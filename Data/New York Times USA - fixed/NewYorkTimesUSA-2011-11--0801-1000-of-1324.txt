HEADLINE: Panel Hears Defense Of Loan to Solyndra

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The bankruptcy of Solyndra, the solar power company that took $528 million in government loans, was ''extremely unfortunate,'' Steven Chu, the energy secretary, told lawmakers on Thursday. But he rejected a suggestion put forward by a Republican that he or his department should apologize.
Companies fail when ''the bottom of the market falls out,'' Dr. Chu testified before a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. That, he said, is what happened to the solar panel business, for two reasons that he maintained could not be foreseen.
''This company and several others got caught in a very, very bad tsunami,'' he said. New plants to manufacture solar panels started up in China and elsewhere, while the market for the panels was softening because of economic troubles in Europe. Prices dropped 70 percent in two and a half years, he said. 
But Republicans pursued the theme that the problem was incompetence and political influence. Clifford Stearns of Florida, chairman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee, which held the hearing, said, ''it is readily apparent that senior officials in the administration put politics before the stewardship of taxpayer dollars.''
Dr. Chu said he had come into office in January 2009 trying to speed up a loan guarantee process that had been established by a 2005 law, but which had not at that point resulted in any actual loans. His goal, he said, was to create jobs in a faltering economy.
Dr. Chu also stressed that private investors had put more than half a billion dollars into Solyndra, which had a new design for lightweight solar modules.
''When it comes to the clean energy race, America faces a simple choice: compete or accept defeat,'' he said. ''I believe we can and must compete.''
His prepared testimony also made an indirect dig at some members of Congress. ''We appreciate the support the loan programs have received from many members of Congress -- including nearly 500 letters to the department -- who have urged us to accelerate our efforts and to fund worthy projects in their states,'' the statement said.
Mr. Stearns, though, complained that the policy was an effort to keep President Obama on a ''green jobs pedestal.''
''Two of the first three deals approved under Secretary Chu's acceleration policy have now blown up and filed for bankruptcy,'' he said, referring as well to a Massachusetts energy storage company, Beacon Power. ''No one has admitted any fault whatsoever, and the president and our Democrat colleagues just shrug and say, ''Hey, sometimes things don't work out.' ''
Dr. Chu was the only witness.
The hearing has two focuses: the business judgment of the Energy Department and the White House, and the possibility of political influence. The chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, asked in an opening statement, ''What did Secretary Chu know about the situation at Solyndra, and when did he know it, and how did he act on this information, if at all?''
The form of the question mirrors what was asked 35 years ago about President Richard Nixon's involvement in the Watergate break-in.
''We have heard from President Obama, and even from you, Secretary Chu, that nobody had a crystal ball and no one could have predicted Solyndra's demise,'' he said. ''But the truth is, the D.O.E. staff did predict this -- one of the models reviewed by D.O.E. staff specifically showed that Solyndra would run out of cash in September 2011.''
And the company's auditors said six months after the initial loan agreement was completed that Solyndra would have problems, he pointed out.
For the most part, Democrats are not defending the government's judgment in making the loan.
But Representative John D. Dingell, also of Michigan, questioned in his opening statement the Republicans' other contention, that the loan was rushed through because one of the investors, George Kaiser, an Oklahoma oil and gas billionaire, was a ''bundler'' for the Obama campaign.
''I have yet to be presented with a single piece of evidence that President Obama, Vice President Biden or any of their staffs used political pressure on D.O.E. to circumvent the normal vetting process, an assumption/presumption that my Republican colleagues continue to propagate for media attention,'' he said.
Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, said that political influence by Mr. Kaiser was inevitable.
''It's the elephant in the room,'' he said. ''Everybody and their dog at D.O.E. knew who he was.''
Republican questioners were alternately respectful of Dr. Chu, who won a Nobel Prize in physics, and condescending.
Joe Barton of Texas praised Dr. Chu's integrity but asked about a decision that Dr. Chu approved, to allow Solyndra to restructure its loan and take in new money, putting the government second in line for reimbursement in case of liquidation. He said the 2005 law that established the loan program that said that in case of liquidation, the government ''shall be'' first in line.
''Do you understand what the word 'shall' means?'' he asked.
Mr. Stearns asked Dr. Chu whether the White House's appointment of an outside expert to review the loan guarantee program reflected badly on the secretary. ''Doesn't this mean, simply, it does to me, that the president has lost confidence in you, your acumen, your financial acumen?'' he asked.
Dr. Chu replied, ''we welcome outside eyes.''
Mr. Stearns said, ''you don't take it as a personal affront on your integrity?''
''No,'' said Dr. Chu.
Speaking to reporters at the end of about five hours of statements and testimony, all parties sounded feisty. Dr. Chu said: ''We really have nothing to hide; we really have nothing to be ashamed about.''
He added that the government would have to help incubate new manufacturing industries, because this played to ''the U.S. technological sweet spot,'' which is the development of new technologies.
Mr. Stearns was later asked if he thought Dr. Chu should be fired. ''My personal opinion is I think possibly he should be reassigned,'' he said.
Mr. Barton was more charitable, but darker. ''I think Secretary Chu is trying to be a team player,'' he said. ''I think probably he is taking the heat for some decisions out of his control.''

HEADLINE: Laid Off and Struggling To Provide, but Hoping Daughters Will Get Out

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Ever since her high school took her on a college tour, Natalia Burks has had her heart set on going to Morgan State University in Baltimore to study forensic science. She has no connection to Baltimore, having grown up in subsidized housing on Edgecombe Avenue in West Harlem. But there was something about the romance of that tour that made Ms. Burks, now 18, believe she could go outside the customary boundaries of her life.
She took night remedial classes for six months so she could graduate on time with the rest of her class at Manhattan/Hunter Science High School, a small public school on the Upper West Side. She graduated in June, a year after her mother, Chonise Blackson, was laid off from St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, where she had worked for 23 years.
'' 'I really want to make money, Ma,' '' Ms. Blackson recalled her saying. '' 'I want to get you out of here.' '' 
To which Ms. Blackson replied, ''You get yourself out.''
Ms. Blackson is no longer able to provide as well as she once did for Natalia and her younger daughter, Janiya Spencer, who will turn 4 next week. She is still in disbelief that she no longer has her job at St. Vincent's, where she started in 1987 as a file clerk in the medical records department and worked her way up to medical records analyst.
At the time she was laid off, she was assembling and preparing 75 to 200 paper charts a day, she said.
Although St. Vincent's, founded in 1849, had flirted with bankruptcy for years, Ms. Blackson was not alone in fantasizing that someone would pull a last-minute rescue out of a hat. After all, this was the hospital that had responded to the sinking of the Titanic and the toppling of the World Trade Center. When it filed for bankruptcy in April 2010, it was the last full-service Roman Catholic hospital in New York City.
''I didn't understand why the pope -- he didn't come out and do nothing,'' Ms. Blackson said.
She had been laid off before. She got her job at St. Vincent's through a temporary agency after being let go as a messenger on Wall Street in 1987, the year of Black Monday, when stock markets crashed around the world. But now, at 46, she is more than two decades older, with two children to care for and few skills to give her an edge in the job market.
When she interviewed at Continuum, a big hospital group in New York City, she was told that it did not employ medical records analysts. Other jobs she found through her union, 1199 S.E.I.U., would have required her to work a night shift -- in two cases a long commute away in Brooklyn, and only part time.
Baby sitters wanted to charge her $125 a day to take care of Janiya. At that rate, Ms. Blackson said, she would be better off continuing to collect $315 a week in post-tax unemployment benefits.
Ms. Blackson is sociable, a trait that served her well at St. Vincent's, where the nuns ''adored'' her, she said. When she took Janiya out to play in St. Nicholas Park, two blocks from her home, other children and mothers came over to greet her.
But she has had bad luck with men. Natalia's father was in jail for many years, she said. When he got out, she said, he was given a diagnosis of mental illness. As for Janiya's father, he got in with the wrong crowd, she said. She has filed a petition for child support but is thinking of dropping it because, she said, the judge has asked too many questions about her personal life.
''I wish I was married, but it just doesn't happen,'' she lamented.
As the months of unemployment wore on, Ms. Blackson struggled to afford laundry, toothpaste and toilet paper. She fell behind on her rent and racked up credit card bills by charging necessities at J. C. Penney. The Children's Aid Society, which runs a preschool program that Janiya attended, stepped in to help. One of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, the organization granted her $1,301.80 to cover back rent. She also cut back on her cable service, giving up Encore and Cinemax, which showed too much sex for her taste anyway.
Since then, Natalia has taken a retailing job at an Ugg store. ''She likes it because she likes Uggs,'' said her mother, who is taking algebra and computer courses.
As she walked home from the park, wiping ice cream from Janiya's chin, Ms. Blackson reflected on her two goals: a 9-to-5 job for herself and college for Natalia. Ms. Blackson has a mother's faith in her daughter. ''When she's determined to do something,'' she said, Natalia does it.

HEADLINE: 200 Are Arrested As Protesters Clash With the Police

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY; Reporting was contributed by Matt Flegenheimer, Steven Greenhouse, Rob Harris, Colin Moynihan, Katharine Q. Seelye and Kate Taylor from New York; Dan Frosch from Denver; Ian Lovett from Los Angeles; Sean Collins Walsh from Philadelphia; Malia Wollan from Berkeley, Calif.; and Lee van der Voo from Portland, Ore.

 BODY:
Thousands of protesters across the country flooded streets, squares, bridges and banks on Thursday, snarling traffic and often clashing with the police in a show of support for the Occupy Wall Street movement, two months to the day after the demonstration began.
In Lower Manhattan, protesters tossed aside metal barricades to converge again on Zuccotti Park after failing in an attempt to shut down the New York Stock Exchange. In Los Angeles, more than 20 protesters were arrested after ignoring orders to vacate streets. In Denver, 100 protesters marched by government buildings and intersections, bringing traffic to a standstill. 
Organized weeks ago, the so-called day of action came two days after the police cleared the Occupy Wall Street encampment from Zuccotti Park in Manhattan in an early morning raid. After the protesters were ousted from the park that had become their de facto headquarters, a judge agreed that they could return later that day, albeit without their camping gear. They looked to Thursday to gauge the support and mettle that the movement had retained.
''We failed to close the stock exchange, but we took back our park,'' said Adam Farooqui, 25, of Queens. ''That was a real victory.''
Throughout Manhattan on Thursday, more than 200 people had been arrested by the evening, many after rough confrontations with the police. The police said that 5 protesters were charged with felony assault, and that 7 officers and 10 protesters were injured.
In more than a dozen cities, the demonstrations included marches across bridges, which protesters said were emblematic of a deteriorating public infrastructure.
Shortly before 6 p.m., about 60 protesters, including a New York City councilman, Jumaane D. Williams, were arrested for blocking a roadway that leads to the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge.
Also arrested were one of the city's top labor leaders, George Gresham, president of 1199/S.E.I.U., United Healthcare Workers East, and Mary Kay Henry, the president of the nationwide Service Employees International Union.
Protesters, many carrying candles, later filed across the bridge's pedestrian walkway and crossed the East River.
The demonstrations came as encampments nationwide were being cleared out by city officials. In Philadelphia on Thursday, about 75 members of Occupy Philly met to discuss how to respond to city notices, posted on Wednesday, urging them to leave their encampment because construction plans were imminent.
In Oakland, Calif., where protesters have had sharp confrontations with the police, members of the Occupy movement chose not to participate in the call to action, shifting its next protest to Saturday in an effort to ''continue this national momentum,'' according to the group's Web site.
The events on Thursday in New York City began shortly before 8 a.m. Throughout the morning, the protesters wound their way through the heart of the financial district in a cat-and-mouse game with the police. At one point, the protesters engulfed police vehicles, forcing them to halt, and broke police lines, only to be pushed back by metal barricades and swinging batons.
The stock exchange opened for trading as usual at 9:30 a.m.
The marchers returned to Zuccotti Park, hoisted the police barricades that had been encircling it and rushed past officers, some of whom began shoving demonstrators and throwing punches.
In the early afternoon, a protester was led from the park with blood streaming down his face. The police said he had thrown a small battery at officers and taken a deputy inspector's hat. The man, who the police said identified himself as Brandon Watts, 20, was charged with attempted assault and grand larceny. The authorities said that he had been arrested at least four times since the Occupy Wall Street demonstration began and that when he was arrested Thursday, he resisted arrest and struck his head when officers brought him down.
At a news conference at Bellevue Hospital Center, where an officer with a cut hand had received 20 stitches, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that some protesters ''deliberately pursued violence'' and that ''the police maintained incredible restraint.''
Protesters had planned to ''occupy the subways'' throughout the city at 3 p.m., but the turnout of protesters on the trains was scant. At 5 p.m., thousands of protesters and members of about a dozen unions converged on Foley Square. ''It's magnificent,'' Laurel Sturt, 55, who teaches elementary school in the Bronx, said as she gazed at the crowd. ''All great movements of the past started like this.''
At a Midtown gathering of business leaders on Thursday, Mr. Bloomberg said that the protests were a dire sign of the public's economic fears.
''The public is getting scared,'' he said. ''They don't know what to do, and they're going to strike out.'' He added, ''They just know the system isn't working, and they don't want to wait around.''

HEADLINE: Researchers Work to Ease Effects of Oil Sand Extraction

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
Several years ago, Paul Painter, a professor of polymer science at Pennsylvania State University, saw a news report about the deaths of hundreds of ducks that landed on a tailings pond near an oil sands mine in the Canadian province of Alberta. The ducks had become coated with residual petroleum floating on the pond, which was filled with wastewater from the process used to extract oil from the strip-mined sands.
''It wasn't that I'm a rabid environmentalist,'' Dr. Painter said recently. ''It just occurred to me that we were working with something that might prove useful.'' 
That something was an ionic liquid, a salt that, unlike ordinary table salt, is liquid at temperatures below the boiling point of water. Dr. Painter had been using ionic liquids to try to get nanoparticles to mix with polymers, but he realized that they could also be used to help separate different materials -- in this case, oil from sand.
Dr. Painter has since demonstrated in the laboratory that ionic liquids have the potential for greatly reducing the amount of water used in the oil sands industry. If he can scale up the process, and if it is adopted, it could go a long way to making the oil sands industry more environmentally sound.
Canada's oil sands are going through boom times, as the world's need for petroleum, and the accompanying rise in prices, has made extraction of so-called unconventional oil economically viable. Last year, the oil sands -- thick, heavy oil called bitumen that is mixed in with sand and clay -- produced about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, half from strip mining of relatively shallow deposits, the other from injecting steam into wells in deeper reserves. More than half of the oil is exported to the United States.
But that production has come at an environmental cost. In strip mining, about 3 to 4 gallons, or about 11.5 to 15 liters, of water are used for every gallon of oil produced, and as the deaths of Dr. Painter's ducks show, the wastewater can be toxic. Steam injection, which heats the bitumen in place so it will flow out of a well like conventional oil, uses far less water. But so much natural gas is used to make the steam that a gallon of oil-sands oil produced in this way results in emissions of the heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide that are several times higher than those from producing a gallon of conventional oil.
The carbon-footprint problem has led several companies to develop alternative approaches to heating the bitumen in deeper reserves.
E-T Energy, a small production company based in Calgary, Alberta, uses electrodes placed in separate wells surrounding a production well. Water is pumped into the electrode wells, current is applied to the electrodes and as a result the water and the surrounding oil sands heat up. The bitumen eventually gets warm enough to be pumped out of the production well.
The technology was developed by Bruce C.W. McGee, chief executive of another Calgary company, McMillan-McGee, which first commercialized the process for cleanup of contaminated sites. In 2004, the company founded E-T Energy to bring the technology to the oil sands. E-T Energy has conducted field tests since 2006 and expects to begin commercial oil production in 2013.
Dr. McGee said the amount of water used in the process is minimal, and that much of the heating -- and thus the use of electricity -- can occur in off-peak hours, making more efficient use of generating capacity. When the production drops off, the wells can be plugged and the entire operation moved a short distance, where it can begin again. ''This is like mining with electrodes,'' he said.
But electrical heating is not the only alternative to steam. Another Calgary company, Petrobank Energy & Resources, burns some of the bitumen in place to heat the rest of it.
Combustion has been tried in one form or another in the oil industry for nearly a century. The Petrobank method, called toe-to-heel air injection, uses a vertical well drilled above the toe, or end, of a horizontal production well. Steam is injected in the vertical well first, but only for two to three months, to warm the bitumen. Then when air is injected, the bitumen begins to burn like a charcoal briquette. The combustion front travels very slowly above the production well, heating the bitumen so that it can be pumped out.
One advantage of the process is that only the heaviest hydrocarbons in the bitumen burn, leaving the higher-quality lighter fractions to drain into the production well, said David McLellan, Petrobank's manager of intellectual property. The bitumen that is produced needs less dilution with other hydrocarbons to be able to flow in a pipeline.
''We're the only production method that upgrades the oil in-situ,'' Mr. McLellan said.
Petrobank, which has run demonstration projects since 2006, has now expanded one of its field test sites, which the company expects will start producing oil in commercial quantities next year.
But getting other companies to use any of these alternative technologies may be difficult.
''You're dealing with an industry that I wouldn't say is the most innovative industry,'' said Dr. McGee, the McMillan-McGee chief executive. ''When you're trying to do a billion-dollar sale, if you have the term 'new technology' attached to it, it doesn't go too far.''
But E-T Energy, Dr. McGee noted, now has an agreement with Total, the French oil company, that gives Total an option to license the technology.
Dr. Painter, the Penn State researcher, said he would face similar hurdles to getting his ionic-liquid separation process adopted.
''It's a large industry and won't move very quickly,'' said Dr. Painter, who is developing a demonstration unit that will allow the economics of the process to be analyzed. ''I don't think a lot of people are going to invest in this unless they see something that gives them numbers.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Legg Mason Luminary Shifts Role

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Bill Miller, a legendary mutual fund manager, said Thursday he was stepping down from the Legg Mason fund that had long made him a star on Wall Street until the volatile years after 2006 brought his fund and his stellar track record hurtling to earth.
For almost 30 years, Mr. Miller has been the portfolio manager of the Legg Mason Value Trust, which he helped found in 1982 as the flagship of Legg Mason Capital Management, a Baltimore-based mutual fund company that now manages more than $660 billion. 
Under his management, the Legg Mason Value Trust outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005, one of the longest winning streaks in mutual fund history. By comparison, Fidelity's star manager, Peter Lynch, beat the market for 11 years, from 1977 to 1990, during his tenure as the manager of the giant Magellan Fund.
Mr. Miller's market-beating streak, and his homespun value-based approach to investing, made him one of the most closely followed stock-pickers on Wall Street and prompted Morningstar, a fund industry research service, to name him its ''fund manager of the decade'' for his performance in the 1990s.
But his Value Trust's performance was badly bruised in the volatile years since 2006, in part because Mr. Miller made a big -- but incorrect -- bet that financial industry stocks would rebound in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. Instead, the stock market became a giant-killer, lurching from crisis to crisis. With its ragged performance, the Value Trust dwindled to $2.8 billion, from $20 billion in its heyday in 2006.
''The crisis was the biggest mistake we made -- not understanding the systemic nature of what was happening,'' Mr. Miller said in an interview Thursday.
Although he said he had coped pretty well after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, ''we had it completely wrong'' from August 2007 to August 2008.
His instincts in those months, based on decades of experience, were that ''you tend to go in, on a contrarian basis, and buy what everyone else is selling,'' he said, before rattling off a long list of crises since 1987 in which that strategy had worked like a charm. ''But what's different this time, over my 30 years of investing, is that contrarian value-based investing just isn't working anymore,'' he continued. ''Stocks go down further than the historic metrics would indicate -- and they stay down.''
Because of weak investor appetite for big blue-chip stocks and near-bottomless demand for the safety of Treasury securities, the dividend yield on the S.& P. 500 -- total dividends divided by stock prices -- is now higher than the 10-year Treasury bond yield, Mr. Miller explained.
''That has happened only twice in the last 50 years or so,'' he said.
Some traders of the last three decades on Wall Street share Mr. Miller's view that today's markets are fundamentally different from the ones in which he built his all-star track record.
''Bill Miller has proven himself to be an outstanding money manager over a long period of time,'' said Byron Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Services. But the last few years have been difficult for money managers like him, Mr. Wien said, because ''it has been much more of a trading environment, rather than one when you could identify an important theme and take advantage of it over a period of a year or longer.''
He added, ''There is no indication of when this will change.''
Mr. Miller's departure from the helm at the Value Trust, and from the role of Legg Mason's chief investment officer, was confirmed by the company on Thursday as part of a succession plan that was first outlined to investors in the spring of 2010 and will be fully effective at the end of April 2012.
Mr. Miller will remain as chairman of Legg Mason Capital Management and will manage the company's Opportunity portfolios, with $1 billion in assets.
The news that he will be turning over the helm of his flagship -- to Sam Peters, his co-manager since last year -- did not prompt any somber notes from Mr. Miller on Thursday. Rather, he recalled some early advice he got about Wall Street.
''An old guy I met in the market when I was young once told me, 'Kid, you want some advice? Survival equals success.' And he didn't survive,'' Mr. Miller said. ''So the people I admire in the market are people who have been able to survive. Surviving for 30 years is plenty.''
Online Correction: November 17, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A headline on an earlier version of this article misstated Mr. Miller's move at Legg Mason. He will no longer manage the flagship fund, but he will remain chairman; he is not retiring.

HEADLINE: Rise of a Euro Doomsayer

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- The euro zone was crumbling, just as he had long predicted, yet Bernard Connolly, Europe's most persistent prophet of doom, still faced a skeptical audience.
''The current policy of lending plus austerity will lead to social unrest,'' Mr. Connolly told investors and policy makers at a conference held this spring in Los Angeles by the Milken Institute, arguing the case that Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain could not simply cut their way to recovery.
''And one should not forget that of the four countries we are talking about, all have had civil wars, fascist dictatorships and revolutions. That is history,'' he concluded, his voice rising above the chortles and gasps coming from the audience and the Europeans on his panel. ''And that is the future if this malignant lunacy of monetary union is pursued and crushes these countries into the ground.'' 
Mr. Connolly has been warning for years that Europe was heading for disaster. As a European Union economist in the early 1990s, he helped design the common currency's framework, but then he was dismissed after he expressed turncoat views. In 1998, just months before the euro's introduction, he predicted that at least one of Europe's weakest countries would face a rising budget deficit, a shrinking economy and a ''downward spiral from which there is no escape unaided. When that happens, the country concerned will be faced with a risk of sovereign default.''
Now, as the European debt crisis that began in Greece threatens to engulf even France along with Italy and Spain, Mr. Connolly's longstanding proposition that the foisting of a common currency upon so many disparate nations would end in ruin is getting a much wider hearing. Hedge funds looking to bet on a euro zone breakup scour his research reports for insights.
Longer-term investors who listened to his decade-long recommendations to steer clear of the bonds of Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are congratulating themselves for not falling into the trap that bankrupted MF Global, the investment firm run until recently by Jon S. Corzine, the former Goldman Sachs executive and New Jersey governor.
And central bankers outside the euro zone are among his most faithful readers.
In 2008, Mark Carney, the governor of the Canadian central bank, cited the British-born Mr. Connolly, along with the far more prominent Nouriel Roubini of New York University and the Harvard economist Kenneth S. Rogoff, as having been among the few who foresaw the global financial crisis. Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England, has become more vocal about the euro zone's problems and is also a longtime follower.
Nicolas Carn, an independent research analyst and money manager who worked previously as chief investment strategist for the London-based hedge fund Odey Asset Management, is one of Mr. Connolly's biggest fans. ''Bernard has influenced me a great deal,'' Mr. Carn said. ''He has shaped my views on Europe and contributed significantly to my investment performance.''
To be sure, Mr. Connolly was not the only analyst who raised early warning flags about the euro project. Economists like Martin Feldstein of Harvard and Paul Krugman, a Princeton economist who writes an Op-Ed page column for The New York Times, have been longtime critics, as were many experts in Britain, which has long been skeptical of the euro. But few have gone on to devote more or less their entire professional career to exposing Europe's monetary fault lines.
Unlike many critics of the euro, Mr. Connolly, 61, plies his trade mostly in private, eschewing cable television programs, opinion pages and policy journals.
He represents a new breed of independent analyst that has come increasingly to the fore since the financial crisis broke in 2008.
As investment banks have cut down on staff and remain constrained by their banking and government relationships, independent analysts like Mr. Connolly, who are mostly pessimistic in outlook, have become highly popular for hedge fund investors who wager large sums of money betting against the currencies, bonds and banks of countries headed for trouble.
Mr. Connolly worked for AIG Financial Products, the banking arm of the insurance company American International Group, until it went into government receivership. He now operates out of a nondescript office in New York, where he is said to pound out as much as 20,000 words of analysis a week.
His insights, like those of other such analysts scattered around the globe, do not come cheap. While the price Mr. Connolly charges is not public, analysts of his stature command, in some cases, as much as $100,000 for a full array of services, including regular meetings and phone calls along with written reports.
And like many of them, Mr. Connolly -- the Oxford-educated son of a bus driver from Manchester -- guards his privacy zealously.
He declined numerous requests to comment for this article. People who know him say that his public reticence is also fed by a lingering anxiety that officials in power will exact some form of revenge.
The origins of that fear, as well as the anger and passion that drive him, date to 1995, when he took a leave from his job with the European Commission to write ''The Rotten Heart of Europe.'' The book was an excoriating history of the failure of the euro's predecessor, the European exchange rate mechanism.
In Britain, where suspicions of common European economic policy ran very high, the book was a hit for its attacks on the architects of the European common currency, including Jacques Delors, the former head of the European Commission, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the French finance official who would go on to run the European Central Bank for eight years.
The book was greeted less enthusiastically in Brussels; Mr. Connolly was told not to return from leave to reclaim his position.
Moreover, the European Commission investigated whether he had disclosed any proprietary information in his book. Investigators found that he had not.
In 2005, when Greek, Portuguese and Irish bonds were trading at rates barely higher than Germany's, Mr. Connolly's work at AIG Financial Products persuaded a small group of hedge funds and independent investors to bet on a euro zone crackup.
They did so by buying the credit-default swaps of what he saw as the most vulnerable European countries.
When fears that those countries would default took off in 2008 and 2009, sending the values of those swaps skyward, they were able to sell -- reaping large profits.
''It took a while, but we finally were able to monetize Bernard's views on Europe,'' said James Aitken, who worked with him at AIG Financial Products and describes his job at the time as translating Mr. Connolly's arcane musings into actual investment strategies.
While other investors have also profited from following Mr. Connolly's advice, Mr. Aitken says that the analyst's true passion is to try to prevent the social and political train wreck he fears is just around the corner.
''He is anguished,'' said Mr. Aitken, who runs his own research service for investors, Aitken Advisors, from his home in London. ''He sees where this is going and is warning against the human tragedy.''
Yra Harris, a trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, is another of Mr. Connolly's supporters in the investment world. ''Bernard is like no one I have ever met,'' he said, citing his work as inspiration for some recent profits he made selling Italian bond futures.
Mr. Harris concedes that Mr. Connolly's reports can be hard going. Indeed, some exceed 70 pages, cite Hegel and John Stuart Mill and include footnotes that can run on for more than a page.
But Mr. Harris is so convinced that Mr. Connolly's views should find a wider audience that he and a colleague have offered to pay Mr. Connolly's publisher $75,000 to reissue 25,000 paperback copies of ''Rotten Heart,'' now out of print.
''I will pay out of my pocket because he has meant so much to me,'' Mr. Harris said. ''Each time I talk to him, it's like I've been to Harvard for four years.''

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Lawmakers Cut Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Rhode Island lawmakers, meeting in a special session on Thursday, passed a pension overhaul bill meant to rein in benefit costs that were growing so fast they threatened to overwhelm the state. 
Both houses passed identical versions of the bill by wide margins after defeating floor amendments that would have shielded public workers from some of its provisions.
''It has to be done. We have no choice,'' said Nicholas A. Mattiello, the state's House majority leader. ''We have a $7.3 billion pension liability in one of the worst economies since the Great Depression. That is a recipe for disaster.''
Rhode Island's pension overhaul was unusual because it included cuts that would affect people who have already retired. Many states and local governments have been trying to reduce ballooning public pension costs, but they almost always leave retirees' benefits untouched. Many are bound by laws, court precedent or constitutional provisions that make public pension reductions difficult or impossible.
The typical approach is to reduce benefits for public employees hired in the future.
Before this year, Rhode Island enacted four milder pension changes, leaving retirees unscathed. But the state's big pension shortfall kept growing. Public employees' unions have sued, arguing that those previous cuts were illegal. They are likely to challenge the new cuts as well.
The latest pension bill was proposed by the state treasurer, Gina Raimondo, a political newcomer who argued that because Rhode Island's fiscal problems were so dire, the only way out was a significant overhaul that would affect all stakeholders, even retirees. She also said the previous attempts at change had put an unfair burden on younger state workers and teachers.
Ms. Raimondo said she thought the bill would put the state's pension system ''on a healthy path.'' Gov. Lincoln D. Chafee called it ''a significant initial step,'' but said he remained concerned about dozens of small municipal pension funds that the bill did not touch.

AFRICAN UNION MAY DEPLOY
ETHIOPIAN TROOPS TO SOMALIA
The African Union is considering an ambitious plan to stabilize Somalia that could involve using thousands of Ethiopian troops to open a new front against the Shabab militant group, officials of the union said. African Union peacekeepers are already battling militants in Mogadishu, but the prospect of Ethiopian troops returning to Somalia revives Ethiopia's bitter history there. Page A4

A Hamas-appointed court ordered two major banks in Gaza to pay tens of millions of dollars in back fees and fines for refusing to accept the taxing power of the Hamas government, rather than its West-Bank-based rival, the Palestinian Authority. The decision also bans 11 members of the bank's board of directors from leaving Gaza. Page A4

HEADLINE: Making Sense Of Patent Law

BYLINE: By REYNOLDS HOLDING and ROBERT COLE

 BODY:
The United States Supreme Court has a chance to reverse the mission creep in patent law. The system is supposed to reward inventors but not stifle innovation. Fuzzy and overly broad concepts like thought processes generally are not protected. Yet one company, Prometheus Laboratories, reckons it owns a method for interpreting how patients react to a drug.
Thomas Jefferson, the nation's first patent commissioner, questioned whether ideas should be owned at all. In 1840, a skeptical lower court limited patents to specific inventions. The Supreme Court followed suit in 1853, rejecting a claim from Samuel Morse. The justices said Mr. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph, had sought patent protection so broad that it would block discoveries he had not even thought of. 
That principle guided American law for more than a century. A crack appeared in 1972, when the Supreme Court first considered software patents. Even then, though, the justices ruled them invalid unless tied to a specific use. But by 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the nation's top patent court, was blessing protection for virtually any software with a practical purpose.
The court may have been trying to promote technological advances. But the real-life effect was to gut the rule that had prevented the patenting of abstract ideas in areas like medical research.
In 2004, Prometheus claimed the Mayo Clinic had infringed a patent on a seemingly simple process for diagnosing patients. The procedure was the kind of analysis based on observation that doctors do every day, the clinic maintained. But the Federal Circuit upheld the patent. The Supreme Court is to hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 7.
The seven years of litigation are one cost of a broken system. The number of federal patent infringement lawsuits has soared, to more than 3,300 last year from about 800 in 1980. Legal experts say the suits have cost companies hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
But the greater expense may be lost innovation. The risk of getting sued discourages research investment and delays medical breakthroughs -- the opposite of what those who devised the patent system intended. Reversing years of damaging precedents is hard, but a Supreme Court ruling against Prometheus would be a start.
Taking Stock
Investors may be rethinking the inherent riskiness of equities, especially compared with bonds. It's a logical response to seismic shifts in the European sovereign debt markets.
Normally, shares would be expected to suffer alongside bonds in these troubled times. After all, equities come at the bottom of the creditors' pecking order, making them among the riskiest of financial assets. Investors might be expected to flee from stocks since bond market woes reflect, at least in part, fears of recession.
But leading equity indexes like the Stoxx 600 and MSCI World have suffered only modest falls recently. United States shares show gains over the short and medium term. And the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers suggests that equity market sentiment is improving, especially in the United States.
Several factors sustain hope for shares. The crisis has cut into the appeal of bonds. Euro zone sovereign risk, once thought minute, has grown. The mere possibility that governments might default on their debt makes all bonds look relatively more risky, and shares relatively less so.
Meanwhile, companies on average have strong enough balance sheets to weather what is essentially a debt crisis. Aside from financial stocks, companies tend not to have exposure to government bonds.
True, the economic outlook means that corporate earnings growth may slow. But Thomson Reuters' Starmine database suggests that year-on-year earnings, globally, will rise 11.8 percent over the next 12 months. That may be tougher in Europe, but if continuing euro zone woes prompt concerted intervention from, say, the European Central Bank, euro shares could benefit alongside bonds.
For multinationals, exposure to global industrial consumer markets is a plus. In general, corporate cash flows underpin, though still do not guarantee, valuations. Compared with historical norms, those valuations suggest shares have limited scope for further declines, barring complete catastrophe. And the prices of traditionally safe assets like United States Treasuries or gold already look high.
Equities are not invincible. But they are pretty well equipped for these rough times.

Sarah Benson directs this collaboration by Soho Rep, Piece by Piece Productions and Rising Phoenix Repertory. The Hauptmann Residence, (212) 352-3101, hauptmannresidence.com. (Rooney)
'An Evening With Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin' (in previews; opens on Monday) With a major revival of ''Evita'' due this spring, these two performers -- who appeared together on Broadway for the first time in that show as Eva Peron and Che (and took home matching Tony Awards) -- reunite to reminisce and perform some of the greatest material written for the stage. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Happy Hour' (in previews; opens on Dec. 5) Before he started rubbing shoulders with Woody Allen and Elaine May with ''Relatively Speaking'' on Broadway, the filmmaker Ethan Coen was regularly cooking up one-act comedy trilogies for the Atlantic Theater Company. His third set, again directed by Neil Pepe, appears to be ironically titled given its lineup of an embittered barfly, two lonely young people blind to their mutual compatibility, and a suicidal business traveler. Peter Norton Space at Signature Theater Company, 552 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Lysistrata Jones' (in previews; opens on Dec. 14) Douglas Carter Beane and Lewis Flinn's literally bouncy Aristophanes update transports the sexually withholding women of ancient Greece onto the basketball court of modern-day Athens University. ''It's Your Duty: No More Booty'' becomes the girls' strategy to spur their guys to a win. Directed and choreographed by Dan Knechtges, this Transport Group production graduates from its site-specific Off Broadway run to the big time in a season that so far is light on new musicals. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Maple and Vine' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Dec. 7) Jordan Harrison returns to Playwrights Horizons, where his ''Doris to Darlene'' was presented, with this new play about a couple who have become allergic to their 21st-century lives and find solace in the simpler pleasures of the 1950s. Anne Kauffman directs a five-member ensemble that includes the always-riveting Marin Ireland. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever' (in previews; opens on Dec. 11) Daisy Gamble has become David in Michael Mayer's reconceived production of the much-loved but seldom-seen Burton Lane and Alan Jay Lerner musical about a widowed psychiatrist who becomes romantically bewitched by the previous-life incarnation of one of his patients. Peter Parnell wrote the new book for the show, which stars Harry Connick Jr., David Turner and Jessie Mueller. St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Once' (in previews; opens on Dec. 6) The micro-budget 2007 Irish independent film about the romance between two musicians -- one a Dubliner, the other a Czech immigrant -- became a surprise hit and made international music stars (and Oscar-winning songwriters) of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Brought to the stage by the playwright Enda Walsh and the director and the choreographer of ''Black Watch,'' John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett, this musical is being eyed by theater pundits as a potential Broadway entry. It stars Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Rooney)
'Seminar' (in previews; opens on Sunday) The in-demand director Sam Gold makes his Broadway debut with this new comedy from Theresa Rebeck. Lily Rabe, Hamish Linklater, Jerry O'Connell and Hettienne Park play aspiring novelists who sign up for classes with a formidable international literary lion, endowed with the acid tongue and droll delivery of Alan Rickman. John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Stick Fly' (in previews; opens on Dec. 8) A well-heeled African-American family's mellow weekend on Martha's Vineyard turns tense when two adult sons introduce their girlfriends in Lydia R. Diamond's play. Kenny Leon directs a cast that includes Dule Hill, Mekhi Phifer, Tracie Thoms and Ruben Santiago-Hudson. The Broadway premiere features original music by the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, who is also one of the producers.

'Wild Animals You Should Know' (in previews; opens on Sunday) A wilderness scout camp provides the setting for an erotically charged game of cat and mouse between two unlikely male friends in this new play by Thomas Higgins. Directed by Trip Cullman, the MCC Theater production has a six-member cast that includes Patrick Breen, Gideon Glick and Alice Ripley.

Broadway
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Chinglish' David Henry Hwang's sporadically funny comedy about a bewildered American businessman seeking his fortune in capitalist China is laid out with the frame-by-frame exactness of a comic strip. That means this bilingual production is easy to follow but hard to embrace with enthusiasm. Leigh Silverman directs (2:00). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Follies' The Kennedy Center's revival of James Goldman and Stephen Sondheim's musical about a reunion of Ziegfeld-style performers looks back as much in anger as in fondness, and that's what makes it so vibrant. Eric Schaeffer directs an electric cast led by Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein and Ron Raines (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Not a natural song-and-dance man, Daniel Radcliffe tries really, really hard as the amoral hero of this 1961 Frank Loesser musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway' This impossibly talented, impossibly energetic actor practices safe sex like nobody else. His polished song-and-dance show is like a great, guilt-free platonic one-night stand. All he asks is that you love him loving you loving him. It's hard to deny him that (2:00). Broadhurst Theatre, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Man and Boy' When Frank Langella plays good, he's fine; but when he's bad, he's a wonder. Here the actor who starred as Dracula and Nixon is charismatically amoral as a 1930s financier who wreaks havoc with other people's money. He is also the one compelling reason to see this revival of Terence Rattigan's 1963 drama, directed by Maria Aitken (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'The Mountaintop' Katori Hall's surprisingly thin new drama, which won the 2010 Olivier Award, depicts the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Samuel L. Jackson) and his encounter with a feisty motel maid (Angela Bassett). Perhaps best regarded as a comfort play, a nursery-room fable for grownups (1:40). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime five-member cast who expertly elicit the pain and the comfort of blood ties: Stockard Channing, Rachel Griffiths, Stacy Keach, Judith Light and Thomas Sadoski (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Relatively Speaking' This slight but mostly enjoyable trio of short plays by Ethan Coen, Elaine May and Woody Allen won't do much to burnish their established reputations, but the show is chock full of nifty shtick. Marlo Thomas delights as a pampered princess with a dead husband in Ms. May's contribution (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, lincolncenter.org. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
- 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the Apple co-founder's life and vision into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Asuncion' Jesse Eisenberg plays a confirmed slacker in a bromance with his former African studies professor (Justin Bartha) in this genial wisp of a comedy written by Mr. Eisenberg (1:40). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, rattlestick.org. (Isherwood)
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
'The Blue Flower' Jim Bauer's alluring music isn't enough to give this high-minded muddle of a musical sufficient cogency as it races across Europe in the early decades of the 20th century, telling a convoluted story of artists and scientists in love and war (2:15). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'Burmese Days' George Orwell's first novel, a blistering look at the dwindling days of the British Raj, receives a dutiful but rather sluggish adaptation from the Aya Theater Company of London. The adapter-director, Ryan Kiggell, never stops telling even as he's showing, and the dense text gets the better of several cast members (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Eric Grode)
'Burning' Thomas Bradshaw's repellent, magnetic play -- about rampaging erotic impulses among untalented show people in New York and neo-Nazis in Berlin -- tramples the lines that divide the good, the bad and the plug ugly in art and in life. Scott Elliott directs a brave if uneven cast in an X-rated production guaranteed to divide audiences (2:45). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Cymbeline' The Fiasco Theater's charming production brings lucidity, credibility and gentle magic to Shakespeare's bulky, convoluted tale of star-crossed lovers and schemers in old Britannia, with a multifarious cast of six on a naked stage. Directed by Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld (2:40). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Dancing at Lughnasa' Charlotte Moore's production falls a little short on atmosphere but works where it counts most, in the spirited performances of the five women playing the poor, unmarriageable Mundy sisters in the fictional Donegal town of Ballybeg in late summer 1936. Two decades after it was first seen, this transporting Tony-winning memory play by the Irish dramatist Brian Friel has lost none of its humanity or delicacy (2:05). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Iron Curtain' This enthusiastic musical comedy set in the 1950s follows a pair of washed-up writers who are kidnapped and taken to the Soviet Union to fix a failing Communist musical (2:30). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, prospecttheater.org, (212) 352-3101. (Ken Jaworowski)
- 'Fragments' Five short pieces by Samuel Beckett, directing with becoming simplicity by Peter Brook and Marie-Helene Estienne, that showcase the writer's peerless gift for theatrical economy, as well as the glinting comic light that shines from much of his work (1:00). Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, tfana.org. (Isherwood)
'Hand to God' The Devil is a sock puppet in this foul-mouthed, fun-packed play by Robert Askins about the urges that drive good men (and women, and boys) to dirty deeds. Exuberantly performed by a great cast led by Steven Boyer as a troubled teenager at odds with his id (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, evensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Isherwood)
- 'The Judy Show: My Life as a Sitcom' The writer and stand-up comic Judy Gold may not have realized her dream of starring in a sitcom about being a 6-foot-3 Jewish lesbian mother of two on the Upper West Side, but she has squeezed several seasons' worth of wry observations about life, career and family into this consistently funny 80-minute monologue, complete with her own droll spins on some classic television theme tunes. For anyone who misses Mary Richards, Maude, Laverne and Shirley, the Bradys, the Partridges and other familiar faces that populated small screens in decades past (primarily the 1970s, but the late '60s, the '80s and the early '90s also get a look), this will be better than an uninterrupted evening of YouTube indulgence (1:20). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Queen of the Mist' Michael John LaChiusa's obsessive musical portrait of an obsessive woman -- Anna Edson Taylor, who went over Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1901 -- features beautiful music but suffers from the monotony of monomania. The formidable Mary Testa plays Taylor (2:25). The Gym at Judson Memorial Church, 243 Thompson Street, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, transportgroup.org. (Brantley)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Silence! The Musical' An ''unauthorized parody'' of the grisly movie with the Hannibal Lecter character crooning noxious songs and Jenn Harris giving a hilarious sendup of Jodie Foster's intense Clarice Starling.

'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
- 'Sons of the Prophet' Stephen Karam's wonderful new play is a comedy about how we endure the unendurable. Santino Fontana leads a flawless cast in a kaleidoscopic portrait of the woes that befall a family of Lebanese extraction and the people in their orbit. As smart and funny as it is deeply compassionate (1:45). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)

'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents get to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, despite some overamplification. But most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)

'Big Apple Circus: Dream Big' This one-ring circus may not offer big cats, but it does have large rodents -- a capybara and an African crested porcupine, no less -- in its new show.

Last Chance
'All-American' (closes on Saturday) Julia Brownell's appealing if perhaps too tidy play depicts the struggles of a high school quarterback who happens to be female and who has begun to question her commitment to the sport (1:40). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Isherwood)
'The Atmosphere of Memory' (closes on Sunday) It's hard to decide which is more ludicrous: David Bar Katz's backstage drama about a theatrical family (Mom's Ellen Burstyn, Dad's John Glover) or the play within the play, a weird mashup of Greek tragedy, Strindberg and Gilbert and Sullivan (2:20). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Isherwood)
- 'Bunny' (closes on Sunday) Jack Thorne's one-act about a teenager (Rosie Wyatt) caught in ethnic tension in Luton, England, builds to a taut climax, thanks to its knowing script and a captivating performance by Ms. Wyatt (1:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org, britsoffbroadway.com. (Andy Webster)
'Children' (closes on Saturday) TACT, or the Actors Company Theater, has a crisp revival of this rarely produced play from 1974 by A. R. Gurney (''The Dining Room,'' ''The Cocktail Hour''), which shows how long he has charted the decline of the wealthy white Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture. In the summer of 1970 an old-line family gathers at the summer house the mother (a regal Darrie Lawrence) will be passing on to her three grown children, the prospect of which shakes loose hopes, dreams and secrets. If, in the end, this small, charming play feels a bit slight, Mr. Gurney's genteel command of story and structure are obvious (1:30). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, tactnyc.org. (Daniel M. Gold)
'-------- Done Broke' (closes on Saturday) D. J. Mendel, an Off Off Broadway veteran, puts his all into a role he originated 10 years ago. His Donny is an aging steelworker who, adrift in a river of alcohol, struggles against his declining faculties, fortunes and reproductive organs. Fans of the poetry of dissipation will drink deep from this impressionistic one-man production, a marinade of Tom Waits, Charles Bukowski and Southern moonshine (1:00). Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, brownpapertickets.com. (Webster)
'Dreamless Land' (closes on Sunday) Julia Jarcho wrote and directed this deadpan, dreamlike play, presented by the New York City Players (Richard Maxwell is the artistic director). The production is tight and the cast excellent, but what begins as intriguing becomes tiresomely opaque (1:30). Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 598-0400, abronsartscenter.org. (Saltz)
'The Greenwich Village Follies' (closes on Sunday) Doug Silver and Andrew Frank's musical revue about the history of the Village is enthusiastically played and has a few nice numbers, but it feels slapdash and not nearly polished enough to pay proper tribute to its dynamic neighborhood. Sunday only (1:20). Manhattan Theater Source, 177 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, thegreenwichvillagefollies.com. (Gates)
'King Lear' (closes on Sunday) James Macdonald's production of Shakespeare's tragedy is full of talented, miscast people, including Michael McKean, John Douglas Thompson, Frank Wood and -- most notably -- Sam Waterston as a frail and querulous Lear. As the Fool, the great cerebral clown Bill Irwin stands out amid the prevailing gray slush like a daffodil in February (3:20). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
- 'The Lyons' (closes on Sunday) The actress Linda Lavin and the playwright Nicky Silver slyly reinvent that creaky archetype, the smothering, belittling Jewish mother. This play, Mr. Silver's best in some years, also reinvents his eternal theme of the American family as a sick joke. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes an excellent Michael Esper and Dick Latessa (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Milk Like Sugar' (closes on Sunday) Kirsten Greenidge's provocative play pivots on a pact among three black high school girls to get pregnant at the same time. A terrific cast led by a fierce Tonya Pinkins keeps you hooked even when the play moves into predictable moralizing mode (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Pangs of the Messiah' (closes on Sunday) To whom does the West Bank belong? That is the question posed by Motti Lerner's 1986 play, which follows a family of Zionist settlers being evicted from their homes. When peaceful protests fail, the family increasingly becomes radicalized. The awkwardly translated script can be polemical at times, but the production benefits from brisk direction, strong acting and an unusual focus on the internal destruction caused by radicalization, rather than empathy with the enemy (2:20). Theater at the 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, untitledtheater.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Shadow Boxing' (closes on Sunday) Despite a sweaty, vigorous performance from Jonny Collis-Scurll, this one-man show about a closeted gay boxer stumbles as it blends pugilism and poetic observations. (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org, britsoffbroadway.com. (Webster)

HEADLINE: Some Hopeful Signs for Jobs and Home Construction

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The number of people applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since early April, a sign that layoffs were easing and that hiring might pick up. 
Separately, a Commerce Department report said that builders started slightly fewer homes in October but submitted plans for a wave of apartments, a mixed sign for the struggling housing market.
Weekly applications for jobless benefits dropped by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 388,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the fourth decline in five weeks.
The four-week average, a less volatile measure, dropped to 396,750. That is the first time the average been below 400,000 in seven months.
Applications need to consistently drop below 375,000 to signal sustained job gains. They have not fallen that low since February.
The job market ''is still weak but there are hopeful signs of some modest improvement,'' Steven A. Wood, an economist at Insight Economics, said in a note to clients.
The number of people receiving benefits also fell to the lowest level since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed and the financial crisis intensified.
The benefit rolls fell 57,000 to 3.6 million in the week ended Nov. 5. That is one week behind the applications data. The figure is the lowest since Sept. 20, 2008.
That does not include about three million additional people receiving extended benefits from emergency programs put in place during the recession. All told, 6.8 million people received benefits during the week ended Oct. 29, the latest data available.
A rebound in manufacturing could lead to more hiring. Factory output grew in October for the fourth straight month, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. Production of trucks, electronics and business equipment all rose.
Another report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed that home builders broke ground on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 628,000 homes last month. That is roughly half the 1.2 million that economists equate with a healthy housing market.
But building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose nearly 11 percent. The increase was spurred by a 30 percent increase in apartment permits, which reached its highest level in three years.
Over the last year, apartment permits have surged roughly 63 percent. Permits for single-family homes have increased just 6.6 percent in that span.
Renting has become a preferred option for many Americans who lost their jobs during the recession and were forced to leave their homes. The surge in apartment construction may help increase economic growth, but it has not been enough to offset the steep declines in single-family homebuilding.
Construction starts of single-family homes, which make up about 70 percent of residential home construction, rose nearly 4 percent last month. Starts for apartments, a more volatile category, fell more than 13 percent.
Over all, homebuilding dipped in 2009 to just 554,000 homes, the lowest levels in 50 years. Last year the figure rose to roughly 587,000 homes and this year may not be much better.
Though new homes represent just 20 percent of the overall home market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in taxes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.
After previous recessions, housing accounted for at least 15 percent of economic growth in the United States. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, it has contributed just 4 percent.

HEADLINE: San Diego Union-Tribune Sold to Hotelier for More Than $100 Million

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN and TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
The San Diego Union-Tribune, one of the largest and most influential newspapers in California, was sold to a local developer for ''above'' $110 million, voiceofsandiego.org reported Thursday afternoon. 
Doug Manchester, the chairman of the Manchester Financial Group, bought The Union-Tribune from Platinum Equity, a private equity firm that acquired it in 2009 from its long-time owners, Copley Press, a family-controlled company.
In a brief interview with voiceofsandiego.org, Mr. Manchester, an outspoken supporter of conservative causes, confirmed the approximate price, adding that ''the asking price was a lot higher than that.'' He declined to comment further, saying the parties in the sale had agreed to stay silent until the deal was completed between Nov. 30 and Dec. 15.
The Union-Tribune, like many American newspapers, has suffered from the economic downturn and the defection of readers and advertisers to the Web. The paper has a weekday circulation of nearly 220,000 and a weekend circulation of nearly 300,000, according to recent reports from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
In a statement, Mr. Manchester said: ''Taking ownership of a 143-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning news organization comes with great responsibility. We believe San Diego is the finest city in America and pledge to be strong advocates for the city's interests and conscientious caretakers of The Union-Tribune and its legacy.''
The Manchester Financial Group has a range of investments that once included two of the largest hotels in the United States: the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego and the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina. The hotels, which Mr. Manchester has since sold, were the target of a boycott in 2008 over his $125,000 donation to support a ballot initiative in California to prohibit same-sex marriage in the state.
A statement issued by The Union-Tribune did not disclose the terms of the agreement, saying that the company would not comment on the sale until the ownership transfer was complete. Representatives from Platinum Equity also declined to comment. A Wall Street Journal article in July said the private equity firm paid ''a nominal amount, of less than $50 million,'' when it bought the paper in 2009.
In its statement, The Union-Tribune highlighted the steps Platinum had taken to improve the newspaper's operations, including hiring Ed Moss as publisher and president, lowering advertising rates for small businesses, increasing local news coverage in San Diego communities and starting Vida Latina San Diego, a Spanish-language entertainment magazine.
Mr. Manchester explained that his opposition to same-sex marriage at the time of the ballot initiative was a matter of faith: ''This really is a free-speech, First Amendment issue. While I respect everyone's choice of partner, my Catholic faith and longtime affiliation with the Catholic Church leads me to believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman.''

Jazz
Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/jazz.
J. D. Allen Quartet (Friday through Sunday) The harmonically adventurous tenor saxophonist J. D. Allen has done strong work in recent years with a pianoless trio, featuring the bassist Gregg August and the drummer Rudy Royston. For this engagement he augments that unit with Orrin Evans, a pianist more than capable of joining the conversation, and also a likely catalyst. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Nate Chinen)
- Karl Berger's Stone Workshop Orchestra (Monday) Mr. Berger, the composer, conductor and former guiding spirit of the Creative Music Studio in Woodstock, N.Y., has been presiding over this exploratory large ensemble every Monday night for months, with an open rehearsal at 7:15 p.m. and a performance at 9. The run is coming to an end in a few weeks, and with it the irreducible energy of this band in this space; consider yourself forewarned. At the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $20, or $10 for students and musicians. (Chinen) 
Blue Moon / Oliver Lake Quartet (Friday) Blue Moon is a project of the open-minded drummer Reggie Nicholson, otherwise consisting of the trumpeter Ted Daniel, the saxophonist Gene Ghee and the bassist Michael Logan. Also appearing on this double bill, presented by the New York chapter of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, is a quartet led by the incisive alto saxophonist Oliver Lake, with Craig Harris on trombone, Hill Green on bass and Pheeroan akLaff on drums. At 8 p.m., Community Church of New York, 40 East 35th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, aacm-newyork.com; $30, or $15 for students and seniors. (Chinen)
Etienne Charles (Saturday) On ''Kaiso'' (Culture Shock), his joyous new album, Mr. Charles, a trumpeter and percussionist, explores the affinities between jazz, the music of his calling, and calypso, the music of his culture. (He was born and raised in Trinidad.) It's a good effort that makes you want to see him in person, leading a band like the one he has here. At 9 p.m., 92YTriBeCa, 200 Hudson Street, (212) 601-1000, 92y.org/tribeca; $12 in advance or $15 at the door. (Chinen)
- Gerald Clayton Trio (Tuesday through Nov. 27) This sterling young trio, with Gerald Clayton on piano, Joe Sanders on bass and Justin Brown on drums, has its own language together, trafficking easily in some of jazz's current obsessions -- neo-gospel harmony, aerodynamic rhythm, the exaltation of the vamp -- even when they're refurbishing a standard. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
George Coleman Quintet (Friday through Sunday) A hard-bop tenor saxophonist of voluble expertise, George Coleman works here with the Hammond B-3 organist Larry Goldings and the guitarist Russell Malone, both leaders in the field. On drums is George Coleman Jr., with Daniel Sadownick on percussion on Saturday and Sunday. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30, or $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)
- Chick Corea (Friday through Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday, with shows Nov. 25-27) Mr. Corea has adopted an array of instrumental formats over the years, from solo piano to orchestra, and this month, to commemorate his 70th birthday, he's taking part in a whole mess of them. This weekend he works with accomplished flamenco musicians, including the singer Concha Buika and the guitarist Nino Josele. Next week he engages in duo-piano interplay with two very different partners: the articulate traditionalist Marcus Roberts (Tuesday) and the shape-shifting modernist Herbie Hancock (Wednesday). A full schedule is available at the club's Web site. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $65 cover at tables or $45 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
Cuneiform at the Stone (Friday through Nov. 30, except Mondays) The genre-blending ethos of Cuneiform Records, an independent label out of Silver Spring, Md., finds a regular perch this month at the Stone. Friday's offerings are especially heavy, with the vibraphonist Jason Adasiewicz blowing in from Chicago with the band Rolldown (at 8 p.m.) and the drummer John Hollenbeck leading his Claudia Quintet, augmented by the pianist Matt Mitchell and the vocalist Theo Bleckmann (at 10 p.m.). Visit the club's Web site for a full schedule. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10 cover. (Chinen)
Carlo De Rosa's Cross-Fade (Saturday) As on his sharp recent album, ''Brain Dance'' (Cuneiform), Mr. De Rosa, a bassist, features his own complex music for an ensemble of fellow searchers: Mark Shim on tenor saxophone, Vijay Iyer on piano and Tommy Crane on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $15 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Either/Orchestra (Saturday) The slinky, pentatonic music of Ethiopia has been a steadfast preoccupation of the Either/Orchestra, a big band mainly active in and around Cambridge, Mass. -- and, more to the point, of the saxophonist Russ Gershon, who leads the band and who composed ''The Collected Unconscious,'' the Ethiopian-inspired piece featured here. At 2 p.m., Tishman Auditorium, Parsons New School for Design, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 229-5488, newschool.edu; free. (Chinen)
- Jim Hall Quartet (Friday and Saturday) Jim Hall's economical style and harmonic command have made him a quietly imposing hero of jazz guitar -- and, at 80, an indisputable legend. He has made this engagement an annual tradition, working with a springy and responsive rhythm section. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 general seating or $40 premium seating, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Louis Hayes Jazz Communicators (Friday and Saturday) If the name of the band sounds vaguely reminiscent of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, there's good reason: like Blakey, Mr. Hayes is a locomotive hard-bop drummer with a history of grooming younger players. On this bandstand that includes the saxophonist Vincent Herring and the bassist Santi Debriano. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $30 cover, with a variable minimum. (Chinen)
Bucky Pizzarelli-Ken Peplowski Quintet: American Anthems (Tuesday through Nov. 27) Mr. Pizzarelli, a guitarist, and Mr. Peplowski, a clarinetist and tenor saxophonist, hail from different generations but share a brisk command of the swing and bebop traditions. Here they lead an estimable cohort of Derek Smith on piano, Greg Cohen on bass and Chuck Redd on drums and vibraphone. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 and $35 cover, with students $15 for select sets, with a minimum of $10 at tables or $5 at the bar. (Chinen)
Marc Ribot's Ceramic Dog (Friday) ''Party Intellectuals'' (Pi), released a few years ago, is the perfectly named debut of this ornery, rockish trio, with Mr. Ribot on guitar, Shahzad Ismaily on bass and Ches Smith on drums. The band has an equally convincing way with bruising thrash punk, one-chord-vamp heroics and brooding atmospherics, and in performance any groove is game for mutation. At 9 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, union-pool.com, (718) 609-0484; $10. (Chinen)
Renee Rosnes Quartet (Saturday) Renee Rosnes, a resourceful and highly adaptable pianist, leads a postbop band composed of the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Lewis Nash. At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, 2960 Broadway, at 116th Street, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com; $25. (Chinen)
- Maria Schneider Orchestra (Tuesday through Nov. 27; closed on Thanksgiving) Evocative harmonic coloration and swirling rhythmic undercurrent are two of the chief devices of this large ensemble, led by the composer Maria Schneider. Its annual Thanksgiving week engagement will feature strong contributions -- from the likes of the alto saxophonist Steve Wilson and the pianist Frank Kimbrough -- but its true strength lies in a virtually unsurpassed ensemble cohesion. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $35. (Chinen)
Mary Stallings With Eric Reed Trio (Friday through Sunday) A jazz singer of soulful instinct and deep experience, Ms. Stallings has worked for more than a decade with the poised pianist Eric Reed, on many bandstands and several albums, most recently ''Dream'' (HighNote). Rounding out the rhythm section are Reuben Rogers on bass and Carl Allen on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 to $35 cover, with a minimum of $10 at tables or $5 at the bar; $15 for students at select sets. (Chinen)
Dayna Stephens Quartet (Saturday) Dayna Stephens is a tenor saxophonist of judicious exuberance, originally from the San Francisco Bay Area and now living in New York. His quartet includes some serious talent from among his peer group: the guitarist Julian Lage, the bassist Massimo Biolcati and the drummer Rodney Green. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20 cover, or $10 for members. (Chinen)
Tattoos and Mushrooms (Wednesday) The story behind the name is anyone's guess, but this promising collective relies on the exuberant rapport between Michael Blake, a resourceful tenor and soprano saxophonist; Steven Bernstein, a slide trumpeter and reliable cutup; Marcus Rojas, a tireless tuba player; and Kresten Osgood, a drummer of manic control. At 10 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Doug Wamble Quartet (Friday) A guitarist and singer who melds modern sophistication with an unforced Southern twang, Doug Wamble leads a quartet featuring a like-minded partner up front: John Ellis, a saxophonist of equal parts fluency and grit. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20 cover, or $10 for members. (Chinen)
Paula West (Saturday) Ms. West is a jazz singer of abundant soul and strong musical instinct; she works here with backing from a frequent collaborator, the pianist George Mesterhazy, leading his quartet. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org/jazz; $25 to $70. (Chinen)
Denny Zeitlin (Friday and Saturday) ''Labyrinth'' (Sunnyside), released this year, is the latest sparkling solo piano album by Mr. Zeitlin, a veteran of the format; it's also a point of reference during the first, unaccompanied night of this engagement. The second night will feature Mr. Zeitlin's trio, with Buster Williams and Matt Wilson, which has a rewarding recent album of its own: ''In Concert'' (Sunnyside), released in 2009. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $25 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)

HEADLINE: Loans Lose All Value, And More

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Boscov's, a regional chain of department stores based in Reading, Pa., has received an honor few companies get. Its name, like Google's, has become a verb.
Or at least it has gained that stature in the world of commercial real estate.
Trepp, a data collection and analysis firm, offered the verb form this week after an unfortunate commercial real estate securitization trust disclosed that it took huge losses last month on five department store locations that had been secured by leases to Boscov's.
''To be Boscoved,'' said Trepp, is to suffer losses on a loan of more than 100 percent of the amount lent. That happened on all five of the loans that were included in the Bank of America Commercial Mortgage Series 2006-3, a securitization sold by the bank in 2006.
You might think that, in making a loan, the worst that can happen is to lose all you lent. But in the wonderful world of commercial real estate, you can do much worse. 
That is because the securitizations authorize the bank servicing the loans -- in this case the same bank that made the bad loans -- to keep collecting its fees even if the borrower is not making payments. The servicer is also authorized to take out cash from the securitization for other costs, like paying property taxes or making repairs to keep the property from falling apart.
Those costs can keep coming for a long time after a loan stops producing income. Eventually, the property is foreclosed and sold, and the securitization gets whatever is left after the fees are paid. If the properties are not worth the fees and expenses -- as happened in each one of the five loans on Boscov's stores -- then the securitization is docked for the extra charges.
Eventually can be a long time. Boscov's filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and almost immediately renounced the leases on many of its stores. But the five stores in question were not sold until late October, halting the need for the securitization to keep throwing good money after bad. Wells Fargo, the trustee for the securitization, notified investors of the details last week.
The defaults were simply the latest bad news for the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, which until early this summer appeared to be slowly recovering. In June, nearly $7 billion in new securitizations were sold to investors. That would not have seemed like much in the heady days of 2007, when $45 billion in new securities were sold in a single month. But it was the highest for any month since that year.
Until June, prices of existing securities seemed to be rising, and banks were showing more willingness to make commercial real estate loans and hold on to them until they had enough to package into a securitization. But early this year, the American International Group, encouraged by the seemingly solid market, offered to buy back a package of residential mortgage-backed securities that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had taken when it rescued the insurance giant in 2008. The Fed decided to instead offer the securities to the market.
It turned out that while banks had been happy to mark up values of such securities, they were less interested in actually buying more of them. When the securities began to be sold in June, the low prices being received ''kind of shocked the market,'' said Manus Clancy, senior managing director of Trepp. Investors grew wary of buying new issues, and banks made little money when they securitized the loans they had accumulated. Their desire to make more loans declined, and so did the supply of new securitizations being put together.
At the same time, the proportion of loans in existing securitizations that were delinquent, which had seemed to decline in the spring of this year, began to rise again.
If the commercial mortgage-backed securities market is growing quiet again, that will not cut off all commercial real estate loans, since banks keep some and insurance companies remain active lenders. But without an active securitization market, interest rates could rise at the same time that many loans made at the peak of the market -- in 2006 and 2007 -- need to be refinanced.
Unlike home mortgages, commercial mortgages -- for such things as apartment and office buildings, industrial sites and hotels, as well as retail stores -- normally have maturities of 10 years or less, and need to be refinanced when they come due. As the market heated up early in this decade, maturities grew shorter and more interest-only loans were made. It seems likely that some loans that are now making payments will be unable to be refinanced -- especially since many are underwater, creating the possibility of more defaults.
The Bank of America securitization that bought Boscov's loans may not be the worst-performing deal, but it does seem to have an unusually large number of disastrous loans. Trepp searched its database for loans with losses of more than 100 percent reported in 2010 and 2011, and found 47 of them. No other securitization had more than two such loans, but this deal had six -- the five Boscov's loans that were settled in October and a sixth that was settled in July.
All told, that securitization invested in eight mortgages secured by Boscov's leases, only one of which turned out to be a good loan. Boscov's rejected the leases on the other seven, on properties in Pennsylvania and Maryland. The first one to be liquidated, a store in Upper St. Clair, Pa., was sold late last year, with losses of only 81 percent of the amount lent.
On those seven loans, the costs run up for servicing fees and other expenses amounted to $38 million. But when the properties were sold, the net proceeds amounted to just $27 million. All in all, the securitization lost $126 million on the loans. The loan on the Boscov's store in North Wales, Pa., was the worst of the lot. On a loan of $13.8 million, the loss was $17.3 million, or 126 percent.
It may be worth noting that none of these loans looked especially risky when the securitization was being marketed. All the loans were for less than 70 percent of appraised values. When they were sold, they fetched, on average, about 15 percent of the original appraisals.
The way such securitizations work, the news has not been disastrous for all investors. The losses from defaults first go to junior tranches. When they are wiped out, the losses move to the next higher tranche. This securitization still has some tranches rated AAA, which presumably will escape unscathed. But last month's write-offs caused by the Boscov's loans wiped out three tranches and severely damaged a fourth. Three of those four were originally rated investment grade by Fitch and Standard & Poor's.
Boscov's has emerged from bankruptcy and is operating 40 stores in five states. It was not the borrower on the loans, merely the tenant, and under bankruptcy law it had every right to walk away from the leases on stores it no longer wished to keep.
Curious how it felt to have your name turned into a verb, I called Albert Boscov, the 82-year-old chief executive and son of the chain's founder. Neither he nor two other top executives of the chain returned phone calls, so that question remains unanswered.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The High & Low Finance column on Friday, about some commercial real estate loans that lost more than 100 percent of their value, referred imprecisely to a package of securities that the American International Group offered to buy back earlier this year from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. While they were mortgage-backed securities, they involved residential real estate, not commercial.

HEADLINE: A Push to Promote Familiar Brands Online

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
BETWEEN now and New Year's Eve, food marketers are hoping their products become the soup, frosting, snacks, candy, gravy, cereal and stuffing as dreams are made on.
The arrival of the holiday season always brings a flood of campaigns for mainstay packaged-food brands sold by companies like Campbell Soup, ConAgra, Del Monte, Frito-Lay, General Mills, Goya, Hershey, Kellogg, Kraft Foods, Mars, Nestle, Pinnacle Foods, Reckitt Benckiser, J. M. Smucker and Unilever.
The volume of such ads has intensified since the financial crisis of 2008, as more consumers try to save money by cutting back on dining out. The phrase ''home for the holidays'' is more than the new normal for budget-conscious shoppers; it signals an opportunity for marketers to increase sales of popular brands, revive older brands and bring out new brands. 
More than half of the respondents to a survey released this week by the SymphonyIRI Group, a research company, said they were eating out less often. That does not necessarily translate into happy days for packaged-food marketers, according to the survey, because consumers said they were pessimistic enough about the economy to also take steps like serving less expensive meals at home and forgoing groceries they deem nonessential.
That means marketers must wage a battle to get every box, can, bottle and package they can onto the conveyor belt at the supermarket checkout.
''We do know what's happening in America's kitchens,'' said Mark Addicks, chief marketing officer at General Mills in Golden Valley, Minn., whose brands include Betty Crocker, Big G cereals, Gold Medal, Green Giant, Pillsbury and Yoplait.
For instance, to bolster the Betty Crocker brand, General Mills is stepping up its presence online: at bettycrocker.com; in social media like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube; and on mobile devices, with apps and a mobile Web site, at m.bettycrocker.com.
''We're trying to play where these new generations of consumers are,'' said Geoff Johnson, director for relationship marketing at General Mills, by moving to ''push very aggressively on the digital front.''
Betty Crocker has more than 1.4 million fans on facebook.com/bettycrocker, Mr. Johnson said, adding, ''We feel awesome about that,'' particularly because many ''are under age 35.''
And there are ''hundreds of thousands of interactions a month through devices'' like smartphones, he added, which is ''blowing away our forecast.''
There are also promotional efforts aimed at keeping the brand in the spotlight. They include publicizing the Betty 10, a list of 10 ''red hot holiday trends'' that include ''double desserts'' like pumpkin pie cookies; publishing a new edition of ''The Betty Crocker Cookbook,'' with accompanying apps, e-books and an online presence, at bettycrocker.com/BCcookbook; and promoting the 90th anniversary of the Betty Crocker brand character, introduced in 1921 by a General Mills predecessor, Washburn Crosby.
The character and brand remain ''highly, highly relevant,'' Mr. Addicks said, because they are perceived by consumers as ''authentic, relatable and helpful.''
To underline that, he pointed to sales of Betty Crocker baking products. In the fiscal first quarter for General Mills, which ran from June through August, those sales increased 5 percent from the same period a year ago. ''We're very excited with what we're seeing,'' Mr. Addicks said.
Another General Mills brand, Pillsbury, is also wooing shoppers planning their holiday menus. A campaign carrying the theme ''Holiday ideas made easy'' is getting under way on television, online and in social media like Facebook, where the Pillsbury fan page, at facebook.com/pillsbury, has more than 1.3 million likes.
''Holiday is our biggest time of year,'' said Liz Nordlie, vice president for marketing for Pillsbury refrigerated baked goods at General Mills, ''whether you're preparing for the high-stakes Thanksgiving dinner or looking for ideas for parties or even, on that lazy Saturday morning, you want a warm sweet roll to enjoy with your family.''
The campaign is an evolution of ads that Pillsbury introduced in 2008, which carried the theme ''Home is calling.'' It includes commercials, in lengths of 15 and 60 seconds, that present the Pillsbury Doughboy character helping a family prepare a Christmas dinner chockablock with products like Pillsbury Crescent dinner rolls, pie crust and Grands cinnamon rolls.
The campaign also includes a section of the Pillsbury Web site, at memoriesmadeeasy.pillsbury.com, where visitors will be able to upload photographs to create personalized versions of the 60-second commercial.
''The 'Home is calling' campaign did a fabulous job connecting with consumers emotionally,'' Ms. Nordlie said.
''Our new campaign builds on that, but tries to more directly speak to the products and the benefits of the products,'' she added, by ''showing how easy it is to make our products and how convenient they can be.''
''As a marketer, you can get assumptive,'' Ms. Nordlie said. ''Sometimes you need to take a step back and get back to basics, the basics of your products.'' That is particularly true with younger consumers, she added, for whom ''we have to do more to introduce our products and show how they can fit into their lives.''
Despite the economic cross-currents, ''our business is in a good place,'' Ms. Nordlie said. ''This is our key time of year, but our products have appeal year-round.''

HEADLINE: The Technocratic Nightmare

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
During the first half of the 1990s, I lived in Brussels and wrote about the European Union, among other subjects, for The Wall Street Journal. This was the heyday of European integration. Helmut Kohl, Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Delors were in power, negotiating the Maastricht Treaty and organizing the common currency.
There was a lot of excitement among the civil servants who saw themselves as the architects of a new Europe. But there were some oddities. 
The European leaders would come together for a summit and issue a joint communique. But then if you sampled the coverage in each of the national medias, you felt as though you were reading about 12 entirely different events.
Europe was unifying legalistically and economically, but there was no common language or common conversation. At one meeting, leaders embraced ''federalism,'' but that word meant one thing in Britain and another thing in Germany.
Then there was the elitism. Off the record, Europe's technocrats would say the most blatantly condescending things: History had taught them that Europe's peoples were not to be trusted and government should be run from the top by people like themselves.
As a consequence, European integration was opaque, and consisted of a long series of complicated fudges. When the European Union leaders were compelled to seek popular approval to get the Maastricht Treaty ratified, they sponsored a forlorn rally in a Brussels park. There were E.U. flags and booths and speakers. But the crowd was bored and sparse. At one point, everyone was asked to sing the new European national anthem to the tune of ''Ode to Joy.'' Dead silence. No one knew the new words that had been written to go with that masterpiece.
The European Union is an attempt to build an economic and legal superstructure without a linguistic, cultural, historic and civic base. It was the final of the post-World War II efforts -- the United Nations was among the first -- to build governments that were transnational, passionless and safe.
Over the 17 years since I left Brussels, I've been impressed and surprised that they could keep the E.U. together. The desire for a unified Europe is strong, at least among the leadership class and those over 60.
But now the inherent flaws are undermining the project. The nations of Europe have been running different kinds of economies and different kinds of democracies, reflecting their diverse histories, values and cultures. If you jam diverse economic cultures into a single currency, you're bound to get an explosion.
At this moment of crisis, it is obvious how little moral solidarity undergirds the European pseudostate. Americans in Oregon are barely aware when their tax dollars go to Americans in Arizona. We are one people with one shared destiny. West Germans were willing to pay enormous subsidies to build the former East Germany. They, too, are one people.
But that shared identity doesn't exist between Germans and Greeks, or even between French and Germans. It was easy to be European when it didn't cost anything. When sacrifices are necessary, the European identity dissolves away.
The mess threatens to bring down the European project and European economies. It threatens to send the world into another global recession. (At this point, Chancellor Angela Merkel has more influence over President Obama's re-election chances than Obama himself does.)
On a superficial level, the fault lies with the current European leadership, their addiction to inadequate patches and fudges. But the real problems emerge from the technocratic mind-set, from the arrogant gray men who believe they can engineer society, oblivious to history, language, culture, values and place.
And the final curse is that while building Europe in this way was a mistake, Europeans cannot now simply reverse course. If the euro was immediately dissolved, the Deutschmark would surge, nearly every other currency would plummet and the imbalances would create a global catastrophe.
In the short term, the European Central Bank, the stable European nations and even the U.S. will have to take extremely big and painful action to stabilize the situation. But, after that, it'll be a time for chastening. It'll be time to discard the technocratic mind-set that created this inherently flawed architecture and build a Europe that reflects the organic realities of those diverse societies.
Thinking back on all the complacent conversations I used to have in Brussels, I was struck by a quotation I read this week in The Economist. A European central banker said he had always wondered how Europe's leaders could have stumbled into World War I. ''From the middle of a crisis,'' he said recently, ''you can see how easy it is to make mistakes.''

HEADLINE: Truths and Excesses Do Battle In Speech by Teachers Union Leader

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
In ardently arguing that the emperor has no clothes, Karen Lewis took off her own.
Ms. Lewis, the president of the Chicago Teachers Union, finds herself defending remarks she made six weeks ago in Seattle that belatedly arrived back home via a video spread on the Internet.
Initial reporting tracked a two-minute portion of a 35-minute address. That version, a YouTube posting by the Education Action Group, a conservative organization, caught her mocking Arne Duncan, the education secretary; discussing her own Dartmouth College drug use; and deriding a Chicago Tribune editorial cartoon of her. 
''Lewis goofs on Duncan's lisp, her toking'' was the Sun-Times headline in Tuesday's paper.
Clearly stung, Ms. Lewis, who has apologized to Mr. Duncan, implored attendees at a news conference on Wednesday to ''look at the entire video, and in context.'' In fact, I had. The entire Oct. 1 speech, at the Northwest Conference on Teaching for Social Justice, was more textured, even insightful, but it was still self-immolating.
Ms. Lewis said in the speech that she was ready to retire after teaching chemistry for 20 years. The union stinks and ''they don't want to do any better'' was her take before she became active in an insurgent group.
She was illuminating about the mechanics of a movement inspired by her union's missing the boat, including sitting back passively amid a Daley administration push to replace poor-performing schools with charters employing non-C.T.U. teachers.
Ms. Lewis ambled around the stage without any notes, even taking on different personas, like a defensive Mayor Rahm Emanuel. She gave glimpses of the stand-up comic she had aspired to be, and why we're better off that she chose chemistry.
She rambled but offered a seemingly candid glimpse of C.T.U. ills, notably an overriding focus by the old union leadership on their own jobs and benefits.
''They wanted to be equal to the boss,'' she said. ''O.K., but they were into crazy things, like making the same amount of money and driving the fancy cars and having people driving them around, and wearing a fur coat.''
Her impression of Mr. Emanuel sounded like Jimmy Cagney playing a gangster given to staccato rhetoric. But she was nervy in declaring that the Missile has somehow bought off ministers and community organizations in his longer-school-day crusade.
Then there was her take on their notorious, expletive-filled City Hall tussle. She claimed the mayor lost his cool when she suggested that he cared more about warehousing than about educating youngsters, and perhaps touched a nerve.
She derided two school board members: Henry Bienen, the former Northwestern University president, for being on the board of Bear Stearns when it collapsed, and Penny Pritzker, the Hyatt hotel heiress, as someone who had allowed chambermaids to be paid less than ''a living wage.''
Ms. Lewis affected a snooty voice to mock education-minded Chicago elites supposedly out of touch with the realities of the city's meaner streets. And she denigrated Marilyn Stewart, her predecessor, calling her ''a nice lady, heart in the right place, completely inarticulate, poster child for bad teacher, she had a speech impediment and she was nervous, she didn't prepare herself.''
Ms. Lewis said she inherited staff members who couldn't explain their jobs and feared returning to the classroom. Given the union's middling reputation within organized labor, that rang true.
More ambiguous was her citation of ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,'' an indictment of free-market economic doctrine by Naomi Klein. The book derides the impact of University of Chicago economists, whom Ms. Lewis tagged ''the Chicago boys and the rest of the Ayn Rand crowd.'' At least she reads.
Watch the video and see grievance in action. Watch a smart woman who improbably rose to run her union after politicians and unionists created a system that gives teachers little input as they serve as pinatas for everybody else's experiments.
There was justice in her victory, for sure, but misfortune in that she may lack the professional skills needed to get members the respect they deserve. Her true-believer's fervor suggests she might make the perfect the enemy of the good.
As a teacher, she should know the value of respecting others, especially in public. She failed in Seattle, even as she spoke certain truths and personified an opposition party that need not play nice with Mr. Emanuel.
She has ruffled him, perhaps a bit like Muhammad Ali once denigrated the honorable Joe Frazier, who died last week. But she's no Ali, a victim of government mistreatment who never basked in anger.
And so it was fitting that she proudly and self-pityingly predicted that she would be jailed for defending her troops.
That's not really leadership. It's luxuriating in martyrdom for a cause and praying for your crucifixion.

HEADLINE: A Hero's Welcome, and Tension, for Cuomo

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
COLONIE, N.Y. - Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was received as a hero on Thursday at a meeting of the state's Democratic Party, with elected officials crediting him for several critical victories in local government elections last week, and the governor highlighting those elections as a referendum on his first 10 months in office.
But Mr. Cuomo's appearance before his party's leadership also had signs of continuing tension between the popular governor and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. After he departed, some party members sought unsuccessfully to pass resolutions that would have rebuked parts of Mr. Cuomo's handling of economic and environmental issues. 
A resolution calling for a ban on a controversial form of natural gas extraction known as hydraulic fracturing - which the Cuomo administration is preparing to allow in some parts of the state - was tabled at the meeting. So was a resolution calling for raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers, a step that Mr. Cuomo has opposed.
The state's Democratic Party chairman, Jay Jacobs, said he had opposed the measures because they could ''embarrass the governor.''
''In the current environment, with what the governor's doing, the successes he's had and his leadership, this is exactly the wrong time to send the wrong message,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''And the fact that a very vocal, and I would have to say well-intentioned, minority wants to make their personal views known is not an excuse for us as the Democratic Party to have to engage in that kind of an endorsement that might be looked upon in the press and elsewhere as being opposed to the governor's position, which we're not.''
The governor did not mention taxes or hydrofracking during 15 minutes of remarks to the state committee, and he did not take questions from reporters when he left, exiting through a back door and hopping into a running sport utility vehicle.
In his remarks, at the Desmond Hotel and Conference Center just outside Albany, Mr. Cuomo talked about the challenge of job creation, which has become an increasingly dominant talking point in his remarks at public appearances in recent weeks.
The Democrats on hand remained silent when Mr. Cuomo trumpeted his signature economic achievement, a cap on local property taxes. But they cheered the governor when he mentioned several other topics, including his closing of prisons and juvenile justice centers and the legalization of same-sex marriage.
The governor personally congratulated several Democrats who won local races, including the newly elected mayor of Yonkers and the county executives-elect in Erie and Suffolk Counties, all of whom he campaigned for. He offered their victories, and others in more local races, as evidence that voters were satisfied with the agenda he had pushed in Albany in his first year as governor.
''We ran on our statewide record,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''We said, you elected the Democrats when you elected Cuomo in January, and we delivered for the people of the state, period. We did what we said we were going to do.''
The governor also used the occasion to offer a rare moment of political philosophizing. He said that part of the reason that Democrats in New York were so successful in this month's elections was because Republican candidates framed their campaigns around blaming government, as opposed to reforming it.
''They had an argument that basically says, whatever the problem, it's caused by government,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''That's all they say, over and over and over, and that's not an oversimplification. We argue the exact opposite: that government is possibility. Why? Because government is us. All government is, is the vehicle, the organization, for us, and we believe in us.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Long Shot by Players Is Nudge Toward Deal

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
David Stern tried optimism, transitioned to gloom and dabbled in threats before turning alarmist.
He promised ''enormous consequences'' in September and predicted an ''extraordinary hit'' in October, yet the negotiations kept faltering and games kept disappearing without a new N.B.A. labor deal. Last week, Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, turned acerbic. And on Monday, apocalyptic.
As he surveyed the crisis before him -- the canceled games, the failed talks, a looming federal lawsuit -- Stern forecast a ''nuclear winter.'' 
The players had just disbanded their union and announced plans for an antitrust lawsuit, which they filed the next day. With no union with which to bargain, and no hope for a quick resolution, Stern grimly suggested that the season might be lost.
''It's really a tragedy,'' he said Monday on ESPN.
It sounded like the end times. But this may simply be, at long last, the end game.
After months of dithering and prodding, bluffs, ultimatums and flimsy deadlines, the stakes are now abundantly clear, for players and owners alike.
They either reach a deal in the next six weeks, or forfeit the 2011-12 season, at a cost of about $2 billion to each side.
That threat has always existed, but it was mostly wielded by the owners, who were better positioned to withstand the loss. Some even viewed it as advantageous: After a canceled season, the league could practically impose any labor agreement it wanted.
But the scales may have tipped in the players' favor with the filing of their antitrust complaint. The lawsuit is a long shot, and it could take months or years to resolve. Yet it is precisely that uncertainty that should prod the sides toward a settlement.
If the owners lose the case, they will face treble damages -- perhaps $6 billion, based on a tripling of the players' earnings for one season. Legal experts disagree on whether the players can win on the merits, but they generally agree that the risk to the owners is not worth taking.
''At some point, the sides are going to have to agree to sit down and talk while the threat of litigation is out there,'' said Gabe Feldman, the director of the sports law program at Tulane University. ''Because if they wait for the litigation to play itself out, this season -- and seasons beyond it -- may be gone.''
Underscoring the point: The case management conference for the lawsuit has been set for March 9 in San Francisco. If the 1998-99 lockout is a guide, the N.B.A. needs to be playing games by early February -- with a deal struck in early January -- to stage even a 50-game season.
''I don't think anyone thinks that the intent of the lawsuit is to cancel this season and potentially future seasons,'' Feldman said. ''It's to gain leverage in negotiations. That's clear.''
Even the league's poorest teams now have a seemingly easy decision to make. The Charlotte Bobcats lost an estimated $20 million last season, turning their owner, Michael Jordan, into a negotiating hawk. Yet that sum seems insignificant next to the threat of a multibillion-dollar judgment.
The risk-reward scale tips even further when one considers the concessions the players have already made. Before talks broke down, the players conditionally agreed to a $300 million annual reduction in salaries -- enough to wipe out the N.B.A.'s reported losses -- along with new restrictions on contract lengths, raises and team payrolls. The players' move to accept a 50-50 split of revenues would mean a net gain of at least $3 billion for the owners over a 10-year deal.
Yet an array of relatively minor ''system'' issues derailed the agreement, and pushed the N.B.A. closer to a nuclear winter. The average fan would be mystified that any of these items could cost the N.B.A. the season.
For example, the owners want a higher escrow tax -- a withholding on player salaries. Players disdain the tax. But it is merely a mechanism to ensure the 50-50 split -- which the players have already (conditionally) agreed to.
The league wants to ban luxury tax-paying teams from using the full midlevel exception or from acquiring players through sign-and-trade deals. Yet by the league's accounting, these methods have been seldom-used by taxpaying teams in the last six years. So why is either side still clinging to its position?
The owners and players are arguing over arcane rules that separate taxpayers from tax beneficiaries, rules that ultimately dictate their options in free agency. On every item, the question could be asked, to either side: Is this really worth it?
But the owners are convinced -- as league officials have said many times -- that they need both a new economic model and new restraints on the richest teams, to foster competitive balance. They have shown no willingness to take one without the other.
The players, having made every significant concession over the last four months, finally decided they had compromised enough. So when Stern served his final ultimatum -- to take the deal on the table or have it replaced with a worse offer -- they hit the panic button.
So all eyes now are on the district courts in Minnesota and Northern California, where two separate player lawsuits could determine the N.B.A.'s future.
''I don't think the strategy, at the end of the day, is going to win,'' Samuel Estreicher, a professor of labor law at New York University, said of the antitrust suits.
But it is the threat and the uncertainty that now drive the process.
''Who knows?'' Estreicher said upon further reflection. ''They may get a district judge to buy it.''

HEADLINE: Low Expectations, and Trepidation, Over Meeting a Debt Deadline

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
Expectations that the special Congressional committee will strike a deal on debt reduction by Wednesday's deadline could not be much lower. The committee's own members have played down the odds. Stock prices may already reflect the likelihood of a punt. And one of the major ratings agencies has said the lack of an agreement, by itself, will not result in a downgrade of government debt.
But that does not mean failure will be met with a shrug.
At stake is not simply the country's fiscal health, but also what remains of the government's credibility. Without an agreement in sight, investors, business leaders and consumers, already worried about the deepening crisis in Europe, have begun to brace for the possibility of yet another blow to a fragile recovery, this time from Washington. 
''The decision of the supercommittee goes beyond just the budget. It's become a symbol now of the ability of our elected representatives to get something done,'' said Frank Newport, the editor in chief of Gallup, which tracks public opinion of politics and the economy. ''And if the supercommittee fails, I think the reaction of the public, based on the data, will be even more negative, not just about the government but their confidence in the economy in general.''
As if to underscore this point, the committee's deadline arrives in perfect alignment with the holiday shopping season. Consumer confidence, which collapsed under the threat of a government default this summer, has just begun to convalesce. Business leaders have grown increasingly pessimistic since the summer, with many chief executives pleading for bold action to lower the deficit.
The debt woes now infecting even the larger economies in Europe should serve as a wake-up call in the United States, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, said on Thursday.
Despite those warnings, the special committee has been unable to make much progress. If it fails, $1.2 trillion in cuts will begin to take effect. That outcome was built into the law in the summer, after the debate over raising the debt ceiling brought the country uncomfortably close to default, and was meant to pressure the committee into a resolution.
Lately, there has been talk of a possible two-step solution that merely sets goals for revenue and spending and leaves the details to be worked out later.
Pessimism is running so high, and public approval of Congress is so low, it is not clear that such an outcome would be perceived as a success.
''They're going to agree on anything just to pacify everything for the next six months or a year,'' said Tim Scott, 56, who owns a construction company in Washington State.
''All they're doing is putting a Band-Aid on everything.'' Mr. Scott said he had bought land for a new house but had put off building until the economy's direction became clear.
A weak agreement could send the wrong signal to skittish investors. ''That would introduce uncertainty, and demonstrate the inability of Congress to make decisions,'' said Zane E. Brown, the fixed-income strategist at asset management firm Lord Abbett. ''That supports S.& P.'s contention behind why they downgraded us in the first place and perhaps justifies in their minds an additional downgrade. That is a risk few investors are anticipating.''
In August, Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, cited political brinksmanship in Washington when it downgraded the country from AAA, the agency's top credit rating.
While few analysts actually expect more reductions in the credit rating of the United States, the agencies have left open that possibility.
In mid-September, S.& P. warned of a one-in-three chance that the rating would be cut again within the next two years. The agency has said it will be watching the committee's deliberations.
Moody's confirmed the top rating for American government debt over the summer but with a negative outlook. Even if the committee does not reach an agreement, Moody's said it would probably not lead to a downgrade if the automatic spending cuts went into effect. Some Republicans, though, have promised to prevent the cuts if no agreement is reached.
In polls, Americans have said over and over that they prefer a compromise solution with spending cuts and tax increases, and there is an entrenched perception that politicians will not come together to solve voters' problems.
''For about two weeks after 9/11 there was so much cooperation in Washington you couldn't believe it, it was stunning,'' said Gail Judy, 76, of Concord, N.C. ''Do we have to have another 9/11?''
Though the stakes are less acute than they were this summer, when Americans feared an outright default, some analysts said they worried that failure would damp holiday spending.
''This year, the government could steal Christmas on us, if consumers hear on the 23rd of November that the super committee didn't come up with something,'' said Marshal Cohen, the chief retail analyst at the NPD Group. ''It is going to wreak havoc at the worst possible time for the retailer.''
Treasury bond yields actually fell after the S.& P. downgrade, as investors fled the euro zone in search 0f safer places to put their money. Mr. Brown said another downgrade would cause those same investors to curb their purchases of American bonds, pushing yields higher and driving up the cost of borrowing.
The one event that could still make Treasuries attractive, Mr. Brown said, would be a downgrade of France by the rating agencies.
''The implications of how broadly that would affect all countries in Europe would overwhelm the impact of whatever comes out of the super committee,'' he said.
Low expectations do leave plenty of room for triumph, though. Americans are already feeling so rotten about the economy that the potential upside of a successful negotiation might be greater than the downside of failure.
''I think basically, all the politicians decided that we have to do something to redeem ourselves here a little bit,'' said David F. Gordon, a political risk consultant at Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. ''I think they do realize what's at stake, and that's one reason why we remain optimistic that we will get there.''
Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, a research firm, said failure to reach a deal would produce only marginally negative effects on consumer spending, which has continued to grow despite low confidence. But success -- the spectacle of the federal government functioning as it is supposed to -- could result in a small boost, he said.
Tony Robinson, 52, a vocational rehabilitation coordinator in Knoxville, Tenn., said the committee's mandate of $1.2 trillion in cuts over 10 years was too modest and that a deal was unlikely.
Still, he said, success might turn Congress in a new direction. ''It would be quite a surprise, and it would make me feel good,'' he said. ''In itself, it's a drop in the bucket. But one compromise can lead to another.''

HEADLINE: A Day of Protests as Occupy Movement Marks Two-Month Milestone

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Reporting was contributed by Dan Frosch from Denver; Ian Lovett from Los Angeles; Isolde Raftery from Seattle; Lee van der Voo from Portland, Ore.; Sean Collins Walsh from Philadelphia; Malia Wollan from Berkeley, Calif.; and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

 BODY:
Protesters across the country demonstrated en masse Thursday, snarling rush-hour traffic in several major cities and taking aim at banks as part of a national ''day of action'' to mark the two-month milestone of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
While thousands of protesters clogged the streets in New York and more than 175 people were arrested in clashes with the police, demonstrators elsewhere in the country were largely peaceful, even as the crowds swelled during the evening commute.
Union workers, students, unemployed people and local residents joined the crowds in many cities, adding to a core of Occupy protesters. Among them were members of an umbrella group called the American Dream movement, which represents several unions and social justice groups, who staged protests on or near old, crumbling bridges.
Andy McDonald, a spokesman for the group, said the bridges were meant to highlight the economic emergencies facing many cities, which cannot afford to fix such important parts of their infrastructure. At various points during the day, bridges were blocked in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Houston, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Hartford and Portland, Ore. The biggest event of the day culminated during the evening commute on the Brooklyn Bridge. 
But the precise symbolism of bridges was often muddled, as activists also decried banking practices, called for more jobs and demanded a narrowing of the divide between the richest 1 percent of the population and the other 99 percent.
The protests came at a precarious time for the movement. Cities have been cracking down on the squatters in the Occupy movement, some of whom seem more preoccupied with the fact of their protests than with the future of any movement.
In Los Angeles, demonstrators blocked the Fourth Street bridge near the downtown financial district. More than 20 people were arrested after they ignored an order to vacate the streets. They marched from a Bank of America branch in the morning and set up tents in the middle of Figueroa Street. There were about 1,000 protesters on hand and about 100 police officers, making it perhaps the biggest march yet of Occupy Los Angeles. After the arrests, the crowd quickly dispersed. Lt. Andy Neiman of the Los Angeles police called the protesters ''peaceful.''
In Chicago, where Occupy protesters were never allowed to set up camp in Grant Park, the movement's presence has thinned dramatically since the temperature has dropped in recent weeks. On some nights, fewer than a half dozen protesters remain, pacing the sidewalk across the street from the Federal Reserve Bank downtown, where they have anchored their efforts for 56 days.
But on Thursday afternoon, despite the harsh winds and 30-degree chill, hundreds of protesters re-emerged for the largest showing in Chicago in weeks. Those in the crowd, including members of unions and other advocacy groups, chanted ''Shut it down!'' as they marched to the LaSalle Street Bridge, which spans the Chicago River just north of downtown. The police had already diverted traffic and emptied the bridge by the time the protesters arrived. Still, 46 protesters were arrested after they sat cross-legged in the middle of the bridge before the rest of the crowd continued their march through the city, flooding intersections and streets around the Federal Reserve Bank and the Chicago Board of Trade.
''Day to day we might be thinning because we have no encampment,'' said Andy Manos, who helped organize the marches, adding that just because some protesters have gone indoors at night doesn't mean they have gone away. ''But this is a mobile occupation. This is a model that works for us.''
In Philadelphia, a few hundred people marched across the Market Street Bridge. A row of people, most of them unemployed, sat across the bridge linking arms and wearing signs that said ''Willing to Work'' around their necks. About two dozen people were arrested.
Earlier, about 75 members of Occupy Philly met in a Quaker meetinghouse to discuss how to respond if they were forced to leave their encampment in front of City Hall. The city had posted notices that the activists should leave because a planned construction project was ''imminent.''
But the group did not make a decision about what to do, leading some to express frustration that the movement was becoming mired in logistics rather than expressing a coherent message.
''How do we make a point about why we're here?'' said Markus Schlotterbeck, 23. ''We need to take the high road and make this about bigger issues.''
In Seattle, about 900 marchers shut down University Bridge, near the University of Washington, on Thursday evening. Earlier in the day, the Occupy Seattle encampment was quiet, save for the sounds of a three-person kitchen staff serving up dollops of instant oatmeal to the few who were awake.
Stephan Lee, 26, wearing a black pea coat and his hair in a ponytail, said that about 30 people had agreed to ''stick it out, no matter what happens.'' He said he had hitchhiked to Seattle from Great Falls, Mont., two months ago, and found that the movement in Seattle had become more organized since he arrived.
''People are getting a better bead on what's going on and are learning to communicate better with each other,'' he said. ''We're realizing that we have a common goal, even if we all have different messages.'' That goal, he said, is to uphold American values.
Maria Guillen, 25, said the cold and rain had not hurt morale. ''We are creating this movement little by little, as a people, as a collective,'' she said. ''We can't say what will happen tomorrow.''
In California, protesters with Occupy Oakland, where the police have used tear gas to quell sharp confrontations, chose not to participate in Thursday's call to action, shifting their next planned protest instead to Saturday in an effort to ''continue this national momentum,'' the group said on its Web site.
''Through a day of coordinated actions, we can demonstrate and build upon the potential that the Occupy movement holds in fighting the ruling authorities,'' the group said.
In Dallas, there was no violence, but at least 17 people were arrested after police officers on horseback and in riot gear evicted Occupy protesters from a site near City Hall where they had been camping for the past six weeks.
In Portland, Ore., demonstrators gathered in the pouring rain on the east side of the Steel Bridge, the primary transit hub for the city. But their main focus was on the banks, including Bank of America and Chase. They held a sit-in at a Wells Fargo lobby. About 500 stood outside chanting: ''We got sold out. Banks got bailed out.'' Protesters lined the glass windows while police officers in riot gear stood inside in a row, shielding from view a small group of bank employees.
''You're sexy, you're cute. Take off your riot suit!'' the crowd chanted. About 45 people were arrested.
The crowd included young and old, people from all stripes, and gained momentum and supporters as it marched. A 30-year-old woman who asked not to be identified said she was out for a run when the protesters passed by. She joined them in support, she said, ''because we need a wake-up call.''
Emma Cornell, 57, a former prison educator now teaching courses online, said she drove to Portland from Lakeview, Ore., about five hours away. Until now, Ms. Cornell said, she had followed the movement on Twitter and through small demonstrations in her tiny community, where local Occupy supporters are searching for common ground with resident Tea Party activists. She said the groups differed over whether the solution to the country's problems would involve more government regulation or less.
In Eugene, Ore., about 110 miles south, Occupy protests at banks drew about 200 to 300 people and the police arrested 17 demonstrators on charges of civil disobedience, according to KOIN 6, a CBS affiliate in Portland.
In Denver, about 100 protesters marched through the city, massing at various government buildings and snarling traffic at busy intersections. Flanked by mounted police officers, wide-eyed tourists and Broncos fans who had already gathered at downtown bars in advance of Thursday night's game against the Jets, the protesters shouted, ''This is what democracy looks like'' as they marched.
Jack Kelsh, 47, a city bus driver who had come downtown to join the protesters, said: ''I don't think anything is going to stop this. The more resistance they get, the stronger they are going to get and the more rallies you are going to see.''

HEADLINE: Commodities Lead A Downward Trend

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks and commodities slid on Thursday and the euro erased an earlier gain as concern grew that Europe's debt crisis would worsen and lawmakers would fail to agree on plans to cut the American deficit.
Gauges of commodity producers, technology companies and financial firms dropped more than 2 percent to lead declines among all 10 of the main industry groups in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Alcoa, JPMorgan Chase and American Express each lost about 3 percent to lead the Dow Jones industrial average down 134.86 points, or 1.13 percent, to 11,770.73. The Nasdaq closed down 51.62 points, or 1.96 percent, to 2,587.99. The S.& P. 500 lost 1.68 percent, or 20.78 points, to close at 1,216.13.
Stocks and commodities extended declines after Reuters quoted a euro area official as saying there were no plans for aid for Italy from the European bailout fund. Republicans and Democrats on Congress's supercommittee hardened their positions with less than a week until the deadline to propose a plan to cut the deficit. 
''It's just a combination of everything we have been hearing the last two days,'' said Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at Thornburg Investment Management, based in Santa Fe, N.M. ''It's hard to get excited about a market where there are so many negative macro headlines. Concern over the supercommittee, concern about support for Italy -- the headlines just keep coming.''
Declines in stocks accelerated after the S.& P. 500 slipped below 1,229.10, its closing level on Nov. 9 after that day's 3.7 percent plunge. Jefferies fell 2 percent, paring a loss of as much as 8 percent, after its chief executive, Richard B. Handler, said Wednesday in an e-mail that turmoil around the company's shares and publicly traded debt would ease as the fallout dissipated from the collapse of MF Global Holdings.
Some of MF Global's commodity customers can get an immediate distribution of $520 million, or about 60 percent of their cash collateral, a federal judge ruled on Thursday. The United States Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn approved a request to transfer the funds from James Giddens, the trustee overseeing the liquidation of the brokerage firm.
Oil retreated back below $100 a barrel, falling to $98.93 after surging to as high as $103.37 earlier. Silver futures tumbled 6.9 percent to $31.497 an ounce. Gold futures dropped 54 points to 1,719.8. The dollar strengthened against 11 of 16 major peers. The 10-year note rose 10/32, to 100 10/32. The yield fell to 1.97 percent, from 2.0 percent late Wednesday.
''People are running to cash,'' said Alec Levine, an equity derivatives strategist at Newedge Group in New York. ''The markets, not the policy makers, are controlling events right now and that's a very dangerous place to be. We're seeing every type of assets in the world being sold right now except for Treasuries.''
European stocks retreated after French and Spanish borrowing costs climbed at auctions on Thursday, spurring concern about contagion.
Concern about European debt markets and another potential impasse in Washington overshadowed better-than-estimated economic data that limited losses in stocks in early trading.
Applications for jobless benefits decreased 5,000 in the week ended Nov. 12, to 388,000, the lowest level in seven months, Labor Department data showed. Housing starts decreased 0.3 percent, to a 628,00 annual rate in October, according to the Commerce Department, exceeding the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for a drop to 610,000. Building permits, a proxy for future construction, jumped 10.9 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Uses Cyberspace To Rebut Messages Posted by Extremists

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT; Thom Shanker reported from MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.

 BODY:
MacDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. -- The morning sun had barely cast its fresh light over Tampa Bay when Ardashir Safavi -- born in Iran, a refugee to Turkey, educated in the mid-Atlantic states -- was up and patrolling two dozen Persian-language Web sites, hunting militant adversaries in cyberspace.
His mission was to scan news reports, blogs, social media and online essays to identify those he viewed as ''containing lies, misinformation or just misperceptions'' about American military operations and Pentagon policy across the Middle East.
In recent months, Mr. Safavi and his teammates spotted posts that included doctored photographs of Osama bin Laden purporting to prove that Al Qaeda's leader had not died in an American commando raid. They turned up blogs stating that the Pentagon was accelerating war plans for invading many Muslim nations, and others amplifying Taliban accusations that American troops rape with impunity across Afghanistan. 
Mr. Safavi works as part of the Digital Engagement Team, established in 2008 by the military's Central Command to ''counter extremist ideology, promote cultural awareness and explain U.S. interests,'' said Maj. David E. Nevers, the team's chief officer, who must approve all responses before they are posted on foreign-language Web sites.
The team includes 20 native speakers of Arabic, Dari, Persian, Pashto, Urdu and Russian, the latter a shared language across the Muslim countries of the former Soviet states of Central Asia. Given that Central Command is responsible for military actions in an arc of instability stretching from the Indian Ocean across the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea, people here call their headquarters ''Tampa-stan.''
The government's expanding efforts in computer-network warfare, offense and defense are among the most secret enterprises carried out by the military and intelligence community. To counter the adversary's use of the Internet, American cyberwarriors have hacked into extremist chat rooms to sow confusion, or to inject poisonous code to take down militant Web sites. Sometimes, they choose not to act, but silently track the online movements of jihadists to learn their plans.
In contrast, the Digital Engagement Team operates in total sunshine: all of the online postings carry an official stamp acknowledging sponsorship by Central Command.
The team's operators ''respectfully deflect baseless and often irrational insults, confront adversaries with factual evidence and expose extremist propaganda that might otherwise go unrefuted,'' Major Nevers said. ''All engagements are transparent and attributable.''
The only obfuscation is the use of online pseudonyms to protect the civilian contract employees from potential retaliation.
Mr. Safavi's Internet pen name is drawn from a grand Persian dynasty. On a recent morning, he spotted a provocative Persian posting that inspired an energetic thread of responses criticizing the Pentagon's relationship with a complicated ally, Pakistan, mostly posing theories of Great Game conspiracies pitting spy vs. spy, insurgency vs. military, Washington vs. Islamabad.
The discussion was relevant beyond Mr. Safavi's native Iran, since there are large Persian-speaking populations in Afghanistan and in its northern neighbor Tajikistan.
''You've heard of the Iron Curtain, of course,'' Mr. Safavi said. ''We're here to pierce the Electronic Curtain because the military has decided that it cannot cede this information space to violent extremists.''
Mr. Safavi typed up a translated summary of the Internet exchange, which in a matter of minutes had grown to 29 entries read by thousands more. He proposed a response drawn from Pentagon and State Department policy statements: it described shared American and Pakistani security interests, citing as evidence the large number of Pakistanis in security forces who were killed in battles with insurgents within that country's borders.
Then he sent a message up his chain of command to Major Nevers on a form labeled ''Permission to Engage.''
The Digital Engagement Team works in cyberspace but not at network speeds because translation and approval take hours. Yet it has tried to make a virtue of the demands of oversight. If an offending Web posting is spotted in the early morning, the response is online by early afternoon, landing just as computer users across the Middle East resume their Web surfing in the hours between dinner and sleep.
Parallel to these military efforts, the State Department created a strategic counterterrorism communications center whose online analysts and bloggers try to understand what inspires their target audience -- men 18 to 30 years old, mostly in the Middle East -- to violent extremism, and to find ways to steer them away from that.
''We really want to have an intimate understanding of where they're coming from, what they're saying, how they're saying it, and what drives them,'' said Richard LeBaron, a former American ambassador to Kuwait who is the center's coordinator.
For the State Department's Digital Outreach Team, Arabic- and Urdu-speaking analysts engage extremists in online conversations, identifying themselves as representing the United States government. ''The fact they engage with us indicates we've hit a nerve,'' Mr. LeBaron said. ''They often use horribly abusive language, so our folks have to have thick skins.''
Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism analyst at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, said that despite their limitations, these online outreach campaigns were efficient and inexpensive tools in the government's increasingly holistic approach to combating terrorists, especially as the United States draws down its troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In many respects, Mr. Fishman said, juxtaposing factual images -- videotapes of the hateful preachings of the Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri against the triumphant protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo this year -- can be more powerful, and more effective, than any message the government can transmit.
''Just demonstrate the facts and let reality speak for itself,'' Mr. Fishman said.
Popular Arabic-language Web sites acknowledge the impact of the Digital Engagement Team. A blogger at www.islamtoday.net wrote late last year that the effort ''represents a shift in the style of engagement normally used by Americans with the populations of the region, which usually addresses the elites and the governments in English.''
The blogger acknowledged that the military's online initiative ''is to open a dialogue with readers and Web sites that represent a segment with different interests and opinions,'' and that the Central Command postings in ''smooth Arabic'' were ''often very sophisticated.''
Military officers admit that beyond anecdotal feedback, it is hard to measure the program's impact. Software can tabulate the number of people reading the postings across the foreign-language Web sites where the team engages. But it is impossible to measure whether opinions are changing -- and, if so, whether the team is a significant influence, or simply trying to empty the ocean of militancy one thimble at a time.
''What's most important is that we are engaging in intelligent, honest and forthright discussions,'' said Maj. T. G. Taylor, Central Command's chief of media. ''The fact that more and more forums allow us to participate with their audiences is perhaps a more important measure of our communication efforts.''
One recent effort by the Central Command involved answering a chat room query on what had been accomplished by America's decade-long involvement in Afghanistan. ''Afghans today enjoy more political, economic and social rights than at any time in the history of the country,'' the Digital Engagement Team wrote back. It added, ''The days of public stoning and the beating of women in the streets are over.''

HEADLINE: Obama Addresses Troops at Final Stop in Australia

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
DARWIN, Australia -- Fresh from announcing an expanded American military presence in Australia, a plan that has angered China, President Obama came to this remote northern town that will be the base of operations and told American and Australian troops it is ''the perfect place.''
''We are deepening our alliance and this is the perfect place to do it,'' said Mr. Obama, speaking in a steamy air force hangar to about 2,000 people, mostly Australian troops in green camouflage uniforms but with 55 American Marines salted among them. ''This region has some of the busiest sea lanes in the world.''
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama announced that the United States planned to deploy 2,500 Marines in Australia to shore up alliances in Asia, but the move prompted a sharp response from Beijing, which accused Mr. Obama of escalating military tensions in the region. 
The agreement with Australia amounts to the first long-term expansion of the American military's presence in the Pacific since the end of the Vietnam War. It comes despite budget cuts facing the Pentagon and an increasingly worried reaction from Chinese leaders, who have argued that the United States is seeking to encircle China militarily and economically.
''It may not be quite appropriate to intensify and expand military alliances and may not be in the interest of countries within this region,'' Liu Weimin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in response to the announcement by Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia.
In an address to the Australian Parliament on Thursday morning, Mr. Obama said he had ''made a deliberate and strategic decision -- as a Pacific nation, the United States will play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future.''
The president said the moves were not intended to isolate China, but they were an unmistakable sign that the United States had grown warier of its intentions.
China has invested heavily in military modernization and has begun to deploy long-range aircraft and a more able deep-sea naval force, and it has asserted territorial claims to disputed islands that would give it broad sway over oil and gas rights in the East and South China Seas.
While the new military commitment is relatively modest, Mr. Obama has promoted it as the cornerstone of a strategy to confront more directly the challenge posed by China's rapid advance as an economic and military power. He has also made some progress in creating a new Pacific free-trade zone that would give America's free-market allies in the region some trading privileges that do not immediately extend to China.
Mr. Obama described the deployment as responding to the wishes of democratic allies in the region, from Japan to India. Some allies have expressed concerns that the United States, facing war fatigue and a slackened economy, will cede its leadership role to China.
The president said budget-cutting in Washington -- and the inevitable squeeze on military spending -- would not inhibit his ability to follow through. Defense cuts ''will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia-Pacific,'' he said.
Some analysts in China and elsewhere say they fear that the moves could backfire, risking a cold war-style standoff with China.
''I don't think they're going to be very happy,'' said Mark Valencia, a Hawaii-based senior researcher at the National Bureau of Asian Research, who said the new policy was months in the making. ''I'm not optimistic in the long run as to how this is going to wind up.''
The United States will not build new bases on the continent, but will use Australian facilities instead. Mr. Obama said that Marines would rotate through for joint training and exercises with Australians, and the American Air Force would have increased access to airfields in the nation's Northern Territory.
''We're going to be in a position to more effectively strengthen the security of both of our nations and this region,'' he said.
The United States has had military bases and large forces in Japan and South Korea, in the north Pacific, since the end of World War II, but its presence in Southeast Asia was greatly diminished in the early 1990s with the closing of major bases in the Philippines, at Clark Field and Subic Bay. The new arrangement with Australia will restore a substantial American footprint near the South China Sea, a major commercial route -- including for American exports -- that has been roiled by China's disputed claims of control.
The United States and other Pacific Rim nations are also negotiating to create a free-trade bloc, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that would not initially include China, the world's largest exporter and producer of manufactured goods.
The tentative trade agreement was a topic over the weekend in Honolulu, where Mr. Obama hosted the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and it will be discussed again in Bali, Indonesia, when he becomes the first American president to participate in the East Asia Summit meeting.
For China, the week's developments could suggest an economic and a military encirclement. Top leaders did not immediately comment on Mr. Obama's speech, but Mr. Liu, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, emphasized that it was the United States, not China, seeking to use military power to influence events in Asia.
The Global Times, a state-run news organization known for its nationalist and bellicose commentaries, issued a stronger reaction in an editorial, saying that Australia should be cautious about allowing the United States to use bases there to ''harm China'' and that it risked getting ''caught in the cross-fire.''
Analysts say that Chinese leaders have been caught off guard by what they view as an American campaign to stir up discontent in the region. China may have miscalculated in recent years by restating longstanding territorial claims that would give it broad sway over development rights in the South China Sea, they say. But they argue that Beijing has not sought to project military power far beyond its shores, and has repeatedly proposed to resolve territorial disputes through negotiations.
The United States portrays itself as responding to a new Chinese assertiveness in the region that has alarmed core American allies. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote a recent article in Foreign Policy laying out an expansive case for American involvement in Asia, and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta characterized China's military development as lacking transparency and criticized its assertiveness in the regional waters.
Mr. Obama reached out to China even as he announced the new troop deployment. ''The notion that we fear China is mistaken; the notion that we are looking to exclude China is mistaken,'' he said.
The president said that China would be welcomed into the new trade pact if Beijing was willing to meet the free-trade standards for membership. But such standards would require China to let its currency rise in value, to better protect foreign producers' intellectual property rights and to limit or end subsidies to state-owned companies, all of which would require a major overhaul of China's economic development strategy.
On Thursday, Mr. Obama praised the long chain of alliance between Australia and the United States. Indeed, the mix of Australian troops and American Marines represented the latest in a line of comrades-in-arms from the two countries dating back nearly a century, from World War I through Iraq and Afghanistan.
''It was here in Darwin where our alliance was born,'' Mr. Obama said, at ''Australia's Pearl Harbor'' -- a nickname derived from the town's having been devastated in bombing attacks by the Japanese in 1942, just months after the Pearl Harbor attack.
Ms. Gillard also joined Mr. Obama here to commemorate the 60th anniversary of their nations' official alliance. Before appearing at the base, he and Ms. Gillard laid wreaths at the memorial to the U.S.S. Peary, which was sunk with 80 of its crew when Darwin was bombed in 1942.
After speaking at the Australian military base, Mr. Obama arrived in Bali on Thursday evening for the East Asia Summit on regional security and economic issues.

HEADLINE: Politics and Clean Air

 BODY:
President Obama's decision in September to scuttle stricter national standards for smog may well go down as the worst environmental decision of his administration -- unless, of course, even more damaging retreats lie ahead. The decision was a setback for public health, a victory for industry, which had lobbied strongly against the standards, and a public embarrassment for the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson, who had proposed them. 
The White House insisted that the decision had been made on the merits and that the standards would throw people out of work by burdening industry with costly new rules at a time of economic uncertainty. It also insisted that industry pressure and politics did not play a role. Finally, it argued, the rules could be revisited and strengthened in two years (after the election), when new science would be available.
This page was not impressed by those arguments then and is no less skeptical of them now in light of John M. Broder's exhaustive account in The Times on Thursday of the steps that led up to the decision. The article paints a picture of an aggressive campaign by industry lobbyists and heavyweight trade groups like the American Petroleum Institute that began soon after it became clear that Ms. Jackson was determined to tighten the rules governing allowable ozone levels across the country.
The standards governing ozone -- the main component of harmful smog -- are supposed to be set every five years. But because the standards proposed by the Bush administration in 2008 were seen as inadequate by the scientific community and had been challenged in court, Ms. Jackson decided to set her own standards, tough but achievable. Their health benefits would approximate their costs, and they would not begin to bite for several years, giving industry time to prepare.
Until the very last moment, she believed that Mr. Obama would go along. But as The Times's article made clear, she had very few friends in the White House and many opponents -- not least William Daley, the president's chief of staff, who had been incessantly lobbied by business and by state governors fearful that the rules would cost jobs.
In one telling moment during internal negotiations, E.P.A. experts laid out the numbers on the lives that would be saved and the illnesses avoided by the proposed rules. At which point, Mr. Daley asked: ''What are the health impacts of unemployment?'' -- a question the article describes as ''straight out of the industry playbook.''
Defending its record, the White House cites tougher fuel economy standards and promises to move ahead with new rules governing mercury and other toxic emissions. It is also required under law to begin addressing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. But the very same forces that killed the ozone rule are now mobilizing to delay or weaken these other rules. This time, Mr. Obama should let science and public health, not his electoral prospects, be his guide.

HEADLINE: Perry's Latest Attacks Distort Obama's Words and Past

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
Over the past several days, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has claimed that President Obama called Americans ''lazy.'' And then he sharpened the attack, suggesting that Mr. Obama grew up a child of privilege.
Since he began sliding in the polls last month, Mr. Perry has been increasingly trying to portray himself as the outsider and anti-Washington candidate, attacking the Internal Revenue Service, federal airport security officials and federal judges. He often highlights his own modest personal background, and he has occasionally contrasted it with his rival Mitt Romney's wealthier upbringing, even suggesting that Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, was born holding ''four aces.''
As Mr. Perry has painted himself as the cure for Washington's ills, however, some his recent attacks have drifted into the realm of falsehood, repeating some of the themes of past critiques suggesting that Mr. Obama is elitist. 
Most notably, in a new television commercial released Wednesday, he attacks Mr. Obama for believing ''that Americans are lazy.'' Mr. Perry says in the ad: ''That's pathetic. It's time to clean house in Washington.''
The advertisement begins with a clip of Mr. Obama stating, ''We've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades.''
But Mr. Obama's statement was not about ''Americans'' generally, but about the country's efforts to attract foreign investment. It came in response to a question put to him at a conference last weekend by W. James McNerney Jr., chief executive of Boeing, who had asked him how foreign investors looked at the United States.
Mr. Obama replied that the United States had been complacent in luring foreign investors: ''There are a lot of things that make foreign investors see the U.S. as a great opportunity -- our stability, our openness, our innovative free market culture.''
''But we've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades,'' he said. ''We've kind of taken for granted -- well, people will want to come here -- and we aren't out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America.''
Mr. Perry was not the only Republican contender who sought to capitalize on the line: Mr. Romney also implied that Mr. Obama was referring to Americans generally, telling a South Carolina audience on Tuesday that the president ''said that Americans are lazy. I don't think that describes America.''
Mr. Perry, however, took things one step further on Wednesday night during an interview on Fox News. A Fox host, Sean Hannity, showed the new ad and asked the governor, ''What does it reveal to you about his mind-set and his thinking?''
Speaking about Mr. Obama, Mr. Perry replied: ''It reveals to me that he grew up in a privileged way. You know, he never had to really work for anything. He never had to go through what Americans are going through.''
Mr. Obama, whose background could be considered no better off than middle class, was raised partly by a single mother who at times, he has said, was on food stamps. He also achieved the pinnacle of legal education, winning election as president of the Harvard Law Review.
The attacks on Mr. Obama come as Mr. Perry enters a more aggressive phase of his campaign in terms of ad strategy. Up to now, his ads have mainly focused on biographical themes with positive messages. But with the Iowa caucuses less than seven weeks away, the campaign is shifting to a more pointed tone.
A spokesman for Governor Perry did not respond to a message seeking comment.

HEADLINE: European Rift On Bank's Role In Debt Relief

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and NICHOLAS KULISH; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin. Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels, and Raphael Minder from Madrid.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The financial stability of Europe has come down to one institution, the European Central Bank, which is now under heavy new pressure to rescue the euro -- or possibly see it collapse.
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain's prime minister, on Thursday became the latest leader to demand that the bank find a solution to the euro crisis, saying that ''this is what we transferred power for'' and that it had to be a bank ''that defends the common policy and its countries.''
Mr. Zapatero made his unusually blunt statements on a day when markets sagged further and contagion continued its seemingly inexorable spread from the small economies on Europe's periphery to Italy, Spain and even France at the core. Spain was forced Thursday to pay nearly 7 percent on an issue of 10-year debt, the highest since 1997, while investors demanded the largest premium for buying French as opposed to German debt in the decade-long history of the euro.
Only the fiercely conservative stewards of the European Central Bank have the firepower to intervene aggressively in the markets with essentially unlimited resources. But the bank itself, and its most important member state, Germany, have steadfastly resisted letting it take up the mantle of lender of last resort. 
European politicians and analysts say that unbending stance now threatens the survival of the euro and the broader integration of Europe itself.
''There is no solution to the crisis without the E.C.B.,'' said Charles Wyplosz, a professor at the Graduate Institute in Geneva and co-author of a standard textbook on European integration. ''The amounts we are talking about are too big for anybody but the E.C.B.''
At issue is whether the bank has the will -- or the legal foundation -- to become a European version of the Federal Reserve in the United States, with a license to print money in whatever quantity it considers necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of markets and, if needed, to essentially bail out countries that are members of the euro zone.
Traditionally, and according to its charter, the European bank has viewed its role in much narrower terms, as a guardian of the value of the euro with a mission to prevent inflation. But as market unease has spread over the past two years, critics say the bank's obsession with what they say is a phantom threat of inflation has stifled growth and helped bring the euro zone to the edge of a financial precipice.
With events threatening to spin out of control, the burden now rests on Mario Draghi, an inflation fighter in the president's job at the bank barely two weeks who surprised many economists by immediately cutting interest rates a quarter point.
''Everything until now is just a prelude. This is where it gets serious,'' said Peter Zeihan, vice president of analysis at Stratfor, a geopolitical research center. ''This is not purely economics. This is about Germany's position in Europe and whether they control the institutions or not.''
Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France held a conference call on Thursday with Italy's newly sworn-in prime minister, Mario Monti, to discuss how Italy could win back the confidence of markets, Mrs. Merkel's office said in a statement. German policy makers believe the crisis is serving a purpose, keeping pressure on free-spending governments and forcing them to reform. Any rescue by the European Central Bank, they say, would only delay the inevitable reckoning.
Unlike the Federal Reserve, which has a mandate to promote employment as well as to fight inflation, the European Central Bank is charged first and foremost with maintaining price stability. In addition, the bank is specifically prohibited from financing the governments of euro area members.
So far, the bank's bond interventions have been modest by central bank standards -- $252 billion so far, compared with more than $2 trillion purchased by the Federal Reserve in recent years. The European bank does not disclose details of its purchases, but it has been active lately, and traders said it bought Spanish and Italian bonds on Thursday in small amounts, Reuters reported.
In theory, the bank's ability to buy bonds is unlimited because it can print money. There would certainly be legal complaints about its violating its charter, but legal experts say those are questionable, and in any event the euro crisis will be decided long before the cases are adjudicated.
The political constraints, however, remain formidable, and as always Germany plays the pivotal role. While wielding only 2 of the 23 votes on the bank's governing council, Germany is the biggest contributor to its capital, and Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, is the biggest institution in the network of central banks that conduct most of the European bank's business, including market intervention.
The bank's focus on price stability was transplanted from the Bundesbank, where the aversion to inflation is virtually genetic. In German eyes, there is a de facto promise that the bank will never turn loose the printing presses to bail out overindebted nations.
That path ''belongs to the deadly sins of a central bank,'' Wolfgang Franz, chairman of the German Council of Economic Experts, an official panel that advises the government, said in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.
Many economists say there is little risk of inflation in the sagging European economy, but any large-scale intervention would create a political uproar. The bank could move quickly, said Richard Portes, professor of economics at the London Business School, but ''it needs political cover to do what it needs to do.''
It is not clear where that will come from. In a speech in Berlin on Thursday, Mrs. Merkel cautioned, ''If politicians believe the E.C.B. can solve the problem of the euro's weakness, then they're trying to convince themselves of something that won't happen.''
Germany has reason to be cautious. In the event that Italian, Spanish and other bonds had to be written down the way that Greek bonds were, Berlin would have to pay the most to recapitalize the bank. That would be tantamount to a backdoor bailout, a transfer of money from German taxpayers to cover the debts of other states without parliamentary approval.
''New Yorkers don't mind transferring money year after year to Appalachia, but in Europe, people do mind,'' said Dennis J. Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. ''Populism would rise, the European project would truly be in danger because the democratic deficit would explode.''
Much discussion has centered on whether Greece might leave or be forced to leave the euro zone, but the Germans might question whether they should stay if all their most cherished principles are violated.
''The Germans are pushing to amend the treaties right now so a country could leave the euro zone,'' said Mr. Zeihan of Stratfor. ''In the end, Germany might leave.''

HEADLINE: Mayor's Next Big Test: Negotiations With Labor

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS; Hunter Clauss contributed reporting.. 
dmihalopoulos@chicagonews coop.org

 BODY:
After Mayor Rahm Emanuel's highly public five-week push to win City Council approval for his first annual budget, the next phase of the mayor's efforts to restore Chicago's fiscal health will take place mostly behind closed doors.
Wrangling unanimous support for his $6.3 billion budget from 50 aldermen on Wednesday could prove to have been simpler than Mr. Emanuel's negotiations with labor representatives for police officers, firefighters and white-collar city workers whose contracts expire in seven and a half months. 
This next stage could be just as crucial as the budget vote to the mayor's stated goal of bringing City Hall's spending in line with its means, because 85 percent of day-to-day operating expenses involve rising wages, benefits and other personnel costs.
Although the ranks of city workers have thinned significantly in recent years, paying them has become increasingly expensive, in large part because of contracts signed under Mayor Richard M. Daley, who granted higher wages and also saw a significant spike in health benefit expenses. City records show that employee pay increased to an average of $75,000 a year in 2010, from $64,000 in 2003, while benefit costs jumped 37 percent.
Mr. Emanuel said this week that he hoped to cut those expenses, referring to ''hidden costs in our contracts that are burdening our taxpayers.''
The newly approved budget ''doesn't solve everything,'' he said. ''We have issues of the pensions to deal with. We have issues of contracts to deal with, since labor costs are such a big part of the budget.''
The contracts for police officers and firefighters, whose wages account for 77 percent of the city's employee-pay costs, expire June 30, 2012.
Michael Shields, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7, said discussions about a new contract for his members were in the early stages. The city's more than 10,000 sworn police officers received a 10 percent raise since 2007 under their current five-year deal.
''I think Chicagoans appreciate officers and believe they deserve a better raise'' in their next contract with the city, Mr. Shields said.
The collective-bargaining agreement with the union representing administrative staff members, who will bear the brunt of Mr. Emanuel's 2012 layoffs, also ends in the middle of next year.
In 2007, Mr. Daley forged 10-year contracts with labor groups representing about 7,300 blue-collar workers. But clauses in those deals could give Mr. Emanuel the ability to try to end those agreements as early as next year.
The mayor's combination of spending cuts and ''revenue enhancements'' -- increases in taxes, fees and fines -- are intended to bridge a budget deficit next year of almost $636 million. Without such changes, and with only modest growth in economically sensitive revenues, Mr. Emanuel's aides projected that the deficit would have mushroomed to at least $741.4 million in 2013 and to almost $800 million the following year.
If fully enforced, the budget measures in the mayor's 2012 fiscal plan would greatly, but far from entirely, erase those future deficits, said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a business-financed tax watchdog group. The shortfalls still could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
''We think he has probably reduced two-thirds of the structural deficit,'' Mr. Msall said.
The projected deficit figures did not include the costs of making up for the city's failure to adequately finance employee pensions. Mr. Emanuel's 2012 budget devotes about $500 million to pensions, although catching up on pension obligations would require the city to contribute $1.2 billion a year.
On Wednesday, Mr. Emanuel said he supported efforts in the state legislature to overhaul the pension system. The proposals have so far failed to win enough support in Springfield.
During his campaign for mayor, Mr. Emanuel told union leaders that he favored cutting pensions for current employees as well as new hires. Waiting for a general economic revival to solve the city's woes is not an option, Mr. Msall said.
''Even a significant economic recovery, where the economy rebounds briskly in six to nine months, would be unlikely to generate revenues equal to the built-in increases in the cost of city government,'' he said.

HEADLINE: New Face in Texas With a Familiar Story

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
RICHLAND HILLS, Tex. -- The National Review cover proclaimed him ''the great conservative hope.'' George Will declared him ''as good as it gets.'' Influential conservatives endorsed him and gave him speaking slots alongside presidential candidates at national gatherings, where the crowds rewarded him with standing ovations.
Two years ago, all this attention went to Marco Rubio of Florida, a little-known conservative challenger who transformed grass-roots anti-incumbent fever, a powerful personal story and populist oratory into a victory that upended an establishment Republican running for the United States Senate.
This year, the attention is going to another Cuban-American, Ted Cruz, who is trying to stage a similar upset in the Republican primary for the Senate race in Texas. 
A true believer's true believer -- as a teenager, he earned scholarship money delivering speeches on Friedrich Hayek -- Mr. Cruz has become the darling of conservative leaders looking to reinforce the rightward shift of the Republican Party. The primary, in March, will test whether the Tea Party energy that helped elect so many conservatives in 2010 still packs punch enough to overcome the establishment advantages of money and name recognition.
At 40 (his campaign aides note that he is just six months older than Mr. Rubio), Mr. Cruz wants to be part of a new generation of leaders to fill what he calls ''the weeping, screaming void of effective free-market champions.''
''I ask people: How many people inspire you? How many people are effectively making the case?'' he said in an interview here. ''If you really believe that we're fighting to save our country, how many people are effectively making the argument?''
''What I think is at stake in 2012,'' he said, ''is whether the five or six strong conservatives elected to the Senate in 2010 become 10 or 12. And if that happens, it will fundamentally shift the character of the Senate. It will shift the balance.''
In more than a year campaigning, Mr. Cruz has become a fixture at Tea Party events. So has his father, Rafael, whose story forms the emotional core of Mr. Cruz's pitch to voters.
As a teenager, Mr. Cruz's father fought with the rebels against the Batista government in Cuba, and was captured and tortured, before fleeing to the United States in 1957. He arrived in Austin at 18 with little English and $100 sewn into his underwear. He washed dishes for 50 cents an hour to work his way through the University of Texas, then started a business in Houston.
''When I was a kid, my father would always say, 'When we faced oppression in Cuba, I had a place to flee to. If we lose our freedom here, where do we go?' '' Mr. Cruz tells audiences. ''There's no question that better explains why I am running for Senate.''
Mr. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, where his parents were working in the oil business. Back in Houston for high school, he entered speech contests run by the Free Enterprise Institute. Students learned the ''Ten Pillars of Economic Wisdom,'' a government-out-of-the-economy manifesto based on the work of libertarian thinkers like Mr. Hayek, Frederic Bastiat, Ludwig von Mises and Milton Friedman, then wrote and memorized 20-minute speeches about it. As one of the citywide winners for four years, Mr. Cruz traveled the state, speaking to civic groups for $50 or $100 a speech.
The institute then chose him to be one of its ''Constitutional Collaborators,'' who spent hundreds of hours debating the Constitution. Using a mnemonic device to memorize it, they toured the state, writing it out for audiences.
It made Mr. Cruz an early adopter of the worldview that now characterizes Tea Party politics, where federal involvement in health care or the economy (and many of the roles it has assumed since the New Deal) is socialism and an abuse of the Constitution. At Princeton, he wrote his thesis on the Ninth and 10th Amendments, the core of the states' rights argument.
It also directed him toward politics. He graduated from Harvard Law School, then clerked for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and served in the Bush administration at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.
In 2003 he was named solicitor general in Texas, and in five years wrote 70 briefs to the Supreme Court and argued before it nine times, winning cases that defended, among other things, the state's right to have a monument to the Ten Commandments at the Capitol, the Pledge of Allegiance (after it was struck down for including ''under God''), and the sovereignty of the United States against a judgment from the International Court of Justice.
He has run a largely national campaign, seeking out and receiving endorsements from groups like FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth, as well as from conservative senators -- Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Jim DeMint of South Carolina -- and the radio host Mark Levin.
Introduced at the Values Voters Summit in Washington last month, Mr. Cruz was praised as a candidate with the intellectual skills of Mr. Lee -- who also ousted an establishment Republican last year in Utah -- and the story of Mr. Rubio.
He strode the stage of the cavernous ballroom as he spoke, without notes, likening 2012 to the dawning of the Reagan era in 1980. ''The most enduring legacy of President Barack Obama is going to be a new generation of leaders standing up for liberty,'' he declared.
As he recounted his fights as solicitor general (''We defended United States sovereignty!'') the crowd jumped to its feet several times. He began a call-and-response: Can we retake the United States Senate? Can we repeal Obamacare? Can we defeat President Obama? The crowd was on its feet again: ''Yes we can!''
The favorite in the Texas race (an open seat, to replace Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison) is David Dewhurst, who has wide name recognition as lieutenant governor, and a personal fortune from his own energy and investment company to spend on his campaign.
Mr. Dewhurst has irritated conservatives for his record on immigration and budgets -- he once proposed a wage tax to pay for education, which critics saw as another word for income tax in a state that has none.
Mr. Cruz tweaks him for missing candidate forums (a Cruz campaign aide in a duck costume has attended in Mr. Dewhurst's absence, holding a sign advertising a Web site, DuckingDewhurst.com) and has challenged him to a Lincoln-Douglas-style series of debates.
As Mr. Rubio did, Mr. Cruz has racked up victories at straw polls across the state -- victories that mean little but can chip away at the sense of inevitability around a front-runner.
But even Mr. Cruz acknowledges that Mr. Dewhurst has not been as ''foolish'' as the opponent Mr. Rubio faced in Florida, Charlie Crist, who was haunted by a picture of himself hugging President Obama at an event to support the economic stimulus bill, the spark to the Tea Party's fire.
Mr. Dewhurst's aides say that unlike Mr. Rubio, Mr. Cruz has been unable to translate the national attention into big increases in fund-raising and polls. While Mr. Cruz has raised $2.8 million to Mr. Dewhurst's $2.64 million, Mr. Dewhurst has been in the race only since July. And 30 percent of Mr. Cruz's contributions, they note, come from out of state.
''He's running a campaign outside of Texas,'' said Matt Hirsch, a Dewhurst spokesman, referring to Mr. Cruz. ''David is running this campaign to talk about the issues voters of Texas care about.''
Mr. Cruz's campaign, in turn, notes that Mr. Dewhurst's support dropped slightly in a Texas Tribune poll after he entered the race, and that it should be higher than it was -- 22 percent -- given that he holds statewide office.
With more than half dozen candidates in the race, Mr. Cruz's supporters hope he can deny Mr. Dewhurst a majority of the vote, forcing a runoff.
At a candidate forum here in suburban Fort Worth, the other candidates also needled Mr. Cruz's national focus.
''I'm not endorsed by a bunch of people who don't live in Texas and don't understand Texas,'' said Elizabeth Ames Jones, the state's railroad commissioner (who later dropped out of the race).
But for many voters in the crowd, the national attention is enough to win theirs.
Bob May, 70, said he had been eyeing another candidate -- Tom Leppert, the former mayor of Dallas. ''But I have to go with what Jim DeMint says,'' he said. ''Things like Obamacare wouldn't get passed if we had more conservatives in the Senate. We need more conservatives in the Senate.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 2, 2011

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 18 about Ted Cruz, who is seeking the Republican nomination for United States Senate in Texas, gave outdated information about the candidates in the primary. Elizabeth Ames Jones, the state's railroad commissioner, who was quoted speaking at a candidates' forum in mid-October, is no longer seeking the seat. (She withdrew from the race on Nov. 7.)

HEADLINE: Tackling Income Inequality

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: Raising tax rates on the wealthiest people, on capital gains and on dividends, while cutting corporate tax rates, would help the American economy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The Occupy Wall Street protesters have focused attention on rising income inequality in the United States, and they are right to do so. 
Income and wealth disparities have reached levels not seen in the United States since the Roaring Twenties. And the concentration of income and wealth contributed to the speculative excesses that brought on the 2008 financial crisis (see Robert Reich's "Aftershock" and Raghuram Rajan's "Fault Lines").
According to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office, rising income inequality is a long-term trend that began in the late 1970s and strengthened during the last two decades. The report confirms the protesters' belief that the rising gap between the income of the top 1 percent and the income of everyone else is a major factor behind escalating inequality. 
In the last 20 years, inequality has been largely a story of a small elite - not just the top 1 percent, but the top 0.1 percent - pulling away from everyone else in every source of household income: labor income, capital income and business income.

The top 1 percent's share of national income has also been rising in most other advanced industrial countries, but it is by far the largest and has grown the most in the United States (see Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson's "Winner-Take-All Politics"). 
Why have incomes of those in the top 1 percent soared? Their occupations provide some clues. From 1979 to 2005, nonfinancial executives, managers and supervisors accounted for 31 percent of the top 1 percent, medical professionals for 16 percent, financial professionals for 14 percent and lawyers for 8 percent. 
Together, executives, managers, supervisors and financial professionals accounted for 60 percent of the increase in the top 1 percent's income, with a widening compensation differential between those in the financial sector and those in other sectors of the economy after 1990. 
Superstar athletes, actors and musicians, often portrayed among the super-rich, accounted for about 3 percent of the top 1 percent from 1979 to 2005, far less than the less glamorous people (mostly men) who lead and advise America's businesses. 
Researchers have identified several reasons for the rapid growth in incomes for the occupations that make up most of the top 1 percent, including "winner take all" technical innovations that have changed the labor market for superstars in all fields; increases in business size and complexity; a growing premium for highly specialized skills; changes in the forms of executive compensation, including the rise of stock options and weaknesses in corporate governance; and the increasing size of the financial sector. 
All of these factors have played a role, but there is no definitive evidence on their relative significance.
Growing inequality in labor compensation played a major role in increasing income inequality between the top 1 percent and the rest of the population from 1979 to 2007. Over the period, however, both the growing inequality in business income, including income from small firms, partnerships and S corporations, and in capital income in the form of dividends, interest and capital gains, as well as the rising share of these forms of income in household income, played a more significant role, especially after 2000. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, from 2002 to 2007 more than four-fifths of the increase in income inequality was the result of an increase in the share of household income from capital gains, with the remainder the result of an increase in other forms of capital income. 
Capital and business income are much more unevenly distributed than labor income and have become more so over time. Capital gains income is the most unevenly distributed -- and volatile -- source of household income. 
The top 0.1 percent earns about half of all capital gains, and such gains account for about 60 percent of the income of the top 400 taxpayers. 
Large cuts in federal tax rates on capital and business income have been very beneficial to the top 1 percent over time. In 1978, a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president reduced the top tax rate on most long-term capital gains to 28 percent from about 35 percent. It was reduced again to 20 percent in 1981 and then raised back to 28 percent in 1987, where it remained for a decade. 
While serving as President Clinton's national economic adviser, I led a study by his economic team of the likely effects of reducing the rate. We concluded that a cut would decrease future tax revenue, would contribute to rising inequality and would not increase saving and investment as its advocates asserted. Despite these warnings, in 1997 the president agreed to cut the rate to 20 percent, as part ofa budget compromise with the Republican Congress. 
Then, with Democratic support, President Bush reduced the tax rate on capital gains and other forms of capital income to a record low of 15 percent in 2003. Under the "carried interest" provisions of United States tax law, this rate also applied to fees earned by hedge fund and private equity managers, a rapidly rising cohort within the top 1 percent.
As a result of these changes, along with President Bush's across-the-board cuts in income tax rates, federal taxes as a share of household income fell for the top 1 percent. Over all, the Bush tax cuts were the largest -- not only in dollar terms but also as a percentage of income -- for high-income households and increased the concentration of after-tax income at the top. Far from curbing escalating inequality, the Bush tax cuts exacerbated the problem. 
While the federal tax code is still progressive, its progressivity has eroded, with a significant percentage of the richest now paying a much lower tax rate than the merely rich and the middle class. (Warren E. Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary because most of her income comes in the form of wages that are subject to both federal income tax and the payroll tax while most of his income comes in the form of capital gains and dividends that are taxed at 15 percent and that are not subject to the payroll tax.)
A credible plan to reduce the long-run deficit requires a significant increase in revenue. Polls indicate that the majority of Americans, like the Wall Street protesters, believe that higher taxes on the rich are warranted both to reduce the deficit and to contain mounting inequality. I agree. 
Restoring the top income tax rates and capital gains and dividends tax rates to their levels under President Clinton, as President Obama has repeatedly proposed, would be useful first steps. Taxing some carried interest as ordinary income would make the tax system more efficient and curtail outsize compensation in the financial sector. Adding a progressive consumption tax would augment revenue while encouraging saving and discouraging spending on luxury goods, both by the very rich and by those down the income ladder struggling to keep up. 
The majority of Americans, like the Wall Street protesters, also believe the corporate tax rate should be raised. I disagree. 
For reasons I discussed in an earlier Economix post, I believe that this rate should be reduced - a position advocated by both President Obama and former President Clinton in his new book. Raising tax rates on capital gains and dividends to the levels under President Clinton would curb the growth of income for the top 1 percent and could finance a substantial cut in the corporate tax rate that would bolster wages and job opportunities for American workers.

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. Meet Mac Cato. 

 BODY:
 Sometimes a look back is the best way to look ahead. I now view the future, at least on the good days, with some acceptance. Doris Day was right. What will be, will be. But I have learned to think back on my seven plus decades as one long obstacle-filled race. Over the years I stumbled over many hurdles but always got up and rejoined the race. Not without some serious bruising to my ego, of course. Then, after a long 50 year career as a creative warrior in clients' branding wars, I decided to stop and write about what I learned. The first book was my goal was help younger warriors prepare for the inevitable high hurdles that lay ahead. Of course re-weaving my memories gave me a fresh perspective too.
 Although the global misery and forebodings of the 1930's didn't enter into my personal recollections as a child, I believe, as do you, that lots of things get absorbed into our subconscious before we reach the age of six. (This decade of terrible financial times, political chaos and the shadow of war was more than half over before I came along.) In Edgewood, a sleepy suburb of Indianapolis, all seemed serene in the fall of 1941- until December 7th. I was listening to the Gene Autry show when a man broke in to tell us that the Japanese had attacked "us" at Pearl Harbor. As I wrote elsewhere, this sounded pretty scary to a little kid. Where is Pearl Harbor? Who are the Japanese? Will they be bombing our house?
 I was introduced to the heroism and tragedies of WWII via newspaper headlines, newsreels, radio and - not the least of the influences - comic books, which we kids talked about and traded like a version of today's twittering. Living, albeit safely, through such a cataclysmic period sparked a sense of history that has never left me. My school days in the 40's and 50s started in a vague kind of suspenseful worry about how things were going to turn out, interrupted by a brief euphoria of peace in 1945, one that was quickly dampened by the Cold War, Korea, and the continuation of a global obstacle race that is still being contested.
When I graduated from high school in 1953, the US was in a pretty good space. We did like 'Ike' and as I went off at 17 to the Design and Architecture program at the University of Cincinnati, I was ready for new challenges. Similar to stories in A Social Animal, a much more multifaceted life then opened up for me. The design studies were important but achieving broader horizons was a direct result of my course in history, world literature, and the history of art. I was always a reader and the improved cultural foundation gleaned from formal studies just whetted my appetite for more.
 Was this a 'golden age' for my generation? Well, 1958 was not a bad time to enter the real world; in most urban areas a high school education could land you a decent job, a university experience was open to almost anyone who wanted one badly enough, even those still cheated by racial and economic barriers. I started work at a small creative shop in Cincinnati Ohio where, after seven years experience, I was destined to move to London and expand our offer into international offices. (A combination of ambition, energy and naivety as to the odds against was the key to success).
Globally, during these years, we all lived in apprehension about what a nuclear-armed Soviet Russia, and its captive Communist bloc, would do next. China was cut off in a separate, hostile world, Europe endured failed revolutions in Communist countries; but Europe did manage to create a Common Market intended to bind old enemies together economically. In the 60's and 70's, living in London, a new world of experiences was welcomed personally and professionally. My young son had the benefit of attending excellent English schools but jealously guarded his American roots. During this period my wife and I were in no hurry to return to the US, especially as the Vietnam era was wrecking its havoc everywhere. Instead we traveled everywhere and soaked it all up. So was this the best golden era for me?
Yes and no. My ambitions led to a decision in the mid seventies to merge (sell!) Cato Johnson to a global agency, Young & Rubican, in order to grow and expand further. The resulting growth was as hoped - but I soon understood that life was still an obstacle course. After a couple of years Y&R asked me to return to the US and look after the Cato Johnson's professional product from NY.; which of course meant that I left behind the network of friends and loyal associates built over more than a decade living in Europe.
In 1983 the inevitable happened. As an entrepreneur in spirit and habit, I knew I needed to leave what was no longer 'my' company; this was a very big emotional hurdle - and while over ensuing years I enjoyed helping to build new enterprises, I mourned the loss of the original for a long time. So the golden age was tarnished in memory - but there were some lessons learned.
Cato Gobe was where I began to grope at understanding what lay beneath in the subconscious. We developed a brand development process that combined the skills of art and science. Intuitively knowing that all of us, as consumers and citizens, have hidden emotional, visual vocabularies, out task was to systematically isolate the personal values a designated audience was most likely to honor; then proceed to create sets of 'Ideas they could see', based on graphic cues and codes. There were no published neuroscience findings to support our conclusions then - but the illogical logic that emotions drive people's decisions helped build consensus between marketers and creatives about consumer buying decisions - and led to innovative consumer research techniques.
 Hooked on the allure of uncovering what lies beneath in our subconscious, I followed the S.E.N.S.E.* siren song in my consulting career until the urge to write about its power took over. Sadly, during this period my original marriage broke down. As I absorbed more about how our unconscious can lead us to personal decisions that don't stand the test of time; the family dynamics based on a younger self no longer worked.
The new century. Remarried for twenty years and back again in London, I have succumbed to the 'Give Something Back' virus, the educational stimulus for Go Logo! Now, in collaboration with Kunal Sinha, based in Shanghai as Olgivy&Mather's Director of Cultural Insights for China, we are working toward launching a programme of a new book, website, and blog platform. As China moves forward on its own obstacle filled course, we believe helping China's young brand warriors to be better prepared to compete and create the kind of new products that will sustain consumer oriented growth for years to come is a worthy undertaking. And very exciting.
So here's my self-conscious scorecard.
Career, an A- ; All in all, satisfying and productive. The bumps were painful but instructive.
Family, a B- ;The sorrow of an initial marriage failure but the happiness of a successful 2nd chance. Two great adult sons with families of their own. Great pride and love for them.
Faith, a B; No allegiance to a formal religion - but a sometimes faltering belief that there is still hope for a more harmonious society.
Community, a B ; in a global, national sense, a source of considerable angst. The two books and occasional teaching gigs are my contribution to community. Plus allegiance to those few politicians who seem to get it.
Self knowledge, a B; still working on it! *(Sensory Exploration/Need State Evaluation)

HEADLINE: Wasting Medicare Money?

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Why will Medicare pay for an expensive treatment for breast cancer that the F.D.A. has found to pose risks with no proven benefit? 

 BODY:
Here's a clever idea for how to save Medicare some cash without hurting patients. Don't pay for treatments found to be useless.
The Food and Drug Administration today revoked the approval of the drug Avastin as a treatment for breast cancer, saying, according to the Times article, that "the drug was not helping breast cancer patients to live longer or control their tumors, but did expose them to potentially serious side effects such as severe high blood pressure and hemorrhaging."
The drug remains on the market for other uses, meaning doctors can prescribe it if they wish to do so. The article states it is most likely that private insurers will refuse to cover the $88,000 cost of the drug, but that "Medicare, however, has said it would continue to pay for the drug's use in breast cancer."
How can that be?

The article explains: 
Medicare is obligated to pay for off-label use of cancer drugs that are listed in references known as compendia, such as the one published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an organization of major cancer hospitals. 
In July, shortly after the F.D.A. advisory committee voted to revoke the approval, a committee of breast cancer specialists assembled by the cancer network reaffirmed that Avastin should remain listed as "an appropriate therapeutic option for metastatic breast cancer."
So a committee that includes doctors who may stand to profit from getting the government to pay for useless medicines -- or even have ties to the drug maker -- can get to overrule the F.D.A. on how to spend scarce taxpayer money.
Can anyone explain why there should a law requiring that Medicare to pay for off-label uses, other than by referring to the lobbying power of pharmaceutical companies such as Genentech, which makes Avastin?

HEADLINE: Can the U.S. and Australia Slake China's Coal Thirst and Still Claim CO2 Progress?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Fast-growing exports of coal from rich countries to China show the limits of domestic greenhouse-gas policy. 

 BODY:
I often try to step back and take the point of view of the atmosphere in considering claims of progress on curbing emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities. It's a sobering practice, but helpful if your goal is to chart what will, and won't, make a big difference in limiting warming as human numbers and resource appetites crest in coming decades.
I conducted this exercise a few days ago. In reading a fresh assessment by Eric de Place of planned American coal exports to China (noted via Climateprogress), I was reminded of a batch of reporting I did recently on Australia's new carbon plan in light of its vast coal exports (300 million tons a year now, nearly all to Asia) and plans for substantial growth (5 percent a year through 2020).
It was jarring to see the country's current leadership and climate campaigners hail Australian adoption of a domestic carbon tax and cap, given the vast carbon leakage.
Below you can read some of the input I received on Australia's booming exports of coal (and carbon dioxide emissions) and how they relate to the challenge of stabilizing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere some time this century. As was explored here before, one question is, "When coal flows between countries, who 'owns' the CO2?"
It is findings like these that cause me to take a different stance on climate progress than Joe Romm, who demands that anyone seriously engaged in assessing climate policy pick a number -- either for a safe target for stabilization of carbon dioxide concentrations or temperature rise.
To me, choosing a number -- 350, 450 or 550 parts per million, 2 or 3 degrees (F. or C.!) -- is essentially meaningless for our generation, especially given the trajectories for emissions in China and India.
The task on emissions is twofold -- to bend the curve of gas releases using regulations, incentives, education and standards, but (more importantly, to me) also to build the intellectual infrastructure and innovative, globally-collaborative culture that will be required for the next generation to take that curve down toward zero even as humanity's energy needs continue to rise. My emphasis on the second component derives from all the biases toward the quick fix that are built into the human brain, political institutions and culture.
I'll be filing a related batch of new input next week on California's greenhouse-gas emissions plan, which I hope will help convey why advancing today's cleaner energy technologies and practices and boosting basic science and inquiry are essential to building an energy menu that works for the long haul. Click here for a foretaste from Nate Lewis of Caltech (video), who heads the Energy Department "innovation hub" on artificial photosynthesis.
Here's the Australian exchange, which is deeply relevant to discussions of next steps within the borders of the United States: 
The first step was a missive from me to a batch of energy and climate analysts who've done work on Australia's policies (some e-mail shorthand has been cleaned up in the following exchange):
Following up on my earlier piece pondering Australia's carbon plan.
Over and over, in considering the press about Australia' 'pioneering' carbon law, i keep circling back to those unaffected coal exports (which I've written on before).
John Perkins, as far back as 2008, made the point sharply. I also stumbled on Guy Pearse's lecture on this (below) and find it hard to refute (of course there's selection bias by me because this was my concern from the get-go). In any case, in reading these arguments, I find it hard to believe that anyone who cares about GLOBAL greenhouse gas emissions /concentrations could cheer the law, and - if so - I'd have to ask why ?
Here's an excerpt from Pearse's lecture:
The first reply came from of the Crawford School of Economics and Government at Australian National University:
As I see it there is no real difference here between Australia's policy and the European Union's policy. The EU's carbon policy doesn't restrict Norway exporting its oil for example as far as I know. The UNFCCC framework sees every country working to abate its domestic emissions or maybe reducing emissions elsewhere to offset them but not dealing with exports of fossil fuels and how they are used elsewhere. The flip side is countries are expected to address the emissions generated in producing export goods even though those goods are used elsewhere. So Australia is doing its expected part. I can't see how that is bad though it isn't as radical as some people might like to see.
I replied:
As long as the fast-growing developing countries burning the coal are not stemming emissions (and I don't count on that any time soon), this -- to my mind -- reveals the hollow nature of the E.U. and Kyoto approach.
China is going gangbusters on renewables (in addition to coal) and on shifting to more efficient coal use (and continuing with nuclear and, of course, gas). But if anyone can point me to evidence that China plans to burn coal in the long run on the basis of greenhouse concerns, I'd be happy to highlight that.
David G. Victor of the University of California, San Diego, responded next:
I think there are three distinct issues.
First, although Australia has a large export industry it is hardly the only country in that situation. And lots of its emissions are nonetheless fixed to Australia. The carbon plan gets a start on that and it uses markets. And for those reasons I am a supporter. The plan doesn't treat exports the same, but that's more or less true for every country that gets serious about cutting emissions. Almost always there are special rules, opt-outs, emission credit allocations, or other provisions that lighten the blow on trade-exposed industries. That's not only essential politically it also makes sense economically. In a world where countries adopt different national emission control strategies one of the chief tasks of government is to manage those national programs at the "seams"--where they interact with the rest of the world economy.
Yes, Australia has big exports of carbon intensive fuels (it also has growing exports of carbon light fuels-gas as LNG), but that doesn't mean that there isn't an economically coherent, politically astute [policy] that starts with market signals within Australia. And that's more or less what the government has just adopted.
Second, the best plan would do something about carbon emissions regardless of where they come from, which is why a global strategy remains essential. Countries with big exports and a passion to do something about the climate change problem will be in the lead on that because they have the strongest interest to get things right. My guess is that if the Australian program sticks - it remains controversial, and others on this email can comment more about that - then Australia will be a leader in trying to get some coherent international strategy that includes China, the US and other big emitters. (How that could be done, the role of small "club" groups of countries instead of just relying on the UN Kyoto process, etc-those are all subjects I take up elsewhere in my book.)
Third, any national program must be designed with an eye for the private sector incentives to cut emissions not just at home but also overseas. I don't know how the Oz offsets program is designed, but I flag that this is one of the key elements to encouraging the stitching together of different national approaches into an international strategy. The offsets program is a flow of incentives; if tailored well it can reward good behavior in other countries and punish bad behavior. While I haven't worked on that in the Oz context, I have looked in some detail at the strategy for California (which faces many of the same challenges as Australia-a desire to move first yet the reality that some industries are exposed to trade) and published that with the Giannini foundation last year.
Roger A. Pielke, Jr., of the University of Colorado, weighed in:
The simple math of carbon dioxide emissions inevitably leads to the conclusion that if carbon dioxide concentrations are to be stabilized then the world will need to get 90%+ of its energy consumption from carbon-free sources. This value is independent of how much energy the world eventually needs, which I think we can safely say will be much more than what is consumed today.
Australia's carbon tax plan is flawed not because it ignores exports, it relies on dodgy offsets, makes promises that cannot be met or incorrectly suggests that pricing incentives will make a meaningful difference (though all of these things are the case).
Australia's plan is flawed because is offers no route to the
transformation of Australia's energy production -- thus, no route to 90%+ clean energy production. See, e.g.
The carbon tax -- if it is ever actually implemented or sustained -- is really just a sideshow and largely irrelevant to accelerating the decarbonization of Australia's economy. If you want to examine policies that might make a difference, have a look at the proposed Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Australia's broader industrial and innovation policies. That is where progress will come from. A well-designed carbon tax (which I think is essential to policies
focused on decarbonizing our economies) would provide financing to support such efforts.
There is a lot of debate over the Australian carbon tax and experts are willing to defend or criticize it, but I think that the route to more effective action actually lies elsewhere.

Stern then responded to my points about the hollow nature of the Kyoto Protocol and European approach and about China:
Sure, it [the leakage around domestic caps] could be seen as a failure of the current global approach but nothing specifically Australian.
It [action by China on greenhouse gases] was floated in discussions before the release of the current 5 year plan.
From what I hear the plan may be modified maybe even around the Durban meeting. At some point China knows it needs to peak and reduce emissions. Per capita emissions are already ahead of Sweden, Switzerland, etc.
Here is my blogpost about this
John L. Perkins of Australia's National Institute of Economic and Industry Research added:
I think Australia's carbon tax plan is actually flawed because it ignores exports, and it relies on dodgy offsets. The higher the carbon price gets, the more it will drive alternative energy. So it could be effective domestically, if it goes far enough.
As I have argued for some time, a tax on coal exports would be effective, it would send a global price signal, and given the elasticities, it would raise revenue from a lesser volume. If Australia could persuade Indonesia and South Africa to do likewise it would be viable. Given that Australia is by far the largest coal exporter, it should be up to Australia to arrange such a scheme. It would only need the agreement of a small number of countries, all of which would benefit. China will be relying more and more on imported coal.
Others are also starting to see the benefit of a tax-at-source plan. .
There is also another reason for such a plan. Exporters will be reaping monopoly rents due to depleting resource prices way in excess of production costs. OPEC oil revenues by 2030 will exceed $20 trillion. Australia will get a fair chunk for its coal. These financial imbalances will cause a lot of stress in deficit countries, which already have intractable debt issues.
I think we really need to be pushing the idea of global carbon/resource rent taxes. A rational soulution, but a hard sell. However if no one advocates it, it surely won't happen.
Guy Pearse, who is a research fellow at the Global Change Institute of the University of Queensland, reacted:
Thanks for copying me in, Andrew. Given my many other comments on the coal topic and on the recent "Clean Energy Future" package (e.g., here and here), I'm going to try resist the temptation to be a broken record here.
The one thing I must mention given the quote you've noticed in my August '11 speech is that my numbers in that were woefully conservative.
I have updated them after hearing the presentation by the new head of the Australian Coal Association at the recent Coaltrans Australia conference.... I think her figures are also an underestimate.... based on the numbers in ABARES' project pipeline and other projects that these sources don't yet fully include (e.g., Meijin's proposed 80mt ROM/60mt 'China Stone' export project in the Galilee Basin or all of the 84mt now expected from GVK/Hancock). Factor these in and Australia may well treble rather than double its coal exports by 2020. Factor in the "carbon light" CO2 from coal seam gas projects in the East (and other LNG expansion in the north and west) and you're talking about Australia's fossil fuel emission exports equating to TWO Saudi Arabias by 2020, not one as I've been saying to many disbelieving ears.
This would mean that by 2020 the 159mtpa CO2-e saved by the Gillard CEF (with heavy reliance on imported offsets, many of which I expect to be very dodgy for reasons I won't get started on here) would be erased more around 10 times over, not 4 times as I said in that speech you quoted.
Of course, industry, government, and others can offer lots of arguments why this expansion is an unstoppable force, not Australia's responsibility, and not so unique in the world. Most of these arguments are self-serving nonsense as I discussed in my August speech. It's perhaps also worth noting that that the pace of fossil fuel export emission growth in Australia is accelerating rather than contracting, in spite of a carbon tax and a resources tax.
To my mind, the elephant in Australia's room is not a topic with so much nuance, and nor in such a crucial decade for the climate is our plan to add another two elephants to the same room.
To add context from China, Roger Jones, professorial research fellow at the Center for Strategic Economic Studies of Victoria University, pointed the discussants to a recent analysis by Dr Jiang Kejun, of China's Energy Research Institute (ERI). It's well worth a look.
Frank Jotzo, the director of the Center for Climate Economics & Policy and deputy director of the Climate Change Institute at Australian National University, wrote:
Australia, like any other country, has the means to influence its domestic emissions using legislation, fiscal incentives and so forth. Those reductions translate directly reductions in global emissions. This is what Australia and other countries are expected to do as part of a global, if bottom-up climate change mitigation effort - and it is what Australia is now setting out to do, at a significant if far from overwhelming level.
But Australia, like other countries, does not have the power to directly influence policy settings in other countries. If China, India and others - and indeed Germany for that matter - build extra coal fired power stations then they will find the coal to supply them in international markets. You can make an argument that Australia should not export coal on moral or ethical grounds. I think many people would subscribe to that point of view, at least if the costs to their living standards are not to high. A society might decide to cut exports of a globally undesirable product for ethical reasons (though examples are few for any product I believe). However the practical effects on global emissions would be small.
The economic subtlety is about prices. If a country is a large enough player in coal export markets, then cutting back exports will increase prices for internationally traded coal, and hence give importers an incentive to use less. In the medium to longer term however, extra supply from other countries will tend to make up the shortfall. No single country dominates the world coal market. And so it seems to me that for coal exporters, the only way to raise prices significantly and permanently would be an agreement between the main coal exporters to restrain volumes and keep prices high - a kind of OPEC for coal. I make no judgement about the likelihood and political desirability of a formal arrangement between governments along these lines - though perhaps one could argue that global coal markets are not perfectly competitive anyway. A further issue of nuance is that over half of Australia's coal exports is for steelmaking (coking coal) where substitution options are limited, as opposed to steaming coal for power generation.
A word on the likely effectiveness of carbon pricing, in response to some of the other comments. A scenario of deep and fast de-carbonization will require carbon prices much higher than what is legislated in Australia or anywhere else, and/or drastic regulatory intervention. It could be achieved relying more on a (high) price, or more on (strong) specific interventions. The pricing route will give generally give more bang for buck. Ultimately the issue why people seem to be disappointed is not the choice of instrument, but the level of ambition. I agree that ambition in the Australian scheme - and any other country - falls short of what is necessary for strong global mitigation.
But you got to start somewhere. Australia is the highest per capita emitter, heavily reliant on coal and resources industries have very strong political influence. The fact that this country is putting a carbon price and complementary policies in place, at a level not below that of the EU, is remarkable and ought to be a sign of encouragement for other countries. It may be the first significant step towards ambitious mitigation in the longer term in Australia.
Guy Pearse reacted to Jotzo's take this way:
For various reasons discussed in that August speech it will come as no surprise that I don't share quite a few of Frank's assumptions - about it being fair enough for Australia to focus on domestic emissions; about us doing a pretty good job by world standards; about the integrity of the 'emission reductions' we plan to import; about Australia's place in the global coal trade; about the steel industry having few options; the idea that someone else will provide the coal anyway so there's little we can do about coal exports that will make a difference to global prices etc. There's no doubt that these are the views that resonate around the moribund echo chamber of Australian climate policy-making. It's just a shame that they are so rarely advanced in the company of evidence, and are most often used as excuses for ignoring the elephant in the room and squeezing in another two elephants over the next decade.
John Perkins closed out the discussion (for now):

HEADLINE: Sierra Club Leader Will Step Down

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: The departure of Carl Pope, who has led the Sierra Club for much of the last two decades, reflects a broader debate over how environmental groups can raise money, motivate activists and build public support for core concerns in an economic downturn. 

 BODY:
Carl Pope, who has led the Sierra Club for much of the last two decades, is planning to leave the organization next year as it struggles to redefine its mission in a tough economy, the organization said Friday.
 The move reflects a broader debate among many of the nation's environmental groups, which are finding it a challenge to raise money, motivate activists and build public support for core concerns like climate change in the face of high unemployment and hostility from Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail.
 Membership rolls at the Sierra Club, one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious environmental groups, have dropped sharply in the current economic downturn and the organization has undergone a sharp internal debate over priorities. Mr. Pope advocated partnerships with business and industry on a number of environmental projects, alienating some of group's older donors and activists.

 Mr. Pope, 66, stepped down as executive director last year after 17 years, turning the job over to Michael Brune, 40, who came to the Sierra Club from the Rainforest Action Network and Greenpeace, younger and politically more aggressive groups. Mr. Pope has held the title of chairman since Mr. Brune arrived and will remain a consultant to the club until the end of next year.
 Mr. Pope could not immediately be reached for comment.
His departure was first reported by The Los Angeles Times at its Web site on Friday.
 Mr. Brune said in an interview that he did not have major philosophical disagreements with Mr. Pope. Both believe that the group's central focus should be combating climate change and supporting alternative energy sources. Mr. Brune acknowledged that paid membership had declined by about 100,000 in recent years, to just more than 600,000, but attributed it to financial hardship caused by the recession.
 He said the Sierra Club had just approved the organization's largest annual budget ever, about $100 million for 2012, up from $88 million this year.
 Mr. Pope alienated some Sierra Club members by signing a four-year deal with Clorox to put the club's logo on a line of supposedly environmentally friendly products, bringing the organization $1.3 million but, in the eyes of many, sullying its image.
 Mr. Pope said in a statement released by the group that he would dedicate his time to working with business, labor, technology innovators and local government to strengthen American manufacturing. "To be competitive in the 21st century, a revitalized manufacturing sector must deploy clean energy, low-carbon fuels and sustainable technologies," he said.

Some who have been in Lower Manhattan since the start of Occupy Wall Street told reporters that the movement had become "more mature" over its two months and that it was no longer "inherently oppositional." [The Daily News]
Demonstrations in other cities led to traffic disruptions and closures of streets and bridges. In Portland, protesters were arrested for sitting on the roadway of the Steel Bridge after the police refused to allow them across. [NPR, The Oregonian]
Hundreds of protesters blocked a major intersection in the Los Angeles financial district. The police removed tents set up in the middle of a street and in a grassy area near a Bank of America, arresting more than 30 people. After the evacuation of Zuccotti Park in New York this week, officials in Los Angeles said theirs was the largest encampment, with more than 400 tents pitched in City Hall Park. The police said they were trying to work with protesters on an alternate location for the encampment. [LA Times, LAist]
Twenty-one people were arrested during protests in Las Vegas. Nevada leads the country in foreclosures (one in every 180 homes), underwater mortgages (60 percent of mortgaged homes) and unemployment (13.4 percent) but that doesn't stop Occupy Las Vegas from being one of the friendliest occupations. [Las Vegas Sun, LA Times] 
The "Walking Occupation" marching from New York to Washington, D.C., changed its route to avoid an overnight in Rising Sun, Md., where a branch of the K.K.K. was said to operate.

Protesters in Dallas were also evicted from their encampment near City Hall in the middle of the night. Eighteen people were arrested, according to city officials. [Reuters]
Protesters in Oakland used the day to "re-establish" their occupation following a second eviction from their encampment. Protesters in Philadelphia expressed frustration with their group's lack of focus after the city requested they leave their encampment. [New York Times]
In New York, on the march across the Brooklyn Bridge, protesters were buoyed by giant projections onto the Verizon building of pro-OWS and otherwise positive slogans. [Boing Boing]

 BODY:
Investigators Are Said to Zero In on Suspect Borrowing at MF Global | With $600 million in customer money still missing, investigators have discovered hundreds of millions of dollars in suspect borrowing at MF Global, people briefed on the investigation say.
Regulators suspect that the commodities and derivatives brokerage firm improperly diverted customers' cash for its own use in the days before its bankruptcy, these people said, and at least some of that money was used to cover trading losses, meaning the money may no longer be simply missing. It may be gone.
MF Global, like other brokers, can use customer cash if it puts up sufficient collateral. But the firm did not provide enough backing in late October, essentially taking free loans, said the people briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

HEADLINE: Natalie Wood's Death Is Being Reinvestigated, Los Angeles Authorities Say

BYLINE: MICHAEL CIEPLY


HIGHLIGHT: Almost exactly 30 years later, the County Sheriff's Department said it was reopening an inquiry into the death of the actress, who drowned in the waters off Santa Catalina Island. 

 BODY:
MONTEREY PARK, Calif. - The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said on Friday that it had reopened its investigation into the actress Natalie Wood's death 30 years ago because of new information from multiple sources.
"Recently, we received information which we felt was substantial enough" to reopen the case, Lt. John Corina of the Sheriff's Department said at a morning news conference here. 
Ms. Wood's death, on Nov. 29, 1981, in the waters off Santa Catalina Island, has persisted as a subject of Hollywood fascination. She had been staying on the yacht Splendour along with her husband, Robert Wagner, the actor Christopher Walken, and Dennis Davern, the boat's captain.
Lieutenant Corina said that Mr. Wagner was not a suspect.
Her death was ruled an accidental drowning, but has produced persistent speculation that was fed last year by a tell-all book, "Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour," written by Mr. Davern and a co-author, Marti Rulli.
In the book, the authors described fierce arguments among those on the boat. In a Friday morning appearance on the "Today" show, Mr. Davern said he had earlier lied to authorities about what happened on the Splendour, and had urged the sheriff to reopen the case. 
The sudden attention coincides with the approaching 30-year anniversary of Ms. Wood's death, and a planned re-examination of the case on the CBS true-crime show "48 Hours Mystery," which on Saturday is scheduled to broadcast an episode based in part on an article that was published by Vanity Fair in 2000.
The Los Angeles Times reported in its Friday editions that the case would be re-examined.
At Friday's news conference, Lieutenant Corina repeatedly told dozens of assembled reporters and media crew members that Ms. Wood's death had been ruled an accident, and would still be considered so unless the renewed investigation turned up contrary evidence.
He declined to describe what information had led the Sheriff's Department to reopen the case, or to say who had provided it.

He said investigators had not contacted Mr. Wagner about the renewed investigation, though, in response to a question, he said it would be standard procedure to tell Mr. Wagner, as Wood's survivor, that the case was open again. Asked whether Mr. Wagner was suspected of wrongdoing, Mr. Corina said, "No."
Alan Nierob, a spokesman for Mr. Wagner, said in a statement: "Although no one in the Wagner family has heard from the L.A. County Sheriff's Department about this matter, they fully support the efforts" to reach clarity about the death.
Lieutenant Corina declined to say whether Mr. Davern might face penalties for having earlier misled the authorities, but he said prosecution for impeding an investigation with false information was hypothetically possible. At one point, he said investigators planned to look again at the yacht, which is in Hawaii, but offered few other details in the course of the 10-minute appearance before the press.
At the time of her death, Ms. Wood, who was 43, was filming a movie, "Brainstorm," that co-starred Mr. Walken, and was seen as something of a comeback vehicle for an actress whose most noted performances had occurred years before.
Wood was three times nominated for acting Oscars, though she never won. Her last nomination, in 1964, was for her lead role in "Love With the Proper Stranger."
On the night of her death, she disappeared from the Splendour (one of her signature roles was in the film "Splendor in the Grass"), along with an inflatable boat. Her body was found some distance from where the Splendour was anchored, and the Los Angeles County coroner, Dr. Thomas T. Noguchi, said her injuries were consistent with drowning, perhaps after being hurt in a fall from the yacht.
An article on Saturday about the reopening of the investigation into the death of the actress Natalie Wood after 30 years referred imprecisely to the status of the movie she was making at the time. Though Ms. Wood had finished filming her scenes in the film, "Brainstorm," the movie itself was still in production; it had not been completed.

HEADLINE: Goldman's Cohn May Be Interviewed in Gupta Case

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Gary D. Cohn's name emerged during a court hearing as prosecutors and lawyers for Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, debated the timing of depositions that are set to be taken in a parallel S.E.C. case against Mr. Gupta. 

 BODY:
Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, is expected to be interviewed by the government in its insider trading case against Rajat K. Gupta, a former director of the bank.
Mr. Cohn's name emerged on Friday during a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan before Judge Jed S. Rakoff. 
Federal prosecutors and Mr. Gupta's lawyers debated the timing of depositions that are set to be taken in a parallel civil case being brought against Mr. Gupta by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The government has charged Mr. Gupta, who also served as a director of Procter & Gamble, with leaking secret board discussions to his friend Raj Rajaratnam, the former hedge fund manager who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month after his conviction on insider trading charges. A trial is scheduled for April 2012.
Mr. Cohn's connection to the case emerged during Mr. Rajaratnam's trial. Prosecutors presented evidence showing that Mr. Rajaratnam had a two-hour lunch in July 2008 with Mr. Cohn and David Loeb, a Goldman salesman. Mr. Loeb was also named as a potential witness during the hearing on Friday.
Prosecutors also played a recording of a July 25, 2008, call between Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Gupta that mentioned Mr. Cohn. During the discussion, Mr. Rajaratnam told Mr. Gupta that he had a lunch scheduled with Mr. Cohn later in the week and asked Mr. Gupta about a rumor that Goldman might look to buy a commercial bank.
"This was a big discussion at a board meeting," Mr. Gupta said to Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Gupta went on to explain on the call that Goldman was considering an acquisition of both Wachovia and the American International Group. 
Mr. Cohn is not the highest ranking Goldman official to play a role in the cases of Mr. Gupta and Mr. Rajaratnam. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the bank's chief executive, testified in March at Mr. Rajaratnam's trial about Mr. Gupta's role on the board and the secrets he had access to, including Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in the bank during the financial crisis.
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on Friday.
At the hearing, Judge Rakoff said he would release a more complete list of potential witnesses on Monday.
It also emerged at Friday's hearing that Mr. Gupta's legal team included Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton. Ms. White, a former United States attorney in Manhattan, is assisting Mr. Gupta's primary counsel, Gary P. Naftalis and a team of lawyers at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, in Mr. Gupta's defense.
As is common in Judge Rakoff's sessions, there were lighthearted moments. At one point, Mr. Naftalis mistakenly said he was representing Mr. Rajaratnam instead of Mr. Gupta, but quickly corrected himself. Still, Judge Rakoff seized upon the gaffe.
"I wouldn't send your bill to Mr. Rajaratnam, at least not these days," the judge said.

HEADLINE: Balanced Budget Amendment Falls Short in House

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans fail to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, as not enough Democrats go along to provide a two-thirds vote. 

 BODY:
The House failed Friday to approve a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, a central piece of the Republican fiscal agenda.
The vote was 261 to 165; it needed 290 votes, or two thirds of members, to pass.
The legislation that raised the debt ceiling and formed a joint committee to find $1.2 trillion in deficit savings required the House and the Senate to a vote on a balanced budget amendment.
While such an amendment was supported by 72 House Democrats a decade ago, only 25 Democrats voted in favor of the measure Friday; a mere four Republicans crossed party lines to oppose it.
Democrats like Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the party whip who once voted in favor of a balanced budget amendment, said the country's economic and political climate had changed too drastically to make the measure viable now.
"The fault, dear colleagues, is not in our Constitution," said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who spoke several times on the House floor against the measure. "It's in an irresponsible Republican president and an irresponsible Republican Congress. Many of those same Republican members, who saw nothing wrong with busting the budget, who sat quietly when Vice President Cheney said that deficits don't matter, now demand this assault on our founding document instead of delivering the votes for sound fiscal policy."
One high-profile Republican, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, rejected the measure at least in part because it was not as stringent as another version - one the House mulled but decided not to vote on -- that would have required a super-majority in Congress to raise taxes as a way of balancing the budget.
But most Republican expressed disappointment that the measure, which they deeply longed for, had not gotten a nod in the House. "Even though this amendment did not receive the super-majority needed for it to reach the Senate," said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican whip, "House Republicans will continue our efforts to restore fiscal sanity in Washington in our pursuit of a balanced budget."

WASHINGTON RESEARCH GROUP In its 37-year history, the Washington Research Group, which provides Wall Street clients with government policy analysis, has had a series of owners, including several who were involved in financial scandals, reported Peter Lattman of DealBook. The firm is in talks to be acquired by Guggenheim Partners.
Investment Banking
CORPORATE ACTIVISTS Long before Occupy Wall Street, the Sisters of St. Francis were quietly staging an occupation of their own, and have become one of the most surprising groups of corporate activists, reported Kevin Roose of DealBook.
CONSUMER FEES Facing a reaction from an angry public and heightened scrutiny from regulators, banks are turning to all sorts of fees that fly under the radar, reported Eric Dash of The New York Times.
BUFFETT WATCH Warren E. Buffett revealed on CNBC that his conglomerate had amassed 64 million shares of I.B.M., a stake of about 5.5 percent. Mr. Buffett disclosed the $10 billion-plus stake after a disclosure dispensation very few people get, reported Andrew Ross Sorkin.
GOLDMAN COST-CUTTING More than a dozen Goldman Sachs partners have announced plans to leave recently, a higher number than in years past, reported Susanne Craig of DealBook.
THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS Confronted by slumping profit and new capital requirements, Unicredit, the largest Italian bank, said that it would raise $10.3 billion and eliminate 5,200 jobs in Italy over the next few years. 
DEUTSCHE BANK BOARD Josef Ackermann unexpectedly canceled plans to assume the chairmanship of Deutsche Bank when he retires as chief executive in May, reported Jack Ewing of The New York Times. The decision possibly heralds his departure from the public stage after a decade as one of the most powerful and controversial figures in European banking.
UBS LEADERSHIP The Swiss bank has chosen Sergio P. Ermotti, who has run UBS on an interim basis since September, to become its permanent chief executive, reported Ms. Werdigier. On Thursday, Mr. Ermotti outlined his plan to run around the company. He "promised to shrink weak business units and to continue bolstering the bank's capital levels. He is also aiming to increase the firm's return on equity - a main measure of profitability - by several percentage points," Ms. Craig and Ms. Werdigier reported.
I.P.O./Offerings
DEAL PROFESSOR "So you want to be an Internet billionaire," asked Steven M. Davidoff. "It's not just about having a great idea and building a world-class business at light speed. A review of recent initial public offering filings for Internet start-ups shows that the founders ... avoided selling their precious equity early, before reaching the I.P.O. milestone."
Legal/Regulatory
TREASURY DEPT. For President Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has been the indispensable economic adviser who has outlasted every other member of the original inner circle, reported Jackie Calmes of The New York Times.
2012 ELECTION Mitt Romney's business career is a cornerstone of his campaign, reported Michael Barbaro of The New York Times. But his brand of capitalism had human costs and some messy financial consequences.
PONZI SCHEMES Federal authorities say they are cracking down on Ponzi schemes in greater numbers, Mr. Protess reported.
SECURITIES CLAIMS Citigroup and Deutsche Bank have agreed to pay a total of $165.5 million to settle federal regulators' claims that they had misled five failed credit unions about the risk of securities tied to mortgages. 
SINO-FOREST INQUIRY "A panel of directors of the Sino-Forest Corporation rejected claims of fraud at the Chinese company," reported Ian Austen of The New York Times. "But the document also makes clear that the panel was unable to verify some of the company data and statements at the heart of the case."
MF GLOBAL INQUIRY Nearly three weeks after $600 million in customer money went missing from MF Global, authorities were growing more suspicious about what went wrong. On Thursday, Azam Ahmed and Mr. Protess of DealBook reported that investigators say they believe customer funds were used in the broker's final days to cover trading losses.
MADOFF SCANDAL "A former trader at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities is expected to plead guilty on Monday to conspiring to defraud firm customers beginning in the early 1970s, two decades earlier than Mr. Madoff claims to have started his Ponzi scheme," reported Mr. Lattman and Diana B. Henriques of The New York Times. 
THE TRADE Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica, a columnist for DealBook, found that financial reform has added more twists to the convoluted world of derivatives. "They are replacing an opaque system prone to failures with a new, huge Rube Goldberg-like system that may reduce global financial risk. Or it may not. Nobody knows, not least the regulators themselves."
OLYMPUS INQUIRY "Japanese officials say that at least $4.9 billion is unaccounted for in a financial scandal at Olympus and are investigating whether much of that money went to companies with links to organized crime," reported Hiroko Tabuchi of The New York Times.
FACEBOOK FRAUD CLAIMS A Florida-based investment manager, was arrested "on charges of running an $11 million, two-year fraud that falsely promised investors access to coveted shares of Groupon, Facebook and other private companies," Mr. Roose reported.

HEADLINE: 'Exceptionalism' Argument May Prove Potent for Republicans

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: At a time when the country is facing an array of big challenges at home and abroad, the American exceptionalism argument may prove especially potent, and irresistible to Republicans, in this election. 

 BODY:
Few themes have recurred more regularly in the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination than American exceptionalism, and few are as potentially powerful - or divisive.
The idea that the United States is inherently special is well established in American politics, if a bit vaguely defined. By and large, Republicans have used the concept over the years to mean strength and to signal resolve. Democrats have tended to cite it when talking about values and the ideals of American democracy. 
In the context of the 2012 campaign, however, it has taken on a much more partisan edge, invoked by Republicans as a way to define President Obama as weak, lacking in core American values and almost unpatriotic.
It is easy to dismiss as election-season jingoism, the political equivalent of a "We're No. 1" chant from the cheap seats. But the exceptionalism argument offers some voters a reassuring counternarrative to persistent joblessness, a long-term hollowing out of the middle class and a sense that the nation's best days are past. And it intensifies the pressure on Mr. Obama to avoid sounding defensive about the difficult challenges he has faced as president and to articulate a positive story for why he deserves another four years.
"We have a president right now who thinks America's just another nation," Mitt Romney said last Saturday, at the most recent debate. "America is an exceptional nation. We have a president who thinks that the way to conduct foreign policy is through his personal effects on other people. I believe the way to conduct foreign policy is with American strength."
At a Values Voter convention in October, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said that "those in the White House today" do not believe in American exceptionalism and would rather emulate Europe. 
"The answer to our troubles lies in a positive, optimistic vision, with policies rooted in American exceptionalism," Mr. Perry said. "See, American exceptionalism is the product of unlimited freedom. And there is nothing troubling our nation today that cannot be solved by the rebirth of freedom - nothing." 
Conservatives have used the concept as part of a broader indictment of liberalism in the age of Obama. Writing in The Wall Street Journal in September, the author Shelby Steele suggested that Mr. Obama's upbringing in the 1960s shaped him into the embodiment of an anti-exceptionalism world view. 
"In this liberalism," he wrote, "America's exceptional status in the world follows from a bargain with the devil - an indulgence in militarism, racism, sexism, corporate greed, and environmental disregard as the means to a broad economic, military, and even cultural supremacy in the world. And therefore America's greatness is as much the fruit of evil as of a devotion to freedom."
In Mr. Obama, wrote Mr. Steele, "America gained a president with ambivalence, if not some antipathy, toward the singular greatness of the nation he had been elected to lead."
Voters of different ideological persuasions will read different things into these critiques: a malicious effort to identify Mr. Obama as the Other; a rallying cry for a new commitment to fundamental shared values; an emotional lashing out driven by fear of national decline, and a patriotic reassertion of American strength after a long and very difficult decade. 
There are factual and narrative rebuttals to much of the Republican case. In some ways, Mr. Obama has pursued a more aggressive national security policy than did his Republican predecessor, asserting American power, and presidential power, in a manner that is hard to characterize plausibly as weak. Mr. Obama's own personal story is nothing if not celebratory of the dynamism of American society.
When asked directly about American exceptionalism in 2009, Mr. Obama replied that people in Britain or Greece would also feel that their own countries are exceptional, , "I think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality, that, though imperfect, are exceptional."
But at a time when the country is facing an array of big challenges at home and abroad, there is clearly an opening among some voters for arguments of the sort being made by the Republican candidates. In a Time poll last month, 71 percent said America's position in the world is declining. 
According to a poll released this month by the Pew Research Center, just under half of Americans say the United States is the greatest country in the world, while most of the rest say it is one of the greatest countries. But there are striking differences between the generations. Only about a third of Americans between 18 and 30 say the United States is the greatest nation, about half the proportion of people 66 and older say they feel the same way. 
If the exceptionalism arguments resonate in the general election campaign, it will be because they speak to the feelings of anxiety and anger coursing through much of the electorate. One of the most striking poll findings of the season, from the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, is that nearly 60 percent of Americans view either the Tea Party or the Occupy Wall Street movements positively. 
This is not a happy electorate. That is why exceptionalism arguments, for all that they can bump uncomfortably close against the dark, divisive side of politics, may prove especially potent, and irresistible to Republicans, in this election. Their thematic power is in part negative, framing Mr. Obama as out of step with American values. 
But invoking exceptionalism and the sense of power and destiny at the heart of the concept also seems to tap into a desire to reassert control: over America's place in the world in an era of globalization and threats from stateless terrorists; over institutions judged to have failed us, and over a social contract - that if you work hard you will get your fair share - that seems to have frayed.

HEADLINE: Which Economic Indicators Best Predict Presidential Elections?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Hint: it's not the unemployment rate. 

 BODY:
I've written quite a bit in the past about the use and abuse of economic indicators in forecasting presidential elections. 
In general, my view has been that there's a lot of "physics envy" in thinking that something as complex as a presidential election can be boiled down to just one or two "fundamental" variables. Many models that attempt to do so suffer from a variety of technical and theoretical problems and their predictions have been mediocre when applied in the real world. 
But this obscures a question that is interesting on its own merits: which economic variables have done the best job in explaining the results of past presidential elections?
One complication in evaluating these models is that they usually include other data in addition to the economic variables themselves: variables to denote wartime or peacetime, or various ways to measure incumbency, or polling data, and so forth. There is not necessarily any problem in including these things -- I'm certainly a believer in making forecasts based on polls, for instance. But they tend to obscure the question of how much predictive power the economic variables have had on their own.
A related problem is that all of the models handle the economic data in their own idiosyncratic ways. Some take the variable on a per-capita basis while others do not. Some used revised data while others use the variable as originally reported. Some models are applied to elections all the way back to the 19th century, while some look at as few as the eight or ten most recent ones. Some look at the variable for just one quarter of the election year, while others consider longer time periods.
Which economic indicators do best if they are put on a level playing field? Let's establish a set of ground rules so that we can make some apples-to-apples comparisons.
First, our sample will consist of all elections since World War II -- that is, the 16 presidential elections from 1948 through 2008. The reason for this choice is that many commonly used economic data series were first published shortly after the war, particularly in 1947 or 1948. I admire models that go further back than this -- if you're claiming that a variable is truly fundamental, it ought to hold up under a variety of different economic and social milieus. But other than one or two variables like G.D.P. and the inflation rate, there aren't very many variables available prior to 1947, and our goal here is to see how quite a few different economic indicators perform. 
Second, we'll be looking how the variable performed from January through September of the election year. The reason we'll use September as the cut-off date rather than October or November is because many of these variables are only available only on a quarterly basis -- so data from the fourth quarter will include results from after the election took place. I don't personally think this is a huge deal, but using the first nine months of the election year is as close to anything as an industry standard. (There's reasonably clear evidence, on the other hand, that performance earlier in a president's term may not matter very much. Some models even contend that poor economic performance during the first two years of a president's term can be helpful to him.) 
Third, although this is a fairly technical point, we will be using the most recent data revisions for all variables, such as was available through the Federal Reserve as of the week of Nov. 13, 2011. 
Fourth, we'll be looking at how well the variables predicted the incumbent party's margin of victory or defeat in the popular vote. This is also a fairly minor issue as most models use close variants of this approach (although a few take more exotic attitudes like counting all third-party votes against the incumbent party). 
As to which economic variables we'll be looking at, the answer is ... all of them. Well, not literally all of them. But I have retrieved data for 43 such variables, including almost all of the ones that economists and investors use most commonly. What these variables have in common is that they are available dating back to 1948, that they are easily accessible to the public (with a few exceptions, they are available at the Federal Reserve's Web site), and that they are relatively easy to calculate. I have adjusted the variables for inflation in some cases when the publicly available versions did not, but that is about as complicated as it gets. If you don't see a variable listed here, it's because it did not begin to be tracked until well after 1948, or because it has an ambiguous economic interpretation.
What you'll see next is a chart evaluating the performance of the 43 variables on the basis of their coefficient of determination or . The interpretation of is that it describes how much of the variance in a dependent variable (in this case, election results since 1948) can be explained by an independent variable. An of .30 or 30 percent, for instance, implies that the variable explains about 30 percent of election results (leaving the other 70 percent unexplained). Normally, scores are always expressed as positive numbers, but I have listed them as negative instead in a handful of cases where the election results have been related to the variable in the opposite of the expected direction. For instance, the incumbent party has actually done better (although not to any statistically significant degree) when the personal savings rate has been lower, perhaps because this variable is a bit counter-cyclical and people tend to save more of their incomes when the economy is struggling.
So let's see how the 43 variables rank:
The first thing to notice is that no individual economic variable has an higher than .46, meaning that none can explain more than half of election results in the post-war period. If you see models that claim to have more explanatory power than this, it is because they are using additional data (like polling) besides economic variables, or because the model has been jury-rigged to maximize its "fit" on past data in ways that will contribute little to its true predictive accuracy. The economy is hugely important to presidential elections, but there are no magic bullets.
Perhaps the best starting point is to see how the most commonly-used economic variable -- G.D.P. -- compares to election results:
There is definitely a relationship between G.D.P. and election results. But, it isn't a perfect one. While the election results were pretty much exactly in line with what you'd expect from G.D.P. in many years like 1960, 1980, 2004, 2008 and so forth, it would not have given you a good prediction in 1952, 1956, 1976, or 1992. Overall the for G.D.P. is .33 in elections since 1948. That is, about 33 percent of election results are explained by G.D.P., leaving about two-thirds of the results unexplained. For what it's worth, while this might sound underwhelming, the relationship has actually grown stronger over time. If you run the numbers back to 1880 (using Ray Fair's economic data for years prior to World War II), the is somewhat weaker at .23.
One popular alternative to using G.D.P. is the variable real disposable income per capita. I made some fun of this variable in my recent New York Times Magazine piece, not because it is inherently ridiculous (it seeks to measure something useful, take-home income) but because its popularity in a number of political science forecasting models probably stems more from the fact that it happened to 'fit' the data quite well for a number of elections from about 1960 through 1988. Outside of that window, however, it's performance has been mediocre. It did badly, for instance, in 1948, 1952, 1956 and 2000, and to a lesser extent in 1992. Overall, it's R-squared in post-war elections is .30, essentially the same as for plain-vanilla G.D.P.
Even though G.D.P. and disposable income only explain about a third of election results, they do perform better than some other commonly-used variables. The inflation rate during the first nine months of the election year, for instance, has had only a loose relationship to election outcomes.
This variable is a little tricky since there was really only one post-war election, 1980, in which inflation was especially high. Jimmy Carter did do extremely poorly that year, although there were a lot of other problems with the economy as well. Overall, however, it's is just .10. (In fact, there are several different ways to calculate the inflation rate, none of which have done much better or worse than this.)
Another poorly performing variable is the unemployment rate. It has had essentially no relationship to election results at all.
However, while the unemployment had told us very little, the rate of in the jobs market has been fairly meaningful. Here, for instance, is a comparison of election results to the rate of payroll jobs growth -- the variable you often see highlighted when the government releases its jobs report on the first Friday of each month.
This variable has had an of .44 -- a fair amount better than G.D.P. or disposable income. Thus, while the raw rate of unemployment has been one of the least useful variables for forecasting election results, the rate of job growth during the election year (whether measured by this variable or by closely-related ones like the net change in the unemployment rate or the employment-to-population ratio) has held up pretty well. So pay attention to those employment reports, as common sense would dictate. I apologize if I'd given you a contrary impression in the past, but I hadn't dug into the data this deeply.
The broader point -- and one thing this evidence is fairly definitive upon -- is that the rate of change is what counts. Americans will give a fair amount of credit to a president in an economy that is still below its full productive capacity provided that it seems to be getting better. This can also be seen in the poor performance of the variable actual-to-potential G.D.P. (which tracks output against its long-term trend-line) as compared to the comparatively strong performance of the rate of G.D.P. growth during the election year.
Another class of variables that might be avoided are those related to government activity. For instance, the government expenditures component of G.D.P. has had almost no relationship to election results; it ranks 42nd out of 43 variables and the relationship has actually been slightly negative historically. Likewise, the ratio of net government savings to G.D.P. -- essentially, a measure of deficits -- has had no predictive power one way or the other.
Meanwhile, the best-performing variable has been the ISM manufacturing index, which is a measure of how much manufacturing businesses are ramping up or ramping down their activity. It has had an of .46.
The manufacturing index has several things going for it. It is considered a fairly good leading indicator of economic activity in general and of jobs growth in particular, and it represents a composite score from five different component indicators, including things like the employment environment and new factory orders.
So does this mean you should all go out and use the ISM manufacturing index in your forecasting models? Actually, maybe not. It is certainly worth looking at. But when you're testing 43 different economic indicators over a sample of just 16 elections, the best-performing ones are likely to have been a little lucky. 
In fact, the relative rank of the economic indicators has historically been very inconsistent: those that perform best over one set of elections do not do much better over the long-term. We will discuss this problem at more length in a follow-up to this article.

HEADLINE: Winner in Redistricting Is Still to Be Determined

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: What was supposed to have been a clear advantage for the Republican Party has turned into more of a muddle. 

 BODY:
Republican legislative victories in the 2010 elections were hailed as a major opportunity for the party to redraw district lines to their benefit ahead of next year's Congressional voting.
But what was supposed to have been a clear advantage for the Republicans has turned into more of a muddle, with both parties claiming some advantages but conceding that the year-long redistricting process could end up a wash in the end.
In part, that's because of some legal rulings that have set back Republican efforts to use their legislative majorities to push their advantage.
In Arizona this week, a court overturned an effort by Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, to oust the chairwoman of the state's bipartisan redistricting commission. The courts said that Ms. Brewer had overstepped her authority and ordered the chairwoman, Colleen Mathis, to be reinstated.
Democrats hailed the decision, saying it would help ensure a fair process as the commission finishes drawing the state's Congressional districts. 
Republicans have also run into legal roadblocks in Texas, where a federal court rejected attempts by the G.O.P.-controlled legislature to boost the party's Congressional edge. Because of population growth, Texas will gain four seats in the House next year, and the legislature had tried to draw districts that heavily favored Republicans.
Instead, the court is likely to impose a temporary map of its own that could give Democrats a slight boost going into the election next year.
Redistricting does not determine the outcome of every race. Campaigns still have to be waged, and strong candidates can still defeat poor ones, even in districts with voting histories that would suggest the stronger candidate has an uphill battle. 
When districts that historically vote a particular way are consolidated, parties can make it difficult -- and costly -- for their rivals to win there. 
Here's how the two parties describe the situation:
DEMOCRATS
If you listen to officials at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, things are looking up for their candidates. 
They point to states like California, Illinois and Nevada, where independent commissions or legislatures under Democratic control have increased the party's chances of gaining seats. 
And they say the legal situations in Arizona, Texas and Colorado -- where a district judge chose a map that favors Democrats in two crucial districts -- have undercut the Republican legislative advantage.
"Redistricting is far from being a blow-out as Republicans announced, and we have exceeded expectations," Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic campaign committee, said in a memo this week. 
Mr. Israel and his top aides concede that Republican redistricting in North Carolina was not good for several of their Democratic incumbents, who will now have to earn re-election in districts that have more Republican-leaning precincts.
But they argue that the Democratic representatives in North Carolina had to be more conservative just to win in that state last year, amid the Republican blowout elsewhere. And they say that makes it harder for Republicans to oust them next year, when President Obama will be campaigning heavily in the state.
"All of our North Carolina incumbents had tough races in difficult districts last year in the worst cycle in a generation - and they won," Mr. Israel said in the memo. "Our North Carolina colleagues are battle-tested and field ready. The hill might have gotten steeper, but they know how to successfully make the climb."
REPUBLICANS: 
The Republicans, of course, take a different view. Officials at the National Republican Campaign Committee like to focus on Republican-held seats -- many of them won for the first time in 2010 -- that have become stronger for them during the redistricting process.
Those include five seats in Ohio, several in Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois, and several in California. Taken together, there are 25 Republican incumbents whose re-election battles have gotten less competitive because of the redistricting, according to party officials.
That, in turn, makes it harder for Democrats to cobble together the 25 seats they need to regain the majority and reclaim the speakership from Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio.
"Redistricting has created a huge roadblock in the Democrats' 'Drive to 25,' " said Paul Lindsay, the director of communications for the committee. "A wash, or even a net gain of a few seats for them, is simply not enough to overcome the rebuke voters are prepared to send to President Obama and his party."
Republican officials say the legal challenges in places like Arizona, Colorado and Texas will not provide as much of a boost to Democrats as they like to suggest. They note that the court-imposed maps may make the states more of an even match.
And the Republicans say the changes in places like North Carolina will put pressure on Democrats to spend their money defending incumbent Democrats rather than in districts where they can defeat incumbent Republicans. That will make it tougher for Democrats to win back control of the House, they said.
WHAT TO WATCH
The temporary map in Texas is due to be drawn by the courts there in the coming weeks, and will signal how much opportunity Democrats have to make gains in that state.
Both parties are also watching the process in Virginia and Pennsylvania, where the legislatures are still not finished with their maps.
Virginia's legislature, which will be under effective Republican control starting in January, has yet to complete its maps. Republicans are hoping to do so after they take over. But a lawsuit has been filed asking the courts to impose a map, saying delays would violate the state constitution and make required clearance by the Justice Department difficult.
In Pennsylvania, Republicans have five freshman members whose victories in 2010 they are eager to protect. A redistricting map could make those members more or less vulnerable to Democratic challenges.

HEADLINE: Nissan C.E.O. Carlos Ghosn, on Surviving the Five Crises

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The Nissan chief executive was in Manhattan Thursday to discuss how the Japanese automaker had responded to five recent tests, both manmade and natural, of the company's health. 

 BODY:
Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's chief executive, is something of a superstar in Japan, where he appears as the hero in a manga comic book called "The True Story of Carlos Ghosn." And that perhaps explains the sellout crowd when Mr. Ghosn appeared as a lunch speaker at the Japan Society in Manhattan on Thursday, with a talk titled The New Normal: Driving Change Through Crisis.
Mr. Ghosn, who became chief executive of Nissan in 2001 and added duties as head of Renault in 2005, told attendees that he had never seen a tougher period for the company than in the last three years. He pointed to five crises that affected the company: financial turmoil in the United States; the sovereign debt crisis in Europe; the strong yen; the March earthquake in northeastern Japan; and the recent flooding in Thailand. "How do you manage the company through that?" he said.
According to Mr. Ghosn, one of his first decisions after hearing about the Japanese earthquake was to keep the Nissan Leaf on track. The battery electric car, he said, was "the anti-crisis weapon" because it combated the company's exposure to high oil prices as well as, however infinitesimally, global warming.
Hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery electrics are all part of the solution, Mr. Ghosn said, though he personally preferred the battery electric.
"But the batteries are still too heavy and expensive," he said. "The evolution of the battery is extremely important for development in the 21st century."
In response to a question, Mr. Ghosn said that Nissan would work to improve its position as the No. 3 Japanese automaker in the United States, behind Toyota and Honda, but that the company's strongest push would be happening in emerging markets.
"I don't think we face overcapacity in the developing world, though we could have it in the developed world," he said. Sales in China may slow, he said, but continued demand for passenger cars, despite a lottery system that prevents some people from buying personal vehicles, ensured a continued strong market for the brand.
To reinforce his position, Mr. Ghosn said that Americans owned 800 cars for every 1,000 people, whereas in Brazil the ratio is 200 for every 1,000, China 60 for every 1,000 and India 15 for every 1,000. "How can you have over-capacity in these countries, which are now in full development?" he said.
Given the setting on Thursday, Mr. Ghosn did note that Nissan was making money "everywhere but in Japan," where profitability was hampered by the appreciating yen. He said that Japanese automakers might prefer to add new production capacity in the home country, but financial realities dictated that they have plants abroad.
Asked what he'd say in an audience with the Japanese prime minister, Mr. Ghosn said that in lieu of a laundry list of grievances, he'd simply say, "Fix the exchange rate."

HEADLINE: Romney Pessimistic on Debt Committee

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney expressed pointed doubts about the ability of the Congressional panel on deficit reduction to reach an acceptable solution. 

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - With a literary flourish, Mitt Romney expressed pointed doubts on Friday about the ability of the deficit reduction committee to reach an acceptable solution, saying that failure to do so would lead to a "Faustian bargain" that would cut the military budget.
"You know I'm not terribly optimistic about the process of the supercommittee," said Mr. Romney, adding that he wasn't sure that the Congressional committee, which is scheduled to deliver its report next week, would come up with "a satisfactory recommendation."
"If that's the case, we have been fed a Faustian bargain, which is that we'll see hundreds of billions of dollars cut from our military, at a very time when the world is not a safe place and our military is engaged in conflict - an entirely unacceptable outcome," Mr. Romney said in response to a question about the committee at a Chamber of Commerce event here Friday.
The crowd of several dozen, gathered awkwardly around balconies and stairways in an office atrium, applauded as Mr. Romney added: "If I'm president, I will restore those military cuts. We simply cannot cut America's military, in my view." 
Offering his own solution, Mr. Romney rattled off several steps he would take to curb the budget - cutting government programs, returning Medicaid to the states, and making government itself smaller and more efficient.
"I would reduce the number of federal employees, and I would link federal employee compensation to that which exists in the private sector," he said. "In my view, government workers shouldn't make more money than the taxpayers."
Mr. Romney also said the committee needed to tackle the issue of entitlement programs for the coming generation.
"And then finally, I want to see the supercommittee come forward with proposals to make Medicare and Social Security sustainable for the next generation," he said. "Those programs are going to do just fine for the current people on those programs and near retirees. But Version 2.0 for the young people coming along, we've got to tell them the truth about how the finances will have to work, and they'll have the chance to make a choice as to what, under the plan I'd have, what kind of future they'd have under those programs."
He also criticized the Democrats, suggesting that they'd like to increase taxes.
"I think what our Democratic friends would like to see come forward is a proposal to raise taxes a lot, and the problem with that - well there's a lot of problems with that, we'd all have lighter wallets - is that the economy slows down, and this would be a heck of a time to slow down the economy," he said.

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Potsdam Bread-Van Edition

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Volkswagen showed a purely electric delivery-van concept in Potsdam, Germany, on Friday. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Volkswagen presented a purely electric commercial delivery van concept on Friday in Potsdam, Germany. The automaker is calling the eT a research vehicle, and as such did not disclose details about its powertrain or battery capacity. The design team did, however, set out to create a "very emotionally appealing" van, which may explain the clear influence of the 2001 Volkswagen Microbus concept, which was never placed into production. (Volkswagen)
 Angus MacKenzie, the former editor of Britain's Car magazine who became editor in chief of Motor Trend in 2005, has left his post for an executive position at Source Interlink Media. Mr. MacKenzie is succeeded at Motor Trend by Edward Loh, the magazine's former executive editor. Source Interlink, which publishes Motor Trend as well as Automobile magazine and a number of niche performance titles, filed for bankruptcy in 2009. On Wednesday at the 2011 Los Angeles auto show, Motor Trend named the 2012 Volkswagen Passat its Car of the Year. (Source Interlink Companies)
 Toyota inaugurated an $800 million production facility outside Tupelo, Miss., on Thursday. The plant will assemble the Corolla compact sedan for the North American market, with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles. Initially, the plant was intended to produce the Highlander crossover vehicle, but production was shifted instead to the company's plant in Princeton, Ind. Toyota said that the facility would employ 2,000 workers. (Toyota)
 According to a report in the Nikkei business daily, Daimler and its strategic partner, Nissan, intend to build a joint production facility in Mexico. The two automakers entered into an agreement in April 2010 to share development costs of engines and vehicle platforms for application in small cars. But according to the Nikkei, larger luxury vehicles may be produced at the plant, if it were to be built. (Reuters)
 Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain inaugurated the production center of McLaren Automotive in Woking, England, this week. The center, designed by the architectural firm of Sir Norman Foster, will produce the MP4-12C supercar and subsequent models from the brand. Mr. Foster's firm was also retained by McLaren to design its technology center, visited by Norman Mayersohn of The Times's Automobiles section earlier this year. (McLaren)

HEADLINE: Capitalizing on Collapse

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Many Republicans and Democrats have concluded that they will get more out of the failure of negotiations to cut the deficit than they would out of success. 

 BODY:
A new political calculus is emerging on both sides of the aisle now that it looks as if the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction may fail to reach an agreement by Wednesday's deadline.
Democrats, who have taken a beating since the 2010 election, are legitimately worried that Republicans will use the collapse of budget talks to pursue their own grand strategy.
Publicly, Republicans say they are determined to do everything possible to help the so-called supercommittee achieve its goals. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, said, "Boehner recognizes we are $15 trillion in debt, we need to deal with that right now, and he does not think we can wait until next election."
In private, however, a number of Republicans acknowledge that alternatives to action by the supercommittee look highly attractive, if risky.
Should the supercommittee fail, the wheels begin to turn on $1.2 trillion in across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, which split evenly between domestic and military programs.
There is bipartisan agreement that these cuts make no distinction among meat, bone and fat. The key political factor, however, is that the cuts go into effect after the 2012 election. Just as important, the "temporary" Bush tax cuts - enacted in 2001, 2002, and 2003 - terminate at the end of 2012.
Here is the Republican gamble: Intrade, the political futures market, currently puts the odds at just under three to one in favor of both a Republican takeover of the Senate and retention of the House - 74.4 to 21.5 for the Senate, 72.2 to 28 for the House.
The big question is the presidential contest. According to an ABC poll, a majority of Americans, by a margin of 55 to 37, believe that the Republican nominee will be victorious. Republican voters are overwhelmingly optimistic about their chances for the White House, 83-13. Democrats, by the far smaller margin of 58-33 percent, think President Obama will win re-election. Independents, by a 54-36 margin, believe that the Republicans will take the presidency.
The chance of all three contests going the Republicans' way is less than 50-50, but if they do, the payoff would be huge. The risk is outweighed by the benefits of winning. What's at stake? The power to further tilt the tax code in favor of the affluent and to perform progressively more radical surgery on the welfare state.
Given long-range demographic trends - the growth of the minority electorate and the increasing numbers of unmarried, Democratic-leaning voters, especially single women - the 2012 election could prove to be the last chance for the contemporary conservative movement to put a decisive stamp on the government.
As a top Republican Congressional aide put it in a interview about the supercommittee's deliberations, "Winning the trifecta - House, Senate and White House - in 2012 is a game changer. We would be in the driver's seat."
In this scenario, Republicans in the 113th Congress would swiftly enact a version of the budget proposal put forward by Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, which was approved by the House, but only the House, earlier this year.
The Ryan budget, which includes making the Bush tax cuts permanent, would meet the required $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, eliminating the need for across-the-board cuts. The measure would be contained in budget "reconciliation" legislation so that it would not be subject to a filibuster in the Senate and could be enacted by simple majorities in both branches. A Republican president would be sure to sign it.
A central Democratic player in the supercommittee negotiations noted that "there is a lot of fear" that the failure of the supercommittee "is intentional, that the Republicans are waiting until January, 2013, after an election has taken place. Who is in control will have enormous consequence."
Capitalizing on collapse is not the exclusive terrain of the right. There are some on the left who believe that simply taking no action whatsoever before this year's November 23 and December 23 deadlines will force the expiration of the Bush tax cuts at the end of 2012. The expiration of these cuts will produce an estimated $3.8 trillion in new revenue between 2013 and 2022 - enough to maintain many of the key safety net programs with relatively minor tinkering.
Of course, this strategy depends either on a Democratic chief executive to veto Republican legislation extending the Bush cuts or on the less likely event of Democratic retention of the Senate or a takeover of the House.
The risks to both sides of a do-nothing-for-now strategy are arguably outweighed by the many possible advantages. The economic policy gulf between the parties has become so wide that it seems impossible, barring the use of accounting gimmicks, for them to split the difference.
The anti-tax, anti-government ideology of the right cannot be legitimately reconciled the with pro-government, high-tax commitment of the left, and vice versa. On top of that, these competing ideologies have acquireda moral dimensionthat makes ordinary political give-and-take intolerable.
Notions of unilateral victory, whether through Republican domination of Washington or through the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, become increasingly attractive, no matter how fanciful, if the alternative is engaging in the processes of honest bargaining, accommodation, negotiation and compromise.

HEADLINE: Federal Subsidies for Renewable Energy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Turning solar power into reality is important for America. NRG's California Valley Solar Ranch project, mentioned in ''Rich Subsidies Powering Solar and Wind Projects'' (front page, Nov. 12), is actually an example of a constructive public-private partnership essential for our energy future.
NRG has invested more than $1 billion of our own capital in solar projects, helping develop the industry and jobs. The government loans will be repaid, with interest. In the article the expected rate of return on the project is dramatically overstated. 
Also, the article makes it seem as if the project is bad for ratepayers -- but keep in mind that the project is the result of a California sustainable energy referendum and thoughtful leaders who understand the challenge of meeting those standards.
NRG's California solar project is exactly the sort of innovative effort that will create jobs, spur innovation and help make a sustainable energy future possible.
DAVID CRANE Chief Executive, NRG Energy Princeton, N.J., Nov. 13, 2011
To the Editor:
Your article does a great service in detailing the oversubsidization of alternative energy, but doesn't mention the biggest problem with these kinds of direct subsidies: They are addictive and create long-term corporate dependency. What happens when budgets get cut and the subsidies run out, as happened in Spain? Complete collapse.
There is only one sustainable way to support alternative energy; only one way to reward success, not failure; only one incentive whose disappearance does not spell disaster: supply-side tax cuts for green energy. That means elimination of corporate taxes, capital gains taxes, sales taxes and estate taxes for clean, renewable energy investments.
Such tax cuts promote success, not failure, because they benefit only companies with sustainable revenues and profits. Investors would be encouraged to invest in such businesses because their profits will be tax-free, a huge advantage over other investments.
We have directly subsidized enough alternative energy start-ups in the United States. We have already rewarded failures like Solyndra. Now we need to separate the wheat from the chaff.
With supply-side tax cuts for green energy, the most competitive, profitable alternative energy models will survive, thrive and attract more capital, and unsustainable models will disappear.
R. RANDOLPH RICHARDSON New York, Nov. 13, 2011
The writer is the director of the Grace Richardson Fund, a public policy-oriented foundation.
To the Editor:
Federal support for renewable energy provides jobs across all 50 states when we need them most and enhances our national security.
Your article does not fully describe a successful energy program with a remarkable return on investment to the public, the Treasury Department's 1603 grant program. After two years, it has already leveraged over $21.5 billion in private sector investment to jump-start more than 22,000 projects across a wide range of energy technologies. This has created tens of thousands of new American jobs. The 1603 program allows a dozen energy industries, not just solar, to use more effectively already-paid-for tax credits supported by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. An independent analysis by EuPD Research shows that a one-year extension of this program will add 37,000 jobs next year alone, while leveraging significant private investment across America.
Energy fuels our nation's growth, and always will. From 19th-century coal through 20th-century oil, natural gas and nuclear energy, no energy industry in the United States has succeeded without substantial investment from the federal government.
It was right to invest in those industries to power our economy then. It is right to invest in solar to power our economy now.
RHONE RESCH President and Chief Executive Solar Energy Industries Association Washington, Nov. 12, 2011

HEADLINE: Markets Hover as Investors Wait to See Action on Debt

BYLINE: By REUTERS; David Jolly reported from Paris and Raphael Minder reported from Madrid. Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
The worst week for stocks in two months ended with traders mostly sitting it out Friday as they waited for politicians in Europe and the United States to tackle festering debt problems. 
The Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were little changed, and the Nasdaq index fell.
Friday's market showed more exhaustion than relief as Europe remained investors' primary worry. Stocks found support after Italian and Spanish bond yields fell as a result of buying by the European Central Bank.
In the United States, doubts grew over whether a bipartisan committee could come up next week with budget cuts and tax increases that Congress could agree on.
Financial shares, which have been among the most sensitive to euro zone financial strains, rose on Friday. The S.& P. financial index was up 0.5 percent. Morgan Stanley shares edged up 0.6 percent to $14.21 but fell more than 13 percent this week.
A major question has been whether the European Central Bank will find a way to act as a lender of last resort in the manner of the Federal Reserve in the United States.
Speculation has grown that the central bank could lend money to the International Monetary Fund to bail out some euro zone members.
''It's hard to see the E.C.B. changing roles, but on the other hand, the powers to be have to be very aware of the consequences if this gets out of control,'' said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo advantage funds in New York.
The Dow gained 25.43 points, or 0.22 percent, to 11,796.16. The S.& P. dipped 0.48 points, or 0.04 percent, to 1,215.65. The Nasdaq lost 15.49 points, or 0.60 percent, to 2,572.50.
For the week, the Dow fell 2.9 percent, the S.& P. dropped 3.8 percent and the Nasdaq lost 4 percent.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 99 21/32, and the yield rose to 2.01 percent, from 1.97 percent late Thursday.
A gauge of future economic activity in the United States rose more than expected in October.
The Conference Board reported that its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.9 percent last month, significantly faster than the revised 0.1 percent rise in September and the 0.3 percent increase in August.
The rebound reflected contributions from building permits, the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates, a rising stock market and a slightly better employment reading.

HEADLINE: Sierra Club Leader Plans To Leave Group Next Year

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
Carl Pope, who has led the Sierra Club for much of the last two decades, is planning to leave the organization next year as it struggles to redefine its mission in a tough economy, the organization said Friday. 
The move reflects a broader debate among many of the nation's environmental groups, which are finding it a challenge to raise money, motivate activists and build public support for core concerns like climate change in the face of high unemployment and hostility from Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail.
Membership rolls at the Sierra Club, one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious environmental groups, have dropped sharply in the current economic downturn and the organization has undergone a sharp internal debate over priorities. Mr. Pope advocated partnerships with business and industry on a number of environmental projects, alienating some of group's older donors and activists. Mr. Pope, 66, stepped down as executive director last year after 17 years, turning the job over to Michael Brune, 40, who came to the Sierra Club from the Rainforest Action Network and Greenpeace, younger and politically more aggressive groups. Mr. Pope has held the title of chairman since Mr. Brune arrived and will remain a consultant to the club until the end of next year.
Mr. Pope could not immediately be reached for comment.
His departure was first reported by The Los Angeles Times at its Web site on Friday.
Mr. Brune said in an interview that he did not have major philosophical disagreements with Mr. Pope. Both believe that the group's central focus should be combating climate change and supporting alternative energy sources. Mr. Brune acknowledged that paid membership had declined by about 100,000 in recent years, to just more than 600,000, but attributed it to financial hardship caused by the recession.
He said the Sierra Club had just approved the organization's largest annual budget ever, about $100 million for 2012, up from $88 million this year.
Mr. Pope alienated some Sierra Club members by signing a four-year deal with Clorox to put the club's logo on a line of supposedly environmentally friendly products, bringing the organization $1.3 million but, in the eyes of many, sullying its image.
Mr. Pope said in a statement released by the group that he would dedicate his time to working with business, labor, technology innovators and local government to strengthen American manufacturing. ''To be competitive in the 21st century, a revitalized manufacturing sector must deploy clean energy, low-carbon fuels and sustainable technologies,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe Fears a Credit Squeeze As Investors Sell Bond Holdings

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and ERIC DASH; Graham Bowley and Liz Alderman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Nervous investors around the globe are accelerating their exit from the debt of European governments and banks, increasing the risk of a credit squeeze that could set off a downward spiral.
Financial institutions are dumping their vast holdings of European government debt and spurning new bond issues by countries like Spain and Italy. And many have decided not to renew short-term loans to European banks, which are needed to finance day-to-day operations.
If this trend continues, it risks creating a vicious cycle of rising borrowing costs, deeper spending cuts and slowing growth, which is hard to get out of, especially as some European banks are having trouble meeting their financing needs.
''It's a pretty terrible spiral,'' said Peter R. Fisher, head of fixed income at the asset manager BlackRock and a former senior Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration. 
The pullback -- which is increasing almost daily -- is driven by worries that some European countries may not be able to fully repay their bond borrowings, which in turn would damage banks that own large amounts of those bonds. It also increases the already rising pressure on the European Central Bank to take more aggressive action.
On Friday, the bank's new president, Mario Draghi, put the onus on European leaders to deploy the long-awaited euro zone bailout fund to resolve the crisis, implicitly rejecting calls for the European Central Bank to step up and become the region's ''lender of last resort.''
The flight from European sovereign debt and banks has spanned the globe. European institutions like the Royal Bank of Scotland and pension funds in the Netherlands have been heavy sellers in recent days. And earlier this month, Kokusai Asset Management in Japan unloaded nearly $1 billion in Italian debt.
At the same time, American institutions are pulling back on loans to even the sturdiest banks in Europe. When a $300 million certificate of deposit held by Vanguard's $114 billion Prime Money Market Fund from Rabobank in the Netherlands came due on Nov. 9, Vanguard decided to let the loan expire and move the money out of Europe. Rabobank enjoys a AAA-credit rating and is considered one of the strongest banks in the world.
''There's a real sensitivity to being in Europe,'' said David Glocke, head of money market funds at Vanguard. ''When the noise gets loud it's better to watch from the sidelines rather than stay in the game. Even highly rated banks, such as Rabobank, I'm letting mature.''
The latest evidence that governments, too, are facing a buyers' strike came Thursday, when a disappointing response to Spain's latest 10-year bond offering allowed rates to climb to nearly 7 percent, a new record. A French bond auction also received a lukewarm response.
Traders said that fewer international buyers were stepping up at the auctions. The European Central Bank cannot buy directly from governments but is purchasing euro zone debt in the open market. Bond rates settled somewhat Friday, with Italian yields hovering at 6.6 percent and Spanish rates around 6.3 percent; each had been below 5 percent earlier this year.
For Spain, the recent rise in rates means having to spend an extra 1.8 billion euros ($2.4 billion) annually to borrow, rapidly narrowing the options of European leaders. For Italy, every 1 percent rise in rates translates to about 6 billion euros (about $8 billion) in extra costs annually, according to Barclays Capital.
If officials simply cut spending to pay the added interest costs, they face further economic contraction at home. If they ignore the bond market, however, they could find themselves unable to borrow and pay their bills.
Either situation risks choking off growth in Europe and threatens the stability of the Continent's banks, which would further undermine demand and business confidence in the United States and around the world.
Experts say the cycle of anxiety, forced selling and surging borrowing costs is reminiscent of the months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when worries about subprime mortgages in the United States metastasized into a global market crisis.
Just as American policy makers assured the public then that the subprime problem could be contained, so European leaders thought until recently that the fiscal troubles of a small country like Greece would not spread.
But after the bankruptcy last month of MF Global, spurred by its exposure to $6.3 billion of European debt, other institutions have raced to purge their portfolios of similar investments.
''This is just a repeat of what we saw in 2008, when everyone wanted to see toxic assets off the banks' balance sheets,'' said Christian Stracke, the head of credit research for Pimco.
The European bond sell-off has been similarly sharp, accelerating in the third quarter, according to a research report by Goldman Sachs. European banks trimmed their exposure to Italy by more than 26 billion euros in the third quarter, for example. French banks like BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, whose shares have been pounded lately because of their sovereign debt holdings, were among the biggest sellers.
Meanwhile, American banks have become skittish about lending to European institutions over similar concerns. Of the biggest banks that lend to Europe, about two-thirds have pulled back on lending to their European counterparts, according to the most recent survey of loan officers by the Federal Reserve.
American money market funds, long a key supplier of dollars to European banks through short-term loans, have also become nervous. Fund managers have cut their holdings of notes issued by euro zone banks by $261 billion from around its peak in May, a 54 percent drop, according to JPMorgan Chase research.
With borrowing costs ticking higher, more institutions have started selling their sovereign debt, creating a frenzy that forces bond prices to plunge and yields to rise at dizzying speeds, which begets even more selling. In the case of Italy, the yield on 10-year bonds spiked to current levels in a month, a huge move by government bond market standards.
The dynamic of falling bond prices also undermines the capital position of the banks, since they are among the biggest holders of government bonds in many countries. As those assets plunge in value, banks cut back on lending and hoard capital, increasing the likelihood of a recession.
In some cases, banks may even need to raise funds to shore up their financial positions. That was the case with UniCredit, Italy's largest bank, which announced plans to raise 7.5 billion euros in capital earlier this week.
''The biggest risk everyone is talking about is whether Italy can continue to fund itself,'' said Pavan Wadhwa, an interest rate strategist at JPMorgan in London. He said Italy had auctions Nov. 25 and 29. Any sign that it is unable to sell its debt to investors would be troubling, he said.
The prospect of slower growth across the Continent, and fears that budget deficits will balloon, is a major reason the selling has spread beyond Italian bonds to much stronger government borrowers with AAA credit ratings like France.
''You have to interfere with these cycles at as many places as possible,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, President Obama's former chief economic adviser. ''There is nothing good to be said about being tentative.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 23, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about investors' accelerating withdrawal from European sovereign debt misstated the title and experience of Peter R. Fisher, who commented on the trend's detrimental effect on the fiscal health of Europe. He is the head of fixed income at the asset manager BlackRock, not a vice chairman, and he was a senior Treasury official in the administration of President George W. Bush, not of President Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: In the Labyrinth of Turkey Pricing, a Reason Under Every Giblet

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
I'M about to go out and buy a turkey. And naturally, because I write about finance, I was thinking about how much I would pay for it and, more specifically, whether the rising price of agricultural commodities and fuel had affected the cost.
It turns out that turkey pricing is not much tied to commodities prices. Instead, other factors, like tight margins for farmers and perceptions of value, play a much bigger role.
For most of us, the price we pay for our turkey bears little relation to what it costs to raise it.
A frozen Shady Brook Farms turkey at my local Stop & Shop in Stamford, Conn., was advertised this week for 58 cents a pound. That would put the cost for a standard 16-pound turkey at $9.28. At the A.& P. up the street, an unnamed frozen bird was on sale for 49 cents a pound. 
This is price competition at its fiercest -- and both below cost. Cody Brokmeyer, agricultural statistician in charge of turkeys at the National Agricultural Statistics Service, said the average cost of a live turkey in October was 77 cents a pound. But processing adds another 40 cents or so a pound. Then, there are the shipping costs. And those ads cost something, too. In other words, there is no way a turkey costs 49 cents a pound.
''It's very competitive at the retail level, and that turkey gets someone through the door,'' said John Anderson, senior economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Contrast that with the high-end turkey, whose price is determined as much by scarcity as allure. Heritage turkeys -- essentially, old-fashioned varieties that are much bigger and take longer to reach maturity -- are becoming increasingly popular, and they command top dollar. Heritage Foods USA, based in Brooklyn, sells a 16-pound turkey for $114 plus shipping.
Here is a look at some of the numbers behind the bird, for those of us picking up our turkeys in the next few days. They may influence your purchasing decisions, or at least help you appreciate how a turkey can cost more than $100.
COMMODITIES AND PRICE The two main commodities that go into a turkey are feed corn and soybeans. Prices for both have gone up sharply in the last year.
Since feed is typically 60 to 70 percent of the cost of raising a turkey, I figured there would be a commensurate rise in turkey prices. But I found out that while the price of a turkey has risen this year, it has increased only moderately.
David Harvey, poultry analyst at the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service, said the price for a bushel of feed corn was $6.69 in September, up 54 percent from $4.32 the year before. He attributed the increase to a combination of greater demand for feed ingredients here and abroad but also to increased use of ethanol, which is made from corn. He said the spot price for processed turkey in September was $1.10 a pound, up 7 percent from the previous year.
While it would seem easy for farmers to raise prices for Thanksgiving -- what else are people going to eat? -- the market is not as inelastic as I thought. ''Just because your inputs go up, you can't just dump it on the consumer,'' Mr. Brokmeyer said. ''There's only a certain amount that people will pay for turkey.''
The price is also driven by contracts throughout the supply chain, with farmers, processors, distributors and stores.
Mary Pitman, of Mary's Turkeys in Fresno, Calif., which raises free-range, organic and heritage turkeys for stores and restaurants on the West Coast as well as some Whole Foods stores, said she negotiated the price of her turkeys in February and did not take into account the possibility of such an extreme spike in commodities prices. Her farm will lose money on turkeys this year.
IMPACT ON PRICE Most of the grocery stores and the large, commercial turkey producers I called did not want to discuss how they set their prices. One exception was Stew Leonard Jr., the president and chief executive of Stew Leonard's grocery stores in Connecticut.
He said he expected to make no money on the 1 million pounds of turkey he will sell for Thanksgiving. Where he makes money is on the side dishes that round out a Thanksgiving dinner.
He stocks a fresh bird for $1.49 a pound and one that is free of antibiotics and hormones for $2.79 a pound.
''What amazes me about Thanksgiving is here you have people squabbling over 99 cents a pound or 59 cents or $1.49,'' he said. ''Then they'll go over to the deli counter and buy Boar's Head sliced turkey that we sell for $7.99 a pound all year round, and they say, 'Wow, you're $7.99 and not $8.99.' ''
A different type of pricing model is in place for the boutique turkey market, one based on choice and the allure of something that is the food equivalent of a luxury car. Beagle Brodsky, the manager of Willie Bird Turkeys, a farm in Santa Rosa, Calif., that supplies turkeys to Williams-Sonoma, said the farm was gearing up for its annual overnight shipment. He said United Parcel Service would pick up 10,000 pounds of turkeys on Monday and deliver them all by Tuesday.
Williams-Sonoma charges $99.95 to $175 for these Willie Bird turkeys, plus $15 for shipping. Mr. Brodsky said annual sales of the birds were around 40,000, up by about 1,000 birds from last year.
While he said Willie Bird had been hurt by high commodities prices, he was more worried about the security of his turkeys, which roam 400 acres in the mountains of Sonoma County. ''We're trying to keep the mountain lions out of the large fields,'' he said.
Other distributors of high-end turkeys bristle at talk about price. Peter Martins, the founder of Heritage Foods USA, said it was unfair to compare heritage turkeys with frozen turkeys. ''There isn't a premium,'' he said. ''It's a fair price. No one believes that 99 cents a pound is the real cost.''
And he has many customers who agree with him. On Wednesday, he had only turkeys weighing eight to 10 pounds left, for $72 plus shipping. The 22-pound birds, priced at $148, were sold out.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? The difference between frozen and fresh is pretty obvious. A frozen turkey was probably killed sometime over the summer and has been sitting in a freezer since, while a fresh one was killed days before.
But as you go up the cost scale, the difference is clearly one of taste.
Ms. Pitman admitted that her heritage turkeys, all the rage among food connoisseurs, were not for everyone. ''You get a lot more thigh meat in my heritage turkey and less breast meat,'' she said. ''It's the original turkey flavor and it's a little chewier. They run and fly so they use their muscles more.''
She said her customers varied, from people of average means who love the gamey taste of heritage turkeys to a man who wanted to fly from Las Vegas in his private jet to pick one up.
Whatever the price, Thanksgiving dinner remains a relatively inexpensive meal.
The Arizona division of the Farm Bureau Federation published the cost of a traditional Thanksgiving meal in its state. To feed a family of 10 with a 16-pound frozen turkey -- priced at $21.28 -- with all the trimmings, the cost was $50.06, up 13 percent from last year.
For the first time, it also calculated the same meal with everything organic. The cost doubled to $106.03, with the bird alone costing $63.84. But that was still only $10.63 a person.

PERSON: Jon B. Lovelace 

HEADLINE: Jon Lovelace, 84, Mutual Fund Industry Leader

BYLINE: By ADRIENNE CARTER

 BODY:
Jon B. Lovelace, an early leader in the mutual fund industry who helped turn his firm, the Capital Group, into one of the largest money management companies in the nation, died on Wednesday at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 84. 
His family announced the death, saying he had been ill for some time.
Mr. Lovelace's father, Jonathan Bell Lovelace, founded the Capital Group in Los Angeles in 1931 during the Depression. He had pulled the bulk of his money out of the stock market not long before it crashed in 1929.
Jon Lovelace guided the firm as it expanded to rival giants like Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group. Today it oversees more than $1 trillion in more than 40 funds, selling them under the name American Funds.
Mr. Lovelace's unassuming nature infused much of the Capital Group's culture. The firm does not trumpet its returns publicly. It avoids trendy investment products in favor of a buy-and-hold philosophy. And its American Funds brand came to be known in the industry as ''the biggest money managers you've never heard of.''
''He embodied the culture,'' said James Rothenberg, the Capital Group's nonexecutive chairman.
Mr. Lovelace developed a flexible multimanager system that became the core of the firm's style. Rather than relying on an individual manager or a small team, the typical Capital Group fund has seven to nine managers, each of whom runs a piece of the portfolio.
The structure has allowed the Capital Group to avoid the fate of other firms that have suffered when they lost a star manager or received a sudden influx of money.
''In a world that's become very short-term-oriented, this is an investment organization that took a long-term view,'' said Don Phillips, the president of fund research for Morningstar.
Born in Detroit on Feb. 6, 1927, Jon Lovelace (the middle initial did not stand for a name) joined the Pacific Finance Company after graduating from Princeton University with an economics degree. He had to be persuaded to go into the family business. At the Capital Group, he started out as a statistician, taking on a more prominent role when his father fell ill. He was named chairman in 1964.
Asked about the key to success, Mr. Lovelace once said, ''Don't be greedy.''
Mr. Lovelace's philanthropic work mirrored his professional approach. He preferred to donate anonymously to organizations focused on the arts, the environment and education. He served as chairman of the J. Paul Getty Trust and was a founding trustee of the California Institute of the Arts.
Mr. Lovelace is survived by his wife, Lillian; a daughter, Carey; three sons, Jeffrey, Jim and Rob; and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Even a Powerhouse Is Losing Steam

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris writes about finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
SINCE the world economy hit bottom in early 2009, Germany has been the engine of growth in Europe. No major industrial economy -- in or out of Europe -- has grown as rapidly. But new figures released this week indicated that the German economy was growing at its slowest rate since the recovery began, and that much of Europe was no longer growing at all. 
In the second and third quarters of this year combined, Germany grew at an annual pace of just 1.6 percent. France, the second-largest economy in the euro zone, showed an annual rate of just 0.6 percent over the same six months.
Until recently, the euro zone seemed to be separated into three groups when it came to economic growth. Germany, and a few other Northern European countries, were doing the best, while economies in the peripheral countries were shrinking. In between were countries with moderate rates of growth.
But now it appears the in-between group is faltering, while the peripheral countries continue to struggle. In the third quarter, according to Eurostat, the European statistical agency, Belgium, which had been among the better performers, showed no growth at all. The same was true for Spain, and the Netherlands reported its real gross domestic product declined for the first time since 2009.
The accompanying charts show the change in gross domestic product figures for nine euro countries since the second quarter of 2009, as well as figures for the three largest industrial countries outside the bloc. Germany's economy is 7.6 percent larger than it was at the bottom, a growth rate more than twice that of France. There is as yet no third quarter estimate for Italy, but its growth rate was tepid even before its borrowing costs began to rise.
One of the few relative bright spots is Ireland, whose economy appears to be finally growing after years of austerity and deflation. But there is no sign of recovery in Portugal, and the Greek economy continues to decline. Greece is not shown in the chart because it is currently unable to produce seasonally adjusted statistics. But Eurostat estimates that the Greek economy was 5.2 percent smaller in the third quarter than it had been a year earlier.
In the early months of recovery, Germany may have benefited from its neighbors' weaknesses. Its companies were better positioned to export, both within Europe and outside it, thanks in part to Germany's having held down the growth in labor costs. The euro was also weaker than an independent German mark would have been, providing more help for German exports.
But now it appears that the weakness of its trading partners may be slowing Germany's economy, at the same time that borrowing costs are rising for those countries. A survey of German analysts this week showed investor expectations for the economy had fallen to the lowest levels since 2008.
The United States economy has grown 5.6 percent from the bottom, for an overall rate of 2.5 percent a year. That may seem good when compared with other countries, but by historical measures it is the weakest recovery since World War II. The economy grew 6.3 percent -- a 2.7 percent annual rate -- over the nine quarters following the 2001 economic bottom, in what had been the slowest pace until now.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Germany's Strong Recovery: Since the world economy hit bottom in 2009, Germany has mounted one of the strongest recoveries of any major country. But the rest of the euro zone has lagged. The charts show changes in real gross national product since the second quarter of 2009 of nine countries in the euro zone, as well as the three largest industrial nations not in it -- the United States, Britain and Japan.

HEADLINE: An Uprising With Plenty Of Potential

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
In the wake of this week's eviction of protesters from Zuccotti Park in New York and other urban campgrounds around the country, it's tempting to dismiss the Occupy Wall Street movement as little more than a short-lived media phenomenon. The issues that spawned the movement -- income inequality, money in politics and Wall Street's influence -- were being drowned out by debates over personal hygiene, noise and crime.
By Wednesday morning, when I dropped by the park, about 20 people, including some who looked disheveled and homeless, shared food and barely listened to a speaker with a graying ponytail who denounced New York as an ''illegitimate police state.'' Thursday's ''Day of Action'' led to some more arrests, but it didn't spawn the mass demonstrations some local politicians had predicted, let alone attract the throngs that the Tea Party mustered for a march on Washington in 2009. 
But critics and supporters alike suggest that the influence of the movement could last decades, and that it might even evolve into a more potent force. ''A lot of people brush off Occupy Wall Street as incoherent and inconsequential,'' Michael Prell told me. ''I disagree.''
Mr. Prell is a strategist for the Tea Party Patriots, a grass-roots organization that advocates Tea Party goals of fiscal responsibility, free markets and constitutionally limited government. He's the author of ''Underdogma,'' a critique of left-wing anti-Americanism, which includes a chapter on the Berkeley Free Speech movement of the 1960s, which may be the closest historical parallel to the Occupy movement.
''They claim to stand up on behalf of the 'little guy' (the 99 percent), while raising a fist of protest against the big, rich, greedy and powerful 1 percent,'' he said of the Occupy movement. ''The parallels between Occupy Wall Street and the Berkeley Free Speech Movement are too clear to ignore -- right down to the babbling incoherence of the participants. The lesson from Berkeley in the 1960s and the protest movement they spawned is: it doesn't matter that they don't make sense. What matters is they are tapping into a gut-level instinct that is alive, or lying dormant, in almost every human being. And, when they unleash the power of standing up for the powerless against the powerful -- David vs. Goliath -- the repercussions can ripple throughout our society for decades.''
Mr. Prell hopes that doesn't happen and is adamantly opposed to what he considers the movement's big government agenda, but points out that ''last generation's protesters are today's leaders.''
Sidney Tarrow, a visiting professor at the Cornell Law School, an expert in social movements and author of ''Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics,'' agreed that the movement could emerge as a more potent national force once the encampments were no longer an issue. This week's evictions ''could be the foundation for a national social movement,'' he said. The 1964 Sproul Hall sit-in at Berkeley ''created a communal basis for a future social movement. They hadn't met until they were carried out by police. That's a powerful solidarity-creating experience. We may well see networks of activists growing up because of this. People in the same encampments, and people in different encampments, are now in constant contact and can share experiences. They'll build a community. That's why occupation of space is important.''
Mr. Tarrow said he was sympathetic to the goals of the movement, ''and I'm especially pleased there's someone outside the Democratic Party establishment who's saying these things. Someone had to seriously open a debate about the yawning gap of inequality in this country.'' He added: ''My advice to them is, 'Move on.' The encampments were running out of steam. They've achieved the best they could hope to achieve, which is to draw the country's attention to extraordinary inequality. In my view, they should pack up their tents and march on Washington.''
Jeff Goodwin, a professor of sociology at New York University, who has both studied and at times joined the protesters, said he felt Mayor Bloomberg did the protesters ''a big favor. The attempt to disrupt or suppress the movement will backfire. People involved think this is just the beginning. People are having a conversation about what's wrong with the country. The police are not going to dissuade them from protesting or remaining active. It's just going to anger people and radicalize them, and maybe draw new people into the conversation.''
While Occupy Wall Street has caught the attention of the White House and shifted the national debate over the economy, much as the Tea Party movement did from a conservative and libertarian perspective, it hasn't yet had anywhere near the Tea Party's impact, and it hasn't elected any political candidates or raised significant funds. But it may have less conventional goals.
Cornel West, a Princeton professor who has emerged as a prominent voice of the movement, called me from Seattle, where he'd just joined Occupy Seattle protesters at Seattle Central Community College, and was en route to Oakland to participate in more protests there. ''We've got to regroup and bounce back,'' he said of this week's evictions. ''There's already been a victory. Everyone is talking about corporate greed and income inequality, and that wouldn't have been imaginable even a year ago.'' He added, ''To think that New York City spent all of that taxpayer money on policing the protesters and arresting people, while right there on Wall Street are all these financial criminals and no one has been charged. The oligarchs get away with everything. The hypocrisy is just too much to take. The shift towards truth and justice is what the movement is all about.''
Mr. West said he didn't know where the movement was headed, but ''you can't evict an idea whose time has come.''

HEADLINE: Older, Suburban and Struggling, 'Near Poor' Startle the Census

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, ROBERT GEBELOFF and SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- They drive cars, but seldom new ones. They earn paychecks, but not big ones. Many own homes. Most pay taxes. Half are married, and nearly half live in the suburbs. None are poor, but many describe themselves as barely scraping by.
Down but not quite out, these Americans form a diverse group sometimes called ''near poor'' and sometimes simply overlooked -- and a new count suggests they are far more numerous than previously understood.
When the Census Bureau this month released a new measure of poverty, meant to better count disposable income, it began altering the portrait of national need. Perhaps the most startling differences between the old measure and the new involves data the government has not yet published, showing 51 million people with incomes less than 50 percent above the poverty line. That number of Americans is 76 percent higher than the official account, published in September. All told, that places 100 million people -- one in three Americans -- either in poverty or in the fretful zone just above it. 
After a lost decade of flat wages and the worst downturn since the Great Depression, the findings can be thought of as putting numbers to the bleak national mood -- quantifying the expressions of unease erupting in protests and political swings. They convey levels of economic stress sharply felt but until now hard to measure.
The Census Bureau, which published the poverty data two weeks ago, produced the analysis of those with somewhat higher income at the request of The New York Times. The size of the near-poor population took even the bureau's number crunchers by surprise.
''These numbers are higher than we anticipated,'' said Trudi J. Renwick, the bureau's chief poverty statistician. ''There are more people struggling than the official numbers show.''
Outside the bureau, skeptics of the new measure warned that the phrase ''near poor'' -- a common term, but not one the government officially uses -- may suggest more hardship than most families in this income level experience. A family of four can fall into this range, adjusted for regional living costs, with an income of up to $25,500 in rural North Dakota or $51,000 in Silicon Valley.
But most economists called the new measure better than the old, and many said the findings, while disturbing, comported with what was previously known about stagnant wages.
''It's very consistent with everything we've been hearing in the last few years about families' struggle, earnings not keeping up for the bottom half,'' said Sheila Zedlewski, a researcher at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social research group.
Patched together a half-century ago, the official poverty measure has long been seen as flawed. It ignores hundreds of billions the needy receive in food stamps, tax credits and other programs, and the similarly large sums paid in taxes, medical care and work expenses. The new method, called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, counts all those factors and adjusts for differences in the cost of living, which the official measure ignores.
The results scrambled the picture of poverty in many surprising ways. The measure shows less severe destitution, but a bit more overall poverty; fewer poor children, but more poor people over 65.
Of the 51 million who appear near poor under the fuller measure, nearly 20 percent were lifted up from poverty by benefits the official count overlooks. But more than half were pushed down from higher income levels: more than eight million by taxes, six million by medical expenses, and four million by work expenses like transportation and child care.
Demographically, they look more like ''The Brady Bunch'' than ''The Wire.'' Half live in households headed by a married couple; 49 percent live in the suburbs. Nearly half are non-Hispanic white, 18 percent are black and 26 percent are Latino.
Perhaps the most surprising finding is that 28 percent work full-time, year round. ''These estimates defy the stereotypes of low-income families,'' Ms. Renwick said.
Among them is Phyllis Pendleton, a social worker with Catholic Charities in Washington, who proudly displays the signs of a hard-won middle-class life. She has one BlackBerry and two cars (both Buicks from the 1990s), and a $230,000 house that she, her husband and two daughters will move into next week.
Combined, she and her husband, a janitor, make about $51,000 a year, more than 200 percent of the official poverty line. But they lose about a fifth to taxes, medical care and transportation to work -- giving them a disposable income of about $40,000 a year.
Adjust the poverty threshold, as the new measure does, to $31,000 for the region's high cost of living, and Ms. Pendleton's income is 29 percent above the poverty line. That is to say, she is near poor.
While the phrase is new to her, the struggle it evokes is not.
''Living paycheck to paycheck,'' is how she describes her survival strategy. ''One bad bill will wipe you out.''
It took her three years to save $3,000 for the down payment on her house, which she got with subsidies from a nonprofit group, Capital Area Asset Builders. But even after cutting out meals at Red Lobster, movie nights and new clothes, she had to rely on government aid to get health insurance for her daughters, 11 and 13, and she is already worried about college tuition.
''I'm turning over every rock looking for scholarships,'' she said. ''The money's out there, you just have to find it.''
The findings, which the Census Bureau plans to release on Monday, have already set off a contentious debate about how to describe such families: struggling, straitened, economically insecure?
Robert Rector, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, rejects the phrase ''near poverty,'' arguing that it conjures levels of dire need like hunger and homelessness experienced by a minority even among those actually poor.
''I don't have any objection to this measure if you use the term 'low-income,' '' he said. ''But the emotionally charged terms 'poor' or 'near poor' clearly suggest to most people a level of material hardship that doesn't exist. It is deliberately used to mislead people.''
Bruce Meyer, an economist at the University of Chicago, warned that the numbers are likely to mask considerable diversity. Some households, especially the elderly, may have considerable savings. (Indeed, nearly one in five of the near poor own their homes mortgage-free.) But others may be getting help with public housing and food stamps.
''I do think this is a better measure, but I wouldn't say that 100 million people are on the edge of starvation or anything close to that,'' Mr. Meyer said.
But Ms. Zedlewski said the seeming ordinariness of these families is part of the point. ''There are a lot of low-income Americans struggling to make ends meet, and we don't pay enough attention to them,'' she said.
One group likely to gain attention is older Americans. By the official count, only 22 percent of the elderly are either poor or near poor. By the alternate count, the figure rises to 34 percent.
That is still less than the share among children, 39 percent, but it erases about half the gap between the economic fortunes of the young and old recorded in the official count. The likeliest explanation is high medical costs.
Another surprising finding is that only a quarter of the near poor are insured, and 42 percent have private insurance. Indeed, the cost of paying the premiums is part of the previously uncounted expenses they bear.
Belinda Sheppard's finances have been so battered in the past year, she finds herself wondering what storm will come next. Her adult daughter lost her job and moved in. Her adult son does not have one and cannot move out.
That leaves three adults getting by on $46,000 from her daughter's unemployment check and the money Ms. Sheppard makes for a marketing firm, placing products in grocery stores. Take out $7,000 for taxes, transportation and medical care, and they have an income of about 130 percent of the poverty line -- not poor, but close.
Ms. Sheppard pays $2,000 in rent and says her employer classifies her as part time to avoid offering her health insurance, even though she works 40 hours a week. Unable to buy it on her own, she crosses her fingers and tries to stay healthy.
''I try to work as many hours as I can, but my salary, it's not enough for everything,'' she said. ''I pay my bills with very small wiggle room. Or none.''

HEADLINE: Honk if You Agree There Is a Difference Between Free Speech and Noise

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DENVER -- Horn-honking, as a statement of frustration or joy or who knows what behind the wheel, has been part of the American fabric since the first Ah-OO-gah from the first Model A.
But Occupy Wall Street is giving it a new twist. 
What, for example, is a person really doing when honking while driving by a sidewalk protest in Denver, or any other city where ''honk and wave'' has become a kind of social compact between protesters and the public?
Is it noise -- and therefore a public nuisance -- or protected free speech in support, or perhaps sometimes condemnation, of the protesters? Does it matter whether the sound comes in a tentative tapping toot or a hard laying on of the palm in full drive-by blare, or during the night when people are trying to sleep?
The police in Denver and Seattle, at least, have issued tickets in recent weeks to some drive-by honkers at protest sites. But Washington State's highest court, coincidentally, also weighed in last month on honking, saying that intent was crucial in deciding whether it was a voiceless commentary, and thus protected, or an annoying intrusion worthy of an officer's citation book.
''While it does not involve spoken words, horn honking may be clearly a form of expressive conduct,'' the court said in reversing the conviction of a woman who was charged with violating a local noise ordinance by blasting her horn outside a neighbor's house.
Aaron Pelley, a Seattle lawyer who has been representing ticketed horn-honkers pro bono in support of the Occupy effort, said that even though the court case did not specifically involve the protests, the police there had largely backed down in issuing summons since the ruling.
A spokesman for the Denver Police Department, Detective John White, said he believed the number of honking citations remained very small. ''There is no concentrated effort,'' he said.
Legal scholars say the line between making a point and making a pointless ruckus has never been very clear. Courts have held, for example, that nude dancing in bars can be a protected form of expression, but that nude sunbathing is generally not. The ''no-call'' solicitation rules that allow people to bar telemarketing pitches also tread the line between the right to speak and the right not to be spoken to.
The psychology of the honk itself is deep stuff, too. Researchers have found, for example, that status plays a role -- a cheap old car blocking an intersection provokes honks faster and more vociferously than a new luxury sedan. People honk more in hotter weather, or so a study in Phoenix found.
And behind all of it, society increasingly communicates with fewer words. A treatise becomes a Tweet, a speech a bumper sticker. An opinion can be rendered by a :) or a :( or the click of a ''like'' button. In the car world, honks have even been incorporated in deliberate brand-building efforts -- commercial free speech -- in encouraging Saab owners, for example, to greet one another with a honk and flash of lights.
''A horn is just a horn -- realistically it's not very articulate,'' said R. George Wright, a professor at the Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis who has written widely about nonverbal communication and the law. ''But free speech doesn't require articulateness -- you don't have to be Tom Paine, as long as what you do can be perceived by an audience as having a message,'' he said.
The case in Washington, by the way, did not involve grand political issues about economic equity and the future of American society, but rather, chickens.
The woman at the center of that case, Helen D. Immelt, had been raising chickens in Snohomish County, Wash., apparently in violation of her local homeowners association covenants. A neighbor complained, and Ms. Immelt, according to court documents, drove over at 6 a.m. and applied some free-speech payback.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans New Sanctions Against Iran's Oil Industry

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ALAN COWELL; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Alan Cowell from London.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration plans to impose a new round of sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry, a Western official briefed on the plans said Friday, less than two weeks after a United Nations report published evidence that the Iranian government was working on a nuclear weapon.
The sanctions, expected to be announced on Monday, build on existing measures against Iran's oil and gas industry, which aim to curb foreign investment in refineries or other facilities. European nations are expected to announce similar measures when their leaders meet later in the week, the official said. 
The sanctions come after the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, rebuked Tehran on Friday, but stopped short of threatening further pressure or actions to curb its contentious uranium enrichment program.
In the wake of the report, the United States has been working to build international support for new sanctions. Much of its focus has been on cutting off the Iranian central bank or placing further curbs on the petroleum industry.
But there are hurdles to sanctioning Iran's central bank, because China, Japan and other countries rely on it to process transactions for purchases of oil. The White House is also reluctant to undertake measures that could lead to spikes in oil prices and rattle a fragile American economy.
While the details of the new sanctions were sketchy -- and the Treasury Department declined to comment -- the official said they were focused more on investments in Iran's petrochemical industry than on cutting off sales of oil, which could disrupt the market.
Meanwhile, the criticism from the nuclear agency drew an immediate and sharp response from Iran, which maintains that the evidence for the agency's report was fabricated by enemies of the Islamic Republic. An Iranian envoy insisted that his country would not be deterred ''for a second'' from a nuclear program it says is for peaceful purposes. The diplomat also said Iran would boycott a planned meeting next week of Middle Eastern countries, called to discuss ways of freeing the world of nuclear weapons.
The exchanges came at the end of a two-day closed meeting of the 35-member board of governors of the atomic energy agency at its headquarters in Vienna. The agency's report last week drew on a vast trove of evidence to conclude that there was a ''credible'' case that Iran engaged in secret and possibly continuing efforts to construct a nuclear weapon.
The concluding resolution, approved overwhelmingly, did not refer to punitive measures against Iran, or send the matter to the Security Council for action, reflecting the diplomatic balance between Western powers eager to crank up pressure on Iran and two leading powers in the diplomacy, Russia and China, that have adopted a milder line.
The resolution expressed ''deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program,'' and urged Iran to return to talks and restrain its nuclear work as outlined by prior Security Council resolutions. The board approved the statement by 32 to 2, with Cuba and Ecuador opposing it and Indonesia abstaining.
The resolution did not set deadlines for Iran to comply with the agency's demand for access to nuclear sites for its inspectors and greater openness about the country's nuclear program.
In a statement, the White House welcomed the agency's sharp criticism of Iran, emphasizing the completeness of the case against Iran made by the agency's report. ''The Director General's report and today's action by the Board of Governors expose once and for all the hollowness of Iran's claims, and reinforce the world's demands that Iran come clean and live up to its international obligations,'' the statement said.
The Iranian envoy to the agency, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said his country would not halt uranium enrichment for even ''a second,'' Reuters reported, after having earlier dismissed the resolution's mandates as ''not legally binding, thus they are not applicable.''
Mr. Soltanieh said his country would not participate in the planned gathering next week, under the agency's auspices, of Middle Eastern countries, likely to include Israel and Arab states.
Western powers that have long pressed for Iran to halt its nuclear enrichment program -- the United States, Britain, France and Germany -- appear to have been unable to use the unexpectedly strong agency report to create a consensus for stronger action. Instead, the relatively mild resolution reflected lengthy and intense diplomatic wrangling with Russia and China, the other countries most directly involved.
Earlier, Mr. Soltanieh accused the nuclear agency of endangering the lives of Iranian scientists by releasing their names in an annex to last week's report about the suspicions of nuclear weapons work.
''The release of the names of the Iranian nuclear scientists by the agency has made them targets for assassination by terrorist groups as well as the Israeli regime and the U.S. intelligence services,'' he said in a letter to the body's director general, Yukiya Amano.
Parts of the letter were published by Iran's state-financed Press TV satellite broadcaster, which noted that several Iranian nuclear scientists had been killed in incidents attributed by Iran to Israeli, British and American intelligence services.
Mr. Soltanieh contended that disclosing the names of Iranian experts represented a violation of the agency's rules and said Tehran reserved the right to seek damages from the agency for any harm to its personnel or property as a result of the report -- a possible reference to Tehran's frequently voiced fears of an Israeli military strike on its nuclear facilities.
The agency's report has amplified talk of a potential Israeli attack, a move that Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said last week would have a ''serious impact'' on the Middle East and possibly on American forces in the region, without seriously disrupting Iran's nuclear program.
On Friday, Mr. Panetta planned to meet Ehud Barak, his Israeli counterpart, and indicated that he would speak of potential ''unintended consequences'' from a military strike. He was speaking to reporters traveling with him to a security forum in Canada, where he is to meet with Mr. Barak.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles County Officials Restart '81 Inquiry in Actress's Death

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
MONTEREY PARK, Calif. - The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said on Friday that it had reopened its investigation into the actress Natalie Wood's death 30 years ago because of new information from multiple sources.
''Recently, we received information which we felt was substantial enough'' to reopen the case, Lt. John Corina of the Sheriff's Department said at a morning news conference here. 
Ms. Wood's death, on Nov. 29, 1981, in the waters off Santa Catalina Island, has persisted as a subject of Hollywood fascination. She had been staying on the yacht Splendour along with her husband, Robert Wagner, the actor Christopher Walken, and Dennis Davern, the boat's captain.
Lieutenant Corina said that Mr. Wagner was not a suspect.
Her death was ruled an accidental drowning, but has produced persistent speculation that was fed last year by a tell-all book, ''Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour,'' written by Mr. Davern and a co-author, Marti Rulli.
In the book, the authors described fierce arguments among those on the boat. In a Friday morning appearance on the ''Today'' show, Mr. Davern said he had earlier lied to authorities about what happened on the Splendour, and had urged the sheriff to reopen the case.
The sudden attention coincides with the approaching 30-year anniversary of Ms. Wood's death, and a planned re-examination of the case on the CBS true-crime show ''48 Hours Mystery,'' which on Saturday is scheduled to broadcast an episode based in part on an article that was published by Vanity Fair in 2000.
The Los Angeles Times reported in its Friday editions that the case would be re-examined.
At Friday's news conference, Lieutenant Corina repeatedly told dozens of assembled reporters and media crew members that Ms. Wood's death had been ruled an accident, and would still be considered so unless the renewed investigation turned up contrary evidence.
He declined to describe what information had led the Sheriff's Department to reopen the case, or to say who had provided it.

He said investigators had not contacted Mr. Wagner about the renewed investigation, though, in response to a question, he said it would be standard procedure to tell Mr. Wagner, as Wood's survivor, that the case was open again. Asked whether Mr. Wagner was suspected of wrongdoing, Mr. Corina said, ''No.''
Alan Nierob, a spokesman for Mr. Wagner, said in a statement: ''Although no one in the Wagner family has heard from the L.A. County Sheriff's Department about this matter, they fully support the efforts'' to reach clarity about the death.
Lieutenant Corina declined to say whether Mr. Davern might face penalties for having earlier misled the authorities, but he said prosecution for impeding an investigation with false information was hypothetically possible. At one point, he said investigators planned to look again at the yacht, which is in Hawaii, but offered few other details in the course of the 10-minute appearance before the press.
At the time of her death, Ms. Wood, who was 43, was filming a movie, ''Brainstorm,'' that co-starred Mr. Walken, and was seen as something of a comeback vehicle for an actress whose most noted performances had occurred years before.
Wood was three times nominated for acting Oscars, though she never won. Her last nomination, in 1964, was for her lead role in ''Love With the Proper Stranger.''
On the night of her death, she disappeared from the Splendour (one of her signature roles was in the film ''Splendor in the Grass''), along with an inflatable boat. Her body was found some distance from where the Splendour was anchored, and the Los Angeles County coroner, Dr. Thomas T. Noguchi, said her injuries were consistent with drowning, perhaps after being hurt in a fall from the yacht.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the reopening of the investigation into the death of the actress Natalie Wood after 30 years referred imprecisely to the status of the movie she was making at the time. Though Ms. Wood had finished filming her scenes in the film, ''Brainstorm,'' the movie itself was still in production; it had not been completed.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 8-Day Trip Emphasizes Role Of Pacific Rim in U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Ian Johnson contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
BALI, Indonesia -- President Obama discussed maritime security, nuclear nonproliferation and disaster aid at an Asian summit meeting on Friday, but just his presence on this resort island telegraphed his main message: that the United States is turning its focus to the booming Asia-Pacific region after a decade of preoccupation with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Calling the region critical to economic growth and national security, he said, ''I want everyone to know from the outset, my administration is committed to strengthening our ties with each country individually but also with the region's institutions.'' 
The American focus on Asia has been raising tensions with an ever more powerful China, which has been increasingly assertive in the region. On Saturday morning Mr. Obama held a previously unscheduled meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China. Administration officials said Mr. Obama and Mr. Wen talked briefly on Friday night at a dinner for the gathered leaders and agreed to meet the next morning. Earlier on Friday, Mr. Wen had pushed back against the United States, saying that ''outside forces should not, under any pretext'' interfere in a regional fight over the control of the South China Sea.
Mr. Obama spoke Friday at the opening of the annual meeting of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which does not include China. Before that session, he met separately with the leaders of India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
On Saturday, Mr. Obama became the first American president to participate at the larger East Asia Summit meeting, which does include China as well as Russia, India and Japan, before he was scheduled to return to Washington after eight days of Pacific Rim diplomacy.
The summit meeting on Friday was eclipsed by news of a diplomatic opening between the United States and Myanmar now that its military has loosened its chokehold on freedoms there. Mr. Obama said that he was sending Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to Myanmar, also known as Burma, to test its government's sincerity about democratic reforms and human rights.
The countries along the South China Sea have been especially eager for the United States to increase its presence in the region as a check on China's ambitions.
Mr. Obama's trip has been something of a balancing act in which he is trying to meld geopolitics and domestic concerns.
Up to the time of his departure from Washington, there was speculation that Mr. Obama would skip the Indonesia trip, given the political risks of being away from the United States during a time of high unemployment and discontent over the economy.
Against that backdrop, Mr. Obama has sought throughout his travels from Hawaii -- where he played host to an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation free trade forum -- to Australia and Indonesia to describe his trip in terms of its potential to create American jobs by expanding exports.
To that end, he attended a signing ceremony at which representatives of Boeing and Lion Air, Indonesia's largest private airline, signed a deal for Lion Air to buy 230 aircraft, an agreement worth $22 billion at current list prices.
Mr. Obama said the deal was ''a remarkable example of the trade investment and commercial opportunities that exist in the Asia-Pacific region.''
Mr. Obama said his administration and the United States Export-Import Bank ''were critical in facilitating this deal,'' which he estimated would result in more than 100,000 American jobs over a period of years.
Domestic politics also had a bit role in Mr. Obama's meetings with Asian leaders, including President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia. With Mr. Yudhoyono, Mr. Obama announced the transfer and upgrade of 24 excess F-16 fighters to the Indonesian Air Force, reflecting, he said, a commitment to the region's security, and an expansion of Peace Corps volunteers and exchanges for education and environmental programs.
In remarks at his separate sessions with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India and the president of the Philippines, Benigno S. Aquino III, Mr. Obama praised the contributions of Indian-Americans and Filipino-Americans to the United States.
After the meeting, Mr. Singh turned to Mr. Obama and called it ''a privilege'' to have the Obama administration so ''deeply invested in ensuring that India makes a success of its historic journey'' to establish a more open society. He added that cooperation on civilian nuclear programs, disaster response and maritime security ''unite us in our quest of a world free from the threat of war, want and exploitation.''
In Mr. Obama's meeting with Mr. Aquino, he commended the Filipino president ''for his leadership, for his reform efforts.'' Mr. Aquino said, ''We look forward, in these turbulent times of ours, to really further strengthen our relationship.''

HEADLINE: Tax Pledge May Scuttle A Deal On Deficit

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Three-quarters of Americans -- including more than half of Republicans -- say they believe that any deficit reduction plan should include tax increases, according to a recent New York Times/CBS poll. But Congressional Republicans are not so sure.
Republicans on the deficit-reduction supercommittee have offered a deal with 24 cents of every dollar in savings coming from tax increases, and the other 76 cents from spending cuts. That's less from taxes than recommended by the leaders of last year's blue ribbon panel on deficit reduction, which proposed 30 cents and 70 cents.
The latest proposal, even if agreed to by the committee, might have trouble surviving the full Republican caucus. Nearly every Republican in Congress has signed a pledge never to raise taxes, regardless of how much red ink is on the country's balance sheet.
But previous Congressional budget deals relied significantly more on taxes than anything on the table now. 
In the five fiscal grand bargains of the 1980s and early 1990s, tax increases accounted for an average of 61 cents of every dollar saved. In fact, in President Reagan's 1982 and 1984 budget-trimming deals, more than 80 percent of deficit reductions came from tax increases. What's more, the deals passed with majority support from both parties. Mr. Reagan may be remembered as an antitax hero, but he actually raised taxes 11 times over the course of his presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility.
Republicans used to rank deficit reduction ahead of curbing taxes, but now the reverse is true. What changed?
The conventional wisdom is that Republicans became fiercely antitax because President George H. W. Bush lost his 1992 re-election bid after breaking his ''no new taxes'' pledge.
But the evolution most likely began much earlier -- in the 1970s, when a few conservative thinkers proposed a few exciting ideas that helped reconcile tax cuts with budget balancing.
In 1974, Arthur B. Laffer, a supply-side economist at the University of Chicago, doodled his now-famous Laffer curve, which showed that tax cuts could, counterintuitively, narrow deficits: lower tax rates encouraged people to earn more money, thereby creating more income that could be taxed, thereby raising total tax revenue. A related but somewhat contradictory supply-side theory was the starve the beast argument, which posited that tax rate cuts would lead to lower total tax revenue, forcing spending cuts and then balancing the budget from both sides of the ledger.
And then there was the Two Santa Claus Theory, advocated by Jude Wanniski, a Wall Street Journal editorial writer. In an influential 1976 essay, he argued that tax cuts were not only good for the economy, but politically endearing.
Republicans, he argued, should stop playing Scrooge to the Democrats' generous Santa Claus. Instead, he said the party could offer its own Christmas gift to voters: tax cuts.
Those messages filtered through, and energized younger Republicans over the next decade. But Congress still had a number of the old guard, more moderate and budget-hawkish Republicans, like Bob Dole and Howard Baker, who encouraged compromise on fiscal issues.
''There was a different makeup of the United States Congress then than there is now,'' said G. William Hoagland, vice president for federal affairs at Cigna Insurance who has worked for the Congressional Budget Office and for Senator Bill Frist, the former Republican Senate majority leader. ''There was much more willingness to reach across the aisle in a bipartisan manner for the good of the country as opposed to the next election.''
Slowly, the Republican old guard was replaced. And with each subsequent budget bargain, more and more Republicans jumped from the antideficit bandwagon to the antitax one, egged on by conservative groups.
Most prominent was Americans for Tax Reform, an organization founded by Grover Norquist. In 1986, the new group began asking politicians to sign a pledge against tax increases. That first year, 100 representatives and 20 senators signed on. By 1994, Mr. Norquist says, the number of signatories had risen to 200 representatives and about 50 senators; today 238 representatives and 41 senators have signed the pledge.
Not coincidentally, President Reagan's fiscal consolidation deal, from a 1987 budget summit meeting, passed without a majority of Republican votes.
Even the budget hawks were coming around. In the next presidential election, George H. W. Bush, who had once derided supply-side theory as ''voodoo economics,'' told voters to ''read my lips: no new taxes.'' It was a winning message.
Just two years later, though, he was ruffled by the mounting federal debt and urged Congress to pass a deficit reduction bill that included tax increases.
Initially, conservative Republicans killed the bill, led by Newt Gingrich, a rising star and antitax leader. After a three-day government shutdown, the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act finally passed. But it, too, passed without a majority of Republicans voting for it.
Voters kicked Mr. Bush out of office in the next election, but political scientists debate whether his 1990 tax increase was to blame. President Reagan, after all, somehow remained phenomenally popular despite raising taxes nearly a dozen times.
The first President Bush also had to contend with a weak economy and public anger for a broken promise, regardless of the promise's content, said Sarah A. Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University.
Either way, Republicans saw Mr. Bush's loss as a rallying cry.
''In the 1980s, the opposition to the Soviet Union and communism was the core of the Republican brand, helping unify Republicans from all sorts of other different beliefs,'' said Eric M. Patashnik, a public policy professor at the University of Virginia. ''After the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union, the opposition to tax increases became the glue that held together the Republican Party.''
Accordingly, every single Republican voted against President Clinton's tax-heavy deficit reduction plan in 1993. The Republican platform in the next federal election was explicitly antitax, and successfully ended the Democrats' 40-year Congressional majority. Some experts believe that historical political changeover also hardened Republicans against tax increases.
''Through the 1950s to the 1980s, the Democrats were seen as the 'natural' majority party in Congress, and the question of the next election was less on people's minds,'' said Frances E. Lee, a professor of politics and government at the University of Maryland. ''It was easier to contemplate political risks when the stakes were lower.'' After the majority appeared more volatile, she said, ''suddenly it became much harder to do a deal that imposes painful tax hikes.''
In 1997, Congress passed a two-part deficit reduction package containing nothing but spending cuts. In fact, it could be said it cut more than spending, since the new laws cut taxes, too.
Over the last 30 years, Americans have made the opposite transition. In a 1982 NBC News/Associated Press poll, 77 percent said deficits should be reduced by spending cuts alone, about the same share that now want some tax increases.
Experts don't know how to explain this, but say it could reflect today's lower tax rates: in 1982 the top rate was 50 percent and now it is 35 percent.
''Sometimes it's not the attitudes that change,'' said Morris P. Fiorina, a Stanford political science professor and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. ''It's the facts.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Economic Memo article on Saturday about the roots of a Republican pledge to curb taxes misstated the length of a government shutdown in 1990 stemming from partisan disagreement over budget issues. It was three days, not three weeks. (A later shutdown straddling 1995 and 1996 lasted three weeks.)

HEADLINE: Myanmar Reforms Seem Real, but Ethnic Strife and Poverty Could Undercut Them

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- From dictatorship to quasi democracy in less than a year, the pace of change in Myanmar has stunned even the most cynical observers of the country.
The decision by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to rejoin the country's military-backed political system has offered a veneer of legitimacy for the reform efforts of President Thein Sein.
The changes appear real, analysts say: the government's courting of the opposition, the release of some political prisoners, the rewriting of hundreds of laws, the easing of some restrictions on the news media. But there is no telling if they are permanent. 
Mr. Thein Sein has a ''critical one-year window'' to show that this liberalization can work, said Thant Myint-U, a historian, former United Nations official and one of the leading experts on the country.
Myanmar remains beset by grinding poverty and economic dysfunction. Many parts of the country are not at peace. Ethnic groups and their large and well-equipped armies regularly clash with government troops along the borders with China and Thailand, areas that produce vast quantities of heroin and methamphetamines sold across Asia.
''It's increasingly easy to be very optimistic at this point, to imagine the further release of political prisoners, Aung San Suu Kyi entering Parliament and free and fair elections,'' Mr. Thant Myint-U said, referring to the 1991 Nobel laureate who was released from house arrest last year. ''It's far harder to be optimistic about the economy. There's no proper judicial system. There's no proper banking system, no system to help finance economic growth, where businesses can go get a loan.''
President Obama, in Bali, Indonesia, attending a summit meeting of Pacific Rim countries, said Friday that ''of course there's far more to be done'' in Myanmar.
''For decades Americans have been deeply concerned about the denial of basic human rights for the Burmese people,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The persecution of democratic reformers, the brutality shown toward ethnic minorities and the concentration of power in the hands of a few military leaders has challenged our conscience and isolated Burma from the United States and much of the world.''
But he added that ''after years of darkness, we've seen flickers of progress in these last several weeks.''
Political harmony in the country may to some degree now depend on whether the detente between Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and the military-backed government lasts.
During the coming months, the government faces a potential backlash from business tycoons who made their fortunes in the old political system and from elements in the military uncomfortable with the overtures to the opposition.
Above all, perhaps, the country faces huge challenges in fixing its economy, especially in the realm of banking and finance.
There are no mortgages in Myanmar, and banks are barred from lending for terms of more than one year. Private banks are forbidden to lend to farmers, who make up 70 percent of the population of 55 million people.
The only readily available credit is from informal money lenders, who charge around 180 percent interest per year, according to Sean Turnell, a professor at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and a leading expert on Myanmar's economy.
Professor Turnell says the country faces a transition to a market economy similar to what former Eastern European countries experienced after the fall of the Soviet Union. ''They are starting with a blank sheet,'' Professor Turnell said. The government's tone and talk have ''changed dramatically,'' but the reform process will be ''strewn with crises.''
Billions of dollars' worth of revenues from the government's sales of natural gas have been ''squirreled away,'' he said, and the country has not published a full government budget in many decades. ''There are many theories about where the money is,'' Professor Turnell said.

HEADLINE: Niche Voters Giving Paul Momentum In Iowa Polls

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
VINTON, Iowa -- Steve and Cindy Anders belong to one of Iowa's most politically savvy movements -- Christian home-schoolers, whose organizing on behalf of Mike Huckabee in 2008 was one of the secrets behind his upset victory in the state's Republican caucus.
This year, the Anderses are behind Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who supports drastically shrinking the federal government and closing the Education Department.
In a year when the Republican field is unusually fractured, with front-runners coming around as often as carousel ponies, Mr. Paul's ability to mobilize niche groups like home-schoolers may make a big difference. His campaign, which has won a number of straw polls and is picking up momentum, has demonstrated its ability to organize and mobilize supporters, which is particularly relevant in Iowa, where relatively small numbers can tip the scales in the caucuses. 
For his part, Mr. Anders was looking forward to a meeting with a Paul campaign staff member to strategize ''how we can go to work for Ron Paul.''
''Home-schoolers are really independently minded,'' Mr. Anders said, estimating that most of the 10 other families in his Saturday morning coffee club in Council Bluffs, Iowa, supported Mr. Paul. ''He believes the federal government has no role in education, as most home-schoolers will agree.''
Home-school families are among the lesser-known converts to Mr. Paul -- along with small-business owners and voters well past college age -- who have helped him build support beyond his fierce core of followers, often young people.
His support has usually added up to less than 10 percent in surveys of likely Republican primary voters.
But now, thanks to the best organized grass-roots campaign in Iowa and heavy spending on television advertisements that portray him as consistent while other Republicans have flip-flopped, Mr. Paul is breaking through that ceiling, giving rise to a once far-fetched scenario -- that he might win the state's caucuses on Jan. 3.
''I'm buying Ron Paul today,'' said Craig Robinson, a former political director for the Republican Party of Iowa, who on Wednesday sent a Twitter message saying, ''Ron Paul's Iowa Campaign Office was abuzz at 8 p.m. tonight when I drove by on my way to the bank. Impressive.''
Two state polls this week show him in a statistical tie for first. One, released Monday by Bloomberg News, showed Mr. Paul winning 19 percent of likely Republican caucus voters, within the margin of error with Herman Cain, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich.
The Bloomberg poll showed that about two-thirds of Iowa respondents had been contacted by the Paul campaign by phone, e-mail or a knock on the door, more outreach than any other candidate.
''We've been out-hustling the other campaigns,'' said Jesse Benton, Mr. Paul's national campaign manager.
Because of strong fund-raising from small donors on the Internet, the campaign has been able to saturate the Iowa airwaves with ads. It has outspent all others -- $2.5 million on TV and radio commercials in Iowa and New Hampshire (where a Bloomberg poll had Mr. Paul in second place this week behind Mr. Romney). It plans to spend $4 million more before the voting in those two states begins in less than two months.
The ads highlight Mr. Paul's message of deep cuts to government spending and conveniently avoid his isolationist foreign policy, which risks turning off undecided voters.
Chuck Walsh, who works for his family's G.M.-Toyota dealership in Carroll, Iowa, is a recent convert to Mr. Paul.
''I don't think I was his core type, the young college type,'' said Mr. Walsh, 42, a volunteer firefighter and veteran of the Persian Gulf war. He voted for Mr. Romney in 2008 and was leaning toward him again this year, but he changed his mind because the federal government, he said, needs more drastic cuts than Mr. Romney proposes.
Mr. Walsh felt squeamish coming out as a Paul supporter. ''The reaction is, 'Oh, the guy is fringe, he's crazy,' '' he said. ''People tell me, 'You're throwing away your vote.' I said to myself: 'Chuck, you wore the uniform, you fought for the right to vote. If you're voting with your heart, I don't think you're throwing away your vote.' ''
In making his third run for the presidency, Mr. Paul, 76, has benefited from the splitting of the social conservative vote in Iowa among a number of candidates, and from the fact that this year jobs and the economy trump concerns over abortion and same-sex marriage.
Four years ago, Mr. Paul stumped around the state, warning that the country was heading for financial calamity because of Washington's overspending. This year he appears in the same hotel ballrooms, and many regard his message as having been prescient.
But even as he picks up support, very few independent strategists see a path for him to the Republican nomination.
''I don't think he's going to be the nominee,'' said Steve Roberts, a former chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa. ''But he's certainly in a rarefied atmosphere for him.''
Tim Albrecht, a top aide to Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, said, ''His biggest hurdle is his foreign policy piece.''
''I figured he'd get 16 percent in the caucuses,'' Mr. Albrecht added. ''Right now he's polling around 20 percent. That's enough to be in the hunt this year because it's so splintered and wide open. But he's got to continue expanding his message to collect more voters.''
At an event at the Pizza Ranch in Vinton, Iowa, on Friday, the 40 or so voters who came to hear Mr. Paul speak were a cross-section of his core supporters and curious newcomers. The faithful sported their ''Ron Paul Revolution'' caps and T-shirts.
Lynn Rinderknecht, an organic farmer, said, ''I'm kind of leaning toward Ron Paul,'' though he noted that the conservative talk radio hosts Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, where he gets a lot of his news, ''don't like Mr. Paul because of his ideas about the military.''
Mike Dulaney, a retiree, liked Mr. Paul's book ''End the Fed'' but questioned his stance on Iran. Mr. Paul had said that Iran's quest for a nuclear weapon, as documented in a recent international report, was overblown.
''I disagree,'' Mr. Dulaney said. ''I think Ahmadinejad is a very dangerous person who's going to try to prove something,'' he said, referring to Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He favored Mr. Romney, he said.
Lucy Reese, an independent, said she disagreed with many of Mr. Paul's positions, including his opposition to abortion rights. But she agreed with his focus on the currency system and on auditing the Federal Reserve.
''I am reluctant to commit to anybody, but if I had to pick, I'd pick Ron Paul,'' she said.

HEADLINE: As Myanmar Eases Controls, U.S. Sees Opening

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER and MARK LANDLER; Thomas Fuller reported from Bangkok, and Mark Landler from Washington.

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- The long-isolated nation of Myanmar embarked on a potentially decisive shift in direction on Friday, as its main opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, agreed to rejoin the country's political system and Hillary Rodham Clinton prepared to become the first secretary of state and highest-ranking American to visit the country in half a century.
The confluence of events, though weeks in the making, unfolded with dramatic speed during a tour of Southeast Asia by President Obama, and underscored the central message of the president's trip: that the United States intended to reassert itself in the Asia-Pacific region to limit the influence of a rising China.
Under decades of military rule, Myanmar, also known as Burma, counted neighboring China as its primary ally and economic partner. But a new cast of leaders there has begun to ease political controls, court the opposition and repair relations with Western and other Asian powers, an opportunity the Obama administration has eagerly embraced. 
Combined with the announcements this week that the United States would station 2,500 Marines in Australia and that it intended to enhance military ties with the Philippines, Mr. Obama's decision to send Mrs. Clinton to Myanmar next month clearly rattled Beijing, which has issued a series of warnings claiming that the United States is seeking to destabilize the political and military situation in the region.
''We are seeing a very significant new phase in U.S. policy toward China,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a top China adviser in the Clinton administration, ''a much more active, integrated, assertive U.S. posture in Asia than anyone expected six months ago.''
For Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the decision to reregister her party and compete in elections in the military-backed system represents a historic shift. Known globally as a symbol of endurance in the face of dictatorship, she has spent most of her 23 years in politics battling the country's generals, much of that time in prison or under house arrest. Now she is joining the system they created.
The civilian government that took power in March is dominated by former generals, including President Thein Sein. It has sought to liberalize Myanmar's moribund economy and pushed the country toward a more open political system, wooing Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi in a carefully choreographed rapprochement.
In announcing Mrs. Clinton's plans to visit, Mr. Obama cited ''flickers of progress'' in the country. The United States, he said, remains concerned about human rights abuses, the persecution of democratic reformers and brutality toward ethnic minorities.
But he hailed policies by Mr. Thein Sein as leading the country ''on the path toward reform.'' He cited the government's cooperation with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the release of political prisoners and the relaxation of media restrictions. ''These are the most important steps toward reform in Burma that we've seen in years,'' Mr. Obama said.
The subtext is that Myanmar has unexpectedly become a kind of diplomatic prize for the United States, which is eager to show its traditional allies in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand, that it is no longer distracted by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and that it is advancing democratic interests, promoting free-market economic reform and counterbalancing the power of authoritarian China.
While Mr. Obama traveled to Australia to seal an arrangement to base Marines there, Mrs. Clinton signed a declaration with the Philippines on the deck of an American destroyer that called for disputes over maritime claims in the South China Sea to be settled through a ''multilateral'' process -- something China has flatly rejected and a term the United States avoided when it first waded into the South China Sea dispute in July 2010.
She also somewhat provocatively referred to the South China Sea as the West Philippine Sea, a term preferred in the Philippines but reviled in Beijing.
Such moves, added together, may prompt broader alarm in China. ''With their mind-set, whatever you do, it may be considered part of a conspiracy,'' said Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Some China watchers say the American moves may feed suspicions in China that the United States is seeking to encircle it because it is uneasy with having an economic and military rival.
Indeed, China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, warned the United States on Friday to steer clear of territorial disputes between China and its neighbors, saying they ought to be resolved directly ''through friendly consultations.'' And the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed concern about the political changes in Myanmar, saying it hoped they would not destabilize the country.
In September, China aimed its anger at Myanmar after it suspended a Chinese-led project to build a hydroelectric dam in northern Myanmar, creating a rare rift between the countries.
This tension helps explain Myanmar's openness to dealing with the United States, which was itself eager to expand its presence in the region -- as Mrs. Clinton articulated in an article published this month in Foreign Policy magazine titled ''America's Pacific Century.''
''As the war in Iraq winds down and America begins to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan, the United States stands at a pivot point,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in the article. The United States should resist the temptation of downsizing its ''foreign engagement'' after the wars, she said, because engagement in Asia ''is critical to America's future.''
Administration officials say they are trying to bring China into the club of responsible great powers. Mrs. Clinton; Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser; and others have labored, with mixed results, to enlist China in problems like climate change, global economic imbalances and renegade nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea.
But progress is halting, officials admit. A senior administration official described China as a ''peculiar adolescent that can no longer hide behind its status as a developing nation, but does not see itself with the full responsibility of a global power.''
Closer ties to the United States would bring Myanmar full circle to its years immediately after independence from Britain in 1948. At the time Myanmar sought close ties with the West to balance relations with China, said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official.
In recent years, China has become one of Myanmar's largest trade partners, lured by bountiful natural resources. Myanmar has relied on China for much-needed investment, partly to mitigate the effects of Western sanctions.
Yet anti-Chinese sentiment has flared up periodically in Myanmar's history, and observers said resentment at China's plans to consume nearly all of the power from the halted dam was one reason the plan was so unpopular.
Aung Din, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Burma, a pressure group that supports Myanmar's democracy movement, says he saw the seeds of backlash against Chinese interests in Myanmar. ''Many projects are carried out by Chinese companies; prominent businessmen are Chinese; everything belongs to China, actually,'' he said. ''If we don't take any action, Burma will become a satellite state of China.''
Mrs. Clinton's visit, he said, might encourage the Burmese government and people ''to confront Chinese interests.''

HEADLINE: A Dude Ranch Rests Hopes on a Rockefeller Deal

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
MOOSE, Wyo. -- John D. Rockefeller Jr. fell in love with the West here, and left his fingerprints all over the place.
Beginning in the 1920s, a company disguised as a hunting club but fueled by Mr. Rockefeller's millions quietly bought tens of thousands of acres with the goal of conserving and preserving a staggeringly beautiful corner of western Wyoming, a process that culminated in 1950 with an act by Congress incorporating Grand Teton National Park.
Now a federal lawsuit, ostensibly over the concession contract for a historic dude ranch operating in the park, is resurrecting old questions about the Rockefeller legacy and the unique creation story of a place that historians say was very much shaped around one man's vision. 
The patchwork of deals, promises and betrayals that was formed in making Grand Teton -- hugely controversial a few generations ago, after the secret land acquisitions became public -- have resurfaced. Old ways of doing business in the West, with a handshake and a nod, have bumped against the modern mantra of competition, efficiency and markets.
At the center of the dispute is a family called the Turners, who have hosted legions of dudes -- a term, at least here, owing nothing to hipsters -- for five generations at a place called the Triangle X Ranch. The Turners began a guest and guide services operation on the wilderness site in 1926, during the golden age of dude ranching, before the advent of motels, car camping and Interstate highways. The Triangle X is the last dude ranch concession inside any United States national park, according to the Dude Ranchers' Association, a trade group.
In September, the National Park Service, citing a 1998 federal law requiring competition for business concessions in the parks, finally threw open the contract for running the Triangle X Ranch, which includes back-country camping, horseback riding and wrangling, to bidding. Until then, the family had been granted extensions of its previous contract.
The family, led by John F. Turner, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the administration of the elder President George Bush, fired back last month with a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Cheyenne. The suit accuses the Park Service of violating contractual promises first made by Mr. Rockefeller's land agents in 1929 when the family sold the Triangle X property to Mr. Rockefeller's Snake River Land Company -- promises that the suit says were made concrete and inviolate in the 1950 act of park incorporation.
''We had no choice but to stand up for a family legacy of 85 years,'' Mr. Turner said.
The suit says the family, under those old commitments, has a legal right to stay at the Triangle X until the last of the members who were living on the ranch in 1950 is dead. These family members include Mr. Turner, 69, and his brothers, Harold, 73, and Donald, 63.
Throwing open the business to competition might or might not be legal, a lawyer for the family said, but it is also irrelevant, he added, because the brothers have a right to stay no matter what. The family also owns the Triangle X name, as the Park Service acknowledges on its concession Web page, meaning that any new dude operator would presumably have to buy the name or start with something else.
''The existence of the concession law does not strip them of their special rights under the 1950 Grand Teton Act. That's a separate creature,'' said William P. Horn, a lawyer and a former assistant secretary of the interior who oversaw the Park Service in the Reagan administration and is representing the Turner family in the case.
The Park Service has until next month to reply to the lawsuit -- next month also being the deadline for concession applications. A spokeswoman said the bureau had no comment.
So what's left are history and economics: What parts of the old and odd Teton story might be relevant again? What pieces of value should be attached to tradition and what to the power of competition, in perhaps providing increased concession fees to park managers in tough budgetary times?
At the ranch, the dudes are gone for the season, the cabins cold and empty, the back country tents stored for the long winter. Rustic simplicity reigns.
''No chocolates on the pillow,'' John Turner said as he showed a reporter around the ranch on a snowy morning. ''No spas.''
It is a pitch, he said, that has kept generations of visitors coming back, seeking rough-hewn continuity in a changed and changing world. Electricity came to the ranch only in the 1950s.
One prominent historian who has written about the park, Robert W. Righter, said the Turners had anchored and sustained a piece of local culture from before the park's existence. But they have also sometimes acted, he said, as though they were entitled to be there and that the West was still the wild and woolly world their grandfather knew.
''The Turners have been there a long time, and they feel that sometimes the law and its particulars don't apply to them,'' said Mr. Righter, a research professor of history at Southern Methodist University and the author of a book on Grand Teton's creation. ''But I, for one, would hate to see them go and have some corporation come in.''
Whether Mr. Rockefeller, whose father corralled the early oil industry in a monopolistic trust in the early 1880s, would favor the Turner family's claim, or a capitalist free-for-all for the concession, is another question.
And the Turner family's feelings about the Rockefellers are just as complicated. Mr. Turner said his grandfather, John S. Turner, had never gotten over feeling deceived about the sale of the ranch to the Rockefeller front company once he learned of the hidden agenda.
Not unlike another real-estate drama of the early 20th century, in which Los Angeles acquired water rights in the Owens Valley on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada -- a scheme fictionalized in the movie ''Chinatown'' -- big money and powerful interests had hidden their aims.
''The code of the West was you trusted people, you believed people, but my grandfather was bitter, I think, his whole life that he'd been lied to,'' Mr. Turner said. But he said it was also hard to argue with results, both in the park's glory and in the Turner family story.
''Ironically, probably few people have benefited more from the establishment of the park than our family, because we've enjoyed being here 85 years,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Don't Give Up on Sanctions

BYLINE: By REUEL MARC GERECHT and MARK DUBOWITZ. 
Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former C.I.A. officer, is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where Mark Dubowitz is the executive director and head of its Iran Energy Project.

 BODY:
Washington
THE release last week of the International Atomic Energy Agency's report on Iran's progressing nuclear program has to make one wonder whether more than 30 years of sanctions have helped to thwart -- or even stall -- the country's nuclear designs. There is no evidence to suggest that economic coercion has ever made Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, rethink the risks-versus-rewards calculus for developing atomic weapons. And the truly crippling sanctions that might have more of an effect would never be accepted by Western politicians, who are fearful of higher oil costs and of being seen as too harsh on the Iranian people.
But giving up on sanctions is not the answer. Instead, we have to make sanctions smarter, more mutually reinforcing. 
The sale of oil -- about 2.3 million barrels are exported every day -- accounts for more than 50 percent of Iran's national budget. Under current American law, the importation of Iranian oil is prohibited, but gasoline refined from Iranian petroleum is not. Sanctions obviously need to hit this industry harder. But they must also avoid causing a significant increase in petroleum prices. If the United States were to impose an international embargo on Iranian crude, the price would skyrocket, providing Ayatollah Khamenei with a windfall profit. Tehran could simply sell less oil and make more money, while American consumers would suffer. When unrest in Libya took its 1.3 million barrels per day of crude off the market, Americans saw a spike in oil prices.
But effective energy sanctions don't have to raise oil prices; they can actually do the opposite. Washington just has to learn how to leverage greed.
We should bar from operating in the United States any European and most Asian energy companies that deal in Iranian oil and work with the Iranian central bank, Revolutionary Guards or National Oil Company. At the same time, however, we should allow companies from countries that have little interest in Iran's nuclear program, or its pro-democracy Green Movement, and that are willing to risk their access to American markets -- mainly Chinese companies -- to continue buying Iranian crude in whatever quantity they desire.
This would reduce the number of buyers of Iranian petroleum, without reducing the quantity of oil on the market. With fewer buyers to compete with, the Chinese companies would have significant negotiating leverage with which to extract discounts from Tehran. The government could lose out on tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue, loosening its hold on power.
This approach may seem distasteful to some, because it does, in a sense, reward bad Chinese behavior. But the objective of sanctions is to cause real economic pain in Tehran, not to make Americans feel moral. It would also, admittedly, be a hassle for many of our allies, but the short-term diplomatic trauma would not overwhelm Washington. And most important, markets would react in a rational way.
The Obama administration is obviously worried that more robust sanctions could shut down the export of oil and spook the markets. But support for such measures is rising in Congress. A powerful bipartisan coalition has developed in the House demanding an investigation of the Iranian central bank to ''expeditiously determine'' whether it's been involved in aiding terrorist activities or the development and proliferation of unconventional weapons. Severe sanctions against the bank would immediately follow.
But such sanctions need to be targeted correctly. If we selectively prohibited oil transactions among those companies we could influence, while not enforcing sanctions against Chinese energy firms, energy traders would quickly sense that only the number of purchasers had changed, while the quantity of oil on the market remained the same. And the Obama administration just might ride into the 2012 elections with the Islamic Republic in turmoil.
Iran hawks should not view sanctions as a pusillanimous cop-out. Like President Obama's failed attempt at diplomatic engagement, sanctions are an unavoidable and necessary prelude to any more forceful action to stop Ayatollah Khamenei's nuclear ambitions. America may be in for a long cold-war struggle in which sanctions will play a critical role in weakening Tehran. And the Islamic Republic hardly has the resources of the Soviet Union. This time, sanctions might actually, sooner rather than later, put our enemy on his knees.

HEADLINE: Insider Case May Consult President Of Goldman

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, is expected to be interviewed by the government in its insider-trading case against Rajat K. Gupta, a former director of the bank. 
Mr. Cohn's name emerged late Friday during a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan before Judge Jed S. Rakoff. Federal prosecutors and Mr. Gupta's lawyers debated the timing of depositions that are set to be taken in a parallel civil case being brought against Mr. Gupta by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The government has charged Mr. Gupta, who also served as a director of Procter & Gamble, with leaking secret board discussions to his friend Raj Rajaratnam, the former hedge fund manager who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month after his conviction on insider-trading charges. A trial is scheduled for April 2012.
Mr. Cohn's connection to the case emerged during Mr. Rajaratnam's trial. Prosecutors presented evidence showing that Mr. Rajaratnam had a two-hour lunch in July 2008 with Mr. Cohn and David Loeb, a Goldman salesman. Mr. Loeb was also named as a potential witness during Friday's hearing.
They also played a recording of a July 25, 2008 call between Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Gupta that mentioned Mr. Cohn. During the discussion, Mr. Rajaratnam told Mr. Gupta that he had a lunch scheduled with Mr. Cohn later in the week and asked Mr. Gupta about a rumor that Goldman might look to buy a commercial bank.
''This was a big discussion at a board meeting,'' Mr. Gupta said to Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Gupta went on to explain on the call that Goldman was mulling an acquisition of both Wachovia and American International Group.
Mr. Cohn is not the highest ranking Goldman official to play a role in the cases of Mr. Gupta and Mr. Rajaratnam. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the bank's chief executive, testified in March at Mr. Rajaratnam's trial about Mr. Gupta's role on the board and the secrets he had access to, including Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in the bank during the financial crisis.
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on Friday.
At the hearing, Judge Rakoff said that he would release a more complete list of potential witnesses on Monday.
It also emerged at Friday's hearing that Mr. Gupta's legal team includes Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton. Ms. White, a former United States attorney in Manhattan, is assisting Mr. Gupta's primarily counsel, Gary P. Naftalis and a team of lawyers at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, in Mr. Gupta's defense.
As per usual with Judge Rakoff's sessions, there were lighthearted moments. At one point, Mr. Naftalis mistakenly said that he was representing Mr. Rajaratnam instead of Mr. Gupta, but quickly corrected himself. Still, Judge Rakoff seized upon the gaffe.
''I wouldn't send your bill to Mr. Rajaratnam, at least not these days,'' the judge said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Part 6: Answers to Your Questions on Student Loans and Scholarships

BYLINE: MARK KANTROWITZ


HIGHLIGHT: Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid guru, is answering reader questions on student loans, scholarships and other financial topics of the season. 

 BODY:
To help readers of The Choice navigate the maze of scholarships available to them - as well as to further their understanding of President Obama's recent proposal to ease the repayment of some student loans - Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert and founder of the Web sites finaid.org and fastweb.com, is spending this week in our virtual Guidance Office. Mr. Kantrowitz is the author of "Secrets to Winning a Scholarship,'' published in February.
Mr. Kantrowitz's answers will continue through Sunday, but he is no longer accepting questions for this feature. Readers may still post comments using the box on the original post or start a new thread below. (Some questions may have been edited.)
--
Q.
How do you pay for college when you don't qualify for need-based aid, all in-state schools have rejected your student, and the only opening is an out-of-state public school with $30,000-plus/year in expenses? Are loans the only option? - 
A.
A student who has been rejected by in-state public four-year colleges should perhaps enroll in a local community college and plan on transferring to a four-year college after graduating with an associate's degree. In some states, including California, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, students who graduate from one of the state's community colleges are guaranteed admission to an in-state public four-year college.
It would also be a good idea for this student to meet with his high school guidance counselor. It is possible that the student applied to a too-aggressive mix of colleges and should consider reapplying to less selective colleges that are a better fit.
Also, some states have regional exchange programs that allow students who enroll at a public college in a neighboring state to qualify for in-state tuition.
Q.
I am currently a grad student who began an M.B.A. program in August 2009 that has been entirely financed by Federal Stafford and FFEL loans. I am able to finish next month, but in light of what I have read about the new income-based repayment guidelines I may pursue an additional concentration in spring 2012 in order to be sure I qualify for the 10 percent/20-year (10/20) plan. If I graduate in December 2011, am I eligible for the current 15 percent/25-year (15/25) guidelines? If I begin income-based repayment on 15/25, will I at any point be eligible to move to 10/20? My undergraduate loans are currently in deferment - in order to be eligible for 10/20, would I have to pay them off completely, or would I be permitted to leave them outside of the income-based repayment program for purposes of the 10/20 guidelines? - 
A.
To be eligible for the new 10 percent version of income-based repayment, you must have at least one federal student loan in 2012 or a subsequent year and no federal student loans from before 2008. Federal student loans include the Stafford and Grad PLUS loans, but not the Parent PLUS loan or private non-federal student loans.
Borrowers who have federal student loans from before 2008 and borrowers who do not have a federal student loan in 2012 or a subsequent year are eligible for the current 15 percent version of income-based repayment. This includes borrowers who graduated years ago. Even though the current version of income-based repayment became available on July 1, 2009, the repayment plan is available to all borrowers, even those who graduated before 2009.
Borrowers who start off with the 15 percent version of income-based repayment will not be able to switch to the 10 percent version of income-based repayment unless they borrow an additional federal student loan in 2012 or a later year. The most common scenario in which this might occur is for students who enter repayment in 2011, but return to college for an additional credential in 2012 or a later year.
Borrowers who have loans from before 2008 will have to pay off those loans in full in order to be considered a new borrower as of 2008. Otherwise they will be eligible only for the 15 percent version of income-based repayment.
The new income-based repayment plan is better than the current version of income-based repayment, since it cuts the monthly loan payment by a third from 15 percent of discretionary income to 10 percent. But the current version still offers distressed borrowers meaningful financial relief. If a borrower's debt exceeds their annual income, and there are no prospects for a significant increase in income, the borrower should consider switching to the income-based repayment plan.
The Department of Education has not yet published the rules concerning the new income-based repayment plan. It is possible that some details may change in the final rules. For example, there are rumors that the Department of Education may drop the requirement that borrowers not have loans from before 2008. It is unclear, however, whether they would be able to do this, since changes made by executive order must be cost-neutral to the federal government. The savings from facilitating the consolidation of split borrowers might not be enough to cover the cost of eliminating the requirement that the borrower be a new borrower as of 2008.
Q.
Our daughter is a sophomore at Barnard. She loves it and is doing incredibly well. We have borrowed to pay her tuition for the past two years, and were planning to borrow half next year and pay cash for the last year.
Unfortunately, my husband just lost his job. I'm still employed, but I don't bring home enough to cover our mortgage payment, much less the $52,000 a year for Barnard. If we are forced to default on our financial commitments, we won't be able to co-sign a loan for our daughter. And we could not in good conscience ask our elderly parents to take on this kind of debt, given their modest fixed incomes. Thanks to my job, we'll still be doing better than lots of people. We just won't have the cash for tuition. What do parents in our situation do? 
A.
This is not an uncommon situation in the current economy. Tell your college's financial aid administrator about the job loss. They are there to help. Ask the financial aid administrator for a professional judgment review. Provide the college with a copy of documentation of the job loss, such as a copy of the layoff notice or proof of the receipt of unemployment benefits within the last 90 days. The college financial aid administrator has the authority to base the family income on estimated income during the award year or the current calendar year instead of basing it on the prior tax year. Note that the college will count severance pay and unemployment benefits as part of the estimated income.
Q.
My husband and I own a small house that we purchased over 20 years ago. Ten years ago we purchased a small condo from which we run our small service business. I understand that a family's primary residence is exempt from consideration when applying for financial aid, but in planning for our daughter's pending college entry, we are finding that the small condo is being treated as a "second home" and is hurting our expected family contribution. We cannot find any way to explain that if we sold the condo, we would not have any place to run our business. Do you have any advice?
A.
If you incorporate the business and transfer ownership of the condo to the business, it will help clarify that the condo is used only for business purposes. If the business employs fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees and is owned and controlled by the family, the small business exclusion will cause the business's assets, including the condo, to be disregarded on the FAFSA.
Q.
If you are entering a sweepstakes or a lottery, by law the odds of winning must be listed. Why isn't there a similar law for scholarship contests? The scholarship providers know how many applicants they had in a particular year as well as how many scholarships were distributed. Having the historical information would help potential applicants know where their chances lie and help them to determine whether it's worth their time and effort to apply. 
A.
Sweepstakes, contests and lotteries are governed by a patchwork of federal and state laws. In particular, The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act (P.L. 106-168) regulates sweepstakes and contests, while state laws regulate lotteries.
A sweepstake is a game of chance which does not require a payment. A contest is a game of skill which requires a payment. A lottery is a game of chance that requires a payment.
None of these laws apply to scholarships, which select winners based on skill, not chance, and which do not require a payment.
Consumers would certainly find it helpful if scholarship programs disclosed the odds of winning as well as the number of scholarships and total dollar amounts awarded.
The Fastweb scholarship matching service automatically calculates the number of registered students who match each scholarship. If the scholarship matches more than a specific percentage of the registered students or the ratio of scholarship dollars to matching students falls below a particular threshold, the scholarship is classified as promotional and is indicated as such in the scholarship search results.
As a matter of policy, the Fastweb scholarship matching service generally does not include scholarships that charge an application fee.
Q.
To clarify: Anyone with Direct Loans which enter repayment BEFORE 2012 will not be eligible for the new 10 percent income-based repayment?- 
A.
Correct. If the borrower does not have at least one loan from 2012 or a later year, the borrower does not qualify for the 10 percent version of income-based repayment. So borrowers who have already entered repayment are eligible only for the 15 percent version of income-based repayment. However, if such a borrower goes back to school and gets a new loan in 2012 or a subsequent year, that borrower will then be eligible for the 10 percent version of income-based repayment.
Unfortunately, the president had to limit who could qualify for the new income-based repayment plan because he is implementing this change through an executive order. Executive orders must be cost neutral, since only Congress has the power to appropriate money. The president paired the improvements in income-based repayment with the incentives for consolidation of split borrowers because moving federally-guaranteed student loans into the Direct Loan program saves the government money. This money covers the cost of the incentives plus the cost of the improvements in income-based repayment. But it provides only enough savings to cover the cost of pushing up the new income-based repayment plan for borrowers who will be obtaining new loans in 2012 or a later year. Providing this benefit for all borrowers would cost too much.
Note that only the repayments made under the income-based repayment, income-contingent repayment or standard repayment plans (or any repayment plan with monthly payments that equal or exceed the monthly payments under standard repayment) count toward the 20- or 25-year forgiveness. So a borrower who has already made several years worth of payments under another repayment plan, such as graduated repayment or extended repayment, would have to reset the forgiveness clock to zero. Some borrowers who are far into one of these repayment plans may be better off sticking with their current repayment plan.

HEADLINE: Blooey

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Vicious eurospirals. 

 BODY:
Two weeks ago I wrote about the Blooey Factor:
I would consider the margin question part of a broader issue, which I think of as Shleifer-Vishny, after their classic paper on the limits of arbitrage (pdf). Their point was that a fall in the price of some asset, even if it should in principle present a buying opportunity if the fundamentals haven't changed, may actually be self-reinforcing instead if there is a limited class of leveraged investors who buy that asset. Why? Because the capital losses those investors suffer may force them to pull back instead of piling in.
I can see this happening here. Most Italian debt may be held by stolid domestic players, but at the margin are financial institutions that are quite possibly going to be forced to cut their holdings if Italian interest rates rise, because this will reduce the value of the bonds they already hold. So things could quite possibly go blooey in the very near future.
Today's Times:
Nervous investors around the globe are accelerating their exit from the debt of European governments and banks, increasing the risk of a credit squeeze that could set off a downward spiral. 
...
Experts say the cycle of anxiety, forced selling and surging borrowing costs is reminiscent of the months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when worries about subprime mortgages in the United States metastasized into a global market crisis.
Also:
The eurozone infection this week moved decisively from the periphery of the continent to its core.
Many investors are no longer just fretting about the possibility of a default here or there. They are now starting to worry about the chances of the euro itself breaking up. Bond markets may be putting as high a probability as 25 per cent on a split, according to Citi analysts.
And what is the new president of the ECB doing? Lecturing people on the need for discipline.
By the way, some commenters have been accusing me of crying wolf, because I've been warning about Eurogeddon for and the euro hasn't collapsed yet. Geez. Eurozone capital markets have basically frozen; nobody is buying debt either of many governments or of many banks. This doesn't bring the roof down overnight, but it will if this goes on for months.

HEADLINE: Christy Romer On Fiscal Policy

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: What we know and how we know it. 

 BODY:
A speech she gave two weeks ago (pdf). It's a very good summary of what we know and how we know it. A sample:
To illustrate why estimating the effects of fiscal policy is hard, let me start with an example. In February 2008, the Bush Administration and Congress came together to pass a tax cut-the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. This was before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but just after what we now date as the start of the recession in December 2007. The total budgetary cost of the bill was about $130 billion. Most of it came in the form of tax rebate checks mailed between April and July of 2008.
John Taylor, one of the economists saying loudly that fiscal stimulus doesn't work, has a short paper saying this tax rebate wasn't effective.1
Household income took a noticeable step up when the rebate checks came. Families had more money in their pockets. And yet, consumption did not rise at all. In fact, it fell a tiny bit. Clearly, Taylor says, the tax rebate had no effect. Almost his entire case is summed up by this figure. [FIGURE 1] It shows personal consumption expenditures and household disposable income (that is, income net of taxes).
The trouble with this analysis is, Professor Taylor wasn't thinking about what else was going on at the time. Democrats and Republicans didn't come together to pass the tax rebate for no reason. This was the heart of the subprime mortgage crisis. House prices were tumbling. Mortgage lenders like Countrywide Financial were in deep trouble. Economists were worried that consumption was about to plummet. For most families, their home is their main asset. When house prices fall, people are poorer, and so tend to cut back on their spending.
Against that background, the fact that consumption held steady around the time of the tax rebate may in fact be a sign of just how well it was working. It kept consumption up for a while, despite the strong downdraft of falling house prices.
She goes on to talk about more recent research.

HEADLINE: Voices of the Near Poor

BYLINE: SABRINA TAVERNISE, JASON DEPARLE and ROBERT GEBELOFF


HIGHLIGHT: A closer look at a new definition of poverty casts new light on the large number of Americans living just above the poverty line. Four residents of the Washington, D.C., area who fall into that group tell how they are coping. 

 BODY:
When the Census Bureau this month released a new measure of poverty, meant to better count disposable income, it began altering the portrait of national need.
The new method, called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, was designed to add in many of the things the old measure ignored, like the hundreds of billions the needy receive in food stamps and tax credits. At the same time, it subtracted the similarly large sums lost to taxes, medical care and work expenses.
One surprising difference with the new measure, outlined in an article today, was the 51 million people with incomes less than 50 percent above the poverty line. That category, sometimes called "near poor," was 76 percent higher than the official account, which was published in September. (The portion of people under the poverty line, meanwhile, increased by just 5 percent in the new measure.)
About a fifth of the people who appear near poor in the new measure are lifted out of poverty by benefits the old measure ignores, like food stamps and tax credits. But more than half were pulled down into near poverty from higher income levels by taxes, medical costs and work expenses like child care and gas. Taken together with people under the poverty line, a full third of Americans - or about 100 million people - live in poverty or in the economically vulnerable area just above it.
In Washington and its suburbs, the near poor are people with incomes between $31,693 and $47,539 for a family of four with a mortgage. Reporters talked to people in the Washington area this week with incomes in this category. They spoke of the knife-edge quality of their lives, in which one unexpected bill could knock them off balance. Many owned the usual trappings of middle-class life - cars, houses, cellphones and air-conditioners. But payments on those possessions were juggled, often unsuccessfully, depending on the unpredictable tides of their incomes. None saw themselves as poor. Most saw themselves as part of the middle class. But they focused on how hard they had to struggle to remain there.
Here are some of their stories:
Debra Jeje earned about $31,000 last year as a secretary in an emergency room in a hospital in Washington. She struggles to pay her bills, which come to about $2,300 a month, including groceries. She sells Mary Kay make-up for extra income. Gas, health insurance premiums and taxes put Ms. Jeje just above poverty line.
"What stresses me out most is payday," said Ms. Jeje, who is 50 and has one son living with her. "I don't have any extra money left over. My salary is less than my bills."
Her job, she said, pays too little.
"We're on the front lines," she said. "There's stress and headaches and ups and downs in the emergency room. You really feel that you're worth more."
Bille Allison, a health care worker with two children, earns $39,000 a year drawing blood at a doctor's office in Maryland. She qualified for the earned income tax credit last year, bringing her income to $42,000. But work expenses dragged her down. She pays $500 a month for day care for her 4-year-old daughter, $100 a month for bus and train fare to get to work, and $200 a month for health insurance - bringing her income down to about $32,000. Some months she is able to save enough for game tokens and a meal at Chuck E. Cheese for her daughter. Other months she can only afford to pay half her bills. She was turned away from the food stamps office because her income was too high.
"I tried everything, and it's like, nope, you make too much," said Ms. Allison, who is 42 and divorced. "They tell you you have to work to get help, but then you work, and you still can't get help."
Jennifer Bangura works at Georgetown University Hospital as a cashier. Together with her husband, a driver for a catering company, their family income is just under $50,000, enough to pay a mortgage of $800 on a house she purchased in 1992. But after taxes, medical costs and the gas to get to work, they slip into the category of near poor. Their situation has been made worse by a second mortgage, taken out several years ago to raise money for their daughter's college tuition. The monthly payment shot up to $2,200, an amount she says is now untenable.
"It's killing me," said Ms. Bangura, who is 50 and originally from Jamaica. She said she has been making payments for years and that "to lose it now would tear me apart."
Jessie Adams, a floor refinisher and his wife, a secretary, together earn about $49,000 - too much to qualify for the earned income tax credit and food stamps, but too little to live without worrying about finances. Taxes and monthly subway commuting costs bring them down into the area of near poor. They own electronics - two flat-screen TVs and an Xbox game console for their 10-year-old - but cannot afford a car or a down payment on a house. Mr. Adams has not taken his family out on a weekend for five months.
"It shouldn't be like this," he said. "Two people working full time in the house, we should be able to save, to take a vacation. But it ain't like that. It just ain't like that."

HEADLINE: My Coney Island Crime

BYLINE: JOSHUA COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: I came upon a man stealing sand from the beach, and then I helped him. 

 BODY:
Summers are tidal but beaches remain. I'd taken an apartment for the summer in Coney Island to write but found myself staying on after Labor Day - because I hadn't made any progress, my novel didn't have an ending, or a middle, or even a continuable beginning ("Summers are tidal but beaches remain") - and because I'd become something of an island myself. 
Coney Island, of course, isn't an island. It's called one; it used to be three. Coney, Pine and Gysbert Islands were joined by landfill throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, while the 1930s - perhaps the last decade Coney was relevant and fun, or fun enough - found the neighborhood definitively stripped of its insular status, when the final portions of creek that cut the amusements off from mainland Brooklyn were filled in to prepare for the construction of the Shore Parkway. For me, it was the reverse. The landfill that still connected me to the mainland of my life was my job. And then, in the second week of October, I lost my job. What I'm about to recount happened late at night on the first Friday of my unemployment. 
After writing my quota for the day (500 words), or after rewriting what that quota had to be (250's O.K.), and having no money left to spend on whatever people spend money on (movies? bars? apartments in vitrine buildings with dedicated bicycle storage, where each unit comes complete with a spare office set aside for each couple's eventual parturition?), I'd taken to walking at night. Stalking the boardwalk past the lamplight diffusion. Some nights there was a moon; other nights there was no moon; always there was the Lower New York Bay, called by a geographically oblivious girl I once interrupted taking fog photographs of the ruinous Wonder Wheel - "The Ocean." On nights with no moon it was so dark out there the weather and wake seemed one. The dark thwack of sneakers on planks. The soft boards whose knots are black gum. 
That night there was a scud of red up ahead, where the boardwalk swerves like a D.U.I. at Ocean Parkway. I went toward that blink, blinking, heard a rumble, a wheeze - it was a truck, backed up to the beach. 
A slow, short old man stood with a shovel on the sand three steps down. His nose was inverted, in a sense; it resembled a thumbprint like a cop would take but not in ink, in concrete. He had thick purplish bursts of scar tissue behind his ears, and was shaking. He dug down and then, weak with the weight of each load, shoveled the sand into large bags and then flung the bags into the back of his truck, but because of the wind some of the sand he loaded, or much, was blown back into his face, open-mouthed. 
I'm describing him in this detail so as to delay mentioning my complicity in his crime. That what I did was illegal I ascertained the following morning with a clipped call to 311, the city's information hotline. 
Dialect in writing is frowned upon now as irresponsible, even unethical, as it tends to separate the speaker from the unspoken normative - racially or socioeconomically isolating the speaker's essential strangeness in a process not unlike, I thought, what this man was doing now: taking sand and shoving it sackward to make, presumably, of the open public beach an artificial, private enterprise. 
This man was, like most of my neighbors, Russian or Russianish. I can't possibly communicate his accent or the incoherent care with which he navigated phrases - I can't with any accuracy and won't. I know I began by asking what he was doing and he in all disfluency made it known that he was digging for sand. "For what?" I think I asked. "Why?" The man was unable to make himself understood. Were the sandbags for incipient flooding? Or for a sandbox for his children or grandchildren? Or was this sand for a golf course he'd contracted with, mini or major, northern New Jersey's foremost fraudulent links - the sport of the suburbs hazarded, trapped, by the sand of a citybound beach?
The man appeared wrecked. By his exertion? By my presence? I thought - but only the next morning when I'd hung up on the harassed 311 operator, who in my imagination was forwarding my number to the police - that this digging could characterize immigration, or emigration, too: you take what you can from your home country, toss it into bags and get ready to flee, hoping it's enough, hoping the grains will last you. And so, I can't explain why, I volunteered. I said - here I'll quote myself because I'm sure of what I said - I said, "Let me." 
This he understood, the gesture at least. He handed me the shovel, let me turn it to verb. He took a cigarette from a pocket and smoked it and stubbed it out and then drank what could have been coffee - what could have been anything - and then took the cigarette stub and floated it in the cup atop its liquid as if not wanting to leave any trace behind besides the deep grave in the sand, the marks of rear tires. I shoveled, perspired, felt myself stretching after weeks inside with the windows half-wide, reading the pages, writing the margin. Exerting myself, I broke with the cold. I filled one bag, two bags, before moving on down the boardwalk toward Sea Gate. On my walk back home the truck was gone, to a purpose that remains untranslated.

HEADLINE: No Turkeys Here

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's easy to find signs of hope in the people and organizations who've been prodding American food back on a natural, sustainable, beautiful track. 

 BODY:
There are days when it seems - both in and out of the food world - that Everything Is Going Wrong. That makes it easy enough to complain, and I'm not alone in doing so routinely. Nothing tastes the way it used to. Even pricey restaurants have lost their glow. Quality is shot. People die from eating melons. The dominance of hyper-processed, industrialized food (and, more to the point, food-like products) is spreading globally, and we're all gaining weight faster than ever, while wrecking the planet.
Nevertheless, it's nearly as easy to find signs of hope - lots of them - as well as people and organizations who've been prodding American food back on a natural, sustainable, beautiful track.
Then, of course, there are the things that just plain make you glad to be alive. Aside from the smell of garlic simmering in olive oil, what and whom am I thankful for? In no particular order:
1. Start - as many of those involved in the food movement did - with Marion Nestle, the nutrition and policy guru and an all-around heroine. (Her daily blog, Food Politics, is always worth a look.) Put simply: eat per Marion's advice and you'll be eating better. (You'll probably live longer, too, but as Marion might say, "the studies are incomplete.")
2. For low-income people, better eating often starts with WIC and SNAP. It's a shame we need these food assistance programs, but it's great that we have them, and we must fight to preserve and improve them.
3. There are more than half as many farmers' markets as there are McDonald's. The markets are gaining ground, and fantastic groups like Wholesome Wave are making them more affordable.
4. You gotta love food markets like Oakland's People's Grocery and the Park Slope Food Co-op, for their daily demonstration that corporate supermarkets aren't the only way to shop.
5. Hooray for the Environmental Working Group, our best watchdog on misallocated subsidies, ethanol policies and a variety of conservation issues.
6. Let's thank Europe. I agree, Europe is wholly un-American. But food-wise, we have more to learn from them than the other way around. Examples of how to move forward on food policy and agriculture while clinging (if by a carrot paring) to worthwhile traditional ways abound.
7. While we're over there, let's thank H.R.H. Prince Charles, who's smart and outspoken enough to make you reconsider the notion of royalty. A couple of other admirable non-Americans are the United Nations' Olivier De Schutter, a key figure in recognizing and promoting agro-ecological agriculture, and Vandana Shiva, who fights for food as nourishment, not commodity.
8. Back home: Will Allen and the Milwaukee-based Growing Power, Malik Yakini and the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, and Nevin Cohen of the Five Borough Farm are, along with the other pioneers of the urban food movement, making a difference.
9. Journalists. Especially Barry Estabrook (of the blog Politics of the Plate), Tom Philpott (Mother Jones) and Tom Laskawy (Grist), old-school guys who dig up the food stories you need to read. In her blog and her book (both called "Superbug"), Maryn McKenna routinely scares me half to death. Then there's Raj Patel, a social justice writer who focuses on food; his "Stuffed and Starved" is a classic critique of the world food "system." (Raj is also, by some accounts, the Messiah. But I know him and he's not great.)
10. Can't mention Estabrook (or his book "Tomatoland") without a shout out to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, who showed that farmworkers could fight for and win better working conditions.
11. Speaking of fighting, Just Label It and others are involved in the much-needed struggle for better food labeling.
12. If Michael Pollan had done nothing other than say, "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants," we'd still owe him a great debt. But his new edition of rules ("An Eater's Manual") features the typically gorgeous art of the great Maira Kalman.
13. We also owe the Humane Society of the United States, Mercy for Animals and PETA (they can be extreme and, I think, even silly, but still...). All decry animal abuse on a daily basis, sometimes at physical risk to their employees. It's tough work; it isn't pretty; but as awareness increases so will the cry for change.
14. For his long-range view and persistence, you have to love Wes Jackson, whose Land Institute is advancing perennial agriculture as an alternative to input-heavy annual monoculture.
15. Few views are as long-range as those of Wendell Berry, who's pushing 80. The farmer, poet, novelist and essayist is a leading voice for sustainability and common sense, and perhaps the first scribe of the food movement.
16. Serious thanks to Bill McKibben, who's trying to keep the earth in good enough shape to grow things on it, and Tim DeChristopher, who put his freedom on the line (and lost it) protesting oil and gas leases on public land.
17. And to Bill Marler, who, as the leading food safety attorney in the country, is trying to keep the things we grow from killing us. Check out Michele Simon on Marler's Food Safety News, too.
18. The Rudd Center has spearheaded the movement for a much-needed soda tax. When that happens ... well, woo-hoo: we'll know that serious and lasting change has come.
19. For better and still improving school lunches, let's thank Ann Cooper (the Renegade Lunch Lady), Kate Adamick, the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act and (why not? it's Thanksgiving) Michelle Obama. (At this point, a nod to the world's most famous walking advertisement for a plant-based diet: Bill "Mr. Slim" Clinton.)
20. With Washington on the agenda, a shout out to Ezra Klein, the hardworking economics and politics writer whose daily WonkBlog is indispensable. (The food link: I met Ezra when he criticized my mah-po tofu. No one's perfect.)
21. Four D.C. lawmakers with the guts to fight Big Ag: Senators Bernie Sanders (a national treasure), Jon Tester, an organic farmer, and Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Chellie Pingree. There are others, but not enough; next year there should be more.
22. Let's acknowledge all real farmers, stewards of the earth, as well as those fishers and ranchers who get it: there are plenty, and their numbers are increasing.
23. Much movement in the right direction is thanks to groups like Food and Water Watch and American Farmland Trust ("No Farms, No Food").
24. But you don't need to be a farmer to grow food: check out Roger Doiron and his plan for "subversive plots" that will not only lead to greater individual self-sufficiency but will also point to a better way of growing and eating.
25. Finally: Thanks to anyone who's started a small farm in the last five years, and anyone who's supported one; anyone who cooks, and especially anyone who teaches others to cook. In these realms, let's thank FoodCorps, SlowFood USA and Cooking Matters, all doing great work. As are millions of individuals. Bless you.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Pessimism

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Just 72 hours before a deadline to present Congress with a plan to cut $1.2 trillion from the nation's deficit, pessimism mounted among members of a joint Congressional committee about their ability to strike a deal by Monday and avert a high-profile failure, Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear report.

        
Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, has been an important ally to the financial industry, and Elizabeth Warren, a consumer advocate and his opponent in the 2012 campaign, has described herself as an intellectual godmother of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Mr. Brown's support for the industry - and Ms. Warren's battles with it - are becoming a defining issue in one of the most hotly contested Senate races and a magnet for special interest money, Nicholas Confessore reports.

        
Representative Ron Paul's core followers have usually added up to less than 10 percent in opinion surveys, but now, thanks to the best organized grassroots campaign in Iowa and heavy spending on advertising, Mr. Paul is breaking through that ceiling and giving rise to a once far-fetched scenario -- that he might win the state's caucus on Jan. 3, Trip Gabriel reports.
Weekly Address

        
Over the last decade, America began relying too heavily on what it bought and consumed, increasing the debt load but not the number of jobs, President Obama said. He delivered the weekly address during his trip to the Asia Pacific, where he announced a series of agreements that are aimed at rebuilding the America economy. "Here in Indonesia, I was proud to join leaders from some of our nation's top companies as they announced trade deals that will support nearly 130,000 American jobs and potentially increase U.S. exports by up to $39 billion," he said. "These agreements will help us reach my goal of doubling American exports by 2014 - a goal we're now on pace to meet." To ensure that the American economy will be lasting and competitive, the country's manufacturing strength will have to be restored and the resulting goods need to be available to a wider network of customers. "After all, 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside our borders," he said. "And as the fastest-growing region in the world, no market is more important to our economic future than the Asia Pacific - a region where our exports already support five million American jobs."
Around the Web

        
Congressional Republicans say that Justice Elena Kagan's role in the Obama administration during health care reform may be grounds for her to recuse herself from the coming case, Politico reports.
Happenings in Washington

        
There will be a card-making event at the American Red Cross headquarters for people to send holiday cheer to United States service members and their families. The Red Cross is located downtown at 1730 E. Street, N.W.

        
A prayer rally is expected to gather at 3 p.m. in Lafayette Park across from the north side of the White House to pray and encourage members of the special bipartisan Congressional panel on deficit reduction to preserve funding for programs that assist the most at-risk families in the United States.

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Seven members of the deficit reduction committee join the Sunday shows. Can the panel meet its Wednesday deadline and avert deep cuts? 

 BODY:
The countdown has begun. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction has until Monday to submit a plan for review by the Congressional Budget Office before presenting that proposal to Congress on Wednesday. But with Democrats rejecting the Republicans' latest proposal, it is unclear whether the committee can overcome the impasse and avoid deep cuts to federal services and defense spending.
Several committee members will venture out to the Sunday shows to signal whether a deal can be struck before the clock runs out, with the leaders of the panel, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, appearing on "Fox News Sunday" and CNN's "State of the Union," respectively.
Joining Mr. Hensarling on Fox will be Representative Xavier Becerra, a California Democrat who is on the committee, and Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. One question is the United States can expect its credit rating to be downgraded again if the committee fails.
In addition to Ms. Murray, CNN features Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. Mr. Paul asserts that President Obama would like the committee to fail because it would help him get re-elected.
Also on CNN: former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice talks about Syria, Afghanistan and the views of the Republican presidential candidates on foreign policy. Then, Rich Galen, a former aide to Newt Gingrich, and Robert S. Walker, a former Pennsylvania representative and House colleague of Mr. Gingrich, weigh in on his recent rise in the polls.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona and Senate minority whip, will appear on NBC's "Meet the Press" to talk about the deficit reduction panel, of which they are also members.
CBS's "Face the Nation" features Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania and another member of the committee. Also on the show will be Representative Ron Paul of Texas and Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia.
Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina and also a member of the committee, will join Bloomberg's "Political Capital" along with Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the Republican Study Committee.
On C-Span's "Newsmakers," Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, shares his views as a former member of the bipartisan "Gang of Six" about whether this particular bipartisan committee can succeed where others have failed and propose an appealing deficit reduction plan to Congress by its deadline.
Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, also weighs in on the committee and the Republican presidential field on TV One's "Washington Watch."
The 2012 presidential race is on the agenda on ABC's "This Week," which will host Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago. The former White House chief of staff makes the case for re-electing Mr. Obama and talks about how the government can stimulate job growth.
Herman Cain addresses his economic plan, allegations of sexual harassment and immigration policy on Univision's "Al Punto."
And "Enfoque," a Spanish-language public affairs program on Telemundo, has Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who discusses jobs and immigration.
Hungry for more? You might be forgiven for having trouble keeping up with all of the deficit reduction proposals that have been thrown around this year. Check out this graphic to learn about the plan that will be put in place should the committee fail, and some of the ideas that preceded it.

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: In this edition: a sharp-elbowed debate about the efficacy of forecasting presidential elections. 

 BODY:
Reactions
In The Times's Sunday Magazine a couple of weeks ago, Nate analyzed four possible ways the 2012 general election might play out. The article, "Is Obama Toast? Handicapping the 2012 Election," and the model it was based on, which used three inputs - the president's approval rating a year before the election, gross domestic product and the ideology of the Republican nominee - elicited a lot of responses from around the Web and was quickly swept up in a flurry of sharp-elbowed articles about the efficacy of forecasting presidential elections.
In the discussion of forecasting generally, Sean Trende at RealClearPolitics took a skeptical view of the practice. And The Daily Beast's Michael Tomasky predicted "economic-determinist political scientists" will be "going back to the drawing board in 2013."
Seth Masket, at the blog Enik Rising, pushed back at Mr. Trende's article. Harry Enten, at Margin of Error, offered an opinion. Brendan Nyhan, an assistant professor in the department of government at Dartmouth College, accused many of the forecasting takedowns of relying on straw men. And John Sides - who has strolled down the FiveThirtyEight red carpet - wrote a very smart take on the whole discussion.

Regarding "Is Obama Toast?" specifically, Nate already responded to a critique by Bloomberg's Ron Klain. But Mr. Klain has written a thoughtful response to Nate's response. (For all the back and forth, Nate and Mr. Klain seem to agree on much.)
New York magazine's Jonathan Chait thought Nate's article was too pessimistic about President Obama's re-election chances. Mr. Chait posited that a president's approval rating is relative, so that once a Republican opponent is selected and steps onto the national stage, Mr. Obama's numbers may get bumped up by the comparison. "In other words, incumbent approval rating isn't something that's independent of the opposing candidate," Mr. Chait wrote.
At Hot Air, Karl was not happy with Nate's model. Neither were Mr. Nyhan and Jacob Montgomery. Writing at Mr. Nyhan's blog, their main criticism was with the inclusion of the opposing candidate's ideology as a factor in determining the incumbent's re-election chances.
Perhaps the most imaginative interpretation of Nate's magazine article came from Jim Messina, President Obama's 2012 campaign manager. USA Today's Aamer Madhani reported that, in an e-mail to supporters, Mr. Messina wrote that the article "uses a mathematical formula to conclude who will win this race. In other words, it says neither you nor Barack Obama has a role to play in this election, because the outcome is essentially predetermined." Of course, that is not what Nate's article said.
In the past few weeks, President Obama was not the only 2012 candidate to be juxtaposed with toast. After Rick Perry's"oops" moment, FiveThirtyEight asked "Is Perry Toast?" Brad Knickerbocker, at The Christian Science Monitor, wrote an interesting and in-depth analysis of the moment and what it might mean for the Perry campaign.
And some lively debate centered around a 2012 contender who already is toast: Tim Pawlenty. FiveThirtyEight disputed the notion that Tim Pawlenty would have been the likely beneficiary of the "Surge Theory" (his poll numbers would have quickly shot up) had he not dropped out of the Republican nominating contest in mid August. At The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner - who wrote one of the original articles that FiveThirtyEight responded to - was not persuaded by FiveThirtyEight's arguments. Mr. Pawlenty "wouldn't need a magical surge; he would instead just need the time for voters to focus on him again," Mr. Chotiner wrote.

Jon Bruner, at Forbes' Data Driven blog, used Internal Revenue Service returns to track the migration of Americans over the last several years with a cool interactive graphic.
YouGov BrandIndex, a consumer research firm, found that Herman Cain's run for the Republican presidential nomination may be leading to partisanship in perceptions of Godfather's Pizza.
iWatch News and the Center for Responsive Politics looked at the campaign donations being amassed by freshman members of Congress's Tea Party Caucus.
And USA Today utilized Pew data to map religious beliefs in the United States state-by-state.

HEADLINE: Gap Between Rich and Poor In Area Is Widest in Berkeley

BYLINE: By AARON GLANTZ. 
aglantz@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Berkeley, the leftist city whose University of California campus erupted in protest this week as part of the Occupy Wall Street movement, has the widest gap between rich and poor in the Bay Area, according to recently released data from the Census Bureau. 
The city that features famous restaurants like Chez Panisse and hilltop mansions with breathtaking views of San Francisco Bay is also one where 10 percent of households subsist on less than $10,000 a year.
City leaders, who have wrestled with inequality for years, said they were not surprised by the new economic data, which also show that the median income for households headed by non-Hispanic whites is $77,000, compared with $26,000 for those headed by African-Americans.
''We talk about the war in Afghanistan and support Bradley Manning,'' Councilman Jesse Arreguin said, referring to the American soldier in the WikiLeaks case, ''but we don't do enough for the people in our own community.''
Burlingame, Menlo Park, Oakland, Palo Alto and San Francisco also ranked high on the Census Bureau's Gini Index, which measures, on a scale from 0 to 1, the extent to which an area's wealth is concentrated within a small percentage of the population. A jurisdiction where one household controls all the wealth would be given a score of 1 on the index -- named for Corrado Gini, an Italian statistician -- while an area where income distribution is perfectly even would be scored at zero.
Berkeley's score, 0.516, put it at the top of the Bay Area list, but it was still lower than Manhattan's (0.600) and that of Los Angeles (0.525). The national average is 0.469.
Bay Area cities with low Gini scores were primarily middle-income suburbs, including Daly City, Dublin, San Lorenzo and Windsor.
Alan Berube, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Berkeley's high score was in part a reflection of the fact that the city's wealthier residents were willing to finance generous social programs and approve zoning ordinances that allowed for affordable apartments and residential hotels.
Mr. Berube's research has shown that the area of central Berkeley bounded by University Avenue and Oxford Street has one of the highest concentrations of poverty in the Bay Area, on par with perennially distressed areas like West Oakland and the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco.
''You won't see an income inequality like that in Orinda, because there is simply nowhere there for poor people to live,'' Mr. Berube said.
Other observers said income inequality persisted in Berkeley because the city's most progressive policies had been blocked by higher authorities. In 2009, for example, the California Supreme Court let stand a ruling voiding ordinances that require developers to set aside units for low-income residents when they build new apartment complexes.
But Councilman Kriss Worthington said officials were not giving up in efforts to reduce inequality. ''We're dealing with deep-rooted social problems,'' he said. ''We need to have an open mind and try new things.''

HEADLINE: Throwing Caution to the Wind Despite a Chilly Economy

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
BARRICADED against the financial storms, Americans aren't exactly whistling ''Here Comes the Sun.''
Convertible sales have slumped as the economy has suffered, especially for those two-seat summertime playthings that suggest the livin' is easy. Roll down your depressed block in a new red convertible and a neighbor may smack you. Your brother-in-law may ask for a loan.
After holding steady at roughly 2 percent of the market through 2008, convertible purchases have fallen ever since, to just 1.3 percent in 2010 and 2011, according to J. D. Power & Associates.
Yet automakers keep their most carefree models coming, banking on a time when superegos soar and buyers re-turn, eager to reaffirm the American dream of blowing too much money on a new car. 
''Carefree'' certainly describes the Mercedes SLK, which for the two preceding generations has been as frivolous as they come -- what Paris Hilton might have driven if she hadn't been able to afford her $450,000 Mercedes McLaren SLR.
From the SLK's beginnings, Mercedes paid lip service to sports-car values. Still, the original model in particular came off as a distracted debutante, more interested in catchy accessories than in catching Porsches.
Arriving here in 1997, the Mercedes did inspire a wave of convertible copycats with its motorized retractable hardtop. These well-insulated roofs add weight and steal cargo space, but make a convertible easy to live with year-round in the country's cooler regions.
For the second-generation model, the useful weather gimmick was the Airscarf, with a heater fan in the headrests that would toast your nape and noggin on chilly days.
The new SLK further lowers the bar for technical significance with its optional Magic Sky Control, which turns a huge roof panel from transparent to a dark-blue tint at the touch of a button. But the feature seems overpriced at $2,500, especially when a $50 sliding shutter would achieve much the same result. (Buyers can also choose a standard body-color steel roof or, for $500, a panoramic roof with a permanent tint.)
The Magic Sky trick holds your interest for about five minutes. Fortunately, the car beneath it has finally grown up to command respect on its own terms.
Aside from a somewhat disappointing transmission, this SLK looks and feels like a real Mercedes roadster, not a waffling compromise between performance and luxury. Finally, you won't mind parking this junior partner alongside its mentor, the roughly $100,000 SL-Class that has been a symbol of Mercedes aspiration since the 1950s.
The SLK's biggest problem, I'm convinced, was that it was never comfortable in the SL's shadow, always trying to match that car's well-bred grand-touring manners, rather than finding its own friskier path.
But recently, Mercedes's newfound commitment to high performance has produced a grittier sports car: the 563-horsepower SLS AMG, whose gullwing doors trace a direct line to the revolutionary 300SL of the mid-1950s.
And while I'd never suggest that the little SLK can assault the tarmac like the exotic $185,000 SLS, I do detect a trace of that supercar's heady spirit, a sharp metallic tang on top of the usual strawberries and cream.
The SLK's appealing new body received bouquets from sidewalk critics in New York and Boston. The design nods directly to the SLS with its blunt, extruded nose and supersize tristar shot through with a single chrome fin. The stretched hood and pert bubble of a greenhouse are familiar SLK cues, but the car looks richer and more masculine, with SL-style haunches and a pair of aluminum-trimmed roll hoops rising like pyramids from the rear deck.
The origami roof, so groundbreaking 15 years ago, now folds in 20 seconds, shaving two seconds off last year's time and five from the original version's. Also new is the Airguide wind deflector, a $350 pair of clear plexiglas triangles that pivot from the roll bars.
With the top raised, there's a class-leading 10.1 cubic feet of trunk space, about 20 percent more than the BMW Z4's. Folding the top reduces the space to 6.4 cubic feet, slightly more than a Mazda Miata's. You will still have to pack efficiently.
The upgraded interior also adopts SLS cues and philosophy: conservative, genuine luxury that eschews overheated gimmicks. A racy flat-bottom steering wheel and lustrous wood rim could be misconstrued; is this supposed to be a Ferrari or a Lexus? But here, the mixed message works.
A second SLK that I tested featured a $2,500 Sport package that included a more sculptured body, a metal-trimmed steering wheel, 18-inch AMG alloy wheels and ''solar red'' cabin lighting.
Air flows through four jet-turbine-style metal vents; the console is smartly trimmed in either wood or aluminum. The excellent sport seats incorporate magnesium frames for strength and lightness. Those seats are wrapped in sun-reflective leather -- an innovation first offered by BMW -- that significantly reduces surface temperatures in sunlight, helping to avoid roasted thighs on blazing afternoons. The SLK is far from cheap, starting at $55,685, yet the deluxe cabin helps to justify the price.
The SLK also adopts the latest Comand control interface with a seven-inch screen. New in the SLK, the Attention Assist system monitors driving patterns and suggests a rest stop if the pilot shows signs of sleepiness, like small steering corrections.
Compared with last year's V-6 model that had the same 3.5-liter displacement, an increase of 2 horsepower (to 302) might seem a holding pattern. But press the gas pedal and the new engine's benefits -- including direct injection and an especially high 12.2:1 compression ratio -- are heard and felt.
The new V-6 sets its cylinder banks at a narrower 60-degree angle (versus 90 degrees previously), eliminating the need for a balance shaft to quell vibration. Fuel economy has jumped to 20 m.p.g. in town, 29 on the highway, up from 19/25.
(This March, the V-6 model will be bookended with two new versions: a starter-model SLK250 with a 201-horsepower turbo 4-cylinder, and for power users, a limited-edition 415-horsepower SLK55 AMG with a 5.5-liter V-8. The brutish AMG model will be civilized somewhat by a fuel-saving stop/start system and cylinder deactivation).
Yet the V-6 version is plenty fast for most convertible cruisers. An urgent, galloping rasp accompanies a 5.4-second sprint from 0 to 60 m.p.h., as tested by Car and Driver, and a computer-limited top speed of 155 m.p.h.
And after decades of being comfortably numb, Mercedes has lately discovered something called steering feel: this roadster hugs curves and humps over rough pavement with serene body control, which is nothing new to anyone who's driven the company's pricier models.
What is new is the SLK's sense that the driver should feel the good stuff happening below. That feedback never reaches the level of a Porsche Boxster -- there's still a sense of luxurious Mercedes isolation -- but this SLK has a surprising appetite for spaghetti-strand curves.
Too bad the fun doesn't extend to the transmission. The 7G-Tronic automatic works acceptably up to a modestly sporty pace. It offers the latest functions: skipping past several gears -- say, from sixth to third -- when you floor the accelerator, or detecting grades to avoid busy shifting on hills. But the transmission is a ditherer when you need to drive assertively. Shifts can be syrupy or abrupt, even in the Sport setting. In the manual paddle-shift mode, the gearbox often downshifts unpredictably, unbidden by the driver's hand.
On challenging roads in upstate New York, the transmission, along with a too-jumpy throttle, tended to trip up the SLK's balance; the Mercedes automatic poses no challenge to the lightning-quick dual-clutch automated manuals from Porsche, Audi and BMW. It's the one area where Mercedes seems to have lost its nerve, tuning the SLK's gearbox for everyday comfort rather than serious performance. And it's especially perplexing because, of late, Mercedes transmissions have been uniformly satisfying.
The other disappointment is that unlike the Z4, Boxster, Audi TT or Chevrolet Corvette, there is no manual-transmission alternative. Enthusiasts will have that choice again in the spring, but only with the 4-cylinder, an engine that seemed uninspired when I sampled it in the new C250 sedan.
Garnished with pricey options, the SLKs I tested reached $65,245 and $67,125, roughly in line with the Boxster S, the Z4 sDrive 35i and the more powerful Corvette convertible and Audi TT RS.
In the current bearish market, buying Mercedes's two-seat hair-tousler might help to lift consumer confidence, at least on your own block. Just don't show it to your brother-in-law.
INSIDE TRACK: Mercedes's distracted rich kid grows up and joins the family business.

HEADLINE: How About Better Parents?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
IN recent years, we've been treated to reams of op-ed articles about how we need better teachers in our public schools and, if only the teachers' unions would go away, our kids would score like Singapore's on the big international tests. There's no question that a great teacher can make a huge difference in a student's achievement, and we need to recruit, train and reward more such teachers. But here's what some new studies are also showing: We need better parents. Parents more focused on their children's education can also make a huge difference in a student's achievement.
How do we know? Every three years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or O.E.C.D., conducts exams as part of the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, which tests 15-year-olds in the world's leading industrialized nations on their reading comprehension and ability to use what they've learned in math and science to solve real problems -- the most important skills for succeeding in college and life. America's 15-year-olds have not been distinguishing themselves in the PISA exams compared with students in Singapore, Finland and Shanghai. 
To better understand why some students thrive taking the PISA tests and others do not, Andreas Schleicher, who oversees the exams for the O.E.C.D., was encouraged by the O.E.C.D. countries to look beyond the classrooms. So starting with four countries in 2006, and then adding 14 more in 2009, the PISA team went to the parents of 5,000 students and interviewed them ''about how they raised their kids and then compared that with the test results'' for each of those years, Schleicher explained to me. Two weeks ago, the PISA team published the three main findings of its study:
''Fifteen-year-old students whose parents often read books with them during their first year of primary school show markedly higher scores in PISA 2009 than students whose parents read with them infrequently or not at all. The performance advantage among students whose parents read to them in their early school years is evident regardless of the family's socioeconomic background. Parents' engagement with their 15-year-olds is strongly associated with better performance in PISA.''
Schleicher explained to me that ''just asking your child how was their school day and showing genuine interest in the learning that they are doing can have the same impact as hours of private tutoring. It is something every parent can do, no matter what their education level or social background.''
For instance, the PISA study revealed that ''students whose parents reported that they had read a book with their child 'every day or almost every day' or 'once or twice a week' during the first year of primary school have markedly higher scores in PISA 2009 than students whose parents reported that they had read a book with their child 'never or almost never' or only 'once or twice a month.' On average, the score difference is 25 points, the equivalent of well over half a school year.''
Yes, students from more well-to-do households are more likely to have more involved parents. ''However,'' the PISA team found, ''even when comparing students of similar socioeconomic backgrounds, those students whose parents regularly read books to them when they were in the first year of primary school score 14 points higher, on average, than students whose parents did not.''
The kind of parental involvement matters, as well. ''For example,'' the PISA study noted, ''on average, the score point difference in reading that is associated with parental involvement is largest when parents read a book with their child, when they talk about things they have done during the day, and when they tell stories to their children.'' The score point difference is smallest when parental involvement takes the form of simply playing with their children.
These PISA findings were echoed in a recent study by the National School Boards Association's Center for Public Education, and written up by the center's director, Patte Barth, in the latest issue of The American School Board Journal.
The study, called ''Back to School: How parent involvement affects student achievement,'' found something ''somewhat surprising,'' wrote Barth: ''Parent involvement can take many forms, but only a few of them relate to higher student performance. Of those that work, parental actions that support children's learning at home are most likely to have an impact on academic achievement at school.
''Monitoring homework; making sure children get to school; rewarding their efforts and talking up the idea of going to college. These parent actions are linked to better attendance, grades, test scores, and preparation for college,'' Barth wrote. ''The study found that getting parents involved with their children's learning at home is a more powerful driver of achievement than parents attending P.T.A. and school board meetings, volunteering in classrooms, participating in fund-raising, and showing up at back-to-school nights.''
To be sure, there is no substitute for a good teacher. There is nothing more valuable than great classroom instruction. But let's stop putting the whole burden on teachers. We also need better parents. Better parents can make every teacher more effective.

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Golden Years

BYLINE: By EDWARD L. GLAESER. 
A professor of economics at Harvard and the author of ''Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier and Happier.''

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
DR. B. BOOMER -- an unfortunate, but fictional, dentist -- worked and saved for years, only to see her portfolio shrivel after a series of investments in orthodontia-related dot-coms a decade ago. She then put her money into seemingly safe financial firms, like A.I.G., and was hammered during the subsequent downturn. Her plan to retire by selling her Scottsdale McMansion isn't going well either. So the poor woman is spending her 65th year, not in glorious retirement, but fixing fillings for screaming children and generally annoyed adults.
Dr. Boomer is hardly alone. Retirement seems out of the question for increasing numbers of Americans who are saddled with debt and whose savings evaporated during the recent bust. Today's workers should expect to labor longer, and companies should expect to employ more older workers. 
The numbers supply a vivid picture of America's graying work force. Between 2007 and 2010, the number of working Americans over 65 years old jumped 16 percent; the number of under-65's in the labor force shrank. The trend started before the current downturn: the number of Americans over 65 in the labor force increased from 10.8 percent in 1985 to 12.1 percent in 1995 to 15.1 percent in 2005 to 17.4 percent in 2010. Until 2001, most workers age 65 and older had part-time jobs; since 2001, full-time work has been far more common.
Consider the difference between today's extended work life and the average American work life during the mid-20th century in the midst of what was, in retrospect, a retirement boom. Again, the numbers present a vivid picture: from the '40s to the '80s, the percentage of men who were 65 and older in the labor force fell precipitously -- from 47 percent in 1949 to 15.6 percent in 1993. By the 1980s, retirement at age 65 was nearly universal for American workers. Today, however, 36.5 percent of 65- to 69-year-old men are still part of America's labor force. (The number of working women in this demographic is slightly lower.)
Economic downturn plays a big part in shifting retirement patterns. Recessions generally affect work lives in two opposing ways. They decrease portfolio values, which tends to make people poorer and thus in need of income from work. Recessions also mean weak labor markets, which make work less rewarding and less available, which in turn encourages older workers to retire. Dr. Boomer's talents will be in demand as long as teeth rot, so it's not surprising that in her case, the portfolio effect exceeded the labor market effect.
Two years ago, the economists Courtney Coile and Phillip B. Levine predicted that, faced with diminishing job prospects during times of high unemployment, more workers (especially those who are less educated) would throw in the towel and retire, rather than delay retirement to make up the lost savings. History supplied support for their view; older workers who were laid off in the past traditionally responded by leaving the job market altogether.
But lately, labor patterns haven't conformed to historical precedent: recent increases in unemployment haven't encouraged many older Americans into retirement. Why not?
One reason is that as of 2000, Social Security no longer penalizes older workers who continue to earn money. So even though new Social Security awards have soared since 2007, many of those who receive benefits keep working. And there are additional reasons retirement has become less common: work today is far less arduous for most workers, and the elderly are far healthier. Retirement was far more desirable -- if not outright necessary -- for older Americans who worked on blast furnaces or in coal mines.
But today, comparatively few workers over the age of 55 work in heavy industrial fields like manufacturing, construction or mining. By far the largest portion of older workers today work in the education and health sectors. These jobs aren't easy -- just ask Dr. Boomer -- but they beat working in a coal mine. (Also, and not incidentally, there has been relatively little job loss in these sectors; this, too, contributes to diminishing retirement.)
Despite the relative strength of the sectors in which the largest portion of older workers are employed, they -- like the rest of us -- have suffered the repercussions of recession. Today nearly 450,000 Americans 65 and older are unemployed and looking to work. To get an idea of how dramatic a jump this is, consider this: the number of unemployed elderly job seekers has more than doubled in the last four years.
Many older people keep working, or at least continue to look for work, because they feel they can't afford not to. Nearly 40 percent of 55- to 64-year-old Americans don't have retirement accounts. Less than a quarter of this group owns a single stock or savings bond. The median net worth of 55- to 64-year-old Americans has declined during the last years and is now $254,000 (including housing), down from $273,000 just three years ago. American households saved less than 4 percent of their incomes for every year between 1999 and 2008; during this time, thrifty Germans were saving about one-tenth of their earnings. A nation that prefers spending to saving is going to find it difficult to enjoy a comfortable retirement.
IT'S counterintuitive, but the forever work life of older Americans may turn out to be a good thing for young workers. The ''lump of labor fallacy'' envisions an economic order in which there is a fixed amount of work to be done. But we can make more or less, buy more or less, and most important, we can create new lines of enterprise. Over time, growth and innovation can create plentiful new work opportunities. If the economy needed only a lump of labor, the spectacular expansion of America's female work force would have led to vast male unemployment. But it didn't. In fact, the number of working women rose by 87 percent in the 25 years between 1975 and 2000, during which time total male employment also increased, by 41 percent.
Recent studies in Britain and Germany find a positive correlation between labor-force participation among the elderly and youth employment. It's not that older workers never crowd out younger workers, but there are myriad ways in which older workers also increase employment among the young. As older workers earn more, they can afford to buy more products produced by the young. Older workers may be entrepreneurs who employ younger workers, and they may pass along valuable skills to the young.
America has a terrible youth unemployment problem; the Occupy Wall Street movement may be the most visible manifestation of the unrest it has created. The unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds is 15.5 percent; their economic distress reverberates throughout the system. When the young don't earn, they don't marry or buy houses, depressing housing demand and housing prices. Economists have found that people who begin their work lives during a downturn suffer adverse economic consequences for years afterward. We have reason to worry that the current economic slowdown will create a lost generation of Americans who are now in their 20s. But it's a mistake to imagine we can fix the problem of youth unemployment by encouraging older workers to retire.
Almost 60 years ago, when baby boomers were still rattling around in their playpens, my former colleague John Kenneth Galbraith imagined an ''affluent society'' in which we would be able ''to dispense with the labor of those who have reached retiring age.'' It's a source of common sorrow that his words -- and their promise -- turned out to be a mirage. While I feel sorry for every American who, like Dr. Boomer, wants to retire but can't, there is a lot to like in this surge of experienced workers. Longer work lives mean more tax dollars, and that helps with America's fiscal problems. Older workers also bring a diversity of perspectives and experience to the work force.
America desperately needs more entrepreneurship, and by at least one measure, the elderly are often the most entrepreneurial Americans. Self-employment rises significantly with age. West Palm Beach, a retiree haven, has the highest self-employment rate of any metropolitan area in the nation; other areas around the country that attract older Americans boast similar self-employment patterns. Self-employment is particularly natural for older Americans, because it provides so much more control over working hours and conditions. While self-employment is surely an imperfect measure of entrepreneurship, it correlates with other indices of entrepreneurship. I'm not suggesting that West Palm Beach is likely to become the next Silicon Valley, but we shouldn't pooh-pooh the independent economic activity of the elderly, either.
Gradually, our image of 70-year-olds needs to change from Florida retirees to Florida entrepreneurs, who find ways to make a bit of cash doing something a bit more fun than their former work. I've heard Dr. Boomer is considering starting a Web service, with her grandson, selling advice to aspiring Indian dentists. The government can help, perhaps by promoting adult education for 60-somethings looking to learn new technologies, but this will primarily be a private business.
The United States has always had a Calvinist backbone. We've long been comfortable with shorter vacations and longer workweeks. In this light, the mid-20th century retirement boom seems like something of an aberration. In a sense, the current rise in the working elderly is a reversion to form, and perhaps that's not such a bad thing. While some older workers will have to work because they can't afford not to, there remains the sunny possibility that others, like Galbraith himself -- who worked well into his 90s -- will do so because they find fulfillment in their jobs.

HEADLINE: A Culinary Circus, Fresh From the Lab

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
Montclair, N.J.
A MEAL at the month-old restaurant Adara is a three-ring circus -- or five rings, or seven, or even 12, depending on how many courses you order.
Thrill to the amazing mozzarella balloon! Watch in disbelief as hickory smoke rises from your guacamole! Taste the ''deep sea wind'' foam!
And circus may not be the only analogy that occurs to you. The dishes at Adara, with their dazzling palette of yellows and purples, loops and swirls and starbursts, may remind you of canvases in a Matisse exhibition. 
Or, more to the point, the periodic table of the elements. Tre Ghoshal, Adara's 30-year-old chef and owner, has brought to Montclair the scientific techniques and chem-lab equipment of molecular gastronomy, the exacting avant-garde discipline made famous by the Spanish chef Ferran Adria.
Adara's kitchen is filled with aerators, dehydrators, smoke guns, immersion circulators and a fiendish-sounding instrument called the Anti-Griddle, which flash-freezes food instead of cooking it. That sea-wind foam is aerated clam juice; the restaurant's mozzarella balloon, an invention of the pioneering Chicago chef Grant Achatz, is made by blasting carbon dioxide into a ball of cheese curd.
Mr. Ghoshal (pronounced GOSH-ul) cites both chefs as inspirations, along with Wylie Dufresne of WD-50 in Lower Manhattan, and he makes no secret of his ambition to join them as a culinary household name. ''I know I'm young,'' he said in a recent interview, ''but I've spent the better part of my life in the kitchen. I want Michelin stars. I'm ready for it.''
Indeed, he wanted to open Adara in New York but could not raise the financing. A New Jerseyan who had his first high-end cooking job in Northern California, he has been executive chef at several restaurants in his home state, including Nouveau Sushi here in Montclair -- ''a food-savvy town,'' he said, that he hopes will have enough adventurous diners to make his new restaurant a hit.
The early returns have been mixed. On a recent Thursday evening when we dropped in to sample Adara's fare -- not to undertake an all-out review -- only about a dozen of Adara's 52 seats were filled. ''Montclair is very tough on weekdays,'' Mr. Ghoshal said.
Adara (a Sanskrit term for regard and by extension, love) occupies the elegant and comfortable if austere space that was Passionne. Mr. Ghoshal and his crew gave it a full-body makeover, with earth-tone wainscoted walls, burnished-wood floors and, in a corner, a small bar for solo diners or couples.
The restaurant has no liquor license, so the drinks are bring-your-own wine and a neon-lighted lineup of mocktails like the Zengria: green tea, lemongrass fizz, the herb kava kava, and yuzu cotton candy.
Our table did not try the mocktails. There was plenty going on -- if not too much -- on our plates.
We ordered the seven-course ''tour,'' at $105; each course offers a choice of two dishes, so two diners were able to sample all 14. It proved to be a head-spinning array of wildly inventive concoctions, never less than entertaining but often less than the sum of their parts.
The mozzarella balloon, for instance, was part of a dish called Campania. It featured slices of flawless, sweet heirloom tomato and a drizzling of basil in balsamic vinegar -- a timeless combination that benefited neither from the balloon, which had the approximate texture of a rubber glove, nor from a ball of olive oil gelato that lacked any taste of its named ingredient.
Dishes like these are also a great deal of food, when all is said and done: the gelatos and cotton candies and cheeses and creamy bisques that adorn many of Adara's dishes pack a lot of calories. ''Oh, my God,'' a fellow diner said after polishing off a punishingly rich cake of Maytag blue cheese layered with crumbled walnuts. ''We're only through two courses!''
And that can make it hard to keep one's focus and appetite sharp for a third course like duo of duck (duck breast and shredded duck in maki rolls), a fourth like white truffle envelope (truffle pasta enclosing foie gras, with a rousing kumquat mostarda on the side) and a fifth like pork belly with five flavors, including a warm mustard ''ice cream'' stabilized with the thickener methylcellulose.
Our sixth and best course offered a tough choice between two very tender dishes: black cod in porridgelike kanji broth with, among other things, wonderfully sharp-tasting crisped Brussels sprouts; or lamb epice, marinated in harissa and honey and cooked sous vide, with Mediterranean accompaniments like minted goat yogurt, baba ghanouj and only one unnecessary flourish, a tooth-achingly sweet pyramid of preserved-lemon cotton candy (mercy!).
For dessert, an unexpected and refreshing choice is the cucumber-shiso sorbet, though it comes with shards of glasslike yuzu-ginger candy that stick disagreeably to the teeth before melting.
Molecular gastronomy is not a new idea. It broke onto the scene a decade ago, and it has been slow to catch on in part because it is so labor-intensive -- all those gels and layers and emulsions add up to a lot of staff preparation, and high menu prices -- and in part because even sophisticated diners tend to prefer the familiar to the avant-garde. Venue, a cutting-edge restaurant in Hoboken that opened in a much more favorable economy in 2005, lasted just a year.
But like any high-wire act, when it succeeds it can be unforgettable; that is the experience Mr. Ghoshal is hoping to provide in Montclair. As Mr. Achatz, the Chicago chef, put it in a telephone interview: ''The point is to build a sense of 'gee whiz,' of wonder. We want people to say, 'How did they do that?' ''
Adara, 77 Walnut Street, Montclair. (973) 783-0462. restaurantadara.com. Dinner, 5:30 to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday; 5:30 to 10 p.m. Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday. Bring your own wine. Three courses, $59; five courses, $79; seven courses, $105; 12 courses, $165. A la carte entrees, $28 to $38.

HEADLINE: Redefining the Union Boss

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

 BODY:
NOT long ago, truckers pulled off highways across America and tuned in to someone whose CB handle was ''Troublemaker.''
''I'm barely hanging on,'' one driver lamented. His employer, the U.P.S. freight unit, was turning to nonunion drivers -- people outside the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, he said.
''We need to start enforcing our contracts!'' Troublemaker replied.
Troublemaker, better known as Sandy Pope, is the first woman to run for the presidency of the Teamsters, against the powerful, three-term incumbent, James P. Hoffa. 
Yes, Hoffa.
Odds are that Ms. Pope will lose -- final results are due today. But whatever the outcome, Ms. Pope represents a new face of labor, one that increasingly is female. In this ''We are the 99 percent'' moment, when corporate profits are up and wages flat, a handful of women are challenging the old, mostly male world of union bosses.
Unions, of course, have been in retreat for years. But Ms. Pope and several other women, notably Rose Ann DeMoro, of National Nurses United, and Mary Kay Henry, of the Service Employees International Union, are pushing back. Their ascendance has rekindled hope that organized labor maybe, just maybe, could stage a comeback. They have also helped inspire the likes of Occupy Wall Street.
''Some of these women might even make unions relevant to the average American again,'' said Steve Early, a labor journalist, union organizer and author of ''The Civil Wars in U.S. Labor.''
That, anyway, is labor's hope. All three women are pushing the old boundaries, and some are engaging traditional foes like anti-union managers and Republicans in Washington and beyond.
From Big Rig to Bargaining
Ms. Pope is an unlikely firebrand. Her father was an investment banker, and she grew up in comfortable surroundings in a Boston suburb. But then she dropped out of Hampshire College and ended up working for minimum wage as an attendant at a psychiatric hospital. When co-workers groused about wages, she organized a strike -- and won.
''I saw how empowered people felt when they had control over their lives,'' she recalled.
Ms. Pope later found a better-paying job at a warehouse in Cleveland, as a member of the Teamsters. In 1979, when Teamster steel haulers in Canton, Ohio, went on strike, she helped expand that action throughout the Midwest. Before long, she was driving an 18-wheeler, hauling steel from Cleveland to Baltimore. After the birth of her first child, however, she traded her rig for the bargaining table, and began negotiating local contracts. When Ron Carey, a parcel truck driver from Queens, ran on an anticorruption platform and captured the presidency of the Teamsters, a union that had been long notorious for Mafia connections, Ms. Pope became an international representative for the union's warehouse unit. By then, she had settled in Montclair, N.J.
Seven years later, Mr. Carey left after he was accused of misusing union funds. (A court later found him not guilty.) Ms. Pope then joined Teamsters Local 805 in Queens. There, she ran against its incumbent president and won, becoming the head of the 1,100-member local in 2005.
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York tried to convert shipping piers in Red Hook, Brooklyn, into luxury residences and tourist attractions, Ms. Pope called on other unions, neighborhood groups and local leaders to try to block the move. At stake, she said, were hundreds of midwage, non-Teamster jobs. After three years, New York City abandoned the plan.
''We're small, but we fight big,'' she said.
Today, Ms. Pope, still president of Local 805, is worried about the future of freight truckers, once the source of the Teamsters' power. Much of her ire is directed at U.P.S. When the stock market tumbled in 2008, the workers' pension funds became underfunded. On top of that, truckers say, they must now work faster and harder just to keep standing still in terms of wages and benefits.
''Workers are getting killed on productivity standards, and they're terrified to speak out,'' Ms. Pope said.
She worries that her grown daughter can't afford health care, and that her college-age son may not find a full-time job with benefits. ''We're supposed to leave our kids a better world than the one we've been born into, but so far we haven't,'' she said.
If she somehow manages to win the national election, she said, she will fight for all working people. And if she loses? ''I'll keep doing the same.''
Confronting Schwarzenegger
When Rose Ann DeMoro speaks, her voice sounds like a burbling faucet. Ms. DeMoro, 61, is executive director of National Nurses United, a 170,000-member union that she runs with dramatic flair.
Born in St. Louis, Ms. DeMoro married her high-school sweetheart, moved to California and raised two children. She left college to organize supermarket cashiers and was the first female organizer for the Western Conference of Teamsters. In 1986, she was offered a collective bargaining position at the California Nurses Association -- though she had never been a nurse.
At the time, California had fewer registered nurses per patient than most any other state. Night-shift nurses in some hospitals cared for as many as 12 patients at a time, and some bedridden patients would actually dial ''911'' to seek help. In 2004, California passed a law requiring hospitals to have at least one nurse for every five patients. Arnold Schwarzenegger, then governor, delayed implementing part of that law, and at a conference nurses unfurled a protest banner during his speech. The governor told the crowd to pay no attention to special interests.
''I am always kicking their butts,'' he said.
Ms. DeMoro pounced. She said the governor's comment was ''an affront to women everywhere.'' Her union hounded the governor, going so far as to throw a New Orleans-style funeral in Sacramento for the concept of patient care.
After much back-and-forth, the law went into effect.
Greg Roth, a former manager in the California Department of Health Services, dealt with Ms. DeMoro during some contentious legislative hearings. He said she ''is effective, but I didn't feel as if the union showed appropriate respect for the process or for the rights of other people to be heard.''
In more recent years, Ms. DeMoro has helped organize local unions in Texas, Florida and elsewhere, joining forces with other nurse unions to create the national group.
''Rose Ann is not small fry,'' said Mark Brenner, editor of Labor Notes, a nonprofit project that promotes unions through its magazine and Web site. ''The nurses are more in sync with people than most any other group.''
Among other things, Ms. DeMoro has started a movement called ''Heal America, Tax Wall Street.'' Her union wants a 0.5 percent tax on stock trades and credit swaps, similar to those levied in 15 other countries. Such a tax might raise as much as $350 billion a year for health, education and jobs programs.
Critics are vocal, saying such a tax would discourage trading profits, but Ms. DeMoro dismisses them. ''We pay sales taxes every day, and so should Wall Street,'' she said.
To drive home that point, she and 1,000 red-shirted R.N.'s streamed onto Wall Street on June 22 to promote the tax and to protest what they saw as corporate welfare. Two months later, thousands of nurses visited 60 Congressional offices in 21 states, urging support for the Wall Street tax. The nurses also drew media attention by staging a mock news conference with a 10-foot tall puppet that looked a lot like Representative Michele Bachmann, the presidential candidate, and chasing adult-size chipmunks who lugged big acorns to their Wall Street ''nests.''
The nurses' approach has inspired Occupy Wall Street. ''The nurses certainly set an example for us,'' said Andy Pollack, a committee member of that group in Manhattan. Occupy Wall Street protesters have marched with other unions, ''but the nurses go beyond their own contract issues and try to tackle the root of the problem,'' he said.
Ms. DeMoro also recently led nurses from four continents to a Group of 20 meeting in Cannes, France, to lobby for a financial transactions tax in other nations as well.
Wooing the Politicians
Mary Kay Henry, the first woman to lead the two-million-member S.E.I.U., speaks in the measured tones of a diplomat -- a tone she adopted early on.
She grew up in a suburb of Detroit, the eldest daughter in a family of 10. She studied labor relations at Michigan State University and joined the union as a researcher out of college. While rising to the top, she coordinated nursing strikes in Kaiser Permanente hospitals in San Francisco and helped R.N.'s in Seattle negotiate with their employers.
In 1995, after the union's president, John Sweeney, resigned to lead the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Ms. Henry was elected to the S.E.I.U.'s executive board. Mr. Sweeney's successor, Andrew Stern, named her as his assistant in organizing.
Mr. Stern's tenure was not without controversy. Some critics, like Mr. Early, the labor historian, say he did not do enough to look after workers. (Mr. Stern has repeatedly said he has always tried to put workers first.)
In 2005, he led several unions and six million workers out of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., explaining that the old federation had become complacent. He then had a dispute with Unite Here, an organization for hotel, restaurant and garment workers that had split into two factions, as well as with another union.
''It got ugly, and Mary Kay was part of that episode,'' said Mr. Brenner, the Labor Notes editor, and another Stern critic. At one union meeting in Walnut Creek, Calif., Ms. Henry called police to try and eject a dissident union member, but the officers left without doing so, Mr. Early wrote in ''The Civil Wars.''
Ms. Henry was loyal to Mr. Stern, whose successes included increasing the S.E.I.U.'s membership by 1.2 million, and helping to elevate workers, from janitors to home health workers, into decent-paying jobs. He became a political force by helping to funnel $70 million into Democratic campaigns during 2008. When he retired 18 months ago, he backed a top lieutenant, Anna Burger, to succeed him.
But S.E.I.U. members had apparently grown weary of the union's approach. After Ms. Henry stepped forward, Ms. Burger withdrew. In 2010, Ms. Henry was elected president, and vowed to ''heal'' the S.E.I.U.
And now? ''We're on fire,'' she said. She is spending to help locals organize workers in banks, grocery stores and biotech companies and to reach independent contractors.
''We're concentrating on helping those who have no voice at work,'' Ms. Henry said. And she is courting politicians -- and not only Democrats, labor's traditional allies. ''We want the G.O.P. members of Congress to focus on ways out of the economic recession,'' she said. ''So many Republicans leaders are cutting expenses by cutting social services, and that hurts all workers.'' About 30 percent of S.E.I.U. members vote Republican, and an additional 20 percent are independent.
In California, the S.E.I.U. has honed its strategy to an art. It recently started a political action committee aimed at helping to elect moderate Republicans in G.O.P. strongholds there next year -- evidence, if more were needed, that unions like the S.E.I.U. will play a role in the 2012 elections.

HEADLINE: In Such Uncertain Times, A Lighter Shade of Green

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
IF the 2011 Los Angeles auto show could be summed up in a single word, that word might well be ''tentative.'' The economy is lurching, the industry's sales are seesawing and prospects for stability are uncertain.
So the attitude among automakers here seemed to be one of wait and see, making it all but impossible to identify a definite trend or direction. Important new products were unveiled, but they were, for the most part, mass-production models. Bold design studies, and even the whimsical trial balloons that can make an auto show memorable, were scarce.
Notably, the scales this year tilted in favor of exotic cars and high horsepower -- 500 doesn't even warrant a gasp -- a decided shift from the times when Los Angeles was the showcase event for eco-friendly vehicles.
The timing of the Los Angeles event nearly coincides with the industry's model-year change, making it either the last major international auto show of the season or, as others see it, the first of the coming year. 
Officials of the show, which opened to the public Friday after two days of press previews, promised more than 50 new model introductions. (The show, at the Los Angeles Convention Center, is open to the public through Nov. 27.) That total represents a steady, if slow, improvement over the dark days of 2008-9, when the show's existence was in question as the auto industry stumbled into recession and bankruptcy.
''It's an indication of the improving strength, and underlying solid fundamentals, of the auto industry,'' said John Mendel, executive vice president of American Honda, ''that there are more than enough new models in the pipeline to support this, and other major auto shows throughout the year around the globe.''
Honda, which unveiled a redesigned version of its popular CR-V, a compact crossover vehicle, was one of several manufacturers introducing crucial new products at this show. The crossover category is one of the most ardently contested in the market, and the show floor here was evidence of that. Ford took the wraps off its latest Escape, and Mazda entered the fray with a new model, the CX-5.
Still, there were signs of erosion. Floor space that was once packed with millionaires' sports cars sat largely empty this year. Some California-based automakers, including the electric-car companies Fisker and Tesla, skipped the show entirely, even though they have new models that could have drawn potential customers. European brands like Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Volkswagen and Volvo presented mostly warmed-over products that had been shown in September at the vast Frankfurt auto salon.
Several Japanese manufacturers have held back new-product introductions, diverting them to their hometown to help prop up the ailing Tokyo Motor Show, which opens to the public on Dec. 3. The Japanese automakers have had a particularly tough year with the double blow of the earthquake and tsunami last March and the recent flooding in Thailand, which has shut down many of their suppliers and again interrupted production.
Even as the United States government just confirmed new fuel-economy standards that will require significant improvements by 2025, manufacturers here continued to offer shiny new idols to the gods of horsepower.
Chrysler stuffed a new 540-horsepower Hemi V-8, which it calls the 426S, into its 300 sedan; the power plant was described as an ''engineering exercise'' that may or may not go into production. The smart money is on a production green light -- sooner rather than later -- as Chrysler can ill afford to design flights of fancy for which there is no business case.
Chevrolet, while feting owners of its Volt plug-in hybrid here, on the other hand took the cover off a new 580-horsepower Camaro ZL1 convertible. And Ford, not ready to concede pony car horsepower bragging rights to its crosstown rival, introduced a pumped-up 2013 Shelby GT500, powered by a 5.8-liter V-8 making 650 horsepower.
Though the horsepower party must certainly end someday, the horizon was nowhere in evidence here.
Besides new models, some new technologies were rolled out at the show, including a hands-free liftgate on the Ford Escape, a back-up collision intervention system on the Infiniti JX, a new fuel-saving cylinder-deactivation system on the 415-horsepower Mercedes-Benz SLK55 and inflatable seat belts on the updated Ford Flex.
Here are some of the important models on display at the Los Angeles show:
BMW The latest iterations of the company's ''i'' line of electrically propelled vehicles made their North American debuts here. The compact i3 concept is a pure electric car (though it may be offered eventually with a range-extending gasoline engine), while the i8 is a plug-in hybrid. The futuristic i8 is a descendant of the former Vision concept, which has a starring role in the upcoming ''Mission: Impossible'' movie sequel. CADILLAC The flagship brand of General Motors introduced a new flagship model for the marque, the XTS, which shoves aside the DTS and STS. As an antidote for the alphabet soup of a name, which even Cadillac news releases flubbed, just think of it as the new Sedan de Ville.
CHEVROLET The Camaro ZL1 convertible is nothing less than the most potent four-passenger convertible General Motors has ever made. With 580 horsepower pouring out of its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8, the trophy for that title may be retired with this model. It won't be cheap: $54,995 when it arrives late next year.
DODGE Chrysler's SRT performance skunkworks has resurrected one classic model name, the Super Bee, and come up with a new one that sounds like a classic, the Yellow Jacket, for two new 470-horsepower versions of its Charger and Challenger models. Can the Hemi 'Cuda be far behind?
FIATIn Italy, the Abarth name is applied to Fiat 500 models that get souped-up engines, tweaks to the ride and handling, aerodynamic aids and contrasting body stripes. It's a package as compellingly Italian as the new TV commercials for the Abarth. Now an Abarth version of the 500 is coming to the United States, and a power upgrade of about 50 percent will go a long way toward elevating the car's reputation beyond its intrinsic cuteness.
FORD Chevrolet's crosstown rival couldn't resist the temptation to raise the ante in the horsepower wars; a new Shelby GT500 version of the Mustang that smoked its tires for the first time at this show is graced with 650 horsepower. Ford says it is the most powerful production V-8 in the world.
At the other end of the horsepower scale, Ford also unveiled its thrifty redesigned Escape crossover utility vehicle, which will have only 4-cylinder engines. The Flex people carrier is treated to new styling at its front end that might remind onlookers of a kitchen appliance.
HONDA Countering Ford's Escape is a new CR-V, a perennial sales leader in the segment. Supply interruptions helped the Escape to overtake the CR-V in 2011, but the redesigned Honda, which will soon go on sale, should heat up the sales leadership race again. Honda also revealed new details and pricing -- a three-year lease at $399 a month -- for its upcoming Fit EV all-electric hatchback.
HYUNDAI The Korean automaker continues to move upmarket with new offerings like the plush 2012 Azera. The recipe is simple: offer luxury amenities in an attractive wrapper, at a price that undercuts traditional luxury brands by thousands.
INFINITI The JX is a large, luxurious seven-passenger crossover that aspires to break into an already crowded class of generically similar vehicles.
JAGUAR A 550-horsepower convertible version of the XKR-S sports coupe was introduced here as the British marque's most powerful droptop ever. Also, at more than $135,000, it is the most expensive serial production convertible.
KIA The sleek, classy GT design concept was shown in North America for the first time, and it reinforces the goal of Korean automakers to appeal to more affluent customers.
LINCOLN The MKT luxury crossover and MKS sedan are getting mild enhancements -- more horsepower, more torque, more brightwork -- to help these Lincoln luxury loungers sell until it is their turn to be thoroughly updated.
MERCEDES-BENZ Pretty bodies were on display at Mercedes, but auto enthusiasts have seen most of them before. The magic is under the hood of high-performance AMG versions of the ML sport utility, C-Class coupe and SLK roadster. Americans can also drool for the first time over a roadster version of the SLS AMG supercar.
MAZDA The CX-5 actually made its debut in September at the Frankfurt auto show, but it's new to North America. Although it would seem that demand for small crossover vehicles has been sated by the dozens of models already on sale worldwide from various manufacturers, Mazda expects the CX-5 to become one of its biggest sellers.
SUBARU This was technically a world premiere of the BRZ Concept STI, even though the car was also seen at Frankfurt. But enough small changes continue to be made to this sports coupe, conceived in a joint Toyota-Subaru project, that it has continued to seemingly have ''world premieres'' at one international auto show after another.
VOLKSWAGEN Look closely at the nose of the 2013 VW CC sedan; that's about the only place you'll easily notice a difference between it and the outgoing model. The disappointment for many in Los Angeles, where top-down motoring is a birthright -- was that VW did not introduce a convertible version of its updated Beetle.

HEADLINE: Italy Bound

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HEYMAN

 BODY:
Just in time for Italy's 150th anniversary (and a major financial crisis), a flurry of new books present the country as frustrating, inscrutable and magnificent. 
''Rome'' by Robert Hughes (Knopf, $35) A fascinating personal history of the Italian capital, ''Rome'' begins with an exegesis on the founding myth of Romulus and Remus and ends with a rant about how the city has lost its ''Dolce Vita''-era glory. Hughes says Rome has been ''gutted by the huge and ruthless takeover of its imagination by mass tourism.'' Its television is ''crap,'' its civic experience ''brutally compromised by automobile and driver.'' The city that wasn't built in a day (try 2,500 years) refuses to be understood in the space of ''a decade or a guided bus ride.''
''The Pursuit of Italy'' by David Gilmour (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $33) Was Italy's 1861 unification a terrible mistake? Gilmour admits that his ''quirkily subjective'' book grazes unequally on different regions. Tuscany or the Veneto alone, he claims, could ''rival every other country in the world in the quality of its art and the civilization of its past.'' But his final verdict is that Italy was ''predestined to be a disappointment.'' History and geography, Gilmour says, ''made certain countries, including France and Britain, more important than the sum of their parts. In Italy the opposite was true.''
''Mamma Mia'' by Beppe Severgnini (Rizzoli Ex Libris, $23) Severgnini's subject - a certain Mr. B - is the embattled Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, whose taste for philandering, cronyism and forcing Angela Merkel into a game of hide-and-seek is drolly explained here for the author's ''friends abroad.'' Berlusconi seduces Italians, Severgnini says, by behaving like them. ''He prevails by complicity, not example or authority. I am like you: impulsive, intolerant, enthusiastic and impatient.''
''Seeking Sicily'' by John Keahey (Thomas Dunne, $28) This erudite travelogue begins in a chaotic Palermo. The author delights in scruffy trattorias and checks into the Hotel des Palmes, where Wagner finished ''Parsifal.'' Later, he pokes around the underworld, where an anticrime activist says crackdowns are producing unexpected results: ''There are a lot of people here who are more afraid of the police than the mafia.'' Paradox abounds all over Sicily. Keahey sums up the local attitude with a quote from that Sicilian classic ''The Leopard'': ''If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

BEFORE THE END, AFTER THE BEGINNING
By Dagoberto Gilb
194 pp. Grove Press. $24
Where are we when we are before the end yet after the beginning? We are in the midst of life, where everything happens. Before the end and after the beginning, one celebrates a perfect sixth birthday, looks for a job, has an affair, remembers old girlfriends, suffers a stroke. These are the moments Dagoberto Gilb describes in his elegiac third story collection, ''Before the End, After the Beginning.''
Gilb himself had a stroke in 2009, and the story that opens the collection, ''please, thank you,'' appears to be a straightforward personal account. The narrator is surrounded by nurses and family, unable to make sense of the world, unable to hear or to make himself heard. Through the blur, he struggles with his Chicano identity, and is infuriated when people speak to him in Spanish: ''im from here! ill bet my familys been here longer than yours! i was semper fi, cabron.'' (The lack of punctuation is a practical matter: the narrator has lost movement in his right arm, and is lurching at the typewriter with his left.) 
Aside from introducing most of the collection's themes -- Anglo prejudice, nostalgia, loss of dignity, the struggle to succeed in America -- the story also establishes its emotional palette, a subdued rage that occasionally explodes.
Rage has been an abiding element of Gilb's fiction. But the twilight mood of this collection dampens it: the characters are simmering, not storming. ''im not getting soft,'' the narrator of ''please, thank you'' insists. ''i am not wanting to scream and fight as much though, punish the keyboard the way i used to.''
Two bittersweet tales of childhood are especially tender. In ''His Birthday,'' a mother's jabbing candles in the cake contrasts with her son's pure happiness when he's allowed to choose one present at the toy store. In ''Uncle Rock'' (which reprises some themes from Gilb's 2008 novel ''The Flowers''), a slightly older boy catches the baseball at a game and is able to forgive all the men who have tried to steal his mother away.
Other stories feature young adults, and subjects Gilb has explored since his 1993 debut collection, ''The Magic of Blood'': drugs, violence, girls (the white girlfriend, the ex-girlfriend), unemployment. Characters register the constant struggle and unsettledness of being Mexican in America. ''I preferred Billy,'' one character reflects when his aunt tries to call him Guillermo. ''I didn't like to be formal. I didn't want to sound like I just crossed. I liked people to know I was American, born and raised.''
The closing story, ''Hacia Teotitlan,'' brings readers full circle. The protagonist, who has an unnamed illness, returns to Mexico for only the second time in his life. He rents a small basement apartment in Oaxaca, where he walks, eats, reads, befriends some locals and a dog. He reflects on life. He gains some semblance of peace and spirituality. The story also returns to the limbo time -- before the end, after the beginning -- the first story introduced: ''He tried to think, with scientific neutrality, of this life and death. How to take that into his own individual being, his less, his more, his here, his there, his then, his now, his next.'' Time, he says, is ''off and wrong.''
Most of the collection's characters experience time in suspended animation, and live in an oddly inert state in which emotions are neither felt nor not felt: ''He was tired, he wasn't really tired. Was he hungry? He could be, and he could skip it, too.'' Gilb may be describing what it is like to live through a stroke, but he has also discovered an appropriate symbol of the eternal no man's land of the Chicano in America.h

HEADLINE: Rethinking Gang Years, And Choosing Safe Path for 2

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Jordan McKay patiently urged his 3-year-old daughter, Skylah, up the malodorous steps to their fifth-floor studio apartment in the Bronx. To calm her from bouncing herky-jerky on her tiny bed, he got a video going, got her a banana. That did it. Soon, in all her blatant cuteness, she was radiating joy. In this way, a day moved forward.
Settled on his couch, sunlight blinking through the window, he addressed in his quiet, dutiful voice the thick clot of events that had brought him to this room. Only 20, he has already stepped over the line and back. 
His was always a Bronx story. He was born and grew up in the borough, his father an electrician, his mother an employee of the United Parcel Service. Neither parent, he felt, gave him the attention he wanted. They split up when he was 7, and he stayed with his father.
School did not go well, and he searched for status on the streets. He sold marijuana, but found he was not good at it. He associated with three gangs in his neighborhood while never actually joining any of them.
''People join gangs because they're scared,'' Mr. McKay said. ''I was never scared. I knew the leaders to be punks. I never wanted to follow a punk.''
Yet he craved money. He became, in essence, a scout. He would station himself in a park watching for people who seemed worth mugging, passing his selections on to gang members. After robbing them, they would peel off a commission for him.
Then, when he was 17, his girlfriend got pregnant. Telling his parents terrified him.
Figuring his father unlikely to celebrate the development, Mr. McKay locked himself in the bathroom. From under the door he shoved out a sonogram of the baby. His father went wild. Mr. McKay moved to his mother's, who took the news better.
At the end of 2008, having already dropped out of high school and broken up with his girlfriend, he was spent with the gang life and went to Maryland to live with an aunt, a police officer.
Six months later, to be near Skylah, he returned to New York, moved in with his father and found a cashier's job at a Duane Reade. Soon after, two fellow employees drew him into an identity-theft scheme, he said, one of those foolproof plans that never are. Using a customer's credit card number, they bought seven $100 gift cards. Mr. McKay's split was one card and a package of Reese's Pieces (he wanted some candy). He tried to use the card to buy groceries and a Marvel T-shirt, but he could not get it to work.
Security sniffed out the crime, and the three were arrested. He pleaded guilty and was put on three years' probation.
Mr. McKay's off-and-on existence continued. He landed a job pumping gas that quickly ceased to excite him, and he was fired after about six months.
The world chopped by. His ex-girlfriend, who had had a second child by another father, was living with the children in a Brooklyn homeless shelter. In December 2009, she was discovered passed out in the bathtub, having overdosed on Ecstasy, he said. The police arrested her. The other child had been picked up, but Skylah, puzzlingly, was not discovered until more than a day later, hungry and disoriented.
Mr. McKay took her to live with him at his father's place. With a child to raise, he realized his life needed to be rethought. He pursued custody, which he got in April.
Living off unemployment and unable to find work, he could not pay rent to his father. He tried to get into a homeless shelter but found no places available for a father and his young daughter, he said.
Mr. McKay came to the attention of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. It helped him find the studio apartment in the Morris Heights neighborhood -- the rent is $900 a month -- and in September, he and Skylah moved in. Since Mr. McKay owned no furniture, the agency drew $703 from the Neediest Cases Fund to spartanly fill out the room.
Mr. McKay lives on $98.88 a week in unemployment benefits, $141 a month in public assistance, a $250-a-month housing allowance from public assistance and $274 a month in food stamps. As soon as he can get Skylah into day care, he plans to pursue his G.E.D. He hopes to become an electrician like his father, or work in construction.
This year, his probation officer nominated him for a fatherhood award. He is awaiting word of whether he won.
Gang members infest his neighborhood, even his building. He ignores them. They do not scare him. What Mr. McKay wants is simple but hard.
''I'm trying to get to a place where I want to be,'' he said. ''I want a normal life.''

HEADLINE: An Uncomfortably Small, and Shrinking, World

BYLINE: By MARTHA SCHWENDENER

 BODY:
Nothing draws people together like a crisis. The reigning global conversation at the moment -- if one is to judge by newspaper headlines -- is about the worldwide economic mess. Before that, however, the state of our environment dominated our collective consciousness. It is this second issue that is addressed in ''Marina Zurkow: Friends, Enemies and Others'' at the Montclair Art Museum.
Fitting the global nature of our eco-quandary, Ms. Zurkow's work encompasses a variety of geographic regions, and the aesthetic upon which she bases her animations and their accompanying prints is culled from a global range of art history sources. The message one might take from this broad-based approach is that it's an uncomfortably small world after all.
Works from Ms. Zurkow's series ''Crossing the Waters'' from 2006 to 2009 are inspired by the effect of climate change on the world's oceans, which connect and affect us all. ''Weights and Measures,'' from 2007, a simple, nearly three-minute digital animation, shows different objects and organisms floating in a deep blue, oceanic background. There are swimming elephants drawn in white outline, airplanes and iridescent green shapes conjuring plankton or other primordial sea creatures -- as well as cross-sections of human skulls. 
Opposite this video is ''Slurb,'' an animation from 2009 commissioned by the city of Tampa that conflates the words ''slum'' and ''suburb'' in its title. A slow, hypnotic loop lasting nearly 18 minutes, the video is accompanied by an ambient-electronic soundtrack that includes a high-pitched Theremin -- an eerie-sounding instrument that was a staple of 1950s science fiction movies. Visually, the video draws heavily from contemporary Asian sources, specifically Japanese manga and anime (comics and animation), which derive partly from Japanese woodcuts and the Chinese painting tradition.
''Slurb'' includes flat, bold-colored figures in Asian-style boats paddling past half-submerged cars, trailers, bridges and tires. Seagulls fly overhead, toxic clouds waft through the scene, and mermaids and sirenlike figures provide an otherworldly aura to a flooded, postapocalyptic city.
Two more animations from the four-video series ''Elixir'' that is part of ''Crossing the Waters'' are displayed on the lawn outside the museum. Both have orbs, suggesting perfume bottles, drawn in transparent outline at the center of their frames. ''Elixir III'' from 2009 shows a giant revolving perfume bottle placed in the middle of a crashing surf. Inside, a woman, also drawn in outline, flaps a pair of handmade wings in an attempt to fly.
The turning bottle in ''Elixir IV,'' also from 2009, is set in an icy waterscape. Inside this one is the outline of a male figure, a diver twisting and turning in the bottle. With their unlikely juxtapositions of figures and locales and their use of outline drawing, both works recall paintings of David Salle that also relied on a jarring pastiche of images and sources.
The centerpiece of the show is a new series titled ''Friends and Enemies,'' which includes prints and the digital animation ''Mesocosm (Northumberland, UK)'' from 2011. The video is 146 hours long, playing in a looping cycle -- which eliminates the pressure to watch the whole thing. (One downside of video is that you often feel guilty when you watch only a portion of it.) A black-and-white animation, with washes reminiscent of aquatint printing techniques, ''Mesocosm'' features a particular landscape -- Northumberland in northern England -- drawn in solid shapes and calligraphic outlines reminiscent of Asian painting and prints, as well as of contemporary comics, graphic novels and animated films.
Sometimes the ''Mesocosm'' landscape, with a landfill sketchily outlined in the background, is left to the elements. At other times, it is occupied by a large, nude male, borrowed from a Lucian Freud painting of the Australian-born performance artist Leigh Bowery. A pudgy earth father, seen mostly from behind, he sits through the seasons on a tree stump, surrounded by flora and fauna, decay and regeneration.
A series of accompanying prints provides a framework for the epic animation, showing how it cycles through the seasons. If you want to know the moment at which you are arriving on the scene, the upper-right-hand corner of the central image displays the hour, day and month depicted in the video.
The last group of works in the show is a series of prints that, while skillfully designed, are a little hokey and obvious. The ''Heraldic Crests for Invasive Species'' are black-and-white letterpress prints featuring non-native animals that have invaded northern England: the European rabbit, the zebra mussel, the mitten crab, the North American signal crayfish, and plants like Japanese knotwood and Himalayan balsam. Underneath outlined images of the animals incorporated into heraldic crests are Latin slogans like ''Velox et vindex'' (''Swift and vengeful,'' under the bullfrog) or ''Ex nihilo nihil fit'' (''Nothing comes from nothing,'' under the North American gray squirrel). They link nature and culture in terms of their drives toward conquest, legitimacy and -- particularly with the use of Latin, a dead language -- extinction.
This is the first exhibition in the Montclair Art Museum's New Directions program, which showcases contemporary art and is an exciting and promising development. Thanks in part to a glut of graduate programs across the country, there are thousands of innovative and highly trained contemporary artists living today whose works deserve to be seen.
Ms. Zurkow, who is a 2011 Guggenheim fellow, is a good example of an artist hooked into the advanced conversations within her field and the world at large. At the same time, her work takes sophisticated discourses and boils them down to rather simplistic results. She is a safe choice for a museum speaking to a wide audience. (As many contemporary artists have remarked, this is also an issue with the Guggenheim Fellowships program: it favors artists who are high-minded, but not too rigorous or controversial.)
Much of this tendency toward conservatism, which can be seen in museums at large, stems from the ''culture wars'' of the 1980s and 1990s, in which government arts subsidies were cut, curators became targets of litigation, and museums were fearful of mounting shows that might get them in trouble with politicians or citizens.
These reservations notwithstanding, Ms. Zurkow's appearance at the Montclair Art Museum and the museum's hiring last year of Alexandra Schwartz as curator of contemporary art are welcome developments. This is especially true in a world sorely in need of creative ideas and solutions. And it is a potent reminder that artists are a species that is thriving, rather than going extinct.
''Marina Zurkow: Friends, Enemies and Others'' is on view through March 18, 2012, at the Montclair Art Museum, 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair; montclairartmuseum.org or (973) 746-5555.

HEADLINE: No Turkeys Here

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN

 BODY:
THERE are days when it seems -- both in and out of the food world -- that Everything Is Going Wrong. That makes it easy enough to complain, and I'm not alone in doing so routinely. Nothing tastes the way it used to. Even pricey restaurants have lost their glow. Quality is shot. People die from eating melons. The dominance of hyper-processed, industrialized food (and, more to the point, food-like products) is spreading globally, and we're all gaining weight faster than ever, while wrecking the planet.
Nevertheless, it's nearly as easy to find signs of hope -- lots of them -- as well as people and organizations who've been prodding American food back on a natural, sustainable, beautiful track.
Then, of course, there are the things that just plain make you glad to be alive. Aside from the smell of garlic simmering in olive oil, what and whom am I thankful for? In no particular order: 
1. Start -- as many of those involved in the food movement did -- with Marion Nestle, the nutrition and policy guru and an all-around heroine. (Her daily blog, Food Politics, is always worth a look.) Put simply: eat per Marion's advice and you'll be eating better. (You'll probably live longer, too, but as Marion might say, ''the studies are incomplete.'')
2. For low-income people, better eating often starts with WIC and SNAP. It's a shame we need these food assistance programs, but it's great that we have them, and we must fight to preserve and improve them.
3. There are more than half as many farmers' markets as there are McDonald's. The markets are gaining ground, and fantastic groups like Wholesome Wave are making them more affordable.
4. You gotta love food markets like Oakland's People's Grocery and the Park Slope Food Co-op, for their daily demonstration that corporate supermarkets aren't the only way to shop.
5. Hooray for the Environmental Working Group, our best watchdog on misallocated subsidies, ethanol policies and a variety of conservation issues.
6. Let's thank Europe. I agree, Europe is wholly un-American. But food-wise, we have more to learn from them than the other way around. Examples of how to move forward on food policy and agriculture while clinging (if by a carrot paring) to worthwhile traditional ways abound.
7. While we're over there, let's thank H.R.H. Prince Charles, who's smart and outspoken enough to make you reconsider the notion of royalty. A couple of other admirable non-Americans are the United Nations' Olivier De Schutter, a key figure in recognizing and promoting agro-ecological agriculture, and Vandana Shiva, who fights for food as nourishment, not commodity.
8. Back home: Will Allen and the Milwaukee-based Growing Power, Malik Yakini and the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, and Nevin Cohen of the Five Borough Farm are, along with the other pioneers of the urban food movement, making a difference.
9. Journalists. Especially Barry Estabrook (of the blog Politics of the Plate), Tom Philpott (Mother Jones) and Tom Laskawy (Grist), old-school guys who dig up the food stories you need to read. In her blog and her book (both called ''Superbug''), Maryn McKenna routinely scares me half to death. Then there's Raj Patel, a social justice writer who focuses on food; his ''Stuffed and Starved'' is a classic critique of the world food ''system.'' (Raj is also, by some accounts, the Messiah. But I know him and he's not that great.)
10. Can't mention Estabrook (or his book ''Tomatoland'') without a shout out to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, who showed that farmworkers could fight for and win better working conditions.
11. Speaking of fighting, Just Label It and others are involved in the much-needed struggle for better food labeling.
12. If Michael Pollan had done nothing other than say, ''Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants,'' we'd still owe him a great debt. But his new edition of rules (''An Eater's Manual'') features the typically gorgeous art of the great Maira Kalman.
13. We also owe the Humane Society of the United States, Mercy for Animals and PETA (they can be extreme and, I think, even silly, but still...). All decry animal abuse on a daily basis, sometimes at physical risk to their employees. It's tough work; it isn't pretty; but as awareness increases so will the cry for change.
14. For his long-range view and persistence, you have to love Wes Jackson, whose Land Institute is advancing perennial agriculture as an alternative to input-heavy annual monoculture.
15. Few views are as long-range as those of Wendell Berry, who's pushing 80. The farmer, poet, novelist and essayist is a leading voice for sustainability and common sense, and perhaps the first scribe of the food movement.
16. Serious thanks to Bill McKibben, who's trying to keep the earth in good enough shape to grow things on it, and Tim DeChristopher, who put his freedom on the line (and lost it) protesting oil and gas leases on public land.
17. And to Bill Marler, who, as the leading food safety attorney in the country, is trying to keep the things we grow from killing us. Check out Michele Simon on Marler's Food Safety News, too.
18.The Rudd Center has spearheaded the movement for a much-needed soda tax. When that happens ... well, woo-hoo: we'll know that serious and lasting change has come.
19. For better and still improving school lunches, let's thank Ann Cooper (the Renegade Lunch Lady), Kate Adamick, the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act and (why not? it's Thanksgiving) Michelle Obama. (At this point, a nod to the world's most famous walking advertisement for a plant-based diet: Bill ''Mr. Slim'' Clinton.)20. With Washington on the agenda, a shout out to Ezra Klein, the hardworking economics and politics writer whose daily WonkBlog is indispensable. (The food link: I met Ezra when he criticized my mah-po tofu. No one's perfect.)
21. Four D.C. lawmakers with the guts to fight Big Ag: Senators Bernie Sanders (a national treasure), Jon Tester, an organic farmer, and Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Chellie Pingree. There are others, but not enough; next year there should be more.
22. Let's acknowledge all real farmers, stewards of the earth, as well as those fishers and ranchers who get it: there are plenty, and their numbers are increasing.
23. Much movement in the right direction is thanks to groups like Food and Water Watch and American Farmland Trust (''No Farms, No Food'').
24. But you don't need to be a farmer to grow food: check out Roger Doiron and his plan for ''subversive plots'' that will not only lead to greater individual self-sufficiency but will also point to a better way of growing and eating.
25. Finally: Thanks to anyone who's started a small farm in the last five years, and anyone who's supported one; anyone who cooks, and especially anyone who teaches others to cook. In these realms, let's thank FoodCorps, SlowFood USA and Cooking Matters, all doing great work. As are millions of individuals. Bless you.

HEADLINE: In Nevada, a City Hall Is a Reminder of Flush Days

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- The view from the top floor of the new City Hall here stretches for miles. At nine stories high, the building is the tallest around, making it possible to easily survey the pockmarked landscape below. Down there, homes in foreclosure dot nearly every block of the suburban housing that stretches through the desert, just a few miles away from the glittery Strip.
It is not hard to spot the vacant strip malls; several were never occupied at all.
For more than a year, the city has teetered on the brink of insolvency. But last week, officials began moving into the gleaming new City Hall, a building that cost roughly $130 million to build. There are marble floors and granite tabletops, solar panels and scores of televisions, in addition to an outdoor concert plaza. 
Officials have grand dreams about the grand first floor's serving as a one-stop shop for people paying their taxes or getting permits for new homes and businesses. But nobody is quite certain when the lines will start to form. Ask the city manager, Timothy Hacker, if North Las Vegas has hit bottom yet and he answers cautiously: ''We're darn near close.''
As cities across the West grapple with huge numbers of foreclosures and dwindling populations, the North Las Vegas City Hall stands as an odd symbol of the shimmery golden past's contrasting with the murky gray present.
This was once one of the fastest growing cities in the country. It was just two years ago when the Police Department would complain that it did not know of all the new streets (with sunny names like Pink Petticoat and Carefree Beauty). But now the city is perhaps among the most brutally pummeled places.
Nearly a third of all homes are in foreclosure. The houses that are occupied are worth less than half of what they were two years ago. But people here still focus on what it could have been and maybe, just maybe, what it could still be.
This year, the city was facing a $9 million deficit and the prospect that it might not be able to make payroll. State officials began murmuring that they could move to take over the municipality if it became fiscally insolvent. One official said that unless the city ''hit the jackpot,'' bankruptcy was imminent. This fall, the city reached a deal with unions to delay cost-of-living raises, averting a crisis for now.
But the future is still grim -- the city's bond rating was downgraded again last month, and officials acknowledge that they could be in the same precarious position next year, when the city faces a $15.5 million budget gap. They hope that a new veterans' hospital and an outpost of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, will help the economy, but they know those additions will not provide the same kind of quick cash that property taxes once did.
''It will take us 20 years to get to where we were three years ago in terms of collecting tax revenue,'' said Al Noyola, the city's interim finance director. ''We have to get to a point where we aren't relying on housing to drive our engine.''
When North Las Vegas started to draw up plans for the new City Hall some five years ago, cash flow was no problem. The city was hiring more and more workers to deal with the population influx, and workers were jammed up against one another in several gray, squat, 1960s-era municipal buildings. At the time, the plan was to tear down the existing City Hall and build a new police station.
During the good times, the city created parks filled with features that would make even the wealthiest towns envious -- a life-size stegosaurus in one, fully lighted tennis courts in another. It created recreation centers with top-of-the-line equipment and built new libraries in rapidly expanding corners of the community. And it drew up plans for City Hall, with a wellness center where bureaucrats could work out between their civic tasks.
Officials like to point out that City Hall, originally estimated to cost $142 million, is coming in at least $10 million under budget. But the fitness center will sit empty until the city can figure out a way to pay for the treadmills and weight machines it was designed to hold. One solution: wait until they can collect money from employees who pay to use the parking lot covered with solar panels, prized real estate since it shades cars from triple-digit heat.
Most of this is of little comfort to many of the city's residents suffering through the economy, who deride the new building as a Taj Mahal.
''My unemployment is about to run out, and nobody here is doing much to help me,'' said April Miller, 33, as she sat in a local park having a picnic with her husband, Jeremy, and their three young children. Mr. Miller once had steady work as a plumber, but that stopped two years ago. He has had no success with any of the hundreds of jobs he has applied for.
He added, ''It's just disrespectful -- like they have no idea of what people are going through.''
Because of budget cuts, the city has fewer than a third of the employees it had just three years ago, when construction on the new City Hall began. Now fewer than 300 people will move into a building that has the capacity for 1,500. The city plans to rent several offices to another governmental agency.
There are all kinds of statistics that put numbers on the grim news here, in a state that has had the highest foreclosure rate in the country for more than two years. There is the nearly 14 percent unemployment rate, foreclosure rates as high as 33 percent in some parts and a majority of homes worth less than half of the purchase price.
Angel Barajona moved here from Southern California six years ago, buying a three-bedroom home on a new block for $280,000. Now the house is worth about $100,000. Mr. Barajona lost his job as a truck driver two years ago and fears he will have to stop making mortgage payments soon. He ticks off the list of neighbors who have moved.
''Chances are a year from now I won't be here, either,'' he said, taking a break from repairing his car's engine. Open car hoods are a common sight here these days, as many try to save money by acting as their own mechanics, Mr. Barajona said.
With federal money, the city has begun to buy dozens of abandoned foreclosed homes, where plastic tricycles and discarded beer cans sit in the backyards and empty pools are filled with dirt. Contractors repair damaged cabinets and holes in the walls that squatters have left behind, and the city puts the homes up for sale for around $100,000. About two dozen have been sold so far, and two dozen more are expected to be on the market soon.
These days, basic municipal services are more meager -- street sweeping happens once a month instead of weekly, park bathrooms are cleaned less frequently and traffic lights can take more than a week to replace.
Last year, the city considered shelving the plans for City Hall or selling the building and leasing back several floors. But those plans proved untenable -- the officials figured that the city would lose more money than it would make in either scenario.
''Asking me if I want it to be built now is like asking me if I want to have this kid after he got put on restriction,'' said State Senator John Lee, who represents the city and explored the prospects of a state takeover. ''If we get through this, people will look back and say that was the worst thing that could have been done at the time, but the best thing to show our optimism.''

HEADLINE: When Too Many Flat-screens Are Never Enough

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
If an alien with an accounting degree touched down in America, it might conclude that we're a weird cult that spends 11 months living frugally and four crazy weeks buying tons of stuff we don't need. It wouldn't be entirely wrong, either. Retailers make around a fifth of their sales during the holiday season -- close to half a trillion dollars -- when the ratio of frivolous to necessary purchases spikes. It's not unusual for large chains to operate in the red from New Years' Day through Thanksgiving and then make it all up in those crazy weeks.
Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is the single most manic, delirious shopping day of the year and, of course, the official beginning of the holiday-buying frenzy. Holiday binge-buying has deep roots in American culture: department stores have been associating turkey gluttony with its spending equivalent since they began sponsoring Thanksgiving Day parades in the early 20th century. And to goose the numbers, they've always offered huge promotions too. 
Black Friday relies on a few simple retail strategies that, with tons of customer data and forecasting software, have become fairly precise. One method is to sell everything as cheaply as possible and magnify a tiny profit through volume. Other stores mark down only a few high-profile items -- even selling them at a loss -- in hopes that customers will also throw a few full-priced items in their carts. Regardless, Black Friday is essentially a one-day economic-/stimulus plan and job-creation program. Retailers use TV commercials and deep discounts, rather than tax breaks and infrastructure spending, but the effect is the same: billions of dollars, which would otherwise never be spent, make their way into circulation.
In some years past, big sales on Black Friday have meant a good year for the retail sector, which makes up about a fifth of the U.S. economy. (This year, retailers are predicting a so-so year, with just tiny growth in sales.) But lately, the data have been much harder to read. On a spread sheet, broke people buying on deep discount look an awful lot like people who feel flush, but they're not the same thing. In the recent recession, solid Black Fridays have been followed by lousy sales once the special offers went away. It's another indication of how hard it is to understand the real state of our economy and what we can do to make things better.
One attractive approach to the latter would appear to be effectively having a few months of extended Black Friday discounts. In theory, it's a way to end an economic downturn: when the economy slows, consumers stop spending. Then businesses slash prices, people buy at discounted rates, warehouses empty and business picks up. But this cycle was a lot easier to maintain before, roughly, 2001, when the United States so dominated the global markets that it also determined the cost of raw materials. When U.S. sales fell, global commodity prices followed. As a result, American companies could lower prices on consumer goods without firing a lot of workers or cutting their pay. But not any more: demand from China, India and Brazil, among others, is now sending the prices of oil, grains, metals and other commodities higher than ever. U.S. companies -- stuck with a higher bill -- have cut costs by laying off workers rather than by slashing prices. This holiday season, for example, retailers have the smallest number of workers per sales dollar in the last decade.
While Black Friday can be an amazing stimulus for one day, it can be destructive if it goes on too long. The main problem with an extended period of price discounts is that if companies end up with lower profits from smaller margins, they may need to fire even more people, thus raising unemployment even further and making shoppers even less likely to spend. If they go on too long, deep discounts could also lead to one of the scariest phrases in economics, ''a deflationary spiral,'' in which consumers and businesses are in a miserable stalemate -- not spending, not hiring. When everybody expects prices to keep falling significantly, things get worse. Why shop today if everything will be cheaper tomorrow? Why build a new factory and hire workers if profits are just going to fall?
There is, however, a way to achieve a healthier, extended Black Friday. It also results in consumers shopping and businesses hiring, but, paradoxically, it's achieved through raising prices rather than cutting them. And it is truly one of the other scariest words in economics: inflation. Like a defibrillator, inflation is a blunt tool that, used exceedingly sparingly, can sometimes save the patient. The Federal Reserve can create inflation by pushing more dollars into the economy, a huge influx of which makes every dollar we have worth a bit less.
Most of the time, the rate of inflation is so low that we barely notice it. When it's out of control, as it is right now in Zimbabwe, it makes money effectively worth nothing. But a bit of extra inflation can work miracles. With, say, 5 percent inflation -- a bit more than double the current rate -- $100 today will only buy $95 worth of stuff next year. That's frightening, which is the point. We actually want consumers to realize that prices are rising and that money in their bank accounts is losing value if they don't start spending. The same goes for companies too, which will be compelled to build and hire rather than sit on earnings, as many are now.
These days, the inflation solution is a hot topic among policy experts and economists, both liberal and conservative. Some Democrats think of it as a sort of back-door stimulus -- because Congress won't pass President Obama's jobs plan. For a few Republicans, it's a way to prod the economy without increasing government spending or debt. And then there are other economists who point out the rather obvious downsides: inflation, once it starts, can get out of control. Rising prices without new hiring would make people worse off. Weimar Germany's hyperinflation led to Hitler; some blame inflation in the United States in the '70s for giving us disco.
Even without these memories, inflation is a tough sell. It's nearly impossible for politicians to tell Americans that their financial problems will be solved once the money in their wallets is worth less. (This, after all, is why Rick Perry threatened violence on Ben Bernanke.) Yet the biggest advantage, and somewhat terrifying disadvantage, to inflation as a policy tool is that it can be instituted without any politicians' involvement. The Federal Reserve Board can meet and make some decisions, and pretty soon we'll all see prices start rising.
In our bizarro economic world, where inflation can be good and discounts can be bad, the best long-term hope for the future might be the thing that most terrifies us. If emerging-market nations in Asia and Latin America develop a strong middle-class majority -- as of now, they still haven't -- the United States will have less power and influence. But it also means that if our economy slows down again (and one day it will), American companies will be able to rely on consumers in Brazil and China without having to spur shoppers with extra inflation or deep discounts. There shouldn't be anything scary about that.
Thanksgiving-dinner talking points:
1. Broke people buying on discount isn't the same as consumer confidence.
2. The way to get people to spend more money every day (at least for now) may be to raise prices, not lower them.
3. Time to start rooting for China and Brazil!

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Judging the Health Law

 BODY:
Readers react to a letter saying the health reform law is reasonable and needed, and should be upheld by the Supreme Court.
The Letter
To the Editor:
As expected, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide the constitutionality of the new health care reform law (''Justices to Hear Health Care Case as Race Heats Up,'' front page, Nov. 15).
Rejecting ''slippery slope'' diversions (''If the government can 'mandate' that everyone buy insurance, why can't it also require that we eat broccoli?''), the court should focus on the powerful argument that the new law represents a reasonable approach to serving the national interest.
The health system urgently needs reform. For individuals, the delivery system must be improved to provide quality care more reliably than at present. Sick people need access to affordable care early enough in an illness to get well and to avoid more expensive services. 
As a country, we spend far more on health care than other countries -- even though about 50 million Americans are uninsured -- yet our health statistics are worse than most other industrialized countries and our citizens are less satisfied with our system than those from other countries are with theirs.
Surely it is in the national interest that our population is healthy and that we compete successfully with those countries whose health care systems are less expensive but more effective than ours.
The new law may not be ideal, but it is a rational attempt to achieve important goals. It will not only reduce the number of uninsured and increase access in the short run, but also create conditions that facilitate the long-term process of reforming the delivery system. And, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, it would produce savings over 10 years.
Finally, not incidentally, it did pass Congress! The sad history of health care reform efforts means that starting over is not an option.

Readers React
Mr. Davidson's letter reflects the view I held as a health policy fellow serving in the Senate as the Affordable Care Act was being put together. I no longer hold to the tenets that support this legislation.
I do not understand how providing (mandating) health insurance for 34 million currently uninsured Americans will increase access to health care unless there is a dramatic and rapid increase in the number of health care providers.
I do not understand how insuring more Americans will reduce our total health care costs over the next 10 years.
Starting over, as Mr. Davidson said, may not be an option. But starting with an articulation of the real issue might be: Is health care a civil right? The answer to that question ought to have been the starting point in Congress as the debate over health care reform began in 2009.
Instead, the question I observed being debated on Capitol Hill was how the various health-related constituencies and their lobbying groups would preserve their current revenue streams.
LEONARD A. ZWELLING Houston, Nov. 17, 2011
The writer is an oncologist.
The health care ''mandate'' is clearly constitutional. Indeed, it's misleading to call it a mandate at all. Everyone already uses health care services. The new law merely regulates how we buy them.
The rational way to pay for health care is to carry insurance, as most Americans do. Those who don't freeload in various ways such as going to emergency rooms, pushing the costs on taxpayers and those with insurance. The new law just changes how we buy care to make the system fairer, more rational and more cost-effective.
IRA MARK ELLMAN STEPHEN D. SUGARMAN Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 17, 2011
The writers are law professors, at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, Arizona State University, and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively.
The individual mandate is the glue holding health care reform together. Already, some of the other mandates in the law are causing health care premiums to increase. My individual coverage (I'm self-employed) just increased another 10.5 percent to almost $700 per month. Just for me! And, I'm healthy as a horse.
Unless everyone ''gets in the pool'' to spread the risk, costs will continue to skyrocket and I'll have to make a decision as to whether my health coverage is something I can afford.
I realize this is not a ''point of law'' that the Supreme Court will necessarily consider, but, really, how can it not?
SHERRIE MATZA San Francisco, Nov. 17, 2011
Health care reform passed Congress because it had the least impact on our current erratic delivery of health care while adding some minimal improvements. The law does not make sufficient progress toward what should be our goals -- universal access, prudent costs and high-quality outcomes.
Reform we can believe in requires structural changes. Removing the financial barriers to access will require a single-payer system and dedicated national funding. By glossing over the dysfunctional aspects of our system, the health law delays real reform. For that reason we should welcome the Supreme Court's striking it down.
MARVIN J. MANTYK Detroit, Nov. 17, 2011
The writer, a former manager at a health insurance company, is an adjunct instructor of health care economics at Davenport University.
The government has the right to mandate actions of its citizens -- paying taxes, fighting in the military during past wars, sending our children to school and so forth. Buying health insurance is just another required action. Why does the distinction that it is a commercial action matter?
CHRIS GILBERT Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 17, 2011
Insurance should be about risk, and thus it is not the obligation of those who decline to buy insurance -- not because they plan to game the system, but because they intend to pay for their own health care -- to subsidize those at higher risk by buying a commercial product. The individual mandate is thus immoral and unfair. On that basis, the Supreme Court must reject that provision of the health care bill.
Of course, in a nationalized system, payment of taxes toward at least primary care at a universal level is sensible and fair. How we get from here to there, with the challenge of partly dismantling the entrenched insurance businesses and at a time of deficit reduction, is extremely daunting. But implementing the Affordable Care Act, which is neither fish nor fowl, just compounds the present problem.
TONY PERCY Southport, N.C., Nov. 17, 2011
We should not lose sight of the origin of the individual mandate, which is now being challenged as unconstitutional by free-market conservatives. It was their brainchild.
It was entertained by the Nixon administration, embellished in 1989 by the conservative Heritage Foundation, proposed as a law in 1993 with 19 Republican sponsors, including Bob Dole, and included as a key part of Mitt Romney's Massachusetts health reform in 2006. Somehow, the conservatives' position flipped in 2009 when President Obama adopted their idea.
Both liberals and conservatives have seen it as essential to spreading insurance risk in a market-based system. Strident complaints that it unconstitutionally expands federal power raise strong suspicions of cynical partisanship.
ROBERT I. FIELD Philadelphia, Nov. 17, 2011
The writer is a professor at Drexel University's Earle Mack School of Law and School of Public Health and the author of ''Health Care Regulation in America.''
I'm not a praying man, but I'm praying that the health care law is upheld. It's the best we have been able to do in all the years of health care debate.
For those of us who are uninsured, it at least offers a glimmer of hope for affordable insurance independent of employers. Because when I lost my job, I lost my insurance, and I certainly can't afford it at this stage of my life and with pre-existing conditions.
If all those people with employer-sponsored insurance could step back and imagine what it's like to live on the edge without it, they'd realize that having all people in the risk pool is the only way the system can work.
HARRY ZWEIER Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Nov. 17, 2011
It's simple isn't? The mandate boils down to two choices:
1. We all participate and spread the cost, or
2. You opt out and let someone else pay your fair share.
Right now, I'm helping pay for those who cannot and those who will not. For those who cannot, I have sympathy; for those who will not, none at all.
TOM MOSES Bellingham, Wash., Nov. 17, 2011
The Writer Responds
Because delivery system change won't occur overnight, several writers conclude either that the law shouldn't have passed or that it won't achieve its goals. Indeed Mr. Mantyk argues that it passed only because it has ''the least impact'' on the current system. Dr. Zwelling thinks that because primary care capacity will be insufficient to meet increased needs, the law won't accomplish much good.
I agree that many hoped-for benefits will not emerge until delivery system changes take hold. But if instant delivery system change is the criterion, reform legislation could never be justified. The perfect can't be the enemy of the good.
Some oppose the mandate because they think that those who ''decline'' to buy insurance shouldn't be subsidized by those who buy it -- although the essence of insurance is shared risk, and many can't afford even inadequate coverage despite working several jobs.
Opponents with that view focus only on the individual dimension (too ungenerously for my taste), forgetting that the aggregate impact of individual decisions by doctors, patients, insurers and others creates the sorry picture I described.
If all agree that we need more reliable and less costly care, why haven't those who could produce it not already done so? The answer: Current conditions don't encourage or facilitate such change.
But the new law has elements that should move us forward. For one, insurers wanting to participate in the market will need to find new ways to keep down their costs, like investing in new payment methods, stronger care organizations and information technology.
Since the new law will increase access to care for millions and create conditions that can lead to delivery system reform, I believe that it is an accomplishment that should be celebrated.

MYCOPHILIA
Revelations From the Weird World of Mushrooms
By Eugenia Bone
Illustrated. 348 pp. Rodale. $25.99
Hedgehogs, fairy clubs, hawk's wings and candy caps: these are just a gladeful of the fungal eruptions that have captivated Eugenia Bone, the intrepid -- when not encountering grizzly bears -- author of one of the most beguiling books I've read this year. A generous sprinkling of amateur photos only adds to the charm of ''Mycophilia.'' I was especially taken by a black-and-white snapshot of 30 sturdily dressed mycophiles trotting briskly en masse across a field, heading toward the day's quarry: delectable, hard-to-find morels. Some morel-pickers, Bone informs us, carry extremely tiny baskets -- because they don't want to alert the mushrooms to their intentions. 
Bone figures that a thousand or so of America's mushroom connoisseurs can be classified as pros: a wandering community of commercial pickers who hunt out harvests of porcini, matsutake and chanterelles from British Columbia to Northern California. (The West Coast comes out tops where North America's mushrooms are concerned.) The remainder -- including bankers, surgeons, academics and off-the-gridders -- are obsessed (and often pretty delightful) oddballs with whom Bone proves adept at building up a nonchalant rapport.
Take the plaid-shirted mountain man she encounters during a mushroom-seeking flight to Montana, ''mashed into his window seat like a raccoon stuffed into a too-small Havahart trap.'' Along the way, he tells Bone how to stuff morels with cream cheese, crab and shrimp, then ''slow smoke 'em over mesquite and serve 'em with elk.'' But Bone isn't easily upstaged. A few pages later, she casually observes that morels on braised cabbage formed part of the last repast of the first-class passengers aboard the Titanic.
Weird details, combined with a flair for startling analogies, brighten even the most rambling passages of Bone's book. She may not know precisely how to communicate why it's O.K. to chew, but never digest, a deadly Amanita phalloides, but set her on the hunt for fungi in the aftermath of a forest fire and Bone can make you shiver in the slovenly vacuum of a campsite she compares to a cold fireplace. Follow her, one misty morning, along the path to a forest pool and she'll paint the scene in one adroit phrase: ''Fog hung like laundry over the trails.'' While not quite a match in pithy summary to Basho, the Japanese mycophile and haiku maker, Bone deploys the precise, uncommon vocabulary of the best naturalists.
Still, why on earth would we novices, while happy to let Bone and her chums traipse the woods and mountaintops, want to read about what, for most of us, is best enjoyed on butter-drenched toast? Do we thrill to the news that eating a candy cap mushroom can cause every pore of the body to exude the scent of maple sugar? Do we really want to know that a single mushroom, three to four inches across, can produce 100 million spores in an hour -- and that if all the 14 trillion spores of a basketball-size giant puffball bore fruit, the earth would be knocked out of its orbit? Does it intrigue us to learn that of the 1.5 million species of fungi that exist, only 5 percent have been identified?
The answer, as I'm now persuaded, is yes. Bone's enthusiasm would prompt even the most languid armchair ecologist to take a new interest in the role played on our planet by mushrooms, which are the ''fruiting body'' of fungi, our evolutionary kin -- of which the largest is an awesome living monster that covers 2,200 acres of forestland in eastern Oregon and weighs 6,286 tons. (Though I'd love to know how such an exact figure was ever gained.)
Each and every fungus contains properties that, as described by Bone, sound almost magical. Growing up the toxic walls of the abandoned nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, fungi learned to fight its lethal radioactivity by the production of melanin. A network of tiny fungi, delicate as a baby's shawl, can play a crucial role in feeding a giant tree. In an inspired image, borrowed from the mycologist Paul Stamets, Bone draws an analogy between the Internet and a forest linked and nurtured by an underground tracery of fungi that ''function as pathways for shuttling nutrients, water and organic compounds.'' More remarkably, the fungi can differentiate among all those trees and meet the unique requirements of each one. As Bone smartly states, ''It's a couture service.''
I'm lodging only one complaint. While most authors overburden us with personal details, Bone doesn't offer enough. She mentions, in passing, a sister's circus connections. And she describes her father entreating two startled tourists in Florence to approach the pocket of his jacket and take a sniff: ''Come on, smell it!'' (He'd been on a truffle walk that afternoon.) The paternal image is memorable, but tantalizingly slight. While eloquent on the subject of mushrooms, about its author Bone's book is frustratingly self-effacing.
Three final trophy facts. For $299 (plus a yearly fee of $69), you can buy your very own French ''truffle tree'' and lay claim to any truffles found beneath it. Mushrooms are an extremely rich source of vitamin D. And any overweight mycophile (the mountain man plainly wasn't bothered by his size) can lose pounds almost painlessly by substituting mushrooms for meat. Remember, however, that the modernist composer and intrepid mycophile John Cage once economized by subsisting solely on wild mushrooms, a brief experiment that ended in the hospital, with Cage suffering from a case of malnutrition.
Consider yourself warned against any such absolutist diet. But not against the nourishment on offer in Eugenia Bone's delicious, surprising and dizzyingly informative book.

HEADLINE: Southern Hospitality, but Not for Newcomers

BYLINE: By YUNTE HUANG. 
A professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the author of ''Charlie Chan: The Untold Story of the Honorable Detective and His Rendezvous With American History.''

 BODY:
IMAGINE this: It's Sunday morning, beautiful and quiet, except for the mockingbird practicing comic routines on the sweet gum tree in the backyard. As usual, you get ready and drive your family to church. Everyone is well dressed, and the kids are singing in the back seat.
Somewhere along the way, you spot a stranger by the roadside, carrying a Bible, looking lost. As a good Christian, you pull over and offer him a ride. In the car, you introduce him to your family, making sure your kids know their manners. You chat with the stranger. Chances are, he's from somewhere else, maybe even another country. You drop him off near where he's going; or, God willing, he'll come, on your invitation, to your church for the service. If the latter, it will make your day, having welcomed a stranger into the benevolent fold of the Lord. 
That stranger could have been me, 20 years ago, in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Fresh out of college in Beijing, I had left my home country in the wake of the Tiananmen massacre. Landing in the sleepy college town, I was disappointed that Times Square was nowhere to be seen. I started going to churches, and without a car, I had to rely on good Samaritans for rides on Sunday. A newbie not yet brazen enough, I always carried a Bible, which seemed to work better than a hitchhiker's thumb. When kindhearted folks -- men in immaculate suits and women in puffy, flowery dresses -- stopped for me and asked what church I was going to, I would invariably say, ''Yours.''
If the same scene is played again today, you, the good Samaritan, could be in trouble. According to an Alabama law that went into effect on Sept. 1, it is a crime to knowingly give an illegal immigrant a ride. In reality, I was kosher as far as my immigration status was concerned. And even if I were not, you might walk away scot-free because you didn't know I was illegal. But after Gov. Robert J. Bentley -- who in January apologized for saying after taking office, ''Anybody here today who has not accepted Jesus Christ as their savior, I'm telling you, you're not my brother'' -- signed the immigration law in June, you probably wouldn't stop for a stranger like me, kosher or not. And that's one of the problems with the law -- its mean spirit. It goes against a basic tenet of Christian belief: ''Help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you'' (Leviticus 25:35). But that's not my only beef with the law.
The reason I chose Alabama out of all the states was very simple: it's alphabetically the first. It may sound incredible, but in those dark days after Tiananmen, when Beijing reeked of blood and horror, I was so desperate to leave the country that I simply did not care where I was going. I went to the university library and opened a guidebook to American colleges. Lo and behold, there was ''Alabama'' on the first page. (Sorry, Wyoming.) As much as I found Tuscaloosa to be almost unbearably provincial -- think of leaving Moscow and ending up in Moscow, Idaho -- I never regretted it.
Alabama, with its tall pines, red clay and festering swamps, was a land under a charming spell. As I learned to appreciate the rich history and culture of the Deep South, I also figured out a problem: race. Yellow, I found, was not a visible color in a society where everything had for more than two centuries been black or white.
Falling into such a racial vacuum was not, however, without advantage -- call this the yin-yang of racism. Before xenophobia began to cast a different spell on the South, the folks were courteous, warmhearted, always ready to help out a stranger, as my hitchhiking amply proved. Even in my closest brush with the law during those years, I walked away with a profound admiration for the kind of hospitality characteristic of the South.
That was after I bought a car, a beat-up Toyota hatchback, for a whopping $500. One night, I did what I now know as a ''California rolling stop'' near the university campus. A patrol car seemed to zoom out from nowhere, and I was pulled over. With scenes of ''My Cousin Vinny'' fresh in my mind, I was more than a bit scared. I tried my best to sound apologetic and remorseful to the approaching policeman in his brown uniform and shining boots. To my surprise, he was very courteous, addressing me as ''sir'' in a pleasant, melodic drawl. After checking my license, and sensing there were no drugs or alcohol involved, he gave me a warning and let me go. (He didn't actually wave me off with a ''roll tide,'' as a recent commercial comically portrays, but you get the drift.)
Such a comedy of manners -- my Chinese politeness and his Southern chivalry -- might not play out today in Sweet Home Alabama, because the new law allows the police, even in a routine traffic stop, to arrest anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant. Just imagine the paranoia that would have pervaded the situation, both the policeman's suspicion and the driver's fear. Or when, a year later, out of economic necessity, I wanted to open a Chinese restaurant in town and went to city hall to apply for a business license. The clerks looked at me as if I were fresh off the boat, but never thought to inquire into my immigration status. They were just happy that there would be a new business in town, a place where they could order egg rolls and sweet and sour pork.
I'm waxing nostalgic because I miss the time when the sweet Southern air was, at least for this immigrant, not poisoned by fear, the malevolent phobia that haunts Dixie today. The new law is as much an ineffective solution to economic woes as a xenophobic reaction by an already bifurcated community to the arrival of new immigrants, be they Asians or Hispanics. As Charlie Chan might have asked, ''What in the name of Confucius happened to Southern hospitality?''

HEADLINE: Reading Between The Poverty Lines

BYLINE: By TERESA TRITCH

 BODY:
A new and improved gauge of poverty, released this month by the Census Bureau, shows that 49.1 million Americans are poor, and that the ranks of those just above poverty are larger than previously believed. The middle class is under pressure, too, battered by stagnating incomes and unavoidable expenses like medical bills.
The older, official poverty line is still used to determine eligibility for government benefits, but the new formula offers a broader view of life both in and out of poverty. These numbers bear directly on issues of joblessness, budget cuts and health care costs -- and more broadly on the question of whether government policies to help the poor and boost the economy do any good. The answer is an emphatic yes. 
If only lawmakers were paying attention. Instead, they are fixated on budget cutting, generally downplaying the good that government programs do while ignoring the consequences when they fall short.
However you slice it, the definition of poverty is abysmally low. In the new formula, called the supplemental poverty measure, the poverty line, based on the cost of food, shelter, clothing and utilities, is $11,282 for an individual and $24,343 for a family of four, slightly higher than the official threshold.
To determine who is poor, both the official and the supplemental formula count cash income, generally from work or welfare, unemployment benefits, Social Security and investments. The supplemental measure also includes the value of tax credits for low-income workers and noncash government benefits, like food stamps, subsidized school lunches and housing aid, while subtracting necessary outlays, like medical spending, taxes, commuting and child care.
The chart compares the share of Americans at various income levels. The difference between the measures reflects the effect of government benefits, taxes and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as the change in the poverty threshold itself.
The poor make up 16.1 percent of the population under the new formula, compared with 15.2 percent by the official measure -- a difference that works out to about three million people. It's telling that by the new measure there were 3.2 million fewer children in poverty and one million fewer people in extreme poverty precisely because government benefits aimed at those vulnerable groups are indeed helping. But even taking benefits into account, the poverty rate for children is still 18.2 percent; it's 22.5 percent under the official measure. Poverty among the elderly, however, is greater by the supplemental measure -- 15.9 percent versus 9 percent officially -- largely because out-of-pocket medical costs and other expenses swamped the noncash benefits, like food and housing assistance, that some people over 65 receive.
The low-income group -- 98 million Americans by the new measure -- is bigger partly because millions were lifted above the poverty line by government benefits. For example, without the earned-income tax credit for the working poor, six million more people would have been poor last year. Another factor is Americans falling out of the middle class -- those who make too much to receive poverty-related benefits but shoulder expenses that eat into income. The data, on balance, show that the bigger low-income group owes more to families being reclassified downward than to families being lifted up.
The profile of the well off also changes with the new measure. Families with four times the supplemental poverty threshold or more -- $97,372 for a family of four -- were 17.3 percent of the population in 2010 compared with 35.8 percent under the official measure, largely because taxes, medical expenses and work-related costs eroded income.
There are many lessons to draw from this picture. As long as the economy is weak and joblessness high, antipoverty programs -- like food stamps, jobless benefits, Medicaid and tax credits for the working poor -- must be extended and shielded from across-the-board budget cuts. At the same time, Americans need a spare-no-expense effort to create jobs and retrain sidelined workers. Tax reform should ask more from the wealthy and the financial sector to begin to distribute the burden more progressively. Health reform should be accelerated to reduce crushing out-of-pocket medical expenses.
And as bleak as the census data already are, they tell us nothing about the huge debt burden and lack of assets facing millions of Americans, problems that can shackle a family's future. They don't consider the loss of trillions of dollars in home equity to foreclosures and plummeting home values. Nor do they reflect the loss of retirement savings because of rocky markets or early withdrawals by unemployed workers.
This broader crisis calls for even greater policy changes, like loan modifications and enhanced consumer and investor protections to restore trust and stability in financial markets.
We have known for a long time what Americans need to weather the bad times. The question since the recession began is whether Congress will deliver remedies that are big enough, timely enough and consistent enough to help Americans struggling to hold on.

HEADLINE: Black Lawmakers in the South See Statehouse Influence Wane

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
ATLANTA (AP) -- An overwhelming allegiance to the Democratic Party has left black lawmakers in the South without power in Republican-controlled state legislatures, according to a new report.
The nonpartisan Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies said in a report issued Friday that despite Barack Obama's election as president, black voters and elected officials in the South have less influence now than at any other time since the civil rights era.
''Since conservative whites control all the power in the region, they are enacting legislation both neglectful of the needs of African-Americans and other communities of color,'' the senior research associate, David A. Bositis, wrote in a paper titled ''Resegregation in Southern Politics?'' The center, based in Washington, conducts research and policy analysis, particularly on issues that affect blacks and other minorities. 
Mr. Bositis said legislatures were increasingly divided along racial lines -- making Republican synonymous with white, and Democrat with black. The report said a majority of Democrats in both legislative chambers in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi are black. In half of the Southern legislative chambers, blacks are a majority or near-majority of Democratic members.
It is a phenomenon unique to the South, as a majority of black state lawmakers serving in legislative bodies outside of the region belong to the party in charge, the report says.
''That's one of the costs of putting all your political capital in a single party,'' said Merle Black, a professor at Emory University in Atlanta, who is researching the rise of the Republican Party in the South. ''When the Democrats were in power, there was a period there when black lawmakers were very influential.''
That era is over, at least for now, Professor Black said.
''Unless the Democrats can work out some kind of deal with the Republicans, the issues that African-Americans want to get passed along would have to have enough support among Republicans to pass them,'' he said.
State Representative Barbara Ballard of Kansas, chairwoman of the Democratic Caucus in the Kansas House and president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, said Southern black lawmakers who find themselves on the margins of power need to get more creative to remain effective.
''When you have smaller numbers, you work harder and you work smarter,'' said Ms. Ballard, who has served in the Kansas House for 19 years. ''We still have to represent our constituents. Just because someone else is running the agenda, if we weren't there, they would totally control everything.''
Chris Jankowski, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the federal Voting Rights Act as applied to redistricting had led to the consolidation of a main voting bloc in the Democratic Party: blacks.
''The effect of that is, in the South, to weaken the ability in the party to compete in other districts,'' Mr. Jankowski said. ''It does have an unintended but very clear impact on Republican prospects.''
Before the 1994 midterm elections, nearly all black lawmakers served in the majority. Even before the 2010 midterm elections, about half of the black legislators in the South were in the majority, the report said. Now, about 5 percent are in the majority.
And of the 318 black legislators in the South, only 3 are Republican, according to the center.
''Virtually all black elected officials in the region are outsiders looking in,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: A Pioneer at Heart

BYLINE: By PETER K. MILLER. 
As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
I GREW up in East Falls, a neighborhood of northwest Philadelphia. My father spent his career as a radiologist, working and teaching at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. My mother, who was a nurse, stayed at home to raise my three siblings and me.
My older brother followed in my father's footsteps and became a radiologist at the same university. But even at an early age, I was interested in the business world. Around second grade, I collected day-old newspapers from neighbors and tried to sell them, at a discount, to others in our neighborhood. That was not really successful. 
After high school, I went to Trinity College, in Hartford. I was an economics major, but my true interest was playing soccer and lacrosse; I was captain of both teams.
I met Karen, my future wife and best friend, at Trinity and started a business with a friend to sell food at the student pub on campus. First we sold pizzas, then sandwiches, which made us more money. I loved everything about our business, which we called PM Delights, down to buying dozens of fresh sandwich rolls every day.
When I graduated in 1983, I joined Procter & Gamble. I worked in its paper division, selling brands like Bounty, Charmin and Pampers. The job meant going to supermarkets and convincing managers to offer and display our products.
After five years there, I enrolled in the M.B.A. program at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. As I was about to graduate in 1990, I accepted a job offer from a major consulting company. But that night I began thinking about being on the road constantly when my wife was about to have our first child. And I realized that I wanted to run a business, not tell others how to run theirs.
The next morning, I called to turn down the job. Then, while scrambling to find another possibility, I met Tony Vernon, who was recruiting on campus for Johnson & Johnson. I was sold when he told me that the company ran its operating units in a decentralized way. Tony, now president of Kraft Foods North America, became a lifelong friend and mentor.
I worked at J.& J. for 15 years, overseeing brands like Tylenol, Pepcid AC and Duragesic, and serving as president of two operating companies. When I left in 2004, I started medical clinics in retail pharmacies with a friend, Hal Rosenbluth. We created Take Care Health Systems, and I became C.E.O. Three years later, we sold the business to Walgreens. I stayed on as C.E.O. for three more years, and we expanded the operation to more than 350 clinics nationwide.
In 2008, I was asked to join the board of OptiNose, a company started by a Norwegian doctor-and-wife team who created a nasal delivery device in which the patient's own breath propels a drug to the upper part of the nasal cavity. I helped the founders raise $50 million in capital to develop our first products. I left Walgreens in 2010 and became C.E.O. of OptiNose that year.
We moved the headquarters to Yardley, Pa., near Philadelphia, from Oslo. I've been in my element because I love creating something new. I've been able to use my coaching and mentoring skills, and my experience, to assemble 17 wonderfully talented people who are working together to get federal approval and market this new system of delivering drugs.
The device will be tested in clinical trials starting later this year. It holds the promise to bridge the barrier between the nose and the brain, enabling new treatments for difficult-to-treat conditions, including Alzheimer's, depression and Parkinson's.

HEADLINE: Accessible, From All 4 Corners of the World

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
THERE are still places where 18th Avenue, as it runs through Bensonhurst, looks like the Italian-American stronghold that it once was. Spaced at intervals along the street, also known as Cristoforo Colombo Boulevard, are businesses like Gino's Focacceria, the Bari Pork Store, S.A.S. Italian Records and the Villabate Alba bakery.
But just as in Little Italy across the East River, Italian-Americans are now in the minority. Even the Feast of Santa Rosalia, a summertime tradition honoring the patron saint of Sicily, which has been held on the avenue for decades, was canceled this year, for the first time in memory. Destination restaurants in today's Bensonhurst include Spicy Bampa, a Szechuan restaurant two blocks from Gino's where the Chinese-Americans who have come to dominate the area flock to a fiery hot pot buffet.
On a recent afternoon Larry Cricchio, the sales manager at Re/Max Metro, a real estate office on 18th Avenue, flipped through a box of files for his recent residential sales in the neighborhood. Nearly every buyer, he said, was a family of Asian origin. 
Not that other ethnicities don't have a presence in this sprawling neighborhood in the southwestern part of Brooklyn, covering roughly one and a half square miles from 14th Avenue to Bay Parkway and 65th to 86th Street, said Marnee Elias-Pavia, the district manager of Community Board 11, which represents the area. The population today, she said, also includes Russians, Poles, and immigrants from Latin America and the Middle East. And notably, in a spot known in the 1980s for racial tension, Ms. Elias-Pavia says the changes haven't really made waves.
''We all live together peacefully and respecting one another,'' she said, ''and we've come a long way.''
Broadly speaking, according to Mr. Cricchio, the 18th Avenue area is popular with Asians, while the neighborhood's northern blocks, adjacent to Borough Park, are prized by Orthodox Jews, and the southern blocks, closer to the ocean and the Bath Beach area, are a draw for Russians.
Devon Palmer, who rents an apartment on 65th Street between 16th and 17th Avenues with his wife, Agnes, sees the area's appeal as universal: ample public transportation, low crime, solid schools and enough businesses to make shopping and going out convenient. The Palmers pay $1,000 a month for their one-bedroom apartment, but they are looking for a house nearby and hoping to pay $600,000 to $650,000.
Mr. Palmer, a personal trainer who travels to meet clients, values the accessibility of the D and N trains, the Belt Parkway and the Gowanus Expressway. And when he is at home, he said, he feels a sense of security.
''I can leave my doors open, or leave my laundry in the dryer, and come back and it's there,'' he said. ''The trust within the neighborhood is there.''
Mr. Palmer, who is originally from the Caribbean, said he appreciated the area's increasing diversity, and also timeless pleasures like driving to a park on Gravesend Bay, going for a walk and enjoying the sea breeze.
John Intoci, an associate broker at Fillmore Real Estate who has lived in Bensonhurst for about 30 years, says that a tranquil pace of life -- along with wide streets and low buildings with ample space for light to pour in -- has always been the big draw to Bensonhurst.
Beyond that, he said, the area's new residents have added something of their own. ''There's more flair, more flavors,'' he said, adding, ''It's really getting cosmopolitan, I believe.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Housing stock in Bensonhurst is eclectic, but relatively consistent in scale. Though most buildings are two or three stories tall, some are detached and others are not. Many are brick; some have driveways.
City government changed the zoning on about 120 blocks at the neighborhood's eastern edge in 2005, and on a swath of Dyker Heights, adjacent to Bensonhurst on 14th Avenue, in 2007. In both cases, the intent was to control new development that many residents found to be out of context.
''What we were seeing was developers buying parcels of one- and two-family homes, knocking them down and building larger buildings,'' Ms. Elias-Pavia said. The new zoning did stem overdevelopment, she said, though the Department of City Planning has resisted calls for even greater changes in other parts of the district.
Mr. Cricchio of Re/Max said the slower economy of recent years had played a big part in stopping new development.
''When the market changed,'' he said, ''a lot of the builders were stuck with units that they built and were priced too high, and that they couldn't sell. Everything was going crazy around here from 2004 and 2005 all the way up to 2008.''
The buildings remain and units are now selling, he added, but at sharply reduced prices. In general, though, Mr. Cricchio said the neighborhood had not been hit as hard by the downturn as other parts of the city, in part because of steady demand from the area's newer ethnic populations.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Joe Azar, a vice president of Citi Habitats, says that two- and three-family houses predominate, and that even a one-family house will often include a small rental unit with a separate entrance. Multifamily houses with parking typically cost $650,000 to $900,000, he said, though a handful do sell for more than $1 million.
As of mid-November, according to data from Brooklyn's Multiple Listing Service, there were around 50 one-, two- and three-family houses for sale.
One-family houses, Mr. Azar said, average $550,000 to $600,000 -- more if they come with parking. Detached houses also typically have higher asking prices than attached ones, brokers said, and houses on larger lots, of 40 by 100 feet, also sell for a premium.
One-bedroom rentals found on Craigslist run $1,000 to $1,200 a month, two-bedrooms as much as $1,400.
WHAT TO DO
Besides 18th Avenue, the other strip with stores and restaurants is 86th Street, the southern boundary.
Seth Low Playground, at the corner of Bay Parkway and Avenue P, has swings and basketball and handball courts. Bensonhurst Park -- actually just outside the neighborhood's traditional boundaries -- is on 17.5 acres straddling the Belt Parkway next to Gravesend Bay. It has sports fields, a senior center and a promenade with a view of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The Dyker Beach Golf Course, where city residents can play at a reduced rate, is just outside the neighborhood at 14th Avenue and 86th Street.
THE COMMUTE
The N train runs east and west across the area just above 64th Street, stopping at 62nd Street, 18th Avenue, 20th Avenue and Bay Parkway. The elevated D train, which follows New Utrecht Avenue and then 86th Street, cuts diagonally from the northwest corner of the neighborhood to the southeast.
Residents say the train ride to Manhattan generally takes 50 minutes or less using express trains, but track work can increase that time considerably. Ms. Elias-Pavia says major work on the D line -- a total rehabilitation of the Bay Parkway station and improvements at seven other stations -- has slowed service for well over a year. It is expected to be finished in the spring.
''It's problematic now and we complain about it,'' she said, ''and we're undergoing a terrible amount of inconveniences. But at the end of the day there's going to be improvements in the line.''
THE SCHOOLS
Public elementary schools include No. 204 on 15th Avenue, where 70.9 percent tested at or above grade level in English, and 80.3 percent in math. At No. 186, on 19th Avenue, 56.4 percent met standards in English, 71.1 percent in math. The percentages at No. 128, on 84th Street, were 40.6 in English and 67.3 in math. At No. 205, on 20th Avenue, they were 53.5 and 73.6. And at No. 247, on 21st Avenue, they were 77.7 and 91.6.
Public middle schools include Junior High School 227, on 16th Avenue, where 29.3 percent met standards in English on recent tests, 66.6 percent in math.
At the Brooklyn Studio Secondary School, which serves students in Grades 6 through 12, 47.8 percent of tested middle-school students were proficient in English, 76.5 percent in math. In 2010, SAT averages were 426 in reading, 419 in math and 418 in writing, versus 437, 460 and 432 citywide.
At New Utrecht High School, on 80th Street, averages were 409 in reading, 471 in math and 407 in writing, and at Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School, just north of the neighborhood on 20th Avenue, they were 387, 492 and 377.
THE HISTORY
The area was developed beginning in the 1880s by James Lynch, who bought land from the Benson family. According to the Encyclopedia of New York City, the population grew sharply after 1915, with the Fourth Avenue subway. Italians and Jews leaving the Lower East Side came to dominate the area in the early 20th century, and waves of immigrants from Naples and Sicily arrived after World War II, Chinese and Russians in the 1980s.
Racial tensions between black and white residents came to a head in 1989 when Yusef Hawkins, a black teenager, was killed by a gang of white youths.

HEADLINE: What Do Courtesans Do by Day?

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
TORONTO
THE French filmmaker Bertrand Bonello has a term for movies that take place in a single setting: brain films. ''I call them that because the location is like your brain,'' Mr. Bonello said. ''It's like when you go inside a theater or a cinema, and you shut the door: the outside doesn't exist anymore. Very quickly you allow yourself a lot of associations of ideas. You get lost, and you come back, geographically but also mentally.'' Think, he said, of ''The Shining,'' which evokes claustrophobia within the vastness of an empty snowbound hotel, or ''Elephant,'' which circles the endless corridors of a doomed high school. 
A kindred atmosphere of simultaneous immersion and disorientation defines Mr. Bonello's fifth feature, ''House of Pleasures,'' which is set almost entirely within a brothel in fin de siecle Paris. A world unto itself, it plays multiple roles in this fever dream of a movie: a place of business (''Shall we have commerce?'' goes the standard opening formality), a locus of fantasy (Champagne baths, a live panther on the sofa), a prison, a salon, a stage. Called ''L'Apollonide'' when it had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, the movie initially bore the English title ''House of Tolerance'' but has been renamed by IFC Films, the American distributor that is releasing it this week.
In an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival in September Mr. Bonello, 43, came across as soft-spoken and thoughtful -- his English is cautious and precise -- nothing like the enfant terrible that some critics have made him out to be. (Outside Europe he is known mainly for inciting occasional controversies at Cannes, starting with his 2001 film ''The Pornographer,'' which scandalized some with its hard-core scenes.)
Mr. Bonello said that after his 2008 film, ''On War,'' about a filmmaker named Bertrand who becomes involved with a pleasure-seeking cult, he wanted to make a movie in which he could more fully explore group dynamics within a single environment. A few years earlier one of France's periodic public debates about the reopening of brothels had inspired the idea of a movie set in a present-day bordello. Mr. Bonello's wife, Josee Deshaies, the French-Canadian cinematographer who has shot all his films, suggested returning to the subject but in a historical context.
''Bertrand was scared to do a period movie,'' she said recently by phone from Montreal, where she was shooting a documentary. ''He doesn't like folklore. He doesn't like froufrou. But I thought it could be good to go back into the heart, almost the cliche, of France.''
For Mr. Bonello, costume films are typically lifeless pageants -- ''full of dust,'' as he put it. ''To give the feeling of something contemporary,'' he said, ''I wanted to show the little details, to show the weight of things.'' He scoured whatever documents he could find: police archives and nonfiction studies like the French journalist Laure Adler's ''Daily Life in the Bordellos of Paris,'' which evoked the mundane rituals of these women, along with the ever-present threat of violence and disease.
''The main research was what do these women do during the day?'' Mr. Bonello said. ''What do they eat, and at what time, and how do they wash?''
From Manet's and Degas's nudes to Toulouse-Lautrec's depictions of Paris nightlife, prostitutes were common subjects for 19th-century French artists. Mr. Bonello and Ms. Deshaies scrutinized many paintings, including lesser-known ones, not with an eye to recreating tableaux vivants but in search of telling details: attire, poses, the quality of light. (This is important for a film set behind closed doors at the dawn of the electric age.) In ''House of Pleasures'' electric lamps are used in the luxurious parlor, where clients mingle with the ladies of the evening, while the upstairs quarters are illuminated by candlelight.
One thing that links the vast body of art and literature about courtesans is an almost exclusively male perspective. Mr. Bonello and Ms. Deshaies sought to complicate the voyeurism implicit in many of these works. ''We asked, 'What if we were in the women's point of view looking at men looking at them?' '' Ms. Deshaies said. ''You have to be pretty strong to just know that you're there to be looked at.''
Only when the casting was complete did Mr. Bonello have a full sense of the characters. ''I was obsessed with finding faces with a lot of personality, and it really was about putting together a group, not casting individuals,'' he said of the young actresses in the ensemble, most of them relative newcomers.
He wrestled with the question of how to portray what happens in the private chambers. ''Sex scenes in a brothel are so expected that they could be very boring,'' he said. ''I went much more into theater, fetishism, a kind of play.'' Masks and mirrors are ubiquitous; one prostitute mimics a marionette, while another dresses as a geisha and speaks pidgin Japanese. ''These things can tell you more about power relationships than a faked sex scene,'' he added.
Extending the metaphor of brothel as theater, he likened the madam in ''House of Pleasures'' to a director committed to putting on a nightly show and consumed by the logistics and economics of doing so. (She is played by the director and actress Noemie Lvovsky, and many of the customers are also played by filmmaker friends, including Xavier Beauvois and Jacques Nolot.)
While shooting in a single location (a castle outside Paris) helped capture the plight of the characters -- a midfilm trip to the country, a plein air painting come to life, only emphasizes the women's confinement -- it also posed a challenge to the filmmakers. ''There wasn't much space, and we knew it could get too theatrical,'' Mr. Bonello said. ''So I found the space in time.'' The film flashes back and forward, replays scenes and sometimes splits the screen into triptychs and quadrants. He and Ms. Deshaies also decided to keep the camera in discreet, near-constant motion, maintaining a rhythm independent of the performers.
From the fablelike opening line -- a prostitute murmurs, ''I'm so tired, I could sleep for a thousand years'' -- to the jolting epilogue in present-day Paris, ''House of Pleasures'' amounts to a riff on the adage about prostitution being the oldest profession. Mr. Bonello compounds this sense of timelessness with soundtrack choices that could be called anachronistic, starting with his own minimal electronic score. (A trained classical composer, he writes his own music, and, in lieu of rehearsals, gives his actors CD mixes.) After one of the women dies of syphilis, her grieving friends hum the melody to the spiritual ''Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child'' and then slow-dance to the Moody Blues ballad ''Nights in White Satin.''
While his new film has earned Mr. Bonello his best reviews in France (and a spread in French Vogue), there was some hostility from the English-language press in Cannes, even an accusation of ''cruelty porn'' from a British paper. His detractors complain about sexual violence: In ''Tiresia'' (2003), a transgender prostitute is blinded before becoming an oracle (as in the Greek myth), and in ''House of Pleasures'' one woman is the victim of a horrific face slashing. But Mr. Bonello said he never resorts to gore for shock value. ''I show some things because it's necessary to understand the pain,'' he said. ''I'm never doing it casually.''
He is upfront about the personal nature of ''House of Pleasures.'' L'Apollonide, the name of the brothel, was also the name of the house where he grew up in the south of France, the child of bohemian parents who treated their home as a salon for writers and painters. ''I think all my life I've been running after these people,'' he said. ''It's something I'd love to recreate but it's impossible now.''
He described his next film, about disillusioned young people bent on seeing Paris in flames, as ''a kind of action movie.'' Given Mr. Bonello's distinctive recurring obsessions -- the mysteries of the body and the mind, the power of the aesthetic and erotic imagination -- chances are it will be a brain film as well.

HEADLINE: Re-engineering New York: More Than a Sci-Fi Dream?

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
At an urban-planning conference last week, Mary Ann Tighe, a prominent commercial real estate broker and glamorous presence in any room full of people who think about sewage flow, aligned herself against a certain strain of traditionalism. The most powerful woman in New York, according to a recent ranking by the business publisher Crain's New York, Ms. Tighe lamented returning home from China to a skyline she now views only in the quaintest terms.
''I always think to myself, what a romantic 20th-century city,'' Ms. Tighe told the audience. Implicit in her comment is the notion that to compete with Guangzhou we must look like Guangzhou. I suspect that this is a woman who doesn't watch ''Annie Hall'' and get wistful. 
Positioning New York for 21st-century global supremacy has been a preoccupation of the Bloomberg administration, and one central to the mayor's vision of greatly expanding the technology sector by ratcheting up elite science education. The city is reviewing seven proposals from 17 universities and research institutions (Stanford and Cornell are among those that have forged alliances) bidding to create an applied sciences and engineering campus here -- one that could spring up on Roosevelt Island or at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, among other potential locations. The city is offering land and up to $100 million in capital to achieve all this.
It is also providing us with an invitation to imagine what New York would look and feel like as a kind of mid-Atlantic Silicon Valley. Is it even possible to mastermind such a world?
The city already has tech enclaves around Union Square and most notably now in Dumbo, Brooklyn. But of course there are reasons to remain skeptical of any future evolution. ''Regions around the world have tried for decades to replicate the Silicon Valley experience, without success,'' AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor of urban planning and dean of the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, told me. ''There are also world-class technical universities all over that don't generate ongoing commercial innovation and economic growth.'' (And research generally, in the aggregate, loses money, as some economists will tell you.)
At the same time, Northern California's Silicon Valley, Boston's Route 128 and Austin, Tex., have all emerged as technology centers through some combination of major universities, Cold War government research money and proximity to venture capital. New York doesn't have much in the way of military-financed research and development, but as a major medical center it has hundreds of millions of dollars flowing to it from the National Institutes of Health. James Parrott is an economist who now focuses on issues affecting New York State, but he wrote his dissertation on the emergence of Route 128's tech corridor and he is optimistic about the city's plan. ''It is a model anyone would follow,'' he said.
The mythology, and partial truth, of Silicon Valley is that genius was birthed in so many attached garages. In New York we don't have garages, we have underground labyrinths that take $400 a month from us to park a car 10 blocks away from our apartments. But we do have places for businesses to grow, once we think about New York as a city that extends beyond Upper and Lower Manhattan.
The South Bronx, for instance. The soon-to-open Sunshine Bronx Business Incubator seems like an apt model for what could come. It occupies part of a floor in the 420,000-square-foot BankNote Building, a former currency-printing plant in Hunt's Point, which was erected in 1909 and is virtually impossible to describe without sounding like a Corcoran brochure. It has clean lines, high ceilings, enormous windows, sweeping views of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and the city beyond, and it is fairly easy to get to, transportation being key to the blossoming of any tech hub.
After an application process and for $195 a month, technology entrepreneurs and other self-employed workers can join Sunshine and avail themselves of a mod, meticulous office space with video-conferencing facilities, open desks, private cubicles, conversation areas, healthy vending-machine snacks, continuing education, camaraderie. The model is a co-operative, and the point is to help people foster allegiances both within their fields and outside them, so that the guy working on a software start-up has ready access to the intellectual property lawyer, who, in turn, can easily find someone to develop her Web site. Those considered to be lacking the correct spirit of fraternity face being expelled.
The Bronx site was opened in part with a modest investment from the city's Economic Development Corporation. The rest came from Sunshine, whose founders, Cheni Yerushalmi, an Israeli immigrant, and his Iraqi best friend, Joseph Raby, have been running similar sites in NoHo and TriBeCa. The company has helped give rise to Zipmark, a mobile and online payment company; the Vitamin Creek, an online supplier of nutritional supplements, and Atlassian, a $600 million software company; it also owns a retreat for its members (called ''shiners'') in Vermont. Given the warehouse stock, the city sees the southern part of the Bronx as a place where tech businesses (and coworking particularly) could really flourish.
Beyond that, though, it is the city's goal to create a whole population of engineers, men and women whose skills could serve all manner of industries. After the financial crisis, Seth Pinsky, president of the Economic Development Corporation, told me: ''We went out to hundreds of people through the city and we asked one simple question. We said, 'Put resources to the side; what would have the most dramatic impact on our economic competiveness?' '' Over and over again, the answer was engineering talent. Mr. Pinsky, for his part, would like to see New York become a center for rapid prototyping, which involves the development of sophisticated machinery that serves, essentially, as a three-dimensional printer for product models.
And what if it did? What if legions of engineers lived among us? What would they wear? Where would they eat? What kind of space would they take up in our imagination? Would we ever get to a point, say, where the Engineer Living in Fieldston was as much of a cliche as the Writer Living in Brooklyn, the Editor Eating at Michael's, the Fund Manager in the Fifth Avenue Apartment?
''New York just doesn't feel like an engineering town,'' a friend, a native and astute observer of the city's culture, remarked to me recently. I wanted to disagree, but in truth, I couldn't.

HEADLINE: Leveraged Moveouts

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM

 BODY:
WHEN real estate was booming, many New Yorkers joined in the rush to turn their houses and apartments into ATMs, withdrawing cash through home-equity loans, or flipping them.
Now, with property values under pressure and the rental market on fire, they are trying a new move to pull value out of their homes without selling: they are renting out their roomy apartments and stately town houses for high prices and moving into cheaper, more modest quarters.
The owners of these places have set aside anxieties about leaving their homes and the potential for property damage, preferring to focus on the upside: sizable profits.
''People are willing to pay astronomical rents, especially for elegant New York City properties,'' said Gary Malin, the president of Citi Habitats. ''There's a huge demand for luxury rentals, but also a lack of inventory, especially because there's so little new construction.'' 
One businessman has moved his family from a grand SoHo loft to a cramped two-bedroom in the West Village so that he can afford to spend a couple of years starting a business. In Brooklyn, owners of elegant brownstones and graceful Victorians are turning their houses into bed-and-breakfasts.
''These places allow people to rent the dream of New York City living,'' Mr. Malin said. ''Compared to living in a white box in a glass tower, these places feel much more like home. There's more charm and character, more intimacy. A town house that's been renovated and furnished is a unique home, with lots of character. Many of these places are offered fully furnished, so it's like walking into a lifestyle. It's like living in a movie set.''
Seven years ago, Michael and Christine Belotz bought a 3,000-square-foot loft on Grand Street in SoHo, a three-bedroom space with a library and a sunken master bedroom, and accented by soaring ceilings, oversized windows, freestanding columns and maple floors. A rainbow assortment of mosaic tiles decorates the bilevel great room; painted Mexican tiles brighten the artist's studio; and brilliant blue Turkish tiles form the backsplash in the kitchen, which has a breakfast bar.
''We thought we'd live there forever,'' said Mr. Belotz, who is 49 and used to work as a research director for a hedge fund. But a few weeks ago, the couple put the loft on the market as a furnished rental for $12,500 a month, and moved with their two young sons to a 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom in the West Village, for which the rent is $4,200.
''It's a much tighter squeeze,'' Mr. Belotz said, ''especially with two little boys. But the financial upsides are considerable. The rent we'll get from the loft equals the mortgage and maintenance on the old apartment, which is about $8,000 a month, plus the rent on the new one.''
If they get what they are asking, Mr. Belotz, who was laid off from his job two years ago, will be able to pursue a professional dream -- helping start an investment management firm.
''I needed to make sure money wouldn't be a problem down the line,'' said Mr. Belotz, who plans to stay in his new place a few years. ''The pieces all came together. Our place is by far our biggest asset, and we wanted to find a way to monetize it. It's a little crazy here right now, and I definitely miss the loft. But I feel good about the decision.''
This kind of rental phenomenon is still somewhat under the radar, especially in Brooklyn, where some owners are renting out their brownstones for a year or two, and others are converting their homes to bed-and-breakfasts.
The presence of a high-profile tenant can make an owner tight-lipped. Sometimes the owner has moved into a sublet that isn't exactly legal, or worries that the decision to rent out all or part of a house will be perceived as a last-ditch effort to avoid the sheriff. Still, when an owner turns landlord, the news spreads fast over stoops and backyard fences.
''I know a few people who have done this,'' said Sharon Barnes, a former board member of the Society for Clinton Hill, a Brooklyn community group. ''People bought when prices were very high, and didn't realize they were in the midst of a bubble. They sometimes stretched as much as they could to buy the properties, and when the market started to soften, the mortgage and tax payments became extremely challenging.
''They couldn't walk away,'' Ms. Barnes said, ''because they had a lot of equity and actually love their buildings, but they were squeezed. So renting temporarily, and taking a smaller space, sometimes in their own building, became a viable way to protect their investments.''
In Brooklyn, with its handsome row houses and sprawling Victorians, the bed-and-breakfast option is especially popular. Last year, for example, Merrie Handfinger, a fabric artist and chiropractor, transformed her cornflower-blue house in Ditmas Park into Handfinger's Hide-Away, a B-and-B where, for $150 a night, guests are cosseted in an environment rich with quilts and original art.
''We bought the house in 2001 for more than $500,000,'' said Ms. Handfinger, 60. ''It's now worth almost double that. But given this recession, I worry about the future. My husband isn't so well. This is something that assures us some income.''
Just in her neighborhood, she knows eight other people who have gone the B-and-B route.
One property that comes with the trappings of an elegant lifestyle is a four-story limestone town house in Washington Heights, steps from the historic Morris-Jumel Mansion. A century old, the house has original wainscoting, pocket doors, tin ceilings and stained-glass windows. The rear garden is dominated by an unusual sculpture by David Hammons called ''Higher Ground,'' in which a basketball net sits atop a 30-foot-high pole made of bottle caps.
Pedro Noguera, a sociology professor with four children, bought the house for $1.5 million when he moved to New York University from Harvard in 2003. His wife died three years later, and when the children grew up and began leaving home, what had been ideal for a family began to seem like a burden. By the time of Mr. Noguera's remarriage in 2009, to Allyson Pimentel, a psychologist and yoga instructor, ''the house was really starting to feel cavernous,'' she said.
''The house was like having another kid,'' Ms. Pimentel said. ''I used to say to Pedro, 'You really have five children.' ''
University housing was the obvious alternative, and last spring the couple moved to Washington Square Village, an N.Y.U. complex, where they pay $3,100 a month for an apartment with three bedrooms and an office. Their Washington Heights house is now occupied by seven nursing students from New York-Presbyterian/Columbia, who pay a total of $6,000 a month for the luxury of individual bedrooms and a 10-minute commute to class. The rent covers the couple's mortgage, which is $5,000 a month, along with utilities, taxes and repairs.
''It took just a week to find the nurses,'' Ms. Pimentel said. ''There was a ton of interest. Plus, we're paying for housing about half of what we were paying before.''
The couple's furnishings are split between their places; a red lacquered chest with brass fittings is among the many pieces inherited from Ms. Pimentel's grandparents that ended up downtown. And they are savoring their new lifestyle.
''Being able to walk to work,'' Mr. Noguera said, ''I gain back two hours of my life every day.'' A super handles maintenance for the house. And with a baby due in April, Ms. Pimentel is glad to have an elevator.
''We also have the house on the market for sale,'' she said. ''But if the market continues to drop, we're happy to just keep renting it.''
At the other end of Manhattan, Robert Curtis, a lawyer, is asking $35,000 a month for his five-story house on Duane Street in TriBeCa. Built in 1830, his home has 4,500 square feet of space, including a fully equipped office with seven workstations and a roof deck with a greenhouse and a conservatory. An open circular staircase winds to the top floor; many of the interior walls are brick; and some of the high ceilings have exposed beams of Southern pine. There are 16 large windows. Other amenities include a lavishly appointed chef's kitchen and a personal gym.
The house comes with a baby grand piano, a thousand books and Mr. Curtis's collection of works by TriBeCa artists. It is so well equipped, with everything from sheets to Baccarat crystal, that a tenant could walk in and start living there immediately.
Mr. Curtis, who is 68 and lives in the house with his Siamese cat, Butch, plans to spend the next year at his turn-of-the-century farmhouse in upstate New York. His move is motivated by a combination of moral, practical and financial concerns.
''On the one hand, living alone with a cat in a 4,500-square-foot house in TriBeCa, and also owning an equally large house upstate, felt morally wrong,'' said Mr. Curtis, who is winding down a 25-year practice representing clients in suits against lawyers. ''Knowing the number of people in trouble and financially underwater, that started to bother me.''
Mr. Curtis also wants the time and quiet to investigate new professional ventures, something that is easier to do in a rural community. And he needs a financial cushion that will allow him to shift gears. Renting his house for a year or so will provide one.
''Do the math,'' he said. ''For this house, I have the maintenance, taxes, utilities and insurance, along with huge mortgage payments. I also have expenses on the farmhouse. It all adds up.''

THE ANGEL ESMERALDA
Nine Stories
By Don DeLillo
213 pp. Scribner. $24
The older you get, the more jarring it can be to turn on the news and behold newly minted pundits sounding off on the import of dramatic changes rocking the nation -- pundits who look as if they're barely out of high school. How do these youthful commentators come by their rapid-fire insights? Does somebody tweet them their lines? Is there a meme? Don DeLillo takes this sense of generational perplexity one absurdist step further in ''Hammer and Sickle,'' the longest of the nine excellent stories in ''The Angel Esmeralda,'' the first collection of his short fiction. 
In that story, published last year in the midst of our confidence-shaking era of economic instability, the inmates of a minimum-security prison gather in a common room every afternoon to watch two little sisters, ages 10 and 12, deliver the daily stock market report on a children's television channel. Effortfully, and with deadpan delivery, the girls spin the headlines. ''The word is Dubai,'' one says. ''Markets are sinking quickly.'' The other elaborates, ''Paris, Frankfurt, London.'' In a jaunty back-and-forth, they trade lines: ''The DAX index in Germany.'' ''Down more than 3 percent.'' ''London -- the FTSE 100 Index.'' ''Down.'' ''Amsterdam -- ING Group.'' ''Down.'' ''The Hang Seng in Hong Kong.'' ''Crude oil. Islamic bonds.'' ''Down, down, down.''
One of the inmates, Jerry Bradway, quails as he listens to them riff and thinks to himself, ''The old life rewrites itself every minute.'' ''The free future is hard to imagine,'' he frets. ''I have trouble enough tracing the shape of the knowable past.'' Jerry, imprisoned for unspecified white-collar crimes, happens to be the father of the preteen anchors. He suspects his wife, from whom he is legally separated, of writing their scripts. Unperturbed by what they don't know, the girls rattle on gaily: ''The fear continues to grow.'' ''Even the numbers are panicking.'' ''What is a credit default swap?'' they ask. ''What is a sovereign default? What is a special-purpose entity?'' ''We don't know. Do you know? Do you care?'' ''What is Wall Street?'' ''Who is Wall Street?'' The inmates laugh nervously.
DeLillo has always been a master transmitter of American zeitgeist anxiety, even in times when there was less to be anxious about. Four years ago, his post-9/11 novel ''Falling Man'' evoked the ''puppetry of human desperation.'' The title refers to a fictional performance artist who distresses Manhattanites in the weeks after the World Trade Center's collapse by appearing ''unannounced, in various parts of the city, suspended from one or another structure, always upside down, wearing a suit, a tie and dress shoes. . . . There were people shouting up at him, outraged at the spectacle.'' But as long ago as 1985, toward the end of the cold war, in the (retrospectively) halcyon period of the Reagan years, DeLillo's satirical novel ''White Noise'' portrayed a paranoid family fleeing a toxic industrial cloud, dazed by technological and media overload, speculating wrongly about their situation. ''The family is the cradle of the world's misinformation,'' he wrote then.
Twenty-six years on, that cradle broadcasts from the news desk on Jerry's prison TV. He tells his bunkmate (and fellow stock watcher), Norman Bloch, an art-collecting tax cheat, that he's sure his wife is ''masterminding the whole thing.'' ''What's she like,'' Norman asks, irrelevantly. ''Sneaky sort of pretty,'' Jerry replies. ''You have to pay attention to see it.'' DeLillo knows that however amorphous and external a source of grievance may be, the aggrieved seek a name on which to pin blame, as if any one person or proximate cause could explain a global crisis. Like the children in ''Falling Man'' who search the skies with binoculars for ''Bill Lawton'' -- their mishearing of Bin Laden -- the fearful seek a known adversary, even if their knowledge is faulty and the chance of retribution highly improbable.
Each of the stories collected in ''The Angel Esmeralda'' addresses a different kind of unease. It's almost a pity that the reader knows from the start that they were written over five decades -- because each one feels like a coded contemporary allegory. DeLillo's doomy brainteasing reveals the enduring adaptability of human insecurities. In the first story, ''Creation,'' published in 1979, he explores the powerlessness a man must accept when he and his wife are trapped, ''No Exit'' style, on a tropical island whose only airport's flights are overbooked, day after day after day. ''Boredom and fear are one and the same to me,'' his wife says. She's convinced they'll get back to New York, but this conviction won't get them two seats on a plane home.
In ''Human Moments in World War III,'' which first appeared in 1983, a bomber pilot in a surveillance spacecraft ''floating over the continents'' must fire at distant targets, which may or may not be human, in a war-ravaged America. He tells himself ''it is only scenery'' and wants to say, ''Forget the measure of our vision, the sweep of things, the war itself, the terrible death. Forget the overarching night, the stars as static points, as mathematical fields. Forget the cosmic solitude, the upwelling awe and dread.'' Yet he can't overcome his ''primitive fear of the weapons we are advanced enough to design and produce.'' In a decade of airport scares and unmanned drone attacks, DeLillo's calmly delivered meditations assume a hauntingly Cassandran tone.
On the whole, though, these short stories (''Hammer and Sickle,'' at 34 pages, is the longest) serve as oddly liberating reminders that terror existed before there was a war on it; that human frailty is not a phase, is not avoidable, is not exceptional. In the 1988 story ''The Ivory Acrobat,'' an American expatriate in Greece who has been trying to lead an ''unpremeditated'' life as ''a foreigner anonymous -- soft-footed, self-informed, content to occupy herself in random observation'' learns the limits of her detachment when an earthquake shakes Athens. ''The Runner,'' also from 1988, features a woman who tries to impose logic on chance after she witnesses a kidnapping. She refuses to believe that the snatcher is a stranger, ''someone lurching out of nowhere, out of dreaming space'' -- as if an act of violence had to have a logical rationale.
Another form of delusional belief shapes the title story, published in 1994, in which nuns and passers-by in the South Bronx seek holy significance in the meaningless murder of a homeless girl. The later stories play with more subliminal motivations: a visitor to an art gallery who romanticizes the crimes of Red Army Faction terrorists is panicked by a museumgoer who invades her personal space; two insecure college boys spar intellectually, but are cowed by their charismatic professor; while in the final story, ''The Starveling,'' a reclusive film addict loses touch not only with other people's reality but with his own.
DeLillo packs fertile ruminations and potent consolation into each of these rich, dense, concentrated stories. Like the rootless female expat in Athens in ''The Ivory Acrobat,'' he turns fear into strength by confronting it, converting it into a kind of protective amulet: ''She wanted to hear someone say this very thing . . . that they were all unprotected in the drive of time.'' Here and throughout ''The Angel Esmeralda,'' DeLillo finds justice, even a kind of catharsis, in the idea that fate doesn't play favorites forever, or for long.

HEADLINE: A Drag Performer's Loving Family

 BODY:
In ''The Boy Who Became Judy Garland,'' on the cover of Metropolitan last week, Dan Barry profiled Tommy Femia, 52, who had a tough time coming out as gay when he was a teenager but is now cheered by his family during his drag performances. Readers wrote to NYTimes.com to applaud his story, his parents and his act; below is a sampling of their responses. They also discussed Ginia Bellafante's Big City column criticizing tax breaks for the film and television industries at a time when schools are experiencing spending cuts.
Our world would be a better place if all families shared this kind of love and support and acceptance of diversity. What a beautiful story. I wish the Femia family many more years of success and happiness.Maxim 
Washington DC
The Femia family is a wonderful and talented bunch, but my hat is off to Mama Femia who made her own, more difficult transformation, and came to realize that love can see beyond stereotypes and bigotry to allow people to be who and what they are. Thank you for bringing us this delightful story. ... Judy lives again.Forsythia715
Hillsborough, NC
Twenty years ago, right after I moved to NYC at the age of 24, my first boyfriend took me to see Tommy Femia. As you can imagine, coming from the suburbs I had never seen a performance like this before. At the time, I was not out to my family nor anyone for that matter. Tommy's performance became a reassuring moment in my own coming out story and development as a gay man.Chuck

The Filmmakers' Break
My classroom and school have definitely suffered from the educational cuts of the past three years. But it's not the film subsidies -- which support job creation for thousands of middle-class creative professionals -- that are to blame. Rather, it is the continued corporate welfare and economic coddling that pours down on the 1 percent -- the investment bankers and corporate raiders -- that find my classroom facing yet another round of cuts.Bronxteacher
NY, NY
I have a child attending city schools, but I strongly disagree with the tone of this piece. The film and television shows that are filming here are some of the only sources of jobs for the hundreds of costume, wardrobe and set-building specialists who work in the city. Please don't lobby for the city to drive away precious jobs.Ejpolk
Queens
As one of the army of thousands in this town who make a decent living as below-the-line craftspeople for the industry, I often find myself thankful for the tax credit. Next time you go to a movie shot in NY, have the patience to sit through the credits and take note of the hundreds of names that go by -- all hard-working, taxpaying New Yorkers with disposable income to invest back into our neighborhoods. That's hundreds working on that one movie.
I'm not one who believes in unjustified tax breaks, but from my perspective, this program successfully creates thousands of good, middle-class jobs for New Yorkers.Jen

Silly New York City residents. They should know by now that New York City is not and will not be for supporting comprehensive public education for children. This is now a city for the pretty people, the powerful people and the wealthy people. Stop giving birth to babies.DMH

HEADLINE: Towers, a Tunnel, Noise, Lessons and a Library

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
''WHEN it comes to buildings, size matters -- more so today than ever before,'' Kate Ascher writes in ''The Heights: Anatomy of a Skyscraper'' (Penguin Press). In this lushly illustrated book, Ms. Ascher meticulously and lucidly deconstructs the design of manmade towers from the foundation on up to the imperatives of physical and psychological security in a terror-conscious society.
She traces their roots from monuments to secular and religious icons (the Pyramids and Europe's Gothic cathedrals) to the first habitable skyscrapers in downtown New York and Chicago, whose construction, in the 1880s, was facilitated by the mass production of structural steel and by improved elevator technology. By 1913, New York had about 1,000 buildings higher than the 130-foot height limit imposed in Chicago. ''New York was competing against only itself in the race for height,'' Ms. Ascher writes. 
Before 2000, fewer than 250 buildings around the world were taller than 600 feet. Since then, the number has more than doubled. Ms. Ascher, who teaches at Columbia University and manages Happold Consulting's United States practice, writes that modern skyscrapers are, in effect, small cities and are likely to proliferate around the world as the economy revives and more and more people congregate in urban areas.
They will become taller -- several mile-high self-contained towers are on the drawing boards -- greener, distinguished by radical shapes and occupied by a more diverse roster of tenants, she predicts.
When the Holland Tunnel opened in 1927, it was the world's longest and largest vehicular tunnel and was distinguished by an innovative ventilation system. Until then, vehicles were ferried across the Hudson and were subject to the vicissitudes of ice and fog. In ''Highway Under the Hudson: A History of the Holland Tunnel'' (NYU Press), Robert W. Jackson explores the tortured bistate bureaucratic and political prelude to the construction of the 1.6-mile underwater corridor, which, by the way, was named not for the region's Dutch roots, but for the project's first chief engineer, Clifford Holland of Brooklyn, who died at 41 of heart failure in a sanitarium while undergoing a tonsillectomy.
''Why Noise Matters: A Worldwide Perspective on the Problems, Policies and Solutions'' (Routledge), by John Stewart with Arline L. Bronzaft, Francis McManus, Nigel Rodgers and Val Weedon, is not exclusively about New York. But given that New Yorkers complain about noise more than anything else (250,000 calls to 311 last year), this book is right up their alley. Noise matters, the book argues, because it affects people's physical and mental health. The book explores how legislation, including New York's amended 2007 noise code, has helped modulate the full-throated voice of the city.
New York is ''one of the most sustainable and sustainability-minded metropolises,'' writes Steven Cohen, executive director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University -- which is why he makes the city's experiences a case study in his ''Sustainability Management: Lessons From and for New York City, America, and the Planet.'' Among other things, he proposes local waste-to-energy and anaerobic digesters (automated compost piles), urban gardens, congestion pricing for cars and trucks to generate subsidies for mass transit, and care for a water supply system that he pronounces ''a good news story that will only stay good if we pay attention and protect it from harm.''
''The Library of Philip Johnson: Selections From the Glass House'' (Birch Books Conservation), by Birch Cooper and Jordan Hruska, provides a romp though the architect's favorite, and often New York-centric, books. In his introduction, Robert A. M. Stern writes that Johnson would have loved ''the celebration of scholarly inquiry and personal taste and of books as objects of virtue -- ideas furnishing a room and a talent.''
What will readers in the electronic future have to compare with Johnson's study and its library, he asks. ''Shelves lined with Kindles?''

HEADLINE: Inheriting a Loan

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
THE death of a family member may bring a barrage of sadness, a bequest of property -- and a mortgage to repay.
''It's like getting a gift with a string,'' said Judith D. Grimaldi, a principal of Grimaldi & Yeung, an estate planning law firm in Brooklyn. Thirty-one percent of people 65 and older, in fact, have home mortgages, according to the Census Bureau.
''Most of my clients just end up selling the house,'' Ms. Grimaldi said, ''taking the proceeds and saying, 'Thank you, Mom.' '' 
But if the beneficiary wants to keep the home, just who is responsible for paying the mortgage until the estate is settled can fall into something of a ''gray area,'' said Deirdre R. Wheatley-Liss, a tax lawyer at Fein, Such, Kahn & Shepard in Parsippany, N.J.
Under federal law, the mortgage must be allowed to remain in effect without changes when it passes from one person to another because of a death. This negates any due-on-sale clause in the mortgage.
Who pays generally depends on the deceased relative's will, and also who among the survivors has the ability to maintain the mortgage, the experts say.
The will might stipulate, for example, that the heir receive the home, free and clear, Ms. Wheatley-Liss said, which may mean that the executor will be directed to sell stocks, bonds or other assets in the estate to pay off the mortgage. (If there is no will, state law will come into play.)
The survivors, meanwhile, should look at the inheritance of property from a practical, economic perspective. ''You need to look very strongly at whether you can afford to maintain the mortgage and maintain the property,'' Ms. Wheatley-Liss said.
Although there may be some emotional attachment to the home, having it appraised can help determine whether it's worth keeping. ''The question would always be: 'Are you protecting equity?' '' said Michael McHugh, the president and chief executive of Continental Home Loans in Melville, N.Y.
An estate lawyer or financial adviser can provide advice on estate taxes and other expenses associated with the property.
The survivors should contact the lender early on to let it know that the borrower has died and that they are the heirs, or the executor of the estate, and to determine the loan's status. Mr. McHugh suggests sending the lender a copy of the death certificate and a letter from the estate's lawyer.
It is also important to determine whether the deceased relative has stayed current on the property taxes, if they are not paid through the lender.
But what if the mortgage is delinquent -- overlooked in a final illness? If the payments are behind by 60 days or so, it is possible to catch up. If it's 90 or more days late, the property may already be in foreclosure proceedings, Mr. McHugh said. Depending on state laws and lender practices, the lender could either demand full payment of all the back payments, or continue with the foreclosure.
Some family members ask about whether they can ''walk away'' from the property if it is underwater, or worth less than the mortgage balance, Ms. Grimaldi said, noting that such requests are more common in this shaky economy. They can do this and allow the foreclosure to show up as the estate's responsibility and record, she said. But care is needed if the estate has other assets, like a second home or an investment portfolio, which the lender could come after to satisfy the debt.
In some cases, negotiating with the lender for a short sale on the property may be the best solution. In a short sale, the lender agrees to accept less than what is owed on the mortgage.
If the deceased relative had a reverse mortgage on the property -- one that paid him or her a stipend and accrued a balance -- the heirs could pay off the mortgage balance in full; sell the property and pay off any balance with the proceeds; or refinance.

THE BIG PROFILE
By Dave Itzkoff
When you've got a foundation-rattling voice like John Goodman's, the last thing you want is a role that robs you of it, right? Wrong. In ''The Artist,'' a tribute to the silent films of yesteryear, Goodman plays a Hollywood studio mogul while relying on his surprisingly expressive face. ''I'd like it to be less expressive,'' Goodman confessed. ''Maybe I'll get a series of those Botox shots I've been waiting for. With a turkey baster.'' That, he said, would go nicely with the Crisco he used to slick back his hair, ''especially when you stick your hand on a hot skillet.''
VALUING 'HAROLD & KUMAR'
By Jacob Goldstein 
Why is a ticket to a packed showing of ''Puss in Boots'' the same price as one to an empty showing of ''Anonymous''? Weird pricing behavior like this drives economists nuts. Liran Einav of Stanford co-wrote a paper on it, and he says, ''I'm not sure we nailed an answer.'' Einav's best guess: Theater executives are too nervous. ''They don't know how many people would see crappy movies if they dropped the price to three bucks,'' he said. I asked Ryan Noonan, a spokesman for AMC Theaters. ''It's a great question,'' he said.
LATE NIGHT WITH THE REPUBLICANS
By Matt Bai
The G.O.P. contest is like a late-night talk show. Everyone gets a moment on the couch, awash in hoots and klieg lights, before making room for someone else. (Newt Gingrich may be next up.) It may reflect how eager G.O.P. voters are for a more inspiring choice than Mitt Romney. He hangs around at the end of the couch like an Andy Richter, only less funny.
SO LONG, BOZO
By Eric Spitznagel Dottie Lux, a professional clown who performs in San Francisco, says people often come up to her and say, ''I've always been afraid of clowns, but I love you.'' Lux's act calls for her to take off her clothes. She's part of a growing nightclub subculture called Clown Burlesque, emerging in cities like London and Detroit, that thrills audiences with suggestive clown dances and strategically placed pink-balloon pasties. Some clowns worry about long-term consequences. David Magidson, who has toured with Ringling Brothers Circus, says a 6-year-old's accidental exposure to a near-naked clown with balloon breasts could result in ''kids having to see therapists for the rest of their lives.''
SHOP TALK
By Tom Vanderbilt
''Pocket anomaly!'' The words came my way in an airport full-body scanner; the object in question was a loose cough drop. The phrase -- both specific and abstract -- is the essence of bureaucratic language: a performative code that unifies its users and slyly evades its audience. It is a social good in the sense that it makes processes efficient and connotes expertise. But left unchecked, it needlessly enlarges authority and corrodes meaning. (In Mike Judge's futuristic ''Idiocracy,'' the only words the police don't mangle are ''particular individual.'') Like English translated into Spanish, bureaucratic language bulks up verbiage by some 20 percent: ''to speed boarding'' becomes ''to expedite the boarding process.'' It's a tongue no one bothers to translate. VERY SHORT REVIEWS

O CANADIAN FASHION!

Joe Fresh -- a ''clean and modern'' Canadian clothing brand, says its owner and namesake Joe Mimran, that makes items like the ''landscape sweater'' (above) -- opened two pop-up stores in Manhattan. So what is Canadian fashion? It's ''100 percent'' different from U.S. fashion, said Robin Kay, president of the Fashion Design Council of Canada. ''We're brand-shy.''
THE VIRAL TAXIDERMIST
By Gaby Dunn
The taxidermist Chuck Testa is so good at his craft that customers often mistake his dead animals for the living -- until he corrects them: ''Nope! Chuck Testa!'' Or at least that's the conceit of the low-budget commercial that went viral this summer. It has amassed more than a million hits on YouTube. ''I got a tweet from [the reality star] Kat Von D last week,'' Testa, 55, said. ''But most all the gratitude is from young, regular people.''
DUST BOWL, THE SEQUEL
By Maud Newton
Similarities between our time and the Depression era are extending beyond the fiscal crisis. A blinding sandstorm rolled into Lubbock, Tex., last month, reminding old-timers of the Dust Bowl and leading a councilman to invoke ''The Grapes of Wrath.'' As climate change threatens to leave the Southwest parched, it's sobering to look back. In Woody Guthrie's ''Talking Dust Bowl Blues,'' a displaced, hungry family scrounges up '''tater stew'' so thin ''you could read a magazine right through it.''

HEADLINE: From the Mouths Of Executives, Little Comfort

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
EIGHT times a year, legions of policy wonks, bankers and traders devour a Federal Reserve survey of the American economy known simply as ''the beige book.''
In recent years, the document has been an appropriately gloomy chronicle of economic distress, but it is enlivened by choice anecdotes. The current version, published in October, for example, says that in the Fed's Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia and Dallas districts, demand for used cars has created shortages, while in the Minneapolis and Chicago regions, shoppers have been ''trading down to value products at grocery stores.'' Wages have been stagnant over all, but in Atlanta and San Francisco, there are bidding wars for information technology specialists, and in Cleveland, pay is rising for truck drivers.
If only because it moves the markets, the Fed's beige book is worth perusing. But as I discovered last week, another beige book produced by a formidable organization -- Goldman Sachs -- is more useful in assessing the outlook of corporate America. 
This second version, called the ''United States S.& P. 500 Beige Book,'' is compiled quarterly by Goldman for clients, not the general public. Unlike the Fed's summary, which relies on a variety of sources, the Goldman version emphasizes a series of pithy statements made by senior executives during earnings conference calls, and the current selection makes for disturbing reading.
Corporate America continues to churn out impressive profits. But the report shows that economic uncertainty -- much of it generated in European capitals and in Congress -- is impeding spending and investing. This helps explain why Goldman is projecting relatively little growth for the economy or the stock market through 2012.
Consider this statement from Stacy J. Smith, chief financial officer of Intel: ''While business levels remain strong, the uncertainty around 2012 G.D.P. growth rates has caused us to slow hiring for the rest of this year.''
Or this one by Jim Skinner, the chief executive of McDonald's: ''The economists say we're officially out of the recession, but it hardly feels that way,'' he said, adding, ''Consumers everywhere continue to be cautious and hesitant to spend.''
Or this one, by Salvatore Iannuzzi, C.E.O. of Monster Worldwide: ''We are not giving guidance, certainly at this point, with regard to 2012 for the simple fact it's just too difficult to predict. We do not have a basis at this point. Faced with this heightened lack of confidence, firms around the world are scaling back their hiring plans and more carefully controlling their spending.''
Taken individually, such comments may seem idiosyncratic. Displayed together, a pattern emerges. The Goldman beige book is ''a grand mosaic'' assembled from executives' comments about prospects for their enterprises and for the larger economy, says David J. Kostin, Goldman's chief United States investment strategist, who heads the team that creates the report. ''This is not my voice,'' he says. ''It's what seasoned business executives are saying.''
Three striking themes arise from the latest round of earnings calls. First, he says, is the unusually high degree of uncertainty. ''A lot of it is coming from the crisis in Europe and from the budget impasse in the United States and from all of the unresolved macroeconomic problems out there,'' he says.
What is the effect? ''The uncertainty is what is driving the decisions of corporate America not to pursue certain business opportunities, to maintain flexibility on the balance sheet in case there are more problems ahead.''
For example, Laurence D. Fink, C.E.O. of BlackRock, says: ''Politics and government are playing a major role in market performance and market volatility.'' He adds: ''This is a confidence crisis, not a liquidity crisis. There's trillions and trillions of dollars sitting on the sideline.''
In a similar vein, David Simon, the chief executive of the Simon Property Group, says, ''The biggest caveat that we have is all about the macro. Where is the economy? Where is consumer confidence? The election year throws a whole set of psychological issues at the consumer, none of which are positive.''
Mr. Kostin says that executives and investors are ''obsessed'' with the question that is a second theme of the report: In a weak economy and with rising commodity costs, can companies maintain their profit margins? An affirmative answer is needed to sustain the healthy earnings that have propped up prices in the stock market -- but there is no real clarity across corporate America.
Indra K. Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo, for example, says her company has raised prices successfully -- so far. ''I think the level of pricing we're taking in the marketplace puts us in uncharted territory,'' she says. ''We haven't had this amount of pricing in a long time.''
Coca-Cola's chief financial officer, Gary P. Fayard, says it has raised prices and accelerated ''cost-saving initiatives.'' McDonald's is not certain that it will be able to charge its customers more. ''As we consider future price increases, we remain mindful of the extreme economic uncertainty, cautious consumer sentiment amidst the austerity measures and shrinking disposable income,'' Peter J. Bensen, its chief financial officer, says.
THESE constraints, along with the uncertain domestic outlook, add up to a third theme: that American corporations are often relying on emerging markets for growth.
Coca-Cola's sales rose 19 percent in India in the third quarter, for example, and 11 percent in China. For Coach, the luxury retailer, international sales are at least as important. ''As we develop scale particularly in China and East Asia, we expect that 50 percent of our growth over the next five years will be outside of North America,'' says Lew Frankfort, its chief executive.
Even Apple, which has kept profit margins high while gaining sales, is finding an increasing share of its business abroad. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's C.E.O, says that in the last fiscal year, sales in the China region surpassed 12 percent of the company's total, from just 2 percent two years ago. ''It has quickly become No. 2 on our list of top revenue countries very, very quickly,'' he says. ''And we're obviously placing additional investment.''
Apple stock has risen sharply, and shareholders have little to complain about. Still, Apple has built an enormous cache of capital that isn't being used for operations. Peter Oppenheimer, its C.F.O., says that of its ''little over $81 billion of cash'' at the end of the quarter, ''a bit more than $54 billion or two-thirds of it was offshore.''
That may be fine for Apple. But is holding an offshore stash that big good for the American economy? No matter. In a year of uncertainty, many companies are hedging their bets.

HEADLINE: Situation Normal All Fracked Up

BYLINE: By ELIZA GRISWOLD

 BODY:
Amwell Township is a 44-square-mile plot of steep ravines and grassy pasturelands planted with alfalfa, trefoil and timothy in the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania. It's home to some 4,000 people, most of whom live in villages named Amity, Lone Pine and Prosperity.
From some views, this diamond-shaped cut of land looks like the hardscrabble farmland it has been since the 18th century, when English and Scottish settlers successfully drove away the members of a Native American village. Arrowheads still line the streambeds. Hickory trees march out along its high, dry ridges. Box elders ring the lower, wetter gullies. The air smells of sweet grass. Cows moo. Horses whinny.
From other vantages, it looks like an American natural-gas field, home to 10 gas wells, a compressor station -- which feeds fresh gas into pipelines leading to homes hundreds of miles away -- and what was, until late this summer, an open five-acre water-impoundment chemical pond. Trucks rev engines over fresh earth. Backhoes grind stubborn stones. Pipeline snakes beneath clear-cut hillsides. 
The township sits atop the Marcellus Shale Deposit, one of the largest fields of natural gas in the world, a formation that stretches beneath 575 miles of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York. Shale gas, even its fiercest critics concede, presents an opportunity for the United States to be less dependent on foreign oil. According to Wood Mackenzie, an energy-consulting firm, the Marcellus formation will supply 6 percent of America's gas this year, a figure expected to more than double by 2020.
About five years ago, leases began to appear in the mailboxes of residents of Amwell Township from Range Resources, a Texas-based oil company seeking to harvest gas through hydraulic fracturing. ''Fracking,'' as it is known, is a process of natural-gas drilling that involves pumping vast quantities of water, sand and chemicals thousands of feet into the earth to crack the deep shale deposits and free bubbles of gas from the ancient, porous rock. Harvesting this gas promises either to provide Americans with a clean domestic energy source or to despoil rural areas and poison our air and drinking water, depending on whom you ask.
On Nov. 21, the Delaware River Basin Commission, which involves four states -- Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware -- will vote on rules governing fracking in the river's watershed, which supplies some 15 million people with drinking water. The states most affected will be New York and Pennsylvania, which sit on the Marcellus Shale, where the gas is closest to the surface.
This summer, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York moved to lift the state's yearlong moratorium on fracking against vocal opposition from environmentalists and many local residents. Following a series of hearings this month, New York will decide whether to allow fracking early next year. In the meantime, New Yorkers are looking to Pennsylvania, the first neighbor to welcome fracking, as a model.
There are more than 4,000 Marcellus wells in Pennsylvania, with projections ranging from 2,500 new wells a year to a total of more than 100,000 over the next few decades; 458 of those wells are in Washington County and 60 are in Amwell Township, to which fracking has given an injection of new income and business; it has also spurred one of the first E.P.A. investigations into fracking's effects on rivers, streams, drinking water and human health.
Just before Christmas in 2008, a handful of neighbors granted Range Resources the right to drill thousands of feet below their homes and up to two miles in any direction. Signing leases here is nothing new. For the past 200 years, one industry after another has extracted minerals from the land. In the 1800s, it was coal; in the 1900s it was glass, coke and steel and industrial mining. ''Sooner or later, somebody wants to go around, under or through you,'' one farmer and gun-shop proprietor told me. ''You make your best deal and you talk to a lawyer. At least these companies pay something up front.''
What these companies paid was more than many people in Amwell Township, where the per capita income in the 2000 census was $18,285, were accustomed to seeing in their lifetimes, even if the windfall wasn't the same for everyone. Next-door neighbors made, upon signing, between $1,500 and more than $500,000 for the same amount of land. Curiously enough, the huge gap in payments didn't cause much trouble among neighbors, at least at first. Most, if they express a political viewpoint at all, are old-school libertarians who believe each man has the right to live by his will and abilities.
The conflict instead is between ''country folk and city people,'' Bill Hartley, 63, a barber and a cattle farmer told me. ''The country folk want the drilling and have mineral rights. The city folk don't want the drilling and have no rights to sell.''
At Hartley's Styling Shop, the barbershop Hartley has run out of a rented trailer on his great-great-grandfather's farm for the past 16 years, the gas boom is all anyone talks about. There's a barber pole spinning outside and a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. A John Deere clock tells time according to a tractor. When I met Hartley there early last spring, he was alone, reclining in his barber's chair and chain-smoking, as he had been for hours, or maybe years. The trailer's air and Naugahyde chairs were saturated with stale smoke.
''Do you mind if I smoke?'' he asked. I didn't. ''Good, because I would have told you, 'Tough.' '' Hartley, who has the long, hollow face of an Appalachian Marlboro Man, keeps 35 cows on 110 acres of rocky fields of fescue. Until recently, like most farmers he knows, he needed a second job to pay for the cows. Raising cows costs more than $300 a head per year. It takes a good year for Hartley to break even. Now he has more money than he ever imagined. Signing his gas lease at ''a little more'' than $1,000 an acre netted him in excess of $110,000 upon signing, plus 12.5 percent of the royalties from gas produced on his land. Hartley prefers not to discuss exact amounts. ''That's nobody's business,'' he said. But after the first couple of years, production tends to drop off precipitously, and the royalty checks will dwindle. So Hartley still cuts hair. ''And I like people,'' he said.
As Hartley sees it, the gas industry has helped him to preserve his farm, cows and way of life. ''I don't want to say you have to be born into it,'' he said. ''But it has to be in your blood.''
The Marcellus boom has brought a host of economic benefits to Western Pennsylvania -- new jobs, booked motel rooms, busy food franchises and newly paved roads -- and promises to bring more. According to a recent study by Pennsylvania State University, the industry has created 23,000 jobs, including employment for roustabouts, construction workers, helicopter pilots, sign makers, Laundromat workers, electricians, caterers, chambermaids, office workers, water haulers and land surveyors. Not to mention that leaseholders are saving, on average, 55 percent of the money they make upon signing leases and 66 percent of their royalties, according to the Pennsylvania State University study.
Hartley's cousin Stacey Haney lives two and a half miles from Hartley's farm. A brown-haired, blue-eyed former beautician, Haney, 42, is a nurse at the nearby Washington Hospital. Hartley and Haney share a kind of tough self-reliance, as well as a quick, dark wit.
''We came into this world poor, and we'll go out of this world poor,'' Haney says. This is her family's motto. Haney -- a single mother who wears her hair in a shag -- works full time and is raising her two children, Paige, 12, and Harley, 15, along with an ark of 4-H animals. Her father, Larry, whom everyone calls Pappy, is a steelworker. He has had long stints of unemployment, beginning when Stacey was in second grade. He's also a sometime farmer whose butternuts have won first place so often at the Washington County Fair that no one else bothers to enter anymore. The fair is the highlight of the Haneys' year: beribboned photos of their award-winning rabbits, goats and pigs line the walls of their immaculate three-bedroom home, which Haney has hand-stenciled with deer tracks.
When the natural-gas industry came to town, Haney saw an opportunity to pay off farm bills and make a profit from the land. Word had it that the companies were interested in signing up large parcels, so in the winter of 2008, Haney, who owned only eight acres, persuaded two of her neighbors to pool their land on a lease for which she was paid, in installments, $1,000 dollars per acre and 15 percent royalties.
The money would help to pay the taxes on their farms. The land man who came to the Haney home to sell the lease showed pictures of a farm and pasture with a well cap ''the size of a garbage can,'' Haney said, which she found reassuring. And it didn't seem as if the drilling would affect their lives much. Range Resources was involved in the community in small ways too. For the past several years, it operated a booth at the Washington County Fair. In 2010, the company offered kids an extra $100 for the farm animals they auctioned. That was the year Stacey Haney's son, Harley, took his breeding goat, Boots, all the way to grand champion.
At the fair, Haney ran into her next-door neighbor, Beth Voyles, 54, a horse trainer and dog breeder, who signed the lease with Haney in 2008. She told Haney that her 11 /2-year-old boxer, Cummins, had just died. Voyles thought that he was poisoned. She saw the dog drinking repeatedly from a puddle of road runoff, and she thought that the water the gas company used to wet down the roads probably had antifreeze in it. ''We do not use ethylene glycol in the fracking process,'' Matt Pitzarella of Range Resources told me. He also said that the dog's veterinarian couldn't confirm the dog had been poisoned and that another possible cause of death was cancer.
A month later, Haney's dog, Hunter, also died suddenly. Soon after, Voyles called Haney to tell her that her barrel horse, Jody, was dead. Lab results revealed a high level of toxicity in her liver. Voyles sent her animals' test results to Range Resources. In response, Range Resources wrote to Voyles to say that, as the veterinarian indicated, the horse died of toxicity of the liver, not antifreeze poisoning. The company did acknowledge that the vet suspected the horse died of poisoning by heavy metals. Subsequent tests of the Voyleses' water supply by Range Resources revealed no heavy metals.
Voyles's boxers began to abort litters of puppies; six were born with cleft palates. They died within hours. Others were born dead or without legs or hair. Unsure what to do, Voyles stored 15 of the puppies in her freezer. (Range Resources says it was never notified about the puppies.) By December, Boots, the grand-champion goat, aborted two babies. Haney had to put her down the day after Christmas.
What was going on with the animals? Where were the toxic chemicals in their blood coming from? Haney feared that the arrival of the gas industry and the drilling that had begun less than 1,000 feet from her home might have something to do with it.
In Amwell Township, your opinion of fracking tends to correspond with how much money you're making and with how close you live to the gas wells, chemical ponds, pipelines and compressor stations springing up in the area. Many of those who live nearby fear that a leak in the plastic liner of a chemical pond could drip into a watershed or that a truck spill could send carcinogens into a field of beef cattle. (According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 65 Marcellus wells drilled this year have been cited for faulty cement casings, which could result in leaks.) But for many other residents, including Haney's neighbors, the risks seem small, and the benefits -- clean fuel, economic development -- far outweigh them.
On a Saturday morning in July 2011, Bill Hartley's Styling Shop bustled with clients -- a truck driver, a leaseholder, a landowner -- all of whom profited from the gas boom. One was Ray Day, 64, a ginger-haired farmer, who, along with his brothers and sisters, owns nearly 300 acres of Amwell Township. Thanks to the money he received from allowing Range Resources to drill, build a compressor station and dig a chemical pond on his land, he has been able to reroof two barns, buy a new hay baler and construct an addition to his house for his 94-year-old mother. ''I only buy something if I can pay cash,'' Day said later. And he still has plenty of money left over. Was he planning a vacation, maybe to Florida? Day snorted good-naturedly. ''Farmers don't go to Florida,'' he said.
A few days later, I met up with Day off 1-79 at the Amity-Lone Pine exit, a little more than a mile from Stacey Haney's home, and followed him past the local elementary school to a barn, with a white wooden sign that said Day Farm 1912. We drove a few thousand yards up a steep hill to a gated compound, where we were met by a young woman who'd come from West Virginia, along with her husband, a driller, to work as a security guard for Range Resources. She called headquarters to confirm my permission to visit. As we waited, Day pointed out a 40-by-100 fabric hoop structure where he stores round bales of hay. During the hydraulic fracturing, which took place 24 hours a day in March and April 2010, the huge open shed served as a parking area and meeting place.
Day pointed to where there had been a truck spill of chemically treated water used in fracking, and then he pointed to the stream below, which flows into the watershed at Ten-Mile Creek and then onto the Monongahela River. The spill hadn't reached the stream, he said. Moreover, he'd been impressed with Range Resource's openness about what happened. Every hour while fracking, workers walked the temporary plastic pipeline, full of chemical water, that ran between his site and the pond near Stacey Haney's home. While walking the line, workers discovered several cracks that spilled frack water on the frozen ground. Such cracks are not unusual. ''We all know they leak,'' one Range employee wrote in an internal e-mail, which has become a matter of public record pending a lawsuit.
''None of it leaked on my property,'' Day said later. Finally, the guard let us go up and take a look at the 3.5-acre chemical impoundment, known as a frack pond, which was 20 feet deep. The used frack water, called flowback, was milky gray. The aerators hummed. The impoundment, like many nearby, sat at the top of a watershed. We'd only been at the pond for a couple of minutes before a sedan raced up the hill behind us. My access had been denied. Later, Matt Pitzarella, a spokesman for Range Resources, said that OSHA regulations regarding equipment and the company's own safety standards required that all visitors wear protective gear.
Day drove me next to the well pad, a football field of cement and a few condensate tanks that painters were rendering forest green. Long before the recent drillers came, this was named the Well Field, after an oil well locals said was drilled here in the 1920s. Like some of his neighbors, Day signed a gas lease in part to protect his land from what he saw as a far more rapacious industry headed his way: long-wall coal mining, a process that takes a ribbon of coal out of a seam over miles. ''Long-wall mining is so much more destructive than this, the way I see it,'' he said. ''Hopefully with these pipes they wouldn't want to mine coal underneath us.''
The fracturing was now over, the major pieces of equipment were gone and the field was replanted with medium red clover. Day wasn't concerned about the impact of drilling. ''Nothing I've seen would indicate an adverse effect,'' he said, ''except the odor coming off the compressor station.'' (Range Resources/ told Day that the smell comes from anaerobic bacteria that are more prevalent in this fracking process but that they are harmless. Investigating air quality around compressor stations is part of the E.P.A.'s ongoing study.) Day, like most of his neighbors, trusted the companies to use best practices. A man's word means a lot here. After all, without regulation or oversight, he and other farmers worked together to do things like fence streams to keep cattle out of them.
We drove back through an alfalfa field to the farm. ''You haven't asked me what my profession is,'' Day said. I'd assumed he was a farmer. ''No one here could survive on farming,'' he replied. ''I taught science in local schools for 35 years.''
For Day and others, allowing the gas company to drill on their land isn't simply a matter of cash. They also firmly believe that natural gas should be used as a bridge between foreign oil and sustainable energy sources, like solar and wind. ''Natural gas is the most eco-friendly fuel source that we have,'' said Rick Baker, 59, a piano tuner who lives on 91 acres located between Bill Hartley and Stacey Haney. ''Some people will argue with me on this, but it burns clean.'' He's such a proponent of drilling that he even agreed to star in a commercial for Range Resources, for which he was paid $200.
About a year before Haney's dog died, in the summer of 2009, she began to notice that sometimes her water was black and that it seemed to be eating away at her faucets, washing machine, hot-water heater and dishwasher. When she took a shower, the smell was terrible -- like rotten eggs and diarrhea. Haney started buying bottled water for drinking and cooking, but she couldn't afford to do the same for her animals.
Later that summer, her son, Harley, was stricken with mysterious stomach pains and periods of extreme fatigue, which sent him to the emergency room and to Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital a half-dozen times. ''He couldn't lift his head out of my lap,'' Haney said. Early in November of the following year, after the animals died, Haney decided to have Harley tested for heavy metals and ethylene glycol. While she waited for the results, Haney called Range Resources and asked that it supply her with drinking water. The company tested her water and found nothing wrong with it. Haney's father began to haul water to her barn.
A week later, on Haney's 41st birthday, Harley's test results came back. Harley had elevated levels of arsenic. Haney called Range Resources again. The company delivered a 5,100-gallon tank of drinking water, called a water buffalo, the next day. ''Our policy is if you have a complaint or a concern, we'll supply you with a water source within 24 hours,'' Pitzarella of Range Resources said. He added that the company has ''never seen any evidence that anyone in that household has arsenic issues.''
Although she was able to work 40 hours as a nurse and care for two kids and a small farm, Haney wasn't feeling great, either. So a few months later, she had herself and Paige tested too. Their tests results showed they had small amounts of heavy metals like arsenic and industrial solvents like benzene and toluene in their blood. Dr. Philip Landrigan of Mount Sinai said that the results show evidence of exposure, but that it was difficult to determine potential health effects at the levels found. But he added: ''These people are exposed to arsenic and benzene, known human carcinogens. There's considered to be no safe levels of these chemicals.'' Pitzarella says that Range Resources was never shown these reports and that arsenic has nothing to do with fracking. Pitzarella cited a study by the Center for Rural Pennsylvania that found that 40 percent of Pennsylvania's water wells had at least one pre-existing water-quality problem, and that there was no obvious influence on private water-well quality from fracking. In a previous study, 2 percent of the state's wells had arsenic levels that exceeded health standards.
Soon Haney and her kids began to notice that even outdoors it smelled a lot like the shower -- a combination of sweet metal, rotten eggs and raw sewage. Talking to neighbors, Haney learned that atop a hill, about 1,500 feet from her home and less than 800 feet from that of her neighbor, Beth Voyles, there was an open, five-acre chemical impoundment filled with chemically treated water.
Haney figured out how to navigate Google Earth on her son's computer. (She doesn't own one, nor does she have an e-mail address.) There was her gravel driveway and her house hidden under the canopy of maple trees. And there was the six-football-field-square black pond that dwarfed her neighbor's silver-roofed house. The grass surrounding the pond looked dead.
Popular concerns about natural-gas drilling have centered on what chemicals companies are putting into the earth, not least because this list is a proprietary secret. In 2005, Vice President Dick Cheney spearheaded an amendment to the energy bill, which critics call the Halliburton Loophole. This legislation exempts hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act and protects companies like Halliburton, of which Cheney was once the C.E.O., from disclosing what chemicals are going into the ground.
But the problem, it turns out, lies also in the dissolved substances coming out: namely salts (bromides, chlorides), radionuclides like strontium and barium, as well as what are commonly called BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene), volatile organic compounds that can be injurious to human health.
The industry acknowledges that the question of how to handle the wastewater that comes from fracking is one of its most pressing problems. In Pennsylvania this problem is particularly acute. Pennsylvania's geological formations, unlike those of other states where natural-gas drilling has occurred, don't allow for the usual method of disposal: injection wells that store flowback deep below the earth's surface. Disposing of the chemical water has meant trucking it to another state or paying local treatment facilities to process it. The facilities, which are not equipped to remove salts, have often sent the frack water back into local rivers. In 2008, a United States Steel plant in Clairton, Pa., complained that the water from the Monongahela River was unfit for use. Loaded with salts, the water tasted and smelled odd and was corroding not only industrial equipment but also dishwashers and kitchen faucets. For several months, the Monongahela River, which provides most people in the Pittsburgh area with drinking water, no longer met state and federal standards. Following a request from the State of Pennsylvania, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found it would require five times the amount of water in their reservoirs to dilute the river. It took five months to clean it up.
''Salt is a serious problem,'' Rose Reilly, a water biologist for the Army Corps of Engineers, said. It has to be managed like any other pollutant. ''It isn't biodegradable.''
This past spring, in response to public outcry, Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection asked gas companies to stop sending flowback to treatment plants. But it was a request -- not a regulation. And enacting such measures is expensive. Shale gas is different from other kinds of oil exploration because there's no eureka moment. If you drill, you're sure to hit it. ''This is a widget business,'' says Bobby Vagt, president of the Heinz Endowment, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit that supports development in southwestern Pennsylvania; he ran gas and oil companies in Texas for 15 years. ''The lower you can keep the costs -- of every step of the process, including pipelines and road building -- the more money you're going to make.''
The challenge, as Tim Kelsey, a professor of agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State, points out, ''is making sure that the community isn't left holding the bag.'' This is an economic issue as much as an environmental one. Banks have expressed reluctance to back home mortgages within up to three miles of a well. Whole towns could become brown fields, and home values would drop precipitously. Currently, companies operating in Pennsylvania pay no tax to extract gas. (Gov. Tom Corbett reportedly received at least $1 million in campaign donations from gas interests.) Corbett recently introduced legislation that would levy fees that critics say would amount to a tax of 1 percent per well on gas extraction, significantly lower than Arkansas (3.54 percent) and Texas (5.4 percent). Pennsylvania Democrats call the measure, which they see as friendly to oil and gas interests, ''Drill, baby, drill.''
But for men like Bill Hartley and others who welcome the arrival of fracking in the state, it's not the politics of deep drilling that matter. What matters is preserving common resources. ''My one concern is our water,'' Hartley said. ''My grandfather taught me water is life.''
On Sunday May 8, 2011, Mother's Day, when Haney and her kids were returning from dinner at a nearby Cracker Barrel restaurant, they turned onto McAdams Road, and the smell of raw sewage was ''enough to make you gag,'' Haney's daughter, Paige, told me. They weren't the only ones to smell it. Beth Voyles, Haney's neighbor, called the Department of Environmental Protection to register yet another complaint about the stench. The D.E.P. sent out a water specialist, John Carson. His field notes, made public following a subpoena, indicate that he, too, smelled a ''strong odor'' at the impoundment but not on her property. Voyles claims that Carson refused to take her complaint. When asked for comment, a D.E.P. spokesman, Kevin Sunday, said in an e-mail that the ''D.E.P. responds promptly to any and all complaints. There is an ongoing investigation into the impoundment. This is a matter of active litigation and cannot be discussed further.'' Range Resources says that the D.E.P. visited the area on 24 separate occasions and found no malodor.
Range Resources did have an explanation: the power had failed at the impoundment, shutting down the aerators that move oxygen into the water to prevent bacteria from growing. Range Resources maintains that a D.E.P. study from 2010 indicates no air pollution of any kind at the pond next door to the Haneys and the Voyleses, or anywhere else, for that matter. Critics of this study say the effect of fracking on air quality remains underinvestigated.
That same day, when Voyles told Range Resources she had developed blisters in her nose, it offered to put her up in a hotel, as it does for all nuisance complaints, but she didn't want to leave her dogs and horses behind. (Range later said that it had no record of the complaint.) Next door on McAdams Road, Haney and her kids began to have intense periods of dizziness and nosebleeds. Of the three, Harley was the worst off. Haney took him to their family physician, Craig Fox, in the nearby town of Washington. Like most local doctors, Dr. Fox had never seen such symptoms before.
Haney says that Dr. Fox's advice to her was unequivocal: ''Get Harley out of that house right away. I don't want him anywhere near there, even driving by, for 30 days.'' So Haney took Harley to a friend's house in Eighty-Four, a town named for the lumber company. She took her daughter to her parents' house in Amity. Each day, she spent about four hours in the car shuttling the kids from school, to and from friends' homes and driving to the farm to feed the animals, which were O.K. some days and vomiting or collapsing on others. Haney found a cousin willing to take her pigs, but she had nowhere to house the other animals, so they remained at the farm. She stayed home for less than an hour at a time, long enough to put a load of laundry into the washer. Every two days, she spent $50 on gas. Their farmhouse stood abandoned. ''Our home has become a $300,000 cat mansion,'' Haney said when I visited her in July.
Haney is no left-leaning environmentalist; she is a self-proclaimed redneck who is proud to trace her roots here back at least 150 years. This is not the kind of fight she usually takes on. ''I'm not going to sit back and let them make my kids sick,'' she says. ''People ask me why I don't just move out, but where would I go? I can't afford another mortgage, and if I default on this place, we will lose it. ''
Beth Voyles is equally frustrated. Although the results of her medical tests are inconclusive, she complains of blisters in her nose and throat, headaches and nosebleeds, joint aches, rashes, an inability to concentrate, a metal taste in her mouth. Voyles filed suit against the Department of Environmental Protection in May. Range Resources chose to join the case, because its rights are also at stake. Documents from industry sources and the D.E.P. -- now a matter of public record -- support the suit's allegations of a series of structural violations and hazardous incidents surrounding the pond. They include half a dozen tears in the pond's plastic liner (at least one caused by a deer -- its carcass had to be dragged out); at least four cracks in a temporary plastic transfer pipeline leading to an open field; two truck spills, one of which contaminated a cattle pasture; and a leak in an adjacent pond that held drill cuttings. Range admits that after this leak, the level of total dissolved solids, or salts, spiked in the water. Of all these violations, the D.E.P. issued a citation for only the last. The D.E.P. declined to comment, citing the ongoing case.
In mid-July, Voyles's 25-year-old daughter, Ashley, was riding her paint gelding, Dude, behind the chemical pond. Ashley could hear a hissing and bubbling sound in the stream. There were pools of red foamy oil slick. ''It was rainbow water,'' Ashley said. The next morning Haney and Voyles called in the alphabet soup of government agencies they've contacted over the past year to test the water in the pools: the D.E.P., the E.P.A., the Fish and Boat Commission. They also called Range Resources. Sunday, the D.E.P. spokesman, said that it was most likely decayed vegetation that gave off gas. Later, test results of the area commissioned by Range Resources revealed the presence of acetone, toluene, benzene, phenol, arsenic, barium, heavy metals and methane. The company maintains that none of these were found in drinking water.
Bill Hartley, Rick Baker, Beth Voyles and Stacey Haney received their first royalty checks this summer from the nine gas wells that lie on the square mile between them. Stacey used most of her $9,000 check to pay off the bills she incurred: $4,500 went to co-pays and deductibles for doctors' visits; $1,150 went to pay for gas. She set $2,700 aside to pay taxes on the earnings. The remaining $750 she used as a down payment on a camper. Haney finally moved the kids to live behind her parents' home in Amity. Subsequently, the benzene and toluene levels in each of her children's urine dropped precipitously. For Haney, who continues to return to the farm to feed the animals every evening, the benzene and toluene levels remain higher. Harley still suffers from acute nausea, for which his doctor has prescribed Zofran, a medication frequently given to chemotherapy patients. ''They've ruined our lives,'' Haney said. ''I have to worry every day if my kids are going to have cancer. I will worry for the rest of my life about them with the amount of carcinogens we now have in our blood. We've lost everything -- our pets, the value of our house. No amount of money that we'd ever get from royalties would ever replace my children's health.''
The people of Amwell are no strangers to the price of development -- the loss of a farm's spring, the sinking of a family home when the coal mine burrows beneath it -- or the price of its absence -- shuttered mills and lost jobs. But given our energy needs, the use of fracking and the number of wells are likely to grow. The question is whether regulations to address environmental and health issues can keep pace with a booming industry.
Haney's neighbors have heard about Harley's illness. ''I don't know what to make of it,'' his cousin Bill Hartley says. ''It could very well be there's a leak in the pond.'' Haney's neighbor Rick Baker is also unsure of what the problem is. ''I don't deny there's something going on there,'' he said. ''It concerns me.'' He called Range Resources after it first delivered the water buffalo to say he was glad the company was taking care of the problem. Baker stands by the positive impact the industry has had on Amwell and thousands of other townships. ''This is definitely the right thing for Western Pennsylvania,'' he says. ''We're sitting on one of the largest natural-gas reserves in the world. We need this natural gas to keep functioning.'' And the economic benefits were essential, he adds. ''There are still people sitting in bars waiting for the steel mills to reopen.'' Yet Baker says he feels different from the way he did six months ago, when we first spoke. ''The safety and environmental issues have to be addressed,'' he says. The future scares him. With big oil -- Chevron, BP, among others -- looking to get involved in the industry, Baker fears that it won't be accountable to individuals like himself and Haney.
Haney still made it to this year's Washington County Fair, where her daughter, Paige, lost the Spam bake-off. Paige's goat, Crunch, won first place, and her rabbit, Phantom, almost took best in show. As usual, Pappy's butternuts placed first. In the fair's main hall at the craft division, a glossy ribbon hung from a child's three-foot high Lego Patterson rig, a model of a gas well. It won first prize.

HEADLINE: Deficit Panel Faces a Rift Over Who Ought to Pay

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY and ROBERT PEAR; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The second-ranking Senate Republican declared Saturday that the work of a special Congressional committee on deficit reduction was all but over, and said efforts to strike a bipartisan deal had been worthy but unavailing.
As he emerged from his office in the Capitol, the Republican, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a committee member, spoke of the panel in the past tense, using sober words to describe a seemingly unsuccessful 10-week quest for a compromise. Asked to describe the focus of a possible compromise, Mr. Kyl said, ''I'm not sure there is one.''
But he did not completely close the door, saying that any announcement about the conclusion of the committee's work would come from its two leaders: Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas.
''A lot of things were sent to C.B.O.,'' Mr. Kyl said, a reference to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which is supposed to analyze any package by Monday. He said it was ''pretty doubtful'' those proposals could turn into a deal, but added, ''obviously nobody wants to quit until the stroke of midnight.'' 
The 12-member committee is supposed to find ways to reduce federal budget deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years and is to vote on any final recommendations by Wednesday. If the committee fails to agree on a plan, or if Congress fails to pass it, automatic cuts go into effect starting in 2013.
With time running out, the committee members are stymied by a deep rift over whether affluent Americans should help reduce the deficit by paying more taxes.
Republicans hold that the committee's plan should consist mainly of spending cuts, not tax increases, even proposing to lower income tax rates for all who pay, including the rich. Democrats argue that that is unfair, fearing tax cuts would require even more cuts government programs for the poor.
In recent weeks, conservative Republicans have clashed among themselves over whether to accept tax increases as part of a deal to reduce the deficit. Senator Kyl appeared to acknowledge this rift on Saturday, saying, ''It's a real problem for Republicans.''
The dispute involves complex tax policy details and revenue projections. But at its core, the fight has been over who should be shouldering the burden of deficit reduction in a time of stagnating median incomes and growing disparity.
Income disparities have become a major issue in the 2012 election season. Democrats are eager to move the debate away from the stagnating economy, and to cast Republicans as the protectors of the super-rich. Republicans accuse Democrats of ''class warfare.''
But Republicans, too, are showing sensitivity to the disparity. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin released a detailed report on income equality last week, and Mitt Romney has centered his presidential economic platform on aiding the middle class.
A major plan advanced by Republicans on Nov. 7 came from Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania: $890 billion in far-reaching spending cuts and $250 billion in revenue increases, according to aides. It would raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67 from 65 and uses a less generous cost-of-living estimate to trim $160 billion from Social Security.
The proposal also includes an income tax cut for households. A high-income family would not pay the current top marginal rate of 35 percent, or as suggested by the Obama administration, the Clinton-era rate of 39.6 percent. Its top marginal rate would be 28 percent. The lowest bracket would drop to 8 percent from 10 percent.
To make up lost income-tax revenue and to shrink the deficit, Republicans would curb $3.5 trillion dollars' worth of tax breaks, items like credits and exemptions for retirement savings, child care and dependents. (The plan does not specify which ones would be cut.)
Democrats have rejected the Toomey proposal, in part because it would reduce tax rates for the most affluent Americans.
On Thursday, Republicans sent Democrats a more modest proposal, to save $643 billion over 10 years, about half of the goal. Mr. Kyl said he was hopeful about this offer because it did not include any cuts in Medicare or Medicaid.
But Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a Democratic member of the committee, said Democrats had rejected the proposal because it included large cuts in spending and only a small amount of new revenue.
Mr. Toomey defended his plan in the Republicans' weekly radio address on Saturday, but he also stressed that ''the best way to revive the American economy is to reform our broken tax code.'' He advocated replacing it ''with a system that will lower tax rates for every single American,'' and ''get rid of the special-interest tax breaks and loopholes.''
The Republicans' deficit-reduction plan might wrench the country back toward the black. But it would do so on the backs of lower- and middle-income families, some economists say.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, estimated that a household earning more than $1 million would see a 4 percent increase in its after-tax income under the Toomey proposal. Meanwhile, because of the loss of deductions, some middle-class families could actually pay more in taxes.
''The combined result of such a package would be tax increases for lower- and middle-income people to finance further tax cuts (beyond those that the Bush tax cuts already provide) for wealthy people, with a small contribution to deficit reduction,'' the budget center's staff wrote.
And some Democratic-leaning economists worry that the plans being considered have generally contained too few tax increases and too many spending cuts.
''Past budget-closing agreements in the 1980s and 1990s rested much more heavily on progressive tax increases and explicitly protected programs for those with modest incomes,'' said Jacob S. Hacker, a professor of political science at Yale and a co-author of ''Winner-Take-All Politics,'' published in 2010. ''We are talking today about maintaining the Bush tax cuts that most aid the rich, cutting tax expenditures in ways that put much of the burden on the middle, and leaving most of the deficit-reduction work to cuts in popular programs on which middle- and lower-income Americans rely.''
The deficit committee's deliberations come at a time of increasing inequality -- an economic phenomenon brought to broad public attention by the Occupy Wall Street movement and a debate on tax cuts for the rich.
A C.B.O. report released in October found that between 1979 and 2007, incomes increased 275 percent for the top 1 percent of households, but just 18 percent for the bottom 20 percent.
Changes in how the government taxes and spends contributed to some of the increase in inequality, the budget office said.
It found that households in the lowest income quintile received 54 percent of social program payments, like Social Security benefits and food stamps, in 1979.
But by 2007, those households received just 36 percent of such payments. The tax burden on the rich -- at the heart of the committee's logjam -- has grown lighter over time. Research by the economists Emmanuel Saez, of the University of California at Berkeley, and Thomas Piketty, of the Paris School of Economics in France, found that the top one-thousandth of earners paid approximately 53.7 percent of their income in federal taxes in 1980. By 2004, that rate had fallen to 33.7 percent.
Lawmakers from both parties are under intense pressure to stand firm against compromise. But efforts are under way to counter the pressure, by those who argue that the consequences of failure would be great.
In a letter last week to committee members, the head of the group Third Way, Jon Cowan, warned against a deal that met the committee's mandate with smoke and mirrors. While allowing both parties to declare victory, he said, it ''would risk further entrenching the growing cynicism that is poisoning our political system.''

HEADLINE: Headphones With Swagger (and Lots of Bass)

BYLINE: By ANDREW J. MARTIN

 BODY:
DR. DRE, the sonic architect of gangsta rap, is surrounded by a gaggle of slack-jawed journalists and micro-skirted cocktail waitresses. It's not quite 5 in the afternoon, and already the scene is a testosterone fantasy of swaggering grooves and flowing vodka.
Dr. Dre, however, is here on business.
Born Andre Young, he was a founding member of N.W.A. and honed the sound of Snoop Dogg, Eminem and 50 Cent. But now what began as a sideline has turned into multimillion-dollar business.
Mr. Young is the pitchman for the hot new sound in -- headphones. On this October day, he is headlining a media party in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan for his creations, Beats by Dr. Dre. 
To the surprise of almost everyone, except him and his partners, Beats have redefined the lowly headphone, as well as how much people are willing to pay for a pair of them. A typical pair of Beats sell for about $300 -- nearly 10 times the price of ear buds that come with iPods. And, despite these lean economic times, they are selling surprisingly fast.
Whether Beats are worth the money is open to debate. Reviews are mixed, but many people love them. The headphones are sleekly Apple-esque, which is no surprise, since they were created by a former designer at Apple. Beats also offer a celebrity vibe and a lot of boom-a-chick-a-boom bass.
So much bass, in fact, that some audio experts say that Beats distort the sound of the music.
''In terms of sound performance, they are among the worst you can buy,'' says Tyll Hertsens, editor in chief of InnerFidelity.com, a site for audiophiles. ''They are absolutely, extraordinarily bad.''
Time was, manufacturers marketed high-priced audio equipment by emphasizing technical merits like frequency response, optimum impedance, ambient noise attenuation and so on. The audience was mostly a small cadre of audiophiles tuned to the finer points of sound quality.
But, three years ago, Beats by Dr. Dre set out to change all that by appealing to more primal desires: good looks, celebrity and bone-rattling bass. Annual sales are approaching $500 million, and Beats have transformed headphones into a fashion accessory.
This unlikely success has touched off a scramble in the industry. The rappers Ludacris and 50 Cent have backed their own headphone brands. Lawsuits are flying. Beats and its partner, Monster Cable, have sued some competitors, alleging patent infringement. The maker of Soul by Ludacris headphones, in turn, has sued Beats and Monster, contending that they are ''attempting to use litigation threats to stifle legitimate competition.''
However the lawsuits play out, the entire industry is riding a wave. Sales of headphones in the United States nearly doubled in the year ended in August, to $2 billion, according to the NPD Group's Retail Tracking Service.
Beats by Dr. Dre ''set off a free-for-all among companies entering the category, many of which relied on celebrity endorsements or style, as opposed to focusing on audio quality per se,'' said Ross Rubin, the executive director of industry analysis at NPD.
''What Beats did,'' Mr. Rubin added, ''was dramatically expand the market and make the price premium acceptable, as much as for the design and the brand as for the audio quality.''
Even old-line headphone makers have benefited, though they dismiss the rapper-backed headphones as more about marketing than audio quality.
Stefanie Reichert, vice president of strategic marketing for Sennheiser USA, said Beats was the first to market headphones as a lifestyle choice, rather than as a piece of audio equipment.
''Hats off to them, I have to say,'' Ms. Reichert said.
JIMMY IOVINE, the chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M Records, has had a long, profitable relationship with Mr. Young and teamed up with him on Beats.
The two make an odd pair. With a smooth baritone, Mr. Young spun tales about gangs, sex and crack in South Central Los Angeles into multimillion-selling rap albums. In person, Mr. Young, a burly 46-year-old, says little and chooses his words carefully.
Mr. Iovine, 58, made his name as a record producer. He is also credited with helping to discover Lady Gaga and Eminem, whose demo tape he gave to Mr. Young. A slight, wiry and hyperactive Brooklyn native in blue-tinted glasses and a baseball cap, Mr. Iovine talks so much more than Mr. Young that he jokes, ''I'm his Charlie McCarthy, I really am.''
Beats was a result of a chance meeting on a California beach several years ago, Mr. Iovine said. Mr. Young lamented that his lawyer wanted to peddle Dr. Dre-branded sneakers. Mr. Iovine responded: forget sneakers, sell speakers (although he used a different F-word).
His interest in getting into the headphone business was prompted by what he calls a steady decline in the quality of audio equipment and of recordings, as they have been compressed into digital files. That process allows more songs to be loaded onto a mobile device, but doing so eliminates some of the music's complexity.
At that time, Mr. Iovine said headphones had become a commodity, and ''everything that came out kept making the sound worse, and worse and worse.''
He continued: ''You wouldn't watch 'Avatar' on a small screen with a blurry picture, and yet people were consuming music like that. So we said: 'You know, everything else out there looks like medical equipment right now. Let's make it look cool and have a good vibe about it. But yet make it powerful.' ''
The duo signed a deal with Monster Cable, which makes cables for audio and video components, and it spent several years perfecting a design, Mr. Iovine said. The first pair of Beats was released in the fall of 2008, about the time the slowing economy went into a tailspin. ''Everyone told us it was impossible,'' Mr. Iovine said. ''We just went for it.''
He dismissed those who criticize the sound quality of Beats. Competitors use fancy equipment to determine how headphones should sound, he said, whereas he and Mr. Young simply know how they should sound.
''The way we hear music is almost the opposite of the way these sound companies hear music,'' he said.
Many rave about the sound. Consumer Reports gave Beats' Studio headphones among its highest rankings in a recent review.
''I don't know what I'd do without Beats,'' said Sequoia Hill, 24, a music producer from Brooklyn, who owns three pairs. ''They are flawless.''
Other headphone manufacturers are hoping to cash in on the Beats' success.
''We saw that Beats owned that urban rap, higher price point,'' said Tim Hickman, who makes Fanny Wang headphones. He set out to create similar headphones that would appeal particularly to women.
As such, he said Fanny Wang's ''very youthful, urban-y sound'' was different than that of Beats, too. In October, Beats and Monster settled their lawsuit against Fanny Wang, with no money being exchanged, Mr. Hickman said.
Meanwhile, 50 Cent, born Curtis Jackson, is selling headphones called Sync by 50. He says he got into the headphone business because he had ''an interest in people hearing music the way I hear it in the studio.'' He is focusing on top-quality wireless headphones that he says are superior to his competitors, including Beats.
Nonetheless, Mr. Jackson praised Beats and its owners. In fact, he said he would have happily joined forces with Beats, which has released versions of its headphones by Lady Gaga, P Diddy and Justin Bieber.
''Now it's part of the culture. You are almost making a fashion statement,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''Because of the price, it says something about the guy who has it around his neck.''
Through a spokesman, Ludacris declined to comment about his Soul by Ludacris headphones. In its lawsuit, filed in June, Signeo USA, which makes them, said Beats and Monster were threatening litigation simply to undermine the success of Soul headphones.
EVEN the best headphones can't improve a lousy recording.
Mr. Iovine acknowledged the challenge but said music still sounded better on Beats than on most other headphones. He said his goals extended well beyond headphones, to improving the quality of audio in cars, as well as on personal computers and other consumer electronics, in much the same way that high definition improved the visual quality of television.
Cellphones will be crucial, since they are the primary music player for a growing number of people. In August, Beats announced that the HTC Corporation, a mobile device maker based in Taiwan, had invested $300 million in the company, giving it a majority stake. Beats technology has already been incorporated into some HTC smartphones.
''We can't be late to the phone like we were online,'' Mr. Iovine says. ''Remember, Napster was out of business for three years before our music became available legally on iTunes. That's a disaster.''
He envisions offering music by subscription on cellphones -- much as cable offers TV by subscription -- with Beats providing the audio. The music industry, he said, has to make the transition to cellphones, and do it with style.
''It's not sexy,'' he said. ''And it's got to be sexy.''
For the time being, Beats will continue to deploy its marketing razzle-dazzle. It recently opened a pop-up store in SoHo where its headphones are displayed like works of art. Brian Miller, 26, of Queens, stopped by recently and bought a Beats T-shirt. He said he owns a pair of red Beats, which he produced from his backpack.
''They're dope,'' said Mr. Miller. He works at a Web site about the rap industry, RapRadar.com, and said he loved the sound quality but seemed less impressed with all the Beats pizazz -- like the sight of men wearing Beats around their necks at clubs or while driving.
''I'm not a schmuck,'' he said. ''That's like wearing sunglasses at night.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 27, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about Beats by Dr. Dre, a line of headphones, referred incorrectly to one aspect of the early career of Jimmy Iovine, the music executive and record producer who teamed up with Dr. Dre on the Beats venture. Although Mr. Iovine was a recording engineer for John Lennon and Bruce Springsteen, he did not produce their records.

HEADLINE: Obama By the Numbers

 BODY:
I read with great interest Nate Silver's article, ''Handicapping Obama 2012,'' in connection with the models used in his and others' analyses. One question I would have liked to see addressed: Per Silver's model, if the categories of approval ratings and the national economic performance are still unimproved (or if they worsen) by the 2012 election, Obama will not be able to defeat Romney, given the latter's moderate ideological score. Yet large percentages of Republicans are still displaying an ''anybody but Romney'' attitude sufficient to propel a series of extremist candidates into a tie with him. That being the case, why the assumption that the multitudes of apparent Romney haters (that is, those rejecting him when he is manifestly the most electable candidate in the pack) will support him in 2012?
GINNY MAYER, Dana Point, Calif. 
I learned politics going door to door in Missoula, Mont., organizing low-income families living in mobile homes. Whether in a small town or on a national stage, politics is always about people -- not statistical models or formulas. In performing a cold, mechanical analysis based on only three variables, Nate Silver discounts the strengths of our values and our organization. His article assumes that next November's outcome is predetermined, and that our unprecedented grass-roots network of organizers and volunteers -- not to mention the president -- play no role.
We respectfully disagree. We don't expect it to be easy -- but that's why we're already hard at work. Here are some numbers Silver ignores: More than one million people have taken ownership of this campaign, most with small contributions -- and we reached that mark six months faster than last time. Volunteers have had more than a million conversations with their neighbors. Last week, one year from Election Day, more than 10,000 volunteers participated in events around the country.
And Silver ignores my favorite number: 270. As he knows, presidential elections are still decided in the Electoral College. I understand the allure of predictions, but these models have well-known flaws. Just last year, Silver's formula gave Harry Reid the remotest odds of winning; he was re-elected by more than five points. Four years ago today, pretty much every analysis predicted Obama would lose in 2008.
Silver strains to quantify the G.O.P. candidates' ideology, disregarding their uniform endorsement of the same Tea Party policies that drive Republicans in Congress: failed ideas like letting Wall Street write its own rules again, and asking seniors and middle-class families to pay for tax breaks and loopholes for the wealthiest.
As a statistician, Silver views politics through a prism of probability. But what we've all learned from Barack Obama, the unlikeliest of candidates, is that politics isn't about what's probable -- it's about what's possible.
JIM MESSINA, Obama '12 Campaign Manager, Chicago
It's amazing that Jon Huntsman can, on paper, match up so well against Obama and yet be a nobody in the G.O.P. field. One problem with Silver's formula, however, is that Huntsman fares well against Obama in part because, by Silver's metrics, he's closer to mainstream political views than other Republicans. It's simply not the case that Romney is more conservative than Huntsman. In fact, just this morning Huntsman provided a contrast with Romney by going much further than Romney's tentative embrace of a possible Medicare reform measure.
JOSEPH LAWLER, American Spectator blog, Nov. 4
Two factors elude Silver's thoughtful models. First, nobody seems to like Mitt Romney at all. Nobody knows what he stands for. Second, Silver polls Romney as a moderate, but it is not clear that Romney is a moderate or that he will be perceived as one after his opponents try to pin down his currently undefined image. No one whose legal team includes Robert Bork is any kind of moderate.

HEADLINE: Conspiracies, Coups and Currencies

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
The murmurs about Barack Obama being forced out began in Berlin and Beijing. After his party lost the midterm vote, there were hints that a government of technocrats would be imposed on America, to save the country from a debt crisis and the world from a depression.
As the debt-ceiling negotiations stalled out over the summer, a global coalition -- led by Germany, China and the International Monetary Fund -- began working behind the scenes to ease Obama out of the White House. The credit downgrade was the final blow: the president had lost the confidence of the world's shadow government, and his administration could no longer survive. 
Within days, thanks to some unusual constitutional maneuvering, Obama resigned the presidency and Michael Bloomberg was invited to take the oath of office. With Beijing issuing veiled threats against our currency, Congress had no choice but to turn the country's finances over to the Senate's bipartisan Gang of 6, which in turn acceded to Chinese and German ''supervision'' of their negotiations. Meanwhile, there was a growing consensus in Europe and Asia that only a true global superstate could prevent the debt contagion from spreading ...
FOR Americans, the scenario I've just imagined is a paranoid fantasy, the kind of New World Order nightmare that haunts the sleep of black-helicopter watchers and Trilateral Commission obsessives.
But for the inhabitants of Italy and Greece, who have just watched democratically elected governments toppled by pressure from financiers, European Union bureaucrats and foreign heads of state, it evokes the cold reality of 21st-century politics. Democracy may be nice in theory, but in a time of crisis it's the technocrats who really get to call the shots. National sovereignty is a pretty concept, but the survival of the European common currency comes first.
There were few tears in Italy and Greece for Silvio Berlusconi and George Papandreou, the prime ministers -- respectively corrupt and hapless -- whose downfalls were engineered by the Brussels-Berlin-Paris axis. But their forced departures, however welcome, open a troubling window on what a true European state would look like. Stability would be achieved at the expense of democracy: the rituals of parliaments and elections would endure, but the real decision-making power would pass permanently to the forces represented by the so-called ''Frankfurt Group'' -- an ad hoc inner circle consisting of Germany's Angela Merkel, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and a cluster of bankers and E.U. functionaries, which has been spearheaded European crisis management since October.
The preview is important because this is precisely the future that almost every informed commentator assumes Europe needs to embrace in order to save the euro and prevent an economic meltdown. The old conventional wisdom held that a continentwide currency union was a wonderful idea, and that euroskeptics were all knuckle-dragging troglodytes. The new conventional wisdom is that yes, well, maybe the knuckle-draggers were right about the perils of the euro, but it's far too late to back out now.
Or at least it's too late at the moment. After the current crisis has passed, some voices have suggested, there will be time to reverse the ongoing centralization of power and reconsider the E.U.'s increasingly undemocratic character. Today the Continent needs a unified fiscal policy and a central bank that's willing to behave like the Federal Reserve, Bloomberg View's Clive Crook has suggested. But as soon as the euro is stabilized, Europe's leaders should start ''giving popular sovereignty some voice in other aspects of the E.U. project.''
This seems like wishful thinking. Major political consolidations are rarely undone swiftly, and they just as often build upon themselves. The technocratic coups in Greece and Italy have revealed the power that the E.U.'s leadership can exercise over the internal politics of member states. If Germany has to effectively backstop the Continent's debt in order to save the European project, it's hard to see why the Frankfurt Group (its German members, especially) would ever consent to dilute that power.
One could argue that the Greeks and Italians -- and the Spanish and the Irish and everyone else -- should have known what they were signing up for when they joined the euro in the first place. But the fact is that the project of European union has never enjoyed deep popular support. Its advocates were always adept at re-running referendums until the vote came out their way, or designing treaties that bypassed the voting public entirely. The people of Europe have always been wary of trading their sovereignty for ever-greater unity -- and now we can see why.
From the American perspective, a more centralized and undemocratic Europe is clearly preferable to the risk of another recession. For the staggering world economy, it would be disastrous if a burst of nationalism somehow broke up Europe's common currency.
But that's easy for us to say: it isn't our self-government that's at stake.

HEADLINE: Occupy The Agenda

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Maureen Dowd and Frank Bruni are off today.

 BODY:
YOU have to wonder: Could Mayor Michael Bloomberg and police chiefs around the country be secretly backing the Occupy Wall Street movement?
The Occupy protests might have died in infancy if a senior police official had not pepper-sprayed young women on video. Harsh police measures in other cities, including a clash in Oakland that put a veteran in intensive care and the pepper-spraying of an 84-year-old woman in Seattle, built popular support.
Just in the last few days, Bloomberg -- who in other respects has been an excellent mayor -- rescued the movement from one of its biggest conundrums. It was stuck in a squalid encampment in Manhattan's Zuccotti Park: antagonizing local residents, scaring off would-be supporters, and facing months of debilitating snow and rain. Then the mayor helped save the demonstrators by clearing them out, thus solving their real estate problem and re-establishing their narrative of billionaires bullying the disenfranchised. Thanks to the mayor, the protests grew bigger than ever. 
I watched in downtown Manhattan last week as the police moved in to drag off protesters -- and several credentialed journalists -- and the action seemed wildly over the top. Sure, the mayor had legitimate concerns about sanitation and safety, but have you looked around New York City? Many locations aren't so clean and safe, but there usually aren't hundreds of officers in riot gear showing up in the middle of the night to address the problem.
Yet in a larger sense, the furor over the eviction of protesters in New York, Oakland, Portland and other cities is a sideshow. Occupy Wall Street isn't about real estate, and its signal achievement was not assembling shivering sleepers in a park.
The high ground that the protesters seized is not an archipelago of parks in America, but the national agenda. The movement has planted economic inequality on the nation's consciousness, and it will be difficult for any mayor or police force to dislodge it.
A reporter for Politico found that use of the words ''income inequality'' quintupled in a news database after the Occupy protests began. That's a significant achievement, for this is an issue that goes to our country's values and our opportunities for growth -- and yet we in the news business have rarely given it the attention it deserves.
The statistic that takes my breath away is this: The top 1 percent of Americans possess a greater net worth than the entire bottom 90 percent, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute.
A new study by Michael I. Norton of Harvard Business School and Dan Ariely of Duke University polled Americans about what wealth distribution would be optimal. People across the board thought that the richest 20 percent of Americans should control about one-third of the nation's wealth, and the poorest 20 percent about one-tenth.
In fact, the richest 20 percent of Americans own more than 80 percent of the country's wealth. And the poorest 20 percent own one-tenth of 1 percent.
It would be easier to accept this gulf between the haves and the have-nots if it could be spanned by intelligence and hard work. Sometimes it can. But over all, such upward mobility in the United States seems more constrained than in the supposed class societies of Europe.
Research by the Economic Mobility Project, which explores accessibility to the American dream, suggests that the United States provides less intergenerational mobility than most other industrialized nations do. That's not only because of tax policy, which is what liberals focus on. Perhaps even more important are educational investments, like early childhood education, to try to even the playing field. We can't solve inequality unless we give poor and working-class kids better educational opportunities.
The Occupy movement is also right that one of the drivers of inequality (among many) is the money game in politics. Michael Spence, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who shares a concern about rising inequality, told me that we've seen ''an evolution from one propertied man, one vote; to one man, one vote; to one person, one vote; trending to one dollar, one vote.''
James M. Stone, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in a recent speech that many members of Congress knew that banks needed to be more tightly regulated, perhaps broken into smaller pieces.
''So why was this not done?'' he asked. ''One obvious piece of the answer is that both political parties rely heavily on campaign contributions from the financial sector.''
The solution to these inequities and injustices is not so much setting up tents at bits of real estate here or there, but a relentless focus on the costs of inequality. So as we move into an election year, I'm hoping that the movement will continue to morph into: Occupy the Agenda.

HEADLINE: Romney Shifts In Iowa, Playing To Win Quickly

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- The answer to one of the great lingering questions about the Republican presidential race has suddenly turned up here along Ingersoll Avenue, where Mitt Romney's Iowa campaign headquarters is opening for business.
Mr. Romney, who has been cautiously calibrating expectations about his chances in a state full of social conservatives, is now playing to win the Iowa caucuses. Television commercials are on the way, volunteers are arriving and a stealth operation is ready to burst into view in the weeks leading up to the caucuses, the first Republican nominating contest, on Jan. 3.
The escalation of his effort in Iowa, along with a more aggressive schedule in New Hampshire and an expanding presence in South Carolina, is the strongest indication yet that Mr. Romney is shifting from a defensive, make-no-mistakes crouch to an assertive offensive strategy. If he can take command in the three early-voting states, he could make the nominating battle a swift one.
''There is a lot of wisdom in trying to deliver a knockout punch,'' said Matt Schultz, the Iowa secretary of state, who supported Mr. Romney four years ago but is unaligned now. ''If he came and won Iowa and New Hampshire, it would be all over.'' 
The campaign is trying to capitalize on what Republicans perceive as a new opening in a state that has spooked Mr. Romney since a $10 million investment in 2008 led to a second-place finish. Yet the structure of this race is different, with the absence of a single alternative candidate and only a hint from opponents of the rigorous voter identification and turnout operations that are a hallmark of the caucuses.
As several of his rivals arrived here for a weekend of campaigning, Mr. Romney was not on hand, but a former Blockbuster video store sprang to life as the nerve center of his Iowa operation. Aides hung maps and charts, turning a 6,289-square-foot storefront into a sprawling office that will be open by the time he visits on Wednesday.
But the work has been quietly under way for months, with a precise by-the-numbers strategy.
Volunteers and a skeleton staff have been diligently reconnecting with the 29,949 people who supported Mr. Romney four years ago when he won 25 percent of the vote. He fell short to former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, but party strategists say the same level of support could be enough for Mr. Romney to win because the social conservative vote is likely to split.
The campaign, which does not want its supporters to go elsewhere just because Mr. Romney did not ask for their vote, is recruiting precinct leaders and focusing its attention on counties he won. But aides are also working to identify Republicans and independents frustrated at the country's direction who could be persuaded to attend their first caucus. They will receive a nudge suggesting that spending 30 minutes on a January night is preferable to a second Obama term.
''We've held together our coalition,'' said David Kochel, the top Iowa strategist for Mr. Romney. ''Growing the universe of caucusgoers to people who are focused on the economy and beating Barack Obama is our best opportunity.''
The risk to Mr. Romney in Iowa has always been twofold.
Going for a victory and coming up short could leave him appearing weakened heading into New Hampshire, a must-win state for him. And greater visibility here means navigating social conservatives, some of whom have expressed qualms about his Mormon faith and many of whom have questions about his ideological commitment.
But Mr. Romney is approaching the caucuses far differently this time. He declined to appear at a forum on Saturday organized by a prominent social conservative activist, Bob Vander Plaats. Mr. Romney's advisers say he is not trying to persuade his critics to support him, but rather to find voters who like his economic message and believe that he is the party's strongest nominee.
There is also the prospect for significant reward if he takes control of the race, rather than sitting back and hoping that his rivals fade.
''He has to go out there and win it,'' said Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican, who has been urging Mr. Romney to intensify his efforts in the state. ''He has to convince people that he has the passion, the plan and the ability to be president. He has some great things going for him, but he's been too cautious.''
The Romney reinforcements arriving here are a telling sign of a new engagement.
Kent Lucken, an international banker from Boston and a top foreign policy adviser and contributor to Mr. Romney, has moved back to his native Iowa for the final six weeks. He will be joined by other volunteers in their methodical effort to persuade voters -- often one phone call at a time -- that Mr. Romney offers Republicans their best chance to win back the White House.
''We know who our supporters are; the key is just to go out and deliver,'' Mr. Lucken said Friday, returning from Plymouth County, where he and his parents scoured lists of potential supporters. ''No one is organizing the ground. These other campaigns are not out there aggressively, at least today.''
Mr. Romney had always pledged to return to Iowa, telling supporters during his first visit of the year: ''You'll see me more than you like.'' But as the race stayed remarkably fluid, he kept pushing back his timetable, assuming that another candidate would start competing in his lane.
But with former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota leaving the race in August, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas struggling to find his footing and former Speaker Newt Gingrich trying to piece together a serious campaign organization, Mr. Romney is presented with a chance that his aides did not anticipate only a few months ago.
''There is a very good opportunity to finish strong,'' said David Oman, a Republican business executive here, who supported Mr. Huckabee four years ago and is now backing Mr. Romney.
His advisers are using the 2008 results as a roadmap. Polling and other research has led the campaign to believe that Mr. Romney could win not only a majority of his old supporters, but also at least a share of the 35,000 Republicans who supported Fred D. Thompson, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani four years ago.
In a presidential race that has been defined by far less traditional campaigning than in previous years, the series of televised debates has essentially served as the salad course. But Mr. Romney's steady performances have turned up in living rooms here, too, offering him a starting point to intensify his effort.
''All of the debates have made this more of a national conversation,'' said Chad Airhart, who worked on the Romney campaign four years ago and was elected last year as the Dallas County recorder. ''I can't say that I've encountered anyone who was a supporter of Romney four years ago who isn't a supporter today.''
While Mr. Romney has spent a majority of his time campaigning in New Hampshire and raising money across the country, he has remained more engaged here than it may appear from the outside. His campaign has also used Iowa to try to neutralize the potential of Mr. Perry.
Mr. Romney has conducted at least three telephone meetings with supporters, and he often reaches out personally to local Republicans. His campaign also organized two teleconferences for Iowa voters with Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, Ariz., who has sharply criticized Mr. Perry's opposition to building a fence along the Mexican border.
Television advertisements could start here and in other early-voting states by December, when Mr. Romney is scheduled to spend more time campaigning here. His task is to meet new voters and reacquaint himself with old supporters, but he does not plan to reprise an act from 2008 when he held dozens of forums called ''Ask Mitt Anything.''
This time, aides said, campaign events will be tailored so voters are encouraged to ask Mr. Romney about just one thing above all: the economy.

Giuliani, as well as a share of Mike Huckabee's votes, which will most likely be split several ways. (Source: Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections) (A18)

HEADLINE: 'Anybody but Mitt'

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS. 
A media reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL editorial page, that irascible voice of high-minded conservatism, has taken a rather dim view of Mitt Romney. ''It's hard to discern any core beliefs beyond faith in his own managerial expertise,'' it wrote in September.
The columnist George F. Will has disparaged Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, as a ''recidivist reviser of his principles,'' so uninspiring to his party that he might become the Republican version of Michael S. Dukakis.
Erick Erickson, who writes for Red State, a blog closely followed in conservative circles, has said that choosing Mr. Romney as the Republican presidential nominee would spell disaster: ''Conservatism dies and Barack Obama wins.''
Ouch. 
Mr. Romney remains at or near the top of most polls of likely Republican primary voters. He has patiently kept a low profile as one challenger after another has faltered. From the odds-makers in Las Vegas to the Sunday morning talk-show round tables, the conventional wisdom is that the nomination is his to lose.
Yet his poll approval numbers have risen only so high in the crowded Republican field -- typically less than 25 percent. And if you read, watch or listen to news media that draw large conservative audiences, it is not hard to discern a reason: a recurrent ''anybody but Mitt'' drumbeat from right-leaning pundits and media outlets that are responding to and feeding a conservative disaffection with him.
Case in point: William Kristol, editor of the neoconservative Weekly Standard, who spent much of the year pleading in vain for other Republicans to get into the race. He even published two poems he said were written by a ''mysterious dark lady'' despondent over the state of the Republican field. The ode to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey implored, ''Thus, though you may weigh near a ton/Let all band together to make you run.''
More recently, conservative news media have provided ample, initially positive, coverage to a succession of candidates with a shot at upsetting the Romney bandwagon, however short-lived those chances proved to be. There was Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, then Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, then the businessman Herman Cain.
Last week it was Newt Gingrich's turn as the latest not-Romney media fascination. With unfortunate timing, his rise to the top of several polls coincided with revelations that he accepted at least $1.6 million in consulting fees from the federally chartered mortgage giant Freddie Mac, payments that might sour small-government, Tea Party conservatives on the former House speaker.
But in some quarters he got the benefit of the doubt. The Fox News Channel devoted much of its Gingrich coverage not to the payments, but to its poll showing him as the new Republican front-runner. Bill O'Reilly of Fox even came to Mr. Gingrich's defense, calling the money ''pretty reasonable and normal.'' Rush Limbaugh's response to the revelations? ''It's a full-fledged take-'em-out media approach, and the only guy who is immune to this is Mitt Romney,'' said the talk-radio host.
SUCH coverage of Mr. Romney's rivals is at best a mixed blessing for him, as their ascent in the polls steals his thunder but also brings increased scrutiny and exposes their vulnerabilities. But does Mr. Romney even need conservative media on his side to win the nomination?
To a certain extent, yes. Mr. Romney and his strategists realize the value of wooing conservative media stars and their large audiences. And they have been doing so for months by offering the candidate up for appearances with people like Sean Hannity, whose Fox News and syndicated radio programs remain Mr. Romney's preferred media venues. He has been interviewed by Mr. Hannity 11 times this year.
Mr. Romney has also sat for interviews with, among others, Laura Ingraham and Bill Bennett -- two stalwarts of conservative radio -- and paid his respects to Greta Van Susteren and Mr. O'Reilly, part of Fox's viewer-rich prime-time lineup. He even reached out to The Wall Street Journal, which recently published an op-ed article by him on the dangers of a nuclear Iran.
Republican candidates have no shortage of complaints about the way they are covered by so-called mainstream media, but the problem for any Republican who faces an unsympathetic conservative punditocracy is that its reach extends so far, and deep into the party base. Fox draws more than double the prime-time audience of the liberal-leaning MSNBC.
Conservative radio, home to some of the most wary Romney skeptics like Mr. Limbaugh and Mark Levin, taps a particularly large pool of potential Republican voters. An average of 15 million people hear Mr. Limbaugh's program each week; about 14 million tune into Mr. Hannity's radio program. Glenn Beck, Michael Savage and Mr. Levin draw around nine million each.
As Fox learned shortly after President Obama's election, dissatisfied voters, Republican or otherwise, can translate into a ratings boom. In 2009, the year the Tea Party took off, the Fox News Channel enjoyed its best year by far, with average prime-time ratings rising 20 percent from 2008.
On conservative talk radio, you don't have to listen for very long to get a sense of how deep the skepticism of Mr. Romney runs. Mr. Savage, never one for being understated, has called him ''worthless'' and stoked conservatives' deepest fears about him: that his conservatism is skin-deep and opportunistic. ''He has not been there for us for years,'' Mr. Savage has said. ''He has no right to run for the presidency.''
Mr. Romney is working hard to neutralize such sentiments, which are rooted in now-abandoned liberal positions on abortion and universal health care held while he was Massachusetts governor. Republican Party history also explains resistance to Mr. Romney from dyed-in-the-wool conservatives in the media: in the view of many of them, the party has nominated only two truly conservative presidential candidates in generations, Barry M. Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, and, given President Obama's perceived vulnerability in 2012, they say now is not the time to nominate another RINO -- Republican In Name Only.
All this may sound familiar to anyone who followed the conservative media's 2008 revolt against John McCain, the Arizona senator with a maverick reputation for compromise with Democrats. Well after it was clear that he would win the Republican nomination, Mr. McCain was subjected to continuous scorn from the likes of Mr. Limbaugh, who declared him an impostor.
Most, including Mr. Limbaugh, did eventually come around and reluctantly embrace Mr. McCain as at least a better choice than Mr. Obama. The conservative author and commentator Ann Coulter did too, starting a Web site called getdrunkandvote4mccain.com.
Sneering at Mr. McCain in the news media was obviously not a decisive influence on primary voting. But did it have any effect in his general election defeat?
It was Mr. McCain's weak candidacy, and not negative coverage of him, that tipped the vote to Mr. Obama, said Byron York, chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner, a conservative newspaper.
''I think conservatives looked at a tired Republican Party then,'' he said. ''It was after Bush and after Republican losses in '06. And they said we just aren't going to win.'' But with an energized conservative base today, Mr. York added, ''This is different.''
Perhaps the question is not whether Mr. Romney needs the conservative media in lockstep with him, but whether they need him.
Seeing the stakes as simply too high in this election to favor ideological purity over electability, many conservative commentators may decide it is in the best interest of the Republican Party to swallow their pride and go with Mr. Romney.
''The minute he gets the nomination, they will basically fall in line behind him,'' said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax, the conservative magazine and Web site.
In fact, the queue may be forming already.
Ms. Coulter, a onetime Christie backer who had said a Romney nomination would ensure Mr. Obama's victory, is now reluctantly supporting Mr. Romney. ''You've got to go with what you have,'' she told Mr. Hannity on Fox News last month. And Michelle Malkin, the television pundit and columnist, taps a general sense of resignation with a feature on her blog called ''GOP 2012: The Hold Your Nose Tracker.''
The Wall Street Journal's editorial page has done some nose-holding of its own lately. In an editorial two weeks ago, it offered tepid praise for a speech Mr. Romney had given on economic policy. His points weren't quite as bold as what Representative Paul Ryan proposed, it grumbled, but ''it qualifies as progress.''

HEADLINE: Heaven Is A Place Called Elizabeth Warren

BYLINE: By REBECCA TRAISTER

 BODY:
On the campaign trail in Massachusetts last month with the Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren, I bore witness to acts of extreme giddiness: a 20-year-old student jumping up and down, exclaiming, ''Oh, my God, I am obsessed with her''; a third-year law student of Warren's comparing her to a superhero (''Wonder Woman wishes she could be Professor Warren''); a man stopping Warren on the street and introducing himself as the guy who recently passed her a mash note on a plane (''I was hitting on you,'' he said).
Warren has been something of a left-wing idol for a couple of years now. While heading Congressional oversight of TARP, she more than anyone asked tough questions about what, exactly, was done with all that bank bailout money. And on her subsequent mission to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- which was designed to enforce long-ignored rules meant to protect consumers entering into everything from credit-card agreements to mortgages -- Warren became a regular guest of Bill Maher's and Jon Stewart's, and both went weak for the straight-talking professor. Stewart told her he wanted to make out. 
But this fall, at exactly the time our economic forecasts started souring again and Barack Obama appeared to be at his most ineffectual, Warren's entrance into the race for Ted Kennedy's old seat turned her from a cult-hero crusader into something far bigger. A clip of Warren at a fund-raiser in Andover, Mass., talking about how ''there's nobody in this country who got rich on his own,'' reminded liberals that there was someone out there who could still articulate a muscular progovernment worldview. ''If more Democrats were able to make the case for the underlying social contract as effectively, our discourse would be vastly less mind-numbing,'' wrote Steve Benen in a Washington Monthly article that summed up what many liberals across the country were feeling.
Over its first weeks, Warren's campaign raised an impressive $3.15 million, about 70 percent of which came from out of state and 96 percent from donors giving $100 or less. That last metric is crucial, because a consumer advocate who recently said, ''The people on Wall Street broke this country,'' is not likely to enjoy big-ticket backing from the financial sector. By late October, three of her biggest primary challengers had dropped out.
Even though she's running for the Senate and not for the presidency, the early devotion to Warren recalls the ardor once felt by many for Obama. On its face, this is odd: Warren is not a world-class orator, she is not young or shiny or new, she doesn't fizz with the promise of American possibility that made the Obama campaign pop. Instead, she's a mild-mannered Harvard bankruptcy-law professor and a grandmother of three, a member of the older-white-lady demographic (she's 62) that was written off in 2008 as being the antimatter of hope and change.
And yet, on a deeper level, her popularity makes perfect sense. Embracing Warren as the next ''one'' is, in part, a way of getting over Obama; she provides an optimistic distraction from the fact that under our current president, too little has changed, for reasons having to do both with the limitations of the political system and the limitations of the man. She makes people forget that estimations of him were too overheated, trust in his powers too fervid. As the feminist philanthropist Barbara Lee told me of Warren, ''This moment of disillusion is why people find her so compelling, because she brings forth the best in people and she brings back that excitement.''
At the annual Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus dinner at the Fairmont Copley Plaza, Warren, who was not part of the night's program, cruised from table to table before the event, introducing herself to guests and blithely ignoring an M.C.'s request for people to settle down. Slipping out the door as the program began, Warren was swarmed by a trio of college students. There was actual shrieking. When I observed to Warren that she has fangirls, she replied, ''I know,'' with a self-assuredness that female candidates have often found difficult to convey.
''It makes me feel very responsible,'' she said as she watched the young women disappear into the night. ''Very excited, but very responsible.''
Among other things, what Warren offers is a reasonable, expert face for the free-floating anger currently on display at Occupy Wall Street and elsewhere. She can get wonky about the economy when she wants to, but what sets her apart is her ability to tell a coherent, populist story about it in a way that other members of her party are either unwilling or unable to do.
She has had plenty of practice talking about these issues. When she was a bankruptcy-law scholar, Warren spent decades interviewing not only judges and lawyers but also people filing for bankruptcy. In the process, she upended the assumption that Americans who were going broke were merely irresponsible overspenders. She and her two collaborators (Jay Lawrence Westbrook and Teresa A. Sullivan) argued, long before the collapse of the banks and the mortgage crisis, that years of deregulation left an American economy so fragile that families could be pushed into bankruptcy by a single factor, like job loss, divorce or illness.
It also helps that Warren has never run for office before. Like Obama in '08, she's a blank screen onto which admirers can project whatever they most want to see. Over the course of her career, Warren has been able to advocate for struggling people without actually having to work for/-- and thus inevitably disappoint -- them. What her admirers on the left see is a woman who rises above everything wormy in Washington, including indiscriminate partisan loyalty. As chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel monitoring TARP, Warren barbecued not just Bush's Treasury chief, Hank Paulson, but also Obama's appointee, Tim Geithner. In public hearings in 2010, she pressed Geithner on the banking system's exposure to bad commercial loans and failures with the home-mortgage-foreclosure program. A believer in a regulated market who used to be a Republican, Warren refused to tell me whether she voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980, remarking that even her husband of 30 years, ''doesn't know who I voted for, and he sleeps with me.''
Temperamentally, Warren presents as the opposite of certain bombastic and arguably chauvinistic members of Obama's economic team. Katherine Porter, a former student who is now a bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said that ''a strong epithet for Elizabeth is 'golly gee.' '' Warren told me of an afternoon, about 10 years ago, when she picked up her office phone and was shocked to hear a man cursing on the other end. ''I thought, Whew! My first obscene phone call!'' Just before hanging up, Warren paused. The accent sounded familiar. She put the receiver back to her ear, waiting for the speaker to take a breath before asking, ''Senator Kennedy?'' It was indeed the man whose old seat she is now competing for, phoning from the Senate cloakroom to report that Democrats had unexpectedly won a fight over bankruptcy legislation. ''He was so revved up!'' Warren said.
But the expectation that she's Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle also allows Warren to wield a shiv. Carol Kenner, a retired bankruptcy judge, recalled watching her friend Warren, who went to college on a debate scholarship, fiercely engage another legal scholar who was attacking her. ''It's exercise for her,'' Kenner said, ''like swimming a faster lap.''
While fighting for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Warren told The Huffington Post that if she didn't wind up with a strong consumer agency, her second choice would be ''no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor,'' a phrase that has already been overlaid on images of Wall Street protesters in a Republican attack ad. Questioned at the time on CNBC about words that sounded ''unnecessarily aggressive,'' Warren replied: ''Gee, I don't know. That doesn't seem aggressive at all to me.''
Warren's fierceness in the land of suits has earned her plenty of enemies, but it has also mobilized a demographic yearning for a candidate to call its own. Congress remains only 16 percent female, and Massachusetts has an especially long and rotten history of women in politics. Since Puritans settled there in the early 17th century, more Massachusetts women have been hanged in the Salem witch trials (14) than have been elected to the House of Representatives (4), the Senate (0) or the governor's mansion (0, though Jane Swift served as acting governor from 2001 to 2003). Backed by politically engaged women most recently frustrated by the lackluster campaign of Martha Coakley, who lost disastrously to Scott Brown in 2010, Warren is very likely to benefit from four centuries worth of pent-up energy.
The cost of that energy is that she will be asked to live up to a fantasy that has plagued other history-makers: that by virtue of being different from those who preceded her, she will govern differently.
''If you look at countries that have elected women presidents,'' Barbara Lee told me, ''very often, they've elected a woman when things were so bad they gave the woman a chance.'' I suggested that the instance in which power is handed over only when it becomes so gnarled that it ceases to be any kind of power at all is a grim victory.
Lee nodded. ''Whatever it takes,'' she replied.
The question of what it would take for Warren to maneuver through the Senate is particularly prickly given that Warren's aims sound as outsize, and perhaps as naive, as the expectations of her followers.
''I don't want to go to Washington to be a co-sponsor of some bland, little bill nobody cares about,'' she told me. ''I don't want to go to Washington to get my name on something that makes small change at the margin.'' Responding to my suggestion that she must run a grass-roots campaign in part because she won't have support from banks, Warren said: ''That's absolutely true if you think the objective is to win. For me, it's about more than that.''
And those last words, which edge into cliche, provide a hint of the central tension she'll face over the next year. She has derived her strength from the candor and specificity of her speech, but that strength is sapped as soon as she starts dealing in the anodyne language of political campaigns. In the past, Warren has been clear that she doesn't take to being reined in. At the start of a lecture she gave at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2010, while she was setting up the C.F.P.B., she groused about living ''in a world in which someone has to read my speech in advance.'' Twenty minutes later, she went off-script, complaining, ''I hate being tied to something; I feel like this is a boring speech.''
She insists that regulation of her words is less of a problem now that she's a candidate, technically answering to voters and not to the federal government. But asked by phone if her communications team felt anxiety about her perceived liberty on this account, she replied, ''Oh, they're anxious, you bet,'' and joked that she could hear her campaign spokesman ''on the other end of this call, breathing heavily.''
You can see the transformation happening already. When pressed on what kind of formidable legislation she would actually pursue in the Senate, Warren's organization served up a snoozy list of the priorities that Democrats have been talking about for years: she will push for spending on infrastructure, education and renewable energy. She will work to strengthen labor unions and advocate for the reregulation of the big banks while easing regulations that make it difficult for small businesses and community banks to compete with giants.
These are fine notions; there's a reason they've long been the mainstays of an imagined liberal revolution. But they're also the ideas that cause Congress to immediately grind to a halt and that, when packaged in nonspecific campaign-speak, are quickly drained of meaning.
Warren's stated commitment to going out on her shield also sets her up for charges of inconsistency or hypocrisy. Already Warren has been nudged for accepting PAC money; for hiring a lobbyist, Doug Rubin, to advise her campaign; and for accepting a $1,000 donation from a General Electric lobbyist. Recently, the right has made hay of her half-million-dollar-a-year income, presenting the illogical but perhaps resonant argument that a wealthy person fighting for less wealthy people must be a false prophet.
Some critics also argue that Warren will need to recalibrate her message so that it is less about the terrible things that have befallen the middle class and more about how voters can empower themselves. ''The danger of her campaign is that it is predicated on the notion that people are victims,'' says Jim Kessler, a senior vice president for policy at Third Way and former policy director for Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. ''If her entire campaign is about how people need to be rescued from powerful forces around them, I think it will be more limited in its appeal than what it could be.'' Kessler adds that he nonetheless believes that Warren will prevail.
How to sell hope when so many feel hopeless is Warren's biggest messaging challenge. Her supporters may be willing to forget the past four years and renew their faith in her as their next salvation, but Warren clearly thinks about the dissonance of what happened when the last change-peddlers hit Washington.
''I thought, 2008, that's it, that is the watershed moment,'' Warren says. ''We put sensible people in the House, in the Senate and in the White House.'' But even with the new leadership, Warren said, ''the people who broke the market doubled down on the failed policies. This was not supposed to happen. But it did happen.''
Warren described how, in her work for the C.F.P.B., she was flabbergasted by the ''phalanxes'' of lobbyists who forced her to move aside in Congressional hallways; by how, after a meeting, she might head back to her office to look up figures while lobbyists would ''get on cellphones to an army of well-trained lawyers preparing to do a customized memo.''
Warren's frankness about the forces lined up against the current administration gets muddied when she talks about what she herself would be up against. In fact, one of her chief psychological strategies seems to be turning a blind eye to depressing realities. She told me of how, while working in Washington, reports said ''there were now a zillion lobbyists for every single member of Congress.'' Warren said, ''I just had to look away, because no reasonable person would have kept on fighting at that point.'' When I suggested that should she become a senator, her office would also be overrun with lobbyists, she laughed as if the thought were preposterous. ''Mmm, that will be fun,'' she said. ''I just want to savor that image.''
But the lobbyists will be there. Zillions of them. And while Warren may see through their customized memos, that doesn't mean she won't burn hours engaging with lobbyists or that she won't be forced to cut deals with them.
''As a friend of hers, I worry about whether it's the highest or best use of an extraordinary person's capabilities to be in the United States Senate,'' says Rob Johnson, a former economist for the Senate Banking Committee. He added that he doesn't question Warren's integrity, ''but with regard to anyone's capacity to be functional in Washington, it's a long shot in the other direction.''
If Washington were a place where one brave politician is able to triumph, Warren wouldn't be running for the Senate at all; she'd be running the consumer-protection agency she created. But Obama didn't even nominate her for the position. Perhaps he didn't want to have the fight with Republicans determined to block her; perhaps he was worn down by those on his own team who didn't mesh with Warren or by Democrats like Chris Dodd, who suggested publicly that she lacked the managerial experience to run the agency. But that's the point: Warren is headed toward a legislative body that will most likely wear her down, too. She will be pushing her attempts at substantive change right up against the same Republicans whose very existence cowed a president, in a Senate that now requires 60 votes to pass a greeting card.
And it's not just Republicans who won't be lining up alongside Warren. There are Democrats who talk a good game on financial reform but remain deeply and firmly beholden to banks. Members of her own party may hate Warren more than her ideological opponents, because if in fact she is as uncompromised as her acolytes think her to be, she is going to make them look bad.
Tim Geithner was rumored to have opposed Warren's appointment to head the C.F.P.B. after the public scrutiny she subjected him to, while Democrats like Dodd found ways to discredit Warren without publicly assailing her vision of an economically just America. Criticism of Warren has already included gender-inflected barbs designed to diminish her, like anonymous leaks out of the Treasury Department about how Warren focused more on media appearances and repainting her office than on setting up an agency.
Warren described her motivation to enter politics by recalling the time Barney Frank called her to the Capitol during the first days of writing the latest financial-regulation bill. Warren didn't understand much about the process but observed as representatives argued about individual issues until Frank asked, ''Can everybody live with that?'' When he was met with nods, he said, ''Done!'' and aides wrote down the agreed-upon language. Warren watched the process several times before Frank asked if anyone had anything else to add.
''I said, 'What about credit-reporting agencies?' '' Warren said, noting that the bill should include monitoring to make sure those companies engaged in fair practices. ''Barney looks around the room and says, 'Anybody got a problem with that?' And they say, 'No,' and he says 'Done!' and everybody writes it down. I thought, Whooaah.'' Credit-reporting jurisdiction was added to the bill. ''That was the first time,'' she said, ''that I understood -- and real well -- what it means to be in the room.''
Having the right person in the room can mean something. It just doesn't change everything.
It's not that Warren's supporters shouldn't get lathered up about her. Staid appreciation for competent candidates has never made ballot boxes burst, and political dedication by its nature requires a degree of magical thinking: a privileging of optimism over lived experience.
But many of the people looking to Warren, as they did to Obama before her, are expecting material things -- like readable credit-card pitches or safe bridges or jobs or a vote on a bill to create jobs -- that are, at the moment, figments as imaginative as dragons and their slayers. And that's dangerous, because when the person we decided was going to fix it all isn't able to change much, it's not just that we get blue but also that we give up. We mistake the errors of our own overblown estimations for broken promises. And instead of learning, reasonably, that one person can't do everything, we persuade ourselves that no person can do anything.
The key is not just emotional investment in election-year saviors but also an engagement with policy. A commitment to organized expressions of political desire -- like those that have been harnessed so effectively in recent years on the right -- have been absent for far too long in Democratic politics. Now, with labor protests, campaigns to block voter suppression and personhood measures and the occupations of cities around the nation, there seem to be some small signs that liberals are remembering that politics requires more of them, that they need movements, not just messiahs. But their engagement must deepen, broaden and persist beyond last week's elections and well beyond next year's elections if there is any chance for politicians like Warren to succeed.
Because while she might provide her supporters and her constituents a voice that, if properly tuned, will rattle doors that are now gummed shut, what Elizabeth Warren cannot do is fix this mess herself.

HEADLINE: President Obama in Asia

 BODY:
Early in his term, President Obama was too deferential to China. On his Asia trip last week, he sent a clear message that this country is not ceding anything in the Pacific. That is good news. 
Like President George W. Bush, Mr. Obama's preference is to engage Beijing in international organizations and agreements in hopes that will encourage China's leaders to behave more responsibly. It is a sound long-range strategy. But China has made clear that without serious and sustained push-back, it will use its economic and military clout to bully and intimidate its neighbors.
The most brazen example is its broad claim to energy reserves in the South China Sea that are also claimed by five other countries. On Friday, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, said at an Asian summit meeting that ''outside forces'' had no right to get involved in the dispute.
On his trip, Mr. Obama insisted he would ''seek more opportunities for cooperation with Beijing.'' But he also made clear that his patience has limits, at one point saying that China has now ''grown up'' and should act responsibly in its trade and currency practices.
In Australia, he announced an agreement to deploy 2,500 Marines plus naval ships and aircraft to a base in Darwin starting next year. That is not a huge number, but it is a pointed symbol of America's interest.
At the same time, we were concerned by Mr. Obama's declaration to Australia's Parliament that budget reductions ''will not -- I repeat, will not -- come at the expense of the Asia-Pacific.'' Allies, of course, need to hear that. But any new mission in Asia cannot become another excuse for Pentagon planners to avoid making needed cuts.
On his trip, the president also rightly championed the benefits of freer trade -- a position made more credible after Congress finally passed the trade deal with South Korea. His push to negotiate a trade deal with eight other Pacific Rim countries is important. He must keep reminding Beijing that it is welcome to join if it makes the necessary economic reforms.
What the United States should not do is overreach. Beijing already suspects that the real American goal is to ''contain'' its power. Washington must be transparent about its dealings and consult and include China when possible. American and Chinese political leaders have a regular dialogue. The Pentagon needs to do more to cultivate relationships with its resistant counterparts.
Dealing with a rising China requires a deft hand and a willingness to push back when Beijing oversteps. Being there is a big part of it.

HEADLINE: What They Don't Teach Law Students: Lawyering

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- The lesson today -- the ins and outs of closing a deal -- seems lifted from Corporate Lawyering 101.
''How do you get a merger done?'' asks Scott B. Connolly, an attorney.
There is silence from three well-dressed people in their early 20s, sitting at a conference table in a downtown building here last month.
''What steps would you need to take to accomplish a merger?'' Mr. Connolly prods.
After a pause, a participant gives it a shot: ''You buy all the stock of one company. Is that what you need?'' 
''That's a stock acquisition,'' Mr. Connolly says. ''The question is, when you close a merger, how does that deal get done?''
The answer -- draft a certificate of merger and file it with the secretary of state -- is part of a crash course in legal training. But the three people taking notes are not students. They are associates at a law firm called Drinker Biddle & Reath, hired to handle corporate transactions. And they have each spent three years and as much as $150,000 for a legal degree.
What they did not get, for all that time and money, was much practical training. Law schools have long emphasized the theoretical over the useful, with classes that are often overstuffed with antiquated distinctions, like the variety of property law in post-feudal England. Professors are rewarded for chin-stroking scholarship, like law review articles with titles like ''A Future Foretold: Neo-Aristotelian Praise of Postmodern Legal Theory.''
So, for decades, clients have essentially underwritten the training of new lawyers, paying as much as $300 an hour for the time of associates learning on the job. But the downturn in the economy, and long-running efforts to rethink legal fees, have prompted more and more of those clients to send a simple message to law firms: Teach new hires on your own dime.
''The fundamental issue is that law schools are producing people who are not capable of being counselors,'' says Jeffrey W. Carr, the general counsel of FMC Technologies, a Houston company that makes oil drilling equipment. ''They are lawyers in the sense that they have law degrees, but they aren't ready to be a provider of services.''
Last year, a survey by American Lawyer found that 47 percent of law firms had a client say, in effect, ''We don't want to see the names of first- or second-year associates on our bills.'' Other clients are demanding that law firms charge flat fees.
This has helped to hasten a historic decline in hiring. The legal services market has shrunk for three consecutive years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Altogether, the top 250 firms -- which hired 27 percent of graduates from the top 50 law schools last year -- have lost nearly 10,000 jobs since 2008, according to an April survey by The National Law Journal.
Law schools know all about the tough conditions that await graduates, and many have added or expanded programs that provide practical training through legal clinics. But almost all the cachet in legal academia goes to professors who produce law review articles, which gobbles up huge amounts of time and tuition money. The essential how-tos of daily practice are a subject that many in the faculty know nothing about -- by design. One 2010 study of hiring at top-tier law schools since 2000 found that the median amount of practical experience was one year, and that nearly half of faculty members had never practiced law for a single day. If medical schools took the same approach, they'd be filled with professors who had never set foot in a hospital.
But sticking to the old syllabus has had little downside. The clients of law firms may be scaling back, but the clients of law schools -- namely, students -- are spending freely. Or rather, borrowing heavily. It is hard to imagine a 21-year-old without a steady income securing a private or federally guaranteed loan to buy a $150,000 house, but sums like that are still readily available for just about anyone who wants a doctor of jurisprudence degree. And while word of grievous job prospects is finally reaching undergraduates -- there was an a 11.5 percent drop in applications this year -- there were no empty seats in any of the 200 law schools in the country.
''I gather change is afoot at some law schools,'' Mr. Connolly says, ''but it's going to be very slow.''
So at Drinker Biddle, first-year associates spend four months getting a primer on corporate law. During this time, they work at a reduced salary and they are neither expected nor allowed to bill a client. It's good marketing for the firm and a novel experience for the trainees.
''What they taught us at this law firm is how to be a lawyer,'' says Dennis P. O'Reilly, who went through the program last year, and attended the George Washington University School of Law. ''What they taught us at law school is how to graduate from law school.''
Allergic to the Practical
Law schools' aversion to all things vocational has been much debated, both inside and outside the academy. But critics are fighting both tradition and the legal academy's peculiar set of neuroses.
''Law school has a kind of intellectual inferiority complex, and it's built into the idea of law school itself,'' says W. Bradley Wendel of the Cornell University Law School, a professor who has written about landing a law school teaching job. ''People who teach at law school are part of a profession and part of a university. So we're always worried that other parts of the academy are going to look down on us and say: 'You're just a trade school, like those schools that advertise on late-night TV. You don't write dissertations. You don't write articles that nobody reads.' And the response of law school professors is to say: 'That's not true. We do all of that. We're scholars, just like you.' ''
This trade-school anxiety can be traced back to the mid-19th century, when legal training was mostly technical and often taught in rented rooms that were unattached to institutions of higher education.
A lawyer named Christopher Langdell changed that when he was appointed dean of the Harvard Law School in 1870 and began to rebrand legal education. Mr. Langdell introduced ''case method,'' which is the short answer to the question ''What does law school teach you if not how to be a lawyer?'' This approach cultivates a student's capacity to reason and all but ignores the particulars of practice.
Consider, for instance, Contracts, a first-year staple. It is one of many that originated in the Langdell era and endures today. In it, students will typically encounter such classics as Hadley v. Baxendale, an 1854 dispute about financial damages caused by the late delivery of a crankshaft to a British miller.
Here is what students will rarely encounter in Contracts: actual contracts, the sort that lawyers need to draft and file. Likewise, Criminal Law class is normally filled with case studies about common law crimes -- like murder and theft -- but hardly mentions plea bargaining, even though a vast majority of criminal cases are resolved by that method.
Defenders of the status quo say that law school is the wrong place to teach legal practice because law is divided into countless niches and that mastering any of them can take years. This sort of instruction, they say, can be taught only in the context of an apprenticeship. And if newcomers in medicine, finance and other fields are trained, in large part, by their employers, why shouldn't the same be true in law?
But those pushing for more practical content aren't looking for a bunch of classes in legal minutiae, nor do they expect client-ready lawyers to march off their campus. Instead, they would like to see less bias against professional training and more classes that engage the law as it exists today.
''We should be teaching what is really going on in the legal system,'' says Edward L. Rubin, a professor and former dean at the Vanderbilt Law School, ''not what was going on in the 1870s, when much of the legal curriculum was put in place.''
During his tenure as dean, which began in 2005, Professor Rubin tried to update some of the school's mandatory classes. First, he held a series of focus-group discussions, meeting with law firms to find out what managing partners wished that their new hires had already been taught.
Eventually, these conversations led to a new first-year class, the Regulatory State, an introduction to federal administrative agencies, statutes and regulations. Vanderbilt also made changes to second- and third-year courses.
But there were limits. Professor Rubin failed to sell his faculty members on a retooled first-year Contracts class.
''Some members of the faculty got a little overstressed by all the change,'' Professor Rubin says. ''Planning a new course, you have to move out of your comfort zone a little in terms of teaching. And there is always the fear that your school will wind up being seen as an oddball place.''
Another problem he encountered: there are few incentives for law professors to excel at teaching. It might earn them the admiration of students, but it won't win them any professional goodies, like tenure, a higher salary, prestige or competing offers from better schools. For those, a professor must publish law review articles, the ticket to punch for any upwardly mobile scholar.
There are more than 600 law reviews in the United States -- Georgetown alone produces 11 -- and they publish about 10,000 articles a year. Some of these articles are worthwhile and influential, and the best are cited by lawyers in arguments and by judges in court decisions. A study to be published in The Northwestern University Law Review found that in the last 61 years, the Supreme Court ''has used legal scholarship'' in about one-third of its decisions.
But citable law review articles are vastly outnumbered, it appears, by head-scratchers. ''There is evidence that law review articles have left terra firma to soar into outer space,'' said the Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer in a 2008 speech.
Some articles are intra-academy tiffs that could interest only the combatants (like ''What Is Wrong With Kamm's and Scanlon's Arguments Against Taurek'' from The Journal of Ethics & Social Philosophy). Others fall under the category of highbrow edu-tainment, like a 2006 article in The Cardozo Law Review about the legal taboos of a well-known obscenity, the one-word title of which is unprintable in a family newspaper.
Still others crossbreed law and some other discipline, a variety of scholarship that seems to especially irk John G. Roberts Jr., chief justice of the United States. ''Pick up a copy of any law review that you see,'' he said at a conference this summer, ''and the first article is likely to be, you know, the influence of Immanuel Kant on evidentiary approaches in 18th-century Bulgaria, or something, which I'm sure was of great interest to the academic that wrote it, but isn't of much help to the bar.''
In fact, many of these articles are not of much apparent help to anyone. A 2005 law review article found that around 40 percent of law review articles in the LexisNexis database had never been cited in cases or in other law review articles.
Of course, much of academia produces cryptic, narrowly cast and unread scholarship. But a pie chart of how law school tuition is actually spent would show an enormous slice for research and writing of law review articles.
How enormous? Last year, J.D., or juris doctor, students spent about $3.6 billion on tuition, according to American Bar Association figures, accounting for discounts through merit- and need-based aid. Given that about half of a law school's budget is spent on faculty salary and benefits, and that tenure-track faculty members consume about 80 percent of the faculty budget -- and that such professors spend about 40 percent of their time producing scholarship -- roughly one-sixth of that $3.6 billion subsidized faculty scholarship. That's more than $575 million.
Much of that comes from taxpayers in the form of federal student loans. Steven R. Smith, dean of the California Western School of Law, described this sum as ''the equivalent of an involuntary fee'' that students must pay to get a diploma. ''It is not obvious that students are the ones who should be paying the cost of legal scholarship. They are generally borrowing the money to do this and they are the least able of all those in the profession to pay for it.''
The Prestige Game
About half of all law school hiring begins at the Faculty Recruitment Conference, widely known as the meat market, held by the Association of American Law Schools. It is conducted every year at the Marriott in the Woodley Park neighborhood of Washington.
At this year's conference, in October, nearly 500 aspiring law professors turned up for interviews with 165 law schools. Like the draft of every professional sport, there are superstars here and for two days they were hotly pursued. At the top of the pile were former Supreme Court clerks. Just under them were candidates with both a J.D. and a Ph.D. in another discipline. Law schools, especially those in the upper echelons, have been smitten by Ph.D.-J.D.'s for more than a decade.
Ori J. Herstein, who studied philosophy in grad school and is a doctor in the science of law, says that ''an economics Ph.D. is the most valuable,'' and that ''the further away you get from the humanities the better.''
Mr. Herstein was sitting in the Marriott lobby between interviews. Israeli-born and cheerful in a boyishly wonky way, he has a resume that seems custom-built to tantalize law school recruiters. He has two degrees from Columbia, which, along with a handful of other elite schools -- most notably Yale -- has become a farm team for the credential-obsessed legal academy. He has already published a handful of law review articles with promisingly esoteric titles (''Historic Injustice and the Non-Identity Problem: The Limitations of the Subsequent-Wrong Solution and Towards a New Solution'') and has submitted another that sounds perfectly inscrutable (''Why Nonexistent People Do Not Have Zero Well-Being but Rather No Well-Being'').
This type of scholarship, and the cash that keeps the law review conveyor belt spinning, are defended by law school professors as a way to attract the best and brightest to teaching. It is also said to enhance the prestige and sophistication of the American legal system. ''Students want renowned scholars to teach them, period,'' said Francis J. Mootz III, a professor at the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada and the author of ''Neo-Aristotelian Praise of Postmodern Legal Theory. ''They want to learn from the best and brightest.''
It is true that a law school's reputation, and the value of its diplomas in the legal market, are almost entirely bound up in the amount and quality of the scholarship it produces. That's been especially so since the late '80s, when U.S. News and World Report started to rank law schools. The publisher's annual rankings all but define a school's standing in the legal academy's firmament, and 40 percent of the U.S. News algorithm is based on a ''quality assessment'' survey by hundreds of lawyers, judges, deans and professors.
The problem is that with rare exceptions, all schools play the same scholarship-and-prestige game. Even professors in the lowest rungs churn out scholarship, and one of the first items of business for new schools is starting a law review. The result is a kind of arms race, with articles playing the role of nukes and students paying the bill.
Experience Unnecessary
Another appeal of Ori Herstein's resume is what it's missing: many years of toiling in a law firm. It is widely believed that after lawyers have spent more than eight or nine years practicing, their chances of getting a tenure-track job at law school start to dwindle.
''Nobody wants to become a retirement home, or a place for washed-out lawyers,'' says Kevin R. Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California, Davis, who came to the meat market with six positions to fill.
This might seem a paradox -- experienced people need not apply -- but the academy views seasoned pros with a certain suspicion. In fact, a number of veterans of legal practice who failed to land tenure-track jobs say that experience was a stigma they could not beat.
''It can be fatal, because the academy wants people who are not sullied by the practice of law,'' said a longtime lawyer and adjunct professor, who did not want to be identified because his remarks might alienate colleagues. ''A lot of people who are good at big ideas, the people who teach at law school, think it is beneath them.''
The exceptions are those who teach legal clinics, which are programs where students learn to counsel clients (usually poor), draft documents and even litigate, all under faculty supervision. Legal clinics are a growing presence on nearly every campus, and many -- like Washington University's Law School in St. Louis and the CUNY School of Law in Queens -- get high marks for quality and participation.
But a lot of these programs struggle with a kind of second-class status. Many are staffed, in whole or in part, by teachers who are not voting members of the faculty, and the programs are often modest. A soon-to-be released study of clinical programs by the Center for the Study of Applied Legal Education found that only 3 percent of law schools required clinical training.
''There has been an explosion in interest in clinical law programs,'' says David Santacroce, president of the center, ''but the growth parallels an explosion in the total number of law students so we haven't reached anything close to the saturation point yet. The majority of law students still graduate without any clinical experience.''
While most of law schools' professoriate still happily dwell in the uppermost floors of the ivory tower, the view from the ground for new graduates is growing uglier. It's not just that the market is now awash with castoffs from Big Law, and that clients can now retain graduates from elite schools and pay them $25 or $50 an hour, on contract. The nature of legal work itself is evolving, and the days when corporations buy billable hours, instead of results, are numbered.
To succeed in this environment, graduates will need entrepreneurial skills, management ability and some expertise in landing clients. They will need to know less about Contracts and more about contracts.
''Where do these students go?'' says Michael Roster, a former chairman of the Association of Corporate Counsel and a lecturer at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. ''There are virtually no openings. They can't hang a shingle and start on their own. Many of them are now asking their schools, 'Why didn't you teach me how to practice law?' ''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about the emphasis on theoretical over practical learning in law schools misidentified a first-year course about common law crimes. It is Criminal Law, not Criminal Procedure.

 BODY:
Amwell Township is a 44-square-mile plot of steep ravines and grassy pasturelands planted with alfalfa, trefoil and timothy in the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania. It's home to some 4,000 people, most of whom live in villages named Amity, Lone Pine and Prosperity.
From some views, this diamond-shaped cut of land looks like the hardscrabble farmland it has been since the 18th century, when English and Scottish settlers successfully drove away the members of a Native American village called Annawanna, or ''the path of the water.'' Arrowheads still line the streambeds. Hickory trees march out along its high, dry ridges. Box elders ring the lower, wetter gullies. The air smells of sweet grass. Cows moo. Horses whinny.
From other vantages, it looks like an American natural-gas field, home to 10 gas wells, a compressor station -- which feeds fresh gas into pipelines leading to homes hundreds of miles away -- and what was, until late this summer, an open five-acre water-impoundment chemical pond. Trucks rev engines over fresh earth. Backhoes grind stubborn stones. Pipeline snakes beneath clear-cut hillsides. 
The township sits atop the Marcellus Shale Deposit, one of the largest fields of natural gas in the world, a formation that stretches beneath 575 miles of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York. Shale gas, even its fiercest critics concede, presents an opportunity for the United States to be less dependent on foreign oil. According to Wood Mackenzie, an energy-consulting firm, the Marcellus formation will supply 6 percent of America's gas this year, a figure expected to more than double by 2020.
About five years ago, leases began to appear in the mailboxes of residents of Amwell Township from Range Resources, a Texas-based oil company seeking to harvest gas through hydraulic fracturing. ''Fracking,'' as it is known, is a process of natural-gas drilling that involves pumping vast quantities of water, sand and chemicals thousands of feet into the earth to crack the deep shale deposits and free bubbles of gas from the ancient, porous rock. Harvesting this gas promises either to provide Americans with a clean domestic energy source or to despoil rural areas and poison our air and drinking water, depending on whom you ask.
On Nov. 21, the Delaware River Basin Commission, which involves four states -- Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware -- will vote on rules governing fracking in the river's watershed, which supplies some 15 million people with drinking water. The states most affected will be New York and Pennsylvania, which sit on the Marcellus Shale, where the gas is closest to the surface.
This summer, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York moved to lift the state's yearlong moratorium on fracking against vocal opposition from environmentalists and many local residents. Following a series of hearings this month, New York will decide whether to allow fracking early next year. In the meantime, New Yorkers are looking to Pennsylvania, the first neighbor to welcome fracking, as a model.
There are more than 4,000 Marcellus wells in Pennsylvania, with projections ranging from 2,500 new wells a year to a total of more than 100,000 over the next few decades; 458 of those wells are in Washington County and 60 are in Amwell Township, to which fracking has given an injection of new income and business; it has also spurred one of the first E.P.A. investigations into fracking's effects on rivers, streams, drinking water and human health.
Just before Christmas in 2008, a handful of neighbors granted Range Resources the right to drill thousands of feet below their homes and up to two miles in any direction. Signing leases here is nothing new. For the past 200 years, one industry after another has extracted minerals from the land. In the 1800s, it was coal; in the 1900s it was glass, coke and steel and industrial mining. ''Sooner or later, somebody wants to go around, under or through you,'' one farmer and gun-shop proprietor told me. ''You make your best deal and you talk to a lawyer. At least these companies pay something up front.''
What these companies paid was more than many people in Amwell Township, where the per capita income in the 2000 census was $18,285, were accustomed to seeing in their lifetimes, even if the windfall wasn't the same for everyone. Next-door neighbors made, upon signing, between $1,500 and more than $500,000 for the same amount of land. Curiously enough, the huge gap in payments didn't cause much trouble among neighbors, at least at first. Most, if they express a political viewpoint at all, are old-school libertarians who believe each man has the right to live by his will and abilities.
The conflict instead is between ''country folk and city people,'' Bill Hartley, 63, a barber and a cattle farmer told me. ''The country folk want the drilling and have mineral rights. The city folk don't want the drilling and have no rights to sell.''
At Hartley's Styling Shop, the barbershop Hartley has run out of a rented trailer on his great-great-grandfather's farm for the past 16 years, the gas boom is all anyone talks about. There's a barber pole spinning outside and a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. A John Deere clock tells time according to a tractor. When I met Hartley there early last spring, he was alone, reclining in his barber's chair and chain-smoking, as he had been for hours, or maybe years. The trailer's air and Naugahyde chairs were saturated with stale smoke.
''Do you mind if I smoke?'' he asked. I didn't. ''Good, because I would have told you, 'Tough.' '' Hartley, who has the long, hollow face of an Appalachian Marlboro Man, keeps 35 cows on 110 acres of rocky fields of fescue. Until recently, like most farmers he knows, he needed a second job to pay for the cows. Raising cows costs more than $300 a head per year. It takes a good year for Hartley to break even. Now he has more money than he ever imagined. Signing his gas lease at ''a little more'' than $1,000 an acre netted him in excess of $110,000 upon signing, plus 12.5 percent of the royalties from gas produced on his land. Hartley prefers not to discuss exact amounts. ''That's nobody's business,'' he said. But after the first couple of years, production tends to drop off precipitously, and the royalty checks will dwindle. So Hartley still cuts hair. ''And I like people,'' he said.
As Hartley sees it, the gas industry has helped him to preserve his farm, cows and way of life. ''I don't want to say you have to be born into it,'' he said. ''But it has to be in your blood.''
The Marcellus boom has brought a host of economic benefits to Western Pennsylvania -- new jobs, booked motel rooms, busy food franchises and newly paved roads -- and promises to bring more. According to a recent study by Pennsylvania State University, the industry has created 23,000 jobs, including employment for roustabouts, construction workers, helicopter pilots, sign makers, Laundromat workers, electricians, caterers, chambermaids, office workers, water haulers and land surveyors. Not to mention that leaseholders are saving, on average, 55 percent of the money they make upon signing leases and 66 percent of their royalties, according to the Pennsylvania State University study.
Hartley's cousin Stacey Haney lives two and a half miles from Hartley's farm. A brown-haired, blue-eyed former beautician, Haney, 42, is a nurse at the nearby Washington Hospital. Hartley and Haney share a kind of tough self-reliance, as well as a quick, dark wit.
''We came into this world poor, and we'll go out of this world poor,'' Haney says. This is her family's motto. Haney -- a single mother who wears her hair in a shag -- works full time and is raising her two children, Paige, 12, and Harley, 15, along with an ark of 4-H animals. Her father, Larry, whom everyone calls Pappy, is a steelworker. He has had long stints of unemployment, beginning when Stacey was in second grade. He's also a sometime farmer whose butternuts have won first place so often at the Washington County Fair that no one else bothers to enter anymore. The fair is the highlight of the Haneys' year: beribboned photos of their award-winning rabbits, goats and pigs line the walls of their immaculate three-bedroom home, which Haney has hand-stenciled with deer tracks.
When the natural-gas industry came to town, Haney saw an opportunity to pay off farm bills and make a profit from the land. Word had it that the companies were interested in signing up large parcels, so in the winter of 2008, Haney, who owned only eight acres, persuaded two of her neighbors to pool their land on a lease for which she was paid, in installments, $1,000 dollars per acre and 15 percent royalties.
The money would help to pay the taxes on their farms. The land man who came to the Haney home to sell the lease showed pictures of a farm and pasture with a well cap ''the size of a garbage can,'' Haney said, which she found reassuring. And it didn't seem as if the drilling would affect their lives much. Range Resources was involved in the community in small ways too. For the past several years, it operated a booth at the Washington County Fair. In 2010, the company offered kids an extra $100 for the farm animals they auctioned. That was the year Stacey Haney's son, Harley, took his breeding goat, Boots, all the way to grand champion.
At the fair, Haney ran into her next-door neighbor, Beth Voyles, 54, a horse trainer and dog breeder, who signed the lease with Haney in 2008. She told Haney that her 11 /2-year-old boxer, Cummins, had just died. Voyles thought that he was poisoned. She saw the dog drinking repeatedly from a puddle of road runoff, and she thought that the water the gas company used to wet down the roads probably had antifreeze in it. ''We do not use ethylene glycol in the fracking process,'' Matt Pitzarella of Range Resources told me. He also said that the dog's veterinarian couldn't confirm the dog had been poisoned and that another possible cause of death was cancer.
A month later, Haney's dog, Hunter, also died suddenly. Soon after, Voyles called Haney to tell her that her barrel horse, Jody, was dead. Lab results revealed a high level of toxicity in her liver. Voyles sent her animals' test results to Range Resources. In response, Range Resources wrote to Voyles to say that, as the veterinarian indicated, the horse died of toxicity of the liver, not antifreeze poisoning. The company did acknowledge that the vet suspected the horse died of poisoning by heavy metals. Subsequent tests of the Voyleses' water supply by Range Resources revealed no heavy metals.
Voyles's boxers began to abort litters of puppies; six were born with cleft palates. They died within hours. Others were born dead or without legs or hair. Unsure what to do, Voyles stored 15 of the puppies in her freezer. (Range Resources says it was never notified about the puppies.) By December, Boots, the grand-champion goat, aborted two babies. Haney had to put her down the day after Christmas.
What was going on with the animals? Where were the toxic chemicals in their blood coming from? Haney feared that the arrival of the gas industry and the drilling that had begun less than 1,000 feet from her home might have something to do with it.
In Amwell Township, your opinion of fracking tends to correspond with how much money you're making and with how close you live to the gas wells, chemical ponds, pipelines and compressor stations springing up in the area. Many of those who live nearby fear that a leak in the plastic liner of a chemical pond could drip into a watershed or that a truck spill could send carcinogens into a field of beef cattle. (According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 65 Marcellus wells drilled this year have been cited for faulty cement casings, which could result in leaks.) But for many other residents, including Haney's neighbors, the risks seem small, and the benefits -- clean fuel, economic development -- far outweigh them.
On a Saturday morning in July 2011, Bill Hartley's Styling Shop bustled with clients -- a truck driver, a leaseholder, a landowner -- all of whom profited from the gas boom. One was Ray Day, 64, a ginger-haired farmer, who, along with his brothers and sisters, owns nearly 300 acres of Amwell Township. Thanks to the money he received from allowing Range Resources to drill, build a compressor station and dig a chemical pond on his land, he has been able to reroof two barns, buy a new hay baler and construct an addition to his house for his 94-year-old mother. ''I only buy something if I can pay cash,'' Day said later. And he still has plenty of money left over. Was he planning a vacation, maybe to Florida? Day snorted good-naturedly. ''Farmers don't go to Florida,'' he said.
A few days later, I met up with Day off 1-79 at the Amity-Lone Pine exit, a little more than a mile from Stacey Haney's home, and followed him past the local elementary school to a barn, with a white wooden sign that said Day Farm 1912. We drove a few thousand yards up a steep hill to a gated compound, where we were met by a young woman who'd come from West Virginia, along with her husband, a driller, to work as a security guard for Range Resources. She called headquarters to confirm my permission to visit. As we waited, Day pointed out a 40-by-100 fabric hoop structure where he stores round bales of hay. During the hydraulic fracturing, which took place 24 hours a day in March and April 2010, the huge open shed served as a parking area and meeting place.
Day pointed to where there had been a truck spill of chemically treated water used in fracking, and then he pointed to the stream below, which flows into the watershed at Ten-Mile Creek and then onto the Monongahela River. The spill hadn't reached the stream, he said. Moreover, he'd been impressed with Range Resource's openness about what happened. Every hour while fracking, workers walked the temporary plastic pipeline, full of chemical water, that ran between his site and the pond near Stacey Haney's home. While walking the line, workers discovered several cracks that spilled frack water on the frozen ground. Such cracks are not unusual. ''We all know they leak,'' one Range employee wrote in an internal e-mail, which has become a matter of public record pending a lawsuit.
''None of it leaked on my property,'' Day said later. Finally, the guard let us go up and take a look at the 3.5-acre chemical impoundment, known as a frack pond, which was 20 feet deep. The used frack water, called flowback, was milky gray. The aerators hummed. The impoundment, like many nearby, sat at the top of a watershed. We'd only been at the pond for a couple of minutes before a sedan raced up the hill behind us. My access had been denied. Later, Matt Pitzarella, a spokesman for Range Resources, said that OSHA regulations regarding equipment and the company's own safety standards required that all visitors wear protective gear.
Day drove me next to the well pad, a football field of cement and a few condensate tanks that painters were rendering forest green. Long before the recent drillers came, this was named the Well Field, after an oil well locals said was drilled here in the 1920s. Like some of his neighbors, Day signed a gas lease in part to protect his land from what he saw as a far more rapacious industry headed his way: long-wall coal mining, a process that takes a ribbon of coal out of a seam over miles. ''Long-wall mining is so much more destructive than this, the way I see it,'' he said. ''Hopefully with these pipes they wouldn't want to mine coal underneath us.''
The fracturing was now over, the major pieces of equipment were gone and the field was replanted with medium red clover. Day wasn't concerned about the impact of drilling. ''Nothing I've seen would indicate an adverse effect,'' he said, ''except the odor coming off the compressor station.'' (Range Resources/ told Day that the smell comes from anaerobic bacteria that are more prevalent in this fracking process but that they are harmless. Investigating air quality around compressor stations is part of the E.P.A.'s ongoing study.) Day, like most of his neighbors, trusted the companies to use best practices. A man's word means a lot here. After all, without regulation or oversight, he and other farmers worked together to do things like fence streams to keep cattle out of them.
We drove back through an alfalfa field to the farm. ''You haven't asked me what my profession is,'' Day said. I'd assumed he was a farmer. ''No one here could survive on farming,'' he replied. ''I taught science in local schools for 35 years.''
For Day and others, allowing the gas company to drill on their land isn't simply a matter of cash. They also firmly believe that natural gas should be used as a bridge between foreign oil and sustainable energy sources, like solar and wind. ''Natural gas is the most eco-friendly fuel source that we have,'' said Rick Baker, 59, a piano tuner who lives on 91 acres located between Bill Hartley and Stacey Haney. ''Some people will argue with me on this, but it burns clean.'' He's such a proponent of drilling that he even agreed to star in a commercial for Range Resources, for which he was paid $200.
About a year before Haney's dog died, in the summer of 2009, she began to notice that sometimes her water was black and that it seemed to be eating away at her faucets, washing machine, hot-water heater and dishwasher. When she took a shower, the smell was terrible -- like rotten eggs and diarrhea. Haney started buying bottled water for drinking and cooking, but she couldn't afford to do the same for her animals.
Later that summer, her son, Harley, was stricken with mysterious stomach pains and periods of extreme fatigue, which sent him to the emergency room and to Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital a half-dozen times. ''He couldn't lift his head out of my lap,'' Haney said. Early in November of the following year, after the animals died, Haney decided to have Harley tested for heavy metals and ethylene glycol. While she waited for the results, Haney called Range Resources and asked that it supply her with drinking water. The company tested her water and found nothing wrong with it. Haney's father began to haul water to her barn.
A week later, on Haney's 41st birthday, Harley's test results came back. Harley had elevated levels of arsenic. Haney called Range Resources again. The company delivered a 5,100-gallon tank of drinking water, called a water buffalo, the next day. ''Our policy is if you have a complaint or a concern, we'll supply you with a water source within 24 hours,'' Pitzarella of Range Resources said. He added that the company has ''never seen any evidence that anyone in that household has arsenic issues.''
Although she was able to work 40 hours as a nurse and care for two kids and a small farm, Haney wasn't feeling great, either. So a few months later, she had herself and Paige tested too. Their tests results showed they had small amounts of heavy metals like arsenic and industrial solvents like benzene and toluene in their blood. Dr. Philip Landrigan of Mount Sinai said that the results show evidence of exposure, but that it was difficult to determine potential health effects at the levels found. But he added: ''These people are exposed to arsenic and benzene, known human carcinogens. There's considered to be no safe levels of these chemicals.'' Pitzarella says that Range Resources was never shown these reports and that arsenic has nothing to do with fracking. Pitzarella cited a study by the Center for Rural Pennsylvania that found that 40 percent of Pennsylvania's water wells had at least one pre-existing water-quality problem, and that there was no obvious influence on private water-well quality from fracking. In a previous study, 2 percent of the state's wells had arsenic levels that exceeded health standards.
Soon Haney and her kids began to notice that even outdoors it smelled a lot like the shower -- a combination of sweet metal, rotten eggs and raw sewage. Talking to neighbors, Haney learned that atop a hill, about 1,500 feet from her home and less than 800 feet from that of her neighbor, Beth Voyles, there was an open, five-acre chemical impoundment filled with chemically treated water.
Haney figured out how to navigate Google Earth on her son's computer. (She doesn't own one, nor does she have an e-mail address.) There was her gravel driveway and her house hidden under the canopy of maple trees. And there was the six-football-field-square black pond that dwarfed her neighbor's silver-roofed house. The grass surrounding the pond looked dead.
Popular concerns about natural-gas drilling have centered on what chemicals companies are putting into the earth, not least because this list is a proprietary secret. In 2005, Vice President Dick Cheney spearheaded an amendment to the energy bill, which critics call the Halliburton Loophole. This legislation exempts hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act and protects companies like Halliburton, of which Cheney was once the C.E.O., from disclosing what chemicals are going into the ground.
But the problem, it turns out, lies also in the dissolved substances coming out: namely salts (bromides, chlorides), radionuclides like strontium and barium, as well as what are commonly called BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene), volatile organic compounds that can be injurious to human health.
The industry acknowledges that the question of how to handle the wastewater that comes from fracking is one of its most pressing problems. In Pennsylvania this problem is particularly acute. Pennsylvania's geological formations, unlike those of other states where natural-gas drilling has occurred, don't allow for the usual method of disposal: injection wells that store flowback deep below the earth's surface. Disposing of the chemical water has meant trucking it to another state or paying local treatment facilities to process it. The facilities, which are not equipped to remove salts, have often sent the frack water back into local rivers. In 2008, a United States Steel plant in Clairton, Pa., complained that the water from the Monongahela River was unfit for use. Loaded with salts, the water tasted and smelled odd and was corroding not only industrial equipment but also dishwashers and kitchen faucets. For several months, the Monongahela River, which provides most people in the Pittsburgh area with drinking water, no longer met state and federal standards. Following a request from the State of Pennsylvania, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found it would require five times the amount of water in their reservoirs to dilute the river. It took five months to clean it up.
''Salt is a serious problem,'' Rose Reilly, a water biologist for the Army Corps of Engineers, said. It has to be managed like any other pollutant. ''It isn't biodegradable.''
This past spring, in response to public outcry, Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection asked gas companies to stop sending flowback to treatment plants. But it was a request -- not a regulation. And enacting such measures is expensive. Shale gas is different from other kinds of oil exploration because there's no eureka moment. If you drill, you're sure to hit it. ''This is a widget business,'' says Bobby Vagt, president of the Heinz Endowment, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit that supports development in southwestern Pennsylvania; he ran gas and oil companies in Texas for 15 years. ''The lower you can keep the costs -- of every step of the process, including pipelines and road building -- the more money you're going to make.''
The challenge, as Tim Kelsey, a professor of agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State, points out, ''is making sure that the community isn't left holding the bag.'' This is an economic issue as much as an environmental one. Banks have expressed reluctance to back home mortgages within up to three miles of a well. Whole towns could become brown fields, and home values would drop precipitously. Currently, companies operating in Pennsylvania pay no tax to extract gas. (Gov. Tom Corbett reportedly received at least $1 million in campaign donations from gas interests.) Corbett recently introduced legislation that would levy fees that critics say would amount to a tax of 1 percent per well on gas extraction, significantly lower than Arkansas (3.54 percent) and Texas (5.4 percent). Pennsylvania Democrats call the measure, which they see as friendly to oil and gas interests, ''Drill, baby, drill.''
But for men like Bill Hartley and others who welcome the arrival of fracking in the state, it's not the politics of deep drilling that matter. What matters is preserving common resources. ''My one concern is our water,'' Hartley said. ''My grandfather taught me water is life.''
On Sunday May 8, 2011, Mother's Day, when Haney and her kids were returning from dinner at a nearby Cracker Barrel restaurant, they turned onto McAdams Road, and the smell of raw sewage was ''enough to make you gag,'' Haney's daughter, Paige, told me. They weren't the only ones to smell it. Beth Voyles, Haney's neighbor, called the Department of Environmental Protection to register yet another complaint about the stench. The D.E.P. sent out a water specialist, John Carson. His field notes, made public following a subpoena, indicate that he, too, smelled a ''strong odor'' at the impoundment but not on her property. Voyles claims that Carson refused to take her complaint. When asked for comment, a D.E.P. spokesman, Kevin Sunday, said in an e-mail that the ''D.E.P. responds promptly to any and all complaints. There is an ongoing investigation into the impoundment. This is a matter of active litigation and cannot be discussed further.'' Range Resources says that the D.E.P. visited the area on 24 separate occasions and found no malodor.
Range Resources did have an explanation: the power had failed at the impoundment, shutting down the aerators that move oxygen into the water to prevent bacteria from growing. Range Resources maintains that a D.E.P. study from 2010 indicates no air pollution of any kind at the pond next door to the Haneys and the Voyleses, or anywhere else, for that matter. Critics of this study say the effect of fracking on air quality remains underinvestigated.
That same day, when Voyles told Range Resources she had developed blisters in her nose, it offered to put her up in a hotel, as it does for all nuisance complaints, but she didn't want to leave her dogs and horses behind. (Range later said that it had no record of the complaint.) Next door on McAdams Road, Haney and her kids began to have intense periods of dizziness and nosebleeds. Of the three, Harley was the worst off. Haney took him to their family physician, Craig Fox, in the nearby town of Washington. Like most local doctors, Dr. Fox had never seen such symptoms before.
Haney says that Dr. Fox's advice to her was unequivocal: ''Get Harley out of that house right away. I don't want him anywhere near there, even driving by, for 30 days.'' So Haney took Harley to a friend's house in Eighty-Four, a town named for the lumber company. She took her daughter to her parents' house in Amity. Each day, she spent about four hours in the car shuttling the kids from school, to and from friends' homes and driving to the farm to feed the animals, which were O.K. some days and vomiting or collapsing on others. Haney found a cousin willing to take her pigs, but she had nowhere to house the other animals, so they remained at the farm. She stayed home for less than an hour at a time, long enough to put a load of laundry into the washer. Every two days, she spent $50 on gas. Their farmhouse stood abandoned. ''Our home has become a $300,000 cat mansion,'' Haney said when I visited her in July.
Haney is no left-leaning environmentalist; she is a self-proclaimed redneck who is proud to trace her roots here back at least 150 years. This is not the kind of fight she usually takes on. ''I'm not going to sit back and let them make my kids sick,'' she says. ''People ask me why I don't just move out, but where would I go? I can't afford another mortgage, and if I default on this place, we will lose it. ''
Beth Voyles is equally frustrated. Although the results of her medical tests are inconclusive, she complains of blisters in her nose and throat, headaches and nosebleeds, joint aches, rashes, an inability to concentrate, a metal taste in her mouth. Voyles filed suit against the Department of Environmental Protection in May. Range Resources chose to join the case, because its rights are also at stake. Documents from industry sources and the D.E.P. -- now a matter of public record -- support the suit's allegations of a series of structural violations and hazardous incidents surrounding the pond. They include half a dozen tears in the pond's plastic liner (at least one caused by a deer -- its carcass had to be dragged out); at least four cracks in a temporary plastic transfer pipeline leading to an open field; two truck spills, one of which contaminated a cattle pasture; and a leak in an adjacent pond that held drill cuttings. Range admits that after this leak, the level of total dissolved solids, or salts, spiked in the water. Of all these violations, the D.E.P. issued a citation for only the last. The D.E.P. declined to comment, citing the ongoing case.
In mid-July, Voyles's 25-year-old daughter, Ashley, was riding her paint gelding, Dude, behind the chemical pond. Ashley could hear a hissing and bubbling sound in the stream. There were pools of red foamy oil slick. ''It was rainbow water,'' Ashley said. The next morning Haney and Voyles called in the alphabet soup of government agencies they've contacted over the past year to test the water in the pools: the D.E.P., the E.P.A., the Fish and Boat Commission. They also called Range Resources. Sunday, the D.E.P. spokesman, said that it was most likely decayed vegetation that gave off gas. Later, test results of the area commissioned by Range Resources revealed the presence of acetone, toluene, benzene, phenol, arsenic, barium, heavy metals and methane. The company maintains that none of these were found in drinking water.
Bill Hartley, Rick Baker, Beth Voyles and Stacey Haney received their first royalty checks this summer from the nine gas wells that lie on the square mile between them. Stacey used most of her $9,000 check to pay off the bills she incurred: $4,500 went to co-pays and deductibles for doctors' visits; $1,150 went to pay for gas. She set $2,700 aside to pay taxes on the earnings. The remaining $750 she used as a down payment on a camper. Haney finally moved the kids to live behind her parents' home in Amity. Subsequently, the benzene and toluene levels in each of her children's urine dropped precipitously. For Haney, who continues to return to the farm to feed the animals every evening, the benzene and toluene levels remain higher. Harley still suffers from acute nausea, for which his doctor has prescribed Zofran, a medication frequently given to chemotherapy patients. ''They've ruined our lives,'' Haney said. ''I have to worry every day if my kids are going to have cancer. I will worry for the rest of my life about them with the amount of carcinogens we now have in our blood. We've lost everything -- our pets, the value of our house. No amount of money that we'd ever get from royalties would ever replace my children's health.''
The people of Amwell are no strangers to the price of development -- the loss of a farm's spring, the sinking of a family home when the coal mine burrows beneath it -- or the price of its absence -- shuttered mills and lost jobs. But given our energy needs, the use of fracking and the number of wells are likely to grow. The question is whether regulations to address environmental and health issues can keep pace with a booming industry.
Haney's neighbors have heard about Harley's illness. ''I don't know what to make of it,'' his cousin Bill Hartley says. ''It could very well be there's a leak in the pond.'' Haney's neighbor Rick Baker is also unsure of what the problem is. ''I don't deny there's something going on there,'' he said. ''It concerns me.'' He called Range Resources after it first delivered the water buffalo to say he was glad the company was taking care of the problem. Baker stands by the positive impact the industry has had on Amwell and thousands of other townships. ''This is definitely the right thing for Western Pennsylvania,'' he says. ''We're sitting on one of the largest natural-gas reserves in the world. We need this natural gas to keep functioning.'' And the economic benefits were essential, he adds. ''There are still people sitting in bars waiting for the steel mills to reopen.'' Yet Baker says he feels different from the way he did six months ago, when we first spoke. ''The safety and environmental issues have to be addressed,'' he says. The future scares him. With big oil -- Chevron, BP, among others -- looking to get involved in the industry, Baker fears that it won't be accountable to individuals like himself and Haney.
Haney still made it to this year's Washington County Fair, where her daughter, Paige, lost the Spam bake-off. Paige's goat, Crunch, won first place, and her rabbit, Phantom, almost took best in show. As usual, Pappy's butternuts placed first. In the fair's main hall at the craft division, a glossy ribbon hung from a child's three-foot high Lego Patterson rig, a model of a gas well. It won first prize.

HEADLINE: Remembering Teddy Forstmann

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: DealBook is collecting memories of Theodore Forstmann from some of the prominent financiers, Washington insiders and media moguls who worked with him over the years. 

 BODY:
4:28 p.m. | Updated Over his more than 40 years as a financier and philanthropist, Theodore J. Forstmann rubbed shoulders with prominent figures from the worlds of Wall Street, Washington and Hollywood alike.
With the news that Mr. Forstmann died on Sunday at age 71, some of those people are offering their memories of the mogul.
We will update this list as we get more quotes. (The quotes from the three former secretaries of state come from a press release from Forstmann Little.) If you have any memories of Mr. Forstmann, please leave them in the comments below.
Henry R. Kravis, co-founder and co-chairman of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
No matter what he undertook, whether it be private equity or philanthropy or sports, it didn't matter. He was passionate about it.
He was extremely competitive. He did everything extremely well. He was a man who had a lot to be proud of. 
He turned around IMG and Gulfstream, and he did those things personally. He was a fantastic father. He was incredible with his kids. 
I have a lot of respect for him.
James B. Lee Jr., JPMorgan Chase vice chairman and Forstmann Little's longtime banker
We had lent him the money to buy Gulfstream. The stock market had crashed and the deep credit crunch bit hard. If you were a public company and owned a corporate jet you either sold it or left it in the hangar as it was a sign of excess. Sales of Gulfstreams ground to a halt and the company had to be restructured. Soon thereafter Nick and Ted came to see me at the bank and said they would turn off their sub debt coupon and push the maturity out -- and they asked me to do same, which I said I would. But only if there was a downsized operating plan.
Ted said, "Yes, Jimmy, I have a new plan, but its not to downsize! It's to build a G V." I said, "You can't be serious! That will cost hundreds of millions. Nobody will buy them and we won't have paid down any debt in the meantime."
He had thought it out carefully and said he would sell them himself and take over as C.E.O. We went through the plan and, with Ted's personal commitment to be C.E.O., I agreed. Over the next several years he started building the G V and indeed sold them himself.
The recession ended. They launched the V. They were a big hit. And the company was sold at an enormous profit.
It was Teddy's greatest deal and will go down as the largest turnaround in the history of the L.B.O. business. It truly was classic Teddy."
Meredith Whitney, the chief executive of the Meredith Whitney Advisory Group research firm
A couple of years ago in Capetown, South Africa, Teddy walked into an event with 10 6' blonde super models. He proceeded to be interviewed with his friend Sir Martin Sorrell by Fortune's editor in chief, Andy Serwer. 
While his entrance turned many heads, it was what he said about business and philanthropy that stunned the crowd. He accomplished so much in business and philanthropy, but he rarely talked about it. It was only through the prodding of an interview that small glimpses of his accomplishments were mentioned. 
He was uncomparably generous and loyal to his friends. His annual Aspen conference was considered the most thought-leading, exclusive conference of its kind. He was forever on a quest for learning. Women loved him, men wanted to be like him. 
We will all miss him.
Robert Strauss, a founder of the law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld and a member of the Forstmann Little advisory board
Ted Forstmann was as smart and tough a guy as I have ever known - but those were small things when compared with his generosity and decency. Teddy was my friend for a very long time and I will miss everything about him.
Tom Lister, Permira's co-managing partner and a former partner of Forstmann Little
Many in the private equity industry today talk about the importance of business transformation to generating attractive returns. Ted was a pioneer in that investing in companies where there was a huge opportunity to remake and reposition the business strategically. The examples of Gulfstream General Instrument and Community Health Systems are a great case in point. All of them were made substantially more competitive and valuable under Ted and Forstmann Little's leadership. 
He had a unique ability to see where the business could and should be five years hence and then drive to the outcome.
Sandra Horbach, the head of the Carlyle Group's global consumer and retail team and a longtime friend of Mr. Forstmann
Ted was an amazing mentor, partner and friend to me for much of my professional career. He was a brilliant investor, and taught me how to think unconventionally and creatively when looking at new investment opportunities, as well as how to create real value by investing in growth and building great businesses such as Gulfstream, Yankee Candle and Community Health. 
Ted also had a huge heart; he really cared about people, and would always go out of his way to help someone. His generosity of spirit, even in difficult situations, has been an inspiration to me and serves as an example I try to live by every day.
Henry Kissinger
Forstmann Little reflected the qualities of its founder and chairman: reliability, analytical skill and foresight. Teddy was an inspiring colleague and indispensable friend.
George P. Shultz
Under his leadership, the board had constructive and penetrating discussions but we also had fun. Now, every time I step on any kind of plane, I think of Teddy and his magnificent accomplishments.
Colin Powell
Teddy introduced me to the world of business and I will always be grateful to him for extending his hand to me, embracing me and making me his friend and business associate. My story is not that different from so many other people who were touched by the Teddy magic.

HEADLINE: A Little Soul-Searching in Iowa

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY AND TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Six Republican presidential candidates diverged from their usual campaign conversations to offer a glimpse into how hardships and faith have shaped their lives. 

 BODY:
 DES MOINES - Six Republican presidential candidates on Saturday night diverged from their usual campaign conversations about the economy, foreign policy and President Obama to offer a glimpse into how hardships and faith have shaped their lives.
 With just six weeks before the Iowa caucuses open the Republican nominating contest, several candidates are vigorously competing to be seen as the leading social conservative of the field. The candidates gathered here on Saturday and renewed their opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage, while also offering deeply personal stories seldom heard on the campaign trail.
 Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been married three times, acknowledged a period in his life when he was succeeding politically but "failing personally." He said a friend offered him a handbook from Alcoholics Anonymous.
 "I wasn't drinking," Mr. Gingrich said, "but I had precisely the symptoms of somebody who was collapsing from under this weight."
 Before more than 2,000 people at the First Federated Church, Mr. Gingrich did not mention the details of an affair with a former Congressional aide or the political challenges that followed after he lost the support of his party and he stepped down from his Republican leadership position in Congress. He told the audience that he and his wife, Callista, have "a wonderful marriage," and that he was close to his children and grandchildren.
 "All of that has required a great deal of pain, some of which I have caused others, which I regret deeply," Mr. Gingrich said. "All of which required having to go to God to seek both reconciliation but also to seek God's acceptance that I had to recognize how limited I was and how much I had to depend on Him."
The two-hour event, which was sponsored by a Christian group called the Family Leader, was one of the more unusual forums of the campaign. The candidates took their seats around a table decorated with a Thanksgiving motif. The moderator, the Republican pollster Frank Luntz, walked them through a variety of campaign issues but also urged them to offer personal revelations or vulnerabilities.
"If there ever was a place to bare your soul, this is the place to do it," Mr. Luntz told the candidates. At one point, he declared, "I feel like Dr. Phil."
Herman Cain grew emotional as he talked about his struggle with cancer. He did not discuss accusations of sexual harassment from more than a decade ago that led to two financial settlements from women on his staff at the National Restaurant Association. Asked to share a regret from his life, he said, "No one is perfect."
"I believe that I have had a series of little failures, rather than one great big disaster," he said, adding that his time as a business executive often took him away from his family. "One little failure in my mind was that I didn't believe I was home enough when my kids were growing up."
The audience listened intently as former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania talked about Bella, his 3-year-old daughter, who struggled to live after being born with a chromosomal defect that can result in stillbirth. His voice broke and he wiped away tears as he confessed that he initially resisted loving her, saying, "I decided the best thing I could do was to treat her differently and not love her like I did because it wouldn't hurt as much if I'd lost her."
He then went on to explain why he vehemently opposed abortion and the national health care law signed by President Obama.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Representative Ron Paul of Texas also were seated around the table during the session. Twice, Mr. Perry leaned over to one of his rivals and sought to comfort them as they told their stories.
When he took his turn, Mr. Perry told the crowd that he felt lost after being discharged from the Air Force, but found comfort by finding his Christian faith. He said, "In every person's heart and soul there is a hole that can only be filled by the Lord Jesus Christ."
Later, he drew laughter when he declared, "If you want to see God laugh, tell him your plans."
The candidates were seeking the endorsement from a sponsor of the event, Bob Vander Plaats, an influential and controversial evangelical figure who led a successful campaign last year to remove three Iowa judges who had ruled for the legality of same-sex marriage.
Mitt Romney, who struggled to win over social conservative voters four years ago in Iowa, did not attend. His absence was noted by Mr. Vander Plaats, who told reporters after the event that "Romney was the only one who stiffed us."
The candidates have all invested considerable time trying to win support from Christian conservative voters, who are an influential segment of the electorate in the Iowa caucuses. Polls suggest that evangelical voters have yet to rally around a single alternative to Mr. Romney.
The civil conversation on stage, where candidates traded compliments and listened respectfully to one another, belied the fierce competition that is under way in the pursuit of evangelical voters. 
As the event began, Mrs. Bachmann walked around the table and poured water for everyone. In the closing minutes, her campaign issued a statement with a headline that declared: "Newt Gingrich Has Failed to Meet a Consistently Pro-Life Standard."
Mr. Paul, who has emerged as a top-tier candidate in Iowa in recent polls, distinguished himself from his Republican rivals when the conversation turned to the justification of war. He said that the United States should not have been engaged in any of its wars since World War II. 
He said that getting involved in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars "wasn't in our national defense," citing 8,500 Americans who had been killed. "It was mischief, getting involved where we don't need to be involved," he said. "I think it is an utter tragedy."
But Mr. Gingrich drew the loudest applause by striking a hawkish posture toward Iran and the potential for its nuclear capability. Mr. Gingrich linked the country to the militant Islam behind the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
"This is a place where I disagree with some of my friends," Mr. Gingrich said. "You come into our country, you killed 3,100 people, and we will do whatever it takes to eliminate your capacity to threaten us ever again."
He added, "I would say to the government of Iran today: 'You have a very short time to solve this on our own, and if you don't, we will solve it for you, and we frankly could care less what the rest of the world thinks.'"

HEADLINE: #trendingnyc: The Week on Twitter

BYLINE: MATT FLEGENHEIMER


HIGHLIGHT: #OccupyWallStreet, an unresponsive East Village landlord, and a Jets loss were among the topics trending this week on Twitter. 

 BODY:
Their camp was evicted. Their property was removed. Many had not slept. But as dawn began to break over Lower Manhattan on Tuesday morning, just hours after the Occupy Wall Street protesters had been driven from Zuccotti Park in an overnight police operation, a hush fell over the huddled masses reconvened in Foley Square.
"Hey!" a man shouted, raising his smartphone aloft. "We're trending on Twitter!"
That may have been an understatement. If the displaced protesters seemed ubiquitous on the streets this week - marching, chanting and clogging traffic after their eviction and during a series of planned demonstrations on Thursday - their Twitter footprint was at least as large. Trending topics included: Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, Broadway and Pine, #OFS (for "Occupy Foley Square"), competing spellings of "Zuccotti Park," Union Square, Ray Kelly, #bloomberg, Day of Action and the N.Y.P.D.
On Tuesday, as officers lined the perimeter of the park, preventing protesters from entering, many users - and demonstrators - noted the role reversal. @OccupyWallSt posted:
@OccupyWallSt Occupy Wall Street
http://t.co/rMjO3Uls NYPD Occupying Liberty Square; Demands Unclear #LibertySq#ows
Tue Nov 15 18:36:46 via Occupy Wall Street

Thursday's activities, which included an unsuccessful attempt to shut down the New York Stock Exchange, gatherings on major subway lines and a twilight march to the Brooklyn Bridge, drew the ire of some residents. @YaleZeller sneered:
@YaleZeller Yale Zeller
Thank God #OWS Day of Action is going on. I woke up this morning hoping to double my commute time, waste city money, and hear Michael Moore.
Thu Nov 17 15:36:30 via Yale Zeller
Meanwhile, the tenants of an East Village building took to Twitter to address what they deemed another social injustice: their unresponsive landlord. Residents griped under the handle @Jakobson_Fix_It, imploring the building owner, Jakobson Properties, to heed their complaints:
@Jakobson_Fix_It Jakobson, Fix It!!
Anon: rats, no water, no heat, allergies - I'd rather live in Jersey than at Jakobson again (wow!) http://t.co/Bxl9p916#stories
Mon Nov 14 11:50:25 via Jakobson, Fix It!!
Late Thursday night, the Jets' National Football League playoff hopes took a hit when they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory against the Broncos in Denver. @NotWaltFrazier, an account that imitates the poetic stylings of the Knicks' famed guard-turned-television commentator, wrote that Denver's thin air could not justify such a poor showing:
@NotWaltFrazier (Not) Walt Frazier
Did the #Jets really just pull the "altitude" card? Lack of blood infusin' is no excuse for losin'! #TNF
Fri Nov 18 22:08:14 via (Not) Walt Frazier
And on Friday, users watched as Regis Philbin, who grew up in the Bronx, celebrated his final episode of "Live with Regis and Kelly" after 28 years as the program's host. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg dropped in to present Mr. Philbin with a key to the city. James Poniewozik, a columnist for Time, predicted what might have happened after the segment ended:
@poniewozik James Poniewozik
Mike Bloomberg comes to say goodbye, after which NYPD riot cops will throw Regis' belongings in a garbage truck. #regisfarewell

PERSON: Sanford Garelik 

HEADLINE: Sanford Garelik, 93, Dies; Ran for Mayor

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
Sanford D. Garelik, a former New York City mayoral candidate and a City Council president who served the city amid the fiscal and criminal turmoil of the 1970s, died Saturday in Manhattan. He was 93.
His death was confirmed by his son, Neal.
After becoming the first Jewish chief inspector in the New York Police Department -- the highest uniformed rank at the time -- Mr. Garelik became president of the City Council under Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1970 and mounted an unsuccessful bid to succeed Mr. Lindsay three years later. From 1975 to 1979, Mr. Garelik served as chief of the Transit Police Department, also assuming the duties of director of security for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1977. 
''He was a Jewish cop,'' said Jay Mazur, a friend who assisted with Mr. Garelik's mayoral campaign, ''so nothing human was alien to him.''
During his tenure on the City Council, Mr. Garelik cast himself as a voice of fiscal reason as the city began to enter a period of economic disarray. Citing doubts about the estimated cost of renovating Yankee Stadium in 1971, he suggested what might have qualified as heresy for a Bronx native like him: that the Yankees join the Mets in Shea Stadium and demolish the House That Ruth Built to make way for a garment center.
Sanford Daniel Garelik was born on Aug. 15, 1918, to a Bronx family with a dairy business for which he worked as a bottler in his youth. He was a member of the Police Academy's class of 1940 and received the department's Combat Cross a year later for wounding a fugitive from a holdup while off duty in the Bronx.
Gertrude Schimmel, another member of the 1940 class, who became the first female deputy chief of police in 1978, recalled that Mr. Garelik once jumped out of his car to make an arrest, even after he had become ''a big chief'' in the department.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly praised Mr. Garelik on Sunday for his ''keen intellect, drive and passion'' for the job. ''Even bigots forgot why they had opposed his accession,'' Mr. Kelly said.
As a candidate for mayor -- buttons for his campaign, quickly aborted amid flailing poll numbers, are available online for $3.95 -- Mr. Garelik presented a law-and-order platform. His hallmark slogan, Mr. Garelik's son recalled Sunday, was ''Enough is enough.'' In 1972, Mr. Garelik proposed a monthly ''Anti-Graffiti Day'' to combat what he deemed a scourge that ''pollutes the eye and mind.''
In 1980, Mr. Garelik was removed from his position with the transit police by Mayor Edward I. Koch as part of an effort to place the transit police under the auspices of the Police Department.
''There wasn't any reason I recall that was negative,'' Mr. Koch said on Sunday about the move. ''But we were going to consolidate. You have one police commissioner.''
After his ouster, Mr. Garelik established the Garment Center Economic Security Council and later oversaw security for the Fashion Center Business Improvement District until 2004.
In addition to his son, Mr. Garelik is survived by a brother, Bernard Garelik, and four grandchildren.
Mr. Garelik's wife of 57 years, the former Catherine Clark, died in 2007. The two met in 1947, at a hospital in East Harlem, where she oversaw the emergency room. Mr. Garelik had arrived in plain clothes to speak to an officer, who had been shot, as part of an investigation. His future wife informed him that patients were not seeing visitors. But as Mr. Garelik searched for the officer's room regardless, she chased him, jumping on his back. ''Somebody call the police,'' she shouted.
''Lady,'' he said to the woman he would ask to a Broadway show one week later, ''I am the police.''

HEADLINE: Arts Center Reflects a New Dawn on the Prairie

BYLINE: By ZACHARY WOOLFE

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In America the arts are always on the lookout for a new home.
This city's Convention Hall, a noble Beaux-Arts building, opened in 1899. Enrico Caruso and Geraldine Farrar sang ''La Boheme'' there, on tour with the Metropolitan Opera, and Sarah Bernhardt played Camille.
Less than 40 years later the hall was torn down to provide parking for the Municipal Auditorium, a moody Art Deco monolith that went up across the street in 1934. The Kansas City Philharmonic played there for decades. But the Philharmonic dissolved in 1982; a reconstituted Kansas City Symphony joined the Lyric Opera of Kansas City and the Kansas City Ballet at the slowly crumbling Lyric Theater nearby.
The next decades were hard ones for the city, which struggled with suburban flight. Only recently has downtown Kansas City begun to revive. As its fortunes have turned, the three companies inhabiting the Lyric Theater have wanted -- needed -- a new space that would reflect their high ambitions. 
The answer, more than 15 years in the making, is the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, financed largely by the Kauffman pharmaceutical fortune, designed by the architect Moshe Safdie and built on a hilltop with an expansive glass lobby wall overlooking the city. (The spacious, gracious site was previously owned by Ross Perot.) Last week I attended three performances there, and it is one of the most enjoyable, exhilarating arts centers I've been to, a moving celebration of a city's upward trajectory.
The symphony got the best deal when the center's two theaters were planned. While the 1,800-seat Muriel Kauffman Theater, where the opera and ballet perform, is pleasant, the orchestra's slightly smaller Helzberg Hall is spectacular, with an astonishingly warm, present sound. Seating sections surround the stage, giving the handsome hall an excitingly intimate feel.
The symphony and its music director, Michael Stern, have planned an ambitious, varied opening season featuring three world premieres and works by Messiaen, Schnittke and Lutoslawski in addition to grand standards like Brahms's ''German Requiem'' and Mahler's Second Symphony. On Friday evening it presented a broadly dramatic program: Bartok's ''Miraculous Mandarin'' Suite, Prokofiev's Suite from ''The Love for Three Oranges,'' Hindemith's ''Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes of Carl Maria von Weber'' and Rachmaninoff's ''Paganini Variations'' (with the young pianist Behzod Abduraimov, who plays with technical assurance and phrases with refreshing naturalness).
Mr. Stern has built an impressively taut ensemble; sometimes, as in the Rachmaninoff, that tautness veered toward stiffness. While not the subtlest of this season's tantalizing programs -- it had a lot of Orientalism for one sitting -- it was good fun and an alluring showcase for the hall's acoustics and this excellent orchestra's many colors.
The Kauffman Center's architectural references aren't very subtle, either. From the outside the two theaters are curving inverted ziggurats, pristinely white, that evoke Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum; the stainless-steel cladding on the arched exterior gives off a Frank Gehry vibe. And those nesting arches recall a familiar Australian opera house: when I told someone here that I was in town to see the new performing-arts center, he said, ''Oh, the Sydney-looking one?''
The building nevertheless manages to feel distinctive and local. The Wright shout-out is honestly earned: three of Wright's works, including the pristinely white Community Christian Church, stand in Kansas City. It took a blustery day for me to notice that the building's arching forms suggest not so much Sydney's waves as tall prairie grasses swaying in the wind.
Those arches, viewed from behind, are actually symmetrical, resembling the hundreds of fountains that are this city's joy as well as the burnished steel curves that accent the Deco interiors of the Municipal Auditorium a few blocks away. Similarly, the array of dramatically angled cables that support the building's soaring south-facing glass wall and ceiling echo the cables anchoring the four immense obelisks over the convention center next door.
I've never seen a performing-arts space that seems to relish its location so much, to be so proud of the city it shows off. People appear delighted just to be there; the Kauffman Center has glamour, that indefinable, impossible-to-engineer quality. It is accessible and even friendly, but it elevates you; there's the sensation of going someplace.
It has been wildly popular since its September opening. Interviewed in a weekly local newspaper, the KCTV weather forecaster seemed to speak for everyone here when she answered, ''Built the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts,'' when asked to finish the sentence ''Kansas City got it right when it -- .''
But the project does call into question just what constitutes the Kansas City that got it right: the people or the government. The $366 million Kauffman Center declares with pride that its construction was financed wholly from private sources. (The city built and operates the adjacent parking garage.) There could be no greater contrast with the Municipal Auditorium, which was financed wholly by the federal government with New Deal money.
Nearly eight decades separate these two experiments in paying for the arts. For better or worse it's not hard to see which is the norm today. Individuals and the private sector are now presumed able to fulfill almost entirely the philanthropic functions previously shared with government. And individuals can meet that challenge -- sometimes.
But the Kauffman Center, for one, was built by lucky timing as much as by the great generosity and civic-mindedness of its donors. If its history had begun just a couple of years later it wouldn't be open right now; The New York Times reported in September that 24 of 25 gifts of more than $1 million came before the downturn in the economy, and plans for a third, smaller theater in the complex were scrapped as the recession unfolded.
Beneath the thrill of the center's opening are some quiet, understandable concerns, like whether ticket sales will hold up after the first flush of excitement fades. A powerful performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, which has a longstanding presence in Kansas City, was spottily attended on Wednesday evening.
Government ideally brings to the arts the stability that full dependence on the private sector simply can't provide: the ability to weather downturns, to create programming without undue creative compromises. We don't yet know the full implications of the new model, represented in its most extreme form by the new center.
Whatever the source of this center's financing, it's hard not to be in awe of the achievement of creating it. ''A monument to the public spirit and civic ideals of the people,'' reads the inscription over the entrance to the Municipal Auditorium. That spirit and those ideals now reside fully in the Kauffman Center.

HEADLINE: Mobile Payments In Poorer Nations

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Visa has been hard at work on a mobile digital wallet that it hopes to roll out early next year. But that's not the only mobile market the credit card company has its eye on. 
On Wednesday, the company announced plans for a product aimed at letting cellphone users in less developed nations buy goods and pay bills using their phones.
''It won't require a physical card attached to the account,'' said John Partridge, president of Visa. ''It's a virtual prepaid account designed specifically for the mobile market in the developing world.''
The service will be available through a simple application or text messaging, and it will work across mobile operators. Users will be able to add more money to their virtual Visa accounts at special kiosks.
''It's almost like a branchless banking approach,'' Mr. Partridge said. He said the service would be fed in part by the company's acquisition of Fundamo, a financial services company that specializes in international markets, as well as a partnership with the MTN Group, a telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East.
The new service will begin in Nigeria and Uganda and move across the rest of Africa, as well as Asia and Latin America.
Mr. Partridge said the new service was part of Visa's larger strategy of expanding its payment network. The service will charge users a small fee for each transaction.
''We're looking to grow our revenue outside of the United States to balance the revenue growth between the U.S. and the rest of the world,'' he said. ''And we think this is a combination of a terrific opportunity to take payment services to the underbanked and bring more people securely into the economic mainstream.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Archdiocese to Speak Out at Rally Urging City Council to Pass Bill on Wages

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Supporters of a bill that would raise wages at city-subsidized projects are celebrating the introduction of a formidable voice to the debate: the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
Msgr. Kevin Sullivan, executive director of Catholic Charities, is scheduled to speak at a rally on Monday organized by a coalition of religious, labor and community leaders to urge the passage of the bill, originally introduced last year by two City Council members from the Bronx.
The archdiocese has been hesitant to weigh in on legislative matters, and, indeed, Monsignor Sullivan was quick to clarify in an interview Sunday that the archdiocese had not taken ''a specific position'' on the bill, saying it generally did not take a position on any piece of legislation. 
But he added that the rally on Monday, at Riverside Church, would provide an appropriate setting for the archdiocese to address economic hardship and unemployment, matters of utmost concern to the church.
He said he planned to read a statement from Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan, who, Monsignor Sullivan said, will also address these subjects on Tuesday during a Thanksgiving-related event at a Catholic Charities community center in Harlem.
''We're going to speak about how this economic crisis continues to hurt everybody in society, particularly the poor,'' the monsignor said. ''We need to make sure there are decent jobs with decent wages.''
The Council plans to hold a hearing on the bill, called the Fair Wages for New Yorkers Act, on Tuesday. The revised version of the bill would mandate a wage of $10 per hour with benefits, or $11.50 without benefits, for employees of projects that receive at least $1 million in subsidies. Small businesses with $5 million or less in annual revenue, and all manufacturing companies, would be exempt.
The majority of council members have endorsed the bill, which has gathered support among labor leaders and unions, nonprofit groups and clergy members. But it faces fierce opposition, from business leaders, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and others, who contend that it could harm employment and businesses in the city. Mr. Bloomberg has threatened to veto the bill.
Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, could also scuttle the bill by not bringing it up for a vote. She has not publicly declared whether she will support it.
Monsignor Sullivan's appearance at the rally Monday, the bill's advocates said, will provide a major lift to their campaign.
''The Catholic Church's presence at the rally in support of living wages adds great moral and political strength to the movement,'' said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has led the coalition lobbying for the bill.
A spokesman for the union, Dan Morris, said Monsignor Sullivan's appearance would be ''the culmination of a year of intense faith-based coalition building.''
The rally, Living Wage: Many Voices, One Goal, will also include statements by other religious leaders, as well as labor and civil rights activists.
The archdiocese's participation is part of a recent push by Archbishop Dolan to focus more attention in the church on the problems of economic hardship and the importance of living wages.
On Sept. 15, in a letter to all bishops in the United States, he urged members of the Catholic clergy to speak out on the problems of poverty and unemployment.
''The best way out of poverty is to work at a living wage,'' wrote the archbishop, who is also president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. ''The common good will not advance, economic security will not be achieved, and individual initiative will be weakened when so many live without the dignity of work and bear the crushing burden of poverty.''

HEADLINE: Boring Cruel Romantics

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
There's a word I keep hearing lately: ''technocrat.'' Sometimes it's used as a term of scorn -- the creators of the euro, we're told, were technocrats who failed to take human and cultural factors into account. Sometimes it's a term of praise: the newly installed prime ministers of Greece and Italy are described as technocrats who will rise above politics and do what needs to be done.
I call foul. I know from technocrats; sometimes I even play one myself. And these people -- the people who bullied Europe into adopting a common currency, the people who are bullying both Europe and the United States into austerity -- aren't technocrats. They are, instead, deeply impractical romantics. 
They are, to be sure, a peculiarly boring breed of romantic, speaking in turgid prose rather than poetry. And the things they demand on behalf of their romantic visions are often cruel, involving huge sacrifices from ordinary workers and families. But the fact remains that those visions are driven by dreams about the way things should be rather than by a cool assessment of the way things really are.
And to save the world economy we must topple these dangerous romantics from their pedestals.
Let's start with the creation of the euro. If you think that this was a project driven by careful calculation of costs and benefits, you have been misinformed.
The truth is that Europe's march toward a common currency was, from the beginning, a dubious project on any objective economic analysis. The continent's economies were too disparate to function smoothly with one-size-fits-all monetary policy, too likely to experience ''asymmetric shocks'' in which some countries slumped while others boomed. And unlike U.S. states, European countries weren't part of a single nation with a unified budget and a labor market tied together by a common language.
So why did those ''technocrats'' push so hard for the euro, disregarding many warnings from economists? Partly it was the dream of European unification, which the Continent's elite found so alluring that its members waved away practical objections. And partly it was a leap of economic faith, the hope -- driven by the will to believe, despite vast evidence to the contrary -- that everything would work out as long as nations practiced the Victorian virtues of price stability and fiscal prudence.
Sad to say, things did not work out as promised. But rather than adjusting to reality, those supposed technocrats just doubled down -- insisting, for example, that Greece could avoid default through savage austerity, when anyone who actually did the math knew better.
Let me single out in particular the European Central Bank (E.C.B.), which is supposed to be the ultimate technocratic institution, and which has been especially notable for taking refuge in fantasy as things go wrong. Last year, for example, the bank affirmed its belief in the confidence fairy -- that is, the claim that budget cuts in a depressed economy will actually promote expansion, by raising business and consumer confidence. Strange to say, that hasn't happened anywhere.
And now, with Europe in crisis -- a crisis that can't be contained unless the E.C.B. steps in to stop the vicious circle of financial collapse -- its leaders still cling to the notion that price stability cures all ills. Last week Mario Draghi, the E.C.B.'s new president, declared that ''anchoring inflation expectations'' is ''the major contribution we can make in support of sustainable growth, employment creation and financial stability.''
This is an utterly fantastic claim to make at a time when expected European inflation is, if anything, too low, and what's roiling the markets is fear of more or less immediate financial collapse. And it's more like a religious proclamation than a technocratic assessment.
Just to be clear, this is not an anti-European rant, since we have our own pseudo-technocrats warping the policy debate. In particular, allegedly nonpartisan groups of ''experts'' -- the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Concord Coalition, and so on -- have been all too successful at hijacking the economic policy debate, shifting its focus from jobs to deficits.
Real technocrats would have asked why this makes sense at a time when the unemployment rate is 9 percent and the interest rate on U.S. debt is only 2 percent. But like the E.C.B., our fiscal scolds have their story about what's important, and they're sticking to it no matter what the data say.
So am I against technocrats? Not at all. I like technocrats -- technocrats are friends of mine. And we need technical expertise to deal with our economic woes.
But our discourse is being badly distorted by ideologues and wishful thinkers -- boring, cruel romantics -- pretending to be technocrats. And it's time to puncture their pretensions.

HEADLINE: How China Can Defeat America

BYLINE: By YAN XUETONG. 
Yan Xuetong, the author of ''Ancient Chinese Thought, Modern Chinese Power,'' is a professor of political science and dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University. This essay was translated by Zhaowen Wu and David Liu from the Chinese.

 BODY:
Beijing
WITH China's growing influence over the global economy, and its increasing ability to project military power, competition between the United States and China is inevitable. Leaders of both countries assert optimistically that the competition can be managed without clashes that threaten the global order.
Most academic analysts are not so sanguine. If history is any guide, China's rise does indeed pose a challenge to America. Rising powers seek to gain more authority in the global system, and declining powers rarely go down without a fight. And given the differences between the Chinese and American political systems, pessimists might believe that there is an even higher likelihood of war.
I am a political realist. Western analysts have labeled my political views ''hawkish,'' and the truth is that I have never overvalued the importance of morality in international relations. But realism does not mean that politicians should be concerned only with military and economic might. In fact, morality can play a key role in shaping international competition between political powers -- and separating the winners from the losers.
I came to this conclusion from studying ancient Chinese political theorists like Guanzi, Confucius, Xunzi and Mencius. They were writing in the pre-Qin period, before China was unified as an empire more than 2,000 years ago -- a world in which small countries were competing ruthlessly for territorial advantage. 
It was perhaps the greatest period for Chinese thought, and several schools competed for ideological supremacy and political influence. They converged on one crucial insight: The key to international influence was political power, and the central attribute of political power was morally informed leadership. Rulers who acted in accordance with moral norms whenever possible tended to win the race for leadership over the long term.
China was unified by the ruthless king of Qin in 221 B.C., but his short-lived rule was not nearly as successful as that of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, who drew on a mixture of legalistic realism and Confucian ''soft power'' to rule the country for over 50 years, from 140 B.C. until 86 B.C.
According to the ancient Chinese philosopher Xunzi, there were three types of leadership: humane authority, hegemony and tyranny. Humane authority won the hearts and minds of the people at home and abroad. Tyranny -- based on military force -- inevitably created enemies. Hegemonic powers lay in between: they did not cheat the people at home or cheat allies abroad. But they were frequently indifferent to moral concerns and often used violence against non-allies. The philosophers generally agreed that humane authority would win in any competition with hegemony or tyranny.
Such theories may seem far removed from our own day, but there are striking parallels. Indeed, Henry Kissinger once told me that he believed that ancient Chinese thought was more likely than any foreign ideology to become the dominant intellectual force behind Chinese foreign policy.
The fragmentation of the pre-Qin era resembles the global divisions of our times, and the prescriptions provided by political theorists from that era are directly relevant today -- namely that states relying on military or economic power without concern for morally informed leadership are bound to fail.
Unfortunately, such views are not so influential in this age of economic determinism, even if governments often pay lip service to them. The Chinese government claims that the political leadership of the Communist Party is the basis of China's economic miracle, but it often acts as though competition with the United States will be played out on the economic field alone. And in America, politicians regularly attribute progress, but never failure, to their own leadership.
Both governments must understand that political leadership, rather than throwing money at problems, will determine who wins the race for global supremacy.
Many people wrongly believe that China can improve its foreign relations only by significantly increasing economic aid. But it's hard to buy affection; such ''friendship'' does not stand the test of difficult times.
How, then, can China win people's hearts across the world? According to ancient Chinese philosophers, it must start at home. Humane authority begins by creating a desirable model at home that inspires people abroad.
This means China must shift its priorities away from economic development to establishing a harmonious society free of today's huge gaps between rich and poor. It needs to replace money worship with traditional morality and weed out political corruption in favor of social justice and fairness.
In other countries, China must display humane authority in order to compete with the United States, which remains the world's pre-eminent hegemonic power. Military strength underpins hegemony and helps to explain why the United States has so many allies. President Obama has made strategic mistakes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, but his actions also demonstrate that Washington is capable of leading three foreign wars simultaneously. By contrast, China's army has not been involved in any war since 1984, with Vietnam, and very few of its high-ranking officers, let alone its soldiers, have any battlefield experience.
America enjoys much better relations with the rest of the world than China in terms of both quantity and quality. America has more than 50 formal military allies, while China has none. North Korea and Pakistan are only quasi-allies of China. The former established a formal alliance with China in 1961, but there have been no joint military maneuvers and no arms sales for decades. China and Pakistan have substantial military cooperation, but they have no formal military alliance binding them together.
To shape a friendly international environment for its rise, Beijing needs to develop more high-quality diplomatic and military relationships than Washington. No leading power is able to have friendly relations with every country in the world, thus the core of competition between China and the United States will be to see who has more high-quality friends. And in order to achieve that goal, China has to provide higher-quality moral leadership than the United States.
China must also recognize that it is a rising power and assume the responsibilities that come with that status. For example, when it comes to providing protection for weaker powers, as the United States has done in Europe and the Persian Gulf, China needs to create additional regional security arrangements with surrounding countries according to the model of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization -- a regional forum that includes China, Russia and several central Asian countries.
And politically, China should draw on its tradition of meritocracy. Top government officials should be chosen according to their virtue and wisdom, and not simply technical and administrative ability. China should also open up and choose officials from across the world who meet its standards, so as to improve its governance.
The Tang dynasty -- which lasted from the 7th century to the 10th and was perhaps China's most glorious period -- employed a great number of foreigners as high-ranking officials. China should do the same today and compete with America to attract talented immigrants.
OVER the next decade, China's new leaders will be drawn from a generation that experienced the hardships of the Cultural Revolution. They are resolute and will most likely value political principles more than material benefits. These leaders must play a larger role on the world stage and offer more security protection and economic support to less powerful countries.
This will mean competing with the United States politically, economically and technologically. Such competition may cause diplomatic tensions, but there is little danger of military clashes.
That's because future Chinese-American competition will differ from that between the United States and the Soviet Union during the cold war. Neither China nor America needs proxy wars to protect its strategic interests or to gain access to natural resources and technology.
China's quest to enhance its world leadership status and America's effort to maintain its present position is a zero-sum game. It is the battle for people's hearts and minds that will determine who eventually prevails. And, as China's ancient philosophers predicted, the country that displays more humane authority will win.

BOTH the American economy and the global economy are facing a familiar foe: policy defeatism. Throughout modern economic history, whether in Western Europe in the 1920s, in the United States in the 1930s, or in Japan in the 1990s, every major financial crisis has been followed by premature abandonment -- if not reversal -- of the stimulus policies that are necessary for sustained recovery. Sadly, the world appears to be repeating this mistake.
The right thing to do right now is for the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to engage in further monetary stimulus. Having lowered short-term interest rates, they should buy (or in the case of the Fed, resume buying) significant quantities of government securities to help push down long-term interest rates and encourage investment.
If anything, it is past time for the Fed and its European counterpart to act. The economic outlook has turned out to be as grim as forecasts based on historical evidence predicted it would be, given the nature of the recession, the cutbacks in government spending and the simultaneity of economic problems across the Western world. Sustained high inflation is not a threat in this environment. 
As many have observed, we need to rebalance the economy from imports to exports, from private consumption to savings, from tax breaks to infrastructure rebuilding and from the financial sector to everything else. The process of rebalancing will require movement of capital from older industries and activities to newer ones -- that is, investment. Moreover, a lot of what was termed ''investment'' during the boom years was misallocated -- wasted -- capital, so many productive projects were ignored.
But investment has been held back because of uncertainty over the economy's future prospects. And the ability to attract investors is being limited by the giant burden of private-sector debt. In other words, a financing problem is inhibiting the restructuring of our economy. Alleviating generalized financing problems and low investor confidence is precisely what monetary stimulus does.
Some claim that monetary easing will impede restructuring. But this makes no sense. For all the talk that monetary austerity promotes the ''creative destruction'' necessary for the economy to recover, it does not work that way.
In Japan in the 1990s, a period of insufficiently aggressive monetary stimulus fed lending to ''zombie companies'' -- unproductive borrowers on whose loans the banks could not afford to take losses. It was only when macroeconomic policy led a recovery in Japan in the first decade of this century that capital flowed out of the places it had been trapped and into new and growing businesses. Similarly, after the American savings-and-loan crisis, real reallocation of credit from bad banks and borrowers to worthwhile investment began in earnest only when monetary policy eased in the late 1980s.
Another source of policy defeatism is the widespread but false belief that our previous ''unconventional'' efforts to stimulate the economy either were not terribly effective or are unlikely to be effective if extended today. The fact that the American economy has not fully recovered after previous rounds of stimulus is not evidence that those failed to work at all.
We know that infusions of central bank money to the economy have been closely associated with falling long-term interest rates. We know that the relative price of riskier assets has gone up, indicating greater demand for them, when stimulus has been undertaken. And we know that banks have received increased deposits, and that investors and households have expressed increased confidence, after prior rounds of quantitative easing. That combination has had a stimulative impact, just as a cut in the interest rate would have in ordinary times.
Scientific research tells us that high blood pressure and cholesterol are associated with a higher risk of heart disease and stroke, and that certain prescription medications reduce cholesterol and blood pressure. Yes, it is difficult to prove directly that taking these medicines prevents heart disease and stroke, and taking them is no guarantee of health. But still we should take them, and our doctors should prescribe them if they are indicated. This is the same situation we are in now, with our economy's financial circulation at risk, and quantitative easing the indicated medicine.
In my opinion, we can go further. Central banks and governments can engage in forms of coordinated action that will target the burden of past debts that is hanging over the global economy. In the United States, that means resolving the distressed mortgage debt that is weakening our financial system and reducing labor mobility, thereby constraining not only our growth but also our ability to grow. It is time for the Federal Reserve and elected officials to explore ways to jointly tackle that housing debt.
Independent central bankers tend to become very squeamish about expressing support for any particular government proposal, especially when it involves agreeing to buy government bonds. Tragedies have occurred, however, when independent central banks let worries about the perception that they were too close to the government prevent them from doing something constructive in times of crisis.
Such passivity led to the prolonged recession in Japan in the 1990s. It was only when the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance abandoned their mutual distrust and worked together publicly in 2002-3 that Japan had a sustained recovery. The same kind of distrust between monetary and fiscal officials, and concerns about being perceived as too close to each other, is bringing the euro area to the brink of disaster today.
Central bank independence is not primarily a matter of reputation, but of reality. What matters is what central banks do, not whether they maintain an appearance of disdain toward the messy realities of economic and political life. The inflation-fighting credibility of central banks is not vulnerable to voluntary purchases of bonds, public or private, made with reference to clear and long-held economic goals. Therefore, if the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank respond to the crisis with available tools, including large-scale bond purchases (as the Bank of England has already begun to do), they will enhance their credibility and independence for the future.
Almost certainly, even if we were to do everything right on monetary policy (and we certainly will not get everything right, despite the best of intentions), some economic suffering will continue. But it is the responsibility and duty of central bankers to make things better if we can.
Central bank officials have wasted too much time over the last year worrying about how their institutions would appear to markets, to politicians and to the public, were they to undertake more stimulus. Sometimes you have to do the right thing even if the benefits take time to become evident. If we do not undertake the monetary stimulus that the grim outlook calls for, then our economies and our people will suffer avoidable and potentially lasting damage.

HEADLINE: Taking First-Class Coddling Above and Beyond

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The gap between first class and coach has never been so wide.
Carriers on international flights are offering private suites for first-class passengers, three-star meals and personal service once found only on corporate jets. They provide massages before takeoff, whisk passengers through special customs lanes and drive them in a private limousine right to the plane. Some have bars. One airline has installed showers onboard.
The amenities in the back of the cabin? Sparse.
So as domestic travelers take to the skies for the holiday season, most will be in cramped cabins, their food is likely to be bland and they will have paid for it, along with any fees for slightly more legroom or checked bags. 
But even as they have cut back on domestic service, including first-class accommodations, the airlines have been engaged in a global battle for top executives and the superwealthy on their international routes. Though only a privileged few can afford to pay $15,000 to fly first class from New York to Singapore or Sydney, the airlines are betting that the image of luxury they project for the front helps attract passengers to the rest of the plane. That includes a growing business-class section with offerings once solely the preserve of first class.
Though first class represents less than 5 percent of all seats flown on long-haul routes, and business class accounts for 15 percent, those seats combined to generate 40 to 50 percent of airlines' revenue, according to Peter Morris, the chief economist at Ascend, an aviation consulting firm.
As a general rule, business class is five to 10 times the price of an economy ticket, while first class is usually twice the price of business. ''First class,'' said Brett Snyder, president of Cranky Concierge, an air travel assistance Web site, ''is status.''
Until the 1980s, first class was roomier than coach, but not all that fancy. The seats in the front offered more legroom but did not recline more than 40 degrees. The food was better in first class too, though even the meals in coach were better than they are now. With globalization, particularly the rise of Asia, passengers began demanding more from first class, especially with new planes that could fly much longer routes without stopping.
Airlines have expanded their focus -- which had been limited to London, Paris, and New York -- to emerging economic centers like Hong Kong, Shanghai and Dubai. ''Obviously the first-class passenger is a very senior person in his company, coming a long way around the world, and probably doing something very important for his business,'' said John Slosar, the chief executive of Cathay Pacific Airways. ''He requires to be able to sleep, work on his speech, perhaps take a shower upon arrival, so he can hit the ground running.''
British Airways was among the first airlines to change the definition of what first class entailed by offering flat-bed seats in the 1990s on its long-haul routes.
In recent years, the airlines most aggressive in adding luxury touches to first class have come from Asia and the Middle East, among them Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines. Emirates, based in Dubai, came up with personal suites for first-class passengers in 2003 and in 2008 installed two showers on its Airbus A380 planes for them.
European airlines quickly recognized the threat. Air France, for instance, now has a dedicated first-class lounge in Paris with a spa and a restaurant catered by the chef Alain Ducasse. Immigration officers come directly into the lounge to check passports, and passengers are driven to the airplane in a limousine only seconds before the doors shut.
But American carriers were slower to react, largely because they lacked the funds to upgrade their cabins until recently. Now, they have little choice. International rivals are starting to encroach deeper into their domestic markets, beyond New York and Los Angeles. Emirates, for instance, announced it would begin service from Dubai to Dallas and Seattle early next year.
''If you don't refurbish your cabins, then all you are left with is the low-yielding traffic,'' Mr. Morris said. ''It's just not an option.'' First class has also served as a lab for in-flight amenities that eventually trickled down to the rest of the plane. Individual screens are now found in the seatbacks in coach. Lie-flat seats have moved to business class.
In fact, business class has become so comfortable that, in many cases, it can rival first class itself. ''People demand more from the business class than they used to,'' Mr. Snyder said.
That is why some airlines have concluded that the market for first-class passengers is too slim to justify the investments, especially since passengers sitting in the front seats are often upgraded from business class or got their tickets using airline miles.
''A plane is only so big,'' said Jim Compton, the chief revenue officer at United Continental Holdings. ''And the reality is that demand for the product in all markets is not necessarily there.''
After its merger with Continental last year, United Airlines kept its first-class cabin only on some international routes that used to be served by United but not on those flown by Continental. It is also installing new flat-bed seats across its fleet in business class.
Delta Air Lines does not have a first class, just business and coach, and Qatar Airways has no first class in its fleet of Boeing 777s, which serve the United States market. Others have reduced the number of seats in first class. Air France now flies planes with first-class seats to only 28 international cities, out of a network of over 250 destinations.
Lufthansa, for its part, has kept its first class on most flights but has removed half the seats to focus on a more intimate experience on board. In the new A380 aircraft, Lufthansa also installed a system that increases the humidity in the first-class cabin by 25 percent, which the airline says will help ease jetlag. It has also insulated the cabin with special soundproofing material.
''It is our premium product, and our customers were asking for more intimacy, more privacy,'' said Jurgen Siebenrock, Lufthansa's vice president for North and South America. ''If you want to be competitive, you really need to upgrade your product.''
Nothing compares with the experience of flying first class, said Geoffrey Fischer, a 33-year-old social media consultant based in Seattle. Even after his 15-hour flight on Cathay Pacific landed in Hong Kong, he did not want to get off the plane, he said. Throughout the trip, which he also wrote about on the Cranky Flier blog, he was plied with Champagne and wine. He was served caviar as an appetizer on fine bone china and with a linen tablecloth. His seat turned into a full-size bed. He was handed designer pajamas to wear while an attentive flight attendant made up his bed, complete with a pillow, duvet and sheets.
''I've never experienced such a private jet atmosphere,'' said Mr. Fischer, who snagged his seat using frequent flier miles. ''It was the best flight I've ever been on.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about stepped-up amenities in first-class air travel misstated the availability of first class on Qatar Airways. While the carrier's Boeing 777s, which serve the United States market and other destinations, do not offer first class, there is a first-class cabin on some of its planes, including Airbus A340s and some A330s. It is not the case that the airline has no first-class seats.

HEADLINE: For the Rich, Cargo Vans on Steroids

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Steve Kantor admits that he likes to travel in style. He is an affable investment banker, concerned about flaunting his wealth, but he drives around Manhattan in what looks like a simple black delivery van.
Of course, most vans do not have chauffeurs, as Mr. Kantor's has. Or a built-in office, custom installed.
''I have two big-screen televisions; I have a couch in the back that goes into a bed,'' Mr. Kantor said. ''I have four chairs that go back and massage you. It has a desk, a table and an intercom so you can have meetings in there if you want to.'' 
As the economy limps along and more attention is paid to the so-called 1 percent, some of the richest New Yorkers have taken to driving around in vehicles that ooze neither wealth nor privilege. But on the inside, the vans may be as lavishly decorated as the private railroad cars owned by turn-of-the-century industrialists.
Some owners use them as mobile offices, outfitted with fine leather chairs and Persian rugs; vans may also double as a child's playroom on wheels, complete with a built-in vacuum to clean what the children dirty.
And while some owners say they are drawn to the vehicles' vanilla exteriors, their outsize profiles cannot help but draw attention: at more than 22 feet long and nearly 9 feet tall, they look like cargo vans on steroids, their high roof lines dwarfing nearly all that surrounds them on the streets of New York. And that's before the satellite dishes are raised.
They are a striking and sometimes unwelcome counterpoint to other trends seen on city streets, where tiny Smart cars dart around hybrid taxis and traffic lanes once reserved for gas-guzzlers are now for bicycles or pedestrians.
''Using your vehicle as a luxury lounge is just usurping public space for your own private use,'' said Michael Murphy, a spokesman for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that encourages New Yorkers to travel around the city more responsibly. ''Streets are shared space and belong to the community.''
Nonetheless, during morning spin classes at Soul Cycle, the Upper East Side studio, the parking spaces cannot accommodate the Sprinter vans, Range Rovers and Lexus GX470s that are sometimes double-parked. A modified black Mercedes van owned by Philip A. Falcone, the chief of Harbinger Capital Partners, has become a fixture on the Upper East Side, idling by the Michael Kors shop on Madison Avenue.
Jill Kargman, a writer and mother of three who lives on the Upper East Side, said that play dates adhered to a certain pecking order: those that start in one of these ultra-luxury vans are preferable because they can ''just bop into a souped-up bulletproof living room on wheels,'' she said.
The most popular model is made by Mercedes: a stripped-down, basic version of the van, the Sprinter, starts at $41,315; Mr. Kantor's version, which Mercedes-Benz Manhattan arranged to have customized, is fitted with satellite television, a Wi-Fi network and flat-screen monitors, and sells for $189,000. Even that is not quite enough for some New Yorkers, who employ designers to install even pricier custom details that easily drive up the total cost to $500,000.
Daniel Barile, a Mercedes-Benz spokesman, said that because many buyers were going to after-market shops to decorate their van interiors, Mercedes started releasing its own version in early 2010, and sold 8,000 the first year. Mercedes has sold 13,000 this year.
And although the modified Mercedes van is popular in several large cities, Howard Becker, president of Becker Automotive Design in Oxnard, Calif., said New York, with its executives in hedge funds and finance, had become his best market.
Hyde Ryan, a designer who worked with a wealthy New York family on decorating the interior of their Mercedes Sprinter van, said that the family wanted gold-plated fittings for every button that would be pushed. The owner installed a vacuum cleaner so the chauffeur could remove every crumb and grain of sand each time the children stepped out of the van.
The vacuum option could be seen on a recent morning on Park Avenue, when Carmelo Umpierre, a 44-year-old chauffeur, idled the $425,000 van he drives for an executive based in Connecticut. It is nearly impossible to find a parking space for such a large vehicle, so Mr. Umpierre often waits for his boss in illegal spots, and moves when the police come by.
The car's owner declined to be interviewed, saying he did not want to draw attention to himself. But he allowed Mr. Umpierre to display the van's interior: the seats were upholstered with heavily scented leather and a stocked bar had individual lighting for each wine glass and Champagne flute. Mr. Umpierre said he vacuumed the interior every night and covered the custom-designed gray wool rugs with towels when it rained. He said he tried to navigate the van through side streets so gawkers could not peek in when he dropped off his boss.
''He likes to be private,'' Mr. Umpierre said of his employer. ''He doesn't like to be dropped off in the front.''
On Friday, Martin Brass, a 43-year-old former Wall Street executive turned investor, was shopping for a Mercedes Sprinter at a Manhattan dealership. Mr. Brass, whose work-related travel often finds him in New York or Hawaii, said he planned to buy a basic model and then have some after-market improvements made to the interior.
Mr. Brass did not so much want to be bathed in luxury, he said; he simply wanted to ''have meetings and presentations in those vehicles.''
The more luxurious accouterments, he said, were not really part of his style. ''That's New York City,'' he said. ''There are people who have endless amounts of money.''

HEADLINE: Using Taiwan as a Bargaining Chip

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''To Save Our Economy, Ditch Taiwan'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 11):
Paul V. Kane's proposal to abandon Taiwan -- to ''write off the $1.14 trillion of American debt currently held by China in exchange for a deal to end American military assistance and arms sales to Taiwan'' -- is a Faustian deal. 
United States interests in Taiwan range from diplomacy to economics to security.
In terms of diplomacy, Taiwan endeavors to maintain peace and stability across the strait. In the past four years, the relationship between Taiwan and China has greatly improved. Taiwan plays the role of responsible strategic partner and makes a contribution to regional peace in line with American interests.
To assume that China would want to write off American debt in exchange for Taiwan is not only naive wishful thinking but also neglects the most important reality -- Taiwan, the world's 19th-largest economy, is not something that can be ''sold'' as a chip.
Only the 23 million people who have built up a prosperous and democratic society on the island have the right to decide upon any change to the status quo.
A wise country would not, as Mr. Kane suggests, sell friends for shortsighted benefit.
BRIAN SU Director, Press Division Taipei Economic and Cultural Office New York, Nov. 11, 2011
To the Editor:
Paul V. Kane suggests that we negotiate with China to write off American debt in exchange for ending our support for Taiwan, then muses that perhaps ''critics will call this proposal impractical, even absurd.''
Instead, I call it the most shockingly immoral proposal I have ever read in the op-ed pages of any major newspaper. It may perhaps become inevitable to reassess our relationship with an old friend, but we should not enter into ''closed-door negotiations'' with its enemy in order to extract a price of $1.14 trillion for our betrayal of a friend. If we do that, how can anyone trust us in the future?
JUAN BULNES Mountain View, Calif., Nov. 11, 2011
To the Editor:
Apart from the amorality of the argument (would anyone argue that we sacrifice Israel in return for Iran's agreement on nonproliferation?), why would Beijing agree to such a tradeoff? From its point of view, Taiwan's large and growing economic dependence on the People's Republic of China, plus all the other ties that the current Taiwan administration has agreed to, means that unification is more than halfway accomplished.
In this case, China can have its cake, American debt, and eat Taiwan as well.

HEADLINE: Waning Confidence in Political Leadership Threatens U.S. Markets

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Despite one negative headline from Europe after another, the stock market in the United States has held up pretty well lately, rising 10 percent since the beginning of October. But that could change this week, amid mounting investor doubt about the ability of political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to slash spending and control budget deficits.
With deficit reduction talks all but dead in Washington and several bond auctions by fiscally shaky governments on the Continent this week, market specialists say the coming days may well be treacherous, especially if legislators in the United States do not agree on a plan to reduce the deficit. 
That prospect looked increasingly likely. Despite the occasional sharp sell-off in the markets, investors have mostly been hoping for the best. In the United States, that means a blueprint for savings and a respite from wrangling over government spending, while in Europe the hope is that the European Central Bank will do more to shore up faltering borrowers like Italy and Spain.
But in each case, the likelihood of bad news outweighs the chances of a breakthrough, said Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley's chief United States equity strategist.
''It should make people nervous,'' Mr. Parker said. ''There is a feedback loop between Europe and the rest of the world and that can slow growth. And the political polarization in Washington is also worrisome to investors.''
As trading volume thins before Thanksgiving on Thursday, all these concerns increase the odds of volatility on Wall Street, said Ronald Florance, director for investment strategies at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ''It doesn't take much to have big moves,'' Mr. Florance said. ''It wouldn't surprise me to have 1.5 percent or 2 percent swings in the next few days.''
Stocks closed slightly higher on Friday, after a sharp sell-off earlier in the week caused by rising worries about the impact of surging borrowing costs across Europe. A big bond auction in Spain on Thursday was met with lackluster demand from investors, with yields nearing 7 percent, a record. Meanwhile, yields on Italian bonds also remained stubbornly high, finishing the week at 6.6 percent.
The rising yields increase the likelihood of a recession in Europe, and that could affect some sectors in the United States more than others, said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief equity strategist.
''People should be selectively more nervous,'' Mr. Levkovich said, noting that for the overall Standard & Poor's 500-stock group of companies, only 9 percent of revenues come from Europe.
But that figure is much higher for sectors like automakers, with 30 percent of sales tied to Europe, and household and personal products at 17.5 percent and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology at 15.5 percent. Still, many sectors will be barely affected by a deeper European slowdown in terms of revenues, including telecommunications, food staples and retailing, he said.
While yields have been rising across Europe, threatening economic growth there, for the United States the key is to keep the contagion from spreading west and raising rates here.
That has not happened, Mr. Levkovich said. In the months leading to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, he noted, borrowing costs for investment-grade corporations in the United States leaped 2 percent. This time, despite the anxiety abroad, rates for big corporate borrowers have increased by less than 20 basis points, about one-tenth as much as before.
As for the special Congressional panel's effort to find $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts by Wednesday, investors were already discounting the likelihood of a breakthrough. If the committee cannot agree on a plan by then, which seemed to be a near certainty on Sunday, the $1.2 trillion in cuts over 10 years are supposed to take effect automatically beginning in January 2013, with deep reductions in the Pentagon's budget and domestic programs.
The markets will also be weighing the implications of elections in Spain on Sunday. With nearly all of the votes counted, the opposition Popular Party appeared to have won a governing majority. Because the Popular Party is more likely to impose the austerity measures investors want, that may propel markets, some analysts said. But any push probably would be fleeting because the bigger questions hanging over the euro remain unresolved.
European economic figures to be published this week, including industrial production and purchasing managers' data, are likely to show a worsening picture, with activity hit by the crisis and rising market interest rates, economists said.
In contrast, statistics to be published this week in the United States will show a strengthening economy, and are likely to support the United States stock market. What is more, unlike in Europe, where government bonds have been pummeled, in the United States Treasury bonds have continued to be a haven for investors seeking a safe harbor amid uncertainty elsewhere.
''The balance of the economic data flow out of Europe is going to be more negative,'' said Eric Green, economist at TD Securities in New York. ''In the United States, it is going to be fairly positive.''
Last week, Mr. Green increased his forecast for annual growth in the United States in the fourth quarter to 3 percent from a previous estimate of 2 percent.
Wall Street has been fairly resilient recently because of the better economic data, he said. But any worsening of the situation in Europe could drag the American economy and stock market back down, Mr. Green said. ''Whatever momentum we have now could turn around all very quickly because of Europe,'' he said.
Several European bond auctions are scheduled for this week. On Tuesday, the Netherlands will auction three-year bonds, and Spain will auction three-month and six-month treasury bills, Daiwa said. Germany will sell 10-year bonds on Wednesday. In a more important test of investor confidence, Italy will auction treasury bills on Friday.
For now, said Eric Fine, managing director of Van Eck G-175 Strategies in New York, investors are still counting on an imminent move by the European Central Bank to stand behind the debt of weaker European borrowers, though Germany has consistently opposed that.
''The market is reflecting a very high probability of a save by the E.C.B.,'' he said. ''But that probability is nowhere near as high as the market thinks.''

HEADLINE: Don't Overlook Electricity's Power

BYLINE: By ROB COX and WEI GU

 BODY:
Northeast Utilities made an offering at the altar of the regulatory gods last week. The utility parted ways with the executive who had headed its biggest division, Connecticut Light & Power, over its poor handling of two storms that left millions of customers without power for weeks. Investors seem to think that will smooth approval for a $4.7 billion takeover of Nstar, its rival. Their optimism looks misplaced.
In an interview with Breakingviews, Dan Esty, the commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said the state was determined to insert itself into the merger approval process, even if that means introducing and fast-tracking special legislation. 
''There are important questions that need to be vetted for the people of Connecticut'' before this deal is approved, he said. ''The state needs to know how the merger will impact ratepayers and what lines of accountability will be drawn.''
That's a stark change from the state's earlier line. Connecticut's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority had previously decided it had no jurisdiction over the deal, which was announced a little over a year ago, leaving final approval to utility regulators in Massachusetts. That was before Hurricane Irene and a snowstorm on Halloween weekend left millions of customers of Connecticut Light & Power, Northeast Utilities' primary subsidiary, without power for more than a week.
The subsidiary's planning, response and communications are now the subject of numerous investigations by the state and local authorities. The company failed to meet deadlines for restoring power. On Thursday, Northeast Utilities accepted the resignation of the head of Connecticut Light & Power, Jeffrey D. Butler, who had become the public face of the company's problems. It's easy to see why that news warmed investors' hearts, giving Northeast Utilities shares nearly a 2 percent lift Friday. By removing the man in charge of the bungled performance of its subsidiary, the monopoly can argue that it is accountable to customers and regulators.
But two weeks in the cold and dark have done the seemingly impossible in today's difficult political climate: united state lawmakers on the right and left on a single issue. Connecticut sounds resolute in reopening its right to weigh in on the merger. It would be foolish for investors to ignore the heightened risk to their deal.
China's Little Greeces
China can't afford to be smug about the euro zone's woes. Although the nation's total debt comes to no more than 44 percent of its gross domestic product, China has some overextended regions, so-called Little Greeces, of its own. Hainan Province in the south, for example, has amassed debt close to 100 percent of the province's G.D.P. The new policy of allowing local governments to issue their own bonds may make the problem worse.
High debt levels threaten to choke a fifth of Chinese cities. According to the National Audit Office, as many as 78 cities have debt-to-G.D.P. ratios of more than 100 percent. Hainan Province has the highest debt to G.D.P. ratio, 93 percent. Debt at local governments surged 19 percent in 2010, a result of Beijing's $4 trillion stimulus package.
Beijing recently began a pilot program to allow local governments to issue debt, a sign that they will be expected to take care of their own debt burden. The Shanghai government's auction of $568 million in bonds last week will be followed by similar sales by three governments in rich parts of China.
But the Greek experience shows that excess borrowing can store up trouble. Moreover, at least a third of local government spending, largely infrastructure, falls outside the budget and is paid through bank loans and land sales, which have dropped recently.
Local governments can sell shares in companies, or privatize bridges and highways to help reduce debt. The Shanghai municipal government had $218 billion in assets in companies and infrastructure projects at the end of 2010, close to 87 percent of its G.D.P. Even the Hainan local government has $23 billion worth of assets, about 75 percent of G.D.P. China's Little Greeces have the assets to meet their liabilities, but they may need to start monetizing them before European-style panic kicks them into any fire sales.

HEADLINE: Ethiopian Troops Said to Enter Somalia, Opening New Front Against Militants

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Mohamed Ibrahim contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia.

 BODY:
NAIROBI, Kenya -- Witnesses along the drought-stricken Ethiopia-Somalia border reported Sunday that hundreds of Ethiopian troops had crossed into Somalia with armored personnel carriers, heavy artillery and tanks, opening a new front in an intensifying international offensive against the Shabab militant group.
The Islamist insurgents of the Shabab are already battling Kenyan forces in southern Somalia and African Union peacekeepers in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. So far the reaction among Somalis, though, has been the polar opposite of what happened a few years ago, when Ethiopian troops invaded Somalia in 2006 and occupied the country for about two years, turning the population against them and fueling the rise of the Shabab. 
This time, many Somalis say they welcome anyone who can get the Shabab out, even their historic enemy, the Ethiopians.
''What we need right now is only peace, and we don't care about the identity of the peacemakers,'' said Abdulle Ismail, a resident in the town of Guriel.
The Shabab have been terrorizing much of Somalia for years, instituting a harsh form of Islamic law in the territory they control and blocking Western aid groups from working in their areas during a time of famine. But the Shabab are now stretched very thin, with three of their major strongholds in the cross hairs of opposing forces.
African Union peacekeepers have been hammering the neighborhood of Deynile, the last Shabab outpost in Mogadishu, for weeks. Kenyan forces are slowly but steadily advancing toward the port of Kismaayo, a source of millions of dollars of port fees for the Shabab and possibly their most strategically important town. And now it appears that the Ethiopians are headed to Baidoa, a large town home to hundreds of Shabab fighters not far from the Ethiopian border.
The injection of Ethiopian troops is a risky move, Western officials say, because of the historic enmity between Ethiopia, a Christian-led nation, and Somalia, which is almost purely Muslim. The neighbors have clashed repeatedly since Somalia became independent in 1960, and in 2006, Ethiopian forces ousted an Islamist movement that controlled much of southern Somalia.
Last week, African Union officials said they were considering adding Ethiopian troops to the 9,000 peacekeepers in Somalia, who have taken heavy casualties recently.
But the American government, a close ally of Ethiopia, seems divided over the wisdom of this. Some diplomats in the State Department are strongly against the Ethiopians jumping into Somalia again, said one American official, while the Pentagon and the C.I.A. seem to support it.
''The feeling is that the Ethiopians have the muscle, and the Kenyans don't,'' said the American official, who spoke anonymously because of the delicacy of the topic. ''But it would be much better for the Ethiopians to back these operations discreetly, maybe with air power and logistics, and not to storm in.''
Though Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries on earth, it boasts one of the largest armies in Africa.
In Washington, military and intelligence officials were monitoring the news media reports about the Ethiopian incursion but could not independently verify the offensive. A senior Defense Department official said it was too soon to tell whether the Ethiopian military action would weaken the Shabab further or hand the insurgents a propaganda boost.
A senior official with Somalia's transitional government, a weak and unpopular entity that survives purely on outside support, said last week that Somalia's president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, did not want Ethiopian troops inside Somalia, but that he was powerless to oppose them.
Residents in impoverished villages along the Ethiopia-Somalia border said Sunday that in the past 24 hours, about 800 Ethiopian troops crossed into Somalia, towing heavy weaponry, and that they had begun to build small bases and work with a local militia.
''Brother, let the Ethiopians come because when the drought engulfed us, the Shabab prevented all kinds of assistance from reaching us,'' said Leelo Ahmed, a mother of four children, living in the town of Beledweyne.
According to news services, Ethiopian officials publicly denied that any Ethiopian troops had entered Somalia, though some officials privately acknowledged that this was the case.
Kenya and Ethiopia blame Somalia's instability for hampering their own economic development, and both countries consider the Shabab, who have pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda, to be a regional threat. Yet analysts say the countries may have ulterior motives and are intervening in Somalia to install their own proxy forces who will then serve the interests of Kenya and Ethiopia.
Analysts say the key to whether the Ethiopian incursion will work depends on how long the Ethiopians stay -- and what exactly they do.
''As long as the army acts with some restraint, and as long as the U.S. is careful not to back the incursion (or give the appearance of backing it), the blowback in the central regions would probably be quite limited,'' said Bronwyn E. Bruton, a democracy and governance expert who wrote a provocative essay published by the Council on Foreign Relations urging the West to withdraw from Somalia.
She added that had the Ethiopians avoided a ''stupid two-year occupation of Mogadishu'' in 2007 and 2008, the Shabab would not have been able to capitalize on the anti-Ethiopian feelings and go on to seize power in many parts of the country.

HEADLINE: Occupy Honolulu

 BODY:
Wall Street and Oakland get all the attention, but there's an Occupy Honolulu, too. Its tents and lawn chairs have taken over Thomas Square, a green expanse downtown all set about with banyan trees. 
You can tell it's an occupation from the signs and T-shirts. Otherwise the protesters would blend right in. In Hawaii, where street homelessness is an urgent, unsolved problem, occupying the outdoors is a way of life. The tents in Ala Moana Beach Park were swept out of sight for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last week. Some of them were back by Wednesday.
People are living on beach parks, in the shadow of high-rise hotels, in cars and boxes in the business districts. In forests and under highways and bridges. Six people were sleeping one recent morning in the doorway of Kailua Public Library, next to the police station.
Hawaii has one of the worst homeless rates in the nation, behind Nevada and Oregon. The causes are many, including an absurdly tight housing market and a rampaging methamphetamine problem.
Hawaii doesn't lack for ineffective plans. The last governor put one out after seeing a man living in a tree across the street from her mansion. The new governor's plan has been criticized for directives -- don't feed them! -- that seem harsh and don't do enough to fix root causes.
The divide in Hawaii between haves and have-nots is grotesque. So is the reluctance to challenge it. A Hawaiian musician, Makana, recently got a chance and blew it. He was invited to play at an APEC dinner, where he quietly sang a protest song, ''We Are the Many,'' for 45 minutes. Too quietly: world leaders, including President Obama, kept chatting and chewing, undisturbed.

HEADLINE: President Hits His Stride on Foreign, but Familiar, Territory

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
BALI, Indonesia -- President Obama had more than the usual spring in his step on Saturday as he bounded up the stairs into Air Force One for a 25-hour flight home after an eight-day Pacific spin.
Certainly much of that buoyancy reflected his sense of diplomatic success, so far removed from the dead-end dysfunction waiting in Washington. The president, as his advisers saw it, had re-established the United States' place as a Pacific power after a decade of distraction in the Middle East, convinced allies in Asia and Australia that the United States would, indeed, be a check on China's economic and military might, and helped throw Chinese leaders on the defensive.
But the president's pleasure was personal, too. Each stop -- Hawaii, Australia and Indonesia -- took him to places he had known as a child and young man.
As he said repeatedly, and again on departing, he had taken ''a trip down memory lane.'' 
The Spirit of Home
In Hawaii, Mr. Obama publicly reveled in playing host to 20 presidents and prime ministers at a trade summit meeting in the city, Honolulu, where he was born and spent much of his youth until college -- and where, as he wrote in his memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' he had grappled with his mixed-race heritage and life as an African-American in a population of Caucasians, Pacific Islanders and Asian-Americans.
Both in opening the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to be held in the United States since 1993, and in toasting the leaders at a torch-lit luau, Mr. Obama explained why he had chosen his birthplace for the event. ''I could not imagine a more fitting place,'' he said during his toast.
''Here, we are literally in the center of the Pacific,'' he added. ''Here, we're reminded of the progress that's possible when people of different backgrounds and beliefs come together. This is the most diverse state in our nation, home to so many races and immigrants and Americans who trace their roots back to many of your countries.''
And ''the spirit of Hawaii,'' he said, is ''what made me who I am.''
The first lady, Michelle Obama, echoed her husband in welcoming the leaders' spouses at a luncheon. ''Ever since I first met Barack, he's always talked about how growing up here, in this place, has shaped his character and his perspective,'' she said. ''And it's true. He is a very calm, focused individual, and much of that comes from his upbringing here and the connection to the community here as well.''
Once the summit meeting ended, Mr. Obama told local supporters at a fund-raiser, ''It is good to be home.''
The crowd, as he noted, included a friend of his parents during their short-lived marriage, Gov. Neil Abercrombie; former classmates and a teacher from the private school, Punahou, he attended on scholarships through high school; and a supporter who conveyed ''greetings from a guy who went to Kamehameha'' -- a rival school -- ''who said he blocked my shot into the bleachers.''
Mr. Obama also joked about his roots at an earlier forum with corporate executives, taking aim at the so-called birthers who doubt he was born in the United States and therefore believe he should not be president.
''As many of you know, this is my birthplace. I know that was contested for a while,'' he said, to laughter and applause. ''But I can actually show you the hospital if you want to go down there.''
Language Lessons
In Australia, Mr. Obama's visit was his first as president; twice he had to cancel trips because of domestic demands. But as he reminded Australians at every chance, he had fond memories of coming twice as a child.
At a joint news conference with Prime Minister Julia Gillard in Canberra, the capital, Mr. Obama recalled: ''I've never forgotten the warmth and kindness that the Australian people extended to me when I was 6 and 8. And I can see that the Australian people have lost none of that warmth.''
In a speech to Parliament, he joked, ''As an 8-year-old, I couldn't always understand your foreign language,'' but, he added, ''to a young American boy, Australia and its people -- your optimism, your easygoing ways, your irreverent sense of humor -- all felt so familiar. It felt like home. I've always wanted to return.''
At a dinner for Mr. Obama with Australia's elite, Ms. Gillard said he was popular with Australians because he embodied ''the American dream of opportunity,'' and because he drew from his upbringing ''a worldview that looks outwards rather than inwards, a state of mind that is inclusive rather than exclusive.''
From Canberra across the continent to Darwin, which will be the base for the expanded American military presence that Mr. Obama announced, the president sought laughs by salting his remarks with ''the Strine language,'' including expressions like ''G'die,'' ''give it a burl'' (a try), ''a real chinwag'' (discussion) and ''ear-bashing'' (argument).
Telling Australian soldiers in Darwin, ''I know that you all have a great Australian cheer,'' Mr. Obama added, ''so let me say first, Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!''
He pronounced it correctly: ''Auzzy.''
Signs of Change
In Indonesia for the East Asia Summit meeting on regional security and political issues, Mr. Obama returned to the tropical island, Bali, where he had retreated in 1993 to write his memoir. As a boy, from 6 to 10 years old, he had lived in the capital, Jakarta, while his mother worked for a Ford Foundation program.
''Let me say the obvious: It is wonderful to be back in Bali,'' he said before a private talk with the meeting's host, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia. He added: ''I have to say, 18 years ago, this entire development did not exist. So it's a sign of the remarkable development that has taken place here.''
The language also seemed no longer so familiar to him.
He had begun by saying ''Selamat malam.'' The White House translated that as ''good evening.'' But American Embassy staff members said it literally means ''good night'' -- a greeting of departure, not arrival.

HEADLINE: Fixing Medicare

 BODY:
There is no way to wrestle down the deficit without reining in Medicare costs. Ensuring that the program provides quality health care coverage to millions of older and disabled Americans is essential. These goals are not incompatible, but they require a judicious approach to policy making that is depressingly absent in Washington.
Medicare is nothing less than a lifeline for 49 million older and disabled Americans. It helps pay for care in a wide range of settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient clinics, doctors' offices, hospices and at home, as well as for prescription drugs. 
It is also hugely costly. The federal government spent about $477 billion in net Medicare outlays in fiscal year 2011 -- 13 percent of its total spending. By 2021, it is projected to spend $864 billion -- or 16 percent of the total -- according to figures derived by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That rate of growth is not sustainable indefinitely.
Unfortunately, many politicians seem less interested in coming up with ways to fix Medicare than in how they might impose their ideology on the program or leverage the issue for their next political campaign. Members of both parties need to define more clearly for the public what Medicare's true problems are and how they propose to address them. Here are some of the major issues:
NEAR-TERM COSTS There are three key drivers of Medicare spending: the spiraling cost of all health care as new technologies and treatments are developed; much greater use of medical services by the typical beneficiary; and an aging population. By 2020, the number of enrollees will increase to 64 million.
The current rancorous debate in Washington is focused on finding big immediate cuts to slow Medicare spending. We are skeptical that this can be done quickly without wreaking major havoc.
The health care reform law enacted last year calls for cutting more than $400 billion from Medicare over the next decade, primarily by slowing the rate of growth in payments to health care providers and phasing out unjustified subsidies to private Medicare Advantage plans that insure roughly a quarter of all enrollees. Republican leaders, who denounced those cuts in 2010, have since embraced Representative Paul Ryan's proposal, which adopts virtually all of the same reductions. Even these will be difficult to achieve without driving out providers, according to the government's nonpartisan budget analysts.
There is time to get this right. Since January 2010 the growth in Medicare spending has actually slowed to an annual rate of about 4 percent, less than half the annual rate for the previous decade. No one is quite sure why, but one theory holds that hospitals are scrambling to squeeze a lot of fat out of the system even before the health care reforms pressure them to do it.
LONGER-TERM SAVINGS The only way to make Medicare sustainable is to have it grow at the same rate as the economy that provides the tax base to support it. In recent years, Medicare spending has been growing faster than gross domestic product, by roughly 1.7 to 2 percentage points.
Policy experts of varied political stripes have proposed a host of ways to eliminate excess spending without harming beneficiaries or the medical system. Some would charge higher Medicare premiums for those able to afford them, or raise the age of eligibility, or increase cost-sharing by beneficiaries to deter unnecessary use of medical care. All such proposals have strengths and weaknesses that need to be carefully analyzed.
A more radical proposal, championed primarily by Republicans, is to stop providing Medicare payments for specified benefits no matter the cost and instead give beneficiaries a set amount of money to buy private insurance policies that might not provide the same benefits. These so-called premium-support or voucher plans come in many flavors -- some good, some bad -- and would need to be carefully vetted. The most extreme version, proposed by Representative Ryan, would save the federal government a lot of money mainly by shifting big costs to beneficiaries and driving up costs for the rest of the health care system.
FEE-FOR-SERVICE Experts across the political spectrum agree that Medicare's system for paying health care providers is a big part of its spending problem. The traditional Medicare program pays doctors separate fees for each of 7,000 different services, such as a diagnostic test, office visit or surgical procedure. This encourages excess use of medical tests and procedures because the doctors get more income as their services proliferate and the patient has little reason to question whether another M.R.I. so soon after the last one is really necessary.
The solution, most experts agree, is to have Medicare pay doctors and other health care providers fixed sums to manage a patient's care and then let the doctors decide which services are truly necessary. Close monitoring would be needed to ensure that doctors don't deny medically important services to improve their bottom lines.
The reform law is making a start with pilot programs and modest changes in payment policies to encourage coordinated care management. More vigorous action is needed. This can be done by strengthening provisions in the reform law (unless the Republicans succeed in repealing it) or by adding additional measures that gain bipartisan approval.
BENEFITS Medicare reform should not just be about saving money. Medicare's coverage has some glaring gaps that need fixing. There is no provision for long-term care in nursing homes or at home, forcing many middle-class people to impoverish themselves to qualify for Medicaid. And patients can be socked with very high or very low rates of cost-sharing depending on whether care is delivered in a hospital, nursing home, by a doctor or at home. This crazy-quilt pattern confuses patients about the costs they will have to pay and almost certainly complicates and drives up the costs of administering the program.
At this point, the supercommittee looks close to implosion. But the last time Washington tried for a quick fix of Medicare, in 1997, it did not turn out well. Congress devised a flawed formula that was supposed to hold down payments to doctors. Instead, many doctors simply expanded the number of services delivered to keep their incomes high, while Congress -- after being lobbied -- has postponed the payment cuts year after year. To catch up with the formula, Congress would have to cut physician reimbursements by 29 percent next year. That obviously shouldn't happen and won't.
That cautionary tale is in no way an argument for inaction. It is an argument for serious, unhurried analysis in a less polarized climate. That is the only way to fix this vital program.

HEADLINE: The Debt Deal That Wasn't: A Bit of Hope, Quickly Dashed

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ROBERT PEAR; Elisabeth Bumiller and Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The one sliver of real hope came a week ago, in the darkened Capitol on the Sunday night after Veterans Day.
Called away from dinner tables, the Jets-Patriots game on television and, in one case, a soccer team party, several Democratic members of the special Congressional committee on deficit reduction raced to the office of Senator Patty Murray for a hasty 8:30 meeting to discuss the outlines of a potential agreement. Crucially, it appeared to have the backing of at least one Republican on the 12-member panel even though it included a tax increase.
As the members spoke, they began to see the outlines of a deal, tentatively agreeing on tax rates, revenues, spending cuts and changes to Social Security and Medicare, according to interviews with members of the committee and their aides.
Whether the committee could reach the finish line was very much in question, but at least it was in sight, for the first time in the nine weeks the group had been meeting. 
It disappeared almost as quickly.
On Sunday, just one week after both sides had begun to feel hope, several members of the bipartisan panel conceded that their weeks of negotiations had failed. In the end the two sides could not agree on a mix of tax increases and spending cuts and -- perhaps above all -- on the fate of the tax cuts originally signed by President George W. Bush, which are now scheduled to expire at the end of 2012.
While the panel's failure was in many ways foretold -- President Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, failed to reach a similar deal only this past summer -- the deadlock offers fresh evidence for everyone frustrated with Congress, including its own members.
''It was a huge opportunity missed,'' Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democratic member of the committee, said in an interview on Sunday. Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, who headed the committee with Mrs. Murray, of Washington, agreed. ''As a nation,'' he said, ''I am not sure how long we have to put America on a sustainable path.''
Democrats and Republicans, as has been their wont throughout the process, could not even agree on what led the talks to slide into failure.
Democrats insist that they were closing in on the framework of an agreement, but that Republicans backed away from their willingness to accept significant revenue increases in exchange for cuts in the growth of entitlement programs. They said Mr. Boehner sealed the fate of the panel on Thursday by offering a package that had a mere $3 billion in new revenue, far less than an earlier Republican plan.
Republicans, who agreed that there was a potential framework a week ago, counter that the deal was spoiled by Democrats, who refused to lock in the level of entitlement savings or tax changes they would accept, and began to demand more revenues to match any substantive entitlement changes. Democrats also would not agree to a framework for tax reform, Republicans said.
''There were good talks on Sunday,'' an aide to a Republican panel member said, referring to the Veterans Day weekend meeting. ''We felt that by Monday Democrats collectively had moved the goal posts.''
Further, Republicans argue, Democrats were never really committed to a plan, as evidenced by Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who predicted two weeks ago that the panel would fail to reach an agreement.
The members of the committee began the process with equal parts skepticism and hope. Many lawmakers had tried and failed to reach bipartisan agreements on the same issues over the last few years. They hoped that this time, with the threat of large cuts looming in the event of their failure, would be different.
Members of the panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, spent most of September and early October getting to know one another, and putting together staff. Meetings were largely friendly, with one member bringing beef jerky, another salads from a fancy take-out place near Capitol Hill. On Senator Murray's birthday, there were frosted cupcakes.
Republicans met or spoke by phone twice a day from almost Day 1. Democrats were not as tightly organized.
Serious negotiations did not begin until Oct. 25, when Democrats offered a proposal to reduce deficits by $3 trillion over 10 years through a combination of spending cuts and $1.3 trillion of revenue, largely from tax increases.
The Democratic proposal included as much as $500 billion of savings in health care programs, higher Medicare premiums for high-income beneficiaries and use of a less generous measure of inflation that would reduce annual cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security benefits.
A day later Republicans on the committee rejected the Democratic offer and came back with a proposal that would reduce deficits by $2.2 trillion and that included $640 billion of nontax revenue that Democrats said was too modest. Things were not looking good.
The committee held its last public hearing on Nov. 1. Among the witnesses was Erskine B. Bowles, the co-chairman of Mr. Obama's fiscal commission, who presciently told the Congressional panel, ''I am worried you're going to fail -- fail the country.''
Many side conversations were held between members of every possible combination of party and chamber. But when it came down to specifics, especially on taxes, they sputtered.
Democrats felt particularly aggrieved by Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Senate Republican, citing him as the main obstacle to an agreement. Democrats spoke of Mr. Kyl as if he were an angry father arriving home to realize the children were having a party, and shutting the whole thing down. ''While Kyl is in the group, it sure seems that nothing will happen,'' said a Democrat close to the negotiations.
Republicans were offended by what they felt were numerous partisan public comments by two Democrats on the committee, Representative Xavier Becerra of California and Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, who, they said, were rarely in the room when serious negotiations were occurring.
A potential breakthrough occurred in a meeting in the Capitol late on the night of Nov. 7, when Republicans, led by Mr. Toomey, offered a $1.2 trillion package that included $300 billion of new tax revenue, It was the first time Republicans had shown themselves open to significant amounts of new taxes.
But as Democrats studied the proposal, they found much to criticize. The proposal would have permanently reduced tax rates for all taxpayers, and Democrats objected, in particular, to lowering the rates paid by the most affluent Americans.
This is when the patient seemed to take a turn for the worse.
In the eyes of Republicans, when Democrats rejected the Toomey plan, saying it would provide a windfall for millionaires and billionaires, little more could be accomplished.
Both sides used remarkably similar language to describe their frustrations. A Democrat involved in the negotiations said: ''We made a reasonable offer and got nothing in return. We got naked in the room. Republicans are standing there in overcoats, hats and gloves and are toasty warm.''
A Republican aide, who believed Mr. Toomey made a good-faith proposal and got nothing from Democrats in return, said a few days later: ''We showed some leg. The Democrats want us to get completely naked.''
On Veterans Day Mr. Obama spoke separately to Mr. Hensarling and Mrs. Murray by phone from Air Force One, as he began an eight-day tour of the Pacific Rim. The president was looking for an update, and to express his hopes they could reach a deal. Call when you have one, he effectively said to both, according to White House aides.
Others began feeling panicked. Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee, had kept a close watch on the panel, made near-daily phone calls to its members and intensified his public statements about dire consequences should the committee fail, causing automatic spending cuts.
By last Thursday Mr. Panetta had made a secret trip to Capitol Hill before heading up to Groton, Conn., for a visit to a submarine plant, and aides said he was in a bad mood on the trip north. In Groton his frustrations with the debt reduction panel seemed to boil over. ''I urge this committee: suck it up,'' Mr. Panetta told employees at Electric Boat. ''Do what's right for the country. That's why we elect people: to govern, not to just survive in office.''
Over on K Street, the mood was equally glum. Lobbyists, it seemed, had more interaction with members of the committee than did many members of Congress. On Thursday, one lobbyist sent an alert to companies waiting for any bit of news. ''The parties,'' it said, ''have stopped talking, and progress is no longer being made.''
The process that has dominated the 112th Congress was well on its way to repeating itself. Mr. Boehner took the Republicans' final offer, for $643 billion of deficit reduction -- about half of the statutory goal of the committee with less new tax revenue than Mr. Toomey's plan -- to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, on Thursday. Mr. Reid rejected it out of hand. The end was near.
By Friday, members were telling their staff members that little could be done to salvage the committee's work, and began to move quickly to blaming one another along partisan lines.
Still, said some members, their work would not be for naught.
''Of those that I worked with, I have greater respect for them than before this process started,'' Mr. Hensarling said. ''Although we butted heads and we are all bitterly disappointed, these were good folks who were working hard. Prior to this thing I could not pick Patty Murray in a lineup, but she was very professional and acted with honor and integrity.''
Maybe others, members said, would pick up where they left off.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Trade Blame As Deficit Talks Crumble

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON; Jackie Calmes, Robert Pear and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the hours ticking away toward a self-imposed deadline, Congressional leaders conceded Sunday that talks on a sweeping deficit agreement were near failure and braced for recriminations over their inability to reach a deal.
The stalemate was the latest sign of partisan deadlock in Washington, which members of both parties do not expect to lift until the 2012 election has clarified which party has the upper hand.
Barring an unexpected turnaround before Monday's deadline, the failure of the special Congressional deficit committee will be the third high-profile effort to fall short of a deal in the last 12 months, including a bipartisan deficit commission and talks last summer between President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner.
By law, the special Congressional committee's inability to reach an agreement will trigger $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts over 10 years to the military and domestic programs, to start in 2013. 
As time wound down to a Monday night deadline for an agreement, Capitol Hill lacked the frenzied negotiation typical of a Congressional race to beat the clock. Instead, many members -- well aware that Congressional approval ratings are near historic lows in polls -- seemed resigned to the fact that Democrats and Republicans remained far apart on major budget issues, especially tax increases on the affluent, which Democrats insist must be part of any deficit solution and which Republicans oppose.
The White House called on the 12 members of the special committee to finish their work, but with no expectation of a breakthrough, the leaders of the committee planned to issue a statement on Monday acknowledging that they had failed to reach an agreement. And lawmakers on the panel, which is evenly divided between the two parties, blamed one another for the failure.
Many outside Washington, including on Wall Street, had low expectations for the committee, and some analysts predicted that the breakdown might not have a major effect on financial markets. But the developments added to the air of uncertainty at a time when the world economy is coping with Europe's debt problems and a sluggish recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Some members of Congress were vowing to pass legislation to repeal the automatic cuts, locked in by the law that raised the debt ceiling in August.
Once they return from their Thanksgiving recess, members of Congress face another set of decisions with the potential to hamstring the economy. A temporary payroll-tax cut for nearly all households and jobless benefits for many long-term unemployed are scheduled to expire at year's end, and many economists predict that growth and hiring will slow further if such measures are not renewed.
On Sunday, in the halls of the Capitol and on television talk shows, Democrats and Republicans offered strikingly different post-mortems for the process.
Democrats blamed the Republicans for their unwillingness to yield on a no-new-taxes pact they signed at the request of a conservative antitax group, arguing that the American public realizes that no grand deal could be reached without a combination of spending cuts and new tax revenue.
''As long as we have some Republican lawmakers who feel more enthralled with a pledge they took to a Republican lobbyist than they do to a pledge to the country to solve the problems, this is going to be hard to do,'' Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and the committee's co-chairwoman, said on CNN's ''State of the Union.''
But Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, the co-chairman, said it was the Democrats' inflexibility that had caused the impasse, particularly when it came to agreeing to major money-saving changes in social programs like Medicare and Social Security.
''Unfortunately, what we haven't seen in these talks from the other side is any Democrats willing to put a proposal on the table that actually solves the problems,'' Mr. Hensarling said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
At the White House, officials made a final effort to spur the committee on to a solution. ''Avoiding accountability and kicking the can down the road is how Washington got into this deficit problem in the first place,'' a White House spokeswoman, Amy Brundage, said in a statement. ''So Congress needs to do its job here and make the kind of tough choices to live within its means that American families make every day.''
The panel's apparent failure has already become a topic in the 2012 presidential campaign. Mitt Romney, speaking in New Hampshire on Sunday, blamed President Obama, saying he should have been more involved in pushing for a deal.
''He hasn't had any role. He's done nothing,'' Mr. Romney said. ''This is another example of failed leadership.''
But another committee member, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said on ''Meet the Press'' that President Obama and White House budget officials ''were asked to be hands off.''
''The Republicans said, 'Don't let Obama come into this, because if he does, it will make it political,' '' Mr. Kerry said, adding, ''They've been intimately involved, but carefully so that they didn't politicize it. I think they did the right thing.''
A deal effectively needs to be reached by Monday night, if the committee is going to approve it by Wednesday, the legal deadline for an agreement before the automated cuts, often referred to by the budget term ''the sequester,'' are supposed to be imposed. Automated cuts would not start until January 2013.
Republicans have already begun plans to reconfigure the automatic cuts because about half would come from the Pentagon; Democrats and Mr. Obama are likely to resist those efforts since some domestic spending programs are exempted from the cuts. As of Sunday evening, aides on Capitol Hill said no meeting among all 12 members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction had been set for Monday.
The focus instead now is mostly on placing blame.
''Members went into this more than hopeful,'' Representative Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland who sat on the panel, said in an interview Sunday. ''The question from Day 1 was whether or not Republicans would be serious about a balanced plan. That was always the question, and the answer at least appears to be no.''
Republicans late last week sent Democrats a proposal to save $643 billion over a decade -- about half the goal. But the proposal was quickly rejected as unacceptable, as the Democrats said it included only a small amount of new revenue.
Stock and bond market experts on Sunday said Wall Street markets likely would not react in a major way on Monday, as the automatic spending cuts still provide an insurance policy that the annual deficit could be curtailed.
''I don't think the markets had a lot of expectation that they would reach a deal,'' said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, a managing director at Barclays Capital. ''What matters far more is what happens in Europe over the next week or two.''
The Democrats said that the refusal of the Republicans on the bipartisan committee to agree to allow tax cuts first passed during the Bush administration to expire at the end of 2012 -- which would be one way to raise new revenue, to match spending cuts the Democrats have agreed to accept -- was to blame.
''If they will give up their insistence on the Bush tax cuts, we can get this done,'' Mr. Kerry said on ''Meet the Press.''
But Republicans countered that with the economy already weak, Congress would do more harm if it agreed to a deal that would significantly increase federal revenue, implying that the package that the Democrats had pushed called for at least $1 trillion in new taxes.
''You can't grow if you raise taxes in the middle of a recession,'' Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, a committee member and the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said, also on ''Meet the Press.''
With failure looming, the focus was increasingly turning to how to perhaps change the mix of automated budget cuts before they take effect in January 2013.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that domestic programs -- including education, transportation and immigration -- would be cut by 7.8 percent in 2013 and that Medicare spending would fall by about 2 percent. The biggest cut would be to defense programs, which would be reduced by about 10 percent.
But several large programs would be exempt from automatic cuts, including Social Security, Medicaid, veterans' benefits and various antipoverty programs, based on the agreement Congress and the White House reached in the summer. This is partly why certain Democrats in recent weeks have become less willing to compromise -- the automated cuts, they concluded, may be better than anything they could negotiate.
Mr. Hensarling and Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, both said they hoped the mix of cuts could be changed to reduce the effect on the military.
Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who is not on the deficit committee but is a spokesman of sorts for the conservative Tea Party groups that have pushed the government to curtail the deficit, argued that even with the spending reductions, the Pentagon's overall budget would still increase, just not as much as expected.''

HEADLINE: Kicking Cans, Budget Woes and Other Risks Down the Road

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Congress's impasse on the budget is reminiscent of paralysis on addressing other looming risks. 

 BODY:
11:26 p.m. | Updated below |
The failure of Congress to take meaningful steps on debt and taxes, yet again, is reminiscent of society's treatment of other looming risks.
The automatic budget cuts, which don't take effect until 2013, are by no means guaranteed and, of course, the structural issues in the budget remain unaddressed. 
[6:42 p.m. | Insert | Isabell Sawhill of the Brookings Institution has produced an excellent breakdown of what's at stake with non-defense spending if the automatic cuts play out (found via Brad Plumer on Ezra Klein's Wonkblog).]
What other looming risks are being largely unaddressed? 
One modest example is the lack of substantial effort to retrofit or replace hundreds of schools in the state of Oregon that engineers have identified as likely or nearly certain to collapse when the next inevitable great earthquake is triggered along the region's Cascadia fault (there are struggles to prepare coastal communities for the inevitable tsunami, as well).
On the global scale, the Congressional pattern of kicking the budget can down the road is paralleled by the lack of concrete results after two decades of climate treaty negotiations. The next round begins on Nov. 28 in Durban, South Africa.
Part of this climate impasse relates to the early stages of human recognition that our growth-centered economic norms are butting up against some global limits -- a point made in Naomi Klein's potent new piece on "Capitalism vs. the Climate" in The Nation. I disagree with her prescription, but agree with much of the diagnosis (more on that down the line).
On a more tractable level, part of the impasse has also come from the longstanding effort to cast human-driven global warming as a conventional pollution problem instead of looking more to the root causes. Just look at the absurd situation (my view) as Australia enacts modest carbon restrictions at home while exporting vast quantities of carbon-rich coal to the world's Asian manufacturing hub to be burned.
In 2008, as I've mentioned before, I asked the Bush administration's climate treaty team if the world would have been better off signing a Framework Convention on [Energy] Technology Change back in 1992 instead of one on climate change. They offered an answer in the telephone news briefing linked in the preceding sentence. My answer is yes.
Back in 2000, Jerry D. Mahlman, a tclongtime climate scientist who had recently retired, summarized the slowly building nature of both the evidence for a substantial greenhouse-gas influence and for impacts this way: "This is going to be incremental forever.
He went on. ''We just don't want to face up to it,'' he said, adding that people do not want to change their lifestyle or the economy ''for the sake of avoiding future costs.''
Consider how many issues that conclusion could be applied to. Sure sounds like a deep-rooted trait.
Do we need to add something to our cognitive, or cultural, toolkit
Binyamin Appelbaum of The Times has filed a fascinating analysis of various ways this budget saga could play out in coming months, including this passage: 
There is still plenty of time for Congress to unlock its self-imposed handcuffs and renounce frugality. Next year's elections also could produce a clear mandate for one party to reduce deficits according to its priorities without any need for compromises. Partisans at both ends of the political spectrum said they welcomed the failure of the current talks as an opportunity to win just such a mandate.
Over the last month, conservatives feared that the committee would settle for cosmetic cuts. They now see an opportunity to secure larger reductions, without tax increases, to encourage faster growth.
Liberals hope the Occupy Wall Street protests have shifted political debate from an overriding focus on the long-term danger posed by the federal deficit toward a focus on unemployment, income inequality and other immediate economic problems. Read the rest.

HEADLINE: A Blow to Pinstripe Aspirations

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The struggling financial industry is laying off workers, and those beginning their careers are bearing the brunt of the job cuts and the inevitable loss of status. 

 BODY:
Earlier this fall, Steve Ferdman celebrated getting a job offer from Credit Suisse in the usual Wall Street fashion. Over expensive oysters and dark rum cocktails at a trendy Manhattan restaurant with his parents, he toasted landing the full-time position after working six months as a consultant without benefits.
A week later, Mr. Ferdman, 28, sat alone at the same place and ordered a gin and tonic to lament getting laid off by the bank, for the second time since 2008. When he told the bartender about his misfortune, his next round was on the house.
 "I did everything right. I came into work every day, I put in long hours, and I still got punched in the face," Mr. Ferdman said. "People shouldn't want to work in this industry anymore."
Being young on Wall Street once meant having it all: style, smarts and too much money to spend wisely. Now, twenty-somethings in the finance industry are losing both cash and cachet.
Three years after the global financial crisis nearly brought Wall Street firms to the brink, the nation's largest banks are again struggling. As profits wane, layoffs have claimed thousands of jobs and those still employed have watched their compensation shrink. These problems are set against the morale-crushing backdrop of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has made a villain of a once-lionized industry.
Much of the burden of Wall Street's latest retrenchment has fallen on young financiers. The number of investment bank and brokerage firm employees between the ages 20 and 34 fell by 25 percent from the third quarter of 2008 to the same period of 2011, a loss of 110,000 jobs from layoffs, attrition and voluntary departures.
By comparison, industry headcount dropped by 17 percent in the same period, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data for New York City provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of staff members over the age of 55 decreased by only 11 percent.
Young financiers have experienced setbacks in the past. Bankers and traders who rushed wide-eyed to Wall Street in the halcyon days of the 1980s were waylaid by the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, known as Black Monday. Then they got pummeled in 2000 by the dot-com collapse and the recession that followed.
But experts say that today's doldrums, unlike previous downturns, are here to stay.
 "A lot of the positions that are being cut right now aren't coming back," said Leslie K. Hild, a vice president with the recruiting firm Right Management. "It's an emotional roller coaster for almost everyone."
The industry's woes have also affected the plans of undergraduate and graduate students at the nation's top colleges.
At Harvard Business School, where a relatively high 39 percent of this year's graduates went into finance, compared to 34 percent last year, there has been a "heck of a lot more anxiety" about next year's hiring season, according to William A. Sahlman, a professor of business administration.
"People used to think of some of these organizations, like a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs, as safe career bets," Professor Sahlman said. "Those firms are not going away, but they're going to hire half the people they hired before."
Several large firms are not recruiting new entry-level analysts for their investment banking divisions this fall, having filled their entire incoming class with last summer's interns. At the University of Pennsylvania, whose Wharton School is the closest thing that exists to a Wall Street farm team, Goldman Sachs canceled its informational session.
The mood is even darker outside the Ivy League. Matthew Slotnick, a senior economics major at Boston College, said that he had sent more than 100 resumes to contacts on Wall Street and received several interviews. But he has not gotten any offers. Mr. Slotnick, who has wanted to work at an investment bank since entering college, is now applying to smaller banks and firms outside of New York.
"People are saying it's sort of a 2007, 2008-type hiring climate," he said. "I haven't given up, but it's a bit depressing."
Any sympathy for Wall Street's huddled masses yearning to get rich should be tempered by the fact that financial sector recessions often deal a soft blow. Laid-off financial workers typically get large severance packages, including the use of outplacement services. During their job hunt, many can draw on substantial savings built off past bonuses, on top of collecting unemployment. 
But for those laid-off Wall Street workers whose golden tickets have vanished, the disillusionment is real.
Sam Meek, 27, who was laid off in September when his Connecticut hedge fund decided to downsize, used to spend $500 on charity dinners and lavish golf outings. Now, it's home-cooked meals and beer on the sofa. Recently, Mr. Meek and his roommate, another unemployed banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his job search, sat together in the kitchen filing for unemployment and drinking a bottle of Champagne.
"I'm scraping by right now," he said.
Mr. Meek, a former Marine, says he is pursuing several job options, including an opportunity to help develop a social network for the military. But he remains reluctant to commit to a new company.
"I'm doing full due diligence," he said.
Older financiers are having problems, too. Ian C. Horowitz, 40, a former equity researcher at Rafferty Capital Markets, was laid off in June when his firm decided to outsource its research division. Mr. Horowitz currently collects $400 a week in unemployment benefits and has been mowing lawns and doing odd jobs around his New Jersey town to support his wife and two children.
Mr. Horowitz, who lived through the downturn of 2001, said that the latest cuts felt different.
"There have been economic moments where things were bad, but you knew the pendulum would swing the other direction," he said. "This is structural. The playing field has changed."
Wall Street's social scene has also changed, thanks to Occupy Wall Street and the fear of reproach from industry outsiders. Today's young bankers no longer brag about their jobs, especially in public. One twenty-something Goldman Sachs employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak on the record, said he now told new acquaintances he worked at a consulting firm.
The mood has darkened so much that even the young Wall Street workers who still have prestigious jobs are considering letting go of the brass ring.
"It's lost its luster," said a former Goldman analyst who left the financial sector this year. The former analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he signed a confidentiality agreement with the firm, said that in addition to losing some of the monetary benefits of their jobs, his friends who remained in finance were suffering from peer envy. "The new status jobs aren't at Goldman Sachs. They're at Google, Apple and Facebook."
For many of the high-achieving, type-A young professionals who end up on Wall Street, being tossed around by an industry in tumult can amount to the first real failure of their lives. Even if the industry recovers, some may not stick around long enough to see their fortunes improve.
"I'm still scratching my head," said a former employee of Nomura, the large Japanese bank, who was laid off on Oct. 1. "I went to the right schools, I know the right people and I'm very good at what I do. But when you have to cut costs, you have to cut costs."
The ex-Nomura employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because a confidentiality clause is attached to her severance package, said she had recently come across a group of Occupy Wall Street protesters in Lower Manhattan. While she said she did not support all their ideals, she could now sympathize with their frustrations about high unemployment and a growing sense of economic hopelessness.
"I'm in the same boat as these guys," she said of the protesters. "I just want to start working."

HEADLINE: At Mercedes-Benz Stand, AMG Muscles In on the Spotlight

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The German automaker's performance subsidiary has been busy tuning various Mercedes products, and its efforts are on display at the 2011 Los Angeles auto show. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - There is plenty of eye candy at the Mercedes-Benz stand during the 2011 Los Angeles auto show, which opened to the public on Nov. 18. But the real treats are to be found mostly under various hoods.
The next-generation Mercedes-Benz ML sport utility vehicle had its global introduction at the Frankfurt show in September, but a higher-performance version from Mercedes's AMG skunk works was unveiled here. The ML63, which goes on sale in February, is equipped with a 518-horsepower V-8, special leather appointments and other luxury amenities intended to justify its price, which should be announced closer to its sale date. An ML550 is also joining the ML350 and ML350 BlueTec early next year.
The Black Series C63 AMG coupe is equipped with a 510-horsepower V-8, making it the most powerful C-class vehicle "of all time," the automaker said.
Also making its North American debut in Los Angeles was the 2012 SLS AMG roadster, the convertible version of the SLS AMG gull-wing coupe. The roadster, of course, has nothing upon which to fasten the tops of the coupe's gullwing doors, so it comes with conventionally hinged doors. In a neat design trick, the folding fabric roof stows in 11 seconds, the company said, without taking up any of the trunk's space. All this ingenuity nudges up against $200,000.
Of special note is the new SLK55 AMG roadster, the first AMG version of the SLK, which was introduced earlier this year. The SLK350 was reviewed in Sunday's Automobiles section.
Equipped with the first V-8 offered for the SLK, producing 415 horsepower, the SLK55 is presented without irony as the fuel-saving pioneer in the AMG catalog. The naturally aspirated V-8 features AMG's first installation of a cylinder management system, which cuts off four cylinders when the car is being operated at conservative levels. Mercedes said that highway fuel economy could approach as much as 29 m.p.g. City mileage will also benefit from a hybrid-like stop-start system. An admirable footnote, but perhaps not a primary purchase consideration for the buyer who looks askance at the $55,000 SLK350's mere 302 horsepower.

HEADLINE: How Other Countries Do Deficit Reduction

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The International Monetary Fund found that austerity measures around the developed world in the last 30 years relied nearly twice as heavily on spending cuts as they did on tax increases in order to cut deficits. 

 BODY:
As noted in my previous post, today's (failing) deficit "supercommittee" discussions are hardly the first time Congress has engaged in efforts to reduce the deficit. In most of the deals of the last 30 years, tax increases have accounted for a significant portion of deficit reductions.
The same is true across the developed world.
Researchers at the International Monetary Fund have recently put together a comprehensive report on how developed countries have tried to cut deficits in the last three decades.
The study looked only at tax and revenue changes that were passed explicitly to reduce budget deficits, and calculated the total tax increases, spending cuts or both made in each year, as a share of a given country's gross domestic product.
It found that the typical year that a deficit-reduction plan was in effect, tax increases accounted for reductions equal to about 0.37 percent of a country's gross domestic product. Spending cuts accounted for reductions amounting to 0.62 percent of a country's economy. That means spending cuts were about twice as big as tax increases in this group of 17 rich countries.
In the United States, deficit-curbing plans from 1978 to 1998 were about equally reliant on tax increases and spending trims, with each accounting for deficit cuts of about 0.18 percent of America's gross domestic product in the average year that any austerity plan was in effect.
To look at other countries, I suggest checking out the original report. A detailed chronology for each country begins on Page 6. On Pages 86 and 87 you can find a table summarizing all the data, which I've also adapted below (after the jump). Note that the monetary fund researchers decided to exclude the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.

HEADLINE: Protesters Arrested at Bank-Account Closing Will Sue City

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A woman and her fiance were charged with trespassing and resisting arrest while closing her account in a protest against bank fees that was promoted by Occupy Wall Street; they say they were falsely arrested and subjected to excessive force. 

 BODY:
Updated, 4:44 p.m. | On the afternoon of Oct. 15, Heather Carpenter walked into a Citibank branch in Greenwich Village and closed her account as a form of protest against bank fees. 
The closing was part of a campaign promoted by Occupy Wall Street, and as Ms. Carpenter left police officers were arriving at the branch, where about 20 protesters had gathered inside to air grievances against Citibank.
A moment later, as she stood outside the bank at 555 LaGuardia Place with her fiance, Julio Jose Jiminez-Artunduaga, police officers dragged her back inside, videotape footage shows, where she was arrested. 
Mr. Jimenez-Artunduaga was dragged into the bank and arrested also, photographs and video show. 
They were both charged with resisting arrest and trespassing, said their lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby. Mr. Kuby said that the Manhattan District attorney's office had announced its intention to dismiss the charges against them.
But Ms. Carpenter and her fiance are fighting back. On Monday, they filed suit against the city; the chief of the department for the New York Police Department, Joseph J. Esposito; and four unnamed officers. 
The suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, asserts that the police falsely arrested Ms. Carpenter and Mr. Jimenez-Artunduaga and used excessive force against them in violation of their rights under the Fourth and 14th Amendments.
"The conduct of the defendant officers in restraining, arresting and imprisoning plaintiffs was totally without probable cause and was done maliciously, falsely and in bad faith," the suit states, adding: "It was the defendants who dragged them into the bank - the premises upon which they had allegedly trespassed - to arrest them."
The officers named in the suit, referred to as "police officers John Doe 1-4," participated in the arrests of Ms. Carpenter and Mr. Jimenez-Artunduaga, Mr. Kuby said. Also named is Chief Esposito, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the Police Department, who was present during the arrests and who, the suit said, "failed to remedy the wrongs committed by the police officers."
The head spokesman for the Police Department, Paul J. Browne, said that Ms. Carpenter and Mr. Jimenez-Artunduaga had falsely claimed not to be involved in the protest.
"Both individuals were observed early on disrupting business inside the bank, and then slipping outside as arrests were underway, claiming falsely they were not engaged in the disruption," he wrote in an e-mail. "While still inside the bank, they were told to leave by bank personnel and did not. In fact, the male can be seen on a separate Youtube video videotaping, and at one point going behind the bank's customer service desk to do so." 
The city's Law Department said it would review Ms. Carpenter's suit after it was served with the complaint.
Both of the plaintiffs were held for about 30 hours, the complaint by Mr. Kuby said. Ms. Carpenter's wrists were injured by tight handcuffs and Mr. Jimenez-Artunduaga suffered a lacerated finger said the complaint, which included several photographs and videos.
One video (see above) shows protesters milling inside the bank lobby apparently after being prevented from leaving. As protesters outside watched, the video shows, a man in a dark sweatshirt approached Ms. Carpenter and told her "You were inside." Ms. Carpenter responded "I am a customer" and held up a piece of paper. Then, the man grabbed her and, assisted by several uniformed police officers, forced her back into the bank lobby.
Another video (see above) shows Chief Esposito entering he bank lobby, where the protesters had been held by plainclothed men and announcing that those in the bank were under arrest. A moment later, as several officers forced Mr. Jimenez-Artunduaga into the bank, one protester said "They're dragging them in."
"Don't get involved in it," Chief Esposito replied. "You're a different group."

HEADLINE: This Week In Small Business: Everything Is Super!

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Are your employees absorbed in their work? 

 BODY:
What's affecting my clients, my small business and other small-business owners this week.
The Deficit: We Await the Supercommittee
Lawmakers on the deficit supercommittee continue to haggle before Wednesday's deadline. The president is bracing for failure. Paul Krugman is hoping for failure. Ezra Klein brings together everyone's predictions. Businesses are wary. Jane Wells reports that small businesses will feel defense cuts, saying there will be "a trickle down effect of $2.64 in lost sales in the general economy for every $1 in defense cuts." Steve Pearlstein laments the failure of global leadership.
Red Tape Update: Health Care Goes Supreme
Trish Turner wonders why our tax dollars are subsidizing Scottie Pippen, Ted Turner and Jon Bon Jovi. General Electric pays no taxes on $14 billion in profits. The Supreme Court agrees to hear health care arguments. Anna Yukhananov and Lisa Lambert discuss what the ruling could mean. Gallup says Americans tilt toward favoring repeal. Rob Lynch offers five reasons small businesses shouldn't drop their health care benefits. Karen Klein explains why so few small-business owners are using the health care tax credit.
The Small-Business Economy: Super Saturday 
Global Entrepreneurship Week was introduced in 123 countries last week. American Express is super-sizing this weekend's Small-Business Saturday (and teamed with Google to offer a cool way for businesses to tell their stories). Janine Popick reports that Kim Kardashian is helping small-businesses. Bank of America hires Malcolm Gladwell to speak to small businesses. Michael J. Fox does Johnny B. Goodeagain. A study says that Americans really do like big businesses. The Wall Street Journal announces its most innovative entrepreneur of the year.
The Economy: Structural Shift?
A Federal Reserve report says the chance of recession in 2012 is greater than 50 percent. An updated report (pdf) finds that gross domestic product rose 2.5 percent after rising 1.3 percent in the second quarter. Mark Perry points to a structural shift in the economy: "The Great Recession stimulated huge productivity and efficiency gains as companies shed marginal workers and learned how to do more with less (fewer workers)." Prediction: holiday spending should be about the same as last year (thanks in part to pawn shops!). Scott Grannis has a bunch of charts that show where the economy is heading. Rebecca Black still tops the YouTube charts?
The Data: No Bad Data This Week?
Architecture billing and residential remodeling indexes climb. Industrial production and capacity utilization expand. Machine tool orders surge. Consumer prices and producer prices fall. Retail sales rise and James Picerno is optimistic. But Doug Short says the consumer economy remains in a recession. The United States has the second most efficient labor market.
People: Have You Hired a Veteran?
A report says small-business staffing levels are stable. Sharon Ho gives advice on hiring the right people, and Michael Alter talks about turning them into the right team. Congress approves a tax break for hiring military veterans and Amazon opens its doors. A chief executive explains why he hires vets. A Target employee starts a petition against working on Thanksgiving Day. Darth Vader is promoted to regional director at an electronics chain. Starbucks' campaign to create jobs surpasses $1 million in donations. Google and Apple top a list of the most attractive employers.
Marketing 1: Social Media Stuff
A report finds that 96 percent of small businesses are on Facebook. Mikal E. Belicove says that Google+ is not good for small businesses: "As of this writing, Google+'s reach is .05 percent of total U.S. Internet users online. By comparison, Facebook's reach is 63 percent." Cindy Bates explains how to use Microsoft Bing to promote your business free. A Nielsen survey finds that Indians spend more time on social media than on any other activity on the Internet. Local social media ad spending is expected to hit $2.3 billion in 2015. Jason Keith sums up a bunch of useful social media marketing stats. Here is proof that Americans are still awesome.
Marketing 2: Does Yelp Help?
President Obama and the president of China kiss in a controversial new marketing campaign. MP Mueller reminds us not to forget the clients we already have. Retailers are seeing a split in the behavior of shoppers. Brian Goffman offers 12 marketing predictions for 2012. Amazon goes all out for loyalty. Kara Haas explains how QR codes can help market your services (even if you're not an accountant). Jonathan Farrington explains why qualification is a process, not a single event. Stephanie Elam and Julie Brayton both wonder if Yelp really helps small businesses. Constant Contact finds small businesses are still slow to adopt social media.

The Week's Bests
Explanation for What Really Motivates Small-Business Owners. Neroli Makim sums it up:"Being able to provide a valuable product and service to others whilst enjoying the freedom to explore and express your creativity is an extraordinary motivator. Your creativity is inextricably linked to how autonomous you feel; freedom and creativity go hand in hand. When you work for someone else, you are rarely given free rein to innovate and problem-solve at will. The intrinsic motivation of autonomy drives you in business and the sense of freedom and creativity that comes from it is a great source of fulfillment in itself."
Reason Bad Hires Happen. John Featherstone explains: "Not properly thinking through the problems and requirements of the job, and the related skills and experience needed for a person to be successful. There are no shortcuts here. How can you possibly pick the right person for the job when you haven't clearly identified what kind of qualifications to look for? Proper preparation is critical to a successful hiring project."
Uses of Psychology. Joe Wilner lists five ways positive psychology can help a workplace, including: "Taking an approach of self-determination offers freedom and autonomy for workers to flourish and become absorbed in the work they do best. This involves employees uncovering their signature strengths and having the freedom to use them."
 This Week's Question: Are your employees absorbed in their work?

 BODY:
Theodore Forstmann, Private Equity Pioneer, Is Dead at 71 | Theodore J. Forstmann, a colorful financier and philanthropist who helped pioneer leveraged buyouts, died on Sunday at the age of 71.
The cause was brain cancer, his spokesman said. Mr. Forstmann, who lived in Manhattan had been diagnosed with a malignant glioma earlier this year.
Mr. Forstmann was among the very first executives to use debt to acquire companies, fix them and then sell them for millions - and sometimes billions - of dollars in profits.
Beginning in the late 1970s, he pooled money from wealthy investors and large pension funds to back his acquisitions, while taking 20 percent of the profits, creating a business model that today is known as the private equity industry. He also coined the phrase "barbarians at the gate," which Bryan Burrough and John Helyar used in their 1990 best-selling book about the $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco.

HEADLINE: With MF Global Case Growing, Agency Expands Enforcement

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The C.F.T.C. enforcement chief David Meister plans to create two enforcement "squads" -- one that will examine fraud and manipulation, and the other to take aim at wrongdoing in the swaps market. 

 BODY:
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is setting up specialized enforcement units to expose financial wrongdoing, the agency's enforcement chief said on Monday, an act that coincides with the agency taking a leading role in the investigation of MF Global. 
David Meister, the C.F.T.C. enforcement chief, said he was creating two enforcement "squads," one that will examine fraud and manipulation, and the other to take aim at wrongdoing in the swaps market, a $600 trillion industry at the center of the 2008 financial meltdown. 
The move is part of a broader push to revamp the agency's once-quiet enforcement unit. Under Mr. Meister, a former federal prosecutor and once a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom, the agency brought 99 enforcement actions over the last fiscal year, 74 percent more than the prior year.
Unlike the "cousin who comes at the holidays," Mr. Meister said at a Practising Law Institute event in New York on Monday, "We're here to stay."
In recent weeks, Mr. Meister's team has been consumed with MF Global, the commodities and derivatives brokerage firm once run by Jon S. Corzine. When MF Global collapsed into bankruptcy last month, the firm told regulators that it could not locate $600 million in customer money. On Monday, the court-appointed trustee overseeing the liquidation of MF Global estimated that the shortfall could now exceed $1.2 billion.
In MF Global's final days, the firm improperly diverted the customer cash for its own use, a move that regulators suspect may have caused the money to go missing, according to people briefed on the investigation. Regulators suspect that MF Global used at least some of the funds to cover investment losses, which means the money could be gone forever. 
Wherever the money went, MF Global violated basic commodities laws that require firms to keep their customers' money separate from firm funds. 
"You should know the commission takes the laws on segregated funds very seriously," Mr. Meister said. 
If federal prosecutors determine that MF Global intentionally tapped the customer funds, they could file criminal charges. But Mr. Meister noted that his agency need not show "intent to prove a violation of our law."
The agency's renewed enforcement crackdown could still meet serious obstacles. Lawmakers are looking to keep the agency's budget essentially flat, despite it's heightened authority and responsibility. 
Limited resources are also constraining the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"We're essentially engaged in a triage exercise," George Canellos, the head of the S.E.C.'s New York office, said at the Practising Law Institute event, which was geared to hedge fund enforcement issues. While Congress promised to deliver new resources to regulators following the financial crisis, "so far that's been a false promise," he added.

HEADLINE: At PWC, They Now Have Names

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which regulates the audit profession, seems to have sent a message that it does not like the way firms have been auditing how banks value hard-to-measure financial assets. 

 BODY:
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board today released its annual inspection reports on two of the Big Four: KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. They are the first to come out this year. The reports on Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche will presumably follow.
One virtually identical criticism of the two firms could be a sign of the way all the firms have been auditing how banks value hard-to-measure financial assets. 
"In three of these audits," the board wrote in its report on KPMG's audits done in 2010, "for certain financial instruments the firm obtained multiple prices and used the price closest to the issuer's recorded price in testing its fair value measurements, without evaluating the significance of differences between the other prices obtained and the issuer's prices."
The report on PWC was similar, except it noted four audits with the problem.
Thus the board is rejecting what may be a common method of auditing bank valuations. It appears the firms contacted several sources for price estimates, and assumed all the replies they got were reasonable. Then they set out to see if the firm had come acceptably close to any of them. If so, the value was deemed acceptable.
That means that the auditor could accept wildly divergent values of the same asset in differing audits. In essence, the board is saying that the auditors have to look at all the evidence on valuations, and be prepared to explain why they concluded the company's choice was reasonable in the light of any evidence it was not. 
Let's hope the auditors take that to heart when the audit season begins in a few weeks.
Each report includes a response from the audit firm, as is required. The response from PWC this time breaks welcome new ground. It is signed by real people: Bob Moritz, the firm's United States chairman, and Tim Ryan, the United States assurance leader. In the past, these letters - like audit reports signed by the firms - never mentioned a name. So it was impossible to even know if top management of the firm had approved the response. In this case, top management signed it.
The letter itself also was refreshing. Normally these letters say something like what KPMG wrote:
"We conducted a thorough evaluation of the matters identified in the draft report and addressed the engagement-specific findings in a manner consistent with PCAOB auditing standards and KPMG policies and procedures."
You may note that said nothing about whether the firm accepted the board's conclusions or not. That is better than what Deloitte did a few years ago, when it essentially said the board did not know what it was talking about. (I wrote about that last month in a column you can find here.)
PWC's letter addressed that issue, saying that while there were cases where it differed with the board's conclusions, "they generally related to the significance of the finding in relation to the audit taken as a whole, and not to the substance of the finding."
"Accordingly," wrote the PWC officials, "the overall PCAOB inspection results, as well as the results of our internal inspections, were important considerations in formulating our quality improvement plan," which it then describes. So the letter indicates the firm admits it could have done better and lays out steps it is taking to improve.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Failure

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Now that the super committee has deadlocked, Congress will try to wriggle out of the automatic cuts. 

 BODY:
As I read the background story on the collapse of the "super committee" talks in the Times today, I felt depressed. It's not like I wasn't prepared for this: The committee's membership and rules seemed certain to produce a stalemate.
But it was still disheartening to read how the Republicans organized themselves to produce a series of ever-smaller cuts to the deficit (interesting considering they claim to be the big deficit hawks on campus) and ever-smaller tax increases. By the time things finally unraveled on Sunday, the GOP was down to about $643 billion in deficit reduction (compared to the Democrats' initial offer of about $3 trillion over 10 years) and offered less than $3 billion in new revenue.
Now that's bold thinking - assuming your goal is to keep the economy as weak as possible until Election Day 2012.
Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who co-chaired the committee with Senator Patty Murray of Washington, unwittingly underscored how tragically dysfunctional Washington is these days when he said that prior to the committee's meetings he had no idea who Ms. Murray was. She's only been a senator since 1992.
So what now? The rules say that if the super committee does not agree on a package of spending cuts and revenue increases, then across the board spending cuts will be imposed on all government agencies - including Medicare (supposedly to inspire Democrats to make concessions) and military spending (supposedly to inspire Republicans to do the same).
Across-the-board cuts are a truly horrible idea. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was so wigged out at the prospect that he spent the last few weeks trying to persuade committee members in private to do their jobs, rather than jockeying for position over their inevitable failure to do so.
The only good news about the committee's failure is that the automatic across-the-board cuts (called sequestration) may not be automatic at all. They're very possibly a gimmick, like the committee itself.
Writing in The New Republic last week, Timothy Noah pointed out that Congress has managed to circumvent prior attempts to compel spending cuts, starting with the Gramm-Rudman act of 1985, which "introduced sequestration as a fallback if annual deficit-reduction targets weren't met." Congress realized it could just ignore both requirements, and by the time Gramm-Rudman was scrapped in 1990, Congress had increased the deficit by $8 billion. That was under Ronald Reagan.
This time, Mr. Noah points out, sequestration won't kick in until 2013, which is of course after the next election. By then, the entire Washington political calculus will have changed.
If President Obama wins re-election and the Democrats improve their situation in Congress, perhaps they will finally find the political guts to stand up to the Republicans. If Mr. Obama loses, get ready for draconian cuts in the programs that keep America's promise to the poor and the elderly. Think income inequality is a problem now?
The answer to the deficit has been obvious from the beginning. Government spending needs to be reduced. But taxes need to go up, especially on the richest Americans, who also happen to have been the chief beneficiaries of the recent deficit-spending spree.
President George W. Bush's tax cuts are one of the principal reasons why the deficit is so huge right now (along with Congress's irresponsible decision to let him finance two wars off the books). We cannot cut our way back to economic prosperity. It's never worked before. It won't work now.

HEADLINE: President Obama Signs Veterans Tax Credit Bill

BYLINE: JAMES DAO


HIGHLIGHT: If anyone doubted that veterans remain potent political symbols, they need look no further than Congress's ability to set aside partisan gridlock last week and overwhelmingly enact legislation providing tax credits to businesses that hire veterans. Flanked by veterans advocates, President Obama signed the "VOW to Hire Heroes Act" into law this morning. 

 BODY:
If anyone doubted that veterans remain potent political symbols, they need look no further than Congress's ability to set aside partisan gridlock last week and overwhelmingly enact legislation providing tax credits to businesses that hire veterans. Flanked by veterans advocates, President Obama signed the bill into law this morning.
The "VOW to Hire Heroes Act" will provide tax credits of up to $2,400 for employers who hire veterans who have been unemployed at least 4 weeks; up to $5,600 for hiring veterans who have been unemployed longer than 6 months; and up to $9,600 for businesses that hire veterans who have service-connected disabilities and have been unemployed longer than 6 months.
Though the unemployment rate among veterans of all ages is actually lower than the overall population, the rate is high among veterans of the current wars, standing at 12 percent, compared with about 9 percent for the population at large. The higher rate is driven largely by widespread joblessness among veterans under 25 years old, whose unemployment rate was 30 percent last month. 
There has long been debate among economists over whether tax credits actually create jobs, or simply reward businesses for hiring people that they would have hired anyway. In theAtlantic.com, Daniel Indivigliowrote recently that the tax credits might create at most a few new jobs, but that they were mainly likely to encourage the hiring of veterans over nonveterans when their qualifications are similar. 
"Few employers will create new jobs from scratch just to try to bring on more veterans and obtain the credit," Mr. Indiviglio wrote.
But Mr. Indiviglio also asserted that shifting the proportion of new hires toward veterans would be a good thing by helping to correct what he called "a grave injustice." 
"If these brave men and women chose not to fight for their country but merely remained civilians instead years ago, then many would more likely be employed today," he said.
That sentiment seems to be shared across ideological lines on Capitol Hill and in many business circles right now.
An editorial on Bloomberg.com last week, for instance, made the case that even if the tax credits do not stimulate the economy or create new jobs, they are morally the right thing to do. 
"We have no illusion that these credits are going to create lots of new jobs," the editorial said. "But they will encourage employers to favor veterans when hiring. In a robust, growing economy, that might be an unnecessary accommodation to returning military personnel. However, after a decade of brutal warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, where fighting men and women have served grueling multiple deployments, it seems a small and entirely just recompense."
On a White House blog, a Marine Corps veteran, Justin Constantine, wrote on Monday that the tax credits were not "an overall panacea to our veterans' unemployment problems," but when combined with other measures, might at least make a dent in the unemployment rate.
"Unfortunately, our youngest veterans are entering the private workforce at a very challenging time," Mr. Constantine wrote. "Many of them are likely to be employed in industries such as construction, manufacturing and transportation, which have all struggled in the last few years. Further, many of these vets come from and return to rural parts of the country, and do not have the benefit of a college degree. Another critical issue is that there currently does not exist a truly effective and cohesive transition assistance program for them. And on top of all that, a staggering number of our returning service members suffer from behavioral health issues, including Post Traumatic Stress, but these issues are not being adequately addressed."
Similarly, Peter Kramer, author of Listening to Prozac, said on NYTimes.com's Room for Debate on Monday that reducing joblessness among veterans might combat their high suicide rate. The new tax credits, he says, are "a step in the right direction."
"Study after study correlates unemployment with suicidality," Dr. Kramer wrote. "The workplace can be stressful, but especially for the mentally vulnerable, there is no substitute for what jobs offer in the way of structure, support and meaning."
Still, the bipartisan support for the Hire Heroes Act underscores another truism of Washington politics: Congress loves tax credits, which are an easy way to show concern for large or politically potent voting blocs. 
In the Washington Post earlier this month, Steve Bell, senior director of the economic policy project of the Bipartisan Policy Center, called it "ironic" and "incongruous" that both parties would get behind new tax credits amid the emerging national debate over tax simplification. 
"Tax entitlement reform will be tougher than direct spending entitlement reform," he said.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Backs Private Accounts as Social Security Cure

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich takes a more free-market approach to dealing with Social Security in the future. 

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich is proposing that younger workers be given the option of private retirement accounts as an alternative to Social Security, promising that investing in stocks and bonds will bring a richer payout than the current system. 
Mr. Gingrich, who is atop many recent polls of the Republican field, is unveiling his proposal in a speech Monday afternoon to students at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. 
"This gives Americans ownership over their retirement and the opportunity to unleash the power of the market to enjoy prosperous retirements beyond their most optimistic expectations, while also wiping out all future liabilities in the Social Security system," Mr. Gingrich plans to propose, according to an advance text obtained by The Associated Press.
The high cost of government entitlements has been a focus of the Republican primary campaign. Other candidates have suggested ways to revamp Social Security, a politically volatile issue. Mitt Romney suggested raising the retirement age for workers and slowing increases in benefits to higher-income people. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme, has sometimes suggested that it be dismantled and the responsibility passed to states. 
As president, George W. Bush once proposed private investments accounts as an alternative to the defined-benefit system that has been in place since the New Deal. It was rejected by Democrats in Congress. The chief criticism then - and one that may resound even more sharply in the wake of the financial crisis - is that retirees' benefits would be subject to the ups and downs of the markets, with no promise that, as Mr. Gingrich suggests, they will profit richly.

HEADLINE: Romney Blames Obama for the Collapsing Deficit Talks

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The presidential candidate said he wondered if the president was setting a "trap" to cut military spending. 

 BODY:
NASHUA, N.H. - Mitt Romney sought to blame President Obama for the collapsing talks on deficit reduction, intensifying criticism on Monday that he had been delivering over the weekend in New Hampshire. 
Calling Mr. Obama's handling of the situation "inexcusable," Mr. Romney seemed determined to pin the failings of the Congressional committee on deficit reduction on the president.
"What's most disappointing about that is that our president has had no involvement with the process," Mr. Romney said. "I find it extraordinary that there would be set up a committee, with such an important mission as finding a way to provide fiscal sanity in America, and with the penalty, if that fiscal sanity is not found, of a $600 billion cut to our military. I would have anticipated that the president of the United States would have spent every day and many nights working with members of the supercommittee to try to find a way to bridge the gap, but instead he's been out doing other things - campaigning, and blaming, and traveling."
As he has previously, Mr. Romney said he wondered if Mr. Obama was setting a "trap" to cut military spending.
"And the result of this trap is that we would dramatically cut our military commitments," Mr. Romney said, speaking here at BAE Systems, a defense and security contractor. "As Secretary Panetta has said, this would be a doomsday scenario if these cuts go forward," he added, referring to the defense secretary, Leon Panetta.
Painting the world as a "more dangerous" place - he warned of "a number of players who want to see an expansion of totalitarianism, and are building a network of totalitarian states" - Mr. Romney renewed his calls for Mr. Obama to prevent the proposed military cuts from going through now that the supercommittee has failed.
"In a setting like this, the idea that we're going to devastate our military is simply unacceptable," Mr. Romney said. "I would call on the president, and do call on the president, to immediately introduce legislation which says we will not have a $600 billion cut to America's military. We should not cut any funding from our base Department of Defense budget. That should not occur."
Mr. Romney is in favor of deficit-reduction measures, and had originally hoped that the supercommittee would reach a consensus. But across town at Rivier College in Nashua, Newt Gingrich - who is seen as having a "Newtlet" of building momentum across the country, and especially in New Hampshire - was criticizing the committee's mere existence and saying that its failure would be "good for America."
"I think it's going to fail," Mr. Gingrich said. "And I think it should fail, because it's exactly wrong."
Mr. Gingrich added: "They were trying to break out of the mess by being, in my judgment, even dumber - that is, creating a committee of 12 picked by the political leadership to magically get in a room to come up something that 535 couldn't solve."
Mr. Romney was introduced by Representative Charles Bass, Republican of New Hampshire, whose endorsement the campaign announced early Monday when it named Mr. Bass a co-chairman of its New Hampshire Steering Committee, as well as a member of Mr. Romney's National Steering Committee.
"Congressman Bass and his family have served New Hampshire with honor and distinction for generations," said Mr. Romney, in an e-mail statement from his campaign. "He has stood up for the traditional New Hampshire principles of limited taxation and smaller government. In addition, Congressman Bass understands that the current over-taxation and over-spending in Washington will only continue to hurt job creators."
However, Mr. Bass's support is an endorsement that comes with some potential drawbacks. In a campaign memo sent to senior staff members on Saturday from Mr. Romney's top New Hampshire strategist, Jim Merrill, and obtained by a reporter from the National Journal/CBS News, Mr. Merrill warned that Mr. Bass had signed off on a letter to the supercommittee saying he was open to the idea of revenue increases.
"He says he means through eliminating loopholes or simplifying the tax code, but conservatives don't trust Charlie and are guessing this means he'll vote to raise taxes," Mr. Merrill wrote. "No way to avoid it - it's part of the Charlie package."
Pointing to Mr. Bass's willingness to consider the idea of revenue increases, Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, used the endorsement to criticize Mr. Romney for what he said was his tax leniency toward the richest Americans. 
"This is one more indication that Mitt Romney is more interested in getting a perfect score on the Tea Party's litmus test than he is in putting country before party to do what's necessary to create jobs and reduce the deficit," Mr. LaBolt said in an e-mail statement. "Romney won't ask millionaires and billionaires for a dime to get our finances back on track - he would instead give them additional tax cuts and force the middle class and seniors to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction."

HEADLINE: Romney to Show First TV Ad of Campaign

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The ad attacks the president over his economic leadership . 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is set to show his first television ad of the presidential campaign on Tuesday in New Hampshire, spending $134,000 for spots scheduled to run until Sunday. The ads will attack President Obama over his economic leadership and begin on the day the president will visit the state to discuss his plans for turning around the economy.
In an interview Monday night with Fox News's Sean Hannity, Mr. Romney will offer a preview of his ad, which was first reported by ABC News. 
"Well, I want people to remember that when he was Candidate Obama, that he said he was going to get this economy going, he was going to bring people together, be a real leader for change in America," Mr. Romney said in an interview with Mr. Hannity that was taped Sunday. "And so I'm going to run an ad that shows him and the things he said here in New Hampshire in a speech here. The contrast between what he said and what he did is so stark, people will recognize we really do need to have someone new lead this country. And then I, of course, described why I'm the right person for that responsibility."
Mr. Romney explained: "So we'll put the ad up on Tuesday, the very day he comes to New Hampshire."
The Romney campaign refused to comment on the scheduled ad, and it unclear whether it will also run in Boston, a more expensive but larger media market.
Though the spot - and its timing - is aimed squarely at the president, it also represents something of a stealth attack from the Romney campaign, coming just days before the Thanksgiving holiday, a week normally considered a down period for politicking. (The Romney team itself has said it expected to keep a low-profile this week, but return to the trail after the weekend at an accelerated, full-force pace). 
The buy likely presages big spending on ads by Mr. Romney, which could force the other candidates and outside groups further onto the airwaves. Though some of the candidates and their "super PACs" have been putting money into ads - Representative Ron Paul of Texas, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, and Jon M. Huntsman Jr.'s super PAC have all gone up on the air already - the decision by Mr. Romney, who leads in many polls, to hold back had essentially frozen the ad war. The battle for airwaves, which was slow in getting started this cycle, will likely begin in earnest after Thanksgiving, with Mr. Romney's buy acting as a catalyst.
In recent weeks, there were signs that Mr. Romney's campaign was getting close to showing its first paid television spot. They set up cameras to record him in Iowa during a recent swing, and had three cameras trained on him and the crowd during his rally Sunday in Nashua, N.H.

HEADLINE: Romney's First Television Ad Attacks Obama on Economy

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney previewed his first television ad to Fox News's Sean Hannity on Monday evening. 

 BODY:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3a7FC0Jkv8&feature=player_embedded
Mitt Romney previewed his first television ad - set to go on the air in New Hampshire on Tuesday, with a $134,000 buy behind it - to Sean Hannity of Fox News on Monday evening.
The 60-second spot begins with images of President Obama in New Hampshire as the democratic nominee in 2008, talking about his plans to turn around the economy.
"I am confident that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis," says Mr. Obama in the old footage, as the words, "He failed," flash across the screen. "We need a rescue plan for the middle class. We need to provide relief for homeowners."
Then, the ad shows Mr. Obama saying, "If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose."
But the line, which is perhaps the spot's most devastating moment, is also the one that seems to be the most taken out of context. In fact, at the time, Mr. Obama was referring to something that an aide to his then opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona, had said in reference to the McCain campaign - not Mr. Obama, then or now.
In a 2008 interview with The New York Daily News, an aide to Mr. McCain warned, "If we keep talking about the economic crisis, we're going to lose," and Mr. Obama picked up the comment and began using it to mock Mr. McCain on the campaign trail.
As soon as the ad was broadcast on Mr. Hannity's show, the Romney campaign sent out an e-mail defending its use of Mr. Obama's quote. (The e-mail also included Mr. Obama's full quote: "Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.")
"Three years ago, candidate Barack Obama mocked his opponent's campaign for saying 'if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose,'" said Gail Gitcho, Mr. Romney's communications director, in an e-mail statement. "Now, President Obama's campaign is desperate not to talk about the economy. Their strategy is to wage a personal campaign - or 'kill Romney.' It is a campaign of distraction."
Ms. Gitcho added that "the tables have turned," and implied that the line Mr. Obama once used against Mr. McCain could now be leveled against Mr. Obama himself.
"President Obama and his campaign are doing exactly what candidate Obama criticized," she said in the statement. "President Obama and his team don't want to talk about the economy and have tried to distract voters from President Obama's abysmal economic record."
The ad, which will be broadcast in New Hampshire through Sunday, then cuts to Mr. Romney on the campaign trail.
"I'm going to do something to government," Mr. Romney says. "I call it the smaller, simpler, smarter approach to government."
Echoing a line he often repeats in his standard stump speech, Mr. Romney explains, "I'm going to get rid of Obamacare. It's killing jobs and it's keeping our kids from having the bright prospects they deserve."
The ad ends with Mr. Romney saying, "It's high time to bring those principles of fiscal responsibility to Washington, D.C." 
The spot will greet Mr. Obama when he arrives in New Hampshire on Tuesday for a visit to talk about his plans for turning around the economy. 
"I want people to remember that when he was Candidate Obama, that he said he was going to get this economy going, he was going to bring people together, be a real leader for change in America," Mr. Romney told Mr. Hannity. "And so I'm going to run an ad that shows him and the things he said here in New Hampshire in a speech here. The contrast between what he said and what he did is so stark, people will recognize we really do need to have someone new lead this country. And then I, of course, described why I'm the right person for that responsibility."
Mr. Romney explained: "So we'll put the ad up on Tuesday, the very day he comes to New Hampshire."
Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, responded to the ad by saying, "Just last week fact checkers scolded Mitt Romney for distorting a comment the president made about creating American jobs and now Romney launches a deceitful and dishonest attack rather than outline his own record or plans for the future."

HEADLINE: The White Party

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans triumphed in the mid-term election with help from a surge of white voters. Will doubling down on the same strategy work in 2012? 

 BODY:
In the wake of the 2008 election, conservative Republican strategists like Karl Rove, Grover Norquist and William Kristol warned that their party faced even worse defeats if it continued in its anti-immigrant posturing.
"An anti-Hispanic attitude is suicidal," Rove wrote. The decision to "demagogue" the immigration issue was a "totally self-inflicted wound by House Republicans," Kristol declared. "Beating up on immigrants," Grover Norquist said, "loses you votes."
Their advice was rejected. Republicans running for the House and the Senate defiantly calculated that they could win in 2010 with a surge of white voters, affirming the Republican role as the default party of white America. Initially, this approach appeared quixotic. A demographic tidal wave of African-American and Hispanic voters threatened to wash the Republicans out to sea.
But many Republican candidates - incumbents and challengers - did not budge. They not only held firm in their adamant opposition to immigration reform (despite its crucial importance to many Hispanic voters), but they also became even more hard-nosed. Former apostates on the issue, like Senator John McCain of Arizona, who had proudly backed immigration reform in 2004 and 2005, saw the light - in other words, read poll data on Republican voters - and moved to the right.
To use just one particularly egregious example, Senator David Vitter - who admitted that he had "let down and disappointed" family, friends and supporters but refused to answer questions about his connections to prostitutes - used an outspoken anti-immigration ad to win re-election easily in Louisiana.
The decision to carry the banner for conservative white America paid off in the midterm elections - helped enormously, of course, by a dismal economy under a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress, as well as conservative hostility to the administration's health care program and economic stimulus legislation.
In 2010, the Republican white strategy was boosted by the fact that minority turnout traditionally drops in non-presidential years, perhaps especially so without Obama on the ballot. But the scope of success went far beyond expectations.
The percentage of non-Hispanic whites voting for Republican House candidates in 2010, 62 percent, set a record for off-year contests, beating even the 1994 Republican rout when Republicans got 58 percent of the white vote. In presidential elections, you have to go back to the landslide Republican victories of 1972 (Richard Nixon versus George McGovern) and 1984 (Ronald Reagan versus Walter Mondale) to get white Republican margins similar to those of 2010. McGovern and Mondale carried just one state each, Massachusetts and Minnesota respectively.
Another way of looking at it is this: fully 88.8 percent of all ballots cast in 2010 for House Republicans were cast by whites, compared to 63.9 percent for Democrats.
The degree to which the Republican Party has become a white party is also reflected in the composition of primary voters. For example, on March 4, 2008, in Ohio - where non-Hispanic whites are 81.1 percent of the population, blacks 12.2 percent, and Hispanics 3.1 percent - the Republican primary turnout was 97 percent white. Hispanics were 2 percent and the black turnout was so low it was zero percent, statistically speaking. One percent was described as "other."
In the Jan. 19, 2008, South Carolina primary, 96 percent of the Republican turnout was white, 2 percent black, 1 percent Latino and 1 percent other. The population of the state is 64.1 percent white, 27.9 percent black and 5.1 percent Hispanic.
Now, moving toward what has all the markings of a historic ideological and demographic collision on Nov. 6, 2012, Republicans are doubling down on this racially fraught strategy.
While the subject of race and of the overwhelmingly white Republican primary electorate are never explicitly discussed by Republican candidates, the issue is subsumed in blatant anti-immigration rhetoric. As Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, learned the hard way, voicing sympathy for the plight of the undocumented is a sure way to lose ground.
The once-ascendant Perry torpedoed his own bid during a Sept. 22 debate in Orlando, Fla., when he endorsed using taxpayer dollars to educate the children of illegal immigrants. A single sentence started him on a downward slide:
If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart.
The major threat to the Republican "white" strategy is a revival of the high turnout among minorities that carried Democrats to victory in 2008. Republicans, however, are taking advantage of their newly won control of state governments across the country to enact laws designed to suppress minority turnout.
Republican legislators and governors are reversing decades of liberalized access to the ballot by passing laws restricting or eliminating election day registration, early voting, the broader use of absentee ballots and voting by mail.
At least eight states have enacted legislation to curb access to the polls, including three key battlegrounds in the presidential race: Wisconsin, Florida and Ohio.
Liberal groups, including the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School, estimate that as many as five million men and women will be unable to vote because of these laws, which disproportionately affect minority voters.
With less than a year to go until the election, poll data suggest that the Republican "white" strategy has a chance of working. Since 2008, the Republican Party's biggest gains, and Obama's sharpest declines, have been among white voters.
Gene Ulm, a partner at Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican firm that conducts the NBC/Wall Street Journal surveys with Peter D. Hart Research Associates, a Democratic company, wrote on September 16 that among whites on two key measures - ratings of Obama's job performance and his image or personal favorability ratings - the president has dropped below a crucial tipping point: "Even following the disastrous-for-Democrats 2010 mid-term elections, President Obama's image was net-positive among white voters, 45%-38%; it is now upside-down by a wide margin, 36%-52%."
The non-partisan Pew Research Center reported in July that measurements of partisan identification showed increasing Republican margins among white voters. In 2008, 46 percent of whites said they were Republicans or generally voted for Republicans, and 44 percent were Democrats, a virtual tie. By the summer of 2011, however, the Republican advantage had grown to 52-39.
The shift, Pew noted, was "particularly pronounced among the young and poor." Whites under 30 in 2008 favored Democrats by seven points, but by mid-2011 gave the Republican party an 11 point edge, a substantial 18 point shift. Similarly, whites with incomes under $30,000 had favored Democrats by 15 points in 2008, but in 2011 tilted Republican by four points, a 19 point shift.
Regardless of the ultimate success of the Republican strategy, these trends guarantee that race and ethnicity will be dominant themes underlying the 2012 election, infusing the debate over deficits, taxes and government spending. In the 140 years from the end of Reconstruction to the present, no matter what the motives of those engaging in the debate, these divisive issues have worked to the advantage of economic elites and there is no reason to believe this will change.

HEADLINE: Fresh Look for Author, And for Land He Lauded

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
PETROPOLIS, Brazil -- When the Viennese-born writer Stefan Zweig moved in 1941 to this city of imperial palaces nestled in the mountains near Rio de Janeiro, he was one of world's most translated authors, renowned for his taut novellas exploring passion, obsession and despair.
But after Mr. Zweig, despondent over the advances of the Nazis, took his own life here a few months later at age 60 in a suicide pact with his young wife, Lotte, he became known in his adopted country for creating one of most hackneyed phrases ever associated with Brazil: ''Country of the Future.''
Derived from the title of his 1941 book praising Latin America's largest country, the phrase got expanded and recycled ad nauseam as a refrain, ''Brazil is the country of the future -- and always will be,'' used to casually dismiss a nation long plagued by high inflation and entrenched corruption.
With Brazil's prospects now notably improved, Brazilians are reassessing Mr. Zweig and his legacy as the book's title gains new currency yet again, with everyone from advertising executives to visiting European diplomats and even President Obama, who visited Brazil in March, using it in a speech to suggest that perhaps Brazil's ''future'' has finally arrived. 
''Brazil isn't the country of the future anymore,'' said Romero Rodrigues, a Brazilian Internet entrepreneur, in one typical new repackaging of the term. ''It's the country of the present.''
The house where Mr. Zweig took his own life here by swallowing poison is set to reopen soon as a museum. Meanwhile, Brazilian writers and historians have been reflecting on the significance of ''Land of the Future,'' and some of the political intrigue surrounding its publication 70 years ago.
In a recent televised discussion of Mr. Zweig, Alcino Leite Neto, editor of the publishing house Publifolha, compared his importance in Brazil to that in the United States of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French political thinker who wrote about American concepts of liberty and equality in ''Democracy in America.''
''We had Stefan Zweig,'' said Mr. Leite Neto, ''who left us this book advocating tolerance, comprehension between people, an indictment in favor of peace, written right during World War II.''
A broader appreciation of his work is also under way, with two Brazilian feature films in production adapted from his writing, one from ''The Invisible Collection,'' about Germany's experience with inflation, and another from ''Leporella,'' about a housemaid who becomes infatuated with her employer.
But it is ''Land of the Future'' itself (published here since the 1940s in various editions as ''Country of the Future''), and Mr. Zweig's wanderings in Brazil before his death, which have recently ignited the most interest.
Cultural officials in Petropolis this year organized a multimedia exhibit called ''Stefan Zweig Lives!'', and some Brazilians have begun joining the Europeans and Americans who occasionally appear in the city to see his house on Goncalves Dias Street, or even the cemetery where he and Lotte are buried side by side.
''It's a little strange taking someone to the places of such tragedy, but we're happy to receive every kind of visitor,'' said Walter Raposo, 80, a horse-carriage driver in Petropolis who has guided several Zweig aficionados to these spots; they find Mr. Raposo and his carriage in front of the Brazilian emperor's former summer palace, now a museum.
Alberto Dines, a television host and eminence among Brazil's journalists who met Mr. Zweig as a child when the writer visited his school in Rio de Janeiro, has been a driving force behind the renewed attention in Petropolis and beyond.
His research and his own book on Mr. Zweig, ''Death in Paradise,'' explore in detail the complicated origins of the book's title, which Mr. Dines explains was not Mr. Zweig's creation but a suggestion from James Stern, who translated his book into English from the German.
In a touch of irony, Mr. Zweig, born in Vienna's golden age to affluent Jewish parents, alluded in the book's epigraph to a line in French, ''une terre d'avenir,'' from correspondence received by Arthur de Gobineau, a 19th-century French aristocrat, diplomat and theorist of European racial superiority who detested Brazil.
''It's a curious thing, because Gobineau was the father of modern racism,'' said Mr. Dines, who at age 79 is overseeing the completion of Casa Stefan Zweig, the museum created at the house where Mr. Zweig lived. ''Coming from racist Europe, Zweig was amazed seeing the different races mixing so freely in Brazil.''
Of course, some contend Mr. Zweig's largely optimistic observations on race relations at the time belied circumstances that were considerably more complex -- and continue to be as affirmative action programs spreading across Brazil seek to reverse centuries of exclusion.
Still, Mr. Zweig's optimism was not dimmed by the obvious challenges in Brazil in the early 1940s, like an average life expectancy of 43 years and a population that was 56 percent illiterate. Some of his sanguine assessments continue to impress today.
He claimed, for instance, that Portugal had been farsighted by colonizing Brazil partly by emptying Portuguese prisons of undesired elements and sending them across the Atlantic. ''As usual, it is not altogether clean manure which is the earth's best preparation for future harvests,'' Mr. Zweig wrote.
Mr. Zweig's reappraisal here coincides with renewed crisis in Europe -- and with a new wave of Portuguese emigration to Brazil, but this time of unemployed professionals, not convicts. Some of those seeking opportunity in Brazil may even know that Mr. Zweig remains highly esteemed in parts of Europe, especially France, where his books are still widely available.
Strangely, Mr. Zweig's book on Brazil was fiercely criticized in Brazil shortly after its publication. Critics laid waste to the Austrian writer with vehemence, opening him to insinuation that he was paid by the authoritarian regime of Getulio Vargas to write the book.
Mr. Dines said the scathing reviews had been a way for reviewers to indirectly get back at Mr. Vargas's censors, since the critics equated praising Brazil with praising its dictatorship. Either way, the author of numerous best sellers had little need for Brazil's financial support.
But Mr. Zweig did need something else at the time: a haven from the Nazis. Mr. Dines, based on his own research of Mr. Zweig's path to Brazil, argues that the writer had an implicit deal with Brazilian authorities to produce his book in exchange for the residence permits hastily granted in Buenos Aires to him and his wife.
After all that, some mystery persists as to why he would kill himself soon after arriving in Brazil. He had acknowledged that a lifetime might be insufficient to properly understand Brazil. But in the suicide note he left describing himself as ''one without a country,'' he still had only praise for the ''marvelous'' Brazil that received him.
''After I saw the country of my own language fall, and my spiritual land -- Europe -- destroying itself,'' he concluded, ''it would require immense strength to reconstruct my life.''

HEADLINE: For Deficit Panel, Failure Cuts Two Ways

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The latest Congressional failure to agree on a plan for balancing the government's books could yield a surprising result: a sharp reduction in annual federal deficits, larger than anything contemplated by the special panel that reached its fruitless finale on Monday.
But the absence of an agreement also threatens to significantly slow growth in an already ailing economy by raising taxes on almost everyone while reducing government spending on almost everything.
Tax cuts passed in the Bush administration will expire at the end of 2012. By law, the panel's failure triggers new caps on spending, cutting $1.2 trillion from the military, education, health care and other priorities over 10 years beginning next fall. The combined impact of higher tax rates and less spending would reverse the growth of annual deficits beginning in 2013, reducing by more than half the current $1.3 trillion gap between annual revenue and spending.
That has inverted the normal reality, in which spending rises inexorably unless Congress musters the political will to impose cuts. Now, although both parties say they are committed to more gradual approaches, an agreement is required to avoid the fiscal equivalent of shock therapy. 
''There could be a bit of a silver lining,'' said Rosanne Altshuler, an economist at Rutgers University who served on President George W. Bush's 2005 tax reform panel. ''It forces us to come to terms with cuts in areas that have been difficult to touch -- the military and Medicare. We may not like how the cuts are going to be done, but we better start dealing with the fact that cuts are going to have to be made.''
The latest committee, created in August as part of a deal to let the federal government borrow more money, was charged with identifying at least $1.2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. Its failure forces the same amount of spending cuts, with half the money coming from the military budget.
The immediate economic impact depends first on investors, who must decide whether they are now any more concerned about the nation's financial condition. Any increase in the interest rates that the government must pay would widen the deficit, as would any decrease in economic growth. But while stock market indexes fell sharply Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 248.85 points, investors continue to pay for the opportunity to lend money to the United States. Two credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, affirmed their ratings of United States debt securities on Monday and said the failure did not change their assessment of the government's ability to pay its debts. Fitch, a third agency, said it was reviewing its ratings and hoped to make a conclusion by the end of the month. It said in August that a failure by the special committee would probably result in a negative rating.
A second, looming question is whether Congress will extend a payroll tax break for workers and continue supplemental benefits for the long-term unemployed, both scheduled to expire at the end of the year. The tax break reduces the amount that workers must pay for Social Security; the extended benefits provide support for 3.5 million Americans who have been out of a job for longer than 26 weeks. The government will spend about $168 billion on the two programs this year. Economic forecasters estimate that a decision to end the benefits would reduce the country's economic growth next year by more than one percentage point.
The Obama administration had hoped to wrap extensions of both benefits into a broader agreement. It now faces the challenge of rescuing a smaller compromise from the ruins of the negotiations, with some Republicans in outright opposition and others demanding offsetting cuts in other federal spending.
President Obama plans to call for the extension of both programs in New Hampshire on Tuesday.
Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas on the special negotiating committee, said on ''Fox News Sunday'' that its members had been ''laser-focused on trying to get success'' on the payroll tax measure. But, he added, ''the bigger tragedy is we have unsustainable debt that is threatening our national security, is threatening our jobs, frankly, and is threatening our children's future.''
The decisions that must be made by the end of next year over the future of the Bush tax cuts and the reductions in spending are far larger, as are the economic consequences.
The Obama administration wants to extend most Bush-era tax cuts while restoring higher rates for higher incomes. Democrats say they will not strike any agreement on spending cuts without an agreement to raise new revenue. Mr. Obama repeated on Monday that he would veto any legislation extending all of the cuts. Republicans say they will accept nothing less.
A Moody's Analytics report warns that failing a deal, the combined impact will amount to a ''historically extreme'' reduction in the deficit that could push the economy into recession. It notes that under current law, federal revenue would increase as a share of economic activity by 3.7 percentage points over 2012 and 2013 -- the sharpest rise since 1969, when, Moody's says, sudden tax increases ''helped set off a mild recession.'' Combined with the required budget cuts, the deficit would shrink to $510 billion from $1.3 trillion by 2013.
''You're seeing a very rapid depletion of the budget deficit,'' said Ben Garber, an economist with Moody's Capital Markets Research Group who wrote the report. ''You're taking a weak economy and removing a large part of potential demand, which could be enough to tip us into recession.''
There is still plenty of time for Congress to unlock its self-imposed handcuffs and renounce frugality. Next year's elections also could produce a clear mandate for one party to reduce deficits according to its priorities without any need for compromises. Partisans at both ends of the political spectrum said they welcomed the failure of the current talks as an opportunity to win just such a mandate.
Over the last month, conservatives feared that the committee would settle for cosmetic cuts. They now see an opportunity to secure larger reductions, without tax increases, to encourage faster growth.
Liberals hope the Occupy Wall Street protests have shifted political debate from an overriding focus on the long-term danger posed by the federal deficit toward a focus on unemployment, income inequality and other immediate economic problems.
''This committee was created at a very different time, when the dialogue was that our deficits were too big and unsustainable,'' said Martin Hart-Landsberg, a professor of economics at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. ''This failure gives us time to help educate and change that dialogue, to focus on job creation and the direction of the economy.''

HEADLINE: Training Lawyers: Theory vs. Practice

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''What They Don't Teach Law Students: Lawyering'' (front page, Nov. 20) reports that law firms want law schools to focus less on the ''theoretical'' and more on practical skills.
Law schools already do focus on these skills, in clinics, internships, externships and intensive writing requirements. But learning the ''theoretical'' -- how to read carefully, to argue and analyze incisively -- lays the foundations for lawyering. 
Working on a student-edited law journal -- writing student notes and editing scholarly articles -- is an effective method of teaching the foundations. That is one reason that law firms value the law journal credential.
Law firms and postgraduate practice courses are far better suited than law schools for educating in the particulars of practice, which vary from place to place and even from firm to firm.
Law schools should stick to what they do best: laying the foundations for a life in practice.
ARTHUR JACOBSON New York, Nov. 20, 2011
The writer is a professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University.
To the Editor:
I know that a number of my colleagues at major law schools are chafing about your article because it doesn't talk about the changes occurring in legal education -- more clinics (almost everywhere), deals courses (lots of places), a new problem-solving workshop (Harvard), a reconfiguration of the academic calendars to allow law students to take classes elsewhere in the university to deepen the understanding of policy or business (Stanford), and more.
But, even as someone who is a participant in lots of the efforts to stimulate reform (such as the recent Carnegie-inspired Educating Tomorrow's Lawyers initiative) and a teacher committed to problem-solving and team-based practical education in my own classes, I think your article is right on and a necessary kick in the pants for legal education.
The changes that law schools are making are important, but they are marginal at best relative to the need for change. If law firms refused to hire students without better preparation, the situation would change. If students refused to hand over their $150,000 without getting a better education, it would change.
My bet is on the law schools that figure out how to partner with law firms and their clients to create incentives for law schools to do more.
GILLIAN K. HADFIELD Los Angeles, Nov. 20, 2011
The writer is a professor of law and economics at the U.S.C. Gould School of Law.
To the Editor:
''What They Don't Teach Law Students: Lawyering'' seems to miss the point of what a well-rounded and practical legal education requires: an understanding of ''the law'' as a framework under which any niche practice can flourish.
In a country governed by common law principles as well as statutes, a superficial education focused on contemporary rules is as limiting practically as it is intellectually. When an issue more challenging (and interesting) than the filing of a corporate merger arises, an attorney who understands the law's development and can recognize the principles and exceptions behind the rules will serve clients far better than one who is accomplished in rote memorization.
LUCAS ANDERSON Brooklyn, Nov. 20, 2011
The writer is a second-year associate and a 2010 graduate of George Washington University Law School.
To the Editor:
Perhaps law schools should take a cue from medical education and require internships. After graduation, newly minted lawyers would spend one or two years learning how to actually be a lawyer. Designated law firms would provide hands-on training in different legal areas: corporate, criminal, family law and so on.
Everyone wins: firms would get low-paid workers, clients would pay less and young lawyers would get valuable real-world training.
STEPHEN H. URETSKY Linwood, N.J., Nov. 20, 2011
The writer is an ophthalmologist.
To the Editor:
The article fails to confront the actual complexity of the challenges law schools face. Law firms and their clients would be just as unhappy with freshly minted lawyers who could draft a contract but were incapable of anticipating complications as they are with smart law grads who cannot file a simple motion.
Competent and skilled lawyering is not merely a craft. It also requires the development of deeper intellectual skills. And law schools need to teach students to be ethical professionals.
Certainly, many law schools are out of balance in this regard. The real issue is: How should law schools integrate teaching the more basic practice skills with intellectual skills and professionalism?
TIM IGLESIAS San Francisco, Nov. 20, 2011
The writer is a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law.
To the Editor:
Many years ago, as a third-year law student, I was almost hit by a bus in New York City. Once safely on the curb, I realized that if I'd been hit and survived such an accident, I had no idea whom, or how, to sue.
Irritating.

HEADLINE: Ex-Saturn Plant to Reopen, And G.M. to Add 700 Jobs

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors on Monday said it planned to bring nearly 700 jobs back to its idled assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., next year for work on any of the company's cars whenever extra production is needed.
Such a flexible plant, which G.M. said would allow for ''real-time reaction to sales spikes in a given car or crossover,'' would be unusual in the auto industry. The company said it would spend $61 million preparing the plant to start building the Chevrolet Equinox, a small Canadian-built crossover for which G.M. has had difficulty keeping up with demand, in the second half of 2012. 
G.M. said it would later add about 1,200 more jobs at the plant and invest $183 million to build a new midsize vehicle there for the 2015 model year.
G.M. agreed in September to reopen the Spring Hill plant as part of its four-year labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union. The assembly plant, originally the home of G.M.'s now-defunct Saturn brand, shut down in 2009, though an engine plant on the site remains in operation.
''Spring Hill has a history as one of G.M.'s most innovative and flexible plants,'' Cathy Clegg, G.M.'s vice president of labor relations, said in a statement. ''We're pleased that, working together with the U.A.W., we were able to build on that history and develop a plan to resume production at Spring Hill.''
G.M. and U.A.W. officials said they expected to hire 400 to 500 new workers as part of the first round of jobs coming back to the plant. Those workers would be paid entry-level wages, which start at about $15 an hour, a little more than half as much as full-wage workers earn.
''The best economic stimulus that there is a job,'' Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said at a ceremony at the plant Monday. ''And Spring Hill is going to have plenty of new jobs coming in.''
A small number of the workers who were laid off when the plant closed remain in the area, about 30 miles south of Nashville. Others transferred to G.M. plants in other states, but of those who did, only 280 chose a relocation package that allowed them to automatically transfer back to Spring Hill when the plant reopened. About 800 others gave up that right by choosing to take a $30,000 lump-sum relocation payment, Ms. Clegg said in a conference call with reporters.
Most of the dislocated former Spring Hill employees now work in Lansing, Mich. Some left their families behind in Tennessee and were hoping the plant's resurrection would mean they could return home.
Joe Ashton, a U.A.W. vice president who leads the union's G.M. department, said it was unclear how many of the Spring Hill jobs would be on the entry-level pay scale because some of the former employees who transferred would undoubtedly want to stay at their new plant.
Ms. Clegg said the plan to build the Equinox in Spring Hill would not affect production of the vehicle at two plants in Canada where it is currently built. Sales of the Equinox are up 45 percent in the United States this year, and it has been consistently in short supply since being redesigned more than two years ago.
The reopening of G.M.'s Spring Hill plant was a major victory for the union in contract negotiations. The U.A.W. president, Bob King, said he believed getting the plant back online and persuading the three Detroit automakers to commit to adding nearly 20,000 new jobs over all was more critical than asking for wage increases.
''Collectively in the U.A.W., we made a decision to make the communities in America our No. 1 priority,'' Mr. King told workers who gathered at the plant Monday for the announcement. ''Most important to us was creating jobs for more Americans.''
Though the event was largely celebratory, the workers loudly booed Bob Corker, the Republican senator from Tennessee, who criticized the union during Congressional hearings in 2008 that led to the federal government bailouts of G.M. and Chrysler.
The mayor of Spring Hill, Michael Dinwiddie, called the plant's reopening ''a tremendous moment in history'' and expressed his elation that G.M. was coming back to ''this underdog of a city that almost everyone had written off.''

HEADLINE: A Blow to Pinstripe Aspirations

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE; Joan Caplin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Earlier this fall, Steve Ferdman celebrated getting a job offer from Credit Suisse in the usual Wall Street fashion. Over expensive oysters and dark rum cocktails at a trendy Manhattan restaurant with his parents, he toasted landing the full-time position after working six months as a consultant without benefits.
A week later, Mr. Ferdman, 28, sat alone at the same place and ordered a gin and tonic to lament getting laid off by the bank, for the second time since 2008. When he told the bartender about his misfortune, his next round was on the house.
''I did everything right. I came into work every day, I put in long hours, and I still got punched in the face,'' Mr. Ferdman said. ''People shouldn't want to work in this industry anymore.'' 
Being young on Wall Street once meant having it all: style, smarts and too much money to spend wisely. Now, twenty-somethings in the finance industry are losing both cash and cachet.
Three years after the global financial crisis nearly brought Wall Street firms to the brink, the nation's largest banks are again struggling. As profits wane, layoffs have claimed thousands of jobs and those still employed have watched their compensation shrink. These problems are set against the morale-crushing backdrop of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has made a villain of a once-lionized industry.
Much of the burden of Wall Street's latest retrenchment has fallen on young financiers. The number of investment bank and brokerage firm employees between the ages 20 and 34 fell by 25 percent from the third quarter of 2008 to the same period of 2011, a loss of 110,000 jobs from layoffs, attrition and voluntary departures.
By comparison, industry headcount dropped by 17 percent in the same period, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data for New York City provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of staff members over the age of 55 decreased by only 11 percent.
Young financiers have experienced setbacks in the past. Bankers and traders who rushed wide-eyed to Wall Street in the halcyon days of the 1980s were waylaid by the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, known as Black Monday. Then they got pummeled in 2000 by the dot-com collapse and the recession that followed.
But experts say that today's doldrums, unlike previous downturns, are here to stay.
''A lot of the positions that are being cut right now aren't coming back,'' said Leslie K. Hild, a vice president with the recruiting firm Right Management. ''It's an emotional roller coaster for almost everyone.''
The industry's woes have also affected the plans of undergraduate and graduate students at the nation's top colleges.
At Harvard Business School, where a relatively high 39 percent of this year's graduates went into finance, compared to 34 percent last year, there has been a ''heck of a lot more anxiety'' about next year's hiring season, according to William A. Sahlman, a professor of business administration.
''People used to think of some of these organizations, like a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs, as safe career bets,'' Professor Sahlman said. ''Those firms are not going away, but they're going to hire half the people they hired before.''
Several large firms are not recruiting new entry-level analysts for their investment banking divisions this fall, having filled their entire incoming class with last summer's interns. At the University of Pennsylvania, whose Wharton School is the closest thing that exists to a Wall Street farm team, Goldman Sachs canceled its informational session.
The mood is even darker outside the Ivy League. Matthew Slotnick, a senior economics major at Boston College, said that he had sent more than 100 resumes to contacts on Wall Street and received several interviews. But he has not gotten any offers. Mr. Slotnick, who has wanted to work at an investment bank since entering college, is now applying to smaller banks and firms outside of New York.
''People are saying it's sort of a 2007, 2008-type hiring climate,'' he said. ''I haven't given up, but it's a bit depressing.''
Any sympathy for Wall Street's huddled masses yearning to get rich should be tempered by the fact that financial sector recessions often deal a soft blow. Laid-off financial workers typically get large severance packages, including the use of outplacement services. During their job hunt, many can draw on substantial savings built off past bonuses, on top of collecting unemployment.
But for those laid-off Wall Street workers whose golden tickets have vanished, the disillusionment is real.
Sam Meek, 27, who was laid off in September when his Connecticut hedge fund decided to downsize, used to spend $500 on charity dinners and lavish golf outings. Now, it's home-cooked meals and beer on the sofa. Recently, Mr. Meek and his roommate, another unemployed banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his job search, sat together in the kitchen filing for unemployment and drinking a bottle of Champagne.
''I'm scraping by right now,'' he said.
Mr. Meek, a former Marine, says he is pursuing several job options, including an opportunity to help develop a social network for the military. But he remains reluctant to commit to a new company.
''I'm doing full due diligence,'' he said.
Older financiers are having problems, too. Ian C. Horowitz, 40, a former equity researcher at Rafferty Capital Markets, was laid off in June when his firm decided to outsource its research division. Mr. Horowitz currently collects $400 a week in unemployment benefits and has been mowing lawns and doing odd jobs around his New Jersey town to support his wife and two children.
Mr. Horowitz, who lived through the downturn of 2001, said that the latest cuts felt different.
''There have been economic moments where things were bad, but you knew the pendulum would swing the other direction,'' he said. ''This is structural. The playing field has changed.''
Wall Street's social scene has also changed, thanks to Occupy Wall Street and the fear of reproach from industry outsiders. Today's young bankers no longer brag about their jobs, especially in public. One twenty-something Goldman Sachs employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak on the record, said he now told new acquaintances he worked at a consulting firm.
The mood has darkened so much that even the young Wall Street workers who still have prestigious jobs are considering letting go of the brass ring.
''It's lost its luster,'' said a former Goldman analyst who left the financial sector this year. The former analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he signed a confidentiality agreement with the firm, said that in addition to losing some of the monetary benefits of their jobs, his friends who remained in finance were suffering from peer envy. ''The new status jobs aren't at Goldman Sachs. They're at Google, Apple and Facebook.''
For many of the high-achieving, type-A young professionals who end up on Wall Street, being tossed around by an industry in tumult can amount to the first real failure of their lives. Even if the industry recovers, some may not stick around long enough to see their fortunes improve.
''I'm still scratching my head,'' said a former employee of Nomura, the large Japanese bank, who was laid off on Oct. 1. ''I went to the right schools, I know the right people and I'm very good at what I do. But when you have to cut costs, you have to cut costs.''
The ex-Nomura employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because a confidentiality clause is attached to her severance package, said she had recently come across a group of Occupy Wall Street protesters in Lower Manhattan. While she said she did not support all their ideals, she could now sympathize with their frustrations about high unemployment and a growing sense of economic hopelessness.
''I'm in the same boat as these guys,'' she said of the protesters. ''I just want to start working.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Its Allies Expand Sanctions Against Iran

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London, and Eric Dash from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Major Western powers took significant steps on Monday to cut Iran off from the international financial system, announcing coordinated sanctions aimed at its central bank and commercial banks. The measures, a response to a recent United Nations report warning about Iran's nuclear activities, tighten the vise on Iran but still fall short of a blanket cutoff.
The United States also imposed sanctions on companies involved in Iran's nuclear industry, as well as on its petrochemical and oil industries, adding to existing measures that seek to weaken the Iranian government by depriving it of its ability to refine gasoline or invest in its petroleum industry. 
The United States, Britain and Canada each announced measures aimed at shutting off Iran's access to foreign banks and credit. The European Union is expected to approve similar measures on Thursday, in what amounts to a concerted response to the finding this month by the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran may be continuing to work on a nuclear weapon and delivery system.
The Treasury Department named the Central Bank of Iran and the entire Iranian banking system as a ''primary money laundering concern'' -- an unusual and symbolically important step, but one that is short of formal sanctions, which would probably be resisted by China and other Asian countries that import oil from Iran. The Obama administration is also worried that such a step could drive up oil prices while the economy is fragile.
Still, the administration sought to portray the measures as a major increase in pressure on Iran's leadership, which they called on to return to the bargaining table over its nuclear program.
''The message is clear,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in announcing the steps. ''If Iran's intransigence continues, it will face increasing pressure and isolation.''
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, standing next to her, said the United States had not ruled out formally sanctioning the central bank, a step that would have a more draconian effect on Iran because it would cut off from the American market any foreign bank that does business with the central bank.
Mr. Geithner insisted that simply labeling Iran's banking system as a risk for money laundering would cause foreign banks to think twice about dealing with it. With the American, British and Canadian actions, he said Iran was effectively cut off ''from three of the world's largest financial sectors.''
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who has taken a particularly aggressive line toward Iran, called Monday for major powers to freeze the assets of the central bank and suspend purchases of Iranian oil.
For all the tough talk, some analysts predicted that the measures would do little to stop Iran from its pursuit of a nuclear capability.
''The fact that they don't have letters of credit, the fact that they don't have access to state-of-the-art Western technology is great,'' said Danielle Pletka, an expert on sanctions at the American Enterprise Institute. ''But you have to ask, were we able to impose crippling sanctions that Secretary Clinton once talked about, would we get ahead of them in their development of a nuclear program?
China, Japan and other countries use Iran's central bank to process transactions from their purchases of Iranian oil, in part because most of Iran's major commercial banks are already subject to sanctions. They would be likely to resist an order to stop dealing with the central bank, and this would put the administration in an untenable position, since the United States could not sever its ties with Chinese or Japanese banks.
Mr. Obama could request a waiver to exempt such institutions from the ban, but experts on sanctions said that such a waiver would undermine the credibility of the United States. The White House has been under pressure from Republicans to designate the central bank, and has worked to forestall such legislation.
The administration has telegraphed its intention to seek further sanctions against Iran since the publication of the nuclear agency's report. The White House pushed the agency to be as detailed as possible in its evidence of Iran's nuclear activities as a way of building international support for sanctions. But Russia and China both pushed back, with Russia arguing that diplomacy is still the best course.
Iran reacted angrily to the agency's report, and renewed its display of displeasure on Monday by not attending a gathering of 97 countries at the Vienna headquarters of the atomic energy agency, which was called to discuss nuclear issues related to the Middle East. Tehran says its nuclear program is solely for peaceful, civilian purposes.
Administration officials said Iran's economy was suffering badly because of existing sanctions over the nuclear issue. Its oil and gas industry, they said, is short of capital and technology, with most foreign investors having left the country. The new steps are the first time that the United States has taken aim at the petrochemical industry, which is the second largest source of revenue for the Iranian government, after oil.
Analysts said the latest measures would intensify that pressure, but warned that changing Iran's behavior would require patience.
''We're trying to do two things: stress the Iranian economy as a means of impacting the Iranian decision makers' attitude, and using sanctions and other tools to slow the nuclear program,'' said Ray Takeyh, an expert on Iran at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It's a long-term proposition.''

HEADLINE: Postal Chief Seeks Ability To Cut Costs to Stem Loss

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Unless Congress passes far-reaching legislation soon to give the Postal Service the flexibility it needs to cut costs, the agency will suffer disastrous losses that could jeopardize its long-term future, Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general, warned on Monday.
Speaking at a National Press Club luncheon, Mr. Donahoe said that neither of the two bills passed recently by House and Senate committees went far enough to help the post office achieve its goal of cutting $20 billion from its annual costs, which are now about $75 billion, by 2015. 
''If passed today, either bill would provide at best one year of profitability, and at least a decade of steep losses,'' Mr. Donahoe said.
Last week, the Postal Service reported a $5.1 billion loss for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
Mr. Donahoe criticized the Senate bill for not letting his agency move immediately to cut deliveries to five days a week from six, a move he said would save $3 billion a year. Instead, the Senate bill would require two years of study and set several conditions for such a cut.
The Postal Service has fallen into an economic crisis for complex reasons.
A big factor is that annual mail volume has dropped more than 20 percent -- some 40 billion pieces -- from five years ago. The decline is largely because of the explosion of e-mail and electronic bill-paying, along with the overall economic slump.
Mr. Donahoe said his agency's finances were also severely constrained by regulations making it hard to raise the price of stamps, to introduce products or to close post offices. Mr. Donahoe, who noted that the Postal Service did not receive any taxpayer dollars, said 25,000 of the nation's 32,000 post offices operated at a loss, with thousands having less than $20,000 in annual revenue, but costing more than $60,000 a year to operate.
''We're in a deep financial crisis today because we have a business model that's tied to the past,'' he said. ''We are expected to operate like a business, but don't have the flexibility to do so. Our business model is fundamentally inflexible. It prevents the Postal Service from solving its problems.''
Another cause of the agency's deficit is a 2006 law that requires it to set aside an average of $5.5 billion annually for 10 years to finance retiree health costs for the next 75 years. The Senate bill would reduce that obligation, but Mr. Donahoe noted that even without such payments, his agency had an operating loss of $2.2 billion last fiscal year.
About 10 minutes into his speech, a handful of protesters stood at their table, declared, ''We are the 99 percent'' and shouted: ''Stop closing post offices. Stop breaking the postal unions. Hey, ho, Donahoe has got to go.'' On the sidewalk outside, about 30 union members chanted and held signs saying, ''Stop the Attacks Against Postal Workers.''
Early this year, Mr. Donahoe proposed closing up to 3,700 post offices, slashing the number of sorting facilities to 200 from 500 and trimming the agency's work force by 220,000 people, 120,000 of them by layoffs. Infuriating the postal unions, he said he would ask Congress to enact a law that would vacate the no-layoff clause in union contracts, a move the unions said would be unconstitutional.
Mr. Donahoe did not talk of layoffs in his speech on Monday. The management of the Postal Service is in talks with two major postal unions whose contracts expired on Sunday.
At a news conference after the luncheon, Fred Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, denounced the idea of layoffs and said his union was working hard with the Postal Service to hold down costs and develop ideas for new services and products that would generate revenue.
The Senate bill aims to make money available for the agency to trim its work force through buyouts, in part by returning several billion dollars that the postal service overpaid to a federal pension fund.
Because neither the House nor Senate has passed a bill, the two chambers have not yet worked on reconciling their differences. The Senate sponsors say their bill gives the agency much of what it needs.
Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and the chief sponsor of the House bill, criticized the agency on Monday, saying it had not made enough cuts and had long overestimated its supposed excess contributions to its pension plans.
Mr. Issa said his bill, which directs the Postal Service to consolidate facilities and reduce deliveries to five days, gives the postal service the tools its needs to fix its finances. He said accounting gimmicks, like returning the pension money, would give the agency only the ''flexibility to push back insolvency for a few more years.''

HEADLINE: A Hard Turn: Better Health On the Highway

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
After driving hundreds of miles, the last thing Roy Williams, a truck driver from Denton, Tex., wanted to do was exercise. After a day trapped in the cab, stopping only to gorge on greasy fare at truck stops, who could think of working out?
But once he ballooned to 405 pounds, he knew he had to make a change. So last year, Mr. Williams, 58, did something all too rare for someone in his profession: He embarked on a diet and exercise program.
The six-pack of Coca-Cola he drank each day? Gone. The hamburgers, chips and chocolate he relished? No more. Today, he drinks a protein shake mixed with ice water or soy milk for breakfast, nibbles cantaloupe and red grapes, and makes ''sandwiches'' with thinly sliced meat and cheese but no bread. He keeps a fold-up bike in his truck and zips around rest areas on his breaks.
His weight is down to 335 pounds, and he's managed to reduce the amount of blood pressure medication he takes. ''I rarely, maybe once a week, even go into a truck stop,'' said Mr. Williams, who has been navigating an 18-wheeler for the last 30 years. 
Mr. Williams's predicament is hardly unique. On the road for weeks on end, with the sorts of diets that make nutritionists apoplectic, the nation's truckers are in pretty bad shape. Now, beset by rising insurance costs and desperate to ensure their drivers pass government health tests, trucking companies and industry groups are working hard to persuade road warriors to change their habits.
It's a long haul, so to speak. Eighty-six percent of the estimated 3.2 million truck drivers in the United States are overweight or obese, according to a 2007 study in The Journal of the American Dietetic Association.
''Obesity is a terrible problem in the trucking industry,'' said Brett Blowers, director of marketing and development for the Healthy Trucking Association of America, an industry organization in Montgomery, Ala.
A few years ago, Mr. Blowers's group conducted a blood pressure screening of more than 2,000 drivers at an annual truck show. ''We sent 21 directly to the emergency room, and one of them had a heart attack on the way there,'' he recalled.
It's a problem not just for truckers, but for anyone who shares the road with them. In 2010, heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers accounted for 13 percent of all fatal occupational injuries, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A 2007 report from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration found that 87 percent of crashes involving truckers stemmed to some degree from driver error. Twelve percent of these cases were because the driver was asleep, had a heart attack, was in diabetic shock or had some other health problem.
''Of the accidents that are preventable, I'd say about 10 to 25 percent, if not higher, were from drivers who were tired, had sleep apnea or were not physically fit,'' said Chad Hoppenjan, director of transportation safety services at Cottingham and Butler, an insurance broker in Dubuque, Iowa.
The United States Department of Transportation requires drivers to pass a certifying medical exam every two years. Drivers are checked for severe heart conditions, high blood pressure and respiratory maladies, including sleep disorders.
While the statistics are bleak, they're not especially surprising. Driving is a sedentary activity. Most truckers are paid by the mile, so they tend to squeeze out every last second of the 11 hours they're allowed on the road in a 24-hour period.
''Some days I've driven 600 miles and didn't even stop,'' said Barb Waugh, 58, of Fairfax, S.D., one of an estimated 190,000 female truckers. In a typical week she logs 2,500 to 4,000 miles. ''I feel like a marshmallow because I don't get to exercise,'' said Ms. Waugh, who weighs about 300 pounds.
Routines that keep other Americans healthy -- hitting the gym, cooking at home, scheduling a doctor's appointment -- are nearly impossible, since drivers are rarely in one place for more than a day or two. The only exercise for many is pressing the gas pedal; most don't load and unload cargo.
When they do leave their vehicles, it's usually at truck stops and fast-food restaurants where nearly every option is greasy or fatty or served up in calorie-rich buffets -- which some truckers say stands for ''Big Ugly Fat Fellows Eating Together.''
''Everything's fried, fried, fried -- chicken, hot dogs, hamburgers, chili, burritos, corn dogs,'' said Bill Johnson, 50, of Lubbock, Tex., a 25-year industry veteran.
Jill Garcia, 50, a driver from San Antonio who is obese and has sleep apnea and hypertension, said: ''I swear, the truck stops have a candy-a-holic at their corporate offices. You can get two king-size bars for $3. I got four packs of M&M's for a buck.''
Until recently, few in the transportation industry cared to tackle its health issues. ''When you tried to talk to someone to connect the dots, they looked at you like you had three heads,'' said Bob Perry, founder of Rolling Strong, which offers health and wellness programs for truckers.
Now transportation carriers, industry organizations and even truck stops are unrolling initiatives to help truckers slim down, shape up and improve their health. Employers are holding health seminars, building on-site gyms, bringing in nutritionists and fitness trainers, and offering financial incentives to employees who stop smoking or lose weight. Some drivers are cooking in their rigs, walking or bike riding around truck stops, blogging about their experiences at sites like truckingsolutionsgroup.org and safetythruwellness.com, and writing books.
Lindora Clinic, which operates weight-loss centers, last year unveiled ''Lean for Life On-the-Road,'' a nutrition and exercise program for the trucking community. The company has teamed up with the Truckload Carriers Association, which represents 400 carriers, for a ''Trucker Weight Loss Showdown'' to begin in January. For two and a half months, 10 fleets, each composed of six drivers and six office workers, will exercise and follow low-carb, low-fat, moderate-protein diets.
This year, TravelCenters of America/Petro unrolled a program called StayFit, which includes fitness rooms, mapped walking trails and healthier foods at its stops. Snap Fitness, an international chain of 24-hour gyms, has announced plans to open a workout facility at one, and perhaps many more, of the 550 Pilot Flying J Travel Centers across the country.
While concern for driver health is certainly a force behind the wellness initiatives, economics also plays a role. The trucking industry is grappling with sky-high insurance rates and rising medical costs. The 2010 Cottingham and Butler Trucking Compensation and Benefits Benchmark Survey, an annual report for the trucking industry, found that deductibles and out-of-pocket costs to truck drivers and their employers are 40 percent to 70 percent higher than in other industries.
''It just keeps going and going, and you don't know how to control it,'' said Sidney Brown, chief executive officer of NFI, a logistics company in Cherry Hill, N.J. To help cut costs, his company has started quarterly wellness newsletters, free smoking cessation workshops, discounts with WeightWatchers and Anytime Fitness, and a companywide ''Biggest Loser'' competition.
The industry also is struggling to retain veteran drivers while recruiting new ones. According to Debbie Sparks, vice president of development for the Truckload Carriers Association, the industry is short about 150,000 drivers, and she expects that number to rise to 300,000 by next year. But nearly 40 percent of new drivers quit within their first 90 days.
''We've got to make ourselves more attractive to recruit a new generation of truck drivers,'' said Ms. Sparks.
Some of these programs have had modest success. Con-way Freight, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., has hired 46 full-time wellness coaches who rotate among 110 facilities. The company has seen a 32 percent reduction in workdays lost to injury, said Bob Petrancosta, its vice president of safety.
Several years ago, Trucks Inc., a regional carrier in Jackson, Ga., shifted to an annual Department of Transportation physical rather than bi-annual. It has since saved more than $250,000 in medical insurance costs diagnosed several pre-heart attack and pre-diabetic conditions among drivers. And a sleep apnea treatment program at Schneider National, based in Green Bay, Wis., has saved the company $651 per driver per month in health care costs since its inception in 2003.
Still, it's likely to be a long time before truckers are clamoring for steamed tofu and doing Sun Salutations at rest stops. ''Unless the driver is scared to death for their life, unless they've had a medical event, they're probably not going to change,'' said Michael Metzger, 37, whose Web site, Healthy Trucker Lifestyle, chronicles his weight-loss experience (70 pounds and counting) and offers recipes and exercise tips for drivers.
''You've got to go to them, and you've got to speak their language,'' said Mr. Perry of Rolling Strong. ''They truly don't want to be told what to do -- they have to feel that they're making this decision on their own.''
When the Lindora Clinic started working with truck drivers, recalled Cynthia Stamper Graff, the company's executive chairwoman, she often received beleaguered phone calls. ''The drivers said: 'I don't think we can do this. This is too difficult,' '' she recalled. ''The challenges of life on the road -- no structure, not being at home where you have a refrigerator, no proper food choices. And they weren't exercising.''
But slowly, she said, drivers embraced the company's 10-week program, which includes weekly phone consultations with a ''nurse coach'' and costs $360 a person, often paid wholly or in part by the employer. So far, the 75 drivers who have completed the program have shown an average loss of 8.4 percent from their starting weight.
Mr. Johnson signed up with Lindora this summer after hitting 226 pounds. Beforehand, his only exercise was ''walking into the truck stop restaurant, eating a bit and going back to the truck,'' he said.
Today he weighs about 208 pounds, and his truck doubles as a makeshift gym. He does sit-ups inside the trailer and pull-ups below. He fills a cooler with 60 pounds of ice and lifts it over his head 10 to 15 times. He power-walks around truck stops, some of which cover four or five acres, though he balks at the idea of using the area around his truck as a running track (32 laps around a rig is a mile, drivers are sometimes reminded).
''That's just goofy,'' he said.
Some drivers have even turned to private trainers. Kevin Melton, 39, a trucker in Black Mountain, N.C., used to snack on Snickers bars and three or four Little Debbie pies a day while driving. His weight shot to 260, his joints and back ached, and his cholesterol was ''through the roof.''
Two years ago, he began working with Chadwick Slagle, a trainer. Together they devised a nutrition plan: Mr. Melton now eats five meals a day, drinks water instead of soft drinks, and snacks on fruit and nuts. He wakes up at 4:30 a.m. to exercise, running on a treadmill or around a parking lot. He now weighs about 200 pounds and hopes to get down to 190.
He has had to rethink some of his beliefs. ''You hear Snickers are healthy because of the nuts, that they give you energy,'' he said. ''But when you read the label you realize they're surrounded by caramel.''
For Ms. Garcia, who recently joined WeightWatchers, a new lifestyle was an easy decision. She takes medication for high blood pressure, and she worries that the day will come when she won't pass her physical.
''I'm being stupid if I don't lose the weight,'' she said, ''because I'll lose my job.''

HEADLINE: Failure Is Absorbed With Disgust and Fear, But Little Surprise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Reporting was contributed by Ian Lovett, Steven Yaccino, Malia Wollan, Isolde Raftery, Robbie Brown and Allison Kopicki.

 BODY:
Does the American political system even work anymore?
Variations on that question kept coming up on Monday as Americans -- at least those paying attention -- absorbed the news that the Congressional committee charged with reducing the deficit had failed to even meet very often, let alone come up with a plan to get the country back in the black. From shoppers in Los Angeles to tourists in Atlanta to traders taking cigarette breaks outside the Chicago Board of Trade, the eye-rolling that often accompanies doings in Washington gave way to something bordering on dismay.
''My reaction when I heard they failed was more emotional than anything,'' said Elizabeth Weinraub, a 25-year-old retail manager, as she got her morning fix at a Los Angeles Starbucks. ''I'm not even sure what that means in the grand scheme. But it was a bum-out.'' 
The failure of the committee -- which had been dubbed, with typical inside-the-Beltway grandiosity, the ''supercommittee'' -- led to predictable, if bitter, kryptonite jokes. But it also prompted wrenching questions about whether Congress can be trusted to do its job: the committee, after all, was supposed to do the hard work that lawmakers had put off in August when they eventually agreed to avert default by raising the nation's debt limit, waiting so long to do so that Standard & Poor's lowered the United States's credit rating.
The idea of the committee was, in part, to save Congress from itself: let a dozen members forge a compromise to cut the deficit, and then put it to the whole Congress for an up-or-down vote. It was Congress lashing itself to the mast, like Odysseus, to resist the siren calls of lobbyists and special interest groups. But in the end, the ship went nowhere.
People were not just annoyed: they were worried. Neil Elkins, 52, who works on boats on the Seattle waterfront, said that the failure was ''endangering my confidence in our system of checks and balances.'' Khalfani Lawson, a 23-year-old student at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, said that the lack of progress was breeding apathy among the young. ''If it was a constructive process, people would be more inclined to be involved.'' And Ernest Wong, a 44-year-old from Los Angeles who works in marketing, put it bluntly: ''This makes me scared.''
Disgust with Congress even briefly seemed to unite members of the Occupy Wall Street protest movement and the traders they rally against.
Marco Amaral, a 20-year-old student at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been a protest organizer with Occupy Cal, bemoaned the failure of elected officials to come together in the nation's time of need. ''The failure of the supercommittee does not reflect poorly on Republicans, Democrats or Obama, it reflects poorly on how our system works in general,'' he said. ''Our democracy isn't working like it should.''
Half a continent away, some outside the Chicago Board of Trade had a decidedly different worldview but a similar gut reaction. Mark Rosenberg, a 33-year-old trader at Cydonia Capital, summed up the mood this way: ''Upstairs, they want to fire everyone in Congress because no one is doing their job.''
A record 84 percent of Americans said they disapproved of the way Congress was handling its job in the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll last month. That is the most since The Times first began asking the question in 1977, and a higher level of disapproval than was found after a political stalemate led to a federal government shutdown in 1995.
The flip side of the coin is no better: Congress's approval rating has sunk to 9 percent, the poll found, a record low. Senator Michael F. Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, created a chart showing that Congress now had less support than President Richard M. Nixon did during Watergate or BP did during the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
''I think the whole situation is nutty,'' said Jan O'Connell, a 47-year-old artist from Los Angeles. ''Somebody's got to save us, and if the government can't, who can?''
How the stalemate will play out politically is hard to gauge. Republicans on the committee rejected Democratic proposals that would have made cuts to entitlement programs, and held out for a deal that would have kept taxes on the wealthiest Americans low. Recent polls have found that nearly two-thirds of those surveyed support raising taxes on the wealthy.
And how the behind-the-scenes dealings of an obscure group of lawmakers in Washington will read after being retold by spin doctors in both parties is anyone's guess. A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found that American voters blame Republicans in Congress more than they do President Obama and Congressional Democrats by 44 percent to 38 percent, with a similar spread among independent voters.
In Chicago, Brian Leonard Jr., a trader for Belvedere Trading who is a Republican, said that confidence in the political system had been damaged. ''I think the Republicans need to step up and make this less about the election and more about the country as a whole,'' he said.
Many politicians and economists believed that expectations for a deal were so low that the market was already counting on the committee to fail. So when stocks fell sharply on Monday -- attributed partly to the crisis in Europe, but also partly to the collapse in Washington -- it came as an unpleasant surprise. Daniel Stecich, a trader with TJM Institutional Services in Chicago, said he blamed both parties for putting the economy at risk by not reaching a compromise that included both spending cuts and tax increases. ''They better do something to make this market calm down,'' he said.
Jerry Ross, 78, an independent voter from Tucson who voted for Senator John McCain for president in 2008, said he was disillusioned. ''I'm middle class, and I'm just annoyed by our politicians,'' he said outside a shopping center in Los Angeles, where he was visiting with his family. ''It's criminal really.''
Mr. Ross was concerned by the prospect of military cuts, which he called ''ridiculous.'' But he was flexible on the question of taxes. ''I think the idea of taxing the multimillionaires a little bit more is not the worst thing in the world,'' he said. ''They can certainly afford to pay a little bit more.''
In Atlanta, Micka Jones, a 71-year-old independent voter, said people should not be surprised at Washington's latest failure.
''Who thought it would be any different?'' she asked. ''The real news would be if they worked together.''

HEADLINE: Rising a Bit, Home Sales Stay Weak

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans who bought previously occupied homes rose slightly last month but remained at depressed levels. And more deals are being canceled at the last minute, a sign that even those who are looking to buy are worried about the housing market. 
Home sales rose 1.4 percent in October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. That's below the 6 million that economists say is consistent with a healthy housing market and slightly ahead of last year's sales -- the worst in 13 years.
The sales are measured when buyers close on the homes.
Many deals are falling apart before that point. One third of Realtors say they have had at least one contract scuttled in October, up from 18 percent in September.
Contracts have been canceled for a number of reasons: Banks have declined mortgage applications; home inspectors have found problems; appraisals showed a home was worth less than the bid; a buyer lost a job before the closing.
Still, the October increase in home sales beat analysts' expectations. Some economists took that as a positive sign for the troubled market.
''We are not looking for a housing renaissance, but the straws in the wind suggest that activity in the sector might be improving slightly,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.
Activity among first-time buyers rose slightly last month to make up 34 percent of sales. That's up from 32 percent in September.
At the same time, homes at risk of foreclosure made up 28 percent of sales last month. That's down from 30 percent in September. Many of the sales went to investors, who are increasingly buying homes priced under $100,000. Sales in that category have increased more than 24 percent over the last year while sales of more expensive homes have fallen.
The median sales price dropped about 2 percent, to $162,500, in October.

HEADLINE: Tax Write-Off Now, Charity Later

BYLINE: By RAY D. MADOFF. 
Ray D. Madoff, a professor at Boston College Law School, is the author of ''Immortality and the Law: The Rising Power of the American Dead.''

 BODY:
Newton, Mass.
THE failure of the bipartisan debt reduction committee to reach agreement means there are likely to be drastic cuts in federal spending that will result in many more Americans looking to the charitable sector to meet their needs. In the meantime, President Obama and Congressional Republicans have both proposed cutting the tax deduction for charitable giving as a way of generating much-needed federal revenue. But neither side is addressing a growing problem with charitable donations.
When most people think about charitable giving, they envision money going to support local food banks or educational organizations, or donations to the Red Cross that can be put to work immediately on disaster relief. But it is increasingly common for charitable donations to take a significant detour before ever being put to charitable use. 
More and more charitable dollars are now being directed to what are called ''donor-advised funds.'' Many of these funds are affiliated with large financial institutions like Fidelity, Schwab and Goldman Sachs, and hold, invest and eventually distribute dollars for charitable purposes. In the meantime, they generate significant management and investment fees for the institutions that house them, which have little incentive to speed up the distribution of resources to the charitable sector. Most important, there is no payout obligation; while donors receive the tax deduction as soon as they make their contribution, their money can languish in these charitable holding pens for decades or even centuries (these funds are frequently marketed for their ability to allow donors to create a legacy for future generations).
Why do people choose to give to these funds over traditional charities? Some like the flexibility of being able to claim a deduction now, while delaying the decision of which charities will eventually receive the money. Others like the fact that they don't have to keep track of receipts for multiple donations. But the bulk of these donations come from the wealthy, who often donate appreciated property -- thereby benefitting from a deduction for the full value of the property, while avoiding taxes on capital gains. Private foundations also use donor-advised funds. By law, private foundations are obligated to spend 5 percent of their assets every year for charitable purposes, and contributing to donor-advised funds is an easy way to fulfill that obligation.
Donor-advised funds are the fastest-growing charitable vehicle in the United States; they hold an estimated $25 billion. There are twice as many as there are private foundations. The largest of these funds, Fidelity Charitable, is the third largest charity in the country. And yet most Americans are not even aware that donor-advised funds exist.
Proponents of the funds point to their growth as a sign that they are adding resources to the charitable sector. However, data from the last 40 years show that charitable giving has remained remarkably constant, at around 2 percent of disposable income regardless of the economic climate. It appears more likely that the fund contributions are simply replacing what might otherwise have been outright contributions to charity. But instead of providing immediate relief to the needy and fuel to the economy by paying for goods and services, much of this money does nothing at all for an indefinite period. This is particularly troubling at a time when government cutbacks are going to make more people dependent on the charitable sector.
Congress long ago recognized that there is a difference between organizations that engage in charitable work and receive broad public support (public charities) and the private foundations that hold money for eventual charitable use. In 1969 it enacted rules to limit the tax advantages for contributions to private foundations and to establish minimum annual distribution requirements. But donor-advised funds are under no such limits or obligations, and even help private foundations to get around theirs.
Regardless of the level of deductions allowed for charitable giving, President Obama and Congress should take steps to ensure that money qualifying for the deduction goes to serve charitable causes within a reasonable period of time. The problem is not with charitable donors, who are simply following the rules provided for them, but rather with laws that fail to provide adequate guidelines for distribution.
To that end, Congress should enact rules that require donor-advised funds to distribute all of their assets to real public charities within seven years of their contribution. In addition, Congress should make clear that private foundations cannot meet their payout obligations by making gifts to donor-advised funds. Then we can have a real conversation about the best way to feed all those hungry people.

HEADLINE: Credit Risks In Europe Push Stocks Downward

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris and Julie Creswell from New York.

 BODY:
Stock prices and bond yields declined on Wall Street on Monday, as credit risks in Europe overpowered any market concerns over the failure in Washington to reach a deficit reduction package.
The joint Congressional committee charged with drafting deficit cuts said after the markets closed in New York that, as forewarned, it had failed to reach a deal to trim $1.2 trillion from government spending over 10 years, setting the stage for the automatic adoption of spending cuts starting in 2013.
But although the likely failure of the negotiations had revived the issue of the impact on the United States credit rating, analysts said they believed that by Monday, the markets had already priced in the result. 
''I think expectations are already pretty low,'' said Mihir P. Worah, a managing director at Pimco. ''I would tend to think what is happening in Europe is more influential today.''
The sovereign debt troubles remained front and center after Moody's Investors Service warned that France faced a fight to retain its AAA credit rating.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broad measure of the market, was down 1.86 percent to 1,192.98.
The Dow Jones industrial average was off 2.11 percent, or 248.85 points, at 11,547.31 and the Nasdaq composite index lost 1.92 percent.
But even with the stalemate in the ''supercommittee,'' a Treasury bond auction was heavily subscribed Monday, and the dollar and long-term bonds rallied.
''Because of the situation in Europe, there is a de-risking across the board,'' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. ''The sovereign debt problems and the lack of a credible, viable solution trumped the deficit problem in the U.S.''
After the market closed, Moody's and Standard & Poor's both affirmed their existing ratings on American government debt.
S.& P., which downgraded the country's AAA rating this summer based on what it saw as political brinksmanship, said the current AA+ rating would remain. Moody's said its AAA rating would remain, but so would its negative outlook.
Some investors said the rating agencies would likely now focus on any attempts by Congress to replace or modify the automatic deficit cuts, known as a sequester, before they go into effect in January 2013. Another rating agency, Fitch Ratings, which said in August that it expected to take negative action regarding the U.S. debt if the committee failed to reach a consensus, said Monday it expects to complete its review by the end of the month.
''This was supposed to be a forum to showcase that politicians could come together and come up with a meager -- which it really is -- $1.2 trillion in cuts and revenue raises,'' said Erik S. Weisman, a global bond portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management. ''This is new information for the market, and the market needs to assess whether it is more or less likely that a grand bargain can be reached after the elections.''
Investors, however, were divided on what might happen to yields even if the credit rating were downgraded. This summer, after the S.& P. downgrade, Treasury yields fell, but many said that was largely a reflection of investors fleeing the euro zone.
Others said no matter how bad the political and fiscal situation appeared in the United States, its prospects still looked brighter than in some countries in the euro zone.
David Coard, head of fixed income at the Williams Capital Group, noted that when Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' AAA credit rating in August, Treasury rates were low then as well.
''The flight to quality lives strong today,'' said Mr. Coard. ''We are still seeing a pretty strong bid for Treasuries out of the concern both for the European debt crisis and, to a lesser extent I think, the gridlock'' over the deficit committee.
In the bond market, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 11/32, to 100 10/32, and the yield fell to 1.97 percent on Monday, from 2.01 percent late Friday. Comparable German sovereign debt yielded 1.911 percent.
The yields on Spanish 10-year bonds rose to 6.472 percent on Monday, while the yield on Italian 10-year bonds held steady at 6.624 percent. The spreads between the French, Italian and Spanish yields, on the one hand, and the German yields, the European benchmark, on the other, have grown sharply this year, signaling market distrust of the bonds of euro zone members once thought to be safe.
The dollar was up against a range of currencies and the euro was little changed at $1.3534 from $1.3524 late Friday in New York.
''The market has been spooked over Europe and they are still not convinced that Europe is going to be able to pull out of this,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for Rockwell Global Capital.
Moody's warned in October that it might begin a review of France's AAA rating, which is considered the most fragile of the top-rated European governments, if growing bailout costs threatened to overstretch its finances. On Monday, Moody's said that rising borrowing costs and a deteriorating economic outlook were putting pressure on the nation's creditworthiness.
Losing its status as a AAA-rated borrower would mean France's borrowing costs would rise further and would weigh on the credit rating of the euro zone bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. Standard & Poor's already startled French officials when it erroneously sent an e-mail on Nov. 10 that suggested it had lowered the rating on France's sovereign debt.
''Elevated borrowing costs persisting for an extended period would amplify the fiscal challenges the French government faces amid a deteriorating growth outlook, with negative credit implications,'' Alexander Kockerbeck, a Moody's analyst, wrote in a weekly report, noting that weak economic growth would further weigh on the country's efforts to control spending.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
6:10 A.M. (HBO Signature) TWO FOR THE ROAD (1967) A successful architect (Albert Finney) and his wife (Audrey Hepburn, above, with Mr. Finney) travel through the South of France in their Mercedes-Benz 230 SL roadster while reminiscing about the various Continental excursions during their rocky, 12-year relationship. Stanley Donen directed this bittersweet British comedy, considered experimental at the time with its nonlinear juxtaposition of scenes past and present. Frederic Raphael wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay, and Henry Mancini composed the theme song, which he said was his favorite, with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse. ''What the film has to say about the state of matrimony and the restlessness of modern husbands and wives is more in the jumble of details and the eccentricity of the montage than it is in the exposition of a rational development,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times. ''The method'' -- which Mr. Crowther called just a lot of dazzle -- ''is the message, as it were.'' 
8 P.M. (CNN) CNN NATIONAL SECURITY DEBATE Wolf Blitzer moderates this Republican presidential debate, broadcast from DAR Constitution Hall in Washington. Mr. Blitzer and members from the debate's sponsors, the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, will pose questions to the candidates on national security, foreign policy and the economy.
8:30 P.M.

''While compromised by the uplift and affirmation that mainstream animation regurgitates like a mommy penguin,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times, this film ''also shows a remarkable persistence of vision.''

The love story, directed by Claude Sautet, ''is told with much lyricism, some passion and several bows to the style of 'Jules and Jim' and 'Two English Girls,' '' Roger Greenspun wrote in The Times. But despite a calmly beautiful Schneider and some exciting driving scenes, ''experiencing it all is somehow like exposure to very good, even subtle, table manners -- impressive but not too involving,'' he said, adding that the film ''generally remains on the surface, catching clues and missing sources, like the type of slick magazine fiction to which it belongs.''

Soon, he has made friends with a priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a prostitute (Violante Placido), who is so enamored of his prowess in bed that she stops charging him. The film, directed by Anton Corbijn from a script by Rowan Joffe, by ''filtering out any mention of the character's history and suppressing all but the tiniest indications of emotion, tries to strip the man to his essence,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''But there is not quite enough there: the still waters run very cool but not terribly deep, and 'The American' falls back into a view of its protagonist that is ultimately more sentimental than unsettling or intriguing.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Measures Set to Expire at Year's End Will Be Next Fiscal Battle

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The likely failure of the bipartisan Congressional deficit committee has opened the door for a year-end showdown on expiring stimulus measures that are adding billions of dollars to workers' pockets and, economists say, buoying the fragile recovery.
The committee had been charged with trimming federal deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years. But it had also considered continuing some temporary provisions -- a payroll tax reduction and an expansion of unemployment benefits -- given an unemployment rate stuck at 9 percent and anemic economic growth. 
With the committee deadlocked, Congressional Democrats and the White House intend to push for the two provisions on their own. President Obama is expected to argue for expanding the payroll tax cut and continuing additional support for the long-term unemployed at a speech in New Hampshire on Tuesday.
''If Congress fails to act, workers and small businesses won't get the tax cuts they need, the typical middle-class family will see its taxes increase by $1,000 next year, and millions of Americans looking for a job will be left out in the cold,'' said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, in an e-mail. ''The president won't be satisfied until Congress gets this done. ''
Republican Congressional aides said they anticipated that both measures would be extended, and that House and Senate leaders would push for them to be paid for by offsetting budget cuts, rather than adding to the budget deficit.
The unemployment insurance extension -- a temporary measure passed in the 2008 stimulus package and extended for another year last December -- grants additional weeks of unemployment benefits to jobless workers. In some high-unemployment states, including California and Nevada, jobless workers can receive up to 99 weeks of combined state and federal benefits. As of October 29, 3.5 million Americans were receiving federally funded additional weeks of benefits.
The payroll tax reduction cut workers' share of the tax that funds Social Security by 2 percentage points. A Tax Policy Center analysis estimates that 121 million workers kept an additional $934 in their paychecks over the course of the year, thanks to the cut.
Combined, the two measures cost the federal government an estimated $168 billion in 2011, helping families that took a hit to their incomes and an economy still ailing from lack of demand. In recent weeks, a broad range of private-sector economists have warned that allowing the measures to expire might be premature.
An analysis by Ben Garber, an economist with Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, cautioned against withdrawing stimulus too soon.
With the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and other measures, ''You're seeing a very rapid depletion of the budget deficit,'' Mr. Garber said in an interview. ''Historically, it is very extreme -- strict caps on spending with tax collection rapidly increasing. You're taking a weak economy and removing a large part of potential demand, which could be enough to tip us into recession.''
Other private-sector economists have issued similar projections. Goldman Sachs, for instance, found that eliminating the payroll tax cut threatens to reduce economic growth by two-thirds of a percentage point in 2012. Combined with the expiration of benefits for the long-term unemployed, the result on the economy would be ''intense, '' the Goldman report said.
And a Societe Generale analyst, Rudy Narvas, wrote in a note to clients on Friday that without the extension of about $180 billion in stimulus, ''the drag to G.D.P. could put the U.S. into recession'' in 2012.
Previously there was bipartisan support for extending both measures. But the Democrats and Republicans have diverged sharply on how to fund them. Many Republicans insist on ensuring that the two priorities are paid for by cutting from other programs or ending certain tax breaks.
Speaking on ''Fox News Sunday,'' Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, said that the deficit committee had been ''laser-focused on trying to get success'' on the payroll tax measure. But, he added, ''the bigger tragedy is we have unsustainable debt that is threatening our national security, is threatening our jobs, frankly, and is threatening our children's future.''
Many Democrats believe the two measures should be paid for by borrowing, thus increasing the government's net spending and injecting more short-term stimulus into the economy.
Several other provisions are expiring at the end of the year as well. For instance, physicians who see Medicare patients will see a 30 percent cut in reimbursements unless Congress acts.

HEADLINE: Pull of Family Reshapes U.S.-Cuban Relations

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- For two consecutive years, Stephanie Varcia, 11, a sixth grader here, has done something that was unimaginable five years ago. She has spent four weeks in Havana, playing hide-and-seek with her cousins and going to the beach with her aunts and uncles. When summer vacation ended, her mother flew out to bring her back to Miami.
Stephanie's stay in Cuba -- an increasingly common ritual among families that now includes trips to the island by unaccompanied minors -- is an emblem of the profound transformation in the relationship between Cuban-Americans in South Florida and Cubans in Cuba. Her vacation signals more than just a thaw in the bitter 50-year freeze between Cuba and the United States. It is an acknowledgment, in many respects, that the passage of time and the yearning for family have begun to overcome the caustic political stalemate that followed Fidel Castro's Communist revolution in 1959. Although South Florida Congressional members still support a hard line on Cuba, a position that plays well with older voters (the ones likeliest to vote), a majority of Cuban-Americans here have softened their attitudes. Many of them prefer to see more contact with people in Cuba, not less. 
''The truth is that the driver in policy is not the relationship between the United States and Cuba, but the relationship between Cubans, and that is far stronger than 50 years of intragovernment hostility,'' said Joe Garcia, a former chairman of the Miami Democratic Party. ''When you remove just some of the barriers, people do what people do: help their families.''
Despite the United States' commercial and economic embargo, imposed in 1960, ties between the two Cuban populations began to shift slowly a decade ago and have intensified in the past two years, a result of the Obama administration's move in 2009 to loosen travel and shipping restrictions. Recent decisions by the Cuban government allowing Cubans to own cellphones and computers, open small businesses and buy and sell cars and property have further solidified these ties.
But the biggest reason for the turnaround is the change in the profile of Cuban-Americans in South Florida. There are an estimated 300,000 Cuban-Americans in the United States who arrived after the mid-1990s, mostly through a special visa program. They now outnumber aging Cuban exiles from the 1960s, said Jaime Suchlicki, the director of the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami.
Unlike the exiles who fled Cuba in the 1960s and '70s, losing property, family and their homeland, this younger generation's web of immediate family members in Cuba is strong and wide.
So while they oppose Mr. Castro and are clear-eyed about Cuba's failings, family is their priority, not politics and ideology. The same is true even among some Cuban-Americans from earlier generations who have lost patience with Mr. Castro's longevity and a 50-year-old embargo that did not succeed in ousting him.
''The more recent arrivals aren't going to buy into isolation and confrontation because it means shutting out their relatives,'' said Fernand Amandi, of Bendixen & Amandi International, a public opinion research firm in Miami. ''So the ties are much closer today, people to people.''
The United States no longer limits the numbers of flights to Cuba that Cuban-Americans with family members there can make.
Last year, a record 320,000 people flew on charter flights to Cuba from Miami, according to Miami-Dade Aviation Department figures, many of them part of a younger, politically weary generation of Cuban-Americans. This year, the number is expected to be higher. Some of these passengers fly several times a year, dropping in for weddings, birthdays and holidays. They stay in touch through cellphones, e-mail (the Internet is still tightly controlled, but some Cubans use connections at universities and cybercafes in hotels) and even text messages (which can be routed through a third country).
For the first time, Cuban-Americans can send ''gift parcels,'' large shipments of not just food, clothes and medicine, but a variety of items that their families in Cuba can use to run new small private businesses. The tools, tires, Nintendo gadgets, cooking oil and commercial baking supplies sent from South Florida form the bedrock of the emerging carpentry shops, tire repair places, video game parlors, restaurants and bakeries on the island. And the new law allowing Cubans to buy and sell property is expected to lead to thousands of dollars being funneled to relatives by expatriates.
''In Washington, the whole debate over normalizing relations in Cuba is dead in the water,'' said Philip Peters, a Cuba expert at the Lexington Institute, a policy group. ''Meanwhile, in Miami, Cuban-Americans are normalizing relations one by one.''
Mr. Peters added: ''They are becoming a community of immigrants, who, like other immigrants in the United States, help those back home. And they do it regardless of politics.''
The transformation is palpable in other ways, too. Once lampooned for its intolerance, Miami's Cuban community now welcomes performers from the island, with little fuss. Ten years ago, those same musicians, confronted by protests, were forced to bypass the city. Today, Ache, a supper club across the street from Versailles -- the heartbeat of exile politics, where anti-Castro sentiment is served up with cafecitos -- hosts Cuban musicians. Los Van Van, a well-known band, played a raucous set there in September, mostly to old fans. In 1999, the band canceled a concert in Miami because of the furor. Versailles and the property where Ache sits are even owned by the Valls, a family of restaurateurs well known among exiles.
The same is true of Pablo Milanes, a famous Cuban singer who is fiercely disliked by Cuban exiles. He made his first visit to Miami this summer.
Even local Spanish-language television has adapted. It once featured a constant patter of hard-edged talk about Cuba and a parade of defectors and spies. But ratings began to drop recently, said Roberto Cespedes, producer of ''A Mano Limpia,'' a popular show on WJAN-CA, an independent station. Now the show also features reports about Afghanistan, crime and jellyfish -- in others words, general news.
The 2009 changes in the law have fueled a boom in shipping companies and charter flights. Cities like Fort Lauderdale, Tampa and San Juan, P.R., have started to fly to Havana in recent months. Chicago and Houston will soon join them. Cubamax, a popular travel agency, has grown to 35 employees from 4.
The flights are filled with people like Rey Garcia, 27, who arrived in Miami 11 years ago and has gone back to Cuba 14 times. ''Nobody stops me from visiting my family,'' Mr. Garcia said.
Mr. Garcia had stopped by No Que Barato in Hialeah, a store that sells discount items and ships them to the island, to ask about sending a band saw to Cuba. He and his father own a carpentry business and are helping his uncle set up one in Holguin, Cuba. He has already shipped an assortment of tools.
''I want to send a car motor, too,'' he added, with a smile.
But not everything has changed. Cuban-American members of Congress, most of them representing South Florida, would like to tighten travel rules, arguing that they enrich the Cuban government. But doing so may become more difficult.
''The majority of people don't want to move backward anymore,'' said Vicente Lanz, vice president at C&T Charters here. ''They want to move forward.''

HEADLINE: New Cases Of AIDS Hit Plateau

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
The world's AIDS epidemic has hit a plateau, with 2.7 million people becoming newly infected each year for the last five years, according to the annual report released Monday by U.N.AIDS, the United Nations agency fighting the disease.
Almost seven million people are receiving treatment -- more than half of them thanks to American taxpayers -- and that number has been steadily rising. But it is still not close to catching up to the new infection rate: Last year, 1.35 million got on treatment for the first time, meaning 200 people were newly infected for each 100 newly treated. 
That is an improvement over two years ago, when 250 were infected for each 100 treated.
And, in a development that augurs badly for the future, donor funds dropped about 10 percent last year as the worldwide economic crisis made some countries cut their donations.
Whether the world's generosity is producing a triumph or a failure depends on what yardstick is used. The seven million receiving treatment represent about half the people sick enough to need immediate treatment under World Health Organization guidelines. But the figure falls far short of reaching the ambitious new ''test and treat'' goal adopted last year by U.N.AIDS and endorsed this month by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in her speech calling for an ''AIDS-free generation.'' To reach that, all 34 million infected people in the world would have to be found -- a Sisyphean task in itself -- and then put on antiretroviral drugs immediately so they would stop passing the virus on.
(Moreover, they would all need to be on newer drugs like tenofovir, while at present many are still getting the old, cheap ones with harsh side effects.)
U.N.AIDS officials tried to put an optimistic spin on the report.
Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, the agency's chief of strategy, said AIDS had seen a ''game-changing year in science,'' noting especially a study showing that people on drugs lowered by 96 percent their chances of passing on the infection. And he highlighted areas where progress had been made.
Almost half the world's pregnant women with H.I.V. get at least one drug to help prevent passing the virus to their children.
Eleven poor or middle-income countries now treat more than 80 percent of their infected citizens. That is about as well as the United States does, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assumes that 20 percent of infected Americans do not know they are infected. The 11 countries are: Botswana, Cambodia, Chile, Comoros, Croatia, Cuba, Guyana, Namibia, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Slovakia.
Also, in 22 countries new infections have declined. Epidemiologists credit several factors: Fear of death stems some reckless behavior; safe-sex education is slowly growing; and the surging number of people on AIDS drugs, especially in southern Africa, means more people with lower viral loads who are thus less likely to infect others.
Despite improvement in Africa, new infections remain stuck at 2.7 million a year worldwide because Asia and Eastern Europe are doing so badly. Those epidemics are driven by drug addicts, who are notoriously hard to reach, and also by groups like gay men and prostitutes who in conservative societies lack the political clout that would let them demand drugs and who fear police crackdowns and therefore have furtive, rapid sex -- a high-risk behavior.
Studies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia show that many drug users avoid clinics even when they need medical care for fear they will be turned in to the police.
The report drew a contrast between Dhaka, where the Bangladeshi government introduced measures like clean-needle swaps, and St. Petersburg, where the Russian government would not. Infections among drug users dropped 25 percent in Dhaka and doubled in St. Petersburg. Despite its conservative Islamic government, Iran has done particularly well at stopping infections among its addicts by creating a network of 600 clinics that offer clean needles and methadone-type therapy.
The report is unusually blunt for a United Nations agency in that it directly compares countries with one another. Cambodia, for example, has lowered infections far faster than its richer neighbor Vietnam because it targeted its sex tourism industry while Vietnam has shied away from helping the drug users and gay men who drive its epidemic.
Brazil and Russia both have economies of similar size and both spend about $700 million a year on AIDS, but Brazil does far better because it concentrates on high-risk groups like gay prostitutes. Russia made ''largely a political decision'' not to help its drug injectors, Dr. Schwartlander said. ''That's not cost-efficient.''
Countries where homosexuals face jail or execution will never address their epidemics, he said, because gay men will stay hidden.
Many countries doing poorly have large populations, so even though their infection rates are lower than Africa's, they have large epidemics. In Egypt, Iran, Pakistan and Ukraine, for example, less than 20 percent of those needing treatment are getting it. In Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Russia, less than 40 percent are.
Up to half the children infected at birth, the report said, get infected because their mothers avoid testing for fear that the nurses or their neighbors will sneer at them. The report endorsed H.I.V. home-testing kits, which use a cheek swab or a finger prick, cost pennies and give results in minutes.
Global AIDS leaders, including Michel Sidibe, the executive director of U.N.AIDS, are urging countries to rely less on donors. He regularly praises South Africa, which pays 80 percent of its own costs.
The medical charity Doctors Without Borders has noticed several countries making plans to start people on drugs earlier in their illnesses; they include Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Uganda, South Africa and Zambia.
''They're signaling they want to move faster,'' said Sharonann Lynch, the charity's AIDS policy adviser. ''But none of them can do it without outside support, except for maybe South Africa.''

HEADLINE: Low-Tax Cigarettes, Made In Store, Draw City Lawsuit

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Tim Stelloh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, as Freud supposedly said, but when is a cigarette a cigarette?
The city filed suit last week against a ''roll your own'' cigarette shop in Chinatown and a related one on Staten Island, where a pack of cigarettes can cost less than $5, because the stores are not collecting cigarette taxes. The stores, both called Island Smokes, do not sell packs of Marlboros and Newports. Instead, they sell loose tobacco and cigarette papers, and have machines that let customers fabricate their own cigarettes.
Such stores operate in a legal gray area, arguing that because they do not sell prepackaged cigarettes, they are subject only to taxes on loose tobacco, which are far less. But according to the city, the shops are effectively selling cigarettes and should be forced to charge the full state and city taxes -- currently $5.85 per pack, which has pushed the cost of most packs in New York City to more than $10. 
''By selling illegally low-priced cigarettes,'' said the city's lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, ''defendants not only interfere with the collection of city cigarette taxes, they also impair the city's smoking cessation programs and impair individual efforts at smoking reduction, thereby imposing higher health care costs on the city and injuring public health.''
Jonathan Behrins, a lawyer for the companies that own the shops, said Monday that the stores were not obligated to charge cigarette taxes because ''we are not producing cigarettes for resale.''
''We are selling the contents that produce the cigarette,'' he said, ''and it's up to the user to make them.''
Mr. Behrins acknowledged that employees sometimes assist customers by ''demonstrating'' the equipment, but likened the whole process to ''making your own beer.''
The city offered a much different analogy.
''When you go to a salad bar, they sell you a salad, not a salad assembly process,'' said Eric Proshanksy, deputy chief of the corporation counsel's affirmative litigation division. ''When customers walk out of these stores, they have finished cigarettes and they bought them in those stores. The stores also have signage that calls them a discount cigarettes shop.''
Inside the Island Smokes on Eldridge Street in Chinatown, plastic bins contain different styles of loose tobacco -- menthol, double menthol, ultra light and more. More than a dozen machines are spread out in two rooms.
On Monday an employee showed a first-time buyer how the machines work. The customer attaches an empty paper tube to the machine and punches a ''load'' button; after the cigarette is full, it must be placed in another machine resembling an electric pencil sharpener that seals the ends. The pack cost $6, including the small tin box that holds the finished cigarettes; a refill is $4.50.
One man entered and asked if he could buy a pack of Newports. When told that Island Smokes sold only its own tobacco and that customers had to roll their own cigarettes, the man promptly left.
Customers who were rolling cigarettes swore by the shop's products, which are advertised as ''all natural.''
''It's such a better, cheaper alternative,'' said Veronica Raccuia, 20. The store says its tobacco does not contain additives found in premade cigarettes. ''You don't taste all the chemicals,'' she said.
Customers were frustrated to learn of the city's lawsuit against the shop, saying it was simply another measure intended to regulate people's lives.
''The government is so money-hungry they'll do anything to get rid of whoever they're not getting money from,'' Ms. Raccuia said.
''Just leave people alone,'' she added. ''In this economy, no one can barely afford food, let alone a pack of $15 cigarettes.''

HEADLINE: Separating You and Me? 4.74 Degrees

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF and SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
The world is even smaller than you thought.
Adding a new chapter to the research that cemented the phrase ''six degrees of separation'' into the language, scientists at Facebook and the University of Milan reported on Monday that the average number of acquaintances separating any two people in the world was not six but 4.74.
The original ''six degrees'' finding, published in 1967 by the psychologist Stanley Milgram, was drawn from 296 volunteers who were asked to send a message by postcard, through friends and then friends of friends, to a specific person in a Boston suburb. 
The new research used a slightly bigger cohort: 721 million Facebook users, more than one-tenth of the world's population. The findings were posted on Facebook's site Monday night.
The experiment took one month. The researchers used a set of algorithms developed at the University of Milan to calculate the average distance between any two people by computing a vast number of sample paths among Facebook users. They found that the average number of links from one arbitrarily selected person to another was 4.74. In the United States, where more than half of people over 13 are on Facebook, it was just 4.37.
''When considering even the most distant Facebook user in the Siberian tundra or the Peruvian rain forest,'' the company wrote on its blog, ''a friend of your friend probably knows a friend of their friend.'' The caveat there is ''Facebook user'' -- like the Milgram study, the cohort was a self-selected group, in this case people with online access who use a particular Web site.
Though the study was by far the largest of its kind, it raised questions about definitions of terms like ''friend'' on Facebook.
A Microsoft study in 2008, using a more conservative definition of friend, found an average chain of 6.6 people in a group of 240 million who exchanged chat messages. Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft researcher who led the study in 2008, said that network was based on people who exchanged messages, rather than those who identified as ''buddies.''
''There is an issue of how many friends you actually have,'' he said. But, he said, the Internet might have altered the definition.
''My own notion of what a friend is has evolved,'' he said.
Jon Kleinberg, a computer science professor at Cornell and a faculty adviser to an author of the new study, said some links might be more meaningful than others.
He offered the example of a man wanted for a crime. A random Facebook user might discover that she took a class with someone who rented an apartment from someone who grew up with the suspect. They may all be connected as Facebook ''friends.''
''We are close, in a sense, to people who don't necessarily like us, sympathize with us or have anything in common with us,'' Dr. Kleinberg said. ''It's the weak ties that make the world small.''
Still, he noted that such ties were hardly meaningless. ''We should ask what things spread well on weak ties,'' he said. ''News spreads well on weak ties. Those people I met on vacation, if they send me some cool news, I might send that to my friends. If they send me something about a protest movement, I might not.''
Matthew O. Jackson, an economist at Stanford who studies social networks, raised questions about the bias built into a study based on random samples. He said the study confirmed Facebook's success in being where millions of people communicate. ''It's more evidence that they've been enormously successful at connecting a large number of people very well,'' he said.
The research underscores the growing power of the emerging science of social networks, in which scientists study the ways people interact by crunching gigantic sets of Internet data.
''These social network tools provide individuals with tremendous reach,'' said Dr. Horvitz, the Microsoft researcher. ''People can share ideas with only a few jumps to a large portion of the world's population and with even fewer steps to the entire population of a nation.''
In addition to social scientists, a new generation of Internet commerce is using social network research to market products, and Pentagon sleuths are using similar techniques to identify networks of insurgents.
The ''six degrees'' concept dates to a 1929 short story, ''Chains,'' in which Frigyes Karinthy, the Hungarian author, suggested that no one is more than a string of six friends away from any other person.
After Milgram published his famous paper ''The Small World Problem,'' in 1967, the playwright John Guare made ''Six Degrees of Separation,'' the title of a 1990 play that explored Milgram's premise. And that gave rise to the parlor game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, in which disparate Hollywood personalities are linked to one another. (Elvis Presley was in ''Change of Habit'' with Edward Asner; Mr. Asner was in ''J.F.K.'' with Kevin Bacon.)
The Facebook paper, titled ''Four Degrees of Separation,'' notes that Milgram posed both an optimistic interpretation of his findings and a pessimistic one.
On one hand, it is a startling notion that reaching someone on the other side of the world takes only a small group of social connections. On the other hand, Milgram said, the result could also be evidence of psychological distance: that we were actually, on average, five ''worlds apart.''
''From this gloomier perspective,'' the new paper says, ''it is reassuring to see that our findings show that people are in fact only four worlds apart, and not five.''

HEADLINE: A Rare Isotope Helps Track an Ancient Water Source

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Nubian Aquifer, the font of fabled oases in Egypt and Libya, stretches languidly across 770,000 square miles of northern Africa, a pointillist collection of underground pools of water migrating, ever so slowly, through rock and sand toward the Mediterranean Sea.
The aquifer is one of the world's oldest. But its workings -- how it flows and how quickly surface water replenishes it -- have been hard to understand, in part because the tools available to study it have provided, at best, a blurry image.
Now, to solve some of the puzzles, physicists at the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois have turned to one of the rarest particles on earth: an elusive radioactive isotope usually ricocheting around in the atmosphere at hundreds of miles an hour.
Their first success was in distilling these elusive isotopes, krypton 81, from the water in the huge Nubian Aquifer, part of which lies two miles below the oases of western Egypt where temples honor Alexander the Great. Their second was in holding these isotopes still and measuring how much they had decayed since they last saw sunlight. 
Knowing how long water has been underground helps researchers understand how fast aquifers are recharged by surface water and how fast they move, leading to more accurate geological models. Groundwater is becoming an increasingly crucial component of the world's available fresh water, and the findings could significantly increase understanding of how it behaves.
Pradeep Aggarwal, who runs the isotope hydrology section of the International Atomic Energy Agency's water resources program, said that success in tracking older bodies of water had long been elusive. Carbon 14 dating, so useful in archaeology, reaches back just 50,000 years or so.
It is now clear that the Nubian Aquifer has been a million years in the making.
''For decades we have been looking at different means of fingerprinting water,'' Dr. Aggarwal said. ''We used a bunch of different isotopes -- stable isotopes -- to trace where the rain comes from. We also used the radioisotopes to figure how quickly groundwater moves.''
For years, scientists had relied on carbon 14 dating indicating the aquifer was just 40,000 years old. They knew that krypton 81, an isotope present in the open air but not underground, would be a better marker for the forensic work of tracking underground water's movement. When water loses contact with air, the radioactive clock starts; the isotope decays by a factor of two every 230,000 years, and the decay is measurable as far back as two million years.
But the krypton 81 isotopes were devilishly difficult to isolate and even more difficult to catch.
Zheng-Tian Lu, a physicist at the Argonne laboratory, and his colleagues have spent 14 years mastering and extending techniques to slow down atoms, the same laser-based techniques that were pioneered by the current energy secretary, Steven Chu, in the 1980s, and for which he won a Nobel prize.
When Dr. Lu realized the potential benefit of isolating krypton 81 isotopes, ''I got hooked on the problem,'' he said. ''I tried to use the trapping method I'd already learned to try and solve the radio-krypton dating problem.
''We are combining the ability to control and manipulate atoms to select krypton 81 out of a million kinds of krypton isotopes,'' he added. There is one krypton atom in every million molecules of water; one in a trillion of these krypton atoms is the krypton 81 isotope.
The key, he said, is using lasers to pinpoint the frequency at which atoms oscillate -- a loose equivalent of trying to determine the exact pitch of a musical note. Detecting the infinitesimal differences in isotopes' resonance is hard, but when done, lasers can be tuned to pick up each isotope's frequency. When krypton 81 atoms go through a laser attuned to them, they glow brightly and slow down, giving scientists an easier target to isolate.
The process begins when water is extracted from the aquifer without any contact with air. Krypton is bled from the water into a vacuum system. Once identified and slowed, the krypton 81 isotopes are trapped by six laser beams focusing on them from the four cardinal points of the compass and from above and below. Then their decay can be measured.
''From this aging information, you are looking at how the water flowed in the long past,'' Dr. Lu said. ''But it does have implications about how to manage waters today.'' He added, ''To manage a water resource you need to build a realistic hydrology model.''
That is where Neil C. Sturchio, a geologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, comes in. He works with the most accepted model of how water flows through the Nubian Aquifer. ''The reason this model was done,'' he said, ''is that there is an international agreement among the countries that share this water'' -- Egypt, Libya, Chad and Sudan.
''The issue is if Libya is starting to pump on their water seriously and Egypt is doing the same thing in their oasis areas,'' what happens to the rest of the aquifer? If heavy pumping comes too close to a coastline, saltwater may be drawn into the hydrologic depression created by the pumping.
The Nubian Aquifer is not exactly running dry; it is filled with the equivalent of more than 500 years of Nile River flow; the groundwater in the Egyptian portion alone is estimated to exceed 10,000 cubic miles.
Nonetheless, Dr. Aggarwal of the International Atomic Energy Agency pointed out: ''As a result of the drawdown we have dried up the oases in a couple of places. In Libya they have dried up Kufra Lake.'' In 1920, he said, National Geographic published a picture of the lake at high water. ''Right now it is a dry bed, because they are pumping so heavily,'' he said.
And even though the aquifer is huge, its recharge rate, at best, ''is measured in millimeters per year,'' Dr. Aggarwal said -- tiny compared with what is being pumped out.
In addition, Dr. Sturchio said, there remains the question of how best to extract water: ''where you put wells, how deep, how close to each other.''
''If you design it the right way, you can get a lot more water without problems,'' he went on. ''But if you put all the wells in one spot, you could be causing yourself a lot of trouble.''
Water managers around the world will find the team's information useful, he predicts.
In addition to being applied to other aquifers in places like the Philippines and Australia, the krypton 81 techniques are being explored as a way of tracking underground brine in places like southeastern New Mexico, where radioactive waste from ships, submarines and aircraft carriers is stored underground.
In the end, management of nuclear waste, like management of water, is a political matter. ''There are a lot of different calculations that go into exploiting a resource,'' Dr. Aggarwal said. ''In most cases, decisions of whether to use or not to use, or how much to use, are social, political and economic decisions.''
Still, he said, ''the more reliable info we can provide for making those decisions, the better off we are -- what we want to do is get the most accurate information possible.''

HEADLINE: California's Campus Movements Dig In Their Heels

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- It has become something of an annual tradition on California college campuses, in what is perhaps the most prestigious state university system in the country: the state makes large cuts in public universities, they in turn raise tuition, and students respond with angry protests.
But this year, propelled in part by the fervor of the Occupy Wall Street movement and in part by the state of the economy and California's mountainous budget woes, the battle is sharpening. Indeed, the Occupy movement -- on campuses, at least -- is transforming itself into a student-led crusade against increases in tuition. 
A video that showed two University of California, Davis, police officers using pepper spray on seated protesters has gone viral, with hundreds of thousands watching what might have been a relatively small encampment compared with the larger protests across the country. The video has led to demands that Chancellor Linda P. B. Katehi resign. On Monday, Ms. Katehi said she was putting the campus police chief on administrative leave as a way to rebuild trust on campus.
The attack has galvanized protesters on other campuses. Students at the Los Angeles, Berkeley, Riverside and Davis campuses said Monday that they intended to restart their encampments Monday night, in part to test whether they will be rousted or arrested in the wake of the pepper-spraying.
After years of watching the state's budget for higher education erode, they are demanding that the state and university administrators find a way to lower tuition that they say is squeezing out the middle class.
''These are institutions that we call the people's university, but all of us who are in it have just watched this thing collapse on itself being starved for resources year after year,'' said Lillian Taiz, the president of the California Faculty Association, the union that represents professors in the California State University system. ''What keeps happening is that we are turning the university into a place where really only the wealthy can go. The students are watching their parents fall out of the middle class and watching their own ability to move into it be sabotaged.''
Tuition at the University of California has nearly doubled over the last several years, and next year the system will collect more money from student tuition than from state revenues. And with the state budget situation worsening by the month, the Legislature seems likely to impose another $200 million in higher education cuts next year. Last week, the California State University Board of Trustees approved a 9 percent tuition increase, even as it cuts courses and student services.
''For the last several years, the debate has been what are we going to cut, but we need to change the conversation to who is going to pay for public education?'' said Kyle Arnone, one of the protest organizers at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a graduate student in sociology. ''We are forcing people to consider the financing of education in a larger context.''
Like many of the organizers involved in the protest, Mr. Arnone is a member of the union that represents graduate students. The union is part of a coalition of labor groups and other organizations that are pressing to close a loophole in the state's property taxes and to increase taxes on the state's wealthiest residents. Mr. Arnone said the organization hoped to pressure the regents who oversee the system's budget to sign a pledge backing the changes in the state's tax system.
Mr. Arnone said he expected dozens of students to camp at U.C.L.A. overnight Monday. At the same time, other students are planning to camp out and guard a Bruin statue, the campus mascot. The statue is often vandalized this time of year, ahead of the football game against the school's cross town rival, the University of Southern California. ''We're going to make them deal with whether they'll selectively enforce their laws.''
The University of California president, Mark G. Yudof, convened a conference call with the chancellors of all 10 campuses, urging them not to use police force to respond to ''peaceful, lawful protests,'' said Daniel M. Dooley, a senior vice president for the system who participated in the call. The president also plans to create protocols to detail how the campuses should respond to the ongoing protest.
Mr. Dooley said that he did not expect Ms. Katehi to resign and that President Yudof had confidence that she could move the campus beyond the incident.
Thousands of people gathered on the Davis campus for a noon rally Monday where Chancellor Katehi spoke. Organizers of the protest there told her she should wait in line with other speakers.
''I am here to apologize. I feel horrible for what happened on Friday,'' she told the crowd. ''I don't want to be the chancellor of the university we had on Friday.''
She added: ''I know you may not believe anything I am telling you today, and you don't have to. It is my responsibility to earn your trust.''
Administrators in the U.C. system have long complained about the state's budget cuts and in many ways are sympathetic to the protesters' demands.
''The rapidly rising fees give us all heartburn,'' said Gibor Basri, the vice chancellor for equity and inclusion at Berkeley, who has met with the protesters several times. ''We don't believe that higher education is a private right but a public good.''
Mr. Basri added: ''The problem is that the protesters aren't one group. We've got protesters who want to take the place down, and we have very responsible student leaders and everybody in between. When it gets tangled up with how the university responds, it makes things more complicated.''
Online Correction: November 21, 2011, Monday
An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the vice chancellor for equity and inclusion at the University of California, Berkeley. His name is Gibor Basri, not Gibor Bafri.

HEADLINE: As Layoffs Rise, Stock Buybacks Consume Cash

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
When Pfizer cut its research budget this year and laid off 1,100 employees, it was not because the company needed to save money.
In fact, the drug maker had so much cash left over, it decided to buy back an additional $5 billion worth of stock on top of the $4 billion already earmarked for repurchases in 2011 and beyond.
The moves, announced on the same day, might seem at odds with each other, but they represent an increasingly common pattern among American corporations, which are sitting on record amounts of cash but insist that growth opportunities are hard to find.
The result is that at a time when the nation is looking for ways to battle unemployment, big companies are creating fewer jobs, and critics say they are neglecting to lay the foundation for future growth by expanding into new businesses or building new plants. 
What is more, share buybacks have not fulfilled their stated purpose of rewarding investors over the last decade, experts say. ''It's a symptom of a deeper problem, which is a lack of investment in the long term,'' said William W. George, a Harvard Business School professor and former chief executive of Medtronic, a medical technology company. ''If we're not investing in research, innovation and entrepreneurship, we're going to be a slow-growth country for a decade.''
Liberal critics insist the trend is another example of top corporate executives raking in an inordinate share of the nation's wealth, even as their employees suffer.
''It's an extraordinarily unimaginative way to use money,'' said Robert Reich, a former secretary of labor under President Clinton who now teaches public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. After diving in the wake of the financial crisis, buybacks have made a remarkable comeback in recent years, with $445 billion authorized this year, the most since 2007, when repurchases peaked at $914 billion.
But spending on capital investments like new plants and infrastructure has stagnated more broadly in corporate America, confounding efforts by the Obama administration to spur economic growth. Capital expenditures by companies on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are expected to total $546 billion in 2011, down from $560 billion in 2008, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters Eikon.
The principle behind buybacks is simple. With fewer shares in circulation, earnings per share can rise smartly even if the company's underlying growth is lackluster. In many cases, like that of the medical device maker Zimmer Holdings, executives are able to meet goals for profit growth and earn bigger bonuses despite poor stock performance.
''It's clear there's a conflict of interest,'' said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ''Unless earnings per share are adjusted to reflect the buyback, then to base a bonus on raw earnings per share is problematic. It doesn't purely reflect performance.''
In addition, executives, who are often large shareholders, stand to benefit from even a small, short-term jump in stock prices.
Earlier this month, Pfizer increased its estimate for stock repurchases this year to between $7 billion and $9 billion -- essentially spending in one year nearly all of the money it set aside in February for multiyear buybacks. There has been a steady drumbeat of other companies laying off workers even as they have disclosed plans to buy back more stock. On June 23, Campbell Soup said it would buy back $1 billion in stock; five days later it announced plans to eliminate 770 jobs. Hewlett-Packard announced a $10 billion stock repurchase in July, and jettisoned 500 jobs in September after it discontinued its TouchPad and smartphone product lines.
Last month, the first layoffs began at Zimmer's plant in Statesville, N.C., which is due to shut early next year. The company made splints and tourniquets there for more than three decades. For the sewing machine operators and the rest of the 124 workers at the plant, it is bad news, but it is a different story for Zimmer's top executives.
Powered by huge stock buybacks -- the company bought $500 million worth of its own shares last year, more than twice what it spent on research and development -- Zimmer posted earnings growth of 10 percent a share, even though operating income and revenue grew by less than 5 percent in 2010.
That helped its senior management, including the chief executive, David C. Dvorak, collect millions in cash and stock incentive payments by meeting earnings-per-share goals. For example, 50 percent of Mr. Dvorak's $1.03 million cash bonus was tied to achieving per-share earnings of $4.28 in 2010. The company earned $4.33, but without the share repurchases the company would have made $4 to $4.10 a share.
Investors have not rewarded the strategy, however: Zimmer's shares have dropped 32 percent in the last five years, while Pfizer's are down 30 percent in the same period.
Over the last decade, in fact, companies that spent the most on repurchases had a total shareholder return of 37 percent versus 127 percent for companies that spent the least, according to research by Gregory V. Milano, chief executive of Fortuna Advisors, which consults with companies on how to raise their share price over the long term.
In the cases of Pfizer and Zimmer, analysts say the rush to buy back shares crimped development of new products, a prime reason that both companies are experiencing slow revenue growth.
Despite the looming expiration of the patent for its best-selling drug, Lipitor, Pfizer spent more than $20 billion repurchasing shares from 2005 to 2010.
''In that era, it wasn't the best use of cash,'' said Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse. ''They should have been doing more to fix the company.''
Matthew Dodds, an analyst with Citigroup, said, ''Zimmer has shown little appetite for acquisitions or diversification, yet they don't sport a pipeline that can drive investor interest.''
Nevertheless, Zimmer is on track to repurchase $1 billion worth of its shares this year, double last year's pace, and it actually borrowed money last quarter to achieve its goal.
In a statement, Zimmer said its bonus programs were ''designed to pay for performance,'' and that overall compensation strategy was ''designed to align the interests of its employees and stockholders.'' Zimmer is committed to research and development and the introduction of new products, the company said, adding that the factory closure in North Carolina, while difficult, ''is in the best interest of the company's stockholders.''
Pfizer declined to make an executive available to discuss its policy. But in a statement, the company said it ''remains committed to returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments.''
As for the cut in research spending in February, Pfizer said it has ''accelerated our research strategy and made important changes to concentrate our efforts to deliver the greatest medical and commercial impact.''
In a conference call with analysts this month, Pfizer's chief executive, Ian C. Read, said his company would ''continually look'' for acquisitions that would increase revenue growth. But in deciding how to use the proceeds from recent asset sales, he said ''the case to beat is share repurchase.''
Financial institutions, which bought back huge amounts of stock over the last decade at share prices far higher than they are today, do not seem to have learned their lesson either. JPMorgan Chase, for example, spent $4.4 billion repurchasing shares in the third quarter even as its stock fell more than 25 percent.
Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, actually apologized for the move last month, conceding: ''It would have been wise to wait. We're sorry.''

HEADLINE: With Collapse of Panel's Work, Battleground Shifts to the Automatic Cuts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER, HELENE COOPER and ROBERT PEAR; Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Leaders of the Congressional committee charged with finding at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions conceded on Monday that panel members had failed, setting up what is likely to be a yearlong political fight over the automatic cuts to a broad range of military and domestic programs that would go into effect starting in 2013 as a result of their inability to reach a deal.
Speaking an hour after the committee's failure was announced by its leaders in an e-mail statement, President Obama promised to veto any legislation that seeks to avoid the automatic cuts. The president also pledged that ''one way or another'' the deficit would be trimmed by at least $2.2 trillion, the only question being whether it was with a ''scalpel, not a hatchet.''
''There will be no easy off-ramps on this one,'' Mr. Obama said. His reference to $2.2 trillion includes $1 trillion in savings that both parties agreed to in August. 
The committee's failure appeared to alarm some state officials. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo held a conference call with his Council of Economic and Fiscal Advisors to discuss the impact on the state, which he said ''could lose approximately $5 billion in federal funding over 10 years beginning this coming fiscal year.''
The panel's demise followed more than 10 weeks of bitter partisan division that seemed to seal the image of Congress, and all of Washington, as a place where nothing can be accomplished, even when the consequences of failure are clearly visible to the American people and abhorrent to both political parties.
In a statement, the panel's leaders, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said, ''After months of hard work and intense deliberations, we have come to the conclusion today that it will not be possible to make any bipartisan agreement available to the public before the committee's deadline.''
The statement left open the possibility of a new stage of negotiations in the full Congress, where lawmakers will try to hammer out an agreement on a tax overhaul, changes to entitlement programs and new revenues as a way to avoid automatic across-the-board cuts over 10 years. ''We remain hopeful that Congress can build on this committee's work and can find a way to tackle this issue in a way that works for the American people and our economy,'' it said.
Short-term matters, like the expiration at the end of this year of a payroll tax cut and jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, will most likely be dealt with in stand-alone legislation or as bill amendments next month. But given the depth of the divisions between the parties, there is no guarantee of an agreement.
And a meeting of the minds on two central points -- the scheduled expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which Republicans oppose, and scaling back entitlement programs, which Republicans accuse Democrats of having approached too modestly -- seemed on Monday like a mirage.
Democrats in the Senate said they planned to use the Bush tax cuts, which expire at the end of next year, as leverage in future attempts to avoid large cuts to the budget.
Many Republicans said they would try to find a way to spare at least some of the automatic $500 billion in reductions to the Pentagon budget over the next 10 years. Representative Howard P. McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said on Monday that he would soon introduce legislation ''to prevent cuts that will do catastrophic damage to our men and women in uniform and our national security.''
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has said the cuts would result in ''the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915 and the smallest Air Force in its history.'' He also raised the specter of deep cuts to America's nuclear arsenal.
Independent analysts of the military budget said that the situation was not as dire as Mr. Panetta described, but that the cuts, which by law cannot be ''backloaded'' to leave the biggest reductions for later years, would put a large strain on the Pentagon.
Mr. Obama's potential Republican rivals wasted no time framing the failure of the committee, whose talks he was almost completely absent from, as the president's failure. At a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Monday, Mitt Romney said the most disappointing aspect of the panel's failure was ''that our president has had no involvement with the process.'' In a speech Monday, Newt Gingrich, another Republican candidate for president, called the failure of the committee ''good for America.''
It was a view Mr. Obama vigorously disputed. The president noted pointedly after the talks failed that he had sent Congress his proposal to trim the deficit. ''It's a plan that would reduce the deficit by an additional $3 trillion, by cutting spending, slowing the growth of Medicare and Medicaid and asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share.''
Republicans, he said, ''simply will not budge'' from their refusal to consider tax increases on the wealthy. ''That refusal continues to be the main stumbling block that has prevented Congress from reaching an agreement to reduce our deficit.''
Obama administration officials say they believe that a majority of Americans support the president's proposals. A senior official on Monday night told reporters that the administration believed that ''at some point,'' public pressure would persuade Republican lawmakers to strike a deal.
Beyond that, Mr. Obama's advisers say privately that they believe Republicans have more to lose than Democrats if there is no deficit reduction deal in the near term. ''No one, I repeat, no one wants the trigger to go into effect,'' an administration official said Monday on the condition of anonymity. ''But let's face it -- those guys really don't want it going into effect.''
Asked whether the official believed that the desire to protect the Pentagon from big cuts would force the Republicans to compromise next year, the official replied, ''We'll see.''
At a final meeting Monday, seven of the 12 committee members discussed a new proposal from Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. Republicans left early, their faces grim, their moods dark.
Mr. Kerry, walking later through the Russell Senate Office Building surrounded by reporters, said his last-ditch plan would have created a procedure for ''expedited tax reform'' next year, allowing the committee to defer decisions about the fate of the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003.
A Republican close to the negotiations saw it differently. ''Kerry went rogue,'' he said, ''and tried to float another iteration of a trillion-dollar tax hike.''

HEADLINE: The Supercommittee Collapses

 BODY:
The smoke from the smoldering failure known as the deficit ''supercommittee'' spread heavily across Capitol Hill on Monday, allowing Republicans to obscure the simple truth about the failure to reach an agreement. The only reason the committee failed was because Republicans refused to raise taxes on the rich, and, in fact, wanted to cut them even below their current bargain-basement level.
Republicans in Washington claimed Democrats refused to budge on entitlements. John Boehner, the House speaker, and Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, as if by rote, issued statements saying it was all President Obama's fault. But, had a single Republican on the panel endorsed even a modest increase in upper-income tax rates, Republicans could have won trillions in cuts from entitlements and discretionary spending. (Certainly far beyond anything we would endorse.) 
None would take that courageous step, and now it seems foolish to have expected that they would. In July, they rejected a ''grand bargain'' from President Obama that would have cut $1 trillion in domestic and defense spending, and $650 billion from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, all because it would have raised tax revenues by $1.2 trillion. They dismissed Mr. Obama's second offer in September, which would have cut $3.6 trillion from the deficit, 60 percent from spending cuts.
And, naturally, they rejected the proposal from supercommittee Democrats to cut at least $3 trillion from the deficit, because a third of it would have come from higher taxes on the rich. When you hear Republicans claim that Democrats refused to touch their sacred cows of spending, remember that the Democratic offer would have cut $475 billion from Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years, nearly half of which would have come directly from beneficiaries. That's more than the Bowles-Simpson deficit plan proposed, and eight times the level of Medicare cuts offered by President Obama in September.
These plans actually tipped too far in the direction of spending cuts. By comparison, the Republican offers were risible. One pretended to raise revenue by $300 billion, while actually calling for the Bush tax cuts to be permanent and even reducing the top bracket to 28 percent from 35 percent. The consequences of this failure are serious.
FORCED SPENDING CUTS The most immediate result will be an automatic cut in federal spending of $1.2 trillion, which will disproportionately affect defense programs. That cut, though, doesn't take effect until 2013, which means that Congress will spend the next year trying to reconfigure it or come up with a real deficit plan.
Expect to hear a huge wailing from the good friends of military contractors in Congress, mostly Republicans, who will try to use every budgetary choke point to undo the defense sequester, possibly starting as soon as next month, when the current continuing resolution financing the government runs out.
Cutting one-tenth of the military budget is hardly a real threat to national security, and it is fitting that the sequester hits defense particularly hard because the first $900 billion in cuts in the law creating the supercommittee came out of nondefense domestic spending. An across-the-board cut of $55 billion a year is a terrible way to achieve cuts in the Pentagon's budget. But the president and Democrats in Congress should hold firm to their pledge not to undo this sequester until Republicans give in on their pledge never to raise taxes on the rich.
Any lawmaker who fears devastating cuts to the armed forces should explain why they consider it more important to keep upper-bracket taxes historically low.
THE RISK TO RECOVERY The supercommittee drew the focus away from the more important task of creating jobs. But that need is coming right up with the renewal of the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance, both of which expire at the end of the year. Without them, the economy could lose up to 2 percentage points of its potential growth in 2012. A deal by the panel probably could have included both measures, but now Republicans are talking about trying to extort a deal, possibly involving the Bush tax cuts, which expire at the end of 2012.
The formation of the deficit panel was an acknowledgment that the regular budget process had also failed, largely because of the 60-vote rule in the Senate, which Republicans have made routine. With the panel's collapse, the process now returns to the usual open-air infighting, which is an alarming thought, but at least will make it clear which side is refusing to cut the payroll tax and extend jobless benefits.
It will also illuminate the Republican fixation on preserving the Bush tax cuts. By refusing the Democrats' proposals on the panel, Republicans clearly figured that they might win the next election and keep the cuts. But even if they win the White House, getting to the necessary 60 votes in the Senate would still be a long shot.
Until then, Democrats should press their advantage. No matter what happens next November, by the time of the next postelection lame-duck session, Republicans may be so fearful of the military sequester and the expiring cuts that they might agree to a deal that preserves the cuts for the middle class while ending them for the rich.
Americans should know that that was a deal that could have been reached last summer.

HEADLINE: Republicans and Obama Can Agree on Criticizing China's Trade Practices

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- China's swift economic rise, and a presidential election dominated by fears of a declining American economy, have produced a rare convergence: Republican contenders talking tough about China, and a president who is already getting tough on it.
As President Obama returned Sunday from a trip to Asia that was filled with signs that the United States plans to be a counterweight to Beijing's growing influence in that region, Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates have stepped up their denunciation of China's trade practices, casting the country as predatory and a culprit for lost jobs at home.
Given the bleak economic backdrop, China's emergence as an election issue is no big surprise. But it is an unusual case in which domestic politics are playing to Mr. Obama's diplomatic advantage, allowing him to project to China the picture of a country united in its resolve.
Still, the intensity of the American anti-China sentiment-- in Congress, as well as on the campaign trail and during Mr. Obama's travels -- could have damaging consequences for the relationship between the two countries, regardless of who wins the White House. 
Mr. Romney, diplomats and other experts said, could be haunted by his harsh claims that China steals American technology and hacks into its computers, and his threat to declare it a currency manipulator on his first day in the Oval Office. As candidates, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton both attacked China, only to have to make amends after bitterness in Beijing hindered their efforts to work with Chinese leaders.
Mr. Obama avoided going after China when he ran in 2008, and he has sought to balance criticism of Beijing's economic policies with pledges of global partnership. But experts and former officials said the president would be pressured, by the Republicans and by his own political advisers, to take a harder line this time around.
''He has not risen to the bait to try to outbid Romney rhetorically in terms of the security relationship,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, who was Mr. Obama's chief adviser on China until last April. But, he added, ''If you look at what he has said on economic issues, it's hard-edged.''
At an economic summit meeting in Hawaii last week, Mr. Obama said that China was now a ''grown-up'' economy, and that its leaders needed to start behaving that way. He singled out Beijing's artificially depressed currency, which undercuts exports from the United States. The American people, he declared, ''understandably, feel that enough is enough.''
On Saturday, on the Indonesian island of Bali, Mr. Obama threw his weight behind neighbors of China who are disputing Beijing's aggressive maritime claims in the South China Sea.
Chinese leaders were rattled by the flurry of American initiatives during the president's trip, which also included reaffirming an alliance with the Philippines, opening a historic diplomatic channel to Myanmar and agreeing to deploy 2,500 Marines to Australia.
The American election adds to their confusion, China experts said, because they are uncertain how much of Mr. Obama's stance is driven by domestic political calculations.
But the president's criticism has been far more measured than that of Mr. Romney and other Republicans, who excoriated China at a debate in South Carolina that occurred as Mr. Obama was greeting the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, in Hawaii.
''We can't just sit back and let China run all over us,'' Mr. Romney said, calling for tariffs on Chinese goods. ''People say, well, you'll start a trade war. There's one going on right now, folks.''
For Mr. Romney, a wealthy business executive with free-market credentials, criticizing China is a rare chance to play the populist and appeal to working-class voters, many of whom do blame China and other Asian nations for sucking away jobs with cheaper labor and production costs.
Not wanting to be outdone, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas likened China to the Soviet Union. ''I happen to think that the Communist Chinese government will end up on the ash heap of history,'' he said.
While Chinese officials are sophisticated enough to understand the posturing in Republican primaries, Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China adviser to President Bill Clinton, said that on a recent visit to Beijing, several of them expressed worry to him about the tone of the campaign. China is in its own delicate leadership transition and has a restive military eager to flex its muscles.
''This kind of rhetoric really helps the nationalist and conservative wings of the Chinese government,'' said Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''To reinforce the hard-liners could lead not only to economic tensions, but a military confrontation.''
In Washington, the maneuvering over China also has a military component. The Pentagon is using an expanded American presence in Asia to help forestall deep cuts in the defense budget. Facing off against the People's Liberation Army, officials argue, will require a reinforced Navy and other military hardware.
Then, too, there is the political benefit of targeting a country whose success is alarming to many Americans, especially at a time of near double-digit unemployment. In a CBS News poll last month, 61 percent of people said the economic expansion of China was ''generally bad'' for the United States. Only 15 percent said it was ''generally good.''
The Senate has responded to such fears by passing a bill that would impose tariffs on Chinese goods to punish it for keeping its currency artificially low. Last week, the House Intelligence Committee announced it would investigate a Chinese telecommunications company to determine if it posed a national security threat to the United States.
''It will cost President Obama votes if he comes up short on China as a currency manipulator, or in enforcing trade laws,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored the currency bill. ''You can't talk about jobs and the economy without talking about China.''
Senator Brown credited Mr. Obama with imposing tariffs on Chinese tires, citing unfair trade practices. And he predicted voters in Ohio, whatever their frustration with the president, would not believe Mr. Romney's tough talk, given that he is a ''guy who's come to my state, bought companies, shut them down and moved the jobs to China.''
No one better embodies the complexities of China's political role than Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the Republican candidate who was governor of Utah and ambassador to China under Mr. Obama. As a young aide to President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Huntsman said he traveled to Beijing to help repair the damage done to relations by Mr. Reagan's threat, during the 1980 campaign, to restore Taiwan's diplomatic status, in defiance of China.
''He got into office and found that the world functioned a little differently,'' Mr. Huntsman said in an interview. ''You needed to sit down with the Chinese to figure out how to manage these issues.''
Like his fellow Republicans, Mr. Huntsman said the United States needed to be more aggressive in defending its interests with China. But he added, ''It can't be a Romney approach, where you go to the W.T.O., slap a tariff on and end up in a trade war.''

HEADLINE: Opposition Meeting With British Highlights Syria's Isolation

BYLINE: By SEBNEM ARSU; Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Syria's political opposition widened its outreach on Monday, sending representatives to Britain as the Syrian government withstood signs of further isolation over an uprising that is increasingly resembling a prolonged armed struggle to oust President Bashar al-Assad.
William Hague, Britain's foreign secretary, met with the opposition representatives, the Foreign Office said on its Web site. Mr. Hague did not specify what type of assistance, if any, was discussed, but he said in a statement that ''we want to continue to step up the international pressure on the Assad regime, a regime that has long since lost its legitimacy in the eyes of the wider world.'' 
The Arab League has suspended Syria, and a growing number of countries, led by the United States and members of the European Union, have penalized Mr. Assad with economic sanctions. Turkey, which Mr. Assad had once counted as a friend, has also castigated him, given sanctuary to an insurgent group and threatened further action. Turkey's president, Abdullah Gul, who was about to begin a three-day visit to Britain, said in an interview with the BBC on Monday that Mr. Assad was not serious about meeting the legitimate demands of his political opponents, ''so therefore we don't have any more trust.''
The developments came as anti-Assad activist groups reported 12 new deaths on Monday in the Syria uprising, which has claimed more than 3,500 lives by the United Nations' count since it began in March.
Reuters said the latest civilian deaths included two youths killed by Syrian security forces in the central city of Homs, a center of the movement, as the forces were looking for a Syrian soccer celebrity, Abdelbasset Saroud, who has been leading protest rallies against Mr. Assad.
The Syrian government heavily restricts foreign press access, and there was no way to corroborate the reports.
The violence in Syria also claimed its first Turkish civilian casualties, as a bus convoy transporting Turkish Muslims home from Saudi Arabia was shot at by unidentified assailants as it traversed Syrian territory. Turkish news reports said at least two Turks were wounded.
The Foreign Ministry of Turkey, which had issued an advisory to its citizens on Sunday urging them to avoid travel to Syria, confirmed there was an attack and said it was making inquiries but did not report any details.
''We were driving in a convoy of eight to nine buses, before a red car with four people came on our way, and started firing on us,'' Cemil Karli, an injured pilgrim, was quoted as telling Turkey's Anatolian News Agency. ''As they realized that we were going to continue our way, four more people appeared in distance and fired on us.''
Mr. Karli, who was shot in his abdomen and left leg, and Naci Ozata, the driver, were treated at the public hospital in Hatay, a Turkish border town.
The driver of one of the buses had missed the turn for the border gate while crossing through Homs in central Syria and had asked for directions before armed men in uniforms opened fire, said NTV, a private Turkish television news channel.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey would not comment on the bus shooting, but he reiterated his call on Mr. Assad to end violence against peaceful protesters.
''If you believe and trust yourself as a leader, you would open up the ballot boxes and your people walk to them, and if they name you as the government, you would then govern that country,'' Mr. Erdogan said in Istanbul. ''However, governments can last only until one point with tanks and shells. One day you would also leave, because those seats are not eternal but temporary.''
In Washington, the State Department announced that Robert S. Ford, the ambassador to Syria who was abruptly withdrawn from the country last month, would not go back there by Thanksgiving, as had been previously planned. A State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, told reporters at a news briefing that the United States would ''be consulting with our allies and partners on the appropriate timing for his return.''
Mr. Ford, an outspoken critic of Mr. Assad's crackdown on dissent, left Syria because of what American officials called threats to his safety.

HEADLINE: A Gingrich Alternative To Social Security

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Contending that Social Security provides ''a dismal return'' to retirees on a lifetime of ''burdensome tax payments,'' Newt Gingrich proposed giving younger workers the option of a private savings account. 
Mr. Gingrich, who is leading the Republican presidential field in some recent polls, revived an idea long popular in conservative policy circles, and he made the case that privatization would both rescue Social Security and provide more comfortable retirements thanks to the returns of stocks and bonds.
''This gives Americans ownership over their retirement and the opportunity to unleash the power of the market to enjoy prosperous retirements beyond their most optimistic expectations, while also wiping out all future liabilities in the Social Security system,'' Mr. Gingrich argued in a policy paper he presented Monday in New Hampshire.
The high cost of entitlements is a major target of all the Republican hopefuls. Earlier, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme, proposed letting younger workers open personal savings accounts. Mitt Romney has advocated raising the retirement age for future workers and slowing increases in benefits to richer retirees.
Rather than raising the age to receive benefits, Mr. Gingrich argues that Social Security's fiscal challenges can be entirely met by personal accounts. They will pay higher benefits than the current system, he says, thanks to the appreciation of stocks, bonds and the like.
But won't benefits be subject to the ups and downs of markets? Would a worker want to give up a defined-benefit program like Social Security after seeing stocks lose nearly 40 percent of their value after the financial crisis? Mr. Gingrich argues in his 48-page position paper that a long-term investor would still come out ahead.
But Paul N. Van de Water, an economist with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that if younger workers withdrew from Social Security, there would be a huge gap in payments for current retirees. Such concerns helped kill President George W. Bush's proposal for individual retirement accounts in 2005.
''It's basically impossible to design a private-account plan that doesn't either require huge federal borrowing for a long time to make up the shortfall to the existing Social Security program or have very sharp cuts in benefits, or a bit of both,'' Mr. Van de Water said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Greenberg Sues U.S. Over A.I.G. Takeover

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, sued the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Monday, contending that their takeover of the insurer in the fall of 2008 was improper and that the Fed breached its duty to A.I.G. shareholders when it unwound the company's disastrous bets on mortgage securities.
The two lawsuits were filed on behalf of Starr International, Mr. Greenberg's company and a large A.I.G. shareholder. The suit against the Treasury was filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington. The case against the New York Fed, a private corporation, was brought in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
''What these lawsuits say is that in our country, not even the government is above the law,'' said David Boies, the lawyer at Boies, Schiller & Flexner, who represents Mr. Greenberg and Starr. ''When the government takes action, although it has enormous power, there are legal limits to what they can do. One of those limits is that they cannot take private property even for a good purpose if they do it in violation of legal protection or don't give just compensation.''
The lawsuit against the Treasury contends that the takeover of A.I.G. discriminated against the company and its shareholders by charging onerous interest rates on loans extended by the government -- 14.5 percent initially -- and by taking an 80 percent interest in the company over the objections of shareholders.
The terms of the government's assistance to Citigroup, which was aided about the same time, provide a contrast, the lawsuit contends. Indicating the punitive nature of the A.I.G. rescue, the suit pointed out that Citigroup received loans at a fraction of the interest rate charged to A.I.G. and that the government took on only a modest stake in the bank.
''The government is not empowered to trample shareholder and property rights even in the midst of a financial emergency,'' the lawsuit said.
At the time of the A.I.G. bailout, Henry M. Paulson Jr. was head of the Treasury and Timothy F. Geithner was president of the New York Fed. Mr. Geithner is now Treasury secretary.
A spokeswoman for the Treasury provided a statement from Tim Massad, assistant secretary for financial stability. ''It is important to remember that the government provided assistance to A.I.G. -- and stopped it from collapsing -- in order to prevent a meltdown of the entire global financial system,'' he said. ''Our actions were necessary, legal and constitutional. We are reviewing the lawsuit and expect to defend our actions vigorously.''
Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, called the suit meritless and said that A.I.G.'s alternative to the government bailout was bankruptcy and a worthless stock. ''The Federal Reserve's actions with regard to A.I.G. helped to restore financial stability in the United States during a period of intense volatility and vulnerability in the U.S. economy,'' Mr. Gutt said.
Together, the Starr lawsuits seek at least $25 billion in damages, which is the value of A.I.G. shares held by Starr before the government bailed out the insurer. But as they progress, Starr International's lawyers will request information about the decisions to rescue A.I.G., including documents and e-mail traffic between the Treasury, the New York Fed, A.I.G. and its trading partners.
The court actions may fill in some of the details surrounding the takeover that remain shrouded in secrecy, especially the decision by the Fed to unwind the credit insurance the company had written on souring mortgage securities and pay A.I.G.'s trading partners in full. Mr. Greenberg declined to comment.
A.I.G.'s credit insurance positions were closed out in November 2008. It later emerged that New York Fed officials chose to pay the insurer's trading partners 100 cents on the dollar, even though some institutions were willing to accept a discount. The New York Fed also tried to keep A.I.G. from identifying the institutions that received the payouts, even though the insurer argued that such disclosures were called for under securities laws.
Critics have called the Fed's decision a backdoor bailout for prosperous institutions that had dealings with A.I.G. Only later were these institutions identified; they included Goldman Sachs, the French bank Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank.
The lawsuit against the New York Fed also says that the Fed breached its duty to A.I.G. shareholders by requiring that the company release these trading partners from any possible legal actions related to the mortgage securities it had agreed to insure.
A report on the A.I.G. takeover published last month by the Government Accountability Office found inconsistencies and contradictions in New York Fed officials' explanations for why it paid A.I.G.'s trading partners in full. The report also noted that the New York Fed's decision to make these institutions whole on the credit insurance written by A.I.G. disregarded the expectations of Fed officials in Washington.

HEADLINE: Romney Heats Up Campaign in New Hampshire With an Ad Attacking Obama

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
NASHUA, N.H. -- Moving the campaign into a more combative phase, Mitt Romney is set to show his first television commercial of the campaign on Tuesday in New Hampshire, attacking President Obama over his economic leadership on the same day the president will visit the state to discuss his plans for turning around the economy.
Though Mr. Romney's advertisement is aimed squarely at the president, it also represents a step up in the intensity of the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Just six weeks before the first votes are cast, no candidate has been able to decisively claim the mantle of front-runner. 
On Monday, a CNN/ORC International poll found that Mr. Romney was still struggling to earn the trust of many Republicans. According to the national survey, 24 percent of Republicans and independents who lean toward the party said they were most likely to support Newt Gingrich for the nomination, and 20 percent said Mr. Romney, a difference that falls within the survey's sampling error.
Given the fluid nature of the race, Mr. Romney's $134,000 ad buy on WMUR-TV is expected to prompt further spending on advertising -- by his campaign, his Republican rivals and outside groups. Some commercials for candidates and their super PACs have already gone on the air, but the decision by Mr. Romney to hold back had essentially frozen the ad war.
By focusing his message on the president, Mr. Romney is trying to show Republicans that he can take on Mr. Obama aggressively, an attribute that conservatives are seeking in a nominee.
But there is also a risk in getting ahead of himself, especially with polls showing that he is having a difficult time reaching beyond a base of about 25 percent.
In New Hampshire, a critical state for him, Mr. Romney has a solid lead in the polls. But even here, he has been forced to look over his shoulder.
In recent days, Mr. Gingrich has received a surge of attention from voters and the news media. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. opened a major ad campaign in the state, paid for by a super PAC, Our Destiny, that is underwritten by his billionaire father, Jon M. Huntsman Sr. The blitz was estimated to cost $750,000 -- far more than Mr. Romney's initial buy.
''We understand New Hampshire voters want the chance to meet candidates several times and make a decision in the final days before the election,'' said Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman. ''So we're campaigning every day like we're three votes behind, holding town halls and doing all the small things needed to win the primary.''
The Romney commercial also represents something of a stealth attack, running through the week of Thanksgiving, a time normally considered a slow period for politicking. (The Romney team has said it expects to keep a low profile this week but return to the trail at an accelerated, full-force pace after the weekend.)
In an interview broadcast Monday night with Sean Hannity of Fox News, Mr. Romney offered a preview of his ad.
''Well, I want people to remember that when he was Candidate Obama, that he said he was going to get this economy going, he was going to bring people together, be a real leader for change in America,'' Mr. Romney said in the interview, which was taped Sunday. ''And so I'm going to run an ad that shows him and the things he said here in New Hampshire in a speech here. The contrast between what he said and what he did is so stark, people will recognize we really do need to have someone new lead this country. And then I, of course, described why I'm the right person for that responsibility.''
Mr. Romney's plan to greet Mr. Obama in New Hampshire with the commercial sets up a tug of war between the two men for independents, who are allowed to vote in the state's primary.
At a campaign stop on Monday in Nashua, Mr. Romney also offered a glimpse at the attack he will level at Mr. Obama, whom he called ''a failure.''
''When he was here four years ago, he spoke about bringing in a new era to the nation and getting our economy going,'' Mr. Romney said. ''He spoke on the 'Today' show shortly after being inaugurated and said if he isn't able to turn around the economy in three years, he'd be looking at a one-term proposition. I'm here to collect on that.''
Mr. Romney added that Mr. Obama had failed to deliver the economic recovery he promised while campaigning in the state four years ago.
''He's going to be back in New Hampshire tomorrow; I'd like to hear what he has to say,'' Mr. Romney said. ''My guess is he won't be reminding people of what he said four years ago. He'll be trying to talk about something else, because it's very clear we're not better off than we were when he came into office.''
Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, praised the president's record and sought to turn the focus back on Mr. Romney.
''President Obama promised to end the war in Iraq, to target the Al Qaeda network, to deliver affordable, accessible health care to millions of Americans, to expand educational opportunity and to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and he brought the nation back from the brink of recession to spur 20 straight months of private sector job growth,'' Mr. LaBolt said in an e-mail. ''Mitt Romney will say and stand for anything to get elected -- he was pro-choice until he was pro-life, pro-immigration reform until he was against it and he took action against climate change until he started pretending there was nothing we could do about it.''

HEADLINE: The Two Moons

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1951, Samuel Lubell invented the concept of the political solar system. At any moment, he wrote, there is a Sun Party (the majority party, which drives the agenda) and a Moon Party (the minority party, which shines by reflecting the solar rays).
During Franklin Roosevelt's era, Democrats were the Sun Party. During Ronald Reagan's, Republicans were. Then, between 1996 and 2004, the two parties were tied. We lived in a 50-50 nation in which the overall party vote totals barely budged five elections in a row. It seemed then that we were in a moment of transition, waiting for the next Sun Party to emerge. 
But something strange happened. No party took the lead. According to data today, both parties have become minority parties simultaneously. We are living in the era of two moons and no sun.
It used to be that the parties were on a seesaw: If the ratings of one dropped, then the ratings of the other rose. But now the two parties have record-low approval ratings together. Neither party has been able to rally the country behind its vision of government.
Ronald Brownstein summarized the underlying typography recently in The National Journal: ''In Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor polls over the past two years, up to 40 percent of Americans have consistently expressed support for the conservative view that government is more the problem than the solution for the nation's challenges; about another 30 percent have backed the Democratic view that government must take an active role in the economy; and the remaining 30 percent are agnostic. They are open to government activism in theory but skeptical it will help them in practice.''
In these circumstances, both parties have developed minority mentalities. The Republicans feel oppressed by the cultural establishment, and Democrats feel oppressed by the corporate establishment. They embrace the mental habits that have always been adopted by those who feel themselves resisting the onslaught of a dominant culture.
Their main fear is that they will lose their identity and cohesion if their members compromise with the larger world. They erect clear and rigid boundaries separating themselves from their enemies. In a hostile world, they erect rules and pledges and become hypervigilant about deviationism. They are more interested in protecting their special interests than converting outsiders. They slowly encase themselves in an epistemic cocoon.
The Democrat and Republican parties used to contain serious internal debates -- between moderate and conservative Republicans, between New Democrats and liberals. Neither party does now.
The Democratic and Republican parties used to promote skilled coalition builders. Now the American parties have come to resemble the ideologically coherent European ones.
The Democrats talk and look like a conventional liberal party (some liberals, who represent, at most, 30 percent of the country, are disappointed because President Obama hasn't ushered in a Huffington Post paradise). Meanwhile, many Republicans flock to Herman Cain or Newt Gingrich because they are more interested in having a leader who can take on the mainstream news media than in having one who can plausibly govern. Grover Norquist's tax pledge isn't really about public policy; it's a chastity belt Republican politicians wear to show that they haven't been defiled by the Washington culture.
The era of the two moons is a volatile era. Independent voters are trapped in a cycle of sour rejectionism -- voting against whichever of the two options they dislike most at the moment. The shift between the 2008 election, when voters rejected Republicans, and the 2010 election, when voters rejected Democrats, was as big as any shift in recent history.
Sometimes voters even reject both parties on the same day. In Ohio last month, for example, voters rejected the main fiscal policy of the Republican governor. On the same ballot, by 31 points, they rejected health care reform, the main initiative of their Democratic president.
In policy terms, the era of the two moons is an era of stagnation. Each party is too weak to push its own agenda and too encased by its own cocoon to agree to a hybrid. The supercommittee failed for this reason. Members of the supercommittee actually took some brave steps outside party orthodoxy (Republicans embraced progressive tax increases, Democrats flirted with spending cuts), but these were baby steps, insufficient to change the alignment.
In normal circumstances, minority parties suffer a series of electoral defeats and then they modernize. But in the era of the two moons, the parties enjoy periodic election victories they don't deserve, which only re-enforce their worst habits.
So it's hard to see how we get out of this, unless some third force emerges, which wedges itself into one of the two parties, or unless we have a devastating fiscal crisis -- a brutal cleansing flood, after which the sun will shine again.

HEADLINE: It's the Golden Age of Flying. (Just Don't Forget the Gold.)

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS I've been saying for some time, the golden age of air travel wasn't back in those Pan Am glory days celebrated on television. Actually, the golden age is now -- but only if you're traveling in the front of the plane on an international flight.
As noted on the front page of The New York Times on Monday, in-flight luxury is very, very comfortable for those who can afford it, and very profitable for the airlines that sell it. 
How much does this high life cost? Well, as an example, assume you have a sudden impulse to fly first class on British Airways from New York to London on Tuesday, returning on Saturday. The top fare for a round-trip first-class ticket is $18,513.70.
Of course, this includes a flat-bed seat, all the Champagne you want, and a meal served ''on an exquisitely dressed table with crisp white linen and fine bone china,'' as the British Airways Web site says. And, naturally, first-class passengers on all airlines don't have to stand in line to board the plane, while hoi polloi dutifully wait back in the dim recesses of the boarding area.
Let's compare that to my most recent airplane trip, which I booked on the Continental Web site: a one-way flight from La Guardia Airport in New York to Tucson, with a connection in Denver. The coach fare was $314.40.
I no longer have elite status at any level on any airline. Schedule and price were the sole reasons I booked on Continental, now known as United Continental since the recent merger.
Lacking status, I was unable to choose a seat assignment at booking. At check-in, my seat assignment was 36C, an aisle seat in the next-to-last row for the first long leg of the flight, on an A320 operated by United with 138 seats -- 90 in basic economy, where the seats had a paltry 31 inches of legroom.
Boarding with a coach ticket, bereft of status, is an exercise in knowing one's humble place these days. You wait there, listening to the gate agent summoning the ranks into formation, starting with first class, working through the elite-status levels, then to the travelers holding various airline-branded credit cards. Medieval theologians who devised the ranks of heavenly hosts in the Celestial Hierarchy -- seraphim and cherubim first, common angels last -- used a simpler formula.
When I finally made it to the jetway at the tail end of the line, an airline employee blocked my way. ''You need to gate-check that,'' she said, grabbing my small backpack and slapping a tag on it.
More surprises awaited after takeoff. In the seat next to me was a man with a very large child on his lap. The child kept hitting me, which is a lot to put up with in cramped conditions on a four-hour flight. There were two lavatories in the back of the plane, one of which the flight attendants declared was ''broken.''
Passengers wanting to use the single bathroom were not allowed to wait in the space by the galley where the flight attendants lurked. This meant I had an unruly child pawing me with his sticky hands on one side and anxious passengers lined up for the bathroom, bumping me from the aisle.
Afterward, retrieving my backpack, from which an important file had gone missing, I thought, O.K. airlines, I surrender. Most domestic airlines now operate with a meticulously calibrated system aimed at imposing a charge for each degree of misery you choose to eliminate.
There are many ways to purchase less awful treatment. Obviously, the best is buying a higher fare ticket and opting for the few miserable inches of extra legroom you get in premium economy sections. Achieving elite status is another, of course. Some airlines let you pay extra money at booking to get perks like priority boarding or choosing a seat location.
But increasingly, airlines are depending on the money they raise in their partnerships with the banks that issue credit cards under an airline's own brand. Rather than just providing frequent-flier miles to customers who pay annual fees, these cards offer a wider variety of benefits, including priority boarding, free checked bags and a measure of status.
The proceeds from these credit cards fall under the general category of ancillary fee revenue, which these days make the difference between profit and loss on most domestic carriers. This year, seven major domestic airlines will generate $12.5 billion in ancillary revenue, nearly double the $6.7 billion raised in 2010, according to a forecast by Amadeus, the global reservations company, and IdeaWorks, the airline marketing consulting firm. (The figure excludes Southwest Airlines, which is far less dependent on this kind of revenue than its major competitors.)
Bag fees, which get most of the media attention, make up only about 20 percent of this revenue pie. Revenue from the branded credit cards, including the sale of frequent-flier miles, makes up half of the pie, said Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorks.
''There are two ways they extract money from you,'' Mr. Sorensen said of the fee structure. ''One is while you're booking, you select an a la carte option and pay for it then. The other one is for you to pick up the benefit as part of a credit card.''
He added, ''I think airlines are happier with the credit card part, because with the annual fee, it's almost like you're buying stock in the airline. You've made a cash investment in the relationship.''
Well, let me think about that investment for a bit. Just how much is it worth to avoid the child with the sticky palms?

HEADLINE: Economic Insecurity

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A new report says that 45 percent of United States residents live without economic security. 

 BODY:
With the Census Bureau fine-tuning its definition of poverty, a group of "near poor" has emerged - those who are not officially poor but are perilously close to it.
 Another way of putting that is to look at "economic security," the amount of income necessary to cover basic expenses without relying on public subsidies.
A new report from Wider Opportunities for Women, a nonprofit group that previously produced an index of what it takes to do more than survive while working, shows that 45 percent of United States residents live without economic security. That means they are not earning enough income to cover basic expenses, plan for important life events like college or save for emergencies like unexpected health bills.
 "What does it take for households in this country to get by and be able to plan for their own futures based on the work that they do?" said Donna Addkison, president and chief executive of Wider Opportunities for Women. "We're really looking at not just the lowest of the lowest income households but that slice of households that live somewhere above the poverty line but are constantly in danger of being thrown into financial catastrophe, and that's a much larger slice of the American public than we are currently talking about."
 Although the study uses median incomes on a national basis, Wider Opportunities and its research partners are working on tables that define what economic security would mean on a state-by-state basis. Obviously, the income needed to cover basic expenses would be higher in New York City than in Omaha.
 The report showed that 55 percent of children live in households where families do not earn enough to achieve economic security. Even among those households with two full-time workers, 22 percent of those families with children earn less than is necessary to guarantee economic security.
 The most vulnerable households are those led by single mothers, as well as African-American and Hispanic households. Only 18 percent of households headed by single mothers are living with economic security, while two-thirds of Hispanic households and 62 percent of African-American households are not earning enough to cover basic needs and saving requirements.
 Part of the problem, Ms. Addkison said, is that so many jobs pay low wages. According to the report, less than 13 percent of the jobs that the Labor Department projects will be created by 2018 will pay wages that will be sufficient to allow families to keep their heads above water.
 "We have a construct in this country that if you work full time and keep your nose clean and live by the rules, you will get that full-time job that allows you to take care of your family," Ms. Addkison said. "And what we're finding is that workers who are working full time or the equivalent are still struggling."

HEADLINE: Tokyo and Osaka Exchanges Reach $1.1 Billion Merger Deal

BYLINE: HIROKO TABUCHI


HIGHLIGHT: The $1.1 billion agreement will create the third-largest exchange in the world and perhaps give the Japanese listings a lift. 

 BODY:
TOKYO - The Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan's largest, on Tuesday announced a $1.1 billion merger deal with the Osaka Securities Exchange that would create the world's third-largest exchange, as measured by the value of listed stock
The deal, which would unify the two exchanges by January 2013, is a bid to keep up with stiff competition among global market operators and to put Japanese equities back on the world map.
With listed stocks worth about $3.6 trillion, the new exchange would trail only NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, both based in New York, according to Reuters.
The merger deal, which comes after months of difficult negotiations, aims to reverse a decline in Tokyo's standing as a global financial center. The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in its heyday in the late 1980s was by far the world's largest, has since seen trading slump in tandem with the Japanese economy.
The Topix index is down 75 percent since the peak of Japan's asset bubble, in December 1989. Japan fell behind China as the world's second-largest equity market in 2008.
With a home market still dogged with economic stagnation, the outlook for Japanese equities has become increasingly dismal. Trading volumes have tumbled by half since a rally in 2006 and 2007, and hit a new low for the year in October.
Competition for investment dollars, meanwhile, has heightened as the world's stock exchanges have joined forces to bolster their offerings and save on costs. A proposed merger of Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext, if approved by the European Union, would create the world's largest exchange operator.
The Tokyo and Osaka exchanges have struggled to persuade overseas companies to list in Japan. Of the roughly 2,300 companies listed on all sections of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, only 12 are non-Japanese. No new foreign companies listed in 2010.
A $140 million high-speed trading system introduced by the Tokyo Stock Exchange last year, intended to attract hedge funds and other high-frequency traders to Japan, has done little to lift trading volumes.
"For a Japanese stock exchange to survive such global competition as a player," the Tokyo and Osaka exchanges said in a joint statement, "it must establish a highly liquid and efficient market and enhance the convenience of investors and companies" through economies of scale, more services and lower costs.
The two exchanges appear to be a good match: Tokyo dominates the cash equity market in Japan, while Osaka specializes in derivatives trading. By combining trading systems, the new exchange expects to save 7 billion yen ($91 million) a year in operating costs.
Atsushi Saito, chief executive of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will head the new exchange, tentatively named the Japan Exchange Group, the statement said. Michio Yoneda, the head of the Osaka Securities Exchange, will become chief operating officer.

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. Meet Judy Helgager. 

 BODY:
I was born into a WASP family in Wisconsin during WWII. Working class family on one side and a mixture of laborers and career educators on the other. Religious but not always practicing the principles. Politics were based on emotion more than reason and logic. Mother strong Republican, Father a Democrat. One younger sister. We were an extended family before we began using the term. Closest relative about 60 miles away. Lived in the same community until I was 20. Girl Scouts, lots of music...3 instruments, singing, paper dolls, movies, Elvis, you get it. Did lots of babysitting and a variety of other things to earn my own money. Did not drive a car until I was in my 20s. My mother did not drive until much later in her life. I see smiling faces of myself in old photos but recall that school (took Latin) was not easy and I was a bullied child. Home life not always easy. Parents seemed depressed. Sister pregnant at 15 or 16 and married a guy in my age group. They later divorced after he abused her.
I am well educated...graduated from high school, then spent two years in a Catholic Women's college in my hometown. Kind of a bold move cause Catholics and Lutherans often at odds. Took organ lessons from a nun and played the organ in a Lutheran Church. Used music to earn spending money. Then I went off to school in South Dakota: Augustana College (where I met my husband), from which I graduated with a degree in Sociology with emphasis on English and Home Economics. I planned to become a social worker so this was not a good plan. Wish I had gone to Smith College or the University of Wisconsin/Milwaukee. Hindsight. Later I learned that I needed more education, so in the 70s I earned an Masters in Social Work at West Virginia University where we were living at the time. Good move. Gave me many more opportunities. I think I always struggled to get an education but kept on going. Earning my grad degree was much easier because I had matured. Interesting that I attended a Catholic, Lutheran and state university and came out not obsessing over religion. I am now an atheist and feel good about getting to this point. I am so much about reason, logic and free thought.
While I think that a career in social work was not the best choice for me, it shaped my life in a very meaningful way. And we did not have as many choices until Betty F came along and explained things to me...seemed a bit late at that point. The plan had been set into motion. My first job was with the IL Dept. of Children and Family Services so I learned a lot about life and really matured at that time. Did an assist to remove children from their home. Will never erase the images of that experience. Worked in health care, senior services, school social work, teaching Iranian students in the 70s (fascinating), dabbled in private practice. Was selected to be Social Worker of the Year in about 2007. I think that was well deserved because I combined hands-on work with people and political activism, a combination which I believe to be an absolute necessity in the social work field. And I did all this during the 60s and 70s when major movements were taking place and challenging the way we had done things in the past. I loved living during these decades. I also protested the Vietnam War as well as every war which has followed. Hoping for peace before I die. (an A)
It was during the politically charged times that I married Dave, a really solid guy. We moved around living in some interesting places and taking full advantage of every one of them. He was an educator and a good one! We love each other and are a pretty good match though there are times I wish I had not married. We had a son who was a really nice child and then, while working in the area of adoption, it was suggested that we adopt a child. After thinking about it, we adopted an African American girl who was 2 years old. This was in West Virginia. Wow. How about that for a life changer. We struggled with the rearing of our strong willed child but it has been worth it. She is now doing very well, bright, ambitious, obsessed with her 4 year-old daughter and married to a man she loves dearly. Our son is the custodial parent of two good children and works hard to care for them. He is a good brother to his sister and they have a good relationship. We love our young families and do whatever we can to help them thrive.
In the 80's we grabbed an opportunity to go work in Germany, leaving our home in Florida to spend three years there. Dave taught in a military school and I did social work for the United Services Organizations and the Army. Another wow!! What a risk and what an adventure. We all cherish those times and feel that we are ahead of the game re other Americans...we knew about living around terrorism long before it really reached the US. I loved the soldiers who struggled to be in their chosen work and tried to help them in whatever way I could. When we had to return to the USA I grieved for what I was leaving behind but ....
As I neared 62 I focused on retirement and was sort of burned out in my field. Intense. I eased my way out of work and entered a local film school. Another WOW! A whole new way of looking at the world. Never made a great film but sort of made a name for myself in small ways here in Sarasota, Florida. I focused on film education and criticism. And talked about film from a feminist perspective (all my days in NOW payed off). I still lead groups and work with local festivals. My trip to the Toronto Film Festival last year was soooo wonderful.
Now I am fully retired and while I keep busy, I question how productive I am. Seems like there should be more. Husband still works full time as a financial planner...we worry about our financial future...I manage the home front. Our children are self sufficient but we worry about the futures of our grandchildren. I belong to NOW, UN Women, a local humanist group, I am a friend of the Unitarian Universalist Church, sit on a local Commission on the Status of Women, volunteer in public schools, etc. I support Planned Parenthood and am a poll worker in our community. I feel a real commitment to leaving the world in good shape for our children. And I have respect for the elderly who are so incredible as they go on and on, thanks to medicine and science. I love the S word.
Finally, I think I morphed into a solid citizen and a decent person. I shed many of my old ways with ease and flexibility and while I avoided jobs with major responsibilities, etc., I did well in the areas in which I lived, worked and played. I took lots of risks and I like that about myself. I am not perfect and was not the kind of parent I wanted to be but "the kids are OK." My parents did the best they could during their time and so did we. In terms of what I say to my grandkids, I stress caring for their bodies, planning for their futures wisely and intelligently so they can be self sufficient and law abiding citizens who will fight for their rights when necessary. And I encourage them to work for peace. I have been in many rallies and street corner protests and hope they will not take their rights lightly and that I can set an example they may choose to follow.
I think that I would give myself a B because I think I have left footprints in places where I have lived. I have made a difference and hope I will continue to do so.

HEADLINE: Big Trucks Returned Big Profits for Detroit

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: Pickup trucks continue to be the largest profit centers in the product lines of many automakers, particularly American brands, according to a new report. 

 BODY:
In 2008 and 2009, as the American automotive industry foundered, critics often cited Detroit's fixation with light trucks and S.U.V.'s, which had fallen out of favor as gas prices rose, for the industry's agita. A new study authored by Max Warburton of Bernstein Research, a market trends and analysis firm, suggests that automakers' fondness for big iron was, and continues to be, driven by the outsize profit margins generated by the machines.
Detroit's light-truck models - namely the Ford F-Series, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups from General Motors and Chrysler's Ram - rank first through third among Mr. Warburton's list of the top 12 most profitable vehicles for their makers in the United States.
The list takes into account sales going back to 1990, so the influence of current economic and environmental pressures is somewhat muted. Not so muted were the pre-tax profits generated by the top three trucks since 1990: $108 billion, according to the report.
The only other Big Three product on the list is the Jeep Grand Cherokee, but the Jeep was not the most profitable S.U.V. in the rankings. That honor goes to the Lexus RX, which edged out the Grand Cherokee for No. 8 on the list. 
Mr. Warburton notes that a combination of high price, tenure in the marketplace and high volume are the keys to wide profit margins. Light trucks score high in all three of those categories, particularly volume, but they also return substantial profits because unlike passenger cars, they are not so dependent on frequent technology upgrades; suspension parts and conventional rear-drive third members often carry over from one generation to the next.
Other highly profitable vehicles on Mr. Warburton's list include two best-selling midsize Japanese sedans, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. Mr. Warburton notes that their high production volume compensates for a relatively modest price. Smaller sedans, coupes and hatches, given their even lighter price tags and lower volumes, don't return enough profit to rank among the top moneymakers.
Luxury vehicles produced in moderate volumes, meanwhile, leverage their tenure in the marketplace to ensure their makers a consistent profit stream. In particular, products from Germany, including BMW 3 and 5 Series, the Mercedes E- and S-Class, and the Porsche 911 have been boons to bottom lines. Given its high price and long marketplace tenure, the S-Class ranks as the most profitable of all passenger cars.
Mr. Warburton's complete list follows:
1. Ford F-Series
2. General Motors pickups
3. Chrysler Ram
4. Mercedes S-Class
5. BMW 5 Series
6. BMW 3 Series
7. Mercedes E-Class
8. Lexus RX
9. Jeep Grand Cherokee
10. Honda Accord
11. Porsche 911
12. Toyota Camry
