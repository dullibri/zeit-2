HEADLINE: Saving the Planet, One Book at a Time

BYLINE: By Rachel Donadio. 
Rachel Donadio is a writer and editor at the Book Review.

 BODY:
WITH its flowcharts and glossy photos of wilderness and industrial blight, the companion volume to Al Gore's environmental documentary, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' is basically a Power Point presentation on paper. Appleton Green Power Utopia 80# Matte, to be precise, a recycled paper with a sanctimonious name befitting a book that also says it's -- brace yourself -- ''carbon neutral,'' the first book ever to offset 100 percent of the carbon dioxide generated in publishing it. 
Gore's publisher, the gardening and health giant Rodale, took steps to use carbon offsets, a system by which you help finance the production of relatively clean sources of energy to make up for the less clean sources you've relied on. While ''carbon neutral'' may be a stretch, Rodale said the offsets would go toward three renewable energy projects run by NativeEnergy, ''a privately held Native American energy company,'' which estimates that 37.5 tons of carbon dioxide were generated in the production of the book's first edition, including the use of office machines and lights, printing equipment, and the trucks used to transport the book to distribution centers. The book is No. 2 on the paperback best-seller list, with 225,000 copies in print. (Paramount Classics also used carbon offsets for some of the energy used for the documentary.)
 While this is the kind of environmental consciousness we've come to expect from the former passenger of Air Force Two, Gore's is not the only effort afoot to produce greener books. In recent weeks, Random House, which estimates it buys 120,000 tons of paper a year for its 88 imprints, announced a four-year plan to increase its use of recycled paper. Some trade publishers, including Chronicle Books, and a number of leading university presses have signed on to a treatise aimed at shifting the book industry's ''collective average use of postconsumer recycled fiber'' -- paper made with previously used material -- to a 30 percent average in 2011 from a 5 percent average today. According to the Green Press Initiative, the nonprofit organization shepherding the effort, this would conserve an estimated 524 million pounds of greenhouse gases annually -- the equivalent of keeping 45,800 cars off the road -- and save 4.9 million trees, 2.1 billion gallons of water and 264 million pounds of solid waste each year. 
 Among other things, the treatise also sets guidelines for the provenance of nonrecycled paper, or ''virgin sheets,'' in greenie nomenclature. ''Large publishers and others have been debating the issues for years now,'' said Tyson Miller, the director of the Green Press Initiative. He said the treatise ''sets goals and a process for actually doing something about the book industry's social and environmental impacts.'' If more publishers bought in bulk, market demand would drive the price of recycled paper down. ''We want to see an economy of scale develop,'' Miller said.
 But how green can an industry ever be whose product depends on felled trees and toxic ink? While hardly strip mining, the publishing industry's sales strategy is famously based on waste. Return rates for books average 25 percent, which means bookstores return one in four books unsold to publishers, who pay to have them pulped. And in a business with relatively small profit margins, how much are publishers willing to pay to be virtuous? It's hard to imagine carbon offsetting becoming widespread -- except as part of the publicity strategy for select titles. While the Green Press Initiative cites a study showing that some buyers, especially women, would be willing to pay as much as $1 more for a book printed on recycled paper, publishers aren't always willing to pay the extra cost up front. It's difficult to get clear estimates of the price difference, but industry experts say it typically runs 4 to 6 percent higher. In recent years, several companies have developed lines of book-quality recycled paper, which is generally made by bleaching the ink out of once-virgin fiber and reconstituting it into new paper.
 Random House, which has not signed the Green Press Initiative's treatise, describes its own recycled-paper push as ''a multimillion dollar investment'' it's prepared to shoulder without raising book prices. Peter Olson, the company's chief executive, decided the time had come ''to stop making eye-rolling excuses about how burdensome and expensive environmental initiatives are,'' Stuart Applebaum, the chief spokesman for Random House, said in an e-mail message. The company has pledged that 10 percent of the paper it uses will ''derive from recycled paper fibers'' by 2007, rising to 30 percent in 2010 -- though the percentage of recycled content in its papers will vary. (The New York Times Company uses an average of 27 percent recycled content in its newsprint.) Random House says its nonrecycled paper will come from ''well-managed forests credibly certified by a third party.'' 
 Some powerful authors, including Alice Walker, Barbara Kingsolver and Alice Munro, have insisted their books be published on paper with recycled content. But not all writers have as much sway with their publishers. In her 2005 book, ''Garbage Land,'' about what happens to the things we throw away, the science writer Elizabeth Royte described her unsuccessful efforts to persuade her publisher, Little, Brown, to print the book on recycled paper. ''It just goes to show how hard it is to move the bottom-line culture, even with a book that's a natural fit for recycled paper,'' Royte said. (Little, Brown didn't return requests for comment.)
 Paradoxically, the greenest book on the market may be one made not from paper, but from -- the horror! -- plastic. In their 2002 environmental manifesto, ''Cradle to Cradle,'' William McDonough, the green architecture pioneer, and Michael Braungart, a German chemist, argue that traditional recycling just delays the trip to the landfill, and push for developing reusable materials. (Paper can be recycled only about three times before it's no longer high enough quality to use for books; lower quality papers can be recycled about seven times.) To prove their point, they had the book published on plastic -- DuraBook, a patented material developed by Melcher Media, a book packager and publisher in New York that also produced Al Gore's book. ''The medium is the message,'' McDonough said in a telephone interview. ''The planet is awash in plastic, literally . . . so why not use plastic for books instead of paper?'' The book can be melted down and used to make new books or other products, which themselves could be melted down again. ''We need plastics. We're not going to go back to nature,'' McDonough said. ''We're not going back to being hunter-gatherers. The best thing is to use them.'' 
 Published by North Point Press and printed in China, ''Cradle to Cradle'' has sold steadily, and now has 100,000 copies in print in its English edition. It cost one-third more to produce than a traditional book, McDonough said, so the authors agreed to take lower royalties. (The foreign-language editions are printed on paper.) For their next book, which will further elaborate their ideas on green design and reusable materials, McDonough said he and Braungart are experimenting with ''a surprising new material,'' also synthetic, as well as inks safe for use with food. He declined to be more specific. Time will tell whether McDonough and Braungart will make eco-skeptics eat their words.

HEADLINE: Tensions Over Missile Tests Rattle Investors

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
North Korea fired test missiles while Wall Street rested on the Fourth of July, rattling stock markets around the world. The next day, when Wall Street returned to work, stocks fell sharply. Despite a modest rally on Thursday, the market finished lower for the week. 
 On Friday, there was another apparent cause for the market's weakness -- a warning by 3M, the technology company, that second-quarter earnings would be lower than expected because the demand for flat-panel TV screens was soft. Its shares dropped 8.7 percent for the week, and 3M's problems set off declines for a host of other stocks.
General Motors' shares, however, rose 7.4 percent for the week. Its board decided to study an alliance with Nissan Motor and Renault, which Kirk Kerkorian, a dissident G.M. shareholder, had demanded.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average shed 59.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 11,090.67. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 1,265.48. The Nasdaq composite index fell 42.03 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 2,130.06. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell slightly, to 5.13 percent from 5.14 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: New York's Energy Future

 BODY:
For a city that gobbles energy like contestants at the Coney Island hot dog eating contest, it was surprising to learn recently, from Mayor Michael Bloomberg's energy task force, that New York won't be needing new power plants until at least 2012. That's a very different report than one issued just two years ago, which said the city would be needing 25 percent more energy generation by 2008. The turnaround is a result, in part, of the city's aggressive conservation and efficiency goals under Mr. Bloomberg. But the city is hardly out of the woods on energy.
 Demand continues to grow, by some 150 megawatts per year. Several plants that have come online in the last two years provide about 10 times that amount, which helps. But this is a city with aging power plants and huge new development projects in its future, including areas like Manhattan's West Side and Brooklyn's downtown. 
To keep the lights on and the economy booming, the hard work lies just ahead. By law, New York must generate 80 percent of its own power, and it must meet a reliability standard that requires producing more than it needs, about 30 percent more than what might be called for on a peak use day.
 The task force operates out of the city's Economic Development Corporation and includes representatives from private, public and nonprofit sectors, including the Natural Resources Defense Council. It deserves praise for its work so far, but that work is far from done; assuring reliable energy is a continuing challenge. 
 Conservation measures, large and small, figure prominently in the task force's game plan. The Green City Buildings Act, signed into law last October, requires large nonresidential projects to meet environmentally sound energy-efficiency standards, and the mayor has required the same of government construction. The city replaced refrigerators in some 180,000 subsidized apartments with models using 75 percent less energy than older models, and even switched pedestrian traffic signals from old-style bulbs to much more efficient light-emitting diodes.
 The biggest undertaking is an effort to decrease energy demand, especially at peak times, like the air-conditioned days of summer. One key initiative is Con Edison's plan to reduce peak demand by 675 megawatts over three years by using financial incentives to entice consumers to cut back on peak days, which they can do by turning off some lights and equipment. The goal is lofty and by no means assured. 
 In addition, the task force needs to find some way to encourage more investment in generating capacity. Two factors above all have discouraged Wall Street. One is deregulation. Whatever its other virtues, deregulation has made markets more uncertain. The other is the failure in recent years of several large energy concerns, including Enron. This has also made investors and lenders skittish. 
 One way to address these fears is to encourage retailers of energy, like Con Edison, to commit to longer-term contracts that promise future returns, as happened with the SCS Astoria 500-megawatt plant in Queens. The same goes for efforts to build transmission lines to bring power from northern New York state and from New Jersey. Without assurances that there will be a buyer for the power, investors will not step forward.
 Albany has also contributed to the mess by its failure to renew the law that allows timely decisions on the siting of new power plants. This, too, discourages builders and investors.
 Meanwhile, plants now providing a total of 3,000 megawatts are using old technology that should be replaced. New and readily available technology could double their efficiency. 
 The business of forecasting a city's energy appetite will always be an imprecise science. But now, at least, New York has a mayor who is giving the subject the attention it deserves.

HEADLINE: Mexico Faces Its Own Red-Blue Standoff 

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
NO matter who wins the election in Mexico, where the leftist and conservative candidates are locked in a legal battle over the outcome, the voters have pulled the curtain back on a new political landscape for the country. In the end, who won may not be nearly as important as who lost. The candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ruled the country with an iron hand for 70 years, did not win a single state. Worse, the P.R.I., as the party is known, lost its hold on Congress, slipping from the largest faction to third largest.
 In short, the declining former ruling party finally crashed and burned. And from the wreckage have risen two invigorated, growing -- and quite evenly matched -- parties, Felipe Calderon's National Action Party, or P.A.N., and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's Party of the Democratic Revolution, the P.R.D. 
''What's happened, I think, is that in fact we have a new panorama,'' said Daniel Lund, a pollster and political analyst. ''Two parties have emerged that are not the dual heirs of the P.R.I.''
 And they look a lot like the Republicans and Democrats or Britain's Tories and Labor. 
 The two parties are roughly divided along the left-right lines that appear throughout Latin America today. The right supports free trade and privatization; the left opposes globalization and favors more welfare programs. But they are not so much at odds on the country's broad needs and goals -- national pride, a rate of development that matches that of countries like Brazil and Chile, and avenues by which the poor can move upward. 
 One striking feature is a split along regional lines. Mr. Calderon took most of the northern states, while Mr. Lopez Obrador dominated the central and southern states. So Mexico's new map has its own version of America's red state-blue state phenomenon, and it is so evenly balanced that the presidential race produced a virtual tie.
 Last week, when Mr. Calderon was declared the victor by a margin of less than 1 percent of the vote and Mr. Lopez Obrador vowed to fight in the courts for a recount, the stalemate raised the prospect of more polarization -- and, perhaps, a bitter stalemate.
 The new map depicts an industrialized north, where business ties to the United States have played an enormous role in the rise of the right-leaning, conservative party, and a more agricultural south that is a hotbed of leftist discontent and anti-globalization sentiment. Political scientists say this has a little to do with history and a lot to do with economics.
 For starters, the benefits of the 1994 free trade agreement with the United States and Canada have never trickled down to southern states like Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero. While the economy in the north has grown at 4.5 percent a year, the southern states have barely grown 1 percent each year. They remain largely agricultural and poor, with big indigenous populations. 
 It was in Chiapas in 1994 that the Zapatista rebels, mostly descendants of Mayan Indians, rose up and became heroes for opponents of globalization everywhere.
 In the north, meanwhile, border cities have swollen as migrants continue their inexorable march northward, and maquiladoras, the factories that assemble products for American companies, spring up like wildflowers along the Rio Grande and the rest of the border.
 Even in agriculture there is a clear difference. The south holds on to the old system of ejidos, or cooperative farms, that was established after the 1910 revolution. Most farmers produce only for their own consumption or a little for the local market.
 The north, however, is dominated by large modern farms, much like those in California, producing everything from tomatoes to chiles for export. Many people from the south are moving north to work as pickers, because the pay is better.
 The P.A.N. has its roots in the north. Founded in 1926, it served as a haven there for those fed up with the P.R.I. machine, which was little more than a dictatorship in democratic clothing. The P.A.N. won its first governorship in the north, in the late 1980's, and began the long march to power that led to the victory in 2000 by its candidate, Vicente Fox.
 Now, that march is being followed by the emergence of a vigorous two-party system. Even if he ultimately loses, Mr. Lopez Obrador has united his party's warring factions and doubled its presence in Congress. ''Andres Manuel is the P.R.D.,'' said Federico Arreola, a former columnist and newspaper owner who worked on the Lopez Obrador campaign. 
 The P.R.D.'s ability to dislodge the old rulers of the P.R.I. in the south crystallized only in the late 1990's, when Mr. Lopez Obrador, the national chairman of his party, tapped longstanding anger over the oppressive tactics of the old ruling party. He won a term as mayor of Mexico City in 2000, and last year the party won the governorship of Guerrero. 
 Now, with the P.R.I. unraveling, its members have been drifting into the other two parties. In the south, they have flocked to Mr. Lopez Obrador, who has promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, subsidize farmers, fix prices for corn and beans, cut prices for energy, spend more on welfare programs, and build refineries, trains and roads to provide jobs. 
 The biggest question now is whether the two main parties can learn to work together after a divisive election. During Mr. Fox's six-year term, the P.R.I. sabotaged most of his reforms in Congress. 
 In the new landscape, such tactics from whichever side loses the presidency could paralyze Mexico's development and spur an even greater flood of immigrants to the United States. Multiparty democracy is young here, the idea of bipartisan cooperation has yet to take root, and the prospect that a razor-thin election will yield only partisanship already scares some Mexicans.
 ''We cannot have another six years of a country in gridlock,'' said Rossana Fuentes Berain, the editor of the Spanish-language Foreign Affairs.

HEADLINE: His Hipness, John G. Roberts

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WRITING in April for a unanimous Supreme Court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. found that the police in Brigham City, Utah, acted properly in entering a home without a warrant after they peered through a window and saw a fight in progress that had left one man spitting blood. 
 ''The role of a police officer includes preventing violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties,'' the chief justice said, rejecting the argument that the police should have waited until the altercation ended more conclusively. ''An officer is not like a boxing (or hockey) referee, poised to stop a bout only if it becomes too one-sided,'' he explained.
The chief justice's sports imagery galvanized the legal blogs. Some found his boxing reference inapt. ''The whole point of boxing is fighting!'' wrote a participant on the Althouse blog, run by Ann Althouse, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin. 
 Others took issue with the hockey reference. ''Given all the padding that hockey players wear, being punched by an opponent hardly is more significant than being hit by a toddler,'' one said.
 Finally, another writer took a step back and observed that ''this shows another side of Roberts as a good writer: displaying some wry humor and hipness.''
 It is no surprise that the new chief justice's every vote is being tabulated and scrutinized. But so is his every metaphor. Beyond John Roberts the chief justice, what has this first term revealed about John Roberts the judge? 
 He wrote eight majority opinions, roughly his fair share, given that there were 69 opinions to divide among the nine justices. He also wrote three dissenting opinions and two concurrences. While not a huge body of work, it is enough to convey at least a preliminary sense of his judicial voice.
 It is direct, straightforward, free of legal jargon, the voice of a lawyer who made a living selling complicated ideas to busy appellate judges under tight time constraints. 
 Prof. Erwin Chemerinsky of Duke University Law School, who spent the past week editing the term's cases for inclusion in his constitutional law textbook, said that the Roberts opinions were refreshingly easy to edit compared with those of most other justices. ''His prose style is clear and easy to follow,'' Professor Chemerinsky said. ''He tells you right in the first paragraph exactly what the case is about.''
 Prof. Akhil Amar of Yale Law School praised the Roberts style for ''elegance and economy'' as well as for the ''occasionally snappy line'' that could crystallize a case for lay readers. He gave two examples. One was a majority opinion that rejected the government's application of federal narcotics law to stop a Brazil-based religious group from importing a hallucinogenic tea for use in its rituals. ''The government's argument echoes the classic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I make an exception for you, I'll have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions,'' the chief justice wrote.
 The second was a majority opinion that found that the state of Arkansas had denied due process to a homeowner by seizing and selling his house for nonpayment of property taxes without taking reasonable steps to notify him of his jeopardy. Referring to Gary K. Jones, the homeowner, Chief Justice Roberts wrote: ''In response to the returned form suggesting that Jones had not received notice that he was about to lose his property, the state did -- nothing.''
 ''That little dash is brilliant,'' Professor Amar said. ''Every ordinary citizen can understand the frustration of dealing with government stupidity.''
 Among legal academics, the Roberts opinion that received by far the most attention was the one rejecting a constitutional challenge to the Solomon Amendment, under which universities forfeit all federal grants if they fail to open their doors to military recruiters. A group of law schools argued that the statute violated their rights to free speech and association.
 As the case reached the court, many law professors who had supported the challenge began to have second thoughts, fearful that the First Amendment argument, if accepted, would undermine many anti-discrimination laws by permitting bigots to opt out in the name of free association. Even liberals, or perhaps especially liberals, were therefore relieved by the chief justice's conclusion that because the law regulated neither speech nor association, but merely conduct, it raised no First Amendment problem.
 Jack Balkin, a professor at Yale Law School, said on his blog that the chief justice's opinion ''was carefully and skillfully written to make almost no new law.'' Professor Balkin said the opinion made the case ''look easy by artfully dodging every interesting constitutional law question in sight.''
 That raises the question of whether the chief justice's performance conforms to his own stated goal: to be a ''minimalist'' judge who decides no more than necessary, an umpire simply calling balls and strikes. The answer is yes, and no.
 ''He's 'minimalist' in recognizing that the court is an ongoing enterprise with precedents and history and tradition,'' said Frederick Schauer, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ''He is not coming in with a big new theory or a big new perspective.'' 
 On the other hand, the chief justice joined opinions by Justice Antonin Scalia in environmental and criminal cases that reached beyond the specific disputes at hand to call long-settled assumptions into question. And several of his opinions had a rhetorical edge. ''It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race,'' he wrote in dissent from a decision that enforced the Voting Rights Act to invalidate a Texas Congressional district.
 His seeming allergy to citing law review articles, or any other sources outside the body of the court's published opinions, is a striking feature of the Roberts approach. ''It's as if the answers to all questions are already there, completely internal to the court, to be teased out of the existing cases,'' said David Barron, a professor at Harvard Law School. 
 Chief Justice Roberts, a former managing editor of the Harvard Law Review, has cited only a single law review article, one written by Judge Henry Friendly, for whom he clerked on the federal appeals court in New York. It was a tip of the hat in his first opinion.
 Relying on precedent as the only source of law is an approach with strengths and weaknesses, Professor Barron said, noting that on the one hand, precedent can be a smokescreen, ''a rhetorical device to hide the inevitable policy making,'' while on the other, ''it has its own constraining effects,'' making a judge less likely to embrace dramatic change in the status quo.
 Whether John Roberts's first year is a good predictor of his 10th, 20th or 30th is an open question. According to a new study by the political scientists Lee Epstein and Jeffrey A. Segal, Chief Justice Earl Warren voted against criminal defendants and civil rights litigants 62 percent of the time during his first term. Eventually, of course, he became their champion.
 But such a trajectory is rare. The other chief justices of the last 50 years, Fred M. Vinson, Warren E. Burger and William H. Rehnquist -- Chief Justice Roberts's mentor -- all stayed true to their early form.

HEADLINE: The Difference a Teacher Makes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As a public school teacher, I appreciated ''Teachers Matter,'' your July 4 editorial drawing attention to the importance of highly trained teachers and the difference they can make in students' learning.
That this difference is especially noticeable in our students from economically disadvantaged homes underlines the need to put the best teachers in classroom where they will have the greatest impact. 
 But take a hard look at the work life of an urban public school teacher. 
 Most need more planning time, better salaries, opportunities for collaboration, better-supplied classrooms and smart and strong administrators. 
 Add to that rigorous training opportunities that are informative and practical rather than ideological. Long summer breaks should be ditched and replaced with shorter breaks throughout the school year.
 Yes, we need the most effective, talented teachers for our neediest students. Rigging the job so that it is more professionally satisfying and less emotionally exhausting might attract them.

Barbara Yost Williams
Madison, Wis., July 5, 2006

To the Editor:
 ''Teachers Matter'' (editorial, July 4) raises a question of educational equity that is more important than redressing financial imbalances that exist: 
 Is it fair that poor and minority students have a disproportionate number of teachers with limited training and experience? 
 In 1994 in the New York City public schools, the proportion of uncertified teachers ranged from fewer than 2 percent in Queens (Districts 25 and 26) and Staten Island to greater than 20 percent in five Harlem and South Bronx districts. 
 That's 12 years ago -- time for a complete K-12 generation of economically disadvantaged children to enter the system and graduate with a second-class education.
 And let's not be fooled that today's ''certified'' teachers are well trained. The New York State education commissioner has set up a spectrum of credentials that allow a hollow claim to be made that all teachers are now certified. 
 It would be revolutionary if the No Child Left Behind Act improved the quality of teaching and held teaching programs to high standards, rather than holding students -- doubly handicapped by poverty and poor teachers -- to dubious achievement test criteria.

Fred Smith
Brooklyn, July 5, 2006

The writer, a former public schools administrative analyst, wrote teacher staffing reports to the state commissioner for the schools chancellor.

To the Editor:
 ''Teachers Matter'' did not address a key question: What are states doing to attract highly qualified teachers to the classrooms where they are most needed? 
 Who wants to -- or can -- teach with inadequate and unsafe facilities, an insipid code of discipline, overcrowded classrooms and campuses, and district-imposed curriculums that rely on a publishing company's script to teach? 
 Top this with a system of social promotion that tells K-8 students it's O.K. to fail because they'll move up to the next grade regardless of their inability to read or understand basic arithmetic. 
 So, rather than call for new certification processes, insist that states improve conditions in low-performing schools to help children learn and to attract and keep highly qualified teachers. 
 If we want highly qualified teachers in our classrooms, it's going to take more than standardizing certification processes. It's going to require schools that deserve them. 

Jamie O'Halloran
Los Angeles, July 5, 2006

The writer is a public school teacher.

To the Editor:
 There is absolutely no question that well-prepared, highly qualified and competent teachers make a difference in the academic, emotional and social lives of poor and minority children. The most daunting challenge is to change societal attitudes toward the teaching profession so that salaries are commensurate with talent and need.
 Parents and teachers themselves can effect change by encouraging their best and brightest to pursue the most honorable and personally rewarding of professions. If those who can, teach, having a qualified teacher in every classroom will secure our place in the global economy.

HEADLINE: Boys and Girls in School

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The school where I teach does not parallel ''What Boy Crisis?,'' by Judith Warner (column, July 3). 
Next year my Advanced Placement language classes are composed of 32 girls and 11 boys; the A.P. composition teacher has a greater gender ratio disparity. 
 In my school the number of ''girl books'' has outweighed the ''boy books'' for at least a decade. ''The Catcher in the Rye'' collects dust while ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' is touted as the best sophomore book -- I do not know if this is student or teacher driven, just that it is apparent when I look at the dust balls around the edge of the stacks of J. D. Salinger's famous novel.
 Our school is in a typical 99 percent white, rural southern Maine school district, and there are similar correlations between economic and academic poverty. Where are tomorrow's well-educated women going to find comparable husbands? How many female and male or rich and poor or variegated minds are we losing?

HEADLINE: Day Laborers, Silent and Despised, Find Their Voice

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
Illegal immigrants are a diverse bunch. There are about 12 million in this country, working in all industries and living in a range from middle class to working poor to something well below that. They are mostly Latino, but are Asian, African and Eastern European, too. The illegal Irish get a lot of press, but are just one tiny subset, a green sprig of parsley in the melting pot.
 Of all these ethnic and economic subgroups, the one I find most compelling is the quiet one at the bottom: the Latino day laborers, the street-corner guys. 
They are not the largest group, but they are the most visible, most vulnerable and most hated. They are also the least likely to get anything good out of the immigration bills now festering in Congress.
 It takes nothing from the punishing toil of farm workers, hotel maids, wilderness firefighters and chicken processors to say that day laborers occupy a position of particular risk and hardship in these times of immigration panic.
 They are silent and anonymous, but painfully exposed. They are jeered by suburbanites, harassed by Minuteman vigilantes and hounded by communities with police crackdowns, anti-loitering statutes and mass evictions. Contractors cheat them. People beat them up and firebomb their homes. 
 The possibility of being victimized without sympathy or a safety net is, of course, the risk one takes when entering this country illegally. 
 Day laborers are acutely aware of this and have set out to improve things on their own. In a development that may surprise those who see day laborers as immigration at its chaotic worst, this ad hoc phenomenon is shaping itself up. 
 Through a growing national network of job centers and hiring halls, day laborers are organizing, finding allies and pressing for better treatment. 
 They are energized by a sense that hard work and suffering are antidotes to shame, and that even the shunned and excluded can push back.
 A coalition of worker groups around the country founded the National Day Laborer Organizing Network in 2000 to press for its members' rights. At a national conference last year at Hofstra University on Long Island, delegates from 12 states met to share strategies. 
 In many areas, laborers have formed de facto unions, refusing to work for less than $10 an hour. In places that have tried to force them out, like Redondo Beach, Calif., and Mamaroneck, N.Y., workers and their allies have filed federal lawsuits on First Amendment grounds. 
 The National Day Laborer Organizing Network is forging alliances with organized labor, like the Laborers' International Union of North America, which represents 700,000 construction workers, to fight for hiring sites and safer working conditions.
 The immigration bills languishing in Congress offer very little promise for day laborers. Even the most generous legislation denies a path to legal status for the newest immigrants and those who can't prove steady employment, which leaves many day laborers out of luck.
 The day laborers' group held a forum in a Manhattan church basement recently to discuss the bills, and the general mood was pessimistic. Members spoke of a disconnect between grass-roots organizations like theirs and the large immigrant-advocacy groups in Washington. They had little good to say about the Senate bill, which has been held up by many immigrant advocates as the best deal obtainable. 
 Such resentment may sound out of place for people who broke the law to get here. But while day laborers may be the most loathed illegal immigrants, you could also call them the least illegal. They don't misrepresent their identities as they contract independently for jobs off the books. They don't steal Social Security numbers or submit false work papers. They just work.
 Members of the day laborers' network talk about ways their organization and other grass-roots groups would make their case to a public that isn't buying it. They have begun a hearts-and-minds campaign, seeking to win friends by cleaning up parks and highways while building up political clout with lobbying and protests.
 But even if they can pull it off, the odds are against the strategy working. It's been hard enough getting the country behind even limited immigration reform. 
 If and when Congress ever gets around to fixing immigration, the illegal immigrants who benefit -- if any -- will be the ones seen as the worthiest, most promising and least threatening. 
 There will be no room for those at the margins, and that, practically by definition, is where the day laborers are -- waiting, and working.

HEADLINE: The New York Paradox

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
I live and work in New Jersey, but I've always loved the energy and variety of the city that's just an hour's train ride away. So I was happy to read in The New York Times about a New York success story: the surprising resurgence of Manhattan as a site for corporate headquarters.
 What's interesting about the corporate return to Manhattan is that it flies in the face of today's conventional wisdom, which says that modern technology is making geography irrelevant. Since work can now be done anywhere, the story goes, jobs move wherever the wages and other costs of doing business are lowest. And this should mean trouble for a high-wage, high-cost location like New York. 
But somebody forgot to tell New York about the new rules: in spite of high costs, the city's economy is thriving. 
 And the report on the headquarters boom suggests that New York may, paradoxically, be doing well precisely because technology has made it possible to move many jobs away from high-cost locations.
 During the 1960's and 1970's, New York lost much of its historical role as a headquarters city, as companies moved out to suburban campuses around the country. ''But in the last several years,'' the Times article declares, ''New York has regained its magnetic force'': there are more than twice as many headquarters and subsidiaries in the city as there were in 1990. 
 Why are corporations moving back to New York? Manhattan's appeal is obvious: the Big Apple is the best place for top executives to ''network face to face with their peers in the hub of the financial, legal and communications industries,'' as the article puts it. But that's an advantage New York has offered ever since it became America's largest city. 
 In the past, however, this face-to-face communication came at a high price: in order to keep their top executives in Manhattan, companies also had to pay the rent on large office buildings and fill those buildings with thousands of lower-level employees, paying those employees wages high enough to compensate for New York's high cost of living. Many companies decided that the benefits of a New York headquarters weren't worth the cost. 
 Now, however, it's possible for many of the people who would formerly have worked at corporate headquarters to work somewhere else instead, communicating with management electronically. And that makes it worthwhile to move top executives back to the center of things.
 The same thing may be happening in the financial industry, which these days is New York's principal ''export'' -- that is, New Yorkers sell all sorts of things to each other, but they mainly sell financial services to other Americans and the rest of the world. 
 If you looked only at the employment numbers, you might think that New York's export base is in trouble. A recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York points out that over the past 30 years, finance-sector employment has been shifting away from New York City toward lower-cost locations, both in the outer parts of the New York metropolitan area and in places like Dallas and San Antonio. 
 But what seems to be happening is that only relatively low-paid finance jobs are moving out of New York, while highly paid jobs are actually moving in. The Fed study shows that New York's share of U.S. financial industry earnings, as opposed to employment, is actually higher now than it was in 1970. And it's a good guess that financial firms, like corporate headquarters, find it easier to put their top people in New York now that the back-office work can be carried out someplace cheaper. 
 The story of the New York economy isn't entirely a happy one. The city has essentially lost all of its manufacturing, and it's now in the process of outsourcing both routine office work and many middle-management functions to other parts of the country. 
 What's left is an urban economy that offers a mix of very highly paid financial jobs and low-wage service jobs, with relatively little in the middle. Economic disparities in New York, as in the United States as a whole, are wider than they have been since the 1920's.
 But for once, let me focus on the positive: the world's greatest city, a city that a generation ago seemed to be in irreversible decline, seems to be doing O.K.

HEADLINE: Chafing at a Plan To Add Power Lines To the Landscape

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: OTISVILLE, N.Y., July 5 

 BODY:
When Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the debate focused on ways to expand energy production to meet broad national needs. Little thought was given to cozy New York hamlets like Narrowsburg, Otisville or Callicoon-on-the-Delaware.
 But these towns on bucolic byways stand right in the path of the new law, and they have become the setting for one of the first showdowns between new federal powers and longstanding state authority in determining where massive power transmission systems can go.
The battle here is over a proposed private commercial project that would run a 190-mile-long chain of high-voltage transmission towers from near Utica, within sight of parts of the ruggedly beautiful Upper Delaware River to Orange County, north of New York City.
 When completed in 2011, the project, which would cost $1.6 billion to build, would transport surplus electricity from upstate New York to downstate power companies to meet the city's growing energy needs. 
 But opponents say the towers, averaging 120 feet tall, would be an unsightly blight and hinder tourism in the region near the Upper Delaware, a federally designated wild and scenic river that is home to nesting bald eagles. They are also concerned about the effect on property values and the potential health effects of the high-voltage lines.
 So far, one state official after another has come out against the power line, siding with the rural towns fighting a power system that would only benefit the city where the lights never go out. Now the project's best chances seem to lie with federal regulators using the broad powers given in the 2005 energy act.
 ''It looks like the final decision is going to be made at the federal level, and that makes me worried,'' said Michael D. Hornbuckle, owner of Otisville Hardware, a store in this Orange County town of about 1,000 residents, 70 miles northwest of New York City. 
 Like Otisville, communities elsewhere in the country will almost certainly be forced to contend with the same obscure provision tucked into the 1,700-page energy bill that was signed by President Bush last year. 
 That provision allows the Department of Energy to designate almost any area of the country a ''national interest electric transmission corridor'' if it determines that building new transmission lines there would eliminate congestion and relieve electricity bottlenecks. Within those corridors, federal regulators could pre-empt state jurisdiction in the siting of transmission lines and private builders could be granted the power of eminent domain to get the right of way on private property. 
 The Department of Energy has already received 10 applications for national corridor designation. Some cover densely populated areas like the San Francisco peninsula. But several others, like the one in New York, which was filed in March, would cross rural towns and villages as well as forests and farmland. One corridor would run about 400 miles from West Virginia coal country through southwestern Pennsylvania and across the lower Delaware River into New Jersey. New York City itself has filed an application for a corridor crossing the Hudson River into the city from New Jersey. 
 Most of the corridor applications are not yet linked to specific construction projects. But the one through upstate New York is well into the development stage.
 Under the current proposal, a line of towers would run through Mr. Hornbuckle's property, parallel to the two-block-long Main Street, where no building is taller than 25 feet. Construction would displace the parking lot behind his store, along with a building he owns across the street that houses a real estate office and two apartments. 
 ''It's going to divide the town directly in half,'' Mr. Hornbuckle said, ''and I don't know of any benefit it will bring to the people of Otisville at all.'' 
 The transmission line project, called the New York Regional Interconnection, N.Y.R.I., would do far more than divide Otisville. As it was formally presented to the State Public Service Commission in late May, the 1,200-megawatt line would cross 154 streams or rivers, 155 mapped wetlands, 65 miles of farmland, seven counties, one city, seven villages and 30 towns. 
 Along Route 97, which follows the Delaware River the 71 miles from Port Jervis to Hancock, canoe carriers can outnumber cars, and placards opposing the power lines have sprouted on many lawns.
 ''Ironically, lots of New Yorkers come up here to get away from the city,'' said Patrick Carullo, president of the Upper Delaware Preservation Coalition, which opposes the project. Mr. Carullo and his wife, Marcia, moved to Narrowsburg after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 The line would be the first major transmission project constructed in New York State since the New York Power Authority's 207-mile Marcy South line from Utica downstate to Dutchess County was completed in 1988 after a bitter legal battle. 
 The president of N.Y.R.I., Richard Muddiman, also led an earlier attempt in 2003 to build a 360-mile-long transmission line to the city that would have been underground. (Burying cables is vastly more expensive than building overhead tower lines.)
 The project is financed by American Consumer Industries, an investment holding company with no connection to any existing power company, and other unnamed private investors. 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani's Washington law firm, Bracewell & Giuliani, is representing the company in the federal regulatory process. 
 William G. May, the project manager, said the need for the new line was clear. The state's electric grid is aging and becoming less reliable, he said. Less expensive surplus energy from the northwestern part of the state can provide a kind of electricity insurance to a big power user like New York City. 
 Conservation and load management efforts in the city over the last few years have helped to curb electricity consumption. But demand is growing, and there are times when existing transmission lines become congested, creating bottlenecks that can threaten the entire system. 
 ''This is about a better transfer of power from upstate to downstate,'' Mr. May said. An added benefit is that surplus upstate power is cheaper and could provide energy cost savings in the city, but electricity prices upstate will probably increase as downstate users drive up demand. 
 Mr. May acknowledged that the project's opponents were very vocal, but there are eight million people in New York City who depend on a reliable energy system, he said. ''The people in Callicoon do not live on an island,'' he said. ''They benefit from an energy system in the state of New York, and when that system becomes unreliable, we all have an issue.'' 
 In May, a public meeting in Callicoon drew a boisterous crowd. The route of the transmission line was not known then, but many at the meeting feared that the company planned to use a 19th-century railroad right of way along the New York and Pennsylvania sides of the river for the towers. 
 (About 90 percent of the line would be built within or adjacent to existing railroad, gas or electricity rights of way, according to the project's developers. Acquiring land or rights of way will cost $70 million, Mr. May said, and the company will pay full property taxes, amounting to about $30 million a year.)
 N.Y.R.I. executives now say that the river route is not their preferred route, and have listed it in their application for approval of the project by the Public Service Commission as a required alternative to a more easterly route that comes close to the river at a few points but never touches it. Opponents have vowed to continue the fight. 
 The Public Service Commission, which will hold a series of public hearings on the project later this year, will balance public benefits against the perceived need and environmental impact, before deciding whether to approve it. 
 Richard J. Lippes, a Buffalo lawyer who will represent the preservation coalition and other opponents of the line before the Public Service Commission, said the outpouring of official opposition made approval unlikely. 
 Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, along with Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, who represents eight upstate counties including those in the Catskills, have raised questions about the project. The State Legislature passed a bill last month that strips N.Y.R.I.'s ability to use eminent domain under state law. 
 But in a rare open gesture of support for the interconnection project, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has urged Gov. George E. Pataki to veto the legislation, saying that such a law would discourage investors in energy infrastructure projects the city and state may need.
 Gil C. Quiniones, chairman of the New York City Energy Policy Task Force, has tried to stay out of the fray. He said the city generally favored expansion of the electricity transmission system because it enhances reliability and reduces energy prices. But he was unwilling to say whether he thought the regional interconnection project should be built until the Public Service Commission hearings begin.
 The final fight over the line might be held far from the city or the state. Under the 2005 law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas and oil, has the power to issue construction permits that overrule state regulators who reject a project in a federally designated national interest corridor or make it economically unfeasible. Only the Texas electricity grid was exempted from the provision after elected officials from that state helped push through the 2005 law. 
 If federal regulators do get to decide the New York project's fate, they are expected to take into account the rancor it has caused locally. Kevin Kolevar, director of the Department of Energy's electricity delivery office, said he has heard complaints about the way the project management has treated local communities. 
 ''To my experience,'' he said, ''companies that don't respect local officials have a much harder time.'' 
 The N.Y.R.I. investors believed an early national corridor designation would help their chances of getting sufficient financing, according to their application. 
 But the Energy Department has deferred all decisions until it completes a national power grid congestion study next month. In the meantime, the New York transmission line is shaping up as a classic states' rights battle, said Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's national energy program.
 ''This is stirring up a lot of concern and consternation everywhere in the country,'' he said, ''except Texas.''

HEADLINE: Suspect in Tunnel Bombing Plot Had Maps, Beirut Official Says

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Lebanese authorities found maps and bombing plans on the personal computer of a supporter of Al Qaeda who was accused of plotting to attack train tunnels between Manhattan and New Jersey, a Lebanese official said. A United States official disclosed that the man had visited the country at least once. 
 The official of the Beirut government, the acting interior minister, Ahmed Fatfat, described the information found on the computer of the man, Assem Hammoud, as ''very important.''
''It contained maps and bombing plans that were being prepared,'' Mr. Fatfat said on Saturday in a television interview in Lebanon.
 In the United States, a federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, said that Mr. Hammoud had visited the United States at least once -- a trip to California six years ago. The official said that Mr. Hammoud, who is 31, had come on a visa for a brief stay and was believed to have been visiting either family or friends. 
 Lebanese security officials said in interviews that they had obtained important information from Mr. Hammoud's computer and CD's seized from his office at the Lebanese International University, where he taught economics.
 ''This information helped the investigators make Hammoud confess to his role in plotting a terror act in America,'' one Lebanese official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
 Mr. Hammoud has been in Lebanese custody since April. Two others are also in custody in the case. United States investigators said the plot had been disrupted after coordinated efforts with officials in six other countries. Five suspects are at large.
 The F.B.I. said the suspects had planned to attack trains under the Hudson River using suicide bombers and backpack bombs.
 The plan, which authorities said the suspects had hoped to carry out in October or November, was to flood Lower Manhattan by attacking the PATH train tunnels.

HEADLINE: A Florida Mayor Turns to an Immigration Curb to Fix a Fading City

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: AVON PARK, Fla., July 6 

 BODY:
Tom Macklin, the mayor of this faded city deep in Florida's citrus belt, heard the idea on talk radio and latched on with relish.
 A city up north, Hazleton, Pa., planned to root out and punish landlords who rented to illegal immigrants, fining them $1,000 for every such tenant. Mr. Macklin, whose own small city has swelled with immigrants from Mexico, Haiti and Jamaica over the past decade, swiftly proposed the same for Avon Park.
''It was almost as if I was sitting in church at a revival and he was preaching to me,'' Mr. Macklin said of Mayor Lou Barletta of Hazleton, whom he heard promoting that city's Illegal Immigration Relief Act on the radio show last month. ''If we address the housing issue -- make it as difficult as possible for illegals to find safe haven in Avon Park -- then they are going to have to find someplace else to go.''
 Like Hazleton's proposal, Avon Park's would deny business permits to companies that knowingly hired illegal immigrants. The ordinance, which states that illegal immigration ''destroys our neighborhoods and diminishes our overall quality of life,'' would also make English the official language of Avon Park, removing Spanish from all city documents, signs and automated phone messages. 
 The proposal has some of Avon Park's roughly 8,800 residents exalting, others fuming and still others -- including those who rent rooms or apartments in the scruffy Golden Age Villas, west of the abandoned train tracks -- plain scared. The City Council passed it 3 to 2 on the first reading and is likely to adopt it July 24. 
 ''We just wouldn't be able to stay here,'' said Armando Garcia Cortes, 45, who said he came to Avon Park, about 80 miles southeast of Orlando, from Veracruz, Mexico, to pick oranges and fix roofs. ''They're going to see the farmworker population here drop. We would all be leaving.''
 John Koch, who sells glassware and model cars at the Broken Spoke Flea Market on Main Street, said that would be fine. 
 ''I think it's long overdue,'' Mr. Koch said of the proposal. ''If you don't put a cap on it, it just gets out of hand.''
 Both Mr. Macklin and Mr. Barletta said they were forced into drastic measures by the federal government's failure to crack down on illegal immigration. Both said that tightening the nation's borders would be the best solution, but that with Congress still divided on immigration policy, they had to take action.
 ''When you have people begging you to do something, there comes a breaking point,'' said Mr. Barletta, whose family settled in Hazleton when it was a thriving coal center in the early 1900's. ''I feel very confident that what we're doing is not only legal, but the right thing to do. I can't sit back and watch my city being destroyed.'' 
 Both mayors, white baby boomers who grew up in the 1960's and 70's, speak wistfully of the days when nuclear families were the only occupants of single-family homes in their towns, every resident paid taxes and English was the only language heard on the streets. Mr. Macklin said the City of Charm, as Avon Park has long called itself, no longer met that description, despite the gazebo and shuffleboard courts on Main Street, several dainty lakes and ubiquitous live oaks. 
 ''When people come to our area,'' he said, ''they see degrading neighborhoods, homes falling down among themselves, four or five vehicles parked in yards. There's a perception for those that come to this area -- looking to perhaps expand a business, move here -- that it might not necessarily be where they want to be.''
 Mr. Macklin, a Republican whose City Council is nonpartisan, said he had been bombarded with positive feedback since proposing the ordinance in late June, even getting e-mail messages from California and Illinois. But some residents have called him racist, and others, like Joe Wright, a dairy farmer who said two-thirds of his work force was Hispanic, said the ordinance would be unenforceable and unconstitutional.
 ''It's going to be impossible to police,'' said Mr. Wright, whose dairy, outside the city, has many employees who live in Avon Park. ''Are they actually going to have their zoning people and policemen racially profile every Hispanic-looking person? I mean, this just has a very chilling effect.''
 Mr. Macklin said he expected opposition from citrus growers and cattle farmers, many of whom say that they hire only workers with Social Security cards, but that they cannot be sure the cards are authentic. The law would punish only those who knowingly hired or rented to illegal immigrants, he said.
 But Mary Bauer, director of the Immigrant Justice Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the proposal violated several laws, including the Fair Housing Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. 
 ''The real problem is that it's obvious the effect of this will be to discriminate against immigrants and Latinos generally,'' Ms. Bauer said, adding that the center might sue if the ordinance passed. ''Any thinking landlord reading this would likely decide that renting to immigrants or Latinos is a risky proposition.''
 Cesar A. Perales, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, said he had sent two lawyers to meet with Hispanic groups in Hazleton recently and might sue to stop its ordinance.
 ''The Latino community is just about as angry as any I've ever seen,'' Mr. Perales said. ''They've come to Hazleton to be part of that community, and they certainly improved the economic conditions of what by most accounts was a dying town, and helped revitalize it. And they now feel they are being blamed for every ill in the city.''
 Mr. Barletta said his proposal, up for a final vote July 13, was modeled on a similar one in San Bernardino, Calif., which stalled because its proponents failed to gather enough signatures to get it on the ballot. He wrote it, he said, after illegal immigrants committed several rattling crimes in Hazleton, a city of 31,000, this year. 
 Both proposals have led to false rumors that have fanned fears in recent weeks. At the Golden Age Villas in Avon Park, Ashley Neff, 20, whose boyfriend is an illegal immigrant from Mexico, said she had heard that speaking Spanish would not be allowed in shops and restaurants.
 ''They're saying they're not even going to let people in grocery stores,'' Ms. Neff said. ''How is that fair? Even a lot of the people who are legal citizens prefer to speak Spanish because it comes easier to them.'' 
 Down the street, Patrick Graham, a Jamaican immigrant who said he was here legally, said it was foolish to force out illegal immigrants because nobody else would work in the fields and groves.
 ''I sure ain't going out there to pick any oranges,'' said Mr. Graham, who owns a window-cleaning business. ''All the hard work, the Mexicans are doing it.''
 Melva Santana, a shopkeeper who was among a crowd of whites, blacks and Hispanics eating at Taqueria Merlo on Thursday, said she feared the ordinance would encourage people who had kept their prejudices quiet to begin harassing immigrants.
 This week, Ms. Santana said, a sales clerk refused to sell her sister beer because she had a Puerto Rico driver's license, and the clerk said, ''I can't read it.''
 At the flamingo-pink Avon Motel, which has operated here for 52 years, Dale Graham, the manager, said he suspected that the proposal had come about because illegal immigrants were not only picking citrus these days but also getting construction and other higher-paying jobs. 
 ''I think they're just a scapegoat,'' Mr. Graham said. ''What it comes down to is the city is resistant to any kind of change or growth.''
 Outside the motel, a sign read: American Family Owned. Drive Safely.

HEADLINE: Bush's Shift: Being Patient With Foes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9 

 BODY:
President Bush has never made apologies for enshrining pre-emption as the defining doctrine of his first term. He has declared many times that in a post-9/11 world, presidents no longer have the luxury of waiting for the slow grinding of diplomatic give-and-take when unpredictable dictators are assembling arsenals that could threaten the United States. 
 But as he leaves for Europe and Russia this week, where the simultaneous nuclear standoffs in Iran and North Korea will top the agenda, Mr. Bush finds himself struggling to square his muscular declarations with the realpolitik of his second term after the invasion of Iraq. At every turn, and every provocation, he finds himself in an unaccustomed position: urging patience. 
''These problems didn't rise overnight, and they don't get solved overnight,'' he told reporters during an hourlong news conference in Chicago on Friday. At another point, he said: ''You know, the problem with diplomacy, it takes a while to get something done. If you're acting alone, you can move quickly.'' Underscoring the idea again, he said, ''It's painful in a way for some to watch because it takes a while to get people on the same page.''
 The Chicago news conference was notable because it seemed to mark the completion of a rhetorical journey for Mr. Bush. It is a journey that has steadily moved away, in public pronouncements -- if not the president's own thinking -- from the lines he drew in the 2002 State of the Union address. In that famous ''axis of evil'' speech, he identified the threats from Iraq, Iran and North Korea as the three most pressing post-9/11 challenges facing the United States. 
 ''We'll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side,'' he said in one of the most-quoted passages of what became the signature speech of his administration. ''I will not wait on events, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.''
 Yet to some conservatives who backed Mr. Bush's decision in Iraq, ''standing by and waiting'' is the essence of Mr. Bush's current strategy. 
 Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute wrote in The Wall Street Journal after North Korea's missile tests last week that North Korea had achieved more ''strategic successes'' under the Bush administration than it had under President Clinton.
 ''Apparently unwilling to move against North Korea's nuclear challenges by itself, and evidently incapable of fashioning a practical response involving allies and others, the Bush administration's response to Pyongyang's atomic provocations is today principally characterized by renewed calls for additional rounds of toothless conference diplomacy,'' he wrote.
 This weekend in The Weekly Standard, William Kristol, another prominent conservative voice, wrote: ''The red lines, pink lines, and mauve lines of U.S. foreign policy seem increasingly to be written in erasable ink. What was 'unacceptable' to President Bush a week ago (a North Korean missile launch) has been accepted.'' He called the current policy ''Clintonian.''
 Mr. Bush's aides, who decline to speak about their internal deliberations on North Korea and Iran for attribution, say their critics have done everything but describe a workable alternative. Iran, they note, is five or more years from a nuclear weapon -- and, in their more candid moments, they acknowledge that it has numerous options for retaliating for any military action.
 A military attack on North Korea's missile pads, they say, has always been regarded as an unacceptable risk -- even before American forces were tied up on the other side of the world. That is why they were so quick to dismiss a call two weeks ago by President Clinton's defense secretary, William Perry, and his top aide on nuclear issues, Ashton B. Carter of Harvard, to conduct a lightning, precision strike on North Korea's Taepodong 2 long-range missile before it could be tested.
 ''It sounds good,'' one of Mr. Bush's national security aides said at the time, ''until you ask yourself the question, what good is a strike if it leaves their nuclear capability untouched?''
 To Mr. Bush's critics, the question goes to the heart of the new argument over pre-emption: whether Mr. Bush, in focusing on Iraq in 2003, missed his chance. It was in January of that year, as American forces were flowing toward the Middle East, that North Korea threw out the international inspectors who had been watching over its stockpile of nuclear fuel, and withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 The action did not have the drama of a multiple-missile launchings. But unlike the test-firings, it was a clearer violation of international law. (Any country has a right to exit the treaty with 90 days' notice, but the North evicted the inspectors before that period expired.)
 But Mr. Bush made no effort then to seek sanctions at the United Nations Security Council, or to rally China and Russia to impose economic sanctions. One senior former official who was involved in the discussions said Mr. Bush was briefed on his military options to strike at the nuclear facilities before the spent fuel rods were moved -- but the options looked bad, and he turned back to the Iraq invasion plan. 
 Administration officials still defend that decision, saying that Saddam Hussein lived in a more volatile neighborhood and needed to be dealt with first. But as one senior American diplomat who was involved in the Iraq decision conceded late last week, ''The decisions we made then narrowed our options now.''
 In short, Mr. Bush is discovering the limits of his own pre-emption doctrine -- and the frustrations of its alternative. He knows, aides say, that even to hint at military action or deadlines if Iran refuses to suspend enriching uranium, or if North Korea continues to test missiles and make bomb fuel, would probably destroy any chance of getting China and Russia aboard on a common strategy.
 But failing to lay out the consequences clearly -- the kind of straight talk Mr. Bush used to say distinguished his administration's foreign policy -- may embolden Iran and North Korea to try to run out the clock, produce more nuclear material and hope for a better deal with the next president.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Two Drugs Hints at Promise for Genetic Testing

BYLINE: By Gina Kolata

 BODY:
A decade or so ago, when the revolution in genetics was getting under way, the air was heady with promises. 
 Gene tests, scientists predicted, would become an integral part of drug prescribing. No longer would patients find out too late that a drug did not work for them. No longer would they have to wait to see if they had side effects to one drug before switching to another.
Tests of their genes would make all of this clear. But with the exception of a few tests for genes on certain cancer cells, the genetics revolution has not yet happened. 
 There are many reasons. But the stories of two drugs -- one for heart failure, the other for breast cancer -- illuminate some of the difficulties as well as the immense promise that is still to come. 
 Now maybe, just maybe, the promised revolution is imminent. 
 ''We are sitting here on the edge of a very significant improvement'' in drug therapy, said Dr. David Flockhart, a professor of medicine, genetics and pharmacology at Indiana University. ''It involves no new drugs, no massive drug development program. It involves exploiting natural human variation to protect people from therapy when it will be useless.''
 One story begins with a drug that was wholly abandoned: bucindolol, a once-promising treatment for heart failure.
 Bucindolol, one in a class of drugs known as beta blockers, was tested in a large study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
 But the clinical trial was halted early after research on other beta blockers found that those drugs improved survival for most heart failure patients. The researchers studying bucindolol felt that, given these findings, it would have been unethical to continue the study because it meant giving some patients a placebo. 
 Soon, bucindolol was all but forgotten. But even if beta blockers help most heart failure patients, they do not help all, and Dr. Stephen Liggett, who researches heart failure at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, wanted to understand why. 
 Heart failure affects more than five million Americans, and it is a dire illness. It takes six months to a year of beta blocker treatment before it is clear whether the drugs are helping. With heart failure, Dr. Liggett says, a year is too long to wait. 
 The hallmark of the illness is a damaged heart, from a heart attack, viral infection, high blood pressure or unknown causes. Struggling to pump blood, the heart grows, sometimes getting so large that it fills a patient's chest. 
 Soon the lungs fill with fluid, and, with congested lungs and a heart that can barely pump, patients become so short of breath that they cannot walk across a room. Half die within five years.
 Those who respond to beta blockers, Dr. Liggett proposed, may have a slight variation in a gene that determines the structure of a protein on heart cells where the drugs attach. 
 In the meantime, Dr. Michael Bristow of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center found himself unable to give up on bucindolol. Poring through the clinical trial data, he was convinced that some patients were substantially helped, even more than they were by other beta blockers. 
 But it was not clear how to identify those patients in advance. 
 It turned out, though, that the bucindolol trial was unique in heart disease research. Genetic material is not obtained from patients in most studies, but the researchers who conducted the bucindolol trial insisted that the participants' DNA be collected and stored. 
 Dr. Bristow and Dr. Liggett realized that they had a chance to test Dr. Liggett's hypothesis. 
 They could go through the trial data and ask whether the gene variants identified responders and nonresponders to the drug.
 The gene tests succeeded, as the investigators report this week in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Responders not only did well with bucindolol, having a 38 percent reduction in their death rate, but they also did better than patients who were taking beta blockers that are already on the market.
 Now Dr. Bristow wants to resurrect bucindolol. He has licensed it, formed a company, Arca Discovery, and hired Dr. Liggett as a consultant. He is applying to the Food and Drug Administration to market the drug along with a genetic test.
 But what if bucindolol was marketed with the genetic test and the test also identified people who would do better with the beta blockers currently on the market? Which drug should they take? Should nonresponders take any beta blocker at all?
 The only way to find out would be to do a huge clinical trial of all the drugs using the genetic test, Dr. Liggett said, and who, he asked, would pay for that? Drug companies probably would not do it, he said, because it was not in their economic interest, and the government can sponsor only so many studies.
 Another drug whose fortunes may change with a genetic test is tamoxifen, which ushered in one of the greatest advances in breast cancer treatment. By starving tumors of estrogen, tamoxifen stanches their growth and saves women's lives.
 But tamoxifen must be activated by a liver enzyme and, Dr. Flockhart of Indiana University and his colleagues found, not everyone's enzymes activate the drug. 
 As many as 7 percent of white women and a significant proportion of black women have two copies of a variant gene and are unable to activate tamoxifen. Others, with one copy of the variant gene, have a greatly reduced ability to activate it. 
 ''These are huge effects -- 100-fold differences in activity,'' Dr. Flockhart said.
 He wonders, he said, if tamoxifen is restricted to responders whether it may actually be more effective than the newer drugs called aromatase inhibitors. Those drugs, unlike tamoxifen, are still under patent and are heavily marketed by their manufacturers as being 2 to 3 percent more effective than tamoxifen. But who will pay for such a comparative study?
 In the meantime, the evidence that the gene test could completely determine tamoxifen's clinical outcomes is not ironclad. ''We have one clinical trial that says it is the case,'' Dr. Flockhart said.
 Although there have been many clinical trials of tamoxifen, none collected DNA data. So it is impossible to go back, as Dr. Liggett and Dr. Bristow did, and ask if the gene test predicted whether a woman's cancer was more likely to recur if she could not activate tamoxifen.
 Dr. Flockhart, for one, bemoans the opportunities lost because DNA was not stored in clinical trials in the past. ''It really is an indictment of the oncology community,'' he said.
 Dr. Richard Weinshilboum, a pharmacogenetics researcher at the Mayo Clinic, said that may be changing. More and more studies are collecting and storing participants' DNA, and there is increasing interest in looking for genetic variations that may determine whether a person responds to a particular drug.
 The change has been a long time coming, Dr. Weinshilboum added.
 ''It has frustrated me to see the pace,'' he said. ''Sometimes from my perspective, it has been a glacial pace. But I think we have to be patient. Those of us who do the research are sometimes the least patient in trying to get the research out.'' But, he added, ''We want to be sure it's right.''

HEADLINE: Where the Cattle Herds Roam, Ideally in Harmony With Their Neighbors

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: MALTA, Mont. 

 BODY:
Dale Veseth slowly drives a pickup over dirt tracks studded with small boulders, across a prairie that the word expansive does not begin to describe. The blanket of spring-green grass stretches 40 or 50 miles in every direction, and there is not a tree in sight. 
 Birds are abundant, though. ''That's a long-billed curlew,'' Mr. Veseth said, pointing to a large brown bird running along the ground with a long curled beak, ''and look, a Western kingbird.''
Mr. Veseth raises cattle. But in a sense, he and his neighbors also raise curlews, sage grouse, prairie dogs, black-footed ferrets and other species. They are part of a program run by the Nature Conservancy to create what are called grass banks, which give ranchers rights to graze land beyond their own, in return for commitments to conserve species like the ferrets and curlews on land they already own. 
 Mr. Veseth hopes that by being part of the program he is doing well by doing good, conserving wildlife and assuring the future of his ranch out here on the mixed grass prairie of the Northern Plains. 
 The grass bank is one of several ideas to change the way beef is raised on the Western range. This historic way of life is in trouble. Across the West ranchers are raising buffalo, selling specialty beef and challenging the power of the packinghouses in an effort to make ranching more profitable. 
 The grass bank is an effort to save ranching and the prairie. At a meeting several years ago, conservationists concluded that temperate grasslands were the least protected ecosystem on the globe. The Northern mixed grass prairie here was among them, and as a result, birds that nested in the grass were, and are, in steep decline. ''Phillips County is the epicenter of biodiversity for grasslands birds,'' said Linda Poole, a bird biologist with the Nature Conservancy. 
 So in 2002, in the throes of drought, the conservancy bought the historic 60,000-acre Matador Ranch here, once part of a string of ranches from Texas to Montana. The conservancy allows 13 ranchers to graze cattle here at greatly reduced rates. In return, the ranchers agree to protect bird and wildlife habitat on their own ranches and to battle noxious weeds. A result is that the ranchers get more range than they could otherwise afford, and the conservancy protects more range than it could afford to buy.
 Traditional ranching often uses all of the forage for cattle, which harms other species. ''This land is adapted to grazers, and the wildlife is adapted to grazing,'' said Ms. Poole, who grew up on a ranch and worries that the ranching way of life is in trouble. ''What's key to conservation is the time of year it's grazed, how long the cattle are in there and when they come back.'' 
 Ranchers must also agree not to plow up rangeland, the biggest threat to the prairie. It does not make much economic sense here, where soil is poor and the weather extreme, but it is encouraged by federal subsidies.
 Ranching, when it maximizes the use of forage for cattle, reduces habitat diversity. But if cattle grazing is undertaken with other goals in mind, the range can maintain a diversity of habitats. The Baird's sparrow, for example, requires long grass that has not been grazed, while the mountain plover lives on grazed land or in a prairie dog town where the grass is a quarter of an inch tall. 
 The sage grouse, which Mr. Veseth has on his land, need a lek, a piece of ground where it can perform an elaborate courting ritual. The program has helped ranchers, although it is not yet clear how much it helps conservation. ''It helped us get our stocking rate down'' during the drought, Mr. Veseth said. ''It saved us the first year. And for the first time ranchers are benefiting from enhancing habitat for endangered species.''
 Ms. Poole said she was drawn to the program because of a prairie bird. ''Lark buntings are the inspiration for the grass bank for me,'' she said. ''If there's a drought, they go elsewhere. Ranchers can't do that.'' At least until now, she said. ''You can't survive here unless you have a drought strategy.''
 Prairie dogs are crucial to the conservancy's mission here, and the most controversial. A methodical campaign by ranchers and the federal government nearly obliterated them. They are, however, key to a healthy prairie because they provide a rich food source for numerous other species. 
 Critics agree something needs to be done but wonder if this is the tool. Curt Freese is a biologist in Bozeman with the World Wildlife Fund, which has been studying the mixed grass prairie in northern Montana and helped create a 31,000-acre reserve near here, owned by the American Prairie Foundation. A grass bank is unlike a conservation easement, which protects land in perpetuity, Mr. Freese said. ''Once you stop, there is nothing to keep the landowner from going back to harmful practices or plowing it,'' he said. 
 George Wuerthner, an opponent of grazing and an author of ''Welfare Ranching: The Subsidized Destruction of the American West,'' believes that grass banks encourage overgrazing rather than force ranchers to reduce their stock according to limits of the range. ''A grass bank is like going into more debt rather than living within your means,'' Mr. Wuerthner said. 
 Stephanie Gripne studied grass banks as part of a doctoral program at the University of Montana last year. She estimates that there are five or so in existence and five or six in various stages of start-up. But they have a fundamental problem, Ms. Gripne said: ''They are cost ineffective.''
 ''It's not a good strategy, but there aren't a lot of other strategies,'' she said. Grass banks can be cost effective, she said, if there is a way to avoid the capital outlay for a ranch, through donation or another source. 
 That is what the Quivira Coalition, a conservation group in Santa Fe, N.M., is trying to do. The group started the first grass bank, Rowe Mesa, in 1997 with grants. But grants are drying up, so it has bought a herd of cattle that it will graze. ''It has all of the costs of a ranch but none of the income,'' said Courtney White, director of the group. ''We're trying to make it pay for itself.'' 
 Ms. Poole of the Nature Conservancy said: ''It's hard to raise money for the prairie because it's subtle. For most people it's a place to go 70 miles and hour and get someplace that matters.''

HEADLINE: Japan Looks To Its Savers To Consume

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 10 

 BODY:
As early as Friday, Japan's central bank is expected to take a momentous step in the nation's economic recovery by raising interest rates, effectively for the first time in almost two decades.
 The move would send an important signal that Japan's economy, the world's second-largest after the United States, has finally emerged from a long bout of stagnant growth and falling prices. But paradoxically, economists say, the end of these ills brings a new challenge to Japanese consumers, who have not experienced a healthy economy since the 1980's.
Economists say that during Japan's years of economic struggle, consumers became cautious as wages and prices tumbled. But for the economy to keep rising, they have to start spending more freely and more often.
 Take Yusuke Yamamoto, a 29-year-old banker living in Chiba, a Tokyo suburb, whose family has been living in a cramped two-bedroom apartment in a company dormitory instead of buying a home. Mr. Yamamoto is finally stepping into the real estate market, but millions of people like him will have to keep spending if Japan's recovery is going to help propel global growth. 
 A robust domestic-led recovery in Japan would be welcome news for the world economy, coming as the United States, long the main engine of world growth, looks vulnerable to falling housing prices and signs of inflation.
 ''Consumption is finally coming back to life,'' said Naoki Iizuka, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute. ''Japan doesn't have to rely on exports anymore'' as the driving force of the economy, as it did during the long boom that began in the late 1950's when the nation emerged from the devastation of World War II, a habit that continued during short-lived recoveries in the 1990's and this decade. 
 Raising Japanese interest rates would signal a sea change. Many economists believe the central bank, the Bank of Japan, will increase rates on Friday, at the end of a two-day meeting of its governing policy board, in response to building evidence that land prices, corporate investment and employment are all at their strongest levels in a decade or more. 
 So strong is the evidence of economic acceleration, many economists say, that neither concerns of economic fallout from an investment scandal involving the bank's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, nor last week's North Korean missile tests appear likely to derail a rate increase. 
 While the bank is expected to nudge short-term rates only up to 0.25 percent, from their current target rate of zero, many say that it could be the first of several increases as the bank moves to prevent growth from overheating. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Fukui told a meeting of branch managers of the Bank of Japan that Japan's ''long-lived expansion will continue'' as the economy has ''gained a new balance.'' The one great weakness of this recovery has been lackluster consumer spending.
 While it is at least rising, it lags behind other growing parts of the economy. In the first three months of this year, corporate spending rose 3.1 percent from the previous quarter and exports rose 2.7 percent, but private consumption was up just 0.5 percent, according to government data. 
 The root of the problem, economists say, is that consumers are still not used to spending regularly in an economy that is growing at a normal rate. 
 Already known for their propensity to save, many Japanese adapted to the reality of falling prices, or deflation, by holding off even more on big purchases like homes or cars, waiting for those goods to be cheaper. Mr. Yamamoto, the banker, said he wanted to buy a home after getting married four years ago, and particularly after his wife gave birth to two children. But he did not buy a place because he feared that anything he bought was guaranteed to lose money. Late last year, however, when land prices appeared to bottom out, and news reports said borrowing rates could soon rise, Mr. Yamamoto hurried to find a place, signing a contract a few months ago to buy a four-bedroom condo for about 40 million yen, or $350,000, in a building now under construction near his current home. 
 ''Before, when you bought, you lost,'' Mr. Yamamoto said. ''Now, when you don't buy, you lose.''
 Economists say more consumers must act like Mr. Yamamoto, loosening their purse strings, if the economy is to enter a cycle of rising consumption, corporate profits and wages all reinforcing each other. But frugality remains deeply ingrained here, to an extent that may be hard to understand in the United States, which has not experienced similar deflation since the 1930's. Change will be particularly hard for younger Japanese, in their 20's and 30's, who have known only economic stagnation. 
 ''You're talking about an entire generation,'' said Paul Sheard, an economist in Tokyo for Lehman Brothers. ''Everyone in Japan has been living so long in this deflationary environment that this behavior is in the neurons of their brains.''
 Economists say early signs of a shift in mind-set are appearing across Japan, as a range of upbeat data show that growth is accelerating.
 Late last year, land prices in major cities like Tokyo began rising for the first time in 15 years; earlier this month, a Bank of Japan survey found that large corporations expected to increase spending on new factories and equipment by 11.6 percent this year, the fastest clip since 1990; in May, unemployment fell to an eight-year low of 4 percent.
 Economists expect this mounting evidence to persuade the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates for only the second time since August 1990; the bank raised rates in August 2000, but reversed the increase a few months later when the economy faltered.
 While no one expects such an embarrassing about-face this time, some economists say they do not expect a rebound in consumer sentiment to take hold until interest rates reach at least 2 percent, high enough to increase rates of return on savings accounts to noticeable levels. 
 ''People won't feel rich until their savings start earning money again,'' said Tadashi Nakamae, head of Nakamae International Economic Research, a small policy research organization. 
 He points to Bank of Japan data that shows the last 14 years of low interest rates have cost households 304 trillion yen, or nearly $2.7 trillion, in lost interest income.
 Mr. Yamamoto, the condo buyer, said he thought it would take more time to fully change consumer mind-sets here, including his own. He said he would probably delay other big expenditures, like family vacations abroad, until his salary increased. The interest rate on his bank account is nearly zero, as it has been ever since he can remember.
 ''Older people have experienced things like rising salaries and interest rates,'' he said. 
 ''But I never have. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I still doubt it will happen.''

HEADLINE: China Is Called On to Rein In Its Growing Use of Electricity 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 10 

 BODY:
The International Energy Agency on Monday called for China to revamp its electric power industry, noting that waste and inefficiency contributed to the need for the country to add enough new, mostly coal-fired, power plants every two years to equal the entire electricity generation capacity of France or Canada. 
 In a report issued at its headquarters in Paris, the energy agency was especially critical of China's decision to limit increases in electricity prices, saying that this prompted Chinese consumers and industries to use considerably more energy than they needed.
Faced with an overheating economy in 2004, the Chinese government decided to allow few price increases for power companies even though global energy prices were rising. Beijing officials have largely followed that policy since, including a slight increase on June 30, even as world oil prices have soared past $70 a barrel and coal and natural gas prices have also climbed.
 ''Energy efficiency is not good in China because prices are too low,'' the International Energy Agency's executive director, Claude Mandil, said.
 The report also urged China to set minimum efficiency standards for coal-fired power plants and to enforce air pollution standards more rigorously for these power plants. Coal fuels two-thirds of China's electricity production, and China is now the world's second-largest electricity consumer, trailing the United States.
 China's heavy reliance on coal has prompted particular concern because the burning of coal releases more carbon dioxide, relative to the electricity produced, than oil, natural gas, nuclear power or renewable energy sources like wind power. Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to global warming.
 Improving efficiency and reducing waste would allow China to slow somewhat its growth in emissions of carbon dioxide and toxic air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, by making it possible for China to burn less coal, said Jonathan Sinton, the energy agency's senior China specialist. 
 China's coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions would still double by 2030, even with power plant efficiency gains and less waste, but it will triple without these changes, the agency's study estimated.
 Chinese power companies are looking for ways to improve efficiency while reducing pollution, said Liu Deyou, chief engineer at the Beijing SPC Environment Protection Tech Engineering Company, the sulfur-filter manufacturing arm of one of five big state-owned electric utilities.
 ''Industries in China emphasize profits a lot so they all welcome energy-efficient techniques,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Technology Downgrade Weakens Market

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Technology stocks fell yesterday after Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the sector and after an earnings warning from the data storage equipment maker EMC.
 While the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose. The broader indexes were helped by merger activity and investor bets that another quarter of earnings growth at large-cap companies may lift stocks despite fears of higher interest rates and a slowing economy.
After the market close, Alcoa, the aluminum producer, said quarterly earnings rose in line with market expectations. But it reported revenue below analysts' average estimate, and shares of the company fell more than 4 percent, or $1.47, in after-hours trade after closing at $33.41, down 14 cents. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average increased 12.88 points yesterday, or 0.12 percent, to close at 11,103.55.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.86 points, or 0.15 percent, to close at 1,267.34.
 The Nasdaq composite index was down 13.13 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,116.93
 Merrill Lynch cited a lack of liquidity in cutting its rating on the technology sector.
 ''With the news flow of the last several days, I think the belief is there's just not a lot of upside in the quarter coming up,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Stifel, Nicolaus in Baltimore. ''There just doesn't seem to be anything attractive in technology from a growth standpoint.'' 
 Shares of EMC fell 6.9 percent, or 77 cents, to $10.41, after it said that its quarterly earnings and revenue would fall short of expectations as it misjudged demand and did not stock enough inventory of a new product. EMC said it expected net income of 12 cents a share, a cent lower than its earlier estimate. 
 Shares of one of its rivals, Hewlett-Packard, declined 92 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $31.93.
 Earnings at S.& P. 500 companies are forecast to rise 9.2 percent in the second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates, but warnings from the diversified manufacturer 3M and the chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices dampened the outlook.
 Helping the market, crude oil futures fell in New York as the European Union raised hopes for positive talks this week with Iran over its nuclear program. A run-up in oil prices to a record high has weighed on investors in recent weeks. 
 Crude oil for August delivery settled down 48 cents, to $73.61 a barrel.
 In corporate acquisition news, the shopping center operator Kimco Realty agreed to buy Pan Pacific Retail Properties for $2.9 billion.
 Shares of Kimco rose 54 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.41, while Pan Pacific shares were down 65 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $69.35.
 Also yesterday, the electric and gas utility WPS Resources said it agreed to acquire Peoples Energy for about $1.52 billion. WPS shares gained 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $48.51. Peoples shares climbed 42 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $39.09.
 Treasury prices ended little changed, after recovering some early losses. Treasuries had slipped earlier in the session as rising stock prices lured investors from bonds, but edged back after the run-up in equities ran out of steam. 
 The price of the benchmark 10-year note was unchanged, and the yield remained at 5.13 percent. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Meth Users, Attuned to Detail, Add Another Habit: ID Theft

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
Joe Morales, a prosecutor in Denver, can remember when crack came to his city in the 1980's. Gangs set up on Colfax Avenue and in the Five Points neighborhood, and street crime -- murders and holdups -- grew.
 When methamphetamine proliferated more recently, the police and prosecutors at first did not associate it with a rise in other crimes. There were break-ins at mailboxes and people stealing documents from garbage, Mr. Morales said, but those were handled by different parts of the Police Department.
But finally they connected the two. Meth users -- awake for days at a time and able to fixate on small details -- were looking for checks or credit card numbers, then converting the stolen identities to money, drugs or ingredients to make more methamphetamine. For these drug users, Mr. Morales said, identity theft was the perfect support system.
 While public concern about identity theft has largely focused on elaborate computer schemes, for law enforcement officials in Denver and other Western areas, meth users have become the everyday face of identity theft. Like crack cocaine in the 1980's, officials say, the rise of methamphetamine has been accompanied by a specific set of crimes and skills that are shared among users and dealers. 
 ''The knowledge of how to violate the law comes contemporaneously with the meth epidemic,'' said Sheriff Paul A. Pastor of Pierce County, Wash., who said the majority of identity theft cases his officers investigated involved methamphetamine.
 Tammie Carroll, a mother of four in Denver who was indicted in 2003 in an identity theft ring, described her social circle succinctly.
 ''Anybody I knew that did meth was also doing fraud, identity theft or stealing mail,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''We helped each other out, whatever we needed to do that day. They all had their own little role.''
 Mr. Morales, director of the Denver district attorney's economic crime unit, said 60 percent to 70 percent of his office's identity theft cases involved methamphetamine users or dealers, often in rings of 10 or more.
 ''Look at the states that have the highest rates of identity theft -- Arizona, Nevada, California, Texas and Colorado,'' Mr. Morales said. ''The two things they all have in common are illegal immigration and meth.''
 But identity thieves are difficult to generalize about because most crimes are never solved. The prevalence of meth use among identity theft suspects may say more about the state of law enforcement than about the habits of lawbreakers. In other words, meth users may simply be the easiest to catch. 
 In Denver, Mr. Morales said his office and the local police lacked the resources to pursue more sophisticated identity thieves who crossed jurisdictions or bought and sold identities over the Internet. On the other hand, he said, ''it's easy to get a meth addict to flip'' and testify against others. 
 Nonetheless, prosecutors, police officers, drug treatment professionals, former identity thieves and recovering addicts describe a connection between meth use and identity theft that is fluid and complementary, involving the hours that addicts keep, the nature of a methamphetamine high and the social patterns of meth production and use, which differ from those of other illegal drugs. 
 For example, crack cocaine or heroin dealers usually set up in well-defined urban strips run by armed gangs, which stimulates gun traffic and crimes that are suited to densely populated neighborhoods, including mugging, prostitution, carjacking and robbery. Because cocaine creates a rapid craving for more, addicts commit crimes that pay off instantly, even at high risk.
 Methamphetamine, by contrast, can be manufactured in small laboratories that move about suburban or rural areas, where addicts are more likely to steal mail from unlocked boxes. Small manufacturers, in turn, use stolen identities to buy ingredients or pay rent without arousing suspicion. And because the drug has a long high, addicts have patience and energy for crimes that take several steps to pay off.
 In a survey of 500 county sheriffs, 27 percent said methamphetamine had contributed to a rise in identity theft in their areas. Even more -- 62 percent and 68 percent, respectively -- noted that it contributed to increases in domestic abuse or robberies and burglaries. 
 ''I think identity theft is a big deal; there's a lot of it going on,'' said Terree Schmidt-Whelan, executive director of the Pierce County Alliance in Washington, which provides court-mandated drug treatment to addicts. ''But I don't think it's going on to the extent we read about because we're not seeing it to that extent here.''
 The circumstances of methamphetamine arrests, Dr. Schmidt-Whelan said, can exaggerate the connection with identity theft. ''If a sheriff does a bust and there are 10 people in a room, are they all doing it?'' she asked.
 After law enforcement officers in Washington reported that high percentages of their identity theft cases involved methamphetamine, including 100 percent in Spokane County, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, proposed a bill to study the connection.
 Richard Rawson, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been studying methamphetamine since the 1980's, agrees that meth use is compatible with the kind of concentration needed to be an identity thief. 
 ''Crack users and heroin users are so disorganized and get in these frantic binges, they're not going to sit still and do anything in an organized way for very long,'' Dr. Rawson said. ''Meth users, on the other hand, that's all they have, is time. The drug stimulates the part of the brain that perseverates on things. So you get people perseverating on things, and if you sit down at a computer terminal you can go for hours and hours.''
 But Dr. Rawson said he had not seen a connection with identity theft in his research, and had not heard of one until law enforcement officials started bringing it up in conferences in the last year. 
 ''If it is a major event, it's a relatively new one,'' he said. ''How widespread it is, I don't know.''
 In Phoenix, which has the nation's highest rate of identity theft complaints, officials first became aware of the connection when laboratory raids uncovered stolen mail and checks that had been washed with acetone, a chemical used to make methamphetamine. 
 ''We thought for a while that that was the connection,'' said Todd C. Lawson, a state prosecutor who specializes in identity theft. ''But we learned there was much more to it.''
 Often identity theft rings organize like meth labs, where one person has the technical skills and others gather the raw materials. In an identity theft ring, one person might work the computer and the others steal identities or use the fraudulent checks or credit cards to get cash. 
 In Minnesota, meth laboratories and users developed a barter economy of washed checks, stolen checkbooks, drugs, ingredients and equipment, said Carol Falkowski, a spokeswoman for Hazelden, a drug treatment center in Center City. 
 In rural parts of Salt Lake County, Utah, meth addicts take their stolen identities onto the Internet because it has more targets than the local area, said Pat Fleming, director of county substance abuse services. ''Meth is one of the major things driving identity theft in Utah,'' Mr. Fleming said.
 Cocaine and heroin bypassed these areas because importers took the drugs directly to Salt Lake City, where addicts commit different crimes to pay for them. 
 For D., a 22-year-old woman inMissoula, Mont., meth and identity theft just came together.
 ''It's always suggested if you're around people that are high,'' she said, agreeing to be identified only by her first initial because she said she was afraid of a past associate. ''They know that this is an easy way to get money. That's the only way we ever found out about it, here anyway.''
 With advice from a fellow user, D. and her husband at the time stole a checkbook and wrote $5,600 worth of checks, using the money to buy drugs, gamble at Montana casinos and pay for hotel rooms, where she stayed up all night doing crossword puzzles. She never considered more traditional forms of crime, she said. 
 ''Going and stealing money from people is too risky,'' D. said. ''With this, I was sitting in my car at a bank, I could drive away if I wanted to. That's the only way I would have ever considered because I felt it was more safe. Now I think it was the stupidest thing I've ever done.''
 She was caught, finally, when she misspelled the signature of one of her victims. 
 For Ms. Carroll, the end came when one of her accomplices took an identity out of Ms. Carroll's trash and tried to use it. Ms. Carroll discarded identities every few days to avoid detection. When the police arrested her, the accomplice pointed them to Ms. Carroll.
 Ms. Carroll said she had not used methamphetamine since Jan. 7, 2003. She has also regained custody of her three children, who were placed in foster care after her arrest; a fourth, an infant at the time, was adopted.
 Ms. Carroll said she planned to start college in August. 
 ''I still see people put the little red flags up on their mailboxes when they're mailing their bills,'' she said. ''It amazes me. They still put their checks in their own mailboxes, and that was one of the biggest things we did was watch for red flags on mailboxes. You're sending your electricity bill, you have a check in there, that's all the information we needed.''
 People underestimate the resourcefulness of thieves, she said.
 ''Five days a week we did it,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''It was like a job.''

HEADLINE: Missile Tests Divide Seoul From Tokyo

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 10 

 BODY:
Soon after North Korea started launching missiles before dawn last Wednesday, Japan's television networks canceled their regular programming to broadcast the news and the government's quick response.
 By contrast, except for very brief ''news flashes,'' the networks here continued their World Cup soccer coverage until Italy beat Germany about 6:40 a.m.
The differences did not end there. Even as Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, crisscrossed this region emphasizing the importance of speaking with one voice against North Korea's missile tests, South Korea and Japan, America's allies, were bickering. 
 On Sunday, the South Korean president's office issued a statement saying that overreacting to the tests would only heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula. ''There is no reason to fuss over this from the break of dawn like Japan,'' it read.
 On Monday, Japanese officials called South Korea's comments regrettable and said Tokyo was not ''creating a big fuss.'' 
 The launchings have underscored how much the North Korea issue has transformed South Korea and Japan in recent years and set them heading in opposite directions, making it harder for Washington to achieve foreign policy goals like United Nations sanctions against the North. As South Korea has engaged North Korea and begun reconciliation, the process has reshaped its image of the North and complicated its relationship with the United States. 
 Japan, which began shaking off its postwar pacifism after North Korea fired a long-range missile over its territory in 1998, has led the campaign to punish it for last week's missile tests. In the last two days, Japanese officials have openly begun talking about whether Japan should acquire the military capacity to make pre-emptive strikes.
 ''South Korea is minimizing the threat, to manage the hawkish reaction from the United States and Japan,'' said Lee Geun, a professor of international relations at Seoul National University who is a visiting professor at Kyushu University in Japan. ''Japan is exaggerating the threat in order to pursue the goals of strengthening its self-defense forces and the U.S.-Japan alliance.''
 To a great extent, though, the South's insouciance about the North's threat is the product of years of peaceful relations. As in 1994, when North Korea threatened to turn Seoul into a ''sea of fire,'' trouble with their northern cousins used to send South Koreans scurrying to buy up bottled water and instant noodles.
 But since last Wednesday retailers have reported no hoarding, no spike in sales of instant noodles. 
 Consider the two young South Koreans who were sitting outside on a bench here. Asked about their reaction four days after the launchings, Chun Kwon Mi, 27, and Kim Chung Nam, 30, responded with blank stares. ''They fired?'' said Ms. Chun, who works in online shopping and does not follow the news.
 Mr. Kim, a construction worker, had not heard about the missiles either. ''We never talked about it at work,'' he said.
 Reconciliation with the North began in earnest in 2000 after Kim Dae Jung, then South Korea's president, and Kim Jong Il, the North's leader, held a historic meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital. 
 Since then, under its current president, Roh Moo Hyun, South Korea has pursued a policy of engaging -- or coddling, critics say -- the North. The South is now the North's second-biggest trading partner and aid donor, behind China, and thousands of South Koreans travel to the North each month for tourism, business and a multitude of exchanges.
 North Koreans are now regarded by Southerners as long-lost brethren, objects of pity or targets of ridicule -- but rarely enemies. ''They weren't firing at us,'' said Nam Chul, 44, a welder. ''They were firing at the United States and Japan. For North Korea this is almost like their own home, so why should they fire at us?''
 Older South Koreans tend to be more distrustful of the North, but their fear, too, has decreased.
 ''In general we've become too relaxed toward North Korea,'' said Kang Min Chung, who was waiting for a bus. Nevertheless, Ms. Kang supports engaging the North. ''But because my generation went through the Korean War, I'd still like to stay close to the United States,'' she said.
 South Korea's policy has created friction with the Bush administration, which prefers to try to isolate the North and force its government to collapse. Experts say North Korea is likely to become a long-term strain in the Washington-Seoul alliance, because a consensus has formed here that conflict should be avoided at all costs and that the only sure disaster would be the North's collapse. 
 Park Jin, a lawmaker in the opposition Grand National Party, said his party favored a ''more balanced'' version of the engagement policy, which he termed ''necessary not only for cooperation with North Korea, but also to try to make it reform.'' 
 Washington's opposition to engagement has stirred anti-American feelings here and a belief among some that the United States is standing in the way of reconciliation and eventual reunification.
 ''North Korea is an independent country, so why shouldn't they be able to fire missiles?'' said Kim Yung Reoul, 36, a pastor. ''It's remarkable -- they've confronted the United States. I felt quite satisfied. I felt as if I'd finally digested something that I had trouble digesting.''
 Mr. Hill, the American diplomat, said he understood why South Korea's reaction to the missile tests had been muted. ''The Chinese talk about their century of shame,'' he said in an interview here. ''In the case of South Korea you have this brutal division.''
 South Korea's ''whole North policy is predicated on some sort of long-term notion that somewhere through these sets of evolutionary policies that this will eventually get better,'' Mr. Hill said. ''Then this period of great tragedy can be put behind them. So when you have these moments that argue for the opposite, it's just upsetting for people. And we just need to be aware of that.''

To the Editor:
 In ''Maine Struggling to Revive Ailing Economy'' (news article, June 29), you report that a senior policy adviser to Gov. John Baldacci views a promising trend: ''middle-age professionals moving to Maine for the scenic setting and low cost of living, while commuting or telecommuting to jobs in other states.'' 
 But Maine may not be able to count on interstate telecommuting to boost economic activity at home. New York and some other states to which Maine residents may telecommute have a tax rule (the ''convenience of the employer'' rule) that penalizes nonresidents who telecommute to in-state employers.
Under New York's rule, for example, if a nonresident telecommutes some or most of the time to a New York employer, he may owe New York taxes not only on the income he earns on the days he works in New York, but also on the income he earns while working from his home outside New York. 
 Because the telecommuter's home state may also tax that income, the nonresident may be double taxed for working from home. 
 There is proposed federal legislation that would solve the problem, effectively eliminating the ''convenience of the employer'' rule. If Maine plans to rely on telework as an economic development tool, it should urge its representatives in Congress to support this bill.

HEADLINE: Booker Has 100-Day Plan For Newark's Reorganization

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 10 

 BODY:
Mayor Cory A. Booker outlined an ambitious set of goals on Monday for his first hundred days in office that included reorganizing city government in Newark to help families, improving citizen access to services and refurbishing or replacing some of the city's nearly century-old police stations.
 He also said he would focus attention on helping former convicts get jobs -- a concern he said had come up frequently in conversations with voters. Mr. Booker could not put an immediate price tag on his proposals or describe how the financially strapped city would pay for them. But he said many of his plans could be accomplished by reorganizing the city's agencies and refocusing their priorities. 
He said his plans grew out of hours of discussions and meetings in living rooms and kitchens with citizens, community groups, nonprofit social agencies and foundations. The ideas, he said, reflected his hope of creating a more inclusive government that would encourage a burst of what he called ''community activism.''
 ''I fully expect in 100 days people will begin to form their conclusions about this administration,'' Mr. Booker said, inviting city residents to hold him and the nine-member Municipal Council elected on his slate accountable. ''If we don't in this period begin to earn their respect, then we will have problems.''
 Mr. Booker took office on July 1, replacing Sharpe James, who chose not to run again after 20 years as mayor.
 One of Mr. Booker's biggest supporters, Mildred C. Crump, the council president, conceded that the social initiatives that dominate Mr. Booker's agenda harked back to some of the idealism of the 1960's.
 ''It is a kind of back-to-the-future approach, a kinder and gentler political statement,'' she said. ''And yes, it makes a difference if the state and federal government are hatcheting away things that help people. What we are doing is lofty, and people don't expect loftiness from Newark. But we have that capacity.''
 Clement A. Price, a history professor at Rutgers University's Newark campus and an expert on Newark and other urban areas in New Jersey, said that Mr. Booker's agenda ''absolutely challenges the conservative shift generally in the country.'' But he added that most urban reform efforts that have been all but forgotten were similarly ''lofty and idealistic.''
 ''My only worry is whether he can pull it off in this time frame and what the reaction will be if he does not,'' Professor Price said of the 100-day theme.
 The broad areas Mr. Booker focused his proposals on were public safety, economic empowerment, the nurturing of children, families and senior citizens, and government reform. 
 One initiative that touched on all of those themes was his plan to assist former convicts in getting jobs. Mr. Booker noted that this concern had come up frequently in his talks with residents and in meetings with the New Jersey Social Justice Institute.
 He said he would create the post of prisoner re-entry coordinator in his administration to make sure former convicts benefit from jobs created by economic development and to work to eliminate background checks for city jobs where such checks are not necessary.
 Amy L. Solomon, a senior researcher with the Urban Institute's Justice Policy Center, said it was exciting to have a policy speech by a big-city mayor promoting concerns about former convicts re-entering society.
 ''People are coming out of prisons and going back to a small number of neighborhoods that are highly disadvantaged,'' she said, noting also that there had been cutbacks in education and training programs for former inmates.
 Mr. Booker said his administration and the Municipal Council would also embrace many open government and election reforms put forward by a New Jersey Common Cause project on civic empowerment. Among them is a monthly opportunity for citizens to meet with the mayor and tighter ethics rules for city officials and employees.
 The mayor of New Jersey's largest city also promised to reorganize government to create a Department of Family and Child Well-Being to better coordinate city and state services and private agencies that support families.
 In addition to his already announced initiatives to put more police on patrol and focus on stemming youth gang activity, he said that at the end of the first 100 days, he would announce a capital improvement program to get new equipment and station houses for the police.

HEADLINE: Borrowing Rises as Credit Card Use Jumps 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Borrowing by consumers rose in May for the seventh consecutive month as credit card and other types of revolving debt jumped by the most since October 2004, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. 
 Consumer credit, or nonmortgage loans to individuals, rose $4.4 billion, or 2.5 percent at an annual rate, to $2.174 trillion.
The figures suggest that Americans are using their credit cards to finance more purchases as rising interest rates and slowing increases in real estate values discourage borrowing against home equity.
 ''Extracting the untapped value of one's home is more expensive and may be downright risky if the housing market continues to cool,'' said Chris Rupkey, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. 
 Revolving debt, which includes credit cards, rose $6.7 billion for the month, a 9.9 percent gain at an annual rate. Nonrevolving debt, which includes car loans and mobile home loans, fell $2.2 billion for the month.
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that inventories at wholesalers rose 0.8 percent in May, led by gains in business equipment and machinery and a jump in petroleum stockpiles.

HEADLINE: Even Statelessness Goes Better With Coke. Or Does It?

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia 

 BODY:
When a Coca-Cola bottling plant opened here two years ago, the 400-plus investors invited to finance the project were carefully chosen by clan.
 There were Abgal investors and Habar Gedir investors, and representatives of other clans around Somalia as well. All kicked in a minimum of $300 to help start the United Bottling Company, Somalia's only Coca-Cola maker. It was a deliberate effort to create a feeling of communal ownership for the factory in a place where clan-based conflict has long been the rule.
It was a bold business venture, building a sparkling, $8.3 million facility in such a tumultuous capital. The thinking was that Somalia had huge business potential and that the anarchy that erupted after its last government collapsed in 1991 would give way to economic recovery. 
 But Somalia is a difficult place to read, and now, two years after the plant went up, the Coke brand faces a much changed business environment, one with both opportunity and peril. Islamic militias took over the capital in June and brought stability to the city, so much so that the Coke bottler here predicts its sky-high security costs will soon plummet.
 ''Before, we had gunmen accompanying our distributors,'' Mohammed Hassan Awale, the sales manager and acting general manager of the plant, said in an interview. ''Now, no guns are needed.''
 There is another benefit to peace, he said. ''If there is peace, there is opportunity for work, for business, and people will have money to buy Coke,'' he said.
 The new political reality in Mogadishu has also taken a bite out of business, as some imams have begun railing against Coke, calling it an un-Islamic beverage that should not go down a proper Muslim's throat.
 Nur Barud Gurhan, a hard-line sheik in Mogadishu, raised the issue in January during a protest against cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that were published first in Denmark and then in other countries. He declared that Westerners were enemies of Islam and that their products, anything from milk that originates in Denmark to Atlanta's most famous carbonated export, should not be consumed by Somalis.
 The anti-Coke campaign was picked up by members of the Islamic courts who took over Mogadishu. They defeated the secular warlords who long controlled the country, and who received American financial support in recent years for their efforts to root out terrorists.
 Using Washington's support for the warlords as a rallying cry, the Islamic militias have also railed against Coke, spreading a message in mosques that has already prompted many to abstain.
 ''I was selling Coca-Cola before the U.S. government formed the devil's alliance with the warlords,'' said Hilowle Yarow Hassan, a restaurant owner. He has since stopped selling Coke.
 Omar Hussein Omar, who owns a tea shop in the capital, used to sell Coke as well but was persuaded by religious leaders to give it up. ''Out of ignorance, I was selling and drinking Coca-Cola, but now I hate it so much,'' he said, indicating that he has no desire to help his enemies in the West profit, even if some of his countrymen are involved in the local Coke enterprise.
 ''If I had the power, I would destroy the Coke plant in Mogadishu because they are generating hard currency for our worst enemy,'' said another Coke detractor, Talha Kheyr Abdulla, an English teacher.
 The Coke plant was quiet on a recent morning. Mr. Awale offered a bottle of ice-cold Coke to a visitor, but acknowledged that production, which can exceed 30,000 bottles an hour, had been temporarily suspended. He blamed not anti-Americanism but the relatively cool weather last month, which had reduced sales and prompted a slowdown in the production of Coke, as well as that of Fanta and Sprite.
 In his view, most Somalis are not anti-American and enjoy Coke as much as others around the world, though he conceded that Washington's alliance with the warlords had provoked much anti-American sentiment. ''The people do not hate the U.S.,'' he said. ''They hate what the U.S. did.''
 Coke was bottled in Mogadishu in the 1980's, when Somalia was still one country, but that plant has long been in ruins. The ramshackle walls are still painted a faded red, but inside, where all the machinery used to be, are now thousands of squatters, most too poor to afford a luxury like Coke.
 Before the new plant went up in July 2004, Coke still found its way into Somalia, by ship from the United Arab Emirates. It cost about 8,000 Somali shillings a bottle back then, or about 60 cents, a significant sum in a place where jobs are scarce and most struggle to eke out a living. The modern production facility has reduced the price to about a third of that, company officials here say.
 That is good news for Coke drinkers like Abdulahi Adan Abdurahman, 31, who ignores religious leaders' calls for him to stay away from it. ''I love Coca-Cola,'' he said. ''I drink it all the time. It's my favorite drink.''
 Hussein Moalim Ali, 22, a student, agrees, advocating a philosophy not unlike the one put forward by Coke's many investors.
 ''I don't have suspicions about it,'' he said of his favorite beverage. ''I don't think hostility can work in business. Business must be free from political or religious affairs.''

HEADLINE: Another Mission 'Accomplished'

 BODY:
The release of the White House midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets, not by a full-dress presidential dog-and-pony show. But President Bush plans to preside today, with members of Congress and invited guests in attendance. By all indications, including his own in his weekly radio address last Saturday, he plans to turn this into a celebration -- just in time for the fall campaign. 
 This is proof, if anyone still needs it, that this administration is desperate for something to boast about. On Mr. Bush's watch, triple-digit budget surpluses have turned into annual triple-digit budget deficits. There's no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact. Yes, the report is expected to project that this year's deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last year's -- probably somewhere between $280 billion and $300 billion, versus a $318 billion shortfall in 2005. That's not much to crow about.
But Mr. Bush is likely to gloat, anyway. Earlier this year, the administration conveniently projected a highly inflated deficit of $423 billion. With that as a starting point, the actual results can be spun to look as if they're worth cheering. 
 The razzle-dazzle won't end there. As he did in his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Bush is sure to use today's event to credit tax cuts for a projected ''surge'' in tax revenue. The Treasury is expected to take in about $250 billion more in 2006 than in 2005, for a total take of $2.4 trillion. Devoid of context, the number looks impressive. 
 In fact, it is $100 billion less than the $2.5 trillion revenue estimate the administration touted when it set out in 2001 to sell its policy of never-ending tax cuts. Even with this year's bigger haul, real revenue growth during the Bush years will be abysmal, averaging about 0.3 percent per capita, versus an average of nearly 10 percent in all previous post-World War II business cycles. That might be excusable if the recent revenue improvements could reasonably be expected to continue. They cannot. Much of the increase in tax receipts is from corporate profits, high-income investors and super high-earning executives, sources that are just as unpredictable as the financial markets to which they're inevitably linked. 
 So, the revenue surge is neither a sign that the tax cuts are working nor of sustainable economic growth. A growing number of economists, most prominently from the Congressional Budget Office, point out that upsurges in revenue are also the result of growing income inequality in the United States, an observation that is consistent with mounting evidence of a rapidly widening gap between the rich and everyone else. As corporations and high-income Americans claim ever more of the economic pie, revenues rise, even if there's no increase in overall economic growth. 
 If Mr. Bush looked behind his headline numbers, he, too, could see that the rich are getting richer while the rest are, at best, only holding ground. It would make sense to use some of the windfall revenue to enact policies and programs that tilt against growing inequality. Unfortunately, he's flogging more tax cuts that will deepen the divide.

HEADLINE: Hewlett-Packard Slows Pace After Fast Start in Consulting

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Hewlett-Packard made a splashy entrance into the big leagues of business consulting when it landed a $3 billion outsourcing contract in 2003 to run all of Procter & Gamble's information technology.
 But it has not made many waves since Mark V. Hurd became the chief executive more than a year ago.
''It was like the dog who finally caught the bus,'' said Julie Giera, a vice president with Forrester Research who tracks the information technology consulting business. ''Now what?''
 For the last half year, HP Services, the company's $16 billion consulting and services business, has answered that question with declining revenue. The division has been one of the company's few laggards, while the divisions that sell printers and computers have reported strong increases in revenue and profit. 
 The reason for the slowdown, said Steve Smith, the company's senior vice president for services, is pretty simple and totally intentional. ''All the Tinkertoys we had in the company were not being leveraged,'' he said. 
 Mr. Hurd told Mr. Smith and his lieutenants to throttle back growth until they could start bringing in more profitable revenue. How they are doing that says a lot about how Mr. Hurd is changing the giant technology company and how he intends to get more growth out of it. 
 Mr. Hurd wants Hewlett-Packard, which reported $86.7 billion in revenue last year but only $2.4 billion in net profit, to grow three ways, which it can do even faster with the help of the company's business consultants. 
 First, he wants Hewlett-Packard to sell more notebook and hand-held computers to corporate customers. That is an easy one for its team of consultants, who analyze how a customer uses technology and how Hewlett-Packard could potentially improve things.
 Second, he wants to sell more printers and printing services. The imaging and printing division has been doing well in those areas as it extends Hewlett-Packard's reach into copiers and commercial printing. 
 The company could sell even more by winning contracts to manage a company's printing just as it manages computers or data storage. Because printing is distributed around a workplace, the costs are huge, hidden and largely unmanaged. Companies spend as much as 3 percent of their revenue on printing, faxing and imaging, said Hewlett-Packard executives, but rarely realize that they are doing so. 
 In this new area, Hewlett-Packard faces Xerox, a reborn and strong competitor, and Dell, its longtime rival in the PC business, which recently won a major printing services contract from Boeing.
 Mr. Hurd's third engine of growth is a new one: the next-generation data center. It is a computer room running with few workers because Hewlett-Packard software on the company's machines automates most of the process. The company's consultants would design, sell and run these centers. 
 The clients would save money because the data centers are efficient, using less power and fewer people, Hewlett-Packard says. And it is betting that those companies will spend some of their savings on new equipment -- like the computers, servers, storage devices and printers that it makes. 
 For all this to work, it needs to win invitations from major companies to fix their technology infrastructure. It has to get bigger or act bigger. Hewlett-Packard's services business is in fourth place, behind I.B.M., which has revenue of $46.4 billion; Electronic Data Systems, with $20.1 billion; and Accenture, with $16.1 billion. 
 The ranking inflates Hewlett-Packard's strength because it includes what are called ''break-fix'' deals -- maintaining equipment and running help desks. The company does well in that segment, but lags where the high-profit revenue is made, in consulting and outsourcing.
 Pulling out all the stops to win the Procter & Gamble contract made sense for HP Services. ''They aren't that big, and they struggled to put themselves on the map,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., a senior research analyst who follows Hewlett-Packard for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
 It got on the map, but at what price? ''Big deals are hard to manage,'' Mr. Sacconaghi said, and digesting a large number of deals can hurt earnings. ''They were overly aggressive on the top-line growth at the expense of profitability.''
 Company executives would not discuss the profitability of individual deals, though they pointed out that multiyear contracts were rarely profitable in the early stages as the vendor learned where the problems were and invented solutions. 
 Ann M. Livermore, the executive vice president for Technology Solutions Group, which includes HP Services, said, ''I would absolutely do that deal again.'' 
 Procter & Gamble said it was going well. ''We've had our challenges,'' said Linda Clement-Holmes, the company's general manager of infrastructure services and governance. ''We suspected we would. It's been a learning curve for both of us.'' (One result of the relationship: P.& G. puts printing on its Pringles potato chips with Hewlett-Packard's printing technology.)
 Ms. Livermore says she thinks the unit is on the right track. ''While we are not satisfied with the performance of our unit, we are satisfied with the progress,'' she said. ''The challenge is how to price the projects to win them and still generate returns.''
 Rather than chasing everything, Ms. Livermore and Mr. Smith are looking at smaller deals. That allows HP Services to use the skills it has setting up data centers around the world and automating the management of software used by its clients. It is focusing on global companies doing business in Asia, where analysts estimate the services division already has about a third of its personnel. That way, the company estimates, as it adds another dollar of new business, it does not have to add 60 cents of cost, but maybe 30 cents or 40 cents. 
 The mistake the company made, Mr. Smith said, was in taking on too many large, unique projects. ''To get cost-efficient, we have to do 75 percent standard and 25 percent custom,'' said Mr. Smith, a former executive at Electronic Data Systems. ''Before, we were doing too many one-offs. We wanted to slow it down.''
 HP Services focused on technology infrastructure, data centers, printing and business processes for finance and administration. When customers complained that they were seeing too many Hewlett-Packard sales representatives and consultants, the company made sure a designated team made the visits each time. 
 Focusing on the smaller deals could be a winning strategy. The research firm IDC estimates that consultants will be bidding on $127 billion in large information technology deals in 2007 and 2008. Unlike the first generation of outsourcing and consulting contracts, these will most likely be shared by a number of vendors as the companies try to maintain the balance of power. 
 One recent example of this trend was the contracts awarded by General Motors in February. Over all, the contract was large, $5.1 billion. E.D.S., the incumbent, retained 85 percent of its business, but Hewlett-Packard got $700 million for networking G.M. dealers and providing technology for the product development and manufacturing quality operations.
 ''We are really pleased with what we got,'' Ms. Livermore said. ''We like when it is segmented.'' 
 Ms. Livermore said she was looking for revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent a year for HP Services, and operating profit of 8 percent to 10 percent. While revenue for the unit was down in the quarter that ended April 30, the operating profit margin almost hit 9 percent as profits rose 18 percent. 
 For now, analysts are waiting to see the result of Hewlett's changes. ''We see HP Services clearly as a work in progress,'' said Robert Welch, an industry analyst at IDC. ''I don't see the roster of players shifting at the top, and I don't see anyone dropping off the list.'' 
 Cindy Shaw, a securities analyst with Moors & Cabot, said: ''They need to keep doing what they are doing. They have the right plan.''

HEADLINE: Google to Put a Research Center in Michigan 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and NICK BUNKLEY; Micheline Maynard reported from Ann Arbor, Mich., for this article and Nick Bunkley from Detroit.

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 10 

 BODY:
Google plans to build an office and research center here that will have up to 1,000 employees, people who had been briefed on the plan said Monday night.
 The announcement is set to be made Tuesday morning by Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm at a news conference at the state Capitol in Lansing. 
Google is expected to open the center in downtown Ann Arbor, the hometown of the University of Michigan, where Larry Page, one of Google's founders, earned his undergraduate degree in engineering. 
 Mr. Page, a Michigan native, has maintained close ties with the university; his company is in the midst of a project to digitize all seven million volumes in the university's libraries.
 Google has been scouting the city for up to 240,000 square feet of office space, according to a report last year in The Ann Arbor Business Review. Ann Arbor was among a handful of potential cities chosen from an initial list of 50, the report said.
 Most of the space would be used for a technology and call center, with about 40,000 square feet needed to house the library digitization project, which has been hindered by court challenges over copyrights. 
 A Google spokesman did not return calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for the governor declined to comment.
 The investment is a much-needed boost for Ms. Granholm, the state's Democratic governor, who is in a tough re-election race. She was criticized last month when Michigan did not actively compete for a Honda plant that will be built in Indiana. 
 She has also been lobbying hard to have a Toyota engine plant opened in the state, but a decision on that factory may not come until after the November election, people participating in the discussions on that factory said.
 Michigan has lost nearly 300,000 jobs since 2000, and its jobless rate has been higher than the national average for 57 consecutive months. Southeast Michigan, where numerous auto plants have closed, is trying to shed its Rust Belt image and market itself as a technology hub in an effort to make up for some job losses.
 Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., has been on an investment spree. It is spending $1.5 billion this year on operations centers and on custom technology.

HEADLINE: China Posts A Surplus Sure to Stir U.S. Alarm

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 10 

 BODY:
China reported a record trade surplus with the rest of the world on Monday, one of the largest monthly trade imbalances any country has ever recorded and one that is likely to heighten trade tensions, particularly with the United States and Europe.
 The government said that the surplus in June reached $14.5 billion, a record for the second month in a row, eclipsing each of the giant surpluses recorded by Japan in the last few decades. 
China's results were released on the day that Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, was sworn in as the American secretary of the Treasury, a bit of timing that underscored the challenge Mr. Paulson faces. Because he played a pivotal role in expanding Goldman Sachs's China business, traveling there frequently in the last few years, Secretary Paulson is expected to use his influence to coax Chinese officials into taking steps to close the trade gap between the two countries. 
 Officials in Beijing said that in June, exports soared 23 percent, to $81.3 billion, while imports rose 18.9 percent, to $66.8 billion.
 Economists say the huge surplus is likely to compel officials in the United States and Europe to increase pressure on the Chinese government to allow its currency, the yuan, to appreciate against the dollar and other currencies as a way of reducing the trade deficits.
 Some economists also warn that China's growing trade dominance creates significant imbalances in the global economy. Already this year, China overtook Japan to hold the world's largest foreign currency reserves, now about $875 billion, and is on track to reach reserves of $1 trillion by the end of the year. That figure would represent nearly half of China's gross domestic product.
 While placing a great deal of the global surplus and credit in the hands of China, the global imbalance also helps to saddle the United States with much of the world's debt, creating a lopsided economic relationship that can be destabilizing, particularly to currency exchange rates.
 If such imbalances become more exaggerated, these economists argue, the dollar could slide further and the global economy could face a serious downturn.
 ''This is a significant number,'' Dong Tao, an economist who specializes in Asian countries other than Japan at Credit Suisse, said of the monthly trade imbalance. ''We're expecting a trade surplus in China of $130 billion this year and a current-account surplus of $200 billion. This is unprecedented.'' The current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, includes changes in interest payments.
 China has taken some steps to narrow the deficits. Last year, it allowed its currency to appreciate modestly, and promised to gradually allow more gains, though those have been small so far.
 Today, the yuan trades at about 7.99 to the dollar, up from its longstanding peg around 8.27 to the dollar before 2005.
 The Chinese government is also encouraging consumers to spend more money at home, hoping that the domestic economy will pull in more imports. But as imports have been rising over the last year, exports have climbed at remarkable rates, even after years of double-digit gains.
 In May, China reported a $13 billion surplus, surprising many analysts who say that the biggest surpluses for China typically come near the end of the year. And in June, many analysts were forecasting a $13 billion surplus, $1.5 billion less than Monday's figure, which is a record in recent global trade history according to statistics by Global Trade Information Services, based in Columbia, S.C.
 So far this year, China's surplus with the rest of the world has risen to about $61.5 billion, up 55 percent from a year earlier and on pace to surpass last year's record of $102 billion.
 ''This is sure to increase the trade war between the U.S., Europe and China,'' said Chen Jianan, a professor of economics at Fudan University in Shanghai.
 And China has other problems on its hands. The government has been trying to gently cool down a sizzling economy that grew about 10 percent in the first half of this year, according to official statistics. 
 In recent months, Beijing has raised interest rates, announced administrative measures to rein in the real estate market, and tried to curb bank lending -- all aimed at tempering growth and inflationary pressures.
 Yet economic activity still seems frenetic -- with Chinese still opening factories, building roads, constructing housing developments, malls and even new cities, particularly in advance of 2008, when Beijing will be host to the Summer Olympics and draw attention to the country.
 And money is flowing into the country at an unprecedented pace. China now has the world's fourth-largest economy, surpassing Britain last year. 
 Stephen Green, an economist at the Standard Chartered Bank, said that though the new trade surplus was likely to increase pressure on the government to allow its currency to appreciate further, he did not expect any sharp move. 
 Mr. Tao, the Credit Suisse economist, who uses the Western form of his name, said that a revaluation might be meaningless because the real problem was that American consumers were eager to buy low-cost Chinese goods but that the United States did not have much in return to offer China.
 ''The U.S. has little to sell back to China but Boeing and beef,'' he said. ''And this is something China and the U.S. realize.''
 Still, he said that the imbalance was a matter of serious concern for the global economy, adding, ''A $200 billion current-account surplus is something problematic for the rest of the world.''
 Despite its economic advances, China faces significant challenges. If it allows its currency to appreciate, many domestic producers will be squeezed and some companies may move factories to other parts of Asia or elsewhere. 
 And if China does not act, pressure could mount from outside, possibly to the point of some sort of sanctions.
 Analysts say that if no major steps are taken to reverse the trend in trade, the global economy will continue to expand in lopsided fashion, forcing a showdown over credit or interest rates, because these days, Asians are essentially lending the United States the cheap money to purchase Asian goods.

HEADLINE: Paulson, Taking Treasury Post, Emphasizes Global Issues 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
Henry M. Paulson Jr. took over on Monday as Treasury secretary and as President Bush's top economic adviser, filling out a new economic team with a more pragmatic cast for the final two and a half years of this administration.
 Mr. Bush, who wooed Mr. Paulson from his post as chairman of Goldman Sachs, said on Monday that the former executive would have a central role in setting the agenda and implied that the Treasury Department would regain some of the power it lost to White House advisers during Mr. Bush's first term. 
 ''Hank Paulson will be my leading policy adviser on a broad range of domestic and international economic issues, and he will be my principal spokesman for my administration's economic policies,'' Mr. Bush said before Mr. Paulson was sworn in.
 Mr. Paulson, who has a net worth of more than $700 million and has announced plans to sell $470 million worth of Goldman Sachs stock, is probably the richest Treasury secretary in history.
 White House officials seemed intent on coordinating Mr. Paulson's arrival with a broader effort to generate more excitement for Mr. Bush's economic agenda and record.
 Administration officials are frustrated that Mr. Bush's popular support has plunged, mainly because of the war in Iraq, even as the economy has grown briskly and unemployment has remained comparatively low at 4.6 percent.
 On Tuesday, the administration plans to announce that this year's budget deficit will be lower than projected because tax revenues are climbing faster than expected.
 Last Friday, Mr. Bush visited a microelectronics factory near Chicago to highlight the nation's high-technology strength and the newest employment statistics.
 But Mr. Paulson will be taking over at a time when the economy appears to be slowing, inflation is rising and gasoline prices have climbed to nearly $3.20 a gallon in many regions.
 The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates 17 times in two years and is expected to increase them at least once more. The once-sizzling housing market has slowed noticeably, with prices edging down in some cities and homes remaining on the market much longer than in the recent past.
 Although Mr. Bush's economic policy, with its emphasis on tax cuts, deregulation and trade, has a distinct ideological cast, Mr. Paulson will be leading a new economic team that has an early reputation as more pragmatic than ideological. 
 Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, is a former Goldman executive who is trying to improve ties between the White House and Congress. Rob Portman, who recently took over as director of the Office of Management and Budget, served as Mr. Bush's chief trade negotiator and, before that, was a Republican representative from Ohio known for his expertise on pension and saving issues. 
 White House officials are hoping that Mr. Paulson can develop the kind of stature that was accorded to James A. Baker III under President Ronald Reagan, and Robert E. Rubin, another former chairman of Goldman Sachs, under President Bill Clinton. 
 To help guide him through an administration thick with existing relationships and rivalries, Mr. Paulson recruited James R. Wilkinson, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, as his chief of staff. Mr. Wilkinson has a reputation as a shrewd political adviser and one with a background in foreign policy as well.
 Before working under Ms. Rice, Mr. Wilkinson was a communications strategist at the National Security Council and, before that, communications director for the United States Central Command during the first year of the war in Iraq.
 Mr. Paulson suggested that his top priorities would be international issues; he said little about major domestic initiatives. His most forceful remarks were about the need to promote a greater engagement in the world economy.
 ''We must always remember that the strength of the U.S. economy is linked to the strength of the global economy,'' he said after being sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts. ''If we retreat from the global stage, the void is likely to be filled by those who do not share our commitment to economic reform.''
 Mr. Paulson could have his hands full on the international front. With the trade deficit approaching $800 billion this year, the United States needs to attract more than $8 billion a day from foreign investors to pay for its current level of consumption.
 A loss of confidence in the dollar could aggravate inflation pressures by pushing up import prices. It could also push up long-term interest rates, which remain surprisingly low even though the Fed has pushed up overnight rates.
 Mr. Paulson's other challenge will be budget issues. Though tax revenues have increased sharply this year, spending continues to climb rapidly as a result of the war in Iraq, hurricane relief and the new Medicare prescription-drug program.
 Despite more than four years of economic growth, tax revenues have barely recovered to their level in 2000 and the deficit is still likely to be about $300 billion this year.
 Mr. Bush made it clear that he expected Mr. Paulson to help make his tax cuts permanent, which would cost more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
 ''Our first challenge is to keep taxes low,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Hank understands that cutting taxes has helped launch the strong economic expansion that is lifting the lives of millions of Americans.''
 Mr. Paulson was more demure.
 ''We need to pursue economic and regulatory policies that are responsive to today's world,'' he said. He did not mention tax cuts, one way or the other.

HEADLINE: The Dear Leader's Boiling Cauldron

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
There's no country in the world remotely like North Korea.
 Every home has a speaker on the wall to spout propaganda, everybody wears a button with a picture of the late ''Great Leader,'' the government counterfeits U.S. dollars, parents must hand over triplets for the state to raise, and Dear Leader Kim Jong Il rules less as a Communist than as a traditional Korean god-king.
North Korea possesses 5,000 tons of nerve gas, and possibly smallpox, as well as plutonium for nuclear weapons. So the latest flurry of concern about North Korea is overdue -- but misdirected. 
 North Korea's test of a long-range missile that could reach the U.S. was dramatic. But it didn't violate international law or disrupt the fundamental balance. An incomparably greater challenge is North Korea's stealthy production of plutonium.
 That is where President Bush's policy toward North Korea has failed dismally.
 First, a bit of history: North Korea may have obtained enough plutonium for one nuclear weapon by halting a reactor in 1989. It didn't obtain any more weapon-usable plutonium while President Clinton held office (although it did try to start a program to enrich uranium, which is less of an immediate concern).
 Then Mr. Bush's blustery refusal to negotiate led the Dear Leader to ramp up plutonium production, so today North Korea has enough plutonium for four to 13 nuclear weapons. David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security estimates that by mid-2008 it will have enough plutonium for eight to 17 weapons.
 So here's the scorecard: Weapon-usable plutonium produced under Mr. Clinton, none; weapon-usable plutonium produced under Mr. Bush, enough for at least several additional warheads. (As for the uranium, there's no indication that enough has been enriched for even one weapon.)
 Even more alarming for the long run, North Korea has resumed construction of a large reactor at Yongbyon and possibly one at Taechon as well. Satellite pictures suggest that progress has been slow, but the new Yongbyon reactor alone could eventually produce enough plutonium for 10 weapons annually.
 Finally, Mr. Bush's approach has bolstered the cowboys in North Korea while undermining moderates. 
 The Bush administration has been quietly critical of China for resisting sanctions on North Korea, but at least China and South Korea have a coherent strategy: soothe Kim Jong Il, encourage capitalist-style reforms, promote international exchanges and push North Korea down the path of moderation that China has blazed since the late 1970's. 
 President Clinton's approach to North Korea wasn't pretty but it did eventually stop both plutonium production and missile testing.
 The real missiles to worry about, by the way, aren't the intercontinental ones, which are unreliable and probably not capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. The most threatening are medium-range Nodong missiles, which probably could deliver nuclear warheads to Japanese cities -- killing hundreds of thousands of people and severely harming the world economy.
 Granted, the hardest job in the world is devising a North Korea policy; the easiest is to criticize one. Nonetheless, our present policy is failing so wretchedly that it's time to start afresh. 
 Escalating confrontation is a fool's game, because North Korea has more taste for brinksmanship than we do. It can hold a nuclear test, test a missile so that it ''accidentally'' lands near a Japanese port, send a few spy submarines to torpedo Asian stock markets, or trigger a financial panic by leaving a (sealed) suitcase of anthrax in the Tokyo subway.
 The only option we have is to negotiate seriously, both in the six-party talks and directly with the North. Mr. Bush has steadily adopted more pragmatic policies toward North Korea over the last five years, and briefly last fall when he entrusted his able envoy, Chris Hill, with real authority, the talks went surprisingly well. Then North Korea had a tantrum and the administration reined in Mr. Hill, and we're back in a crisis.
 Mr. Bush is absolutely right to raise North Korean counterfeiting and human rights abuses. But if we want to do more than huff and puff, those concerns must be part of an overall strategy to roll up our sleeves and engage North Korea, with our first priority a halt to plutonium production. It's time to hold our nose and negotiate directly.

HEADLINE: Why Not Take All Of Synge?

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
A hypothetical question. A weekday in New York dawns warm, clear, unseasonably dry. The necessity of work seems an affront, with the carefree enticements of a beautiful day in the city emitting signals of seduction. This is what God created sick days for, after all.
 Tempted to sin, do you choose to while away the afternoon gamboling through Central Park? Hop on a train to the beaches, blissfully free of weekend crowds? Zip out to Shea to exult in the company of the surging Mets for a day game?
Or do you enter a dark theater near Lincoln Center at 2 p.m., to emerge some eight and a half hours later, having spent the day and evening submerged in the little-known oeuvre of the Irish playwright J. M. Synge in its entirety?
 Don't all jump at once, guys: tickets are still available! 
 Passionate theater lovers will, I hope, have already made their plans to attend ''DruidSynge,'' the celebrated cycle of all six Synge plays created by Garry Hynes, the Tony Award-winning director of Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' among many other productions, and founder of the Druid Theater Company in Galway, Ireland. More than a quarter-century in development, first produced in its entirety last summer in Ireland, and an award winner at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival, ''DruidSynge'' is the theatrical centerpiece of this year's Lincoln Center Festival.
 For those benighted folks who would prefer to spend a glorious summer day outdoors, please read on. The beaches aren't going anywhere, Central Park is an eternal resource, and the Mets -- let us pray -- will be surging through the rest of the summer. But Ms. Hynes's magnificent journey through the dark, comic landscape of one of the less celebrated Irish literary masters will be around only for a couple of weeks, and it shouldn't be missed. (There are two weekend performances, this Sunday and next, for those morally opposed to shirking work.)
 Grandly entertaining and powerfully moving, ''DruidSynge'' is a major achievement for Ms. Hynes, her design collaborators and her superb 19-member acting company. Ranging across wide emotional territory without missing a beat, it brings alive a milieu that feels both intriguingly remote and utterly intimate, exotic in the eccentric syntax and unruly lyricism of its earthy dialogue -- God bless the Irish! -- but familiar in its consoling knowledge of the loneliness and despair that are the sorrowful scars of all humankind.
 Admittedly, the prospect seems daunting. Six plays in a single day? A writer's whole canon poured into the theatrical equivalent of a Super Big Gulp? But consider that Synge was an economical writer, unusually for the early years of the 20th century. (The name is pronounced ''sing,'' incidentally.) Half of the plays, all written from 1902 to 1909, when Synge died of cancer at just 37, are one-acts lasting a half-hour or so, and the cycle is generously leavened with breaks, including an hour and a half for dinner.
 Intimidated myself when I traveled to Dublin last summer, I initially saw the plays in three separate programs, before returning, at the friendly urging of Ms. Hynes, to see ''DruidSynge'' in a one-day immersion. She was right to persuade me: the cycle was designed to be experienced as a single entity, and is more powerful seen whole. The Lincoln Center Festival has wisely -- and bravely -- programmed it in full-day installments only.
 Among other advantages, seeing it complete affords you the opportunity to marvel at the nimble versatility and the remarkable endurance of the actors, some of whom have roles in most of the plays. I should start by mentioning the indispensable contributions of Marie Mullen -- the great and glorious Marie Mullen I can't resist calling her -- whom New York theatergoers will remember for her Tony-winning portrayal of the frustrated heroine of ''Beauty Queen.''
 Ms. Mullen appears in all but one play, and has major roles in most. Her forceful presence helps underscore Ms. Hynes's quiet emphasis on the centrality of women in Synge's oeuvre. Ms. Mullen is the dominant central character, the desperate mother Maurya, in the first play, the brief and wrenching ''Riders to the Sea.'' A stark depiction of grief in a form so pure and profound that it seems to sear the flesh, this haunting play stands apart from the rest of Synge's work, along with ''Deirdre of the Sorrows,'' which is performed last, for its absence of humor.
 In bookending the cycle this way, Ms. Hynes accentuates the essential darkness of Synge's vision of life, which may come as a surprise to theatergoers familiar with his best-known play (indeed, for most, his only known play), the savagely funny ''Playboy of the Western World.'' Ms. Hynes also stresses the continuity of Synge's themes by performing all the plays on a moody basic set by Francis O'Connor on which a pair of white boards -- destined to become a coffin in ''Riders'' -- remain quietly but portentously present, a potent symbol of the piteous but mundane inevitability of death.
 But if Synge never glossed over the most brutal truths of human experience -- the chief one being its inevitable extinguishing -- his mournful sensitivity to suffering was matched by an unapologetic delight in the life force that pulses in the veins of the tinkers, beggars and country people who shuffle or trudge or leap across the stage, expressing passionate loves and hates in some of the most gorgeous rustic language you'll ever hear onstage, language almost Shakespearean in its texture and vitality. (Don't fret if you lose some of the dialogue, as you surely will, given the idiomatic delivery of the actors and the imperfect acoustics of the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College; there's plenty more on the way.)
 Battered by want and the hard weather of Ireland, at the mercy of the brutal hearts of their fellow men, turning to the inevitable bottle for quick solace, Synge's characters somehow hold fast to visions of hope and glimpses of possible salvation. In the raucous comedy ''The Tinker's Wedding,'' a young woman (played with delicious spunk by Simone Kirby) is determined to get a ring from her man, but must battle the venality of a boozy priest and the rather more powerful opposition of her snarlingly irreverent would-be mother-in-law (Ms. Mullen, as riveting as a bawdy drunk as she was as the grief-choked Maurya only moments before). 
 In ''The Well of the Saints'' two blind beggars (Ms. Mullen and the terrific Eamon Morrissey) are miraculously cured by an itinerant preacher, only to emerge from their lonely isolation to see more fully the moral ugliness of the world around them.
 The sustaining necessity of illusion is also at the heart of ''Playboy,'' flawlessly performed here as the penultimate offering, with Aaron Monaghan inhabiting the role of the would-be parricide Christy Mahon with the same lively authority he brings to several other comic roles. Catherine Walsh is every bit his equal as a physically vigorous Pegeen Mike; Derry Power is side-splittingly funny as Pegeen's soused father; and Ms. Mullen gives what may be the most delicate and touching of her performances here as a sweetly lascivious but ultimately compassionate Widow Quin.
 After the intoxicating high of ''Playboy,'' it must be acknowledged that ''Deirdre of the Sorrows'' comes as a bit of a letdown and, to be entirely honest, a bit of a trial too. Written in a high-flown idiom that lacks the pungent humanity of the dialogue in the other plays, this story of a tragic love triangle in ancient Eire challenges Ms. Hynes's desire to present Synge's work as a wonderfully variegated but ultimately cohesive whole. Only with this archly poetic play does Ms. Hynes seem to be straining after effects, and perhaps for a big finish. (One could have done without the slightly mawkish final image of a young boy carrying onstage a portrait of Synge.)
 But it would be a shame -- make that a disgrace -- to leave before ''Deirdre,'' pleading fatigue or an early meeting. The plays are not performed with individual curtain calls. So only at the conclusion of the cycle do we have a chance to acknowledge the company's extraordinary work, the collective artistry that has brought to life this spellbinding pageant of fine words and savagery, to borrow Pegeen Mike's phraseology, which will sing in the hearts and minds of those who see it for a long time to come.

HEADLINE: Amateurs in All Their Glory, Imperfect and Proud

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Television is supposed to be the medium of the masses, but mostly it smoothes over the unsightly bulges of middle-class life. 
 ''America's Got Talent,'' an NBC knockoff of ''American Idol'' and one of the summer's biggest hits, is the main exception. If ''America's Got Talent'' is to be believed, the country actually doesn't have much. For every gifted juggler, gymnast or quick-change artist, there are dozens of badly deluded singers, dancers and contortionists. But over all, the contest is cheerful, vulgar and unembarrassed, a liberating belch in an increasingly proper and sleekly self-conscious television landscape.
 Nighttime dramas are especially fastidious. Whether the backdrop is a surgical ward on ''Grey's Anatomy,'' the damp jungle of ''Lost'' or a military base on ''The Unit,'' life is airbrushed and sound-adjusted. The brashly colored signposts of suburbia -- Arby's, Target, Bally fitness centers, drive-through banks, churches, vinyl swimming pools and powerwalkers in pastel tracksuits -- are washed out by tasteful, cinematic tones of sepia, gray and inky blue. Courtrooms, shopping centers and housing developments are so romanticized that the previews for the new fall season look like a vintage European art film. 
 Common-denominator sitcoms like ''Two and a Half Men'' on CBS tend to focus on the upper-middle class. (Casting the wonderful Holland Taylor is always a tell.) Newer ones like NBC's ''My Name Is Earl'' lovingly patronize trailer-park living. 
 The dwindling majority in between is edited out of prime time much in the way financial experts say the middle class is being squeezed out of the economy. Average people are visible on game shows or in the studio audience of ''Oprah'' and ''Ellen.'' Even commercials are reductionist: carmakers conjure empty, winding roads through the wilderness at dusk, and phone companies wittily mock the American family. Only the Publishers Clearing House winners look familiar. 
 ''America's Got Talent'' taps into summer aimlessness. On the eve of its sixth season, ''Idol'' has grown slickly professional. ''Talent'' is ''Idol'' with its stockings rolled down and belt loosened, something between amateur night at the Elks Lodge and the counselor's farewell roast at summer camp. Regis Philbin is the master of ceremonies, not Ryan Seacrest, and that is another liberation: Mr. Philbin has the right vaudeville touch and is funny without trying. Mr. Seacrest tries to be funny and isn't; his efforts to goad Mr. Cowell are as painful as a child's first bow strokes on the violin.
 David Hasselhoff (''Baywatch'') is a playful, ''Gong Show'' kind of judge, and so is the pop singer Brandy. The British judge, Piers Morgan, serves as a sneering stand-in for Mr. Cowell, who, not surprisingly, is the executive producer and mastermind of ''Talent.'' 
 Almost all the new reality contests include at least one British authority figure. ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' a Fox summer hit co-produced by Mr. Cowell's colleague Simon Fuller has two: Nigel Lythgoe as a superior-sounding judge, and Cat Deeley, a slim, blond British TV personality who has replaced Lauren Sanchez as the host and brings a brisk, no-nonsense tone to interviews with the rejected. In New York and Los Angeles magazine editors and film producers hire assistants with English accents to lend their offices a touch of class; on reality shows the British are there to heighten the coarseness of Middle America. 
 ''So You Think You Can Dance'' has a more limited range: only the young, fit and coordinated have a shot, and the dancing styles are almost as restrictively pop as the music choices on ''Idol.'' It's fun to watch, but it has a more limited range. The producers occasionally try to squeeze in a little humanity to the mix, including allowing a young woman from Highland, Mich., who said she had a spinal disorder, to perform her last tap dance as an audition. (CBS's ''Rock Star: Supernova'' is its own pierced and tattooed niche; Tommy Lee, a judge, says things like: ''It's crunch time, dude. Bring it on.'') 
 There are plenty of other competitions and talent shows. ''Treasure Hunters'' on NBC divides its contestants by family and also by caste: ''Southie Boys'' are neighborhood lads from South Boston, while ''Young Pros'' includes a law student, a medical student and a public relations consultant. (''Geniuses'' also are a team, as is ''Miss USA.'') 
 ''Master of Champions'' on ABC takes people with a skill and puts them in an absurd arena: a recent episode pitted two young drift-car drivers not against each other so much as against a wheel of cheese. They raced in tight circles around the cheese with a grater-tipped pole attached to the car, vying over who could whittle it down the most.
 There is less pressure on ''America's Got Talent,'' and the rejection is not as stinging. Even though it offers a $1 million prize, career opportunities for yodelers, harmonica players and jugglers are limited. The five seconds of fame is incentive enough: hoi polloi are heard, seen, applauded and jeered before a raucous, good-natured studio audience. Most of its members are peers, contestants waiting to be called down to the stage, Bob Barker-style. 
 The criteria for ''Talent'' are broad and vague enough to draw a wide range of contestants. Some, and that includes Bernie Barker, who claims to be the oldest living male stripper, look like eccentrics or undermedicated exhibitionists. But many others could be somebody's extroverted next-door neighbor. 
 Thirty years ago, prime time was ruled by the middle class, from ''Newhart'' and ''Happy Days'' to ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'' In today's era of hyper wealth and downward mobility, ''America's Got Talent'' is the place to see the nation unpolished and unchanged.

HEADLINE: Small Gains as Earnings Season Gets Off to Rough Start 

BYLINE: By Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks recouped earlier losses to end modestly higher yesterday as investors set aside concern over an uneasy start to the second-quarter earnings season, which included weak results from Alcoa and a sales warning at Lucent Technologies. 
 With no economic data scheduled, the market focused on the impact of higher interest rates and energy costs on corporate profits. Disappointments from Alcoa and Lucent dragged the major indexes sharply lower before they rebounded late in the session -- a sign that uncertain investors lacked information to drive stocks in one direction.
 ''When the question is how much economic growth is going to slow, people are going to wait and see how profit reports come in before they make new commitments,'' said Susan Malley of Malley Associates Capital Management. ''We're continuing to put money into the market, but not racing. In certain areas, we want to get as much information as we possibly can.'' 
 The Dow rose 31.22 points, or 0.28 percent, to 11,134.77, after tumbling as much as 75 points earlier. Broader stock indicators also reversed course to post moderate gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 5.18 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,272.52, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 11.93 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,128.86.
 Bonds rallied, with the price of the benchmark 10-year note rising 6/32, to 1006/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.10 percent, from 5.12 percent on Monday. 
 The uncertain trading yesterday came amid further evidence of Wall Street's confusion about the economy. Investors have become fearful that while rising interest rates are keeping inflation contained, they may be stunting economic growth and eating into corporate profits. Those worries were realized when Lucent, the diversified manufacturer 3M and the software maker EMC said their results would miss analysts' predictions.
 Analysts were nonetheless upbeat about second-quarter earnings given the anticipated slowdown in economic growth in the latter half of 2006.
 ''I think although earnings are going to be strong, they're going to grow at a slower rate than over the last six months,'' said Steve Neimeth, senior vice president at AIG SunAmerica. ''With interest rates and energy going higher and the consumer weakening, there may be risks to those higher estimates.''
 Rising oil prices added to the market's anxiety as energy traders monitored developments in talks with Iran over its nuclear arms program, and as they awaited the weekly update on United States reserves today. A barrel of light crude gained 55 cents, to $74.16, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The United States dollar slipped against the Japanese yen and was barely changed versus European currencies. Gold prices jumped to $641.45 an ounce.
 The aluminum producer Alcoa posted a 62 percent jump in quarterly profit, helped by soaring metal prices, but its revenue fell shy of estimates. Alcoa lost $1.63, to $31.78.
 The telecommunications equipment maker Lucent Technologies, which is being acquired by a French rival, Alcatel, said its income and sales for the June quarter would be less than analysts expected. Lucent dropped 15 cents, to $2.19, and Alcatel lost 59 cents, to $11.71.
 The Pepsi Bottling Group gained $1.61, to $33.96, after posting better-than-forecast earnings and revenue for the quarter and increasing its annual guidance. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price -- 99.626
High Rate -- 4.805
Coupon Yield -- 4.890
Low Rate -- 4.770
Median Rate -- 4.790
Total applied for -- $41,786,848

Noncompetitive -- $364,808

The four-week bills mature Aug. 10, 2006.

HEADLINE: U.S. Finance Pulls Biotech Across Seas 

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
When the Scottish economic development agency injected about $9 million into the biotechnology company Cyclacel last October, the country's enterprise minister explained that ''there could not be a more important company for Scotland's future.'' 
 But only two months later, this flag-bearer for Scottish biotechnology said it would move its headquarters to Short Hills, N.J., and merge with a publicly traded American company.
Cyclacel executives say there was no slight intended to Scotland. ''The issue was one of access to the capital markets of the United States,'' Spiro Rombotis, Cyclacel's chief executive, said in a recent interview. Only American investors, he said, could supply the tens of millions of dollars needed to carry the company's cancer drugs through clinical trials. 
 Cyclacel is not alone among European biotechnology companies that consider their science second to none, while conceding the superiority of American financial markets. From European countries including Denmark, France and Germany -- and from Australia and New Zealand, too -- a number of biotechnology companies have come to America, in name at least, for greater access to the world's largest investment pool for life sciences. Some also say the United States is a more lucrative market for the drugs they are developing. 
 The migration trend suggests that money, not molecules, could become the United States' main competitive advantage in biotechnology, a field that is potentially one of the 21st century's premier global industries. 
 Most of the migrating companies are setting up only small corporate and business offices in the United States, while leaving their scientists back in their home countries. Cyclacel's 65 researchers, for example, remain in Dundee, Scotland, and Cambridge, England, where they have strong ties to local academic communities. Salaries for scientists are not lower in Britain, Mr. Rombotis said, but the company's research is subsidized by the Scottish government.
 The United States has long been the biotechnology world's leader and remains so. But when it comes to spinning science into start-ups, other countries have caught up. Europe now has 1,613 biotech companies, more than the 1,415 in the United States, according to Ernst & Young. A decade ago, Europe had only 584 such companies, compared with 1,308 in the United States.
 The European companies, though, are typically smaller than their American counterparts -- 45 employees on average, compared with 96 here, according to Critical I, a British consulting firm. More crucially, they often lack the capital to get beyond the early stages of research and development. Last year, biotechnology companies raised only $3.3 billion in Europe, compared with $16 billion in the United States, according to BioCentury, an industry newsletter. 
 American companies on average also spend 3 times as much on R.& D. and have access to 10 times as much debt financing as their European counterparts, according to a Critical I report released in May by EuropaBio, a trade group based in Brussels. Compared with Europe, it is also much easier for public companies in the United States to raise additional money, through secondary stock offerings or private placements. 
 Thus the wave of immigrant companies, like the BioVex Group, which was founded near Oxford, England, but moved its headquarters to Cambridge, Mass., last year because it had begun clinical trials of its cancer treatment in the United States and also wanted better access to capital. Although its scientists remain in Britain, BioVex recently used its American base to file for an initial public stock offering on Nasdaq.
 Some of the foreign companies intent on a Nasdaq listing have sidestepped an I.P.O. by doing a reverse merger with an American company that has already gone public -- in some cases a biotechnology company that has foundered. 
 That is what Cyclacel did. It agreed last December to be nominally acquired by Xcyte Therapies of Seattle, although Cyclacel is now the name of the company and the entity in charge. Cyclacel then took advantage of its adopted Nasdaq listing by raising an additional $45 million in April through a private placement of stock and warrants. 
 Similarly IDM, a French drug developer, completed a reverse merger last August to acquire the Nasdaq listing of Epimmune. IDM is now based in Irvine, Calif., although its research operation and most of its employees remain in France. 
 Likewise the German company Micromet now has a Nasdaq listing and a base of operations in Carlsbad, Calif., after reverse-merging in May with CancerVax. Most of its operations are still back in the home country. 
 In May, a company started by venture capitalists in Denmark to develop a drug for osteoporosis went public through a reverse merger with an American shell company, Castle & Morgan Holdings. It then raised $10 million in a private placement, mainly from American investors. Originally called Nordic Bone, the drug company is now based in San Francisco and has a more cosmopolitan name, Osteologix. 
 There may be limits, though, to the immigration trend. 
 Industry executives say it has become more difficult than in the past for very young companies to go public on the Nasdaq. A company now usually needs to have drugs at least close to reaching the market before it can be listed. And some small companies say it can be too costly to comply with the financial controls that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed in 2002, has imposed on public companies. 
 Last year for the first time, the number of biotechnology companies going public in Europe -- 23 -- surpassed the number in the United States, 13, according to Ernst & Young. This year, two American companies have even gone public on the Alternative Investment Market in London instead of in the United States, although neither has moved its headquarters to London. 
 One of them, Entelos, a Foster City, Calif., developer of computer simulations of diseases, raised about $20 million in the London market. The other Aqua Bounty, a Waltham, Mass., company trying to win approval in the United States for a genetically engineered salmon, raised about $35 million in London. 
 ''I have trouble raising money in the States, and yet you can raise money on a transgenic fish in a place where they'd never allow it,'' said Elliot Entis, the chief executive of Aqua Bounty, referring to opposition to genetically modified foods in Europe.
 Asterand, a supplier of tissue samples for pharmaceutical research, did a reverse merger with a publicly traded British company in December to gain a listing in London, even though most of Asterand's operations remain in Detroit. 
 ''The cost of being a U.K. public company is significantly lower'' than in the United States, said Randal Charlton, the chief executive. 
 Another limiting factor to the immigration trend is that big American investors are increasingly placing some of their financial bets abroad. 
 ''Today you do not need to be listed on Nasdaq,'' said Wolfgang Sohngen, chief executive of Paion, a German company traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. ''Sophisticated investors invest globally.'' 
 Paion, which is developing a stroke drug derived from vampire bat saliva, recently raised 9.44 million Euros in a private stock offering. Among the investors were J. P. Morgan Proprietary Equities of New York and Xmark Opportunity Fund of Stamford, Conn.
 There are also logistical challenges in coming to America. Oxxon Therapeutics, a British company, moved its headquarters to Boston two years ago but has since moved back. ''It's extremely difficult to manage small operations on both sides of the Atlantic,'' said Craig R. Smith, Oxxon's chairman. 
 Yet, for many overseas biotech companies, an American address still seems the best bet for raising money. That is especially so for companies from Australia and New Zealand, which suffer not only from small capital markets in their home countries but isolation from the pharmaceutical mainstream. 
 When Dianna L. DeVore was chief operating officer of the Australian Stem Cell Center, a government-backed organization, she trumpeted Australia as a leader in the development of regenerative medicine. But now that Ms. DeVore is starting a company, Jiva Biosciences, to commercialize technology developed by research institutes in Melbourne, she is exploring locations in California for her headquarters. 
 Jiva will do its research in Australia, working on drugs to stimulate tissue repair. But Ms. DeVore, an American, says a California headquarters will give the company access to people experienced in bringing drugs to market, a bigger pool of investors and potential access to the state's planned $3 billion in public spending on stem cell research. 
 Protemix, a privately held New Zealand company, is setting up its headquarters in San Diego with an eye toward eventually going public. But research will stay in New Zealand, said Larry K. Ellingson, the chief executive. With the New Zealand government subsidizing the research ''we just can't afford to move it,'' he said. 
 When foreign companies do establish an American beachhead, reaction back home can vary. Some biotechnology boosters in Europe have used the moves to argue that additional tax incentives or other support is needed for European companies. 
 Some companies, like the British transplant Domantis, argue that having financial and commercial operations in the United States actually benefits the home country by funneling money back to the local economy. 
 ''I think there are a lot of people in the U.K. who think this is an ideal way to exploit the innovation from the U.K.,'' said Bob Connelly, the chief executive of Domantis, which is based in Waltham, Mass. Although started by scientists in Cambridge, England, in 2000, the company planned from the outset to base its chief executive and a few other officers in the United States.
 In Scotland, meanwhile, Cyclacel's expatriation did raise eyebrows. But Scottish Enterprise, the government-backed economic development agency that gave Cyclacel the $9 million, put the best face on the situation. It noted that the company's research was staying in Scotland, as it must do until 2010 under the terms of the agreement for the cash infusion. 
 ''We are delighted to see a Scottish company like Cyclacel internationalize in this way,'' Kate Friel, a spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise, said in a statement sent by e-mail. ''We believe that this move has also enhanced Scotland's global reputation for scientific discovery and exploitation.''

HEADLINE: A Pot of Tax-Free Bonds for Post-9/11 Projects Is Empty

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
A milestone was reached yesterday in the federal Liberty Bonds program, which was created to help Lower Manhattan and the New York economy recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by giving developers access to billions of dollars in low-cost tax-exempt financing.
 Once officials issue the bonds that were earmarked yesterday, the $8 billion designated for the program will be depleted, ending a program that critics say has benefited developers and high-profile corporations at the expense of ordinary New Yorkers.
 As part of an agreement reached with the developer Larry A. Silverstein in April, the city Industrial Development Agency gave preliminary approval to using all but $50 million of its remaining bond authorization for projects at the World Trade Center site, including $702 million for the Freedom Tower and the retail portion of the office buildings, which will be owned by the Port Authority. (Mr. Silverstein's recently opened 7 World Trade Center received $475 million in Liberty Bonds; three additional towers on the site will receive $2.6 billion, provided that Mr. Silverstein meets his deadlines.)
 The other $50 million in bonds was tentatively approved for a 220-room luxury hotel to be developed by the Moinian Group, a New York developer, on a site south of ground zero adjacent to the Deutsche Bank Building, which is scheduled for demolition. 
 Joseph Moinian, the chief executive, applied for Liberty Bond financing more than a year ago and watched with concern while other projects, like the new 43-story Goldman Sachs headquarters on West Street, got ahead of him in line. He had said that without tax-free financing he would be unable to include a hotel in his 53-story project at 123 Washington Street because the returns to his investors would not be enough to justify the risk. The $240 million building, to be designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, will also have 180 residential condominiums.
 The hotel financing is contingent on a required survey of the demand for rooms in Lower Manhattan. Real estate specialists say, however, that the study is likely to show that Lower Manhattan, which has only 2,500 rooms, is not now meeting the demand.
 Mr. Moinian said his hotel would cater to tourists and office workers. ''You need hotels, restaurants and places to hang out,'' he said. ''We don't have that right now in this part of town.'' Getting preliminary approval for the bonds will enable him to negotiate with hotel chains, he said.
 Authorized by Congress in 2002, the Liberty Bonds program is unusual in that it awards bonds exempt from federal, state and city taxes to commercial projects that are not in blighted areas. The city and state were authorized to issue $4 billion worth of bonds each, with up to $1.6 billion to be used for residential rental projects and up to $2 billion for commercial buildings outside the so-called Liberty Zone, below Canal Street.
 New commercial projects receiving Liberty financing had to be 20,000 square feet within the Liberty Zone and 100,000 square feet in other neighborhoods. The bonds are issued by four city and state agencies, which follow different procedures.
 From the outset, residential developers were eager to take advantage of the program. In all, Liberty Bonds went to 13 residential buildings with 4,468 market-rate units, including one that was already in the works before the attacks. Two additional projects, with at least 500 apartments, are awaiting final approval.
 Bettina Damiani, a project director for Good Jobs New York, a nonprofit organization that has monitored the Liberty Bond program, noted that firefighters, police officers and teachers would not be able to afford to live in the market-rate housing built with public subsidies. ''All the brilliant minds we have in New York couldn't find a way to develop housing that would benefit everyone,'' she said. ''They are going to use federal funds to help create an economically gentrified area.''
 But Ms. Damiani praised the Bloomberg administration for imposing fees of 3 percent to 5 percent on apartment developers who received Liberty Bonds from the city. The fees generated $19.3 million and financed the construction of six buildings in Queens, the Bronx and East Harlem for low- and middle-income tenants, according to the city Housing Development Corporation. Five percent of the apartments financed through the state's share of Liberty Bonds must be reserved for moderate-income tenants.
 If developers of residential projects were quick to embrace the Liberty Bond program, commercial developers were much slower to respond. So early on, officials awarded the low-interest financing to other projects that they believed would benefit the city's economy. A division of Forest City Ratner got $90.8 million worth of financing to build a new office tower in downtown Brooklyn for the Bank of New York, which suffered heavy losses on Sept. 11. (Forest City Ratner, The New York Times Company's partner in the development of a new headquarters building on Eighth Avenue, applied for Liberty Bond financing for that project but was turned down.)
 In a more controversial move, the city awarded $650 million worth of bonds for the 51-story Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park, which the Durst Organization and the bank are building at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas, in what is now one of the hottest real estate markets in the country. 
 In the only other successful Liberty Bond application for a project outside downtown, the IAC/InterActiveCorp, an Internet company founded by Barry Diller that owns TicketMaster and Ask.com, received $80 million for a new headquarters building designed by Frank Gehry along the West Side Highway at 18th Street. 
 In seeking the bonds, InterActiveCorp promised to increase its New York work force to 382, from 237, by June 30, 2008. It now has 330 employees, a company spokeswoman said. Without Liberty Bonds, the company's decision to build on the fringe of Chelsea would not have been viable, said Joseph B. Rose, a partner in the Georgetown Company, the developer. Mr. Rose was chairman of the city planning commission under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 In retrospect, the Liberty Bonds program should have been more restrictive, said Petra Todorovich, a senior planner for the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning organization. ''There are no longer bonds available for additional commercial development in Lower Manhattan and we probably could have used some more,'' she said. ''New York had less trouble recovering than Lower Manhattan. If we could redesign the program today, we would direct more of those funds toward Lower Manhattan only.'' 
 State and city officials also faced criticism for awarding $1.7 billion worth of Liberty Bonds to Goldman Sachs, but Joshua J. Sirefman, the interim president of the city Economic Development Corporation, said the decision was crucial to breathing life into the downtown office market, which is showing signs of improvement. ''The commitment from Goldman Sachs was probably one of the single strongest statements on the ongoing vitality of Lower Manhattan as a global financial center, particularly at a time when that was surrounded by uncertainty,'' he said.
 Apart from the World Trade Center sites, the Goldman Sachs headquarters, the three projects outside the Liberty Zone, and the Moinian hotel, only three other relatively modest commercial projects will benefit from the program -- a Greenwich Street boutique hotel that is partly owned by Robert De Niro; the National Sports Museum, which will be built at 26 Broadway; and some retail space for the new apartment buildings.
 But Mr. Sirefman said that the program's goal had been fulfilled and that there were few other sites available in Lower Manhattan for commercial development. ''Our top priority has always been the trade center,'' he said. ''The program has been well used.''

HEADLINE: Hold That Line, but Don't Hesitate to Supersize the Coaching Staff

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
In 1970, Marv Levy joined George Allen's coaching staff with the Los Angeles Rams. Allen had assistants for the offensive and defensive lines, the backfield, the receivers, the linebackers and the secondary. His idea, to hire Levy to handle only the special teams, was new in the N.F.L.
 ''We had a burgeoning staff of seven,'' Levy, the 80-year-old former coach of the Buffalo Bills, said in a recent telephone interview. ''Now I'm saying, 'Wait, what's going on here?' ''
Allen's cozy collection of coaches is a thing of the past. Like the waistlines of offensive linemen, N.F.L. staffs as well as those in other sports have been supersized in recent years. 
 When football teams begin reporting to training camps during the next two weeks, the fields will be more crowded than ever. Nineteen of the 32 N.F.L. teams list staffs of 18 or more assistants (five teams have at least 20 assistants), including coaches for strength and conditioning. Just three teams list 15 or fewer. Those staffs are built to run teams that have 53-man rosters during the season, meaning that in many cases there is more than one coach for every three players.
 Coaching inflation is not limited to football. Major League Baseball restricts teams to six coaches. But the Yankees, for example, have two special instructors who can be with the team before games and during spring training, but not in uniform during games.
 In the N.B.A., the Dallas Mavericks may have set a standard in 2000: 13 assistants, including some called ambassadors. The Knicks had six assistants last season, still a large staff by current standards, and the Boston Celtics recently announced that their staff, which had seven coaches last season, would go to four -- in a sport that has five players per team on the floor.
 But the trend may be most pronounced in football, where there are plenty of titles to go around. Miami (19 assistants) has a special assistant to the head coach and an assistant head coach/offense/wide receivers. The Jets (19) have two coaches for wide receivers. Atlanta (19) has a consultant near the top of the organizational chart. Dallas (14) has a coach dedicated to middle linebackers.
 Many teams have two offensive line coaches -- one for tackles and one for centers and guards. Teams have separate coaches for cornerbacks and safeties. Some have a coach to dissect third-down and long-yardage defenses.
 ''I call them French movie directors when they have all those titles,'' Kansas City Coach Herman Edwards, whose staff of 16 seems modest, said in a telephone interview. ''Can you imagine having a staff meeting with that many? You'd need to get a security guard.''
 The growth in staff size is a relatively recent development. Vince Lombardi had six assistants when his Green Bay Packers played in Super Bowl I.
 Edwards said he remembered there were fewer than a dozen assistants when he was a player in Philadelphia. But his coach there was Dick Vermeil, his predecessor in Kansas City. How times have changed: Vermeil had 20 assistants last season, including two each for the offensive and defensive lines, the special teams and the secondary. There were so many coaches that it caused a logjam in the bench area during games.
 The N.F.L. limits a home team to 27 people and the visiting team to 25 in the bench area, excluding players in uniform eligible to play. That includes doctors, trainers, equipment staff members and players not in uniform. The battle is to figure out who gets one of those coveted credentials.
 ''And everybody wants a headphone,'' Edwards said.
 The expansion began, Edwards said, when coordinators no longer coached a position, necessitating the addition of two more position coaches. ''That was the first thing that opened Pandora's box,'' he said.
 Levy, who returned this season as the Bills' general manager, said technology changed everything. All of those video clips and computer breakdowns demand more people to analyze the data. ''Technology did not simplify work,'' Levy said. ''It complicated it.'' 
 The Bills, incidentally, have 16 assistants.
 Now, quality-control assistants sift through the mountain of information to try to make it manageable. They are generally in the early stages of their careers and making salaries of $50,000 or $60,000 a year, Edwards said. Top coordinators can make seven-figure salaries.
 The advent of free agency in the N.F.L. also played a role. Because of greater roster turnover, players require more instruction, sometimes individualized, to learn a new system.
 The Washington Redskins, who seem to collect big-name assistants as if they were pieces of art, have an assistant head coach for offense, an associate head coach for offense and an offensive coordinator on a staff of 20 assistants. The team is led by Joe Gibbs, an offensive-minded coach.
 ''Everyone is trying to get a jump and do a better job of coaching people,'' Gibbs said. ''The edge is that we have no cap on coaching staffs. So you are trying to get the best coaches, which in turn means more coaches. In the old days, we had two weight guys. Now we have three full-time guys and four part-time guys. Now we have one-on-one weight training. That is obviously a better program than mass weight lifting.''
 The annual churn on coaching staffs prompted Dolphins Coach Nick Saban to borrow a technique from his friend Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots. When Belichick was in Cleveland, he put a number of young people on his staff, including the Jets' new head coach, Eric Mangini. The idea was to develop coaches from within.
 ''I don't know how much he paid them, but it was to give a guy a chance and give him a start, and then you develop your own guy,'' Saban said. ''Everybody counts those guys as coaches, but they're really intern positions.''
 The trend does not receive universal approval. Edwards and Levy worry about mixed messages being received by players who must answer to at least two position coaches. Edwards prefers for his coaches to have ownership of their positions.
 Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the Patriots, agrees and compared coaching staffs to any business.
 ''When you want to get a message through, you want accountability,'' Kraft said. ''It's like middle management: if you have a lot, it's hard to get through.''
 Chester Pitts, an offensive lineman for the Houston Texans (19 assistants) said he had experienced inconsistencies when there were multiple coaches at the same position. He said players from other teams talk about the problem, too.
 ''If you have eight parents and one says do it one way and another says do it another way, who do you listen to?'' Pitts said. ''Would you get in trouble if you do it one way?''
 But Pitts also said having more coaches could be effective, especially if the head coach worked to avoid inconsistencies in the messages and lessons directed at players.
 ''Are you going to send your kid to a school that has 20 students to one teacher, or 10 students to one?'' Pitts said.
 Whether quantity equals quality remains to be seen. Levy said he did not think so. His last staff in Buffalo, in 1997, had 12 assistants. Gibbs won Super Bowl XVII with 11 assistants. The Pittsburgh Steelers, winners of Super Bowl XL, have 16.
 And the smallest staff in the league? New England has 12 assistants. Maybe Belichick knows something. His staff is shrinking. In February 2005, he won his third Super Bowl with 14 assistants.

HEADLINE: Promises of Atlantic Yards Draw Thousands to Meeting

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Before an attentive audience of would-be renters last night, supporters of the $3.5 billion Atlantic Yards project hailed its promise of hundreds of apartments as a small battle won against the city's housing crunch and a boon to Brooklyn's plumbers, police officers and secretaries.
 ''People leave Brooklyn not for the good life, but because they can't afford the good life that we already have here,'' said Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president and a staunch ally of the project's developer, Forest City Ratner Companies. 
 About 2,300 people attended the first of two presentations at a Marriott in Brooklyn last night, roughly one person for each of the 2,250 units of below-market-price, rent-stabilized units the company says it will build if the project is approved. Forest City Ratner officials said they expected up to 1,000 more people at the second session, which like the first was organized to provide details about the project's rental units to those most likely to apply for them.
 Forest City Ratner is the development partner in building a new Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company. 
 Details of the project's below-market-price apartments, which would make up half of the total number of rental units in the 8.7 million-square-foot development, were negotiated last year with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, an advocacy group for low-income people known as Acorn. But last night's presentations served as an early test of local interest in Forest City's plans, and the audience members, many of them from Brooklyn neighborhoods that have seen promises of housing and jobs go unfulfilled before, listened with high hopes and some wariness. 
 ''The information was interesting,'' said Edan Greenidge, 29, a salesman who attended with his mother, Merlyn. But he added: ''It's still not too affordable. I'm still skeptical.'' 
 Joseph Shearin, 48, a transit worker, praised the housing allotment and said he planned to apply for one of the rental apartments if the project, which is being reviewed by a state development agency, is approved and built. 
 ''I think it's wonderful that they're doing this,'' he said.
 Forest City officials said 18,000 people responded to promotional literature that the company mailed to Brooklyn households in mid-May.
 Housing is the largest component of the Atlantic Yards project, which also includes a basketball arena, offices and some retail space on a site near Downtown Brooklyn.
 As currently constituted, the program would distribute the 2,250 units across five different income tiers tied to the city's median income. All would be allocated through a lottery system run by Acorn and supervised by the city's housing agency, with some preference going to residents of the surrounding neighborhoods, police officers and other civil service workers, the elderly, and the disabled, as required by city rules.
 In the lowest income tier, a family of four making $21,270 to $28,360 a year would pay $620 a month in rent; in the highest, a family making $99,261 to $113,440 would pay $2,658 a month. About 225 units are set aside for families of all sizes in the lowest income tier, and 450 for families of all sizes in the highest tier.
 Vilia Salas, 44, a bookkeeper, said she supported the project. Her only concern, she said, is that not enough units will go to ''people who are really entitled to them.''
 Some attendees of last night's event, while expressing enthusiasm for the project's hope of new housing in a borough that needs it, wondered whether the moderately priced housing was priced quite moderately enough.
 ''I think that certain things weren't taken into account when they came up with the income bands,'' said Sharon Reid, a college administrator.
 But Mr. Markowitz and Bertha Lewis, Acorn's executive director, said the project would constitute one of the city's largest increases of rent-stabilized, moderately priced housing in years at a time when the city's stock of such housing has been disappearing more rapidly than housing agencies and advocacy organizations can replenish it.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Spending To Grow 10% Under New Budget 

BYLINE: AP; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
State spending under the budget deal agreed to by Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature last month will grow by about 10 percent, roughly three times the rate of inflation, the state comptroller, Alan Hevesi, reported yesterday. Mr. Hevesi said his review of the final budget deal, based on preliminary figures, indicated that state spending would grow twice as fast as revenue. ''This is not sustainable for the long term,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Teachers, and a Law That Distrusts Them 

BYLINE: By Michael Winerip. 
E-mail: edmike@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THIS is my last education column after four years. What I will miss most is the free ticket it gave me into classrooms all over the country, where I watched and learned from teachers.
 I got to be there at 7:15 a.m. on the first day of this school year with Irene Ray, a terrific high school English teacher in Huntington, W. Va. Ms. Ray had intended to leave small-town Appalachia long ago for the big city, but there she was again, for her 23rd first day, sipping a Diet Coke, nibbling an Atkins breakfast bar, more excited and jittery than her students, wanting to know how their summer reading went, whether they'd enjoyed ''The Scarlet Letter'' or, like Ms. Ray, preferred ''The Poisonwood Bible.''
 Ms. Ray spent a week readying her room for the first day, including adding to the favorite quotations that line her walls. Bored students distracted by iPods and the Internet? ''She's got new quotes,'' whispered a girl, who was reading Ms. Ray's walls. 
 I also got to be there at 3:15 p.m. on the final day of school this year, in Dahlonega, Ga., at Lumpkin County Middle School, when Pat New, a science teacher, taught her last lesson, after 29 years. Ms. New, 62, had fought to the end for her right to teach evolution, winning out against a group of parents and students and an administration that preferred not to make waves.
 The columns about teachers generated the most mail, but lots of others were fun to write. Chronicling the mess-ups with New York State's standardized exams -- in math, English, English as a second language, physics, reading -- was always great sport.
 But the people who took me to the heart of education? Laurin MacLeish, kindergarten teacher in Orlando, Fla.; Roger Cline, diesel engine teacher in Canton, Ohio; Jeff Kaufman, G.E.D. teacher at the Rikers jail in New York City; Liza Levine, English teacher in South Central Los Angeles.
 Principals? A little bit. Superintendents? Chancellors? State education commissioners? You can probably still name your kindergarten teacher (that would be Miss Goddard, Beechwood Knoll School, 1957). But how about the secretary of education during any of your 13 years in school?
 The education press spends so much time writing about people far removed from the classroom that it's easy to lose sight of those individuals' real purpose -- to help teachers do their jobs well, the best hope for student success.
 As readers know, I'm not a fan of No Child Left Behind, the 2002 federal law aimed at raising education quality. Instead of helping teachers, for me it's a law created by politicians who distrust teachers. Because teachers' judgment and standards are supposedly not reliable, the law substitutes a battery of state tests that are supposed to tell the real truth about children's academic progress. 
 The question is: How successful can an education law be that makes teachers the enemy?
 Even No Child's strongest supporters acknowledge that one of the law's most important provisions -- to guarantee a highly qualified teacher in every classroom -- has been the most poorly carried out to date. 
 So, to improve classroom teaching and make teachers more enthusiastic about the law, I have three departing suggestions for when the legislation is expected to come up for reauthorization next year.
 First, why not add a provision rewarding states and districts that mandate small class size? It's an idea that enjoys great support among parents and teachers and is easily carried out on a national scale.
 Why small class size? Deborah Meier, the teacher, principal, author and MacArthur Award winner who has created successful public schools in New York and Boston, says the best chance for educating poor children well is surrounding them with as many talented adults as possible. The same premise drives one of the most hopeful efforts in urban education today, the Gates Foundation's small schools movement.
 Joe Gipson, a black public school parent in California, which has had a mandatory cap of 20 in grades K to three for a decade, told me small class size is the best thing that's happened to his children's education, giving them what rich private school pupils have. While small class size is no guarantee that teachers will be good, he said, with just 20, you can tell faster if teachers are performing well, and get rid of them if they're not.
 Gov. Jeb Bush is very popular in Florida, and in 2002, he opposed a constitutional amendment to cap class sizes, including a maximum of 18 for grades K to three. He said it would be too costly. And yet voters in Florida, hardly a tax-and-spend state, voted for it. Every year since, the Republican governor has tried overturning the class size amendment, and every year he has lost, most recently last spring, when the Republican-controlled State Senate defeated his efforts.
 ''It's a moral issue,'' said Senator J. Alex Villalobos, a Republican whose wife is a public school teacher. ''Class size is the great equalizer. Anybody who has children understands this. We have a moral responsibility to take care of our children.''
 In 2003, 115,000 New York City residents signed petitions aimed at setting class size limits, and in 2005, 100,000 did. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said the city cannot afford to do more now, and has successfully stalled advocates' efforts in court, but at a price to children. A recent state audit shows that 26 percent of New York City children in grades K to three are in classes of 25 or more.
 The intent of the No Child law could not be more important -- to narrow the achievement gap between white and minority children. But what angers public educators is that under the law, schools get all the blame if students fail, when they see many other variables at play, including the crippling effects of poverty on families. Studies show that the economic status of a child's family has a major impact on a child's performance on standardized tests. On the SAT, for example, for every $10,000 increase in family income, a child's SAT scores rise about 10 points. 
 Which leads to my second proposal. We need a No Family Left Behind Law. This would measure economic growth of families and punish politicians in charge of states with poor economic growth for minority families.
 FOR example, in Ohio, black families earn only 62 percent of white household income, one of the biggest disparities nationally. So every year, under No Family Left Behind, Ohio would be expected to close that income gap. If it failed to make adequate yearly progress for black families' wealth, the governor and legislators would be judged failing, and after five years, could be removed from office. This way public schools wouldn't be the only institutions singled out for failing poor children.
 And if states succeeded in closing the economic gap, test scores would be expected to rise, giving politicians and teachers a chance to celebrate together.
 A final concern with the federal law is that it is so driven by state testing that there's too much time devoted to test prep, too much time spent drilling facts for survey courses, and not enough emphasis on finding something children will fall in love with for a lifetime -- the Civil War, repairing engines, science research, playing the trumpet.
 Fortunately, the remedy can be found on Ms. Ray's walls in Huntington, W. Va., a quotation from William Butler Yeats: ''Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.'' I recommend that as the official motto for a new, revitalized No Child Left Behind law.

HEADLINE: Olympics Imperil Historic Beijing Neighborhood

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
A short walk from Tiananmen Square and the Great Hall of the People, a historic neighborhood named Qianmen is an eerie picture of destruction. Ancient homes lie in rubble. Scavengers squat in alleyways and wait to ransack vacated buildings. 
 The reason for the devastation is the 2008 Olympic Games, which have turned much of the city into a noisy, disjointed construction zone. New subway lines and new roads are under construction, even an entire new downtown. On the city's northern rim, at least 25,000 laborers are building the Olympic stadiums and village.
 And yet amid such grandiose projects, it is modest Qianmen, once the domain of Qing Dynasty opera singers and classical scholars, that is prompting an uneasy question. Will the Olympics, which organizers promised would enhance the city's ''cultural heritage,'' instead help finish off what remains of old Beijing?
 Many streets and hundreds of courtyard houses have been demolished, but the neighborhood is not yet entirely gone. Scholars, preservationists and residents are trying to save what is left and have generated enough publicity to turn the situation into a political controversy. For now, though, demolition crews are still slowly moving forward. 
 ''Does this look like a scene from quaint Beijing or more like a war zone?'' asked Pan Jinyu, 64, a local resident, as he stood on a narrow street pockmarked by flattened houses. Not far away, a red and white propaganda banner fluttered over a razed building: ''Build a New Beijing and Welcome the Olympics.''
 For an Olympic host, the task of building stadiums and sprucing up the city often involves messy land disputes. 
 Before the 1996 Games, Atlanta knocked down a public housing complex beside its Olympic village. Qianmen is not a site for an Olympic venue but is a piece of the continuing citywide construction boom and slum clearance that have accelerated to prepare for the Games. 
 For the past decade many of the city's old ''hutong'' neighborhoods, the ancient, densely populated enclaves of narrow, winding streets and crumbling courtyard houses, have been steadily demolished and replaced by office towers and high-rise apartments. 
 Affordable housing has become such a serious problem that many people from old Beijing have been forced to the city's outskirts because they can no longer afford to live in their old neighborhoods.
 Qianmen was one of the last intact hutongs, home to teachers, shop owners, migrant workers and other working-class people. But with its central location, the neighborhood's land is enormously valuable. And because it has fallen into disrepair, many residents believe that officials do not want the neighborhood to be an eyesore at the center of the city during the Olympics. 
 ''They are moving forward with this quickly because of the Olympics,'' Mr. Pan said. ''This neighborhood is the face of Beijing to the world. They don't want foreigners to see this scarred old face.''
 Little is known about the specific plans for the project or who will benefit from it. Communist Party officials and private developers often work in tandem, and so many deals are tinged with corruption that top leaders have led a campaign against illegal land seizures and evictions. 
 A Beijing vice mayor, Liu Zhihua, was recently removed from his post and accused of corruption. Mr. Liu's portfolio included construction of the Olympic venues and final authority for citywide demolitions.
 Jin Yan, a deputy director in the construction office of the Beijing Olympic Committee, said that Qianmen was not an official Olympic project and that it fell outside his purview. Yet he agreed that the Olympics were driving the broader construction now engulfing the city.
 In Qianmen, the main street, Qianmen Avenue, is being converted into a pedestrian thoroughfare with restaurants and shops. But officials have been deliberately vague about their plans for the residential areas, despite persistent rumors that the neighborhood will be redeveloped with million-dollar courtyard homes. 
 Officials have refused to discuss the plans or to detail which blocks may be demolished. Residents usually find out only when leaflets are posted on the outer walls of their houses, warning that a timeline has been set for certain lanes to be torn down.
 One municipal Web site is filled with postings from anxious residents asking, ''Are you going to knock down my house?''
 On the east side of the neighborhood, part of Chongwen District, many houses are already gone. Wide paths of demolition, as if carved by tornadoes, mark where new roads are planned. 
 ''At nighttime this becomes the most dangerous place in Beijing,'' said one resident, Zheng Zhongping. ''The rats are so hungry, they are chasing people. All the food they used to eat is gone. People board up their homes, but thieves still break in.''
 One recent afternoon, scavengers pedaled carts along the narrow streets, carrying cardboard and scrap wood. Many are farmers from poor provinces who follow demolition projects to make a living. ''The demolition is good for business, because there is lots of trash,'' one man said.
 Another man walked by and pointed to government signs promising that some parts of the neighborhood would be saved. ''These signs are useless,'' he said angrily. ''They are going to tear it down. It will all be gone.''
 Yet another man, dressed in a long leather coat, chimed in, spitting out his words. ''All their talk is hot air,'' he said. ''This is just theft. I can't even buy a tent with the money they are giving us.''
 Those who have stayed in the Chongwen side are mostly holdouts angry about the compensation. Feng Shuqin, 76, and her husband, Zheng Zhanlin, 75, lived in their traditional courtyard house for 50 years. His father owned the property before the Communists took control in 1949, and the family still has the deed. 
 The house could be a timeline of recent Chinese history. In 1958, facing a housing shortage, the government ordered private houses opened up, and eight other families moved in. In 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards demanded the family's deed and took all of the rent. In 1984, the government returned the deed but still kept the rent. Finally, this year the government ordered them to move and offered them the equivalent of $175,000. The family believes that the land is worth $1.4 million.
 The Zhengs and other residents note that the compensation standard is set at 2001 levels. But in five years, property values have doubled or tripled in some areas of Beijing. After months of holding out, the Zhengs finally moved out in June because their neighbors had left and government-hired demolition companies were harassing them.
 ''They are pushing all the old Beijingers outside the Fifth Ring Road,'' said Feng Shuqin, the wife, referring to one of the roads circling the city. 
 Preservationists and scholars are still trying to save Qianmen from complete destruction. The neighborhood flourished during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), when it was filled with opera halls and boarding houses where scholars from outlying provinces would prepare for the national civil service examination.
 Earlier this year, a group of prominent scholars filed a petition with the National People's Congress, or national legislature, warning that demolishing Qianmen would be more devastating to the cultural heritage of Beijing than the destruction of the ancient city wall by Mao. Scholars also note that Qianmen is supposed to be protected; it is one of 25 neighborhoods designated by the city for historic preservation.
 Xie Chensheng, 85, a nationally known preservationist who signed the petition, said demolition was so rampant that in August 2004 he and other scholars wrote a letter to President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao warning about the destruction of the ancient city. 
 He said Mr. Hu wrote a note in the margins of the letter that was later distributed to lower officials. Mr. Xie quoted the note as saying: ''Take care to protect the old city and protect our cultural heritage. Everyone involved should give their support.''
 The high-level intervention seemed to work. Mr. Xie says no new projects have since been approved, and city planners unveiled a new comprehensive plan in 2005 that included an emphasis on historic preservation. 
 But Mr. Xie said the Qianmen project proceeded because it had already been approved. Local officials told residents that the redevelopment was necessary because the old homes were unsafe, a point later refuted by an academic study.
 Mike Meyer, an American who lives in the neighborhood and is writing a book about it, said other international cities, like Vienna, managed to preserve their ancient neighborhoods. He said that Qianmen could also be restored, block by block, but that officials were instead methodically mowing it down.
 ''They are doing it in stages,'' he said. ''It's progressing like a wave cresting.'' He said the gradual approach had left many residents elsewhere in the city unaware of the scope of the demolition. Comparing it to New York, he added, ''It's like one morning you woke up and Chelsea was gone.''

HEADLINE: Israel Expands Offensive, Moving Into Central Gaza

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and GREG MYRE; Steven Erlanger reported from Gaza for this article, and Greg Myre from Jerusalem.

DATELINE: GAZA, Wednesday, July 12 

 BODY:
Israeli troops moved in force into central Gaza early Wednesday, expanding a two-week-old Israeli offensive intended to release a captured soldier and stop rocket fire into Israel.
 Just after midnight, scores of tanks, armored personnel carriers and armored bulldozers, covered by Apache attack helicopters and armed drones, crossed into central Gaza near Kissufim.
Clearing roads and firing tank shells, the troops have moved about 150 yards southeast of the town of Deir al Balah, into the neighborhood of Abu Alajeen, residents there say. 
 At least one Palestinian, a member of the official security forces, died in an exchange of fire with Israeli troops, and another was wounded, according to a Palestinian journalist living in Abu Alajeen, as the sound of tank shell explosions made him difficult to hear over the phone.
 About 3 a.m., there was an Israeli airstrike on a house owned by a local Hamas leader in the Sheik Radwan district of Gaza City, residents said. The Associated Press reported that six people were killed. The army said that it believes that it wounded the commander of the military wing of Hamas, Muhammad Deif, in the attack, but a Hamas spokesman told Reuters that report was ''totally incorrect.''
 In the south, Israeli forces advanced from positions near Abassan north toward Abu Alajeen.
 Israelis are also interrupting local radio stations to broadcast a warning in Arabic that ''the Israeli Army is going to continue its operation in the Gaza Strip until the captive soldier is released.'' The broadcast says: ''Israel is interested in your well-being. Is this the welfare that Hamas promised you?''
 The message warns Palestinians not to allow militants to fire rockets into Israel.
 Militants tried to fire makeshift rockets toward the Kissufim border crossing as a column of dozens of armored vehicles and hundreds of soldiers pushed into central Gaza, but the rockets appeared to fall short, Reuters reported.
 ''Our main target is the terrorist infrastructure -- the rocket crews, the gunmen, the arms caches,'' said an Israeli commander who was not allowed to give his full name, according to a pool report.
 ''But of course we are here to show that if, God forbid, any of us is captured by the enemy, the army will do everything to secure his return,'' he said.
 The army confirmed only that its troops had entered central Gaza. The Israelis want to ensure that the captured soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, is not moved out of Gaza. He was captured on June 25 during a raid into Israel.
 After news conferences on Monday by Israeli and Hamas leaders repeating their positions -- Hamas demanding a prisoner exchange and Israel rejecting any bargaining with Hamas -- it seemed inevitable that Israel would step up its military campaign, which had slowed after troops pulled out of northern Gaza after taking over parts of the town of Beit Lahiya.
 On Tuesday, the Israeli government had given the military authority to broaden its operations in the territory and pilots carried out a new round of airstrikes, mostly directed at militants in the north who are firing rockets into southern Israel.
 Also, the Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, lashed out at the United States, saying it had been working with Israel to undermine the Hamas-led government, which was elected in January.
 ''Our new government was met from the very beginning by acts of explicit, declared sabotage by the White House,'' Mr. Haniya wrote in an op-ed article in The Washington Post. He said the current Israeli offensive was the ''explosive follow-up to a five-month campaign of economic and diplomatic warfare directed by the United States and Israel.''
 The Palestinian leader also wrote that ''if Israel will not allow Palestinians to live in peace, dignity and national integrity, Israelis themselves will not be able to enjoy those same rights.''
 On Tuesday morning, an Israeli strike killed one Palestinian militant and wounded several more, according to residents in the area. The missile attack took place near Beit Hanoun on a vehicle loaded with rockets traveling to a launching site, according to the Israeli military.
 The local head of Fatah's Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, Abu Ghazal, managed to escape the vehicle unharmed, a group spokesman said.
 The Israeli Air Force also knocked out the remaining span of a bridge in northern Gaza that militants have used to transport rockets, the Israeli military added.
 Overnight, the military said it arrested 18 suspected Palestinian militants throughout the West Bank.
 The Israeli news media reported Tuesday that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had approved plans to broaden the operation in Gaza.
 Israeli troops in the north are trying to stop the rockets, but after two days of heavy fighting last week, the ground forces have pulled back. In southern Gaza, Israeli armored vehicles and troops have taken up positions in and around the Palestinian airport, which has not been used for years. 
 The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, met Tuesday with King Abdullah II in Amman, Jordan, and claimed that the Israeli military was targeting civilians in Gaza.
 King Abdullah said he would appeal to the Israelis to end their offensive, according to a statement.
 Two more Palestinians died Tuesday on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing while waiting in the heat to cross back into Gaza. According to Egyptian officials speaking to news agencies, two teenagers died: a boy, 18, from heatstroke and a girl, 19, who had recently undergone surgery in Egypt. 
 The Rafah crossing has been closed for two weeks, and some 4,000 people are waiting there, according to the United Nations. The Red Cross said 578 of those waiting were ''urgent humanitarian cases.'' Israel has offered to let them into Gaza through a different crossing, Kerem Shalom, which means going through Israel. But the Palestinian Authority has refused, saying there is an international agreement allowing direct travel between Gaza and Egypt. 
 Israel insists that it tries to avoid civilian casualties, but says the Palestinian militants operate from heavily populated areas.
 More than 50 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli offensive began. Most of the dead have been militants.

HEADLINE: Libraries After the Storm

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The State of New Orleans: An Update,'' by Matt Fellowes, Bruce Katz, Amy Liu and Nigel Holmes (Op-Chart, July 5): 
 The good news is that 53 percent of the public libraries in Jefferson Parish are open, although in need of repairs and carpeting. But elsewhere in suburban New Orleans, two of Plaquemines Parish's three libraries and both of St. Bernard's libraries were destroyed. Seven of the 13 libraries in New Orleans itself are still closed.
Although most of Jefferson Parish's 455,000 residents are back, normalcy is an elusive goal. Our library has issued free library cards to almost 10,000 people. But 7 of our 15 libraries remain closed, and we urgently need $18 million from individuals, corporations, foundations and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (which continues to deny claims) to help us build back. 
 Congressional financing is needed to help build 21st-century libraries that will foster a higher level of public education and help the region's economic development.

HEADLINE: Grandma Burned the Beans: A Lucky Break

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
ANNE QUATRANO is one of those unpretentious chefs who don't romanticize the family tables of their childhoods.
 One of her grandmothers, the one who fell in love with an Italian, was a great cook. The other, the one from Ohio who fell in love with a Georgia boy, wasn't.
''But there were two or three things she did that I still absolutely love,'' Ms. Quatrano said on a morning spent cooking in her oversize farm kitchen an hour's drive from Atlanta. 
 One of them was simmering potatoes, country ham and chicken broth into a simple, economical and delicious dish. The other was her recipe for pole beans, the ever-present but unsung heroes of the summer Southern table.
 ''She would take green beans and cook the heck out of them,'' she said. ''She'd throw them in a hot pan, and they'd be almost black.''
 Ms. Quatrano likes the method, even if her grandmother's beans suffered a little in the actual execution. So when pole beans are at their best, young enough to snap crisply in half but old enough to hold their own in a hot saute pan, she uses her grandmother's technique to excellent effect.
 Pole beans, which are also called stick beans or runner beans depending on where you're from, are any sort of bean that climbs easily around a trellis or other support. Harvested throughout the summer, Romanos, Dragon's Tongue and other pole bean varieties are eaten whole. Some, like Scarlet Runners, can be shelled when they are older. 
 But when they are young, like many showing up now at markets and farm stands in the Northeast, they are perfect cooked in a lightly oiled saute pan without blanching.
 Ms. Quatrano's recipe requires only the discipline to keep the heat of the pan high enough so the beans brown well but don't burn. If the beans are fresh, they can achieve a crisp-tender state with just a touch of char in less than 10 minutes.
 The dish reflects the simple ingredient-driven food Ms. Quatrano and her husband, Clifford Harrison, prepare at their three Atlanta restaurants: Bacchanalia (their first), the less formal Floataway Cafe and their newest and most intimate, Quinones at Bacchanalia.
 Quinones offers the purest expression of the 60-acre farm where the couple live. Sauteed pole beans might show up next to a piece of roast wild salmon from Alaska or slices of local lamb brightened with a little mint from their garden.
 At home Ms. Quatrano is likely to serve the pole beans alongside slabs of grilled country bread slathered with fresh chicken liver pate, a combination she finds satisfying as a light supper or a Sunday lunch.
 The pate recipe Ms. Quatrano uses produces one of the finest textures ever to be coaxed out of a pan of chicken livers. 
 There are three tricks. The first is to rinse and dry the chicken livers well before sauteing, so they get crisp on the outside and stay medium-rare inside. 
 The second is to slowly add plenty of very cold butter in little cubes, as the cooked chicken livers whir in a food processor. 
 The third you might be tempted to skip over, but it makes all the difference in the texture. She pushes the pate through a fine strainer to give it a silky finish.
 You can serve it right away, or chill it in jars, then cover it with warm butter or warm fat from a chicken or a duck. The fat will harden and make a seal that keeps it fresh in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.
 ''It's like poor man's foie gras,'' she said.

Pan-Fried Pole Beans With Chicken Liver Crostini
Adapted from Anne Quatrano
Time: 45 minutes (25 minutes for pate, 20 for beans and crostini)

For the chicken liver pate:
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
2 shallots, diced
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 pound chicken livers, deveined
1/2 cup port
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Sugar
1 pound plus 1 tablespoon well-chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
1 pinch curing salt (to help preserve color), optional

For the beans:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound assorted fresh pole beans (such as Dragon's Tongue, Romano, yellow), trimmed
1 spring onion, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, thinly sliced
Sea salt and cracked black pepper

For the crostini:
12 to 16 thin slices crusty bread
Extra virgin olive oil.

1. For chicken liver pate: In a medium saute pan, heat oil, and add shallots, garlic and chicken livers. Saute until livers are medium-rare; add port, and saute until liquid is reduced by half. Season with salt, pepper and sugar to taste.
2. Transfer to a food processor, and puree. With machine running, gradually add cubes of butter until they are incorporated. Add curing salt, if using. Adjust seasonings to taste, push through a fine-mesh screen or strainer and transfer to a ceramic terrine. Covered tightly, the pate can be refrigerated for a week or a bit longer.
3. For beans: Place a large saute pan over medium heat, and heat oil. Add beans, and saute just until lightly browned. Add onion and garlic, and continue to saute until onions are just wilted. Season with salt and pepper.
4. For crostini: Brush slices of bread generously on both sides with oil. Toast on both sides in a hot skillet or on a grill until golden brown.
5. To serve, place equal portions of beans on each of 6 or 8 plates. Season with salt and cracked pepper to taste. Place two slices of bread on each plate, and pass chicken liver pate.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

HEADLINE: Russians And U.S. Push Hard On Trade

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER and STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow for this article and Steven R. Weisman from Washington.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 11 

 BODY:
Russia and the United States are racing to reach a deal this week that would allow Moscow into the World Trade Organization, officials from both countries said on Tuesday. 
 Russia is by far the world's largest economy still outside the W.T.O., a 149-nation group that sets the ground rules for global trade and investment. The United States has withheld its approval for letting the Russians into the organization, even after other countries signed off on membership.
Negotiators say that talks have been held up by lingering disagreements over aircraft tariffs, banking regulations, movie and music piracy and rules for trade in the likes of frozen chicken. 
 In Washington, President Bush suggested that a deal was close. He is scheduled to meet on Friday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for talks before heads of state and government of the Group of 8 leading industrial nations meet this weekend in St. Petersburg. Russia will be the host of the G-8 summit meeting for the first time. 
 ''Hopefully we can get it done,'' Mr. Bush said on Monday. ''I'm optimistic about it.'' His remarks were released by the White House Tuesday evening. The United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, left for Moscow on Tuesday to hold meetings before the weekend, another sign that talks had reached an advanced stage. 
 Bush administration officials said Ms. Schwab's trip was aimed at reaching agreement and clearing the way for a deal on trade with Russia to be announced in time for the St. Petersburg meetings. But they also said that while negotiators had narrowed their differences on several matters, there was no deal yet.
 At a time of tensions with Russia on a range of issues, from Mr. Putin's crackdown on dissent to disagreements on energy policy, the negotiators are working to achieve an accord on two-party trade that would improve the atmosphere for Mr. Bush's visit and for the summit meeting generally.
 The trade disagreements have been bitter in recent months, with Russia charging that the United States has held it to a higher standard on intellectual property and food safety than it has applied to other trading partners. The Bush administration says its standards are the same for all countries that want to join the World Trade Organization.
 Russian officials have suggested that they would hold up possible bids by American-based energy companies like ConocoPhillips to drill for natural gas in the Shtokman fields in the Barents Sea if the trade talks did not make progress. The Bush administration rejects the idea that the two matters should be linked.
 ''W.T.O. accession is a serious business,'' Ms. Schwab said last Friday at a news conference, ''and I think Russia wants to do it right, and we'd like to have Russia do it right. That's what we're trying to accomplish.''
 She also said that Russia had made ''real improvements'' in protecting patents and other safeguards for intellectual property, but that ''we're not there yet'' in getting a full-fledged agreement. Trade officials said the same was true of safeguards on health safety for trade in food.
 From the Russian side, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr D. Zhukov said the negotiations could be concluded this week. ''I hope that they will finish successfully,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
 Russia's economy could get a lift from membership in the W.T.O., though the organization would not help Russia as much as it did China, which exports mainly manufactured goods that face higher tariffs if made by non-W.T.O. members. Russia's largest exports are oil and gas, commodities in demand worldwide and not blocked by trade barriers.
 For Western companies operating in Russia, W.T.O. protections on intellectual property rights could help the makers of goods as diverse as designer clothes and prescription drugs -- these and many other items are routinely faked in Russia.
 On the Internet, Russia still lacks a dispute procedure for Web addresses ending in ''.ru''.
 If the talks are successful, they could put to rest some long-festering disputes in Russian-American trade.
 The United States held out for clear rules on frozen chicken exports, like the chicken first sent to Russia by Tyson Foods of Springdale, Ark., in the early 1990's. The drumsticks became known as Bush Legs after the first President Bush, and were a staple for millions of Russians in lean times. 
 In 1998, Russian authorities banned the chicken on health grounds and in 2003 imposed quotas on poultry, prompting American negotiators to press the matter in W.T.O. talks. It is unclear what concessions, if any, Russia has offered on the frozen chicken dispute. 
 The United States has also kept on the books the Jackson-Vanik amendment of 1974, which tied the trade status of the Soviet Union -- and now Russia -- to an annual review of whether Jews could freely emigrate. The law rankles Russia because it has allowed free emigration since the breakup of the Soviet Union, a point confirmed by most Jewish groups. 
 Any deal on Russia's joining the W.T.O. would require Congress to repeal the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which would otherwise put the United States in violation of the organization's rules, Andrew Somers, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, told journalists Tuesday. 
 At issue in the banking dispute is whether foreign banks could open branches in Russia, or would be required to operate through local subsidiaries regulated by the Russian central bank. The newspaper Kommersant reported Tuesday that the United States had softened its demands on banking. 
 The W.T.O. talks have become a forum for horse trading on business deals between Russia and the United States, and those may now go forward, Mr. Somers and others said.
 Chevron and ConocoPhillips are bidding to join a consortium with Gazprom to develop the Shtokman gas deposits, a deal worth about $10 billion. 
 And Boeing is in a race with Airbus for sales of long-range jets to the Russian state carrier Aeroflot, a transaction for 22 or 23 planes worth about $3 billion.

HEADLINE: Rights Activists Gather to Call for Russian Evolution

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS; Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 11 

 BODY:
The Russian security officers, in plain clothes, arrived in the late afternoon at a hotel where a pro-democracy conference was being held, witnesses said. 
 They swiftly seized four members of a political movement opposed to President Vladimir V. Putin, handcuffed them and rushed them away. Then they turned on a German magazine correspondent who tried to photograph the arrests. One of the officers snatched his camera and left with it, too.
 Hundreds of advocates of civil society and opposition figures opened a two-day conference here on Tuesday, protesting the authoritarian streak that they say defines Mr. Putin's Kremlin and its hold on the Russian state. The Russian state -- predictably, the participants said -- demonstrated precisely some of the behavior that the opposition had assembled to protest. 
 Those attending the conference, held in advance of a meeting of the leaders of the Group of 8 industrial nations scheduled to begin in St. Petersburg this weekend, called themselves The Other Russia. 
 They said their ideals -- including free elections, respect for opposing views and human rights and fair distribution of public wealth -- were a counterpoint to Russia's recent political course. And they said they hoped to urge the leaders of the seven other nations in the group to adjust their foreign policies and put pressure on Mr. Putin to loosen his hold.
 The conference mixed prominent figures from Soviet times, including two veteran human rights campaigners, Lyudmila M. Alekseyeva and Sergei A. Kovalyov, with a younger generation of advocates, including a former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, and Garry Kasparov, the chess master and opposition political figure. All of them have become harsh critics of Mr. Putin and his rule.
 Their list of grievances was a familiar but timely reflection of the broader debate about how to influence the Kremlin, and about whether, issue by issue, Mr. Putin and his circle are best confronted or engaged. 
 They spoke of Russia's police abuses, manifest corruption, arbitrariness of law, restrictions on the news media, crackdown on private organizations and centralization of wealth and power around the Kremlin and its loyal elite. They decried the chilling brutality that has accompanied the wars in Chechnya.
 ''We are gathering together to fight for the triumph of rule of law in our country,'' their public statement read. But even as they released it and speakers were taking turns on the stage, the tensions between Russia's beleaguered public opposition and the government were evident on the margins.
 Participants said more than 40 of their members had been arrested throughout Russia while traveling to the conference here or to St. Petersburg for the Group of 8 meeting. Security officers snatched the four opposition members from the entrance of the Renaissance Moscow Hotel. Mr. Kasparov said the four -- three men and a woman who are members of the National Bolshevik Party -- had been kidnapped. 
 The protests and the police actions were ignored by Russian news programs, which are securely under the Kremlin's sway.
 Other subplots played out as well. Senior Russian officials, irritated that Western diplomats had been invited, had obliquely warned the embassies here not to take part. 
 Igor I. Shuvalov, the Kremlin's senior liaison to the Group of 8, said last month that if foreign governments were represented by senior officials, it would be seen as ''an unfriendly gesture.'' A Kremlin spokesman made a similar remark.
 But when the conference began, senior officials from Western governments were present. One, the British ambassador, Anthony Brenton, even took the stage. He said that ''criticism is as important as a competitive economy'' to a functioning society, and noted that Britain remained involved in the development of Russian civil society and private nongovernmental organizations, or N.G.O.'s
 The United States was represented by two senior diplomats: Daniel Fried, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, and Barry Lowenkron, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor.
 Neither addressed the conference. They said they had come to Russia with a larger portfolio of issues and had meetings on other subjects planned with the Russian government. 
 Their remarks, in an interview with five Western journalists, mixed concerns about elements of the Kremlin's rule with reminders that the United States and Russia had a range of shared interests and areas of productive cooperation. 
 ''This isn't a totalitarian country,'' Mr. Fried said, adding that 20 years ago, during Soviet times, an opposition event like The Other Russia would have been held in secret. ''Or in Helsinki,'' Mr. Lowenkron added.
 But their presence carried an implicit message of support for a wider civil dialogue and a freer society than the Kremlin accepts, and they dismissed Russian warnings about Western attendance. 
 Mr. Fried noted, for instance, that if Russian diplomats in the United States wanted to attend a conference organized by the Democratic Party, ''we wouldn't regard it as anything other than just doing their job.''
 The Kremlin was publicly silent on the matter. But Mikhail V. Margelov, head of the international affairs committee of the upper house of Parliament, lashed out and suggested that the diplomats had made the opposition look like foreign stooges.
 ''What made them addicted to the mirage of The Other Russia on the eve of the Group of 8 summit?'' the Interfax news service quoted him as saying. ''Do experienced diplomats lack understanding that their mere presence at the meeting is the demolition of a structure created by Kasparov and Kasyanov in the eyes of Russians who are tired of following and listening to ideas from abroad?''
 High jinks and stunts were evident as well. As if no Russian opposition meeting of any size could occur without a hidden provocateur, while Mr. Brenton gave his public address a man leaped up in the audience, threw leaflets and shouted, ''All hail the empire!'' 
 He was promptly dragged from the hall, shouting mostly incoherently about Russia's glories, by a group of men, who gave him a liberal beating much of the way.
 He was released at the curb. 
 By nightfall, the spokeswoman for The Other Russia said the four arrested participants had been located at a police station, where they were being interrogated.

HEADLINE: At Europeans' Talks With Tehran About Its Nuclear Future, a Familiar Impasse Endures 

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, July 10 

 BODY:
Five weeks after the world's major powers offered Iran economic and political rewards if it agreed to freeze important nuclear activities, Iran has neither accepted nor rejected the offer, nor even set a date for when it would respond. And it has argued that the United States and its allies have set unrealistic preconditions for talks.
 Indeed, when the two sides met in Brussels on Tuesday, they simply talked past each other, again dashing expectations that the incentives proposal would reinvigorate negotiations. Instead, the talks have stalled, ensuring that nothing will be accomplished before the summit meeting of industrial countries that opens this weekend in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
 ''We're still talking about the framework for talks, not at all about the substance,'' one European official said. 
 In effect, Iran has begun negotiating on its own terms, rejecting the six countries' condition that Tehran freeze all uranium-enrichment activities before substantive talks can begin, and daring them to do something about it.
 ''We should have more time -- be patient and try to negotiate,'' Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, told reporters after three hours of meetings with Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief, and senior European negotiators.
 He said Iran would have to wait until various committees studying the proposal had time to finish their work, adding that Iran had the legal right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to continue enriching uranium.
 In addition to refusing to cease enrichment, Iranian officials are skeptical that the West will deliver on whatever incentives are agreed upon, particularly light-water nuclear reactors. 
 And there appear to be divisions among the Iranians on how hard a line to pursue in negotiations. 
 That the two sides failed to bridge the gaps was painfully obvious in the terse public statements by Mr. Larijani and Mr. Solana. They did not characterize the talks as positive. There was no warmth between them. They took no questions. They did pledge to stay in contact.
 European officials were furious, saying their governments had been lured into talking to Iran while that country was still enriching uranium and while action at the United Nations Security Council was on hold.
 Mr. Larijani also asked for unambiguous assurances that the world powers were ''sincere,'' noting that talk about regime change in Iran created an atmosphere of distrust, a European official said.
 Tuesday's talks included representatives from Russia, France, Germany and Britain for the first time since Mr. Solana presented the offer in Tehran on June 6.
 The United States was not at the table because it had agreed to meet with Iran only after Iran froze its uranium enrichment and formal negotiations began. China, the sixth country involved, did not send a representative.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the foreign ministers of France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China will meet on Wednesday in Paris with Mr. Solana to discuss the next steps, including whether to take Iran's case to the Security Council once again for possible punishment. Given the resistance by Russia and China to punitive action, deciding on a unified plan of action may prove difficult.
 To some officials, the Iranians' refusal to take a stand is nothing more than stalling while they continue to produce enriched uranium, which can be used to generate energy or fuel bombs.
 Iranian officials say otherwise, demanding first that there be no preconditions in advance of formal negotiations. These officials have also said the incentives package came only after Tehran succeeded in running a 164-centrifuge cascade to enrich uranium. To give up their only bargaining chip would be foolish, they say.
 A second demand from Tehran is that it be given guarantees that the incentives will be delivered. Iranian officials have said they have no confidence that the Bush administration will provide sophisticated technology, particularly if there is opposition from Congress.
 Another reason for the delay is apparently a lack of consensus inside Iran.
 Mr. Larijani, who is also secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, reports directly to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader and the country's most powerful official.
 Mr. Larijani does not have full authority over the Iranian nuclear dossier, and operates in an environment of fluid power politics. Some senior clerics and political figures have called for an outright rejection of the proposal. 
 His predecessor was fired last year for appearing too soft in failed talks with Europe over a less generous incentives package.
 At times in Tuesday's talks, Mr. Larijani said he could not answer the questions posed, one European official said.
 Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, which runs the nuclear facilities, has consistently taken a harder line on curbing enrichment. 
 For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei has made clear in high-level meetings that he does not trust the world powers to make good on their promises, according to Iranian officials familiar with the meetings.
 He is particularly distrustful of the United States, which he believes is using the talks as a pretext to eventually harm Iran, but has told his nuclear team that in the interest of ''consensus,'' he would allow them to continue to negotiate, the officials said.
 It is unclear how much influence President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wields in this. Some Iranian officials have said in private that he is an important, if extreme, voice who enjoys the support of the masses but needs to be educated on the language of diplomacy.

HEADLINE: Welcoming the Notice, if Not Necessarily the U.S. Visitors

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: STRALSUND, Germany, July 11 

 BODY:
The last time President Bush visited this country, his seven-hour stopover in the western city of Mainz had all the warmth of a legal deposition. He was on frosty terms with then Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and a jittery police force virtually sealed off the city, shutting six highways and halting river traffic on the Rhine.
 This time, the vibe is palpably better. Angela Merkel, Mr. Schroder's successor, has gotten along well with Mr. Bush, and on her last trip to the United States she invited him to visit this seaside town in northeastern Germany, where she began her political career 15 years ago. 
Yet, with Mr. Bush and the first lady, Laura Bush, scheduled to spend Thursday with Chancellor Merkel here before the two heads of state attend a summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, the town is undergoing a modest version of the security lockdown imposed on Mainz.
 On Tuesday, workers were welding shut manholes in the shadow of St. Nicholas Church. Police said they would cordon off only part of the medieval old town, which the Bushes will tour, disrupting 4,000 residents rather than the tens of thousands put out by the visit in early 2005.
 While eastern Germans are no better disposed toward Mr. Bush than those in the west -- anti-Bush demonstrators said several thousand people would rally on the outskirts of Stralsund -- residents seem generally open to the president's visit, if mostly for reasons of self-interest.
 ''Some people may not consider the Bushes as friends, but they are our guests, and we must treat them well,'' said Rolf-Peter Zimmer, a retired engineer and the president of the city parliament.
 More to the point, he said the publicity would attract tourists to Stralsund, a charming but economically fragile town of 58,000. Although it was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 2002, it has not been able to capitalize on its rich history as a trading port in the Hanseatic League, an alliance of merchants that controlled trade on the Baltic Sea in the late Middle Ages.
 People here are also giving the benefit of the doubt to Mrs. Merkel, a physicist-turned-politician who has represented this part of the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania in Parliament since shortly after German reunification. She keeps close ties to Stralsund, visiting every month. Some view Mr. Bush's trip as proof that she looks out for her constituents.
 Commentators have likened her invitation to the much coveted weekends for world leaders at the president's ranch in Crawford, Tex. Mrs. Merkel is even throwing a barbecue -- featuring a wild boar shot by a local hunter -- in a tiny village near here, Trinwillershagen.
 ''I think she is proud of Stralsund,'' said Birgid Wacks, the head of the tourist office. ''She'll be able explain to Bush what it was like during East German times and how it has changed since.''
 In fact, the few cobblestone blocks that Mr. Bush will see are more evocative of 14th-century commerce than 20th-century Communism. Handsome gabled houses, built by prosperous merchant families, line the streets. The drab concrete housing projects that blight this town, like most in eastern Germany, are built in outlying areas and are not on Mr. Bush's itinerary.
 Still, Stralsund carries the burdens of its history. The unemployment rate hovers above 20 percent, prompting young people to flee to western Germany for jobs. Their exodus, combined with a low birth rate, has resulted in a dearth of children. Stralsund has closed two schools recently.
 Mrs. Merkel won her seat as a Christian Democrat, and her party dominates the municipal government. But Mecklenburg-West Pomerania is governed by a coalition of Social Democrats and the Left Party, which includes elements of the old East German Communist Party. Ministers from the Left Party have said they will march in the protests against Mr. Bush.
 The protesters -- unhappy that Mrs. Merkel has pursued closer ties with the president -- plan to take aim at both leaders. Monty Schadel, a local organizer, noted that the German government had locked arms with the United States in the nuclear standoff with Iran -- a stance, he implied, that could lay the groundwork for another war. ''We're saying not only that they should stop waging wars, but that they should stop planning wars,'' Mr. Schadel said.
 Mr. Bush will probably not hear the message. Stralsund's old town is largely surrounded by water, and the police plan to block the few causeways leading into it. That will keep the protesters at a distance.
 Perhaps the hottest issue is the matter of who should pay for the visit. With 12,500 police officers deployed, security will cost more than $15 million, and German newspapers have reported that Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, one of Germany's poorest states, is to foot the bill. Mr. Zimmer said that the matter had not been decided yet and that the Left Party was exploiting it for political gain.
 As workers erected stands for pre-screened residents to greet Mr. Bush, nearby shopkeepers said they would close their doors on Thursday. But even they sounded more resigned than resentful.
 ''We can live with being closed for a day,'' said Sybille Riedel-Kotz, an antiques dealer. ''Very few people have ever heard of Stralsund. If Bush makes more people aware of it, then it's worth it.''

HEADLINE: White House Forecasts Drop in the Deficit 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said Tuesday that a big jump in tax revenue would reduce the budget deficit for this year to $296 billion, down from $318 billion in 2005. But budget analysts warned that the long-term fiscal outlook remained almost as bleak as before.
 Tax revenue is expected to climb 11 percent this year, totaling $246 billion more than in 2005. And while spending continues to rise rapidly, taxes on corporate profits and individual investment income have grown even faster. 
In its official ''midsession review'' of the budget, released Tuesday, the White House predicted that the deficit would decline for the second straight year. At $296 billion in the 2006 fiscal year, the shortfall would be almost one-third smaller than the record high of $412 billion, in 2004.
 ''Some in Washington say we had to choose between cutting taxes and cutting the deficit,'' President Bush said in a brief appearance at the White House to highlight the new estimates. ''Today's numbers show that that was a false choice. The economic growth fueled by tax relief has helped send our tax revenues soaring.''
 As a fraction of the size of the economy, a measure that economists consider more meaningful than absolute dollar amounts, the deficit this year is expected to be about 2.3 percent of gross domestic product. That is down from 3.6 percent in 2004 and roughly in line with levels over the last 30 years.
 But the government's overall fiscal health remains far worse than when Mr. Bush took office in 2001. Back then the government had run surpluses in four consecutive years, and forecasters were predicting trillions of dollars in surplus over the coming decade. 
 The government is now predicting deficits of more than $100 billion a year through 2011 and well over $1 trillion of new debt in the next decade. In addition, the administration's estimates omit costs of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond 2007, as well as the cost of preventing a huge expansion of the alternative minimum tax.
 That tax, created by Congress nearly four decades ago to prevent the very rich from paying little or no income tax, has been capturing an increasing number of taxpayers, largely because it is not indexed for inflation. Preventing a big further increase in the number of people affected by it would cost more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years.
 ''Politicians should keep the fiscal champagne bottles corked,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that lobbies for fiscal discipline.
 ''The real news here,'' Mr. Bixby said, ''is that even into our fifth year of economic recovery and with two years of very strong revenue growth, we will still have a deficit this year of almost $300 billion.''
 In his re-election campaign, Mr. Bush promised to cut the deficit in half by 2009, though that promise was based on a bloated 2004 deficit projection of $521 billion, which never materialized. The newest budget projections show the deficit down by half from its 2004 peak by the end of 2008.
 Many budget analysts say the real problem will be preparing for a huge rise in Social Security and Medicare costs as the baby-boom generation enters retirement. The oldest boomers become eligible for Social Security benefits in 2008, and the costs of old-age entitlement programs, already the biggest component of the federal budget, are expected to start climbing rapidly soon afterward.
 Further, Mr. Bush would make most of his tax cuts permanent rather than allow them to expire in 2010. If the cuts are extended, the government will be even more short of money after he leaves office.
 ''A five-year projection leaves the impression that the decline in the out-year deficit will be linear and will eventually reach balance,'' said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. ''But when all factors are considered, the long run is bleaker, and the midsession review offers no plan.''

HEADLINE: Bush Steps Up Effort to Focus on Strength of Economy 

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, July 11 

 BODY:
Blessed with a growing economy but facing voters who do not give him much credit for it, President Bush is intensifying efforts to persuade the public that things are looking up, with the aim of giving Republicans a boost in the midterm elections.
 In a barrage of public appearances over the past week -- a visit to a microelectronics company outside Chicago, the swearing in of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. on Monday, a White House speech on Tuesday morning pointing out a lower-than-expected deficit and a visit to a shoe factory near here on Tuesday afternoon -- Mr. Bush has been making the case that his tax cuts have brought jobs and prosperity to Americans. 
''Today is a good day for the American taxpayer,'' Mr. Bush said at the White House before flying here. 
 The president was announcing that this year's budget deficit would be $296 billion, as opposed to the earlier estimate of $423 billion. 
 ''Tax relief is working, the economy is growing, revenues are up, the deficits are down,'' Mr. Bush said, ''and all across this great land, Americans are realizing their dreams and building better futures for their families.''
 But some economists say that the picture is not all that rosy and that this is one reason Mr. Bush is not getting the customary bump in the polls from what his advisers call ''robust economic growth and job creation.'' 
 High gasoline prices, rising interest rates and unease over the war in Iraq are mostly to blame. 
 ''High-income households, wealthier households, are doing fabulously well, but lower-middle-income households are struggling,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Economy.com, a nonpartisan, independent subsidiary of Moody's, the credit rating agency. ''It really is a tale of two households, and I think President Bush is not going to gain traction on the economy as long as there is this wide disparity.'' 
 Mr. Bush and his aides say the president's tax cuts have spurred economic growth, resulting in increased federal revenue, which has led to the drop in the deficit. 
 ''People are personally pleased with their economic position but are anxious about the future,'' said Dan Bartlett, counselor to the president, calling the shoe factory visit ''a real-life example that our economy is growing and prospering.'' 
 The factory, Allen-Edmonds, specializes in high-quality men's dress shoes, including some owned by Mr. Bush. 
 By visiting, the president sought to draw attention to a company that has resisted industrywide pressure to move its operations overseas. 
 The company president, John Stollenwerk, gave Mr. Bush a pair of red, white and blue wingtip shoes, which the president promptly put on.
 Mr. Bush said Allen-Edmonds had benefited from his tax cuts, calling it ''an American-based company making good American products.''
 Later, the president attended a fund-raiser for Representative Mark Green, the Republican candidate for governor in Wisconsin, where he called for his tax cuts to be made permanent. 
 The president ticked off a litany of challenges his administration had faced: recession, corporate scandal, natural disaster and the war on terror. ''And yet,'' Mr. Bush said, ''this economy of ours is strong and we intend to keep it that way.'' 
 By standard measurements, the economy does look good: a 4.6 percent unemployment rate, 5.4 million new jobs since August 2003 and a gross domestic product that grew an average of 4 percent in the past three years.
 But a poll released last month by the Pew Research Center found that just 33 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, while 54 percent disapproved. And a June survey by the University of Michigan, which tracks consumer confidence in government economic policies, found that 39 percent said Mr. Bush was doing a poor job, while 13 percent said he was doing a good job, and 47 percent rated him as fair. 
 Aides to Mr. Bush say they believe that the economy is one of three issues that will be central to the midterm elections. But the other two -- Iraq and immigration -- are so much on voters' minds that some analysts say no matter how much Mr. Bush focuses on the economy, voters are unlikely to tune in. 
 In addition to Mr. Bush's appearances, other administration officials, including Rob Portman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Al Hubbard, director of the National Economic Council, were also giving interviews and making public appearances. 
 ''Obviously, it's frustrating to us that the American people don't recognize how well the economy is doing,'' Mr. Hubbard said.
 Congressional Republicans were quick to pick up on Mr. Bush's theme on Tuesday, but fiscal conservatives, an important part of the Republican base, were strongly critical of federal spending. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, an advocacy group that wants more fiscal restraint, said Mr. Bush was making a mistake by focusing on the deficit.
 ''The deficit is the wrong metric,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''No one has ever won or lost an election on the deficit.''

HEADLINE: Technology Shares Drag Markets Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
All three major American stock indexes lost more than 1 percent yesterday as Apple Computer and Dell suffered under the weight of negative analyst views, dragging down technology stocks and stoking concerns about the earnings season.
 ''Earnings and preannouncements have not been horrible, but the companies that have come out are all pointing to a softer second half,'' said Greg Palmer, head of equity trading at Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore.
The Nasdaq composite index sank 38.62 points, or 1.81 percent, to close at 2,090.24. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 121.59 points, or 1.09 percent, to end at 11,013.18. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 13.92 points, or 1.09 percent, to finish at 1,258.60. 
 Stocks extended losses after a government report showed United States oil supplies were lower than expected last week, adding to fears of continuing high crude prices and rising costs for businesses and consumers. Crude oil for August delivery gained 79 cents to settle at $74.95 a barrel in New York.
 Apple shares ended down 4.8 percent, or $2.69, at $52.96 after Credit Suisse said its profit and sales later this year might fall short as it cuts back on shipments of iPod digital music players before introducing the latest version.
 Dell shares declined 4.4 percent to close at $22.38 after UBS cut its price target to $24 from $26, saying the company continued to be affected by issues that adversely impacted sales and profits over the last year, and that checks indicated sales might be slowing further.
 Shares of Microsoft, a component of all three indexes, shed 2 percent, or 46 cents, to close at $22.64, after the European Union's regulators fined it about $357 million for defying a 2004 antitrust ruling. 
 Semiconductor stocks fell, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index declining 2.7 percent. Shares of Intel dropped 4.2 percent, or 79 cents, to close at $17.88. Intel was the biggest drag on the S.& P. 500, and it also helped pull the blue-chip Dow average lower.
 In the pharmaceutical sector, Genentech shares declined 3.7 percent, or $3.08, to $80.98 after it reported that sales growth of Avastin, its colon cancer drug, fell short of expectations.
 In contrast, Genzyme, another biotech company, reported second-quarter earnings above expectations, sending its stock up 8.2 percent, or $4.76, to close at $62.74.
 Shares of Brunswick, the boat maker, slid 7.2 percent, or $2.28, to close at $29.55 after the company cut its profit outlook. The news signaled potential profit problems for manufacturers of high-end goods.
 Earnings at S.& P. 500 companies are forecast to rise more than 9 percent in the second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. But investors have been growing more pessimistic after sales from the manufacturing bellwether Alcoa disappointed investors and after a warning from the data storage equipment maker EMC raised concerns about technology stocks.
 Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.48 billion shares changed hands, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On Nasdaq, about 1.86 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion.
 On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners exceeded advancers by a ratio of about seven to three. On Nasdaq, about three stocks fell for every one that rose.
 Prices of United States Treasuries were mostly lower or unchanged. The price of the benchmark 10-year note was unchanged, and the yield was at 5.10 percent.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Wins Its Appeal Over Abusive Tax Shelter

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
A federal appeals court handed a victory to the Internal Revenue Service yesterday in its war on questionable tax shelters, ruling that a shelter bought in 1996 by a former subsidiary of the Goodrich Corporation was abusive. 
 The case involving the Goodrich subsidiary, Coltec Industries, has been closely watched by tax lawyers and lobbyists as they argue over what constitutes an abusive shelter.
In the ruling, three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned a lower court's ruling in 2004, which said that Coltec was entitled to a $83 million refund from the I.R.S. stemming from its use of the shelter. That original ruling dealt a blow to I.R.S. efforts against abusive shelters. 
 Tax shelters like the one that Coltec bought through Arthur Andersen, were available in the last decade through large accounting firms. The shelter, known as a continent liability shelter, is intended to generate losses and was barred by the I.R.S. in 2001.
 Tax lawyers regard yesterday's ruling as significant because it addresses a disputed area known as the economic substance doctrine.
 Under the doctrine, which is not a formal part of the tax code, the I.R.S. considers invalid any shelter that follows the letter of the tax code, but violates its spirit by existing only to engineer tax losses. 
 In the ruling, the judges wrote that ''the law does not permit the taxpayer to reap tax benefits from a transaction that lacks economic reality'' and that ''a lack of economic substance is sufficient to disqualify the transaction without proof that the taxpayer's sole motive is tax avoidance.''
 Coltec, a maker of aerospace and industrial products that was bought by Goodrich in 2003, bought the shelter to protect itself from $375 million in asbestos-related liabilities. In 1996, through a series of transactions, Coltec shifted a $375 million promissory note to a subsidiary to insulate itself from the asbestos liabilities. 
 The subsidiary then sold $500,000 in stock -- most of its entire capitalization -- to investors. 
 On its federal income tax return for 1996, Coltec then claimed a loss of more than $375 million, arguing that the subsidiary's worth included the asbestos liabilities. The loss more than offset Coltec's taxable gains for the year.
 The I.R.S. disallowed the loss, and assessed Coltec a tax bill of nearly $83 million. In 2000, Coltec sued for a refund in the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington, where in 2004, Judge Susan G. Braden upheld Coltec's position and denied the I.R.S.'s position. The I.R.S. appealed the decision.
 Eileen J. O'Connor, an assistant attorney general, said in a statement yesterday that the latest ruling ''confirms that illusionary losses purportedly created by the so-called 'contingent liability' tax shelter are not deductible against actual taxable income.'' 
 The ruling is similar to one that the I.R.S. won involving Black & Decker.
 The economic substance doctrine has been a source of fierce debate among judges, lawyers and tax officials, with some of them arguing that it must be codified to prevent abusive tax shelters and others saying that it is hopelessly murky and unconstitutional.
 But a tax lawyer, E. Ray Beeman, said yesterday that the ruling might encourage lawmakers not to make the economic substance doctrine a formal part of the tax code in favor of letting the courts decide which shelters had substance.

HEADLINE: Disabilities No Barrier to the Entrepreneurial Spirit

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: WESTMINSTER, Md. 

 BODY:
Greg Prater loves stocking the vending machines he owns with cans of soft drinks, potato chips and other snacks. And his eyes sparkle when he opens the money box to empty the cascade of quarters, nickels and dimes into a plastic bucket. 
 The victim of an auto accident as a teenager, Mr. Prater, 40, has a brain injury that left him with cognitive and physical disabilities. But two and a half years ago, he began running his own small business, Greg's Vending Machines, and his sole proprietorship has been so successful that he recently won a state award.
 As traditional work for the disabled, which typically meant tasks like collating, boxing and mailing items for community businesses, began to dry up in the 1990's, many states like Maryland began to search for ways to help them become self-sufficient. Then in 2003, Maryland rehabilitative services decided to include people with more severe disabilities to see whether they could get them started in business.
 It worked so well with Mr. Prater, whose success inspired fellow disabled workers, that the program in June celebrated its first incorporation of individual businesses started by disabled entrepreneurs. Mr. Prater and two other men with serious disabilities signed papers the last week of June to incorporate as MAG Vending. 
 ''We're really happy about this,'' said Donald Rowe, assistant executive director at the Arc, in Carroll County Md., the nonprofit group that administers disabilities programs in Maryland, which like all states receives federal funding, largely from the Education Department. 
 ''This shows that, with a little help, people with cognitive and developmental disabilities can operate their own business,'' he said.
 Starting in 1996, Mr. Prater spent seven years in workshops packaging and labeling goods. He wound up at the Carroll County Arc, where he impressed Mr. Rowe, who has an M.B.A., with his entrepreneurial flare.
 ''When he wasn't working, he was busy selling gum to the staff and his fellow workers,'' Mr. Rowe recalled.
 In 2003, Maryland's Reach Independence Through Self-Employment, or RISE, program gave Mr. Prater an opportunity to realize his dream of becoming his own boss.
 One day recently, Mr. Prater, who has a ready smile, was unpacking cans and loading one of his five machines. He got a lift to the Carroll Nonprofit Center building in Westminster, Md., where he has a machine, from Earl Haines, a former newspaper delivery man who works at the Arc in Westminster. Mr. Haines helps Mr. Prater purchase, track and unpack inventory and visit his sites.
 Once a week, Mr. Haines also drives him to a nearby bank, where Mr. Prater brings his bucket, weighted down with coins, and watches as the teller totals his take and deposits the money in his account.
 ''To make money'' is what Mr. Prater says he likes best. He grosses around $15,000 a year, with about $6,000 in profit. He also receives Social Security disability payments, and is able to support himself in a subsidized apartment. 
 He sets aside money every month to plow back into his business to buy either new or used machines, which cost $1,500 to $5,000.
 Mr. Rowe coached him from the beginning and helped him draw up a business plan. Mr. Prater received a state grant to buy three machines, and has his accounting and taxes done by volunteers.
 Encouraging disabled people to join the ranks of entrepreneurs has become a goal of many states as traditional tasks, like the assembling and labeling that handicapped and disabled people had done for decades, evaporated as companies either outsourced the work or eliminated it.
 For the disabled, the flexibility of running a business can be crucial to working at all, and surviving economically. Maryland and Vermont have been among the state leaders in training and supporting the disabled in their own businesses. Maryland's RISE program for the more seriously disabled has helped about 1,500 people learn skills like bookkeeping and marketing.
 ''There has been a move towards greater independence, especially in helping the disabled run their own businesses,'' said Chris Privett, the spokesman for the Arc, formerly known as the Association for Retarded Citizens.
 Nationwide, more than five million Americans have a severe disability, according to Census Bureau figures. They have a 42 percent rate of employment.
 The severely disabled are also more likely to have health problems, to need Medicaid coverage, to receive welfare and to have a household income below $20,000, the Census Bureau reported.
 Ron Pagano, 53, of Pasadena, Md., who has degenerative arthritis as a result of inherited dwarfism, began his own business with the help of the RISE program.
 In the 1970's and 80's, Mr. Pagano sold life insurance, started an electronic parts distribution company and worked in estate planning services, but eventually his arthritis got so bad that some days he couldn't get out of bed, he said.
 He went on disability in 2000, and later the RISE program provided him with eight weeks of training to evaluate the demographics and finances for a Coffee News franchise. He submitted a business plan for Coffee News -- a one-page coffee-colored sheet that features human interest articles along with local advertising and is distributed to restaurants, coffee shops and motels -- and received a $15,000 start-up grant for his franchise in Howard County, Md. 
 Since his mobility is restricted, Mr. Pagano takes care of the inside jobs, including accounting and billing, as well as the layout, design and printing. His wife, Karen, who is not disabled, handles the marketing, the sales and the distribution to 180 locations weekly.
 So far, Mr. Pagano does not make enough -- he declined to say exactly how much -- to forgo federal disability and health care, but says, ''We're building something neat.''
 Without Maryland's program, he says, ''I'd be sitting here twiddling my thumbs.''
 Achieving self-sufficiency takes time, Mr. Rowe acknowledged. The RISE program ''is a pioneer project,'' he said. ''It's a big commitment, and it's expensive so we've had to take a long-term view.
 ''But it has changed the perception of what disabled people have the ability to do -- in a positive way.''
 Other states and localities also are helping the disabled to start their own businesses. The Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation was early in the field, offering entrepreneur training for nearly two decades.
 Fitzgerald Octave, for example, who developed glaucoma as a result of diabetes in 2002, wanted to start his own auto body shop. He took the Brooklyn program's three-month course to learn bookkeeping, cash flow management, marketing and other skills that he needed to start and maintain a business.
 ''The biggest lesson is to get contracts signed,'' he said, ''not to rely on a handshake.''
 Mr. Octave, 50, received a $15,000 grant to start FGO Motors in the Bronx. He is just getting started but says he has learned from his training that he has to generate his own business, so he is planning a Web site and radio and eventually television advertising to keep a steady flow of work.
 In Maryland, Mr. Prater's success, recognized in 2005 when he won the Maryland Disabled Small-Business Person of the Year award, inspired Adam Dunn, 30, of Eldersburg, and Matthew Adler, 24, of Taneytown, to learn about entrepreneurship. 
 Now Mr. Adler has four machines, including one at the high school he attended. And Mr. Dunn, who is a swimmer in the Special Olympics, also has four.
 Together, they are forming a vending company, called MAG -- after the first letter of their first names -- so they can get some economies of scale when purchasing their inventory, save on insurance and fill in for each other if one goes on vacation or has a problem.
 While they get help from Mr. Haines and other people at Arc, they say they enjoy the independence and self-sufficient feeling they get from running their own businesses.
 ''I'm the man,'' Mr. Prater said with a smile.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about people with disabilities who have become entrepreneurs rendered a phrase incorrectly in a quotation by Chris Privett, a spokesman for the Arc, who discussed efforts to encourage these small businesses. He said, ''There has been a move towards greater independence, especially in helping people with disabilities run their own businesses,'' not in helping ''the disabled.''

HEADLINE: It's Corn vs. Soybeans in a Biofuels Debate

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 12 

 BODY:
Biodiesel produced from soybeans produces more usable energy and reduces greenhouse gases more than corn-based ethanol, making it more deserving of subsidies, according to a study being published this month in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
 The study, done by researchers at the University of Minnesota and at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., points to the environmental benefits of the biodiesel over ethanol made from corn, stating that ethanol provides 25 percent more energy a gallon than is required for its production, while soybean biodiesel generates 93 percent more energy. 
The study's authors also found that ethanol, in its production and consumption, reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 12 percent, compared with fossil fuels. Biodiesel, they said, reduces such emissions 41 percent, compared with fossil fuels.
 The study concludes that the future of replacing oil and gas lies with cellulosic ethanol produced from low-cost materials like switch grass or wheat straw, if it is grown on agriculturally marginal land or from waste plant material.
 Indeed, the study published by the National Academy of Sciences found that neither ethanol nor biodiesel can replace much petroleum without having an impact on food supply. If all American corn and soybean production were dedicated to biofuels, that fuel would replace only 12 percent of gas demand and 6 percent of diesel demand, the study notes.
 Researchers at universities and at the United States Agriculture Department have debated ethanol's benefits as policy makers continue to struggle with how to respond to high gasoline prices and how to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. 
 Some lawmakers have urged an end to federal subsidies of 51 cents a gallon for ethanol refiners. The subsidies have helped create a boom in ethanol production and have made ethanol more profitable than ever.
 The researchers in the latest study question ethanol's environmental benefits, noting that despite the 12 percent reduction in greenhouse gases, ethanol has ''greater environmental and human health impacts because of increased release of five air pollutants and nitrate, nitrite and pesticides.'' 
 Neither biofuel was cost-competitive in 2005 without subsidies. Biodiesel cost 55 cents a liter to produce, or 20 percent more than ethanol. Wholesale gasoline prices in 2005 averaged 44 cents a liter, or 4 percent less a liter to produce than ethanol, the study said. Still, biodiesel receives a subsidy that is 45 percent greater a liter than ethanol.
 Analysts agreed with the study's conclusion that biodiesel compares favorably with ethanol from an environmental standpoint. ''Biodiesel is much cleaner-burning fuel and much less harmful to the environment,'' Daniel W. Basse, president of AgResource in Chicago, an economic forecasting firm, said Wednesday. 
 But Mr. Basse said ethanol production is far more efficient, with some 420 gallons of ethanol produced per acre of corn versus only 60 gallons of biodiesel per acre of soybeans. If biodiesel use ever increased greatly, Mr. Basse said, the cost of soybean oil would rise significantly.
 Brent Erickson, executive vice president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, based in Washington, agreed that biodiesel's potential was limited. ''If you look at the amount of biodiesel you can produce, it is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of cellulosic ethanol that could be produced one day,'' he said.
 The Minnesota researchers write that with a projected doubling of global demand for food within 50 years and an even greater expected increase in demand for transportation fuels, ''there is a great need for renewable energy supplies that do not cause significant harm and do not compete with food supply.''

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Up; Countertrends Are Seen 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit edged slightly higher in May, pushed up by soaring oil prices. But a surge in American exports helped keep the imbalance between exports and imports in check, suggesting that trade is starting to stabilize. 
 The Census Bureau said in a report yesterday that the difference between what Americans export and import grew to $63.8 billion in May, about $500 million more than in April. Though the deficit was not quite as large as many economists had forecast, it was still 13 percent larger than the $56.6 billion recorded in May 2005. 
 But economists noted that because energy prices exaggerated the overall deficit figure, the trade imbalance report was not as grim as it appeared at first glance. In fact, exports reached a record high. And when energy prices are removed from the trade gap calculation, the numbers suggest the imbalance is actually leveling off.
 Imports of crude oil jumped by 17 percent in value in May, or $2.8 billion. Oil prices climbed $4.92 a barrel, the largest month-to-month increase the Census Bureau has recorded since 1990. The surge in oil prices overshadowed a healthy gain in American exports, which reached a record level of $118.7 billion.
 Exports of industrial materials like metals and plastics rose, as did exports of civilian aircraft, a more volatile sector but one that contributes heavily to trade figures.
 ''The underlying trend seems to be toward stabilization,'' Stephen Stanley, chief economist with RBS Greenwich Capital, said, noting that exports have been on the rise in recent months. ''If we ever saw a sustained period of steady energy prices, I think we'd see at least stabilization, perhaps a little improvement in the trade deficit.'' 
 The Census Bureau report also showed that the ever-expanding trade deficit with China, which many American politicians contend is a function of China's undervalued currency, grew by 4 percent in May, reaching $17.7 billion. China has an increasingly one-sided trade relationship with the rest of the world as well: on Monday it reported an overall surplus of $14.5 billion for June, its largest on record.
 Economists have warned that for both countries, such large imbalances are unsustainable. ''We're both dancing on the Titanic here,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''Still, it took a long time for the Titanic to sink.''
 Many economists see the American trade imbalance moderating along with the economy, meaning that for the first time in two years, the steadily growing gap between imports and exports could begin to stabilize. If growth slows, as most economists predict it will, Americans will make fewer purchases, and demand for foreign goods will shrink. At the same time, higher gas prices could cause Americans to cut back on gasoline consumption.
 ''We are really shipping money out of this country hand over fist,'' said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers. ''And I don't know how long you can keep spending this kind of money without ultimately there being significant adjustments.''
 But in last month's trade report, there were no signs that demand for oil was on the decline. The number of barrels of oil imported each day hit 10.4 million, the highest level since October. 
 Another factor that could help contain the trade deficit is growth overseas. 
 ''With slower U.S. growth and the rest of the world carrying on pretty much as it was, the trend for the U.S. trade deficit does look better,'' said Simon Hayley, senior international economist for Capital Economics.

HEADLINE: Bedeviled by Problems in the U.S., BP Installs a Mr. Fix-It

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Last week, just days after he officially took on a new assignment to run BP's business in the United States, Robert A. Malone took off for the Alaskan tundra to visit one of the hottest of the several hot spots in the global oil company's increasingly troubled North American portfolio.
 And that's only the beginning of the traveling across the country he will have to do.
 A native of Texas and a 32-year company veteran who until recently oversaw BP's worldwide fleet of tankers, Mr. Malone was tapped to run BP America Inc., the nation's largest oil and gas producer. The subsidiary, built around acquisitions like Amoco, has been rocked by a series of lapses and accidents over the last 15 months that have tarnished the company's reputation. 
 The troubles include the worst oil spill on the North Slope of Alaska; an explosion at BP's largest refinery, which killed 15 workers in Texas City, Tex.; the near loss of a $1 billion offshore platform; and most recently, accusations that BP traders manipulated the propane market. 
 While he was not responsible for the problems, Mr. Malone will have to answer criticism that BP neglected basic safety rules, fostered a culture of excessive risk-taking and failed to invest enough in critical infrastructure. He also faces the challenge of restoring BP's credibility not just with the public but also with regulators from the Justice Department and the Labor Department, among others.
 The misfortunes already have led to lengthy delays in production, hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs and settlements, and civil and criminal investigations by state and federal agencies. The paradox is that BP -- known for navigating successfully in much more challenging places like Siberia, the Caspian and Africa -- has faltered in the most open of economic environments.
 Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company in New York, said BP had a ''streak of bad luck'' but the company still enjoyed a solid reputation around the world. In the United States, though, ''BP has this black cat that just keeps crossing its path -- back and forth.''
 To be sure, BP is logging record profits these days, posting net income last year of $22.34 billion, up 31 percent from 2004. It returned more than half -- $12 billion -- to shareholders in the first half of 2006 in dividends and stock buybacks. Shares of BP rose 10 percent in 2005, and are up another 10 percent this year.
 Mr. Malone, a 54-year-old self-described extrovert, needs to bring a great deal of tact and urgency to his new job. The company's slip in the United States is a setback for his boss, Lord Browne, BP's chief executive, who once managed the business in America. 
 If not dealt with, the missteps threaten to undermine Lord Browne's long efforts to give BP an environmentally friendly face and to deflect from BP some of the public's hostile attitude toward the oil industry. Analysts say the recent events have chipped away at this carefully crafted image, at least in the United States.
 ''I am concerned that there are people questioning in various areas those values,'' Mr. Malone said in a phone interview yesterday. ''Part of what I want to do is address these issues. They are real and they are serious to BP America.'' 
 Earlier this month, the company said that its second-quarter production had fallen 2.5 percent from the period last year, to four million barrels a day of oil equivalent, its fourth consecutive quarterly decline. Also, BP said it would take a further $500 million charge for compensation claims for the Texas City blast, in addition to the $700 million it set aside last year.
 The United States accounts for nearly half the company's global sales, half the company's total assets and, with 40,000 workers, about half its employees. In turn, BP is a big player in America, accounting for 10 percent of this country's oil output; its operations in the United States are bigger than those of Exxon Mobil, which is still much larger worldwide. 
 In many ways, BP's changing of the guard in the United States is a public admission of its problems here. Mr. Malone's predecessor in the United States, Ross Pillari, a 55-year-old executive for both North and South America, retired on July 1 after 34 years at BP. 
 ''The United States has been BP's weak spot, both in terms of its safety record and on poor maintenance issues,'' said Lanny Pendill, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ''There's also been a lack of oversight.''
 The company, however, denied that Mr. Pillari's retirement was related to the recent misfortunes. Mr. Malone's strong safety record may have played a role in his appointment. In London, he oversaw BP's oil and natural gas tanker shipments, a high-risk business that cannot afford accidents. During his tenure, BP shifted away from relying on chartered vessels and bought 48 double-hulled tankers. After the near collapse of the Thunder Horse offshore platform, he took over responsibility for all of BP's floating structures in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Before that, Mr. Malone was BP's man running the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline. Mr. Malone brings ''a proven record of success in the companies he has led,'' Lord Browne said in a statement issued by the company. 
 Mr. Malone, who says ''my priority is around safety,'' will visit BP's five refineries, starting with Texas City, in the next few weeks. He plans to return to the site of the oil spill in Alaska in two weeks and expects to drop in on all the company's major plants within three months.
 ''I like to get out with employees,'' he said. ''I need to see things for myself.''
 In his new job, Mr. Malone will have to manage the company's latest stumble -- federal authorities charged late last month that BP manipulated the price of propane two years ago by cornering the market through its dominant position.
 The scam was short-lived, and the traders lost $10 million. But the allegations hit at the heart of the company's sizable and very lucrative trading business. BP disputes the charges. 
 In Texas City, BP faces criminal charges after an explosion in March 2005 at its refinery, the third-biggest in the United States, killed 15 workers and injured 180. A preliminary investigation found ''systemic lapses in safety culture'' at the refinery, which had a long history of accidents and management slip-ups.
 BP swiftly accepted responsibility for the accident. Lord Browne visited the site the morning after the blast, replaced the plant's manager and approved about $1 billion in new investments in repairs and safety improvements. BP said it also quickly settled with the families of the dead and injured workers. Still, the company was fined $21.3 million.
 A federal agency investigating the blast has not ruled out interviewing Lord Browne before releasing a final report by the end of the year. Earlier this year, the company was fined $2.4 million for ''unsafe operations'' at another refinery in Toledo, Ohio. BP is contesting that fine.
 ''It is difficult to say if this is a BP-wide issue,'' said Craig Pennington, the director of the global energy group at Schroders in London. ''But they appear to cut corners for the sake of short-term profit maximization. If you are a serial underspender in a refinery, it will come back to haunt you.''
 Just three months after the refinery accident, after Hurricane Dennis swept through the Gulf of Mexico, Thunder Horse -- a huge new offshore platform that was about to start production -- began tilting into the waters, listing at a 20-degree angle. The company blames a failure in the platform's hydraulic system. 
 One year later, Thunder Horse remains hobbled with problems. The company, which spent $250 million in repairs, expects production to restart by the end of the year. But analysts suspect that a recent admission that two subsea manifolds were found to be leaking might further delay the start of production. 
 Mr. Malone also must contend with criminal charges against BP in connection with the large oil slick that spread across the Alaskan tundra in March, after a corroded pipeline operated by BP broke and spilled about 4,800 barrels, or about 200,000 gallons, of crude oil. Its local subsidiary, BP Exploration Alaska, had been fined several times in earlier cases, most recently $1.2 million in 2004. Now, the federal Department of Transportation, responsible for pipeline safety, is looking into the company's maintenance practices.
 The company strongly denies it has skimped on maintenance and said it increased the number of inspections in recent years.
 Yet the pipeline problem in Alaska echoes a chorus of complaints lodged against BP in recent years over the construction of a major pipeline linking the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in Turkey.
 BP is being investigated by the Environmental Protection Agency for violations of air pollution rules, by the Labor Department for unsafe work practices, and by the federal Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board for its industrial safety practices. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department are looking into the trading allegations.
 While BP is cooperating with all these investigations, it strongly rejects any suggestion that it has a companywide problem. ''These are unrelated incidents,'' said Ronnie Chappell, a BP spokesman. 
 BP has had a large presence in North America since the 1970's. But the company's big push came with Lord Browne's purchase of Amoco in 1998 for $52 billion, at the time the largest-ever merger in the oil industry. In 2000, BP bought another American company, Atlantic Richfield, for $26.8 billion. 
 But along with the assets, BP also inherited the problems. ''There is a lot on their plate that they need to sort out,'' Mr. Pennington said. Meanwhile, he added, ''it's all incredibly embarrassing for them.''

HEADLINE: Fast Growth In Economy After 9/11

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City's economy bounced back after Sept. 11 with surprising speed and is much healthier now than its slow-growing job market indicates, according to a report released yesterday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 Labor market data shows that there are 100,000 fewer private-sector jobs in the city than there were five years ago. But the report, which offers an analysis of the economic effects of 9/11 over the past five years, showed that the city has been recovering at least as fast as the nation by other measures. Most notably, average incomes have been rising faster for city residents than for other Americans, it states. 
 The report's authors also concluded that the economic effects of the terrorist attacks were sharp but short-lived and had largely disappeared by the end of 2002. In the first months after the attacks, some analysts had predicted that the damage to the economy would be permanent. 
 Indeed, the report noted, the bursting of the stock market bubble of the late 1990's has had a more lasting effect on the city's job market. 
 ''People keep asking, why are we 100,000 short of this last peak?'' said Jason Bram, a Fed economist and a co-author of the report. ''What's surprising is not how low it is now, but how high it was in 2001.''
 Mr. Bram said that at the rate the city was creating jobs, it would take another 18 months to recover the rest of the 225,000 jobs lost between early 2001 and the second half of 2003. But he said his analysis showed that the job market was no weaker now than it would have been had the attacks never happened.
 ''We still would have had pretty big job losses, owing to a national recession and a couple of key industries like new media and dot-coms and the financial sector taking a big hit,'' Mr. Bram said. 
 Other analysts, however, were less sanguine about the strength of the city's rebound. A recovery that does not replace the jobs lost in a recession is not cause for much celebration, they said.
 ''It's a little bit startling and also depressing when you try to measure an economy and forget about job growth,'' said Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization. ''When you forget about job growth, you are forgetting about opportunity for all in a city like this.''
 James A. Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal watchdog group, said most of the income gains have gone to wealthier residents, and have not been shared by the typical city worker. He said that the average overall income increase masks the fact that hourly wages of most residents have been declining since 2002, when adjusted for inflation.
 ''If you look at family costs and energy costs and the cost of health care, I'd be hard-pressed to make the case that real living standards are rising for average New Yorkers,'' Mr. Parrott said. ''The polarization trend if anything is more pronounced in New York City than it is nationwide.''
 The Fed report's conclusions also run counter to some other studies of the effect of Sept. 11, including one published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics two years ago. Many of the high-paying jobs in finance, technology and professional services that were lost immediately after the attacks had not been recovered by the end of 2002, said Michael Dolfman, the regional commissioner of labor statistics.
 The big financial services firms in Manhattan sent tens of thousands of jobs out of the city in the fall of 2001 and many did not return. But with their profits rising rapidly to new highs, those firms are again filling high-paying positions in Manhattan and contributing to the recovery of the city's job market in the past two years. 
 In May, New York City's unemployment rate dropped to 5 percent, its lowest level in nearly 18 years. Mr. Bram said that if measured by the number of city residents with jobs, which is derived from a different survey than the payroll estimate, the city's economic health appears even rosier, with household employment surpassing both the pre-9/11 peak and the previous high mark reached in 1969. The number of city residents with jobs rose above 3.6 million in May.
 One explanation for the discrepancy between those two types of employment measures, he said, is that significantly more city residents are ''reverse commuting'' to jobs in the suburbs.
 ''This still is such a Manhattan-centric economy but less so than in the past,'' Mr. Bram said.
 Indeed, New York City accounts for only about 2.7 percent of the nation's private-sector jobs now, down from about 3.3 percent in 1989, Mr. Bram said. But those New York jobs pay considerably better on average than the national norm. He said the ''New York City premium'' -- the difference between the average wages in the city and in the nation -- was about 63 percent now, compared with about 20 percent in 1980, and almost 68 percent in 2001.
 Mr. Bram acknowledged that other economists and analysts ''have this perception that all the growth is in the high end.'' But he said he believed a lot of the job losses had been incurred in low-paying industries like apparel and other manufacturing and that much of the gains had come in the middle of the job spectrum, especially among the self-employed and small businesses.

HEADLINE: Earning That Congressional Raise 

 BODY:
Congress has just chopped a week off what already is a notoriously skimpy work calendar so that lawmakers will have extra campaign time at home this fall. The Capitol will recess at the end of September, leaving a world of unfinished business. You'll be relieved to know, however, that among the House items already seen to was a pay increase -- 2 percent over the current base salary of $168,500. 
 Pay raises are a classic bit of passive-aggressive legislative behavior in Washington: they're automatic, unless Congress takes a vote to block them. In the past 16 years, the two houses have passively accepted 11 of the cost-of-living raises while actively rejecting five.
Although we have always believed that lawmakers should draw decent salaries, it is hard to have patience with a body that allows its own pay to rise automatically while systematically stonewalling any increase in the national minimum wage. The private-sector workers who need a pay raise the most have been waiting nine years and counting for some kind of increase to offset the rising cost of living. But there has been no sign of mercy yet from the Republican leaders. They warn of raising ''the first rung of the economic ladder'' beyond a noble striver's reach -- as if that rung is securely anchored at $5.15 an hour.
 For a family of three, the minimum wage of $10,700, set in 1997, is now more than $5,000 below the federal definition of poverty. In that same time, a lawmaker's salary rose $31,600-- better than 20 percent -- while the purchasing power of a minimum-wage earner deteriorated by 20 percent. 
 Is it fair to make comparisons between working poor in the private sector and the lawmakers with power over their salaries? Congress would be wise to face that question before voters do. House leaders have thus far ducked it in blocking floor votes on the minimum wage (with no comparable hesitation about a tax break for estates left by the wealthy). 
 A rise in the minimum wage to $7.25 did get to the Senate floor, but fell short. Democrats vow to fight the Congressional raise unless poor workers finally get a boost. This is a debate well worth having before members of Congress hurry off to brag to voters of the job they've done.

HEADLINE: Wide Flaws Found in Boston's Tunnel System After a Deadly Accident

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK; Katie Zezima contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 12 

 BODY:
Massachusetts officials on Wednesday ordered every road and tunnel in the city highway system examined after inspectors found at least 60 more trouble spots in the Big Dig tunnel where a woman was crushed to death on Monday by three-ton ceiling tiles. 
 Michael Lewis, the project director for the Big Dig, said bolts appeared to be loose, that gaps existed or that other parts of the ceiling system seemed ''compromised'' in at least 60 places in the tunnel.
In addition, the Massachusetts attorney general said that problems with ceiling anchor bolts in the tunnel had been identified in 1999, when the ceiling was built, and that his office was investigating to see whether a plan to correct those problems was carried out.
 ''This is a massive failure, far beyond the events of Monday night,'' said the attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly. 
 Mr. Reilly, a Democratic candidate for governor, said that as investigators examined the ceiling tiles that were being removed for inspection ''you can visually see some of these problems, you can see some loosening of those anchor bolts, and you can see some anchor bolt systems in places where they are not designed to be.''
 Matthew J. Amorello, chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, ordered an evaluation of the entire highway system in the Boston area, even roads and tunnels that are not part of the Big Dig.
 Mr. Amorello said the tunnel where the accident occurred would remain closed until inspectors could figure out how to ''make sure that this event never happens again.''
 The tunnel, known as the Interstate 90 connector because it links the Massachusetts Turnpike and Interstate 93 with the Ted Williams Tunnel, is a major route to Logan International Airport. The part of the Ted Williams Tunnel that leads from the airport was reopened Wednesday, and traffic was diverted entirely around the connector. 
 Wednesday's disclosures further unraveled confidence in the safety and management of the Big Dig, the country's largest highway project, which took 15 years and $14.6 billion to complete. The recently finished project, which buried Boston's central highway, has been plagued by reports of leaks and flaws in slurry walls, cost overruns and other problems. In May, federal charges were filed against six current and former employees of a concrete supplier, who were accused of fraudulently concealing that some concrete was of poor quality.
 The accident Monday night killed Milena Del Valle, 38, a restaurant worker from Boston who was on the way to the airport with her husband, Angel. Mr. Del Valle, who was driving, managed to climb out a 12-inch window opening, but was unable to pull his wife from the car.
 Mr. Amorello said the concrete tiles formed a drop ceiling and were attached to the roof of the tunnel with metal tiebacks. The tiebacks were affixed to the roof with bolts and epoxy glue. One of the tiebacks detached, causing a section of five three-ton tiles to crash down on the Del Valles's car.
 Numerous investigations are under way, including by the United States attorney and the Massachusetts State Police. Mr. Reilly said he had sent subpoenas to the Big Dig project manager, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, as well as to the contractor on the connector, Modern Continental, and to the turnpike authority and the tunnel's design firm. 
 Bechtel and Modern Continental officials declined to comment Wednesday. On Tuesday, Bechtel issued a statement saying it was ''working closely'' with the turnpike authority ''to help determine the cause of this tragic accident.'' Modern Continental said Tuesday that it was ''confident that our work fully complied with the plans and specifications.''
 Mr. Reilly's investigation, which could lead to criminal charges, appears to focus on the installation and design of the tieback system. Using a pen to represent a tieback, Mr. Reilly said at a news conference, ''I can tell you this was a clean break. This is the rod. This came straight down. The concrete was not pulled away from those holes.''
 Asked what he thought went wrong, he said, ''Whether it's the epoxy, whether it's the plate, whether it's the bolts, I can't tell you right now.''
 Mr. Reilly said documents showed that in 1999, ''there were about five bolts that came out under testing.''
 ''There was a plan to address this situation.'' he said. ''We're trying to find out right now, Was that plan implemented?''
 Mariellen Burns, a turnpike authority spokeswoman, declined to comment on the 1999 documents late Wednesday, except to say that Mr. Amorello was not at the agency then.
 Gov. Mitt Romney, a longtime critic of Mr. Amorello, has complained of his own lack of control over the turnpike authority, a quasipublic agency. Mr. Romney said Tuesday that he was taking steps to fire Mr. Amorello, which will probably require a court hearing. In a news conference earlier Wednesday, Mr. Amorello restated that he did not plan to step down, insisting that the tunnel system was safe.
 Still, Mr. Amorello and Mr. Lewis, the project director, said that in addition to the 60 problem spots that were found in the eastbound side of the connector tunnel, trouble spots probably existed in the westbound lane, as well, and in the eastbound high-occupancy-vehicle lane. Inspectors are working to identify those problems, they said.
 Mr. Lewis described the 60 spots as ''individual locations where the threaded bolts were used, where something appears to have pulled out and there is somewhat of a gap between the ceiling.''
 Most parts of the Big Dig tunnels use a different tieback system, where the rods are not bolted and glued to the ceiling, but are anchored to a metal railing that is embedded in the roof, Mr. Amorello said.
 One expert on engineering failures, Stephen Banzaert, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, cautioned against jumping to conclusions.
 ''Anything is built with an assumption that some part of it can fail,'' Professor Banzaert said. ''Typically these things are overengineered to the point that they assume that you're going to get a bad batch of epoxy every once in a while'' or that a certain number of bolts each year will need to be replaced.
 ''The thing that would be really scary for me is if it turns out that everything was holding fine and all of a sudden they lost one bolt and the thing crashed down,'' he said.
 Finding a number of loose bolts could suggest that the solution is relatively simple: replace the bolts more often. 
 ''It's horrible,'' Professor Banzaert said. ''But if what comes out of this is you find out that their predictions on replacement time on these tiebacks were way off the mark, in theory they can just sort of recalibrate their maintenance schedule and everything will be fine.''
 But Ms. Burns, when asked if 60 problem spots should be considered a lot, replied: ''If you told us there were two areas of concern, we would think it was a lot. It's completely unacceptable. It's a public safety issue.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 14, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about flaws found in Boston's Big Dig tunnel system misidentified Stephen Banzaert, an engineering expert who cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the project's safety after a fallen ceiling tile crushed a woman on Monday. He is an instructor, not a professor, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 The caption about snarled traffic omitted the location. It was Storrow Drive.

HEADLINE: At U.N., China and Russia Offer A New Measure on North Korea

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE and JOSEPH KAHN; Warren Hoge reported from the United Nations for this article, and Joseph Kahn from Beijing.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 12 

 BODY:
China and Russia introduced a draft resolution on North Korea in the Security Council on Wednesday and asked the Council's members to consider it in place of a Japanese-sponsored resolution, to which they both have objected, that would have allowed for military enforcement and sanctions.
 In offering the new measure, Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said he had instructions from his government to veto the Japanese resolution if it were put to a vote. 
Japan and its resolution's co-sponsors, Britain, France and the United States, have been putting off a vote this week at the request of China, which said action by the Council would interfere with a Chinese diplomatic mission now in North Korea.
 In Beijing, an American official praised China's diplomatic efforts and called for a unified response to North Korea's missile tests, but it was clear that fissures between the main Asian powers had overshadowed any common stance that might put pressure on North Korea.
 Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, held talks in Beijing but prepared to return to Washington on Thursday morning without any sign that North Korea was prepared to return to six-nation disarmament talks. He called North Korea's stance ''discouraging.''
 The new Chinese-Russian draft resolution covers many of the same demands on North Korea that the Japanese-drafted measure does, but it significantly does so without resorting to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which would allow for military enforcement, and without proposing sanctions against North Korea for noncompliance.
 China and Russia had opposed those aspects of the original measure, saying they would destabilize the region and be viewed by North Korea as a provocation.
 The text of the Chinese-Russian resolution ''strongly deplores'' last week's North Korean tests, calls on member states to work to prevent North Korea from receiving or selling missile-related items and ''strongly urges'' it to return without precondition to the six-nation talks.
 Kenzo Oshima, the Japanese ambassador, said his government needed time to judge the new text. ''But a quick glance at the text shows there are very serious gaps on very important issues,'' he said. He did not specify them.
 John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said the United States still backed the Japanese resolution but welcomed the new measure because it was in the form of a resolution rather than a nonbinding presidential statement that the Chinese and Russians had earlier insisted was sufficient.
 He said it ''puts us on an apples-to-apples and oranges-to-oranges basis and now we can talk about a resolution, which is the appropriate measure through which the Security Council should act.''
 China, which has engaged in intensive talks with North Korea in recent days, said sanctions imposed on North Korea last fall by the United States Treasury Department must be lifted before North Korea would resume discussions about its weapons programs. ''We hope the U.S. can take measures to help the six-nation talks resume by compromising on the sanctions,'' said Liu Jianchao, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman. ''We don't want to see this impasse drag on forever.''
 The Treasury Department in October seized the American assets of eight North Korean companies it accused of helping proliferate weapons and imposed sanctions on Banco Delta Asia of Macao, accused of helping to launder North Korean money.
 Mr. Hill, speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, reiterated the Bush administration's position that financial sanctions would not be eased until North Korea stopped its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs and ended efforts to counterfeit American currency.
 ''We have a country that seems to be more interested in missiles than providing electricity or food for its people,'' he said. ''We are looking for ways to prevent'' North Korea ''from financing these activities, and frankly that's what we should be doing.''
 The six-nation talks reached a preliminary accord calling for North Korean nuclear disarmament last September but have since foundered, with North Korea declining to participate in multilateral discussions while the United States imposes sanctions. Japan, South Korea and Russia are also involved in the talks.
 China's call to ease financial sanctions suggests that it is still occupying the middle ground between the United States and North Korea, or even tilting slightly toward North Korea despite its missile tests.
 North Korea defied appeals from China as well as the United States and other major powers when it test-fired the seven missiles last week. 
 Bush administration officials clearly hoped that the tests, which appeared to come as a surprise to China, would prompt it to take a much tougher approach to North Korea, its Communist ally and neighbor. So far, however, China appears to be sticking to its role as honest broker, hoping to maintain close relations with both parties and pushing them toward direct talks.

HEADLINE: Out of College, But Now Living In Urban Dorms

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
Kelly Frances Cook is an editorial assistant, Ivy League graduate, aspiring writer -- the kind of new arrival who has long been important to the life of New York City. Young, educated and hailing from elsewhere, newcomers like Ms. Cook have historically stoked the city's intellectual and creative fires. But, these days, how do they afford a place to live?
 Ms. Cook, age 24 and from Ohio, at first could afford only a rented room in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., for $650 a month. Then she embarked on the archetypal, hair-raising New York City apartment search: feckless would-be roommates, outlandish financial demands, an offer of a room in a building with a bullet-pocked lobby.
Then she saw an ad on Craigslist for space in a 60-unit building in Harlem described as full of young professionals. The price was right; the woman on the phone was friendly. Back in Ohio, Ms. Cook's mother had begun to think like a New Yorker: ''Yeah, right, Kelly. She's probably some mass murderer. I don't trust her. She's too nice.'' 
 This month, Ms. Cook is moving in. The woman on the phone, Karen Falcon (not a mass murderer), calls the building ''a dorm for adults.'' It is a community of the overeducated and underpaid.
 There is nothing new about having roommates in New York City. What Ms. Falcon has invented is a full-service dorm, full of strangers she has brought together to share big apartments as a way to keep housing costs down. Her approach is a homegrown response to the soaring rents bedeviling desirable cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
 Ms. Falcon, an informal agent for the building's owner, says she has placed nearly 150 young people there and in two other buildings in the neighborhood in recent years. A gregarious Californian with rainbow-colored braids, she pieces together roommate groups like puzzles. Each tenant ends up paying $700 to $1,200 a month.
 Ms. Falcon says she screens for a combination of good credit ratings and ''sweetness,'' looking for people who are respectful, considerate and easygoing (and perhaps have a co-signer).
 She mixes genders; all-female groups bring too much high drama, all-male groups make too much of a mess. She has matched Ph.D.'s with Ph.D.'s. If the combination is a disaster, she will arrange for a swap. Anyone can leave before the lease is up as long as Ms. Falcon can find a replacement. 
 She says the tenants she has placed in the three buildings have included chefs, actors, writers, people in publishing, a woman in public relations, a production manager, an accountant, a paralegal, a program officer for a foundation. There have also been plenty of graduate students and students from abroad.
 ''Our neighborhood is one of the last neighborhoods left in New York where you have these big old Beaux-Arts buildings, built for wealthy families,'' Ms. Falcon said, referring to the stretch of Harlem from 145th to 155th Streets near the Hudson River. She said groups of adults, each contributing, pay rents that families cannot or choose not to pay.
 New York City has long been a magnet for the young, well educated and ambitious. According to a report published by the Census Bureau in 2003, nearly 132,500 young, single, college-educated people poured into the New York metropolitan area between 1995 and 2000, more than into any other metropolitan area in the United States.
 ''Sometimes we underestimate how important that is in generating the city's creativity,'' said Frank Braconi, chief economist for the city comptroller's office. ''To the degree that housing costs become a barrier to that group, it can in the long run sap us of that creative potential that we would otherwise have.''
 Brad Lander, director of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a nonprofit group, said young professionals get less attention than other financially struggling groups because they are more mobile and have options. Though they, too, are wrestling with the city's shortage of lower-cost housing, they are seen as harbingers of gentrification.
 Mr. Lander said a well-known strategy among landlords of buildings with rents regulated by the city is to seek out tenants who they imagine will not stay long, because they can often increase the rent when a tenant leaves. ''Students as well as professionals,'' he said. ''Plenty of landlords find this group an attractive set of folks to rent to, believing they'll be out in a couple of years.''
 Marieke Bianchi, 23, a junior account executive at a public relations firm in the Flatiron district, moved to New York from St. Louis last year after graduating from college. She started out on a friend's couch, then sublet for six weeks in Hell's Kitchen, where she had to move a giant exercise bike to get into bed.
 ''I can't believe it, a grown woman in a trundle bed,'' she said with humorous disgust.
 Ms. Bianchi, earning $25,000 a year at the time, found one of Ms. Falcon's ads. Now she lives in a large room in a four-bedroom duplex apartment in a brownstone in Harlem. Her roommates are a bartender, a woman in information technology, an art historian, two dogs and two cats. Her rent is $900 a month.
 Adult dorm living is not without its complexities. 
 Ms. Bianchi feels she should check first before inviting friends into the backyard, since they have to pass through another roommate's space. And when one of her roommates brings anyone home for the night, Ms. Bianchi invariably knows. ''It's that level of intimacy from Day 1,'' she said.
 Like Ms. Bianchi, others ponder their next move.
 Wil Fenn, a 29-year-old program officer for a foundation, has been trying since college to save money to buy a home. He lived in Westchester County for six years, in order to pay less rent. Then, last year, he became bored and decided to move into Manhattan. He, too, happened upon one of Ms. Falcon's ads.
 Now Mr. Fenn pays $850 a month for a large room in a four-bedroom apartment in what he describes as a beautiful building with exposed brick walls, mosaic tiles in the lobby and a garden on the roof. His roommates include a New York City teaching fellow, a chef and a German student studying in the United States on a Fulbright scholarship.
 Ms. Falcon first placed Mr. Fenn in a two-bedroom apartment with a woman who he said worked for a large bond firm. One night, Mr. Fenn said, she had a fit after he left his mail on top of the microwave oven. It was downhill from there. So, at his request, Ms. Falcon moved him down to the four-bedroom apartment on the second floor.
 ''Everyone talks about free-market solutions,'' he said, speaking of the city's shortage of lower-priced housing. ''But the solution now is the rich get richer and for everyone else it's the equivalent of being a sharecropper in the city. I've been working five or six years now, trying to save up and buy something. Every time I get closer, the goal moves farther away.''
 Asked how adult-dorm life differed from college-dorm life, Mr. Fenn said: ''You're not really at the same place where you were psychologically. Now, for me, I'm kind of wondering: When does this end? When do I get to be able to buy a place and settle down?''

HEADLINE: Russia and China, in Shift, Inch Toward Iran Sanctions

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Elaine Sciolino contributed reporting from Paris for this article, Warren Hoge from the United Nations, and Nazila Fathi from Tehran.

DATELINE: PARIS, July 12 

 BODY:
Russia and China, crossing a diplomatic threshold in the effort to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, joined the United States and Europe on Wednesday by agreeing to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution ordering Iran to freeze some nuclear activities, or face sanctions. 
 The movement toward a resolution represented increased anger over Iran's refusal to respond to an offer of economic and energy incentives if it suspended its uranium enrichment. 
Though punitive sanctions are in no way certain, agreeing to start down a road that could lead to them is a huge step for Moscow and Beijing, commercial partners of Tehran that have long resisted attempts by the United States and Europe to punish Iran at the United Nations. 
 For the past five weeks, the biggest question on the incentives, presented to Iran in June, has been whether the fragile coalition of six countries making the offer would pursue sanctions if Iran refused to accept. 
 After a two-and-a-half-hour meeting of foreign ministers on Wednesday at the ornate Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris, the answer seemed clear -- for now at least. 
 ''The Iranians have given no indication at all that they are ready to engage seriously on the substance of our proposals,'' Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said in a terse statement on behalf of the group, which includes Germany and Britain. ''We express profound disappointment over this situation.''
 The group agreed to seek a Security Council resolution that would make suspension of enrichment mandatory. ''Should Iran refuse to comply,'' the statement added, ''then we will work for the adoption of measures'' under an article of the United Nations Charter that allows for nonmilitary punitive sanctions.
 Bush administration officials characterized the statement as a victory, particularly for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's gamble that she could get China and Russia to proceed on a diplomatic path that could result in sanctions if the United States first made Iran a strong offer of incentives. American and European officials said Iran, by refusing to accept or reject the offer, might have miscalculated its support from Russia and China. 
 ''This is a significant decision that frankly reflects the disappointment and frustration of our countries by the lack of a serious response from the Iranian government,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs. ''Iran has given us no choice.''
 That said, it is far from certain whether the unity of the six countries will hold. 
 Part of the reason American and European negotiators have chosen this moment to issue ultimatums is that the Group of 8 summit meeting is being held this weekend in St. Petersburg, Russia. This is the first time Russia serves as host, and Moscow seems to want to avoid having the talks dominated by the failure of major powers to agree on how to deal with Iran. Once the summit meeting is over, the leverage will be gone. 
 Indeed, sanctions are still way off. A senior American official said diplomats planned to meet at the United Nations next week to draft a resolution ordering Iran to suspend its enrichment activities, including turning off the fast-spinning centrifuges that enrich uranium. 
 If Iran does not comply, the group would then seek harsher action. But the statement on Wednesday gave no timetable. The senior American official said Iran would be given ''a number of days'' to comply. 
 At the United Nations, John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said, ''Obviously, we will be consulting here beginning this afternoon to carry out the direction that the foreign ministers have given us.'' 
 The group of six nations said it could stop the Security Council action at any time, provided Iran suspended its uranium enrichment. The United States has set the suspension as a condition for holding direct high-level talks with Iran; diplomatic ties were severed when revolutionaries seized the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979. 
 Before the group issued its statement, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said Wednesday: ''We are willing to negotiate about our nuclear program based on fair principles. If the circumstances are unjust, our people will not back down.''
 The six countries agreed on a list of possible sanctions but have not yet decided which ones might be imposed. The list includes travel restrictions on Iranian officials, a ban on cultural exchanges and visas for Iranians, financial restrictions, political sanctions and even an oil embargo, although the latter is seen as highly unlikely and one that could further rattle global markets.
 The incentives presented to Iran include access to light-water nuclear reactors, support for Tehran's entry into the World Trade Organization, lifting a ban on selling aircraft and parts to Iran and other economic measures. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad has said that, ''God willing,'' Iran would respond to the offer by late August. But in a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, refused to be pinned down to any deadline. 
 Wednesday's meeting of foreign ministers brought with it some bickering between Secretary Rice and her Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, diplomats said. There was quick agreement on the text of the statement by deputy ministers, but Mr. Lavrov and Ms. Rice, much as they did two weeks ago in Moscow, criticized each other over other points, including the tactics and timing of the action in the Security Council. 
 ''We had to take into account Russian concerns that we not take steps that would lead Iran to overshadow the G-8,'' one European official said. 
 Russian officials were also concerned that the resolution not eventually lead to military action against Iran.

HEADLINE: Democracy's Long Haul

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1848 a democratic revolution swept across Europe, and then promptly collapsed. Thousands of protesters were killed in the streets. Authoritarian regimes were re-established. Some called 1848 ''the turning point when Europe failed to turn.''
 And yet that wasn't true. Anti-democratic regimes did regain power, but within decades they had enacted most of the reforms the revolutionaries of 1848 had asked for. Constitutions were written. Suffrage was expanded. Welfare systems were created. 
 Conservative authoritarians enacted these reforms reluctantly, and with cynical motivations. But they knew they had to keep up with the times to retain their grip on power and to forestall more radical change. Democracy didn't move forward in a burst of glory, but in a long slog of gradual concessions made by reluctant conservative reformers.
 I wonder if, when we look back at the world of today from some future vantage point, we will see an echo of that pattern.
 We'll see a burst of democratic change that swept the world between 1980 and 2005. Authoritarian regimes collapsed, sometimes under their own weight (the Soviet Union), sometimes amid outside pressure (the Philippines) and sometimes by force (Iraq). In places where the fabric of society was thick, nations maintained their equilibrium and democratic dreams were realized. But in nations where totalitarianism had been strongest, and civil society most brutally pulverized, liberation begat chaos.
 In these places, the old political order was the only source of social authority, and once that was removed everything was permissible. The worst people in the nation were given free rein to prey upon the best. In Iraq, that meant brutal violence, rampant crime and a sectarian power struggle that produced unimaginable horror.
 In Russia, the chaos produced a culture of plunder and gangsterism that rewarded the dishonest. A large share of the population was set free to drink themselves to death, with the average lifespan of the Russian man declining by seven years.
 Moreover, the Western liberators were complicit in and discredited by the chaos. In Russia, the West sent in economists and technocrats. Coming from places that had always been stable, they took for granted the moral foundations that undergird stability. They didn't see that Russia lacked these foundations, and that any institutions they built on top would simply be perverted.
 In Iraq, the American liberators didn't understand what would happen if brutalized Iraqis were left in a state of nature, and didn't or couldn't impose a humane order. 
 So if the first stage of the democratic era in these places was liberation and the second stage was chaos, the third stage was conservative restoration. Unlike the Western democrats, the conservatives -- Putin in Russia, the theocrats and strongmen who came to dominate Iraq -- did understand the desire for order. They understood the people's desire to live in an environment in which it was possible to lead a dignified life. They shared the feeling of national shame that had come amid the chaos and the longing to restore national prestige. In short, they had a deeper understanding of human nature than the technocrats who came to modernize them. 
 The autocrats created nations that were not totalitarian but not free. On the one hand they sought to stifle liberty in order to secure their grip on power. Democracy activists were arrested and TV stations suborned. On the other hand, as in 1848, the democratic forces did not go away. The people, especially the growing middle classes, longed for freedom. New technologies threatened centralized power. The conservative autocrats would find that if they did not buy off the public with gradual reforms, they would either have to rule by terror, which is unstable, or more radical reforms would be imposed upon them.
 If this pattern is true, and future historians do look back on our period this way, then a crucial task for U.S. foreign policy in the years ahead will be to cajole semi-autocratic regimes -- in places ranging from Russia to the Middle East and even China -- into making gradual democratic reforms. At the moment we do this badly, alternating between bold speeches that call for revolution and craven diplomatic gestures that suggest capitulation.
 We're out of the period of mass rallies and toppling regimes and orange revolutions. We're coming into a period of, at best, a gradualist conservative reform. It's time to come up with a strategy for helping today's unimaginative autocrats to become new and improved Bismarcks.

HEADLINE: Democrats Link Fortunes To Rise in Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12 

 BODY:
Democrats, seeking to energize voters over economic issues in much the way that Republicans have rallied conservatives with efforts to ban same-sex marriage, have begun a broad campaign to raise the minimum wage and focus attention on income inequality.
 The Democratic argument is straightforward: it has been more than eight years since Congress last raised the minimum wage, to $5.15 an hour, and inflation has reduced its real value to the lowest level in more than 20 years. At the same time, Democrats say, executive pay has risen to ever-higher levels and Congress has regularly approved pay raises for itself. 
 With midterm elections less than four months away, Democrats have begun state ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage in more than a half-dozen states where Republicans are in danger of losing House or Senate seats.
 The issue is playing a role in Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Arizona -- all states where Republican senators are fighting for survival.
 Pressure is so high in Ohio that Senator Mike DeWine broke ranks with fellow Republicans last month and voted for a Democratic bill that would have raised the minimum wage to $7.15 an hour. The measure received 52 votes, a majority, but not the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster.
 Democratic leaders in Congress are closely coordinating their efforts in Washington with campaigns in critical races around the country. Democratic lawmakers say they will try to block what is normally an automatic pay increase for members of Congress until Republicans agree to raise the federal minimum wage. 
 ''We are putting some skin in the game,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''We're saying that there will be no pay increases for Congress until there's an increase in the minimum wage. This separates us from Republicans.'' 
 Last weekend, Mr. Emanuel held news conferences in five cities across upstate New York, with Democratic lawmakers and candidates signing pledges to oppose any increase in Congressional pay until the minimum wage is raised. 
 Republican lawmakers have repeatedly defeated increases in the minimum wage over the past eight years. Business groups, supported by many economists, have always fought such increases on the argument that setting wages above normal market levels will cause employers to cut back on hiring the very low-wage workers an increase would be intended to benefit.
 ''The minimum wage raises the take-home pay for some people at the expense of others,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. 
 ''It is wrong to redistribute money from the worse-off workers to other low-income workers.''
 For the most part, Republicans have sought to avoid debates about the minimum wage and focus on the overall strength of the economy. They note that unemployment is down to 4.6 percent, that the nation has added about 5.4 million jobs in the last three years and that wages have been climbing this year. Though most economists are dubious about the benefits of a minimum wage, the evidence of a link between a higher minimum wage and higher unemployment is mixed. 
 The unemployment rate among teenagers, a big share of minimum-wage workers, has remained above 13 percent ever since 2000 even though the minimum wage has gone down in real terms, after adjusting for inflation. Unemployment among people 16 to 19 has hovered around 15 percent this year.
 Opponents of higher minimum wages contend that prosperity is best generated by stronger economic growth rather than by mandated wage levels. And while the minimum wage has lost about 20 percent of its buying power since the last increase, average hourly wages have done better. 
 According to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center economic research group in Washington, ''real'' average hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, have edged up to $16.52 in May of this year from $15.58 in 1997. 
 In general, hourly wages have climbed much more slowly than productivity. Largely as a result, corporate profits have increased rapidly over the past several years and account for an unusually big share of the nation's total gross domestic product.
 Senate Democrats, at a news conference here on Wednesday, said the minimum wage was long overdue for an increase and had lagged far behind prices for gasoline, health care and college tuition.
 ''We cannot sit by while minimum-wage workers see the real value of their wages decline,'' said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. ''We need to do right by hard-working Americans and raise the minimum wage.''
 Mrs. Clinton, a potential presidential candidate in 2008, traveled through Ohio on Sunday and Monday and talked up the issue as she campaigned for Representative Sherrod Brown, who is trying to unseat Senator DeWine this fall. On Monday, she spoke specifically about the minimum wage before a crowd of community activists.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said: ''The average American thinks that the minimum wage ought to be raised, even if they are making more than the minimum wage. Far more importantly from a political viewpoint, it appeals to certain groups of people who don't usually turn out to vote.''
 Democratic strategists systematically looked for issues on which they could start statewide ballot initiatives that would increase voter turn-out among groups that were likely to vote Democratic. ''Minimum wage was at the top of the list,'' Mr. Schumer said.

HEADLINE: New York's Comeback

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The New York Paradox'' (column, July 10):
Paul Krugman is right that New York City's rebirth as a magnet for corporate headquarters has turned the conventional wisdom about the 21st-century marketplace on its head. But there is more to the story. 
 Both corporations and people left the city in the 1970's as the streets grew dirtier and more dangerous, the school system failed, parks deteriorated and the housing decayed.
 Today, people and corporations are moving to the city in large numbers, not merely because of private-sector forces, but also because of smart public-sector strategies.
 Under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the city has become safer and cleaner, the school system is being turned around and more than 300 acres of parkland have been added. 
 These initiatives, together with long-term economic investments and responsible fiscal budgeting, explain why the city's housing starts, tourism numbers and credit rating have all hit record highs. And it's why executives and entrepreneurs -- and people of all income levels -- recognize that New York City is a highly attractive place to live, work and raise their families.

Daniel L. Doctoroff
Deputy Mayor for Economic
Development and Rebuilding
New York, July 10, 2006

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman states that New York City has become ''an urban economy that offers a mix of very highly paid financial jobs and low-wage service jobs, with relatively little in the middle.'' And he concludes that the city seems to be doing O.K.
 I am confused. A city of the extreme rich and extreme poor, with the middle class eradicated, and that is O.K.? What would he consider to be a disaster?

HEADLINE: National Briefing Washington: Commerce Secretary Urges Guest Worker Program 

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS (NYT)

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez urged Congress to pass legislation that would put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship and create a temporary worker program to ensure that American companies could meet their labor needs. Mr. Gutierrez, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that 500 of the nation's top economists recently sent a letter to the Bush administration stating that immigration had been a net gain for Americans. Meanwhile, House Republicans announced plans for seven more hearings this month to highlight their concerns about the Senate immigration bill, which would legalize most of the nation's illegal immigrants.

HEADLINE: Regulators Penalize Microsoft In Europe

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER and STEVE LOHR; Paul Meller reported from Brussels for this article, and Steve Lohr from New York.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, July 12 

 BODY:
The European Commission fined Microsoft $357 million on Wednesday for failing to comply with an antitrust order, even as the company faces more battles with European regulators over its next big product.
 The fine was meant to punish the company for not sharing technical information about its hugely profitable Windows operating system with competitors, as it was ordered to in a European antitrust ruling in 2004. It was the first time a company had been fined for not obeying a European antitrust order.
Neelie Kroes, Europe's competition commissioner, said the fine was justified because Microsoft had for two years failed to supply information in a way that would allow rival software makers to make their programs work smoothly with Windows. ''No company is above the law,'' Ms. Kroes said in a news conference in Brussels.
 In letters to the company this year, the European authorities have also raised concerns and asked questions about Windows Vista, the next version of the operating system, focusing on Microsoft's plans to build in new Internet search features, security software and document formats. 
 The most recent letter from the commission came on July 4, requesting answers to an additional 79 questions, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview on Wednesday.
 Microsoft now anticipates regulatory reviews as just another step in its development of Windows, the dominant PC operating system. In the United States, Mr. Smith noted, Microsoft has heard repeatedly from the independent technical committee set up to monitor the company, as part of the settlement of the long-running federal antitrust suit against Microsoft.
 Mr. Smith said the company had made design changes in response to the expert advice, like changing settings to make it easier for consumers and PC manufacturers to substitute competitors' software for Microsoft features in Vista. 
 The American regulatory review, Mr. Smith said, is nearly over. ''In Europe, we don't have guidance that is anywhere near as concrete as in the United States,'' Mr. Smith said. ''My worry is that we won't have clarity from the European regulators until it is too late, until just before Vista is scheduled to ship and we won't be able to make changes.
 ''And then we'll be right back to debating the past, as we are now, instead of addressing these issues before the product is shipped.''
 Microsoft has said it plans to make Vista available to business customers in November and to consumers in January.
 The information-sharing order in the European antitrust ruling was meant to ensure fair competition in the market for data-serving software that powers Internet applications and corporate data centers, where Microsoft's server software competes with offerings from I.B.M., Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Red Hat and other companies. 
 Microsoft has repeatedly said it made good-faith efforts to comply with the order, which was a brief, general admonition, included in a 300-page ruling, to supply ''complete and accurate technical specifications.'' The company said it has had several hundred people working full time to produce thousands of pages of technical documentation.
 But in March, the commission's independent monitor called Microsoft's work ''incomplete, inaccurate and unusable.'' Since then, Microsoft has worked more closely with the commission and the outside consultant, Neil Barrett, and received more detailed instruction on what was required. 
 ''They are making constructive efforts now,'' Ms. Kroes said. ''It's a shame they didn't do so two years ago.'' 
 Microsoft said it planned to hand over the last of the requested documents and specifications on July 18. If the commission decides Microsoft has obeyed the order, there will be no further fines. If not, it could double the current daily fine of 1.5 million euros ($1.91 million). The fine announced on Wednesday was the daily total from Dec. 16 last year to June 30.
 Microsoft is appealing the fine. It is also appealing the 2004 antitrust ruling in Europe, and the much larger fine of more than $600 million that was part of that ruling.
 Microsoft's rivals in the market for server software have said the company has played a stalling game by design, gaining market share all the while by unfairly leveraging its dominance of PC desktops. They have noted that for a company sitting on $35 billion in cash, the fines are little more than a nuisance.
 ''The lack of technical disclosure perpetuates a Microsoft lock-in that steers people who use Windows on the desktop to Microsoft server software,'' said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association, a group that supported the European action. ''And the European Commission is determined to break that anticompetitive lock-in.''
 Microsoft's share of the market for commercial packages of server software has increased by nearly 10 percentage points in the last two years, to 71 percent in 2005, according to IDC, a market research firm. Rivals have said that Microsoft's anticompetitive practices have contributed to the gains, while Microsoft has countered that it offers superior products.
 Microsoft shares fell 2 percent on Wednesday, slipping 46 cents, to $22.64. 
 Because the company is so wealthy, analysts said, the financial impact of the fine is slight. But Charles di Bona, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, noted that the fine ''looks like a pretty hostile act, especially if you think that Microsoft is complying now, as the comments of the European competition commissioner suggest.'' He added: ''You have to expect that Europe will be aggressive on Vista.''
 The issues surrounding Vista concern the part of the 2004 European ruling that seeks to curb Microsoft's ability to bundle new software products into the Windows operating system. The European Commission took a much stronger stand on bundling than authorities in the United States, where the 2001 settlement left Microsoft free to design Windows as it wished.
 One design choice being reviewed by the commission is Microsoft's decision to include a new document format in Vista that will compete with Adobe's widely used portable document format, or P.D.F. In a letter to Ms. Kroes on April 11, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, proposed four possible solutions to the European concern that Vista would harm competition for document formats and document-reading software.
 The options included adding P.D.F.-reading software in Vista, letting PC makers hide Microsoft's document format and related software, letting PC makers in Europe remove the document software and offering a higher-priced version of Vista in Europe that includes the software.
 Microsoft is uneasy about what it sees as the growing interest of European governments, in particular, to delve into the design of technology products. ''If regulators are going to dive deeply into the design of costly, research-based products, we need a constructive dialogue early in the process,'' Mr. Smith said. ''What we really need is guidance in advance, not criticism after the fact.'' 
 Mr. Smith gave no hint that the European review would further delay Vista, whose shipment schedule has slipped repeatedly.

HEADLINE: Group of 8 Talks, Like So Much These Days, Are All About Energy: Russia's Gas and Oil 

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Andrew E. Kramer also reported from Irkutsk, Russia, for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 12 

 BODY:
Deep beneath the thick forests of Siberia, near Lake Baikal, lies a vast deposit of natural gas known as Kovykta, a field so large it could supply all the United States' needs for three years. 
 But Russia has so far refused to allow the private companies developing the field to build a pipeline to export the gas. Instead, the only customer is a tiny neighboring logging town happy to replace its soot-belching, coal-fired power with gas.
 Kovykta is a small thrust in President Vladimir V. Putin's single-minded drive to put the reins of the country's vast natural resources in the Kremlin's hands. It is part of his strategy to enrich the state and recover Russia's claim to superpower status, lost in the Soviet collapse. 
 As leaders of the Group of 8 nations gather in St. Petersburg on Saturday, Mr. Putin and his deputies are talking with a newfound confidence and swagger that plays well at home and leaves many Western officials frustrated. 
 Asked in an American television interview on Wednesday about recent criticisms by Vice President Dick Cheney that Russia was backsliding on democracy and using its energy resources as ''tools of intimidation or blackmail,'' Mr. Putin responded with a cutting and personal taunt.
 ''I think that these kinds of comments from your vice president amount to the same thing as an unfortunate shot while out hunting,'' Mr. Putin said in an interview with NBC, according to the Kremlin's translation. The reference reflected the sometimes crude jokes made after Mr. Cheney accidentally wounded a hunting companion in February. 
 The Kremlin's energy polices have caused growing concern and criticism. Despite calls from European and American leaders for the Kremlin to open up Russia's market, allowing greater foreign investment and unfettered access to its network of oil and gas pipelines, Mr. Putin has made it clear that he will not bend on the energy issue, which he has put at the top of the St. Petersburg agenda. 
 Mr. Putin has brushed aside European entreaties about its energy policies, dismissing as unfounded the concerns raised seven months ago when, in a dispute with Ukraine over natural gas prices, Russia briefly shut down supplies to Europe.
 Far from finding common ground with its European energy customers, Russia has taken several steps to tighten government control, maneuvering to bestow virtually monopoly powers on the two largest state companies in the sector, Gazprom and Rosneft. 
 Russia is not content just to flex its newly developed economic muscle. 
 At a rare news conference last month, Vladislav Y. Surkov, Mr. Putin's deputy chief of staff and the Kremlin's behind-the-scenes ideologist, said Russia would no longer submit itself to the demands of Western democracies. 
 ''We are a free nation and we wish to remain a free nation among other free nations, not controlled from the outside,'' Mr. Surkov said.
 Such remarks reflect a new Russian confidence -- even assertiveness -- after 15 years of tumult following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is buoyed by energy prices, certainly, but also by a desire to define a new role for Russia as an independent power, separate and equal to its larger and still wealthier partners.
 Mr. Putin, in pre-summit television interviews on Wednesday, suggested that criticism of Russia's energy policies, of its foreign affairs and of its version of democracy sprang from outdated cold-war competition and even misguided colonial-era arrogance. 
 ''If we go back 100 years and look through the newspapers, we see what arguments the colonial powers of that time advanced to justify their expansion into Africa and Asia,'' he told a French channel, TF1. ''They cited arguments such as playing a civilizing role, the particular role of the white man, the need to civilize 'primitive peoples.'
 ''If we replace the term 'civilizing role' with 'democratization,' then we can transpose practically word for word what the newspapers were writing 100 years ago to today's world and the arguments we hear from some of our colleagues on issues such as democratization and the need to ensure democratic freedoms.''
 With their pleas for more liberal policies rebuffed, President Bush and the other leaders have few options but to accept Russia's new energy status, hoping to strike bargains as junior partners in developments ultimately controlled by the Kremlin. 
 That is what Germany did with a new pipeline under the Baltic Sea, and as the United States and France, along with Norway, hope to do as their companies bid to join a Gazprom project to tap Shtokman, another vast gas field, above the Arctic Circle.
 ''For the two decades prior to 2005, Russia had been continually retreating in the realm of international politics,'' Dmitri Trenin, deputy director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. Describing a resurgent foreign policy ''helped along mightily by high oil and gas prices,'' he said, ''In the past year, Russia has begun acting like the great power it was in czarist times.''
 The United States and Europe can protest, he added, but ''it will not make any difference.''
 The story of how this new Russian confidence has ensnared the gas field in Kovykta -- and with it a prominent company of a Group of 8 partner -- illustrates how the Kremlin is consolidating its monopoly power over gas supplies and why the West is so desperate to find alternatives. 
 Only three years ago the British energy giant BP merged its Russian holdings with a private company to form TNK-BP, in what was seen as a new model of foreign cooperation for the industry, with Kovykta as one of its jewels.
 For BP's executives, the proximity to China, the fastest growing market for natural gas, made it particularly valuable -- certainly worth the hundreds of millions of dollars they invested. Kovykta's gas could open new markets while providing the diversification of routes that American and European officials have called for. 
 ''If you are the Russian government, why wouldn't you want to do this?'' Alastair Ferguson, the director of TNK-BP's gas operations, said in an interview at the company's Moscow headquarters, referring to the potential bonanza of selling Siberian natural gas to a nearly insatiable Chinese market.
 The answer is Gazprom's insistence on controlling exports. Gazprom, a source of wealth for the Kremlin, has wielded its political connections and domination of pipelines not only to become one of the world's largest companies, but also to thwart the plans of its private competitors. In Kovykta's case, the company has blocked efforts by TNK-BP to build its own export pipeline, leaving it sitting on potentially enormous riches with virtually no market.
 Required by its license to pump gas by the end of this year or risk losing the project, TNK-BP is preparing to send gas to Zhigalovo, a logging town with only 5,000 residents, for roughly $30 per thousand cubic meters. Last year Gazprom exported natural gas at an average of $190.
 But Gazprom decides when a pipeline to China is needed, and officials there are saying they do not know when that will be. ''Kovykta could not be developed without export sales, but when these volumes will be needed, it is a very big question,'' Aleksandr I. Medvedev, Gazprom's deputy chief executive officer and director of its export department, said in an interview at the company's sleek headquarters in Moscow. 
 He stressed that Gazprom and the government, not TNK-BP, would answer that question. Gazprom has already signed a broad agreement, in March, with the China National Petroleum Corporation for sales of gas from Siberia, without specifying the source, though TNK-BP executives believe that the state giant has its eyes on Kovykta's supplies.
 That could force TNK-BP to sell out, as another private gas producer, the Itera Group, did recently with a field that also faced limits on access to Gazprom's export pipelines.
 Gazprom has defended its strategies, saying that allowing private producers to ship gas independently would drive down the prices that are now filling Russia's coffers. Indeed, so large are the field's reserves that supplies pouring into the market in Asia could damp prices for liquefied natural gas as far away as California, according to Mr. Ferguson, at TNK-BP.
 Mr. Medvedev dismissed such concerns, including those expressed last week by the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Claude Mandil, who called Gazprom's refusal to expand access to its pipelines absurd.
 Mr. Medvedev also said it should not be a topic this weekend in St. Petersburg. ''It's a technical question,'' he said of concerns about liberalizing Russia's energy market.
 ''Why should it be a topic of the G-8? The G-8 should take care of more serious questions.''

HEADLINE: Central Bank Raises Rates In Japan 

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday July 14 

 BODY:
Japan's central bank raised interest rates on Friday for the first time in six years, a widely watched move that economists called an important test of the embattled bank's ability to manage the rebounding Japanese economy.
 After the end of a two-day meeting, the Bank of Japan said in a statement that it had edged up its target for a benchmark overnight lending rate to 0.25 percent from zero, the clearest signal yet that the country's economy has pulled out of a decade-long slump and that its recovery was proving sustainable. 
The decision was unanimous. The Federal Reserve in Washington has increased its benchmark 17 times since 2004.
 Economists generally praised Friday's move, calling it a small move that would not significantly impact Japan's growth rates but that would send a visible signal to financial markets that the bank was keeping close watch on the Japanese economy. 
 ''In real terms, this is very incremental,'' said Jason Rogers, an Asian banking analyst in the Singapore office of Barclays. ''But it is important symbolically because it means that Japan's economy is starting to function normally again.''
 The bank originally took short-term rates down to zero in 1999, adopting a super-loose monetary policy that was unprecedented in a major economy in hopes of reviving growth and propping up the nation's then teetering banking system. 
 As Japan's $4.6 trillion economy has returned to health in the last two years, attention has been on when the bank would end this policy and return to a more normal interest-rate regime.
 Analysts began to speculate in the last few weeks that the bank might raise rates after recent economic data showed consumer and wholesale prices were starting to rebound, after years of falling prices, or deflation.
 While the size of the increase was small, economists called it an important show of resolve by the bank and its governor, Toshihiko Fukui, who has come under criticism in recent weeks for an investment scandal. Mr. Fukui has faced pressure to resign after revealing that he invested in a stock fund run by an executive who was later indicted for insider trading.
 The bank has also faced intense pressure from powerful politicians who had opposed a rate increase for fear of destroying jobs and increasing the cost of servicing Japan's huge national debt. 
 Economists said Friday's increase appeared to be an assertion of independence by the central bank, which had been under the control of the powerful finance ministry until the late 1990's. 
 Akio Makabe, a professor specializing in central bank policy at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Japan, said that the bank wanted to show that it was up to the task of stewarding Japan's economy, the world's second-largest after the United States. 
 ''The Bank of Japan wants to show that it can be effective,'' Mr. Makabe said.
 Mr. Makabe said the bank considers the increase a chance to restore its reputation, which has been tarnished by a series of policy blunders. 
 Shares fell sharply Friday morning in Tokyo ahead of the decision; the Nikkei index was down more than 240 points at midday.
 In making Friday's decision, Mr. Fukui and other members of the policy board are walking a fine line. 
 If they raised borrowing costs too soon, they risked snuffing out growth and pushing Japan back into recession. But if they waited too long, they faced the danger of allowing Japan's economy to overheat, sparking inflation or fueling an asset price bubble in Tokyo's resurgent real estate and stock markets.
 What they want to do is avoid past mistakes that had raised questions about its ability to manage Japan. The biggest was its failure to respond quickly to twin real estate and stock market bubbles in the late 1980's, and then to raise rates too quickly when it did act. The result was a hard landing that many economists have cited for keeping Japan in a slump during the 1990's.
 More recently, the bank made an ill-timed rate increase in 2000, when the economy was still weak, and then had to cut rates in an embarrassing reversal a few months later.
 Many politicians have warned that the bank could also be premature in raising rates this time.
 The finance minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, on Friday reiterated his calls for the bank to keep borrowing costs low to spur growth.
 ''We want them to firmly support the recovery through monetary policy,'' he told reporters. Earlier this week, he said, ''there was no need to rush in ending the zero-rate policy.''
 But the bank got votes of support from other politicians, including the economic policy minister, Kaoru Yosano, who said Friday that ''the zero-interest rate policy is an exceptional policy, and lifting it is the right thing to do.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Put Pressure On Shares

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday for a second day as oil prices surged to a new high amid growing turmoil in the Middle East.
 Investors, unnerved by news of an Israeli assault on Lebanon and other worries, pushed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index further down toward the low for the year it had reached last month. The benchmark index has now fallen 2.4 percent over the last two days, erasing its gain for the year.
''Volatility is back,'' said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with Standard & Poor's. ''Political unrest and high oil prices breed uncertainty. And uncertainty breeds volatility. Investors do not like uncertainty.'' 
 So far this year there have already been 21 days when the stock market has risen or fallen at least 1 percent, compared with 30 days for all of 2005.
 Yesterday, crude oil rose $1.75, or 2.3 percent, to $76.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange -- the first time oil prices have passed $76 a barrel, breaking a record set just last week of $75.19.
 ''Another day, another record,'' said Tom Bentz, a senior energy analyst with BNP Paribas in New York. 
 While many energy analysts have floated the idea of $80 a barrel for crude oil for some time, yesterday's rally reinforced expectations that oil prices would continue to climb. 
 ''You see a market that can move $2 in a day, why couldn't we go well above $80 a barrel?'' Mr. Bentz said.
 Even before American markets opened yesterday, the major stock indexes in Europe and Asia had fallen, reacting to news that clashes between Israel and Hezbollah guerrilla fighters in Lebanon had escalated.
 Oil prices spiked in Europe as stocks fell -- a pattern that repeated itself in the United States once trading began.
 In the American stock market, some of the sharpest losses over the last two days have been concentrated among technology stocks. Dell, where revenue from personal computers has dropped considerably, closed yesterday at the lowest level since October 2001. Its shares lost 3 percent, to $21.70.
 Shares of the German software giant SAP lost nearly 7 percent, to close at $46.83, after it reported a loss of market share in the second quarter. In the Nasdaq 100, a closely watched index containing the stocks of many of the largest technology companies, only eight stocks are up over the last two days. 
 Analysts said disappointing second-quarter earnings -- particularly among technology companies -- were adding to investor dismay. 
 ''We have had a few straws in the earnings-season wind which have made people weary,'' said Chris Tinker, European equity strategist at ICAP in London. ''And with TV pictures every five seconds with exploding buildings in the Middle East, instability in Iran and the level of oil prices, everybody is going to be erring on the side of staying away from tech.''
 Since the beginning of May, technology stocks in the S.& P. 500 have lost about 13 percent of their value. 
 Still, the sell-off yesterday went beyond technology. The S.& P. 500 index fell 16.31 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,242.29. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 166.89, or 1.5 percent, to 10,846.29. Only 3 of its 30 components -- Exxon Mobil, Merck and Home Depot -- gained. And the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell to its lowest point since October, sliding 1.7 percent, to 2,054.11.
 In Europe, the major indexes in Britain, France and Germany all lost more than 1.5 percent. The Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 1.8 percent.
 Rapidly rising oil prices -- and the geopolitical instability that is feeding their volatility -- are making investors all the more sensitive to corporate earnings even if the earnings are not all that disappointing. 
 Alcoa, for example, said late Monday that its second-quarter sales grew 62 percent. But earnings per share missed Wall Street's consensus estimate by a penny and Alcoa's stock has fallen about 5 percent.
 In another sign of the increasing wariness among investors, gold prices rose today as they typically do in periods of market volatility when investors are looking for more stable investments. Bond prices also rose.
 ''People are more willing to take risk if they feel there's a clear direction,'' Mr. Tinker said. ''And we need to see confirmation from the earnings season giving us that direction before we see money being committed.''
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year inflation notes: 



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	High Price	99.593	High Yield	2.550	Low Yield	2.000	Median Yield	2.510	Accepted at low price	88%	Total applied for	$17,451,670	Accepted	$10,588,254	Noncompetitive	$97,985	Interest set at	2 1/2%	


The 10-year inflation notes mature July 15, 2016.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Increase

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The number of workers filing first-time applications for state jobless benefits rose last week because of temporary shutdowns at some auto factories and a partial closure of government services in New Jersey.
 Initial jobless claims rose by 19,000, to 332,000, in the week that ended July 8, the Labor Department said yesterday. The four-week average of claims, a less volatile measure, rose to 317,250, from 308,500.
Claims dropped to a five-year low of 281,000 in January as economic growth surged to an annual pace of 5.6 percent in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: An Impala's-Eye View of Highway History

BYLINE: By FINN-OLAF JONES

 BODY:

Cross Country
Fifteen Years and 90,000 Miles on the Roads and Interstates of America With Lewis and Clark, a Lot of Bad Motels, a Moving Van, Emily Post, Jack Kerouac, My Wife, My Mother-in-Law, Two Kids, and Enough Coffee to Kill an Elephant
By Robert Sullivan
Illustrated. 389 pages. Bloomsbury. $24.95.
 For those of us reared on family car vacations, Jack Kerouac and every buddy road story from Lewis and Clark to ''Thelma and Louise,'' crossing the country is such an American ritual it's like pledging allegiance to the flag at 65 miles per hour. Get that average speed up to a mere 110 and, thanks to the miracle of the Interstate, it's possible to race across the continent in one day and still have time to pick up a couple of Happy Meals at the drive-through. 
The Interstate highway system turned 50 this month. Robert Sullivan, chronicler of swamps, whales and rodents (as the author of ''Meadowlands,'' ''A Whale Hunt'' and ''Rats''), now applies his onion-peeling skills to the evolution of this multilane leveler of mountains, deserts, rivers and regionalism.
 Mr. Sullivan, his wife and two children make a six-day odyssey on Interstates from Oregon to New York City in a Chevy Impala, the ''four-door, full-size relative of a drag racer'' and the vehicle of choice for two generations of cops and cabbies. 
 ''Never go on a cross-country trip with me,'' Mr. Sullivan warns early in ''Cross Country,'' with 354 pages still to go, ''for I can't stop rattling on about what I assume or even imagine to be the significance of things.'' The Interstate route allows him to riff on milestones along America's road to becoming a Country of Roads. 
 The obvious start for Mr. Sullivan is Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, where Lewis and Clark washed up after 18 months in the wilderness, eager for dog meat as a relief from eating salmon.
 But how much of a wilderness had it really been? Mr. Sullivan contemplates the preponderance of trappers, settlers, English place names and overseas goods along the route and puts matters into fresh perspective; the expedition wasn't really the first transcontinental voyage, it was merely ''the first round-trip across the North American continent by a white guy associated with the federal government.'' 
 Lewis shot himself in 1809 (though Mr. Sullivan also discusses the possibility that he was murdered), and Clark procrastinated another five years to edit their notes about the route few would ever travel again -- most pioneers crossed the Continental Divide via the gentler slopes to the south. By the time the official expedition report was published, the real future of mass transcontinental travel had been etched through the Alleghenies with the first federally financed highway, leading from Maryland to West Virginia. Commissioned by Congress, it was covered with crushed stone to allow for easy passage by carriage. By 1823, it had extended 800 miles to St. Louis.
 Overland wagon trails, the railroad and then cars led the migration farther west. The first transcontinental road was the brainchild of Carl Fisher, an automobile promoter fond of dropping bicycles and cars off tall buildings as publicity stunts, and eventual founder of the Indianapolis 500. In 1910 Fisher spearheaded a highly tenuous intertwining of farm lanes, city streets and newly constructed ''seedling roads'' -- concrete strips less than a mile long -- into the Lincoln Highway, linking New York City with San Francisco.
 In 1915, seven years before publishing her book on etiquette, Emily Post took a travel assignment from Collier's, packing the family silver and a stiff upper lip for a drive across the country on the Lincoln Highway. Her car finally gave up in New Mexico, and she ended up taking the train the rest of the way. ''It is your troubles on the road,'' Ms. Post wrote, ''that afterwards become your most treasured memories.''
 Another traveler, Dwight D. Eisenhower, spent two months in 1919 driving a military convoy across the country; the shoddy roads left a lasting impression on him. After World War II he studied Hitler's autobahn and concluded that the American military should have one. In 1956 he signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act, which, the president recounted in his memoir, resulted in enough concrete to build ''six sidewalks to the moon.'' The new highways were originally meant to loop around cities that could be skirted should they be destroyed by atomic bombs. Instead, the loops started a suburban construction boom that continues to this day. Mr. Sullivan reports that Phoenix, a city that virtually rose out of the Interstate, currently gobbles up land at the rate of 1.2 acres per hour.
 In the 1960's state toll roads entered into the system, extending the web to all corners of the country. Today almost 47,000 miles of Interstate highways -- with attendant motels, fast-food courts and construction projects -- have paved over the continent with such efficiency that one can move from sea to shining sea with speed, economy and almost zero interpersonal interaction.
 Which is essentially how the Sullivans' drive goes. ''I sense that this is another person who I have gotten to know the tiniest bit by walking down a hall he was in at a very early hour,'' Mr. Sullivan notes, spotting a fellow motel guest at a Kum & Go station.
 Herein is the book's great weakness: very little happens during the journey. Making matters worse, Mr. Sullivan's trademark pointillist writing style, ideal for illustrating exotic activities like whale and rat hunting, becomes pedantic when applied to the more mundane task of highway cruising. 
 Between musings on history, the six-day drive stretches into 372 pages of mind-numbing logistics: a troublesome roof pack is installed, adjusted and readjusted ad nauseam; ''enough coffee to drown an elephant'' is described cup by cup; a quest for the next Holiday Inn Express seems to take longer than Lewis and Clark's crossing of the Bitterroot Mountains. 
 There are moments of brilliance along the way. But the verbose text, like the notes that pioneers deposited along old Western wagon trails, encourages the reader to take shortcuts. Too bad Mr. Sullivan or an editor didn't take them first.

* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Starts previews tonight; opens Thursday. When it originally opened in February, Charles Isherwood wrote: ''Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens'' (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200.

Broadway

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of cliches set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Broadway

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)

'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE HOUSE IN TOWN' A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich, who replaces Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' Jose Rivera, who wrote the screenplay to ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' penned this rickety piece of historical speculation about the final two days of Che Guevara's life (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)

* 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with elan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Hunka)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)

'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)

Off Off Broadway

'CHEKHOV & MARIA' Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching, beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). The Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)

'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, between Second and Third Avenues, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)

* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)

'BEOWULF & GRENDEL' (R, 102 minutes) The director Sturla Gunnarsson boils this classic epic down into a generic action flick, complete with sweeping vistas, clanging fights, a chiseled hero and a witchy woman who keeps her front door unlocked for both the good guy and the bad. Every so often a severed head lazily rolls across the frame, though, alas, not often enough. (Dargis)

'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)

'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)

'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)

'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)

* 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Stephen Holden)

'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)

'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)

* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)

'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)

'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES' (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)

'THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL' (R, 88 minutes) The post-9/11 self-absorption of a handful of New Yorkers. Occasionally well observed, but mostly irritating and contrived. (Scott)

* 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-age white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)

'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)

'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis)

'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)

'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)

'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)

* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carriere's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)

* 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee)

* 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)

'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)

'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiance home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)

'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)

'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)

* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)

'THE ROAD TO GUANTANAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)

'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)

'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)

'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)

'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)

'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)

'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)

* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)

'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)

ANIMATION AROUND THE WORLD (Through July 31) BAMcinematek's festival of animated films begins Monday with a program of shorts by the Dutch director Paul Driessen, who worked on ''Yellow Submarine.''

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

DAVE ALVIN (Tonight) In the Blasters, in X and now on his own, Mr. Alvin has written and sung about outcasts, lovers and criminals, some of the people who share the road with an itinerant musician. He sets his narratives in country and rockabilly tunes that strive for classic American simplicity, though his words detail an uncertain moral landscape. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Jon Pareles)

* AMADOU AND MARIAM (Sunday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album ''Dimanche a Bamako,'' last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock. With Daby Toure and Birdy Nam Nam. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Ben Sisario)

'AMERICAN IDOLS LIVE' (Tonight through Sunday) The 10 finalists from Season 5 of ''American Idol'' logged about a million yeah-yeah's and baby-baby's on television, and here they come on tour with who knows how many more: Taylor Hicks (the winner), Katharine McPhee (the runner-up), Ace Young, Bucky Covington, Chris Daughtry, Elliott Yamin, Kellie Pickler, Lisa Tucker, Mandisa and Paris Bennett. Tonight at 7, Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; tomorrow and Sunday nights at 7, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $36.50 to $70.50. (Sisario)

BON JOVI (Tuesday and Wednesday) Bon Jovi, the band that titled its 1998 album ''New Jersey,'' is back in its home state. Jon Bon Jovi's band conquered the airwaves in the 1980's and 90's by sticking together everything catchy about 70's rock: Bruce Springsteen's earnestness, Led Zeppelin's crunch, Boston's harmonies, and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. A photogenic lead singer doesn't hurt, either. With Nickelback. At 5 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $37.50 to $125. (Pareles)

BRAVE COMBO (Wednesday) Brave Combo, on a lifelong mission to prove the malleability of polka, plays an all-request show at Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center's outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing. At 7:30 p.m., with a dance lesson at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 875-5460; $15. (Sisario)

BRAVO SILVA, RAISING THE FAWN (Wednesday) Drawing on the spiky and melodic sound of the early Police and U2, the New York band Bravo Silva sings deadpan odes to the city of strangers, though not so deadpan as to exclude playing soaring, ecstatic choruses and having some fun with kitschy keyboards. This month the band has a Wednesday-night residency at Pianos. Also on the bill this week is Raising the Fawn, a group connected to the great Toronto indie-prog collective Broken Social Scene. At 6:30 p.m., 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733; $8. (Sisario)

KELLY CLARKSON (Tomorrow) The first ''American Idol'' champion, who won two Grammys and had the third-best-selling album of 2005, Ms. Clarkson is the best proof yet that reality television might not be a bad idea. With Rooney. At 8 p.m., New England Dodge Music Center, Hartford, (860) 548-7370; $25 to $75. (Sisario)

* DIPLO, CSS, BONDE DO ROLE (Wednesday and Thursday) Diplo, born Wesley Pentz -- his stage name is taken from diplodocus, a dinosaur -- is the influential and eclectic D.J. who has worked with the Sri Lankan-British rapper M.I.A., and is also half of Hollertronix, a virtuoso mixtape team from Philadelphia. He has been borrowing from Brazilian baile funk for years, and the first release on his new record label, Mad Descent, is by the Brazilian group Bonde do Role. Diplo is touring with that band and another Brazilian group, CSS, whose come-ons are shouted in robotic, broken English (''Kiss-kiss-kiss will make this earth quake'') over bare but exuberant art-funk. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; Thursday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sisario)

JOHN HIATT, NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tuesday) Mr. Hiatt has rhymed amoeba with Queen of Sheba; his songs get to the heart of human frailty, loyalty and love, even if they take a sidelong route. He performs with a deep-diving baritone, a twang-happy band and enough strange facial expressions to rival Jim Carrey. The North Mississippi Allstars play an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the hill country near where the members grew up, then turn it into jam-band music. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $30. (Pareles)

I LOVE YOU BUT I'VE CHOSEN DARKNESS (Wednesday) All is cold, echoey gloom in the music of this five-piece band from Austin, Tex., which borrows its spacious sound from Joy Division and its faint vocals from the shoe-gazer British bands of the late 1980's like My Bloody Valentine. With the Big Sleep and Asobi Seksu, a Brooklyn group whose new album, ''Citrus'' (Friendly Fire), shows a fine command of the shoe-gazer sound. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario)

* MADONNA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Part 10 (or so), in which our heroine strikes such poses as Jesus on the cross, James Brown in his cape and John Travolta in his white disco suit, all while performing dance-floor hits in new remixes and reconfigurations. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $354.50 tickets remaining. (Sisario)

MISSION OF BURMA (Tonight) In the early 1980's this innovative and widely influential Boston band brought sharp, brainy guitar minimalism to American postpunk, and since reuniting in 2002 after almost 20 years, it still plays with passion and smarts. With Major Stars. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sisario)

MOBB DEEP, RAEKWON (Wednesday) Mobb Deep, a rap duo from Queens long admired by connoisseurs for its grim and vivid rhymes, was recently taken under 50 Cent's wing, with one result that you might expect: its new album, ''Blood Money'' (G Unit/Interscope), had its debut in the Top 10. Also on the bill is Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan, and a long lineup of opening acts including the Boot Camp Clik. At 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $35. (Sisario)

MUNICIPAL WASTE (Tonight) Seemingly everything about the mid-1980's thrash metal of groups like D.R.I. and Anthrax is lovingly and skillfully recreated by this band from Richmond, Va., from the high-octane riffs and stomping mosh-pit rhythms all the way to the cartoonish, apocalyptic album-cover art. With Annihilation Time, Splitting Headache, Clockcleaner and Dustheads. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $9. (Sisario)

NORTEC COLLECTIVE (Tomorrow) A loose confederation of musicians and visual artists, the Nortec Collective is devoted to the cutting, rearranging and pasting of norteno, the vibrant border style of oompah brass and accordion known on this side of the border as Tex-Mex. With Grupo Sonador. At 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)

OZOMATLI (Tonight) Ozomatli makes what might be called political party music. It's a Los Angeles band that is determined to annex every pan-American party groove from funk to samba to Mexican cumbia in its consciousness-raising songs. With Outernational. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)

RBD (Tomorrow) This teen-pop sextet began on a spinoff of a Mexican soap opera and is now aiming for the American market with an English-language album. Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $49.50 to $115. (Sisario)

JOSH ROUSE (Thursday) Mr. Rouse wraps folk-rock melodies around wistful thoughts about regrets, near-misses and forlorn hopes. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Pareles)

* SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) One of the most tastefully programmed indie-rock festivals in the country, The Village Voice's annual afternoon of noise and sea mist takes place on two stages beside the Coney Island boardwalk, surrounded by hot-dog vendors and the screams of roller-coaster riders. The lineup this year includes the neo-disco Scissor Sisters; the exuberantly sarcastic Art Brut; the Stills, a Canadian band with a moody, shimmering take on the sound of New York bands like Interpol and the Strokes; Stars, a witty and eloquent indie-cabaret band from Toronto; She Wants Revenge and Dirty on Purpose, two more groups with gloom fetishes; Tapes 'n Tapes, from Minneapolis, whose dry rhapsodies recall Pavement and the early Pixies; the bluesy and rough-hewn Deadboy and the Elephantmen; and Man Man, the Rogers Sisters, Priestess, Celebration, Serena Maneesh and the Cribs. From noon to 9 p.m., Surf Avenue, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (212) 475-4022; free. (Sisario)

SOUNDS OF THE UNDERGROUND TOUR (Tomorrow) An afternoon of fast, pummeling heavy metal characterized by lots of death-and-gore-obsessed lyrics, with As I Lay Dying, Cannibal Corpse, In Flames, Trivium, Terror, Black Dahlia Murder and Through the Eyes of the Dead. And since the vaudevillian horror-metal band Gwar is on the bill, there will also be a fair complement of monsters with ripped limbs spurting fake, multicolored blood. At noon, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Sisario)

MATTHEW SWEET AND SUSANNA HOFFS (Monday) Mr. Sweet, the power-pop songwriter with a sensitive side (''Girlfriend''), and Ms. Hoffs, the lead singer of the Bangles, indulge their love of jangly 1960's pop, playing songs from ''Under the Covers, Vol. 1'' (Shout Factory), their recent joint album of loving versions of songs by the Beatles, Love, the Zombies, the Mamas and the Papas, and others. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario)

Jazz

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

A.C.T.I.O.N. 4 (Wednesday) It may sound like a coalition of superheroes, or a TV news team, but this quartet is actually a progressive jazz ensemble built around the compositions of the bassist Sean Conly. The group's other members are Michael Attias and Tony Malaby, saxophonists, and Take Toriyama, drummer. At 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)

BRUCE BARTH TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow) As a pianist, Mr. Barth prefers subtlety and fluency to any kind of flash. His trio, with the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Montez Coleman, performs original compositions alongside less-than-obvious covers, including material by the Grateful Dead. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)

LOU DONALDSON QUARTET (Through Sunday) Bebop, blues and boogaloo are all fair game for Mr. Donaldson, a veteran alto saxophonist who receives strong support here from Kyle Koehler on Hammond B-3 organ, Randy Johnston on guitar and Fukushi Tainaka on drums. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30. (Chinen)

MAYNARD FERGUSON & HIS BIG BOP NOUVEAU BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) His signature high notes have inevitably lost some luster, but Mr. Ferguson is still a bravura trumpeter and charismatic front man, and this 11-piece ensemble, under the musical direction of the drummer Stockton Helbing, suits both sets of skills. (Through July 23.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

4INOBJECTS (Sunday) An experimental but tuneful collective composed of Yoon Sun Choi on vocals, Jacob Sacks on keyboards, Jacob Garchik on trombone, Dave Ambrosio on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $5. (Chinen)

CLARK GAYTON QUINTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Gayton, a sharp trombonist, has worked in a colorful array of horn sections, including his current gig with Bruce Springsteen's Seeger Sessions Band. As a leader, he brings a jazz flexibility to dub and reggae, gospel and soul. At 9 p.m., 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Zinc Bar, 90 West Houston Street at LaGuardia Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 477-8337; cover, $5, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

GOOD FOR COWS (Tonight and tomorrow) The bassist Devin Hoff and the drummer Ches Smith comprise this Bay Area duo, which interrogates jazz and punk with equal rigor. On the second night, they're joined by the guitarist Mary Halvorson and the violist Jessica Pavone, two musicians with a duo rapport of their own. At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

* JAZZ IN JULY (Tuesday through Thursday) A year ago, the pianist Bill Charlap presided over his first season as artistic director of this venerable traditional jazz series, successfully clearing the bar set by his predecessor, Dick Hyman. The new season begins next week, with guest-laden tributes to Duke Ellington (Tuesday), Mr. Hyman (Wednesday) and Thelonious Monk (Thursday). Wynton Marsalis, making an appearance on the Monk evening, provides the most potent dose of jazz celebrity; but among this festival's regular patronage, Mr. Hyman himself looms just as large. Tickets will go quickly, if they haven't already. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500 or www.92y.org, $50. (Chinen)

LATIN IN MANHATTAN FESTIVAL (Through Thursday) Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola's second annual Latin jazz festival started this week with Claudia Acuna, a vocalist guided by the pulse and passion of her native Chile, who plays through Sunday with a strong quintet. Tuesday marks the start of a six-night engagement with Grady Tate and Latin Flavor, a heavily rhythmic sextet led by Mr. Tate on vocals. (Through July 30.)

CHUCK MANGIONE (Through Sunday) Mr. Mangione's fluegelhorn has been a staple of instrumental pop for more than 30 years, and his trademark hit, ''Feels So Good,'' helped pave the way for smooth jazz. He leads a polished group that includes the saxophonist and flutist Gerard Niewood and the guitarist Coleman Mellett. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

KATE McGARRY (Tomorrow) Ms. McGarry is a quiet but potent singer who recasts jazz and folk material alike with a quavering sincerity. She performs here with the guitarist Keith Ganz, the keyboardist Gary Versace and the drummer Dan Rieser. At 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. (Chinen)

BEN MONDER GROUP (Sunday) ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), the most recent album by the guitarist Ben Monder, is a small-scale but ambitious suite of original music that doesn't sound quite like anything else. Mr. Monder presents much of the same material here, with the bassist Chris Lightcap and the drummer Ted Poor. At 8 and 10 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen)

MARK MURPHY (Tomorrow) Mr. Murphy is a singer known mainly for sly insouciance, but on his recent album ''Once to Every Heart'' (Verve), he opted for a burnished and broken romanticism. He performs here in the most intimate of settings, accompanied only by the guitarist Jack Wilkins. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

SANGHA QUARTET (Monday) This ensemble, led by the keyboardist Kevin Hays, creates an electronic jazz hybrid with a sensibility that hovers somewhere between pop and experimental fusion.

At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)

TODD SICKAFOOSE GROUP (Wednesday) Mr. Sickafoose is a bassist-composer equally fond of rough edges and rounded forms, as he demonstrated on an evocative recent album, ''Blood Orange'' (Secret Hatch). He performs here with the trumpeter Russ Johnson and the trombonist Alan Ferber; the guitarists Adam Levy and Mike Gamble; and the percussionists Mike Dillon and Ches Smith. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)

DR. LONNIE SMITH TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Under Dr. Smith's command, the Hammond B-3 organ can be subtly atmospheric or growlingly ecstatic; together with the guitarist Peter Bernstein and the drummer Alison Miller, he delivers a searching brand of soul jazz. Continues through July 23. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)

Continues through July 23. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

BEN WALTZER TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Waltzer, a pianist, manages a thoughtful modernism that coexists more than peaceably with a buoyant, un-self-conscious sense of swing. His trio, with Matt Penman and Gerald Cleaver on bass and drums, is first-rate. At 8 and 9:45 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; no cover, $10 minimum. (Chinen)

DAVID WEISS AND THE POINT OF DEPARTURE QUINTET (Thursday) An assertive trumpeter and accomplished arranger, Mr. Weiss leads an ensemble well stocked with young talent: J. D.

At 10 p.m., Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-6056; cover, $20. (Chinen)

* JOE WILDER QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The trumpeter Joe Wilder, still playing well in his mid-80's, has had a wealth of professional experience both in and out of jazz.

He returns to the club next week with the same supporting cast of Michael Weiss on piano, John Webber on bass and Lewis Nash on drums. Continues through July 23. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

 Opera

GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tomorrow and Sunday) This company's productions almost invariably end up at the New York City Opera, and lots of people drive up to Cooperstown, N.Y., to get an early glimpse of what's on the way. But Glimmerglass, with its intimate, comfortable and up-to-date house, is a vastly superior place to see and hear these productions than the cavernous New York State Theater. The company opened its season with a light work, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag. This week's schedule also includes Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' in a production by Leon Major. ''Pirates'': tomorrow night at 8; ''Barbiere'': Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255; $64 to $112. (Allan Kozinn)

'GRENDEL' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The wall works! The Lincoln Center Festival is breathing easy. As everyone seems to know by now, the Los Angeles Opera's premiere of ''Grendel,'' the operatic adaptation of John Gardner's 1971 novel, a retelling of the epic poem ''Beowulf,'' composed by Elliot Goldenthal and directed by Julie Taymor, had to be postponed when the 16-ton rotating wall that dominated the set would not rotate. Now installed at the New York State Theater, the wall is operating smoothly and the elaborate production, complete with Ms. Taymor's trademark puppets, tree-man creatures and flying dancers, seems glitch-free. Alas, Mr. Goldenthal's derivative music is like an ominous and obvious film score and the opera is weighted down with philosophical mumbo-jumbo. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 721-6500; $40 to $200. (Anthony Tommasini)

New Jersey Opera Theater (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the pre-eminent opera company for the state. Besides presenting performances, the company offers master classes and educational outreach programs. The productions include Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' directed by David Grabarkewitz and conducted by Brent McMunn, and an intriguing double bill of Puccini's comedy ''Gianni Schicchi'' and ''Buoso's Ghost,'' a one-act work from 1996 by Michael Ching, which picks up the story of the clever Schicchi where Puccini's opera leaves off. Steven Condy sings Schicchi in both works; James Caraher conducts. ''L'Elisir d'Amore'': tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m. and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; ''Schicchi'' and ''Buoso'': tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 to $49. (Tommasini)

The Sequenza Trio, with the violinist Mark Kaplan, the cellist Adrian Brendel and the pianist Yael Weiss, takes over tomorrow and Sunday to play works by Martinu, Schubert (the great E-flat Trio, Op. 100) and Paul Chihara's ''Ain't No Sunshine.'' On Thursday, the Gala String Quartet and Olga Vinokur, the pianist, join forces for Mozart's chamber version of his Piano Concerto No. 12 (K. 414) and the Schumann Piano Quintet (Op. 44). Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35 tonight, tomorrow and Sunday; $40 on Thursday. (Kozinn)

CARAMOOR (Tonight through Sunday, Thursday) The chamber ensemble Opus One frames its program of piano quartets tonight in favorites, with Mozart's Quartet in E flat (K. 493) to begin and Dvorak's Quartet in E flat (Op. 87) to close. Between them it offers a more recent adventure, George Tsontakis's Piano Quartet No. 3. Tomorrow night Michael Barrett conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's in the premiere of a Piano Concerto by John Musto, Caramoor's stylistically omnivorous composer in residence. Also on the program are Beethoven's ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3 and Schumann's ''Spring'' Symphony.

On Thursday, the brilliant American pianist Christopher Taylor will perform Messiaen's complete ''Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus,'' a two-hour workout that includes some of the most difficult and complex yet sublime and ecstatic music ever written for piano. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 4:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252; $27 and $37 tonight, $17.50 to $67.50 tomorrow, $19 to $49 on Sunday, $17 and $27 on Thursday. (Kozinn)

* INTERNATIONAL KEYBOARD INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL (Sunday through Thursday) This expansive festival of master classes and concerts runs through the rest of July, and tends to draw the biggest crowds of all the Mannes College of Music's summer series.

On Monday Fabio Bidini plays Schumann's ''Carnaval'' and Beethoven's ''Waldstein'' and ''Appassionata'' Sonatas.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC'S CONCERTS IN THE PARKS (Tonight, tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday) The Philharmonic has left the air-conditioned confines of Avery Fisher Hall for its annual series of free concerts in the parks. Notably, the conductors and soloists for both programs this summer are dynamic women. The orchestra's impressive associate conductor, Xian Zhang, offers two Tchaikovsky works, the ''Coronation March'' and the Violin Concerto (with the charismatic violinist Jennifer Koh as soloist), and Dvorak's exuberant Symphony No. 8. The series ends on Tuesday with the adventurous Marin Alsop conducting John Adams's ''Chairman Dances,'' Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1, with the virtuosic Leila Josefowicz as soloist, and Beethoven's always-popular Fifth Symphony. Expect these concerts, as usual, to draws tens of thousands of people for picnics in the parks and music under the stars (if nature cooperates). There will be fireworks after each performance. Tonight at 8, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island; tomorrow at 8 p.m., Heckscher State Park, East Islip, N.Y.; Monday at 8 p.m., Van Cortlandt Park, Broadway and West 246th Street, the Bronx; Tuesday at 8 p.m., Great Lawn, Central Park; (212) 875-5709.

Chunky Move (Tonight and tomorrow) Australian men apparently have dancing difficulties too; perhaps not these particular men, though. Using video montages and interviews, the members of the physical Australian troupe Chunky Move channel their inner wallflowers in ''I Want to Dance Better at Parties.''

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

Bruce Museum: 'Best in Show: Dogs in Art From the Renaissance to the Present,' through Aug. 27. This show is a dog lover's picnic, with paintings that celebrate canis lupus familiaris and its wayward ways. 1 Museum Drive, Greenwich, Conn.; (203) 869-0376. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)

Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Egypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)

* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Etienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

* International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)

* Metropolitan museum of art: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)

* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)

* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)

Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)

Museum of Biblical Art: 'The Word on the Street: the photographs of Larry Racioppo,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Johnson)

* MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)

* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)

NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/ Out of Me,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)

* The Whitney Museum of American Art : 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)

Galleries: Uptown

* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)

* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

* HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.' This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith)

* Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naive immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

* 'A Four-Dimensional Being Writes Poetry on a Field with Sculptures' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West Second Street, (212) 243-0200, through Aug. 11. (Johnson)

'Small Wonders' Bucking the big-picture trend, this absorbing show presents 45 black-and-white photographs ranging from palm to postage-stamp size. They include classic portraits by Edward Weston and Berenice Abbott; Andre Kertesz's William-Blake-like image of a naked man walking into a field of tall grass; and Walter Auerbach's picture of Willem de Kooning's studio circa 1950. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 989-7600, through Aug. 25. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

'About Light' Some works in this show, like Sean Scully's blocky grid painting and Philip Guston's smudgy gray abstraction, absorb more than emit light. Others, including Thomas Pihl's smooth, pink monochromes; Alex Katz's small nocturnal pictures of lighted apartment-building windows; and Richard Pousette-Dart's pulsating, pointillist field, seem to glow from within. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, through Aug. 4. (Johnson)

'Air' This appealing, understated show organized by the painter Amy Sillman includes Benjamin Butler's lush, Mondrian-style painting of trees; Pat Palermo's semi-abstract drawings of wrecked cars and other curious subjects; John White Cerasulo's watercolor of a bare-chested wilderness giant; Pamela Wilson-Ryckman's flickering picture of a scattering crowd of people; and abstractions in various styles by Robert Bordo, Jenny Monick, Howard Smith, Laura Newman and Patricia Treib. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 234-8645, through July 28. (Johnson)

* CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. CRG Gallery, 535 East 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, through July 28. (Smith)

'Everywhichway' This lively show of artists working inventively between abstraction and representation includes Katherine Bradford's whimsical images of ships and the sea; Chris Martin's updated Tantric art; Sigrid Sandstrom's Arctic icescapes; suave, retro-Modernist pattern paintings by Jennifer Riley and Colin Thomson; Harvey Tulcensky's finely textured ballpoint-pen fields; and compact, sensuous ceramic slabs by Joyce Robins. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565, through July 28. (Johnson)

'I'm not here. This isn't happening' With possibly the best title of the summer season, this group show includes Michelle Lopez's canny, neo-Surrealistic sculptures; Ronnie Bass's incantatory sound-and-video installation in a simulated old ship's cabin; Terry Haggerty's mesmerizing pattern paintings; Katarina Burin's noirish combinations of watercolor and found photography; Damien Cadio's enigmatic, painterly narratives; and Jim Gaylord's explosive, loosely Cubist paintings of natural and artificial fragments. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-2388, through Aug. 4. (Johnson)Smith)

* THE NAME OF THIS SHOW IS NOT GAY ART NOW Characterized by its organizer, the artist Jack Pierson, as an ode to the passing of ''the notion of Gay Art,'' this exhibition embraces the work of about 60 artists (gay, straight and otherwise) to create a cacophonous celebration and suggest that everyone is a little bit gay, if they are lucky. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, through tomorrow. (Smith)

'The Sanctuary and the Scrum' A diverting, pluralistic show inaugurates a new Northwest Chelsea exhibition space. It includes good abstract and semi-abstract paintings by Jessica Dickinson and Andrew Guenther; a stuffed swan shorn of its feathers from the head down by Jane Benson; a gleaming crutch covered by tiny mirror facets by Kristian Kozul; and a funny photo-conceptual project about grocery store shopping carts by Julian Montague. Black & White, 636 West 28th Street, (212) 244-3007, through July 29. (Johnson)

Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson)

* Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the famed modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter)

Other Galleries

'How I Finally Accepted Fate' The memoir is the loosely defined theme of this interesting 10-person show. It includes Matt Keegan's video of cheerleaders celebrating his grandmother's 90th birthday; Angela Dufresne's vivid painting of a shirtless man called ''Me as a Communist Male in 'The Red and the White' ''; Carolee Schneemann's patchwork tale about modern love in photographs and typewritten words; and Maureen Duncan's three-and-a-half-hour monologue about her CD collection. EFA Gallery, 323 West 39th Street, (212) 563-5855, through July 28. (Johnson)

Christine Osinski: 'Notes From West Brighton' Ms. Osinski took the visually and sociologically gripping photographs in this exhibition on Staten Island, where she lives, in the early 1980's and the early 90's. These exceptionally lucid black-and-white pictures of nondescript neighborhoods, grocery store customers, small-town parades, self-consciously posing teenagers and abandoned wrecked cars were made with an affectionately cool, clear eye for the beauty and weirdness of ordinary people and places. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, East Village, (212) 505-9156, through July 30. (Johnson)

Last Chance

Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black-and-white grid painted on the walls, a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design, and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love,'' depicting the goddess of love and the god of war in an intimate moment brokered by Cupid, as Mars's sexy horse looks on. The other works are a little more staid, but the painting in them is equally gorgeous. (See above.) 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, closes Sunday. (Glueck)

EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166; closes tomorrow. (Glueck)

Cosima von Bonin: 'Relax, It's Only a Ghost' Various two- and three-dimensional objects -- including stuffed animals like the ones you might find in a high-end toy store -- and Rorschach test patterns stitched to colorful bedspreads add up to a familiar critique of consumerism. Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467; closes today. (Johnson)

Invisible Might: Works from 1965-1971' This luminous group show about the euphoric convergence of Minimalism and new technologies in the late 1960's and early 70's includes a smoky glass cube by Larry Bell; a solid black plastic cube by John McCracken; a tall, clear acrylic prism by Robert Irwin; a beautiful aqua-green light projection by James Turrell; a yellow molded plastic relief by Craig Kauffman; and a corner composition of elastic cords and bent metal rods by Fred Sandback. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212) 995-1785; closes today. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: As Bonds Faces Possible Day in Court, Selig Faces a Quandary

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
EARLIER in the season, Barry Bonds's chase of Babe Ruth was the focus of baseball enthusiasts. These days, the focus is still on Bonds, but it has nothing to do with him hitting home runs. Now the focus is on the government's pursuit of Bonds.
 The growing feeling is that the government, specifically the United States attorney in San Francisco, will get him. The grand jury investigating the possibility that Bonds lied to another grand jury two and a half years ago did not act yesterday. It is scheduled to meet again Thursday. 
Bonds plods on, experiencing his worst season since 1989 and moving toward Hank Aaron's career home run record more slowly than a tortoise. He could be indicted before he hits another home run for the San Francisco Giants. He could wind up in jail before he reaches the Hall of Fame.
 The immediate question, though, isn't Bonds's guilt or innocence. It's whether Commissioner Bud Selig will take disciplinary action against Bonds if he is indicted on charges of perjury, tax evasion, money laundering, evading banking laws or anything else. 
 Selig has repeatedly refused to discuss Bonds, most recently in Pittsburgh the day before the All-Star Game at a meeting with baseball writers. 
 But an official in the commissioner's office, granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the situation, said the commissioner was torn in his considerations of the matter. One minute, Selig is prepared to suspend Bonds; the next, he changes his mind. 
 Selig could use an alternative plan. He could induce the Giants to pressure Bonds to step aside while continuing to be paid, so he could concentrate on the preparation of his defense. That's often an approach used in the corporate world.
 Given the allegations of steroid use surrounding the prodigious increase in Bonds's home run production from 2000 through 2004, many fans and politicians may very well call for Selig to suspend Bonds and erase his records. 
 ''I think that it's very difficult to imagine that he can do anything until the criminal case is disposed of,'' Fay Vincent, Selig's predecessor as the commissioner, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think some people will be screaming that he should suspend Bonds, but I don't think the union will permit that. I don't think it's a viable alternative under the collective-bargaining agreement.''
 Richard Moss, who once fought Vincent over a suspension of Steve Howe, agreed with him this time.
 ''It would be very improper'' if Bonds were suspended, Moss said, ''because he would prejudice the legal proceeding. Until there is some finality, it would be improper for the commissioner to do anything.''
 James Quinn, a New York lawyer, who has represented sports unions and players, also said Selig could not do anything until Bonds was proven guilty. Quinn cited a precedent, a case involving Bernard King, whose suspension by the N.B.A.'s Utah Jazz for an alleged improper relationship with a woman was overturned.
 The baseball commissioner, under the labor agreement, can suspend a player for just cause, but the player can challenge the action through a grievance procedure. More often than not, arbitrators have overturned or curtailed suspensions by the commissioner.
 Bonds, with the union's support, would unquestionably challenge a suspension. The union would argue that Selig did not have just cause because Bonds hadn't been convicted of any crime.
 But Selig could act under his ''best interests of baseball'' authority, finding that allowing Bonds to continue to participate in games, especially on the road, would create potentially dangerous circumstances for him and players who would be on the field with him. 
 Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis yanked Joe Medwick of the St. Louis Cardinals out of a game in the 1934 World Series -- ''for his own safety'' -- because Detroit fans unleashed a barrage of fruit and other garbage at him after he slid roughly into third base. Baseball didn't have a union then to protest Landis's action.
 The union today may have a more difficult task in overcoming a suspension on the basis of safety. Not only would safety be involved, but ugly scenes at ballparks could have a detrimental economic effect on the game. 
 To discipline an employee in a case involving conduct away from the workplace, a company would probably have to demonstrate that the employee's actions caused economic damage to the employer. 
 An arbitrator overturned Commissioner Bowie Kuhn's suspension of pitcher Ferguson Jenkins after a drug arrest in 1980 in part because Jenkins had been placed on administrative leave and the arbitrator found that management had demonstrated no effect on baseball's business.
 Fans aren't likely to stop attending games or watching them on television if Bonds is indicted. While San Francisco fans would probably continue to support him, fans of opposing teams would probably become nastier to him than they have been. 
 Bonds's absence for any part of the rest of the season would slow his march toward Aaron's record. Bonds, who will be 42 on July 24, has 720 career home runs, including 12 this season, a pace that would give him 22 for a full season. At that rate, he would have to play into the 2008 season to get to Aaron's 755.
 Indictment, conviction and jail would slow his quest even more.

HEADLINE: Development Corporations Dispute Criticism Over Their Handing Out of 9/11 Federal Aid

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
Government watchdogs on Thursday criticized the Empire State Development Corporation and its subsidiary, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, for the way the two entities disbursed certain federal grants after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
 But the criticisms, which came on the final day of Congressional hearings into the waste and mismanagement of federal dollars that streamed into New York City after the attack, were not limited to state entities or the programs intended to benefit New Yorkers.
A federal loan program for small businesses affected by the attacks, for instance, was singled out by one committee member as particularly nettlesome since it was opened to merchants across the nation and, in one case, guaranteed $635,000 for a frozen custard stand in the area of Austin, Tex. So said Representative Michael T. McCaul, a Republican from Texas who spoke at the hearings conducted by a House subcommittee in charge of management and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security. 
 The loan to the custard stand represented only a small part of the $47 million in loans given to Austin-area businesses, including a car repair shop and a shoe store, officials said.
 ''There were a lot of examples that showed minimal involvement or minimal effect by the disaster,'' Eric M. Thorson, the inspector general of the federal Small Business Association, said regarding audits of the federal loan program from the Supplemental Terrorist Activity Relief Act, better known as STAR. He warned, however, that it was hard to quickly identify the far-reaching effects on businesses hurt in the attacks.
 Like some other economic assistance systems in place in the days after the terrorist attacks nearly five years ago, the STAR program was bedeviled by loose rules and faulty oversight, officials said. 
 In her testimony, Ruth A. Ritzema, the special agent in New York in charge of the inspector general's office of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, focused on the $700 million allocated to the Empire State Development Corporation and the $2.78 billion that went to the entity it spawned after 9/11, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Audits of $1 billion worth of disbursements included ''findings of duplication of benefits and payments, of overpayments, of ineligible and unsupported costs, and of improvements needed in collection efforts,'' she said.
 Officials from both development corporations defended their efforts to assist small businesses and improve the economy in Lower Manhattan in the days after the attack on the World Trade Center, saying the criticisms seemed out of context. 
 Specifically, Eileen Mildenberger, Empire State's chief operating officer, said any notion that companies could not get both small business loans and development corporation business recovery grants was wrong. 
 ''Companies were eligible for either or both as long as they could substantiate enough economic loss,'' she said. ''The point is, they were not going to be enriched beyond their losses.''
 Of the 1,400 companies that got both forms of assistance, six did not sustain enough economic loss to get both, and so $58,000 that was initially lost in a $573 million program was later recovered, she said.
 A spokesman for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation said that internal monitors had identified about $160,000 worth of problematic spending in the residential grant program before federal auditors called it into question. And roughly half of that, or $75,000 out of a $2.8 billion program, has now been recovered, he said.
 Stefan Pryor, the president of the Lower Manhattan entity, told lawmakers that HUD's inspector general, in testimony to the Senate two weeks ago, praised the Lower Manhattan corporation's fraud-busting abilities as an effective concept for those engaged in continuing disaster relief efforts in the Gulf region.
 Over all, said Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island and the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, the most egregious things he had heard were related to the criminals who preyed on the good will of many, including those in government, like ''people who were claiming dead relatives or who were having phony memorial services.''
 Mr. King added: ''It's a wake-up call that we have to be more alert to that in the future, that no matter how terrible something is, no matter how tragic it is, no matter how much we think everyone is dedicated to doing the right thing, that there are people out there who are just trying to game the system from the first moment.''

HEADLINE: Feel Relieved? Not So Fast, Partner

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FIVE summers ago, a car bomb exploded in Netanya, an Israeli city on the Mediterranean, and everyone's first reaction was to fear the worst. It had to be another terrorist attack, people figured. Netanya, lying a mere 10 miles from the West Bank, had become all too vulnerable to Palestinian suicide bombers.
 But assumptions turned out to be wrong. The attack, which proved nonfatal, was the work of Israeli criminals, the police said. One mobster had tried to do in another. 
What a relief, people said; it wasn't terrorism. ''I prefer a criminal attack,'' Yehuda Madar of Netanya told me at the time.
 These days, New York has that in common with faraway Netanya.
 Bad things happen here, some bearing the potential for a huge loss of life. But as long as they are not the work of terrorists in search of martyrdom or who knows what, our reaction tends to be the same as it was in Netanya: Whew! We dodged a bullet.
 We experienced the phenomenon this week after an explosion destroyed a town house on East 62nd Street and wounded a few people, including the doctor who owned the property. First came fears of terrorism. Then came relieved sighs. From what the police say, the doctor, chasing whatever demons, may have blown up his own house. What a lucky break for us, most New Yorkers said.
 But why the high fives? With an altered circumstance or two -- say, people walking by at the wrong moment -- dozens could have been killed.
 The fact is that, despite the terror and high body count of Sept. 11, 2001, New Yorkers are far more likely to be maimed or killed by a deranged fellow citizen than by someone with a Qaeda decoder ring.
 A few weeks ago, a man wounded four people during a 13-hour stabbing spree in Manhattan. Five people were stabbed in a similar rampage last year, three others in yet another attack the year before. Remember the driver who went on a hit-and-run spree in Midtown four years ago, killing a pedestrian and injuring two dozen others? Barely a weekend passes without some drunken dope losing control of his car and killing three, four, five or more innocents. The list is long.
 So why do we derive comfort from knowing that a disaster is caused by a disturbed soul or a souse? Mayhem is mayhem. And unless New York undergoes radical change, we are likely to have many more demented people among us than terrorists.
 ''We tend to underreact to risks that are familiar -- they kind of recede into the background -- and overreact to risks that are new, in part because we don't know how bad they are,'' said George Loewenstein, a professor of psychology and economics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Car wrecks and people going crazy -- those are ''known risks,'' Dr. Loewenstein said. But terrorism, 9/11 notwithstanding, still falls into an ''unknown-risk category,'' and that is scary.
 Paul Slovic, a psychologist who is president of Decision Research, a research institution in Eugene, Ore., said that ''terrorist acts unnerve us because they do not follow the normal 'disaster plot,' which has a beginning, middle and end. We don't know what the scope of the planned aggression is.''
 ''Terrorism, perverse as it is, has a rationality to it,'' Dr. Slovic said. ''This seems worse than the deeds of one who is 'not in their right mind.' The 'right mind' of the terrorist wants to terrorize us.''
 With the town house explosion, there is an added factor, said Anthony R. Mawson, a professor of public health at Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss. Many people, he said, view the doctor as ''a man to be pitied rather than one to be feared.''
 BUT what if that attitude were to change? What if we began to regard the one who caused the explosion, whoever he was, as no better than a terrorist?
 Dr. Kerry J. Sulkowicz, a Manhattan psychoanalyst, said he would not be surprised if some New Yorkers now walk nervously past town houses wondering if they might go boom. ''It is, of course, highly unlikely,'' Dr. Sulkowicz said. ''But that's the effect of terrorism, to make people think that way.''
 For now anyway, we remain in Netanya mode: relieved that what occurred on 62nd Street falls comfortably into ''the not-threatening-to-me category,'' as Dr. Loewenstein put it.
 It might be worth noting, though, that bombs have gone off in Netanya several times in the last few years, with casualties in the dozens. That feeling of relief? It didn't last long.

HEADLINE: Accused G.I. Was Troubled Long Before Iraq

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER and ROBERT F. WORTH; Reporting for this article was contributed by Thayer Evans in Seabrook, Tex.; Carolyn Marshall in Fort Campbell, Ky.; and Barbara Novovitch in Denver City, Tex. Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.

 BODY:
On the last day of January 2005, Steven D. Green, the former Army private accused of raping a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and murdering her family, sat in a Texas jail on alcohol-possession charges, an unemployed 19-year-old high school dropout who had just racked up his third misdemeanor conviction. 
 Days later, Mr. Green enlisted in a soldier-strapped Army, and was later assigned to a star-crossed unit to serve on an especially murderous patch of earth.
 He arrived at the very moment that the Army was increasing by nearly half the rate at which it granted what it calls ''moral waivers'' to potential recruits. The change opened the ranks to more people like Mr. Green, those with minor criminal records and weak educational backgrounds. In Mr. Green's case, his problems were emerging by junior high school, say people who knew him then. 
 Mr. Green's Army waiver allowed a troubled young man into the heart of a war that bore little resemblance to its original declared purposes, but which continued to need thousands of fresh recruits. 
 Now, there is shame and rage in the Army -- from the ranks of the enlisted to the officer corps -- over the crimes attributed to Mr. Green, who was discharged in April on psychiatric grounds, and four other soldiers charged with a rape and four killings in March in Mahmudiya, a town about 20 miles south of Baghdad. A sixth soldier was charged with failing to report the matter after learning about it.
 Mr. Green's commanding officer, Lt. Col. Thomas Kunk, told his brother in a recent letter that ''his worst fears, the nightmare every commander dreams of, has basically come true,'' the brother, Peter Kunk, said in an interview describing the letter. 
 ''The three or four people have apparently been involved in a situation that reflects so badly on the Army and all the people in these brigades and companies,'' Mr. Kunk said.
 In early 2005, a few weeks after enlisting, Private Green immersed himself in a baptismal pool in the back of an Army chapel in Fort Benning, Ga., one of hundreds of young recruits who embraced religion as they faced certain violence. 
 By year's end, Private Green, then 20, was patrolling streets in one of the most bloodily contested corridors of Iraq, the so-called ''triangle of death'' south of Baghdad where thousands had died in sectarian violence since 2003. He served with Bravo Company, First Battalion, 502nd Infantry, part of the Army's 101st Division.
 In a photograph released by the Army on Dec. 9, Private Green can be seen laden with gear and aiming a weapon at a lock at an abandoned house. One of his sergeants, Ken Casica, was quoted on the subject of house searches in a news release that accompanied the picture. 
 The next day, Sergeant Casica and Sgt. Travis Nelson, also of Bravo Company, were shot dead at a checkpoint. Less than two weeks later, two more members of the company were killed by a roadside bomb. 
 Steven Green lasted only another four months in the Army, but it was a grim, violent and chaotic stretch. Seventeen battalion members were killed, two of them mutilated after being kidnapped; of those killed, eight belonged to Mr. Green's Bravo Company of about 110 soldiers. 
 Even the modest quarters taken over the Bravo Company, an abandoned potato warehouse, burned to the ground in an accidental fire, destroying letters, video players, and the small personal tokens the soldiers had slipped into their war gear.
 Mr. Kunk, the brother of the commanding officer of the battalion, said that Colonel Kunk had regarded this deployment as the most brutal stretch of his 22 years in the service.
 ''This is the toughest tour of duty he has ever had,'' Mr. Kunk said. ''You can tell by his letters. It has taken a terrible toll on him and his men. We're heartsick about it. There's been so many deaths, loss of limbs, injuries.''
 Born May 2, 1985, Steven Dale Green spent some of his earliest years in Midland, Tex., in the western part of the state. His parents, John Green and Roxanne Simolke, divorced while he was a child, and Mr. Green moved with his mother to Seabrook, southeast of Houston on the Gulf Coast. She married Daniel Carr when Steven was around 8. 
 Willy Godfrey, a classmate of Mr. Green at Seabrook Intermediate School, remembered when Mr. Green moved into the area for sixth grade in 1997.
 ''He was always, like, in trouble, doing something in school,'' said Mr. Godfrey, 21, an emergency medical technician. ''He was always getting into a fight or saying something mean to a teacher. Something weird. It was just out of place. Gradewise and stuff, I don't know if he did good or bad. But he did not mix well with other people. He was basically mad, or something like that.''
 Lisa Godfrey, Mr. Godfrey's mother, said she had worked with Mr. Green's mother at Seabrook Classic Cafe and they had spoken often about their boys. His mother had trouble with Steven, Ms. Godfrey, 46, said.
 ''He was disruptive in his house,'' she said. ''I don't know if he killed small cats or anything, but that's the kind of kid he was. His mom had a lot of issues.''
 Another schoolmate, Danielle Mundine, said Mr. Green used drugs at an unusually young age for Seabrook. ''I think he did drugs and drink in junior high school,'' Ms. Mundine, 19, said. ''He did have some friends.''
 In 2000, Mr. Green's mother spent six months in jail on a drunken-driving conviction, records show. Around that time, Mr. Green returned to Midland, where his father still lived. There, he attended Viola M. Coleman High School, which offers courses for students who have difficulty with regular academic programs. He dropped out by 2002, around the 10th grade, but received a graduate equivalency diploma in 2003 from Midland Community College.
 Mr. Green was convicted in October 2001 of possession of drug paraphernalia and fined $350. Five months later, he was charged as a minor in possession of tobacco, and was fined $300, according to records in Midland Municipal Court. On Jan. 31, 2005, he was arrested and charged as a minor in possession of alcohol, and again was fined $350. This time, he did not pay the fine, but served jail time.
 ''He laid off the fine in jail,'' Sheriff Gary Painter of Midland County said. Mr. Green did not volunteer to work in the kitchen or at other jobs, which would have shortened his stay, Sheriff Painter said. He served four days.
 The jail records hint at some complications in his family life. Mr. Green did not list either parent as a contact, but listed a man in Denver City, Tex., about 80 miles away. Sheriff Painter said he was not permitted to release the name of the contact. But Mr. Green had lived in Denver City with Daniel Carr, his former stepfather, who was estranged from Mr. Green's mother. 
 In Denver City, B. J. Carr, the father of Daniel Carr, said Mr. Green had lived there with his son, who works in oil fields in Oklahoma.
 The Army has released little information about its review of Mr. Green's background before he joined the service. 
 The share of Army recruits who received ''moral waivers'' for criminal records increased last year and through the first half of 2006 by 15 percent from 10 percent or 11 percent before the war, according to statistics released this week. (According to the Pentagon, the number of waivers in 2001 totaled 7,640. The figure increased to 11,018 in 2005, and for the first six months of this fiscal year totaled 5,636.)
 Asked how the Green situation might apply to someone who tried to enlist today, Douglas Smith, a spokesman for the Army Recruiting Command at Fort Knox, Ky., said it was not possible to apply the Army's standards to a hypothetical case. 
 ''A waiver is based on the actuality of the person, the totality of their life, the information we have on them -- what have been their shortcomings, what have they done in their life to overcome a previous minor mistake,'' Mr. Smith said. 
 On March 13, two months afte he was released from the Midland jail, Mr. Green was one of eight soldiers baptized during a Church of Christ service at Fort Benning. 
 ''You hold that weapon for the first time, a lot of guys are holding weapons for the first time in their lives, and you know this M-16 is meant for engaging the enemy,'' said Jason Garber, 19, who was baptized that day but did not complete training. ''You wonder, if I do die, where am I going to go?''
 A year later almost to the day, a federal criminal complaint says, Mr. Green and the four other soldiers charged in the case drank alcohol, changed into black clothes and then raided the home of a husband and wife and their two daughters. 
 Mr. Green, the complaint charges, went into a room and killed the parents and the younger daughter. Then, it says, he and a second soldier sexually assaulted the 14-year-old, shot her and tried to burn her body.

HEADLINE: A Nation-Building Project Comes Apart in East Timor

BYLINE: By Jane Perlez

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 13 

 BODY:
When he was inaugurated as president of East Timor in 2002, Xanana Gusmao, a poet and former political prisoner, named his headquarters -- a glorified bungalow really -- the Palace of Ashes. It was a reminder of the ruin Indonesian troops left as they rampaged their way out of the territory after a bloodstained occupation. Mr. Gusmao was also signaling hopes for a new beginning. 
 Born in the wake of Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia and Haiti, East Timor was to be the new nation that succeeded, a United Nations-administered, multibillion-dollar project that would avoid the mistakes that doomed nation-building elsewhere. 
But now, with the rebuilding effort in tatters, people are asking whether East Timor has any future at all as an independent nation. Can another makeover by the United Nations work? Or will the country of about one million people who subsist on some of the world's least arable land become a perpetual ward of the world? 
 This week a United Nations team of legal, political and military experts flew back to New York after investigating what caused the breakdown in law and order, the recent disintegration of the police force and the army, the sudden emergence of ethnic hostilities and the flight of more than 100,000 people to makeshift refugee camps. 
 One thing seems sure: The United Nations effort from 1999 to 2002 was too brief -- known as Quickfixville at the time -- and was fraught with mistakes that previous experience could not have prepared officials for, given the particular circumstances of East Timor's history and society. 
 At his swearing in on Monday, the new prime minister, Jose Ramos-Horta, noted: ''If it is not possible to make a small business viable in two years, consolidate it and make it commercially sustainable in two years, yet we ask, 'Is it possible to build a state in two years?' The answer is no.'' 
 An ambitious diplomat -- Mr. Ramos-Horta said Monday that he was still a candidate to lead the United Nations in 2012 -- the new prime minister was too politic to add that the United States was at the forefront of insisting that United Nations peacekeepers and military and police trainers not overstay the original plan. 
 East Timor emerged from a 1999 independence referendum with a colonial heritage of four centuries of Portuguese rule followed by nearly two decades under the thumb of the Indonesian military. The Roman Catholic Church maintains a strong influence on all social issues. Australia, separated from East Timor at its northern edge by several hundred miles of sea, also takes an interest, motivated in part by the bravery of East Timorese who saved Australian paratroopers from the Japanese during World War II. 
 The exiles who returned to govern after independence brought divergent ideas: one group, led by Mari Alkatiri, who recently resigned as prime minister, spent years in Marxist Mozambique. His successor, Mr. Ramos-Horta, acquired the patois of international-speak as he moved in diplomatic circles for 24 years. The charismatic Mr. Gusmao has few powers as president under a new Constitution modeled on Portugal's. 
 The mosaic of outside influences has left a bizarre stamp on everyday life in Dili, the languid port town that serves as the capital, a pervasive feeling of second choices taken because better alternatives were too difficult or inconvenient. 
 Hundreds of teachers have to be imported from Portugal every year to teach elementary school students Portuguese, which was chosen as the official language even though East Timor is part of the world of Asia and the Pacific and much of the population is illiterate. The almost dysfunctional judicial system was conceived and written by the Portuguese, and it now creaks along in their language. In the absence of an official currency, American dollars are used as a way to avoid more distasteful alternatives like the Indonesian rupiah or the Australian dollar. 
 Hundreds of Cuban doctors serve as the core of a strapped medical service. In return, much to the annoyance of the American Embassy in Dili, East Timorese medical students are trained in Cuba under a program arranged by Mr. Alkatiri. 
 Almost everyone agrees that the fatal flaw in the East Timor experiment came with the creation of a national army and police force. In many respects, the building of an army had less to do with national defense than with creating a home for demobilized freedom fighters where they would be paid, watched over and kept in uniform. 
 Hugh White, a former senior official at the Australian Department of Defense, said that Australia was well aware of the problems of building an East Timorese army, that it was easy to foresee that it would fracture along ethnic and political lines. A large, well-trained police force would have been sufficient, he said. 
 But Australia went along with the idea of building a new military, and trained some of its officers in Australia, because it did not want to cede all power to Portugal. ''The Portuguese were prepared to put enough resources into an army without Australia's resources,'' Mr. White recalled. ''We felt if they said yes, and we didn't, we'd lose the opportunity to influence the army. In the end our minister said yes.''
 Factions in the army and the police fought one another in the past several months, and splinter groups of the police and the army aligned themselves with various political figures. Now the police force, which experts say was particularly poorly trained, and the army are in shreds. Mr. White estimates that several thousand weapons are floating around East Timor. ''In a country of 925,000, that's very destabilizing,'' he said. 
 Although most East Timorese are dirt-poor farmers, little effort was made to improve basic agriculture during the United Nations administration. Most of the resources were devoted to building government institutions, said James J. Fox, an anthropologist at Australian National University and an expert on East Timor.
 Mr. Fox said he had tried to persuade the United Nations to spend more on the rural economy, where productivity is the lowest in Asia, but to no avail. ''We were pushing on agriculture, but it wasn't as sexy as justice and security,'' he said. 
 Will East Timor ever be able to make it on its own? ''I'm very gloomy,'' Mr. White said. ''Its viability is on the knife edge. It would take a remarkable performance, quite uncharacteristic of what we've seen so far on such a feeble base, to get East Timor back on the rails.''

HEADLINE: A City in Decline Fighting to Preserve Its 1800's Heritage 

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: UTICA, N.Y., July 13 

 BODY:
The decline of the Mr. Lamp Building began long before a rainstorm in June 2005 ripped off part of its mansard roof. 
 Rain poured in, and part of the western wall collapsed onto the sidewalk. No one stepped forward to pay for the repairs, which were estimated to cost at least $180,000, and in October, the Mr. Lamp Building, which dated from the 1870's, was torn down. To Utica's preservationists, the demolition was emblematic. They said that over the years, the city had lost about 40 percent of its 19th-century buildings -- demolished after years of neglect, set on fire by arsonists or sacrificed for urban renewal projects and municipal parking lots.
''Utica has lost an awful lot of historic buildings, and some of those buildings that were torn down would make you cry, they were so beautiful,'' said Michael Bosak of the Landmarks Society of Greater Utica. ''We want to stop the deterioration.'' 
 So earlier this year, the Landmarks Society, which puts out a list each year of a dozen or so at-risk buildings, declared that so many of the remaining historical buildings were falling into disrepair that the architectural integrity of the entire city, once a thriving center for textiles and beer, was endangered.
 ''The decision was difficult for numerous reasons,'' Michael S. Rizzo, the society's president, said in an e-mail message. ''First, we had to grasp and understand the idea. Could an entire city really be endangered? After we digested that, and believed it to be true, we knew we would face criticism and lose favor from those that can't see the big picture.''
 With the declaration, the Landmarks Society, a volunteer group, said it hoped to push city officials and private property owners into redoubling their efforts to save historic structures. But as Mr. Rizzo predicted, the society has been criticized. In an editorial published on June 5, The Utica Observer-Dispatch called it ineffective: ''Saying that the entire city's stock of historical buildings is at risk sends the unintended message that the problem is too vast, too impossible to solve.''
 Mr. Bosak, the chairman of the society's endangered buildings committee, argued that the problem could be solved if city and county officials would enforce codes more strictly, with an eye to preventing buildings from getting into such bad shape that they become hazardous and have to be torn down. He said that the city itself was too quick to raze buildings for parking lots and that even one loss in a historic neighborhood could destroy its architectural fabric.
 The owner of the Mr. Lamp Building, Richard Grzesik Sr., had tried to fix it up in the six years that he owned it, said his wife, Anna. He had renovated the first floor and put his electrical-supply business there, leading to the building's nickname. But the demands of the old structure were unrelenting, and then Mr. Grzesik, who was 73, learned that he had cancer. 
 The Grzesiks were unable to pay for major repairs, and since the building had been neglected for decades before they bought it, their insurance company denied a claim. City officials and preservationists tried to broker a deal, but the family initially turned down a $75,000 purchase offer. 
 The estimate of the cost of the repairs rose to $180,000 at a minimum -- double what everyone had guessed. The Grzesiks changed their minds and tried to accept the purchase offer, but the investors had backed away.
 After three months of failed negotiations and fears of further collapse, municipal officials decided to demolish the building and charge the $100,000 cost to the owners. Two weeks before the building came down, Mr. Grzesik died. 
 Despite the loss of the Mr. Lamp Building and the alarm raised by the Landmarks Society, Mayor Timothy Julian said the city was doing its best. ''The Landmarks Society has a love-hate relationship with me,'' he said. ''They would like to save absolutely everything, and we can't afford to do it.''
 In years past, the city has made temporary repairs on privately owned buildings and sold repossessed buildings to nonprofit groups, even though nonprofit groups are exempt from taxes. Recently, it has come up with a plan to train firefighters to assist in time-consuming code enforcement.
 Mayor Julian does not believe Utica's historical integrity is in jeopardy. ''This administration has done what it could,'' he said. ''They have to pick and choose.''
 In fact, the city and the Landmarks Society have been allies in saving many structures, including a 5,500-square-foot neo-Classical office building from the mid-1890's.
 The building was owned by the local Masonic Association, and 10 years ago the group applied for a permit to tear it down. Landmarks officials put it on its endangered list, and a quasi-governmental group, the Scenic and Historic Commission, refused to approve the demolition.
 Eventually, the Masons agreed to sell the building to a local lawyer, Michael J. Cancilla, who bought it for $3,000 late in 2005.
 For the past year, he has overseen about $100,000 worth of improvements, mostly relying on himself, his family and friends for the labor. But he said that the renovations accounted for less than a third of what had to be done. ''It's a lot more than what I expected,'' he said. ''Every time I touch something I have to fix it.''
 Still, he finds the renovations and the preservation worthwhile, allowing him to keep his office downtown near the courts , instead of moving into the suburbs like many of his colleagues. But he does not think his decision is for everyone. ''Some buildings are too far gone, and you can't do anything to fix them,'' he said.
 Though others may disagree, Mrs. Grzesik does not believe her late husband's building was beyond repair. ''It was my husband's, and it was a beautiful building,'' she said. ''Now they have an empty, empty lot -- like everywhere else in Utica.''

HEADLINE: The Face That Set The Market Buzzing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
GUSTAV KLIMT'S 1907 portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, acquired last month by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece in Mr. Lauder's Neue Galerie for German and Austrian art, on the Upper East Side. Jon Stewart was joking on ''The Daily Show'' the other night about what that little green patch in the corner of the picture must be worth. You can't buy publicity like that. 
 Well, maybe Mr. Lauder could. The portrait cost him the equivalent of the combined gross domestic products of Kiribati and Sao Tome and Principe.
It's a large, hallucinatory square of spectacular gold filigree. Adele looks almost as if she has inserted her head into one of those carnival cutouts, her thin face partly cast in shadow, obscured by the glare. Her lips are parted, eyelids heavy, cheeks pink. The eyes are two big, brown almonds. The overstuffed headrest of her chair makes a halo of beetle-wing delicacy. Monogrammed, her gown undulates with gently raised letters. 
 And that green patch Mr. Stewart likes so much is a glimpse of emerald floor, thrusting the picture into depth. The coup de grace is a spider web of hands, a classic Klimt touch of decadence, clasped so that one wrist bends at a rakish right angle. 
 She's half queen, half Vegas showgirl. The perfect New Yorker. 
 Welcome to town, Adele. 
 She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts owned by the Bloch-Bauer heirs, from whom the portrait was bought. They're bridesmaids in lime-green dresses, supporting players in a passing Klimt show from the family's collection. After they depart on Sept. 18, Adele will stick around, the new marquee attraction for Mr. Lauder's luxe museum, which now, thanks to her, will surely jump high up on the list of New York's must-see sites -- a mixed blessing for those who have known it as a sleeper.
 It would be churlish of art lovers in the city not to thank Mr. Lauder for the portrait that for decades was a Viennese civic symbol. Its passage, there to here, is quite a saga. Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a wealthy Jewish industrialist, commissioned Klimt to paint his wife, twice. Klimt obliged, so the story goes, by making her his mistress. Public-spirited, she willed her art to Austria. Then she died of meningitis, at 43, in 1925.
 Ferdinand had to flee the Nazis 13 years later. They seized the family's paintings; the family castle in Bohemia went to Reinhard Heydrich, the murderer of Wannsee; the family home in Vienna went to the Austrian national railway, which shipped Jews to the camps; and the diamond choker that Adele is wearing in the portrait went to Hermann Goering for his wife. Hitler apparently balked at acquiring the family porcelain. Too expensive, he said.
 And then, for more than 60 years, the Austrian government refused to return the paintings to the family, although Ferdinand had redone Adele's will. Led by his niece, Maria Altmann, now 90 and living in Los Angeles, the Bloch-Bauer heirs finally won a court battle in January.
 In a nod to the city where she settled (her lawyer, by the way, is the grandson of another exile in Hollywood, Arnold Schoenberg), Mrs. Altmann lent the pictures to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in April. Meanwhile, Mr. Lauder was negotiating the purchase of Adele, and arranging for this show to stop here.
 It includes the second Adele, painted in 1912. No longer gold and Byzantine with Egyptian flourishes, instead flowery, sketchier and brightly colored, like a Japanese print, she wears a halo made out of the brim of a huge black hat. Her dress is high-collared, not off the shoulder, her body face-forward and erect, a slender, sinuous Coke bottle shape, more chaste than carnal. This older Adele gazes at some spot just over our heads -- she's still regal but less Vegas. More Aubrey Beardsley via Edith Wharton.
 The other Bloch-Bauer pictures are landscapes; the earliest one, from 1903, of a birch forest, is exquisite: an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Its forest floor makes a mosaic of Pointillist dots, broken up by irregular vertical stripes of perfectly real trees receding into idyllic space. For Klimt, bodies were erotic, nervous subjects, ripe for pornography; landscapes were Edenic. 
 The Bloch-Bauers also acquired a picture he painted of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, where he spent summer vacations. Neither is great. But like the two Adele portraits, they raise the question whether, had he not died at 55, in 1918, Klimt would have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian. 
 The four pictures are on the market, Mrs. Altmann has said. She and her relatives are cashing in, which is their right. They offered the Austrian government a chance to buy the whole collection for about the money that Mr. Lauder reportedly spent on Adele.
 The Austrians balked. Too expensive, they said. 
 When the Metropolitan spent $5.5 million on Velazquez's portrait of Juan de Pareja in 1970, it was a scandal; now it seems cheap for one of the great paintings in the country. The sums that places like the Museum of Modern Art squander on mediocre buildings, which become obsolete the moment they open, are scandalous.
 The art market operates according to its own logic, which may have nothing to do with the quality of the art. Value is not price -- whether the issue is a Klimt, or a ballplayer, or a chief executive paid millions of dollars, who runs his company into the ground. 
 But Oscar Wilde had it right about cynics, price and value. It's only natural to play the skeptic when the art world is a circus of profligacy, drunk with cash, and when dimwitted speculators make headlines, wasting fortunes on bad art. Who knows what the most money paid in private for a painting really is: maybe $135 million. For that amount, assuming it is what Mr. Lauder paid, his portrait of Adele, a hedonistic masterpiece, will be talked about in terms of how many lives might have been saved or how many lifted from poverty for this sum. 
 It's inevitable. But ludicrous. The Met spent more than $45 million two years ago for a tiny Duccio ''Madonna and Child'' whose modesty seems its most endearing virtue. The tipping point between endearing and hedonistic is evidently somewhere around $100 million.
 As for the border separating public interest from private enterprise, it has never been fixed. The Neue Galerie is Christie's annex now, exhibiting paintings for sale ($15 general admission, no children under 12 allowed), whose display is also a public service. 
 Someday Adele will be seen for just what she is: beautiful, a gift to the city. And $135 million may even come to look like a bargain. 

The exhibition continues through Sept. 18 at Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street; (212) 628-6200 or neuegalerie.org.

HEADLINE: Blacks Speak of Isolation, but Merrill Says It's Trying to Change

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
For almost seven years, Glenn D. Capel has been a financial adviser in a busy Merrill Lynch office in Greensboro, N.C., but he says he has never felt more isolated.
 For most of his time with Merrill, Mr. Capel said, he has been the only black financial adviser among about 40 employed there, or indeed anywhere nearby. At the end of last year, he was one of only two in all of North and South Carolina, according to a racial-discrimination lawsuit against Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, that is seeking class-action status in federal court in Chicago.
''It's a lonely struggle,'' said Mr. Capel, one of dozens of current and former Merrill brokers who asked to join the suit after it was filed last year. ''Even Noah's ark had two animals that were exactly alike.''
 Wall Street has long been seen as an exclusive club, and the discrimination suit against Merrill underscores that the industry is still struggling to overcome its reputation as a workplace where only white men are comfortable. 
 In the last decade, the nation's three biggest brokerage firms -- Merrill, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup -- have paid out more than $400 million to settle sex-discrimination suits filed by women.
 In an amended complaint filed this week, the plaintiffs in the race-discrimination case contend that Merrill has systemically limited the opportunities for blacks to succeed as brokers, denied them a fair chance to rise into management and retaliated against those who complained. Some of the brokers' allegations involve offensive remarks and other slights, but the core of their complaint is economic. They are seeking a large monetary award and court-ordered initiatives to increase diversity in the ranks.
 Merrill officials dispute many of the plaintiffs' claims and say that the firm's record on diversity is above the norm for Wall Street. But they also acknowledge that the firm has had an inadequate record of hiring and promoting blacks in its brokerage operation.
 Robert J. McCann, the president of Merrill's global brokerage business, said that he and E. Stanley O'Neal, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, were dissatisfied with the firm's slow progress on diversity. ''We're not where I want us to be, where Stan wants us to be or where Merrill Lynch wants to be,'' Mr. McCann said.
 Merrill presents a diverse face to the public, whose investments it wants to manage. Mr. O'Neal is the only African-American running a major Wall Street company and his management team includes several women and minorities. A current Merrill television commercial features a black actor portraying one of the firm's successful stockbrokers.
 In reality, though, as even Merrill officials concede, black brokers at the firm are rare and successful ones are much rarer.
 The lawsuit against Merrill could be a watershed because so few complaints about racial-discrimination at Wall Street firms are litigated in public. Until recently, getting past the industry's system of mandatory arbitration and into court required enough disgruntled current and former employees to form a class. With only about 2 percent of all the brokers at the big firms being black, gathering enough of them to pursue a class action is a challenge.
 If this case is accepted as a class action, it could lead to the first trial of race-discrimination complaints against a major Wall Street firm, labor lawyers said. In another case pending in federal court, three black brokers are trying to press a discrimination class action against UBS, whose brokerage operation was previously known as PaineWebber. 
 Complaints of discrimination within Merrill have existed for more than 30 years. The firm is still wrapping up a drawn-out legal battle with more than 900 women who worked for it. In the mid-1970's, Merrill settled another discrimination suit by promising that it would increase the racial and sexual diversity of its broker ranks, but the firm repeatedly fell short, saying that the goals it had agreed to were impossible to meet. 
 Only 128 of Merrill's full-fledged financial advisers were black at the end of last year out of the more than 14,000 sales people in its brokerage operations, according to an amended complaint filed this week. Merrill, which employs 55,000, has brokers in every state, but the suit contends that in more than half of them, including Massachusetts, Indiana and Mississippi, the firm did not employ one black financial adviser at year-end.
 Among black Merrill brokers with at least 10 years of experience, half ranked in the bottom fifth in 2003 when it came to producing revenue for the firm, which is the main determinant of a broker's income, according to the amended complaint. Among those with six to nine years' experience, more than half were in the bottom fifth and none were in the top fifth, the complaint contends. 
 While acknowledging the need to improve, Mr. McCann and other Merrill officials insist that the firm's diversity record exceeds the industry norm.
 Blacks now account for 2.3 percent -- about one in 45 -- of the firm's brokers and broker-trainees, Mr. McCann said. ''Am I happy with 2.3 percent of my F.A.'s being African-Americans?'' he said. ''No.''
 Mr. McCann also conceded that ''there is an over-representation of African-American F.A.'s in the lower quintiles'' of production. But he added that the firm had some highly successful black financial advisers who do not share the plaintiffs' complaints, although the firm declined to make one of them available to comment for this article.
 In the last few months, Merrill's lawyers and some of its senior executives held several negotiating sessions with the lead plaintiff, George R. McReynolds, a longtime broker from Nashville, and a group of other brokers who have supported the suit he filed last fall. But those talks ended with no agreement last month.
 Mr. McReynolds is represented by Mary Stowell and Linda D. Friedman, the same Chicago lawyers who brought the sex-discrimination class action that has cost Merrill more than $200 million.
 Visibly frustrated by the impasse, Mr. McCann said Merrill had made a generous offer and was willing to continue negotiating. But, he added, the plaintiff lawyers had been asking for far more than the firm would agree to pay. Neither side would discuss the specific offers or demands.
 Leaning forward from an armchair in his spacious office suite in the World Financial Center, Mr. McCann rattled off the moves he has made to address the situation, including installing a black investment banker, Colbert Narcisse, as the chief operating officer of the brokerage unit and head of a new ''office of diversity.'' 
 Mr. McCann said he had also increased the financial rewards and punishments Merrill managers can receive for their success or failure at hiring and developing black financial advisers. (Only a few of the supervisors in Merrill's network of more than 600 branches are black.) 
 Since the suit was filed in November, Merrill has been hiring African-Americans at an unusually fast pace, according to black brokers at the firm. In the Detroit area, for example, Merrill had as few as 3 black brokers last year, but now has as many as 14, these brokers said.
 Merrill officials said the firm now had at least one black broker in 35 states, 207 full-fledged brokers and wealth-management advisers who are black and an additional 123 African-Americans who are working toward being designated financial advisers. Mr. McCann said that 40 percent of the current crop of trainees came from ''diverse backgrounds.'' But Merrill uses that term to include all minorities, as well as white women and gays.
 Racial breakdowns of each brokerage firm's employees are not available for comparison. In December 2005, the Securities Industry Association published a survey that reported that blacks accounted for about 2 percent of all brokers, or about one in 50. But in their suit, the plaintiffs cite 2000 census data in contending that blacks made up 3.15 percent of the sales forces of all securities brokers and dealers other than Merrill.
 Either way, black brokers who have asked to join the suit said they expected more from an industry leader like Merrill. 
 ''When I heard Merrill Lynch was addressing their problems, I didn't think there was any other place to be,'' said Leroy R. Brown, a financial adviser in Punta Gorda, Fla., who joined the firm in 1978, left briefly but returned. 
 Since he moved to Florida from New Jersey a few years ago, Mr. Brown said, he has been reminded of the isolation he felt early in his career as the lone black broker in the firm's office in downtown Newark. He recalled having so much success that he earned a trip to one of Merrill's annual gatherings at a Florida resort, only to find he was the firm's sole black representative.
 ''Just me and the Four Tops,'' Mr. Brown said, referring to the singing group that had been hired to entertain at the event. He said he declined to attend similar events after that.
 In 28 years at Merrill, he said, he has never had an immediate supervisor who was black, and now, again, he is the lone black financial adviser in his branch office. What he wants most of all from Merrill, he said, is an acknowledgment of the higher hurdles he had to clear to survive as long as he has at the firm.
 Mr. Brown, 60, was supposed to be part of a new wave of hires by Merrill after it signed a consent decree with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that called for it to be more welcoming to women and minorities. The commission sued Merrill in 1976, contending that it had engaged in ''a pattern and practice'' of discrimination.
 At the time, Merrill's sales force was composed almost exclusively of white men, mostly ambitious sons of the middle and working classes with a gift for selling stocks and bonds. After failing to meet the hiring goals set forth in the original settlement with the E.E.O.C., Merrill agreed to try again in the early 1980's. It pledged that in every year from 1983 through 1987, one of every 15 broker trainees it hired would be black. But the agreement eventually expired with the goals unmet.
 Mr. Brown, Mr. Capel and other brokers said their isolation had become more of a detriment in recent years as Merrill's managers encouraged brokers to form teams, pooling resources and sharing expertise. Teams tend to stand ahead of individual brokers in line when managers redistribute the client accounts of departing brokers, they said. Missing out on those handouts can leave brokers at a competitive disadvantage and contribute to a cycle of relative underperformance.
 ''I've seen teams form all around me, but I've never been invited to join a team,'' Mr. Capel said. ''It's a flawed system.''
 Mr. McCann, the Merrill executive, said he would not encourage managers to intervene in the teaming of brokers. ''In the end, we can't do it for anybody,'' he said. ''This is a business of self-starters, a business of entrepreneurs.'' 
 Frankie L. Ross, 55, says he has more seniority than all seven of the other aspiring black brokers who have passed through Merrill's office in Berkeley, Calif., in the 20 years he has worked there.
 ''I've been in this office a long time and sometimes you feel like you aren't going to be asked to be on anybody's team because you are African-American,'' Mr. Ross said. ''One of the things that Merrill can do, and they've had many opportunities to do it, is to try to understand what it's like to be the only African-American in an office, the only African-American in a state.''
 He said he was impressed by the rise in minority hiring at Merrill in the last year, an improvement he attributed to the move toward making diversity a component of managers' pay.
 ''Now that they get paid, it's amazing how they can find African-Americans to hire,'' Mr. Ross said.

HEADLINE: Politics Aside, It's Business as Usual for Mexican Business 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 13 

 BODY:
Mexico's political class is riveted by every twist in the country's contested presidential election. But Wall Street has already moved on. 
 Election officials say that Felipe Calderon, the market-friendly candidate, squeezed out a tiny margin of victory. But the leftist candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has refused to accept the election results and demanded a recount. Analysts at investment banks are predicting that the country's nascent democratic institutions will withstand the upheaval and that Mr. Calderon will prevail.
Indeed, in the almost two weeks since the July 2 election, the peso has been stable. The stock market has zigzagged, but analysts say Mexico's index is driven more by global concerns than domestic politics. The Bolsa fell 3.57 percent on Thursday, in line with a broad sell-off on global exchanges. 
 In large part, investors have remained calm because the economy's underpinnings are stronger than they have been in decades. The country's fiscal management is prudent and rising oil revenues finance social programs and roads and other construction. The central bank's reserves of nearly $80 billion are higher than the country's foreign debt. 
 American and other foreign companies ignored the bitterly fought presidential campaign and continued to move work to Mexican plants. The economy is on track to create a million new jobs this year. 
 ''Foreigners looking at it from the outside say that Lopez Obrador is making a lot of noise but why should I worry?'' said Jonathan Heath, chief economist for HSBC Mexico. ''The part that is consolidated is macroeconomic stability. That's helping us not to feel the contagion effect from the politics.'' 
 Still, while Mexico may have solid economic numbers, several analysts are warning that the country can no longer afford the legislative gridlock that has bedeviled President Vicente Fox. 
 The short-term outlook ''really pales in comparison to the challenges facing Mexico in the medium term,'' said Gray Newman, Latin America economist for Morgan Stanley. 
 High oil prices and a strong American economy whose consumers buy Mexican imports now work in Mexico's favor. And yet the economy is likely to grow just 4 or 4.5 percent this year -- far too slow for a developing country where almost half the population lives in poverty. 
 ''They should be growing at a much faster rate,'' said Joydeep Mukherji, a sovereign-debt analyst at Standard & Poor's in New York. 
 Without stronger growth to create new jobs and raise wages, Mexicans will continue to migrate to the United States in search of work. 
 So, the next president will need considerable political skill to overhaul Mexico's tax, energy and labor laws, measures that economists say Mexico needs to bolster its competitiveness and assure growth in less favorable conditions. 
 Mr. Calderon has said that he believes that he will be able to form alliances in Mexico's Congress and is talking about including opposition party members in his cabinet. But because he won barely 36 percent of the vote, it is not clear how much he will be able to do. 
 Mr. Newman argued that Mexico's political class suffers from a complacency caused by what he calls the ''curse of abundance,'' which takes the pressure off passing hard reforms. 
 ''The stronger the inflows, the less progress we have on reforms,'' he said. ''The market was concerned for a while that Mexico would face some kind of crisis and asked would it withstand a negative shock. 
 ''It has learned how to withstand negative shocks,'' Mr. Newman added. ''But how do you withstand the positive shocks of workers' remittances, strong direct foreign investment, strong tourism and strong oil?'' 
 Ricardo Amorim, the head of Latin America strategy for WestLB, a German bank, said he believed that Mr. Calderon would be able to sell some kind of tax overhaul. But he was more skeptical that Congress would do much about energy legislation, which he sees as an even more urgent task. 
 ''With the lack of structural reforms, Mexico has lost its competitiveness,'' Mr. Amorim said. ''Given that, I don't think there will be much advance in terms of structural reforms. I don't think much is going to change.'' 
 Mr. Mukherji argued that many investors had missed the fact that ''Mexico's biggest political party is a conservative party.'' 
 Still, he, too, was unwilling to predict much progress. ''We should be very open-minded about what happens in 2007 onward.''

HEADLINE: In Contract Deal, Pay to Rise 10%, City Union Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration and the city's largest municipal union, District Council 37, have reached a tentative 32-month contract that gives union members raises totaling 10 percent and ends a requirement that they live in the city, union leaders said yesterday. 
 Reached late Wednesday night, the settlement is the first in a new citywide round of bargaining with dozens of unions, and it could set a pattern for future deals.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said that he wanted the city's unions to agree to money-saving productivity concessions to help finance their raises. But three union leaders involved in the negotiations -- and who insisted on anonymity because the deal is not supposed to be announced until Monday -- were adamant in saying yesterday that the union had granted no concessions to City Hall. 
 James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, said the Bloomberg administration still hoped to win concessions on health and pensions in discussions after the agreement is in effect. Mayor Bloomberg has long demanded that new employees get lower pensions than do current workers, in a bid to curtail costs. 
 The agreement, which would be retroactive to July 1, 2005, calls for a raise of 3.15 percent for the first year. It provides for a 2 percent raise this Aug. 1 for six months and then a 4 percent increase on Feb. 1. The agreement would expire on March 2, 2008. With these raises and other supplements, union officials said the deal provided a total pay increase of 10 percent.
 Since 1987, the city has required that workers in District Council 37 live in the city, a rule that has drawn increasing complaints in light of the city's fast-rising housing costs. Under the deal, the union's 120,000 members will also be allowed to live in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Putnam Counties. They will still pay the city income tax, under the agreement. 
 The union's leaders had also pushed for the right for its members to live in New Jersey as well, but that bid apparently failed, the union leaders said. 
 One outside expert saw at least one aspect of the deal as a major union victory. ''The big news is that the Bloomberg administration has abandoned its insistence that all contracts contain concessions to help pay for raises,'' said Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian at the City University Graduate Center.
 The president of one of the council's union locals said, ''The city had a budget surplus of $5 billion, and this was the first time in years that the city couldn't cry poverty.''
 The agreement calls for the city and District Council 37 to set up a subcommittee to discuss making pension changes. In addition, city officials say they hope to persuade the Municipal Labor Committee, an umbrella group of all city unions, to agree to health insurance changes, like having many employees begin paying part of their insurance premiums.
 ''We have a proven track record on these matters,'' Mr. Hanley said, noting that the city has persuaded individual unions before to join city officials in lobbying in Albany for pension changes.
 Rudy Orozco, a District Council 37 spokesman, refused to comment, except to confirm that a settlement had been reached. The deal came after 10 1/2 hours of intense negotiations on Wednesday. 
 The city has tightened and loosened residency requirements for city workers since the Depression. The original intent was to help the city's economy by limiting many municipal jobs to those who lived in the city. Some city officials also pushed for the requirement in the hope that it would slow the exodus to the suburbs and to preserve the city's tax base.
 Several labor experts said Mr. Bloomberg's decision to loosen the residency requirement was a tacit recognition that the city had become too expensive for many municipal workers. The members of District Council 37, which is part the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, make an average of $28,000 a year.
 For Mayor Bloomberg, there are considerable advantages to having reached this agreement.
 With the teachers, sanitation workers, and 18 other unions banding together to form a bargaining coalition, the city can now argue that the new settlement should set the pattern for the coalition. 
 The teachers' union is eager for raises of more than 4 percent a year to help catch up with teacher salaries in the suburbs.
 The settlement might also help tie the hands of the main police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which is seeking raises of more than 5 percent a year. The city wants a state arbitration panel to decide what the police union's contract should be. 
 City officials say the District Council 37 contract could serve as a benchmark for what any arbitration panel decides.
 Mr. Hanley had originally offered a 2 percent raise in the deal's final year, but under pressure from union negotiators, he raised that during the course of the day to 3 percent, then to 3.5 percent and then to 4 percent.
 Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said, ''We believe that the coalition gave them some leverage to up the settlement.''
 The deal would seem to be welcome news for Lillian Roberts, the executive director of District Council 37. Workers and leaders of other unions were angry that in the last contract, Ms. Roberts had agreed to a one-year wage freeze as well as other important concessions, including a lower starting salary for new workers. 
 Now Ms. Roberts, who is expected to begin a re-election campaign later this year, can boast of a contract that provides a 4 percent raise and contains no concessions.
 Charles M. Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed research and advocacy group, expressed surprise at the deal.
 ''It's a big disappointment,'' he said. ''There's no progress on the health or pensions front, which would have been important concessions. So why did they do it? I think they're trying to lock in the pattern.''
 Mr. Hanley said it was wrong to think that the city had abandoned its hopes for changes on health insurance and pensions. He said concessions on health insurance were traditionally done on a citywide basis and not through individual unions. He hopes to negotiate those changes through the Municipal Labor Committee, he said. 
 ''Health issues have only been bargained and can only be bargained with the M.L.C.,'' he said. ''There is a tacit recognition that that is where those issues will be discussed.''
 The council includes 56 locals in a variety of municipal fields, including hospital, professional, white-collar, blue-collar and clerical jobs. 
 The union agreed to extend the deal for an extra two months to get the city to agree to put $23 million into the union's deficit-plagued welfare fund.

HEADLINE: For Freshmen Headed Out of State, New York Is Top Choice

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Buoyed by declining crime and images of a dazzling lifestyle, New York State has emerged as the top destination for freshmen leaving their home states to attend college.
 ''New York has become very hot,'' said Abraham H. Lackman, a veteran of city and state government and now the president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities of New York.
Crime is less of an issue, he said. ''A second factor is, you had a number of popular TV shows that glamorized New York City: 'Seinfeld' and 'Sex and the City.' '' 
 New York's popularity as a destination for freshmen has also spread to Long Island and upstate and has been abetted by the construction of new dormitories, Mr. Lackman said. Enrollment in all the state's private colleges and universities has increased to about 460,000 from 390,000 in 1990, he said.
 But an analysis by Warren A. Brown, a demographer at Cornell's Institute for Social and Economic Research, found that upstate has been hemorrhaging people age 25 to 34. Downstate generally draws huge numbers of young adults, but begins to lose them when they reach their late 30's. 
 ''In the last decade New York has become the best state in attracting the best and the brightest,'' he said. ''The evidence is, we are failing in keeping them here.''
 Mr. Lackman and John Sexton, the president of New York University, have enlisted foundations and public officials, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, in an effort to promote higher education as a vehicle for economic development and then to develop government incentives. Plans include forging links between technology-based companies and colleges and forgiving college loans for students who remain in New York for a specified time. 
 This year, the Legislature enacted a new program that would, in effect, transform loans to college science and math majors into scholarships if the students agreed to teach in a middle school or high school in New York State for five years. 
 Upstate, where the number of factory jobs has plummeted, private universities have become among the largest employers -- the biggest in Rochester and Syracuse -- and higher education is being promoted as the cornerstone on which to build a ''knowledge economy.''
 In 1992, New York was about even with Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in attracting freshmen -- about 21,000 -- from out of state to degree-granting institutions. According to the most recent federal data, New York ranked first in 2004, with more than 36,000, ahead of Pennsylvania, California, Florida and Massachusetts. Between 1992 and 2004, New York registered the biggest increase in out-of-state freshmen of any state except Florida. 
 In 1992, after subtracting New Yorkers who attend school elsewhere, the state recorded a net loss of 3,000 students. In 2004 New York recorded a net gain of nearly 4,000 students, although it trailed Florida, which had a net gain of more than 17,000, and a number of other states. 
 While more students attend institutions of higher learning in New York than in any other city, a number of smaller cities, such as Boston, have more students per capita. 
 In a report for Mr. Lackman's commission, the Center for Governmental Research, a nonpartisan group, concluded last week: ''While acknowledged as a critical part of the state's cultural and intellectual heritage, colleges and universities have not traditionally been considered engines of the economy. That perspective has changed.''
 Dr. Sexton said his own ''aha moment'' was a conference in New York City on the eyesight of houseflies, a seemingly arcane topic that nonetheless drew several hundred scientists. 
 ''Suddenly you see something that's been there all along,'' he said. 
 Dr. Sexton said he had been approached by Singapore and Middle Eastern nations with offers to build satellite campuses for N.Y.U. 
 ''They are trying to position themselves as idea magnets,'' he said. ''If Singapore can do that, why can't you do that upstate? We'll be able to do it far more easily than the Singapores of this world.''
 With technology making jobs in finance and insurance -- which, with real estate, constitute the so-called FIRE engine of New York's downstate economy -- more fragile, attention has been generated in a largely untapped sector: intellectual, cultural and educational, which Dr. Sexton has dubbed ICE. 
 ''Our distinctive set of intellectual, cultural and educational assets,'' Dr. Sexton and Mr. Lackman wrote last year in The New York Observer, ''draw people to New York, and have the power to anchor talented workers and creative jobs.''
 The commission study found that ''private sector ICE employment grew by 16 percent from 1990 to 2005, while the rest of the economy remained stagnant.'' 
 Mr. Lackman said, ''Higher education has been the strongest component of New York's economy.'' 
 ''By the mid-1990's there was a growing awareness that the global economy was a marketplace of ideas,'' he said. ''Colleges and universities are where ideas are born and nurtured.''
 The commission study estimates that the state's private institutions of higher learning pump about $21 billion directly into the state's economy directly, more than half of that from institutions in New York City.

HEADLINE: Left Behind Economics

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
I'd like to say that there's a real dialogue taking place about the state of the U.S. economy, but the discussion leaves a lot to be desired. In general, the conversation sounds like this: 
 Bush supporter: ''Why doesn't President Bush get credit for a great economy? I blame liberal media bias.'' 
Informed economist: ''But it's not a great economy for most Americans. Many families are actually losing ground, and only a very few affluent people are doing really well.'' 
 Bush supporter: ''Why doesn't President Bush get credit for a great economy? I blame liberal media bias.'' 
 To a large extent, this dialogue of the deaf reflects Upton Sinclair's principle: it's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it. But there's also an element of genuine incredulity. Many observers, even if they acknowledge the growing concentration of income in the hands of the few, find it hard to believe that this concentration could be proceeding so rapidly as to deny most Americans any gains from economic growth. 
 Yet newly available data show that that's exactly what happened in 2004. 
 Why talk about 2004, rather than more recent experience? Unfortunately, data on the distribution of income arrive with a substantial lag; the full story of what happened in 2004 has only just become available, and we won't be able to tell the full story of what's happening right now until the last year of the Bush administration. But it's reasonably clear that what's happening now is the same as what happened then: growth in the economy as a whole is mainly benefiting a small elite, while bypassing most families. 
 Here's what happened in 2004. The U.S. economy grew 4.2 percent, a very good number. Yet last August the Census Bureau reported that real median family income -- the purchasing power of the typical family -- actually fell. Meanwhile, poverty increased, as did the number of Americans without health insurance. So where did the growth go? 
 The answer comes from the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, whose long-term estimates of income equality have become the gold standard for research on this topic, and who have recently updated their estimates to include 2004. They show that even if you exclude capital gains from a rising stock market, in 2004 the real income of the richest 1 percent of Americans surged by almost 12.5 percent. Meanwhile, the average real income of the bottom 99 percent of the population rose only 1.5 percent. In other words, a relative handful of people received most of the benefits of growth. 
 There are a couple of additional revelations in the 2004 data. One is that growth didn't just bypass the poor and the lower middle class, it bypassed the upper middle class too. Even people at the 95th percentile of the income distribution -- that is, people richer than 19 out of 20 Americans -- gained only modestly. The big increases went only to people who were already in the economic stratosphere. 
 The other revelation is that being highly educated was no guarantee of sharing in the benefits of economic growth. There's a persistent myth, perpetuated by economists who should know better -- like Edward Lazear, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers -- that rising inequality in the United States is mainly a matter of a rising gap between those with a lot of education and those without. But census data show that the real earnings of the typical college graduate actually fell in 2004. 
 In short, it's a great economy if you're a high-level corporate executive or someone who owns a lot of stock. For most other Americans, economic growth is a spectator sport. 
 Can anything be done to spread the benefits of a growing economy more widely? Of course. A good start would be to increase the minimum wage, which in real terms is at its lowest level in half a century. 
 But don't expect this administration or this Congress to do anything to limit the growing concentration of income. Sometimes I even feel sorry for these people and their apologists, who are prevented from acknowledging that inequality is a problem by both their political philosophy and their dependence on financial support from the wealthy. That leaves them no choice but to keep insisting that ordinary Americans -- who have, in fact, been bypassed by economic growth -- just don't understand how well they're doing.

HEADLINE: Bush Gives Qualified Support for Israel's Strikes

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: STRALSUND, Germany, July 13 

 BODY:
President Bush gave qualified support on Thursday for Israel's strikes on Lebanon, telling reporters gathered here for his visit with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, ''Israel has a right to defend herself.''
 Mr. Bush placed the blame for the tensions squarely on Syria for housing leaders of Hezbollah.
Even as he cautioned Israel to be careful not to destabilize the young democracy in Lebanon, Mr. Bush's position immediately put him at odds with European nations just before the annual summit meeting of the Group of 8 economic powers. 
 The European Union and the French government each released statements calling Israel's naval blockade of Lebanon and its shelling of the Beirut airport a ''disproportionate use of force'' in retaliation for Hezbollah's shelling of Israel across the Lebanon border. 
 The shelling was apparently a diversionary tactic that was followed by the capture of two Israeli soldiers and the killing of eight others.
 ''The imposition of an air and sea blockade on Lebanon cannot be justified,'' the European Union said in a statement.
 ''The concern,'' Mr. Bush said, ''is that any activities by Israel to protect herself will weaken that government. Having said all that, people need to protect themselves. There are terrorists who will blow up innocent people in order to achieve tactical objectives.'' 
 Mr. Bush had called the Hezbollah actions ''pathetic.''
 An official familiar with talks between the United States and Israel said the Americans had emphasized to Israel the importance of avoiding any refugee crisis. 
 The official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations, said the Americans had also asked Israel to be careful not to destroy governmental organizations or to press Prime Minister Fouad Siniora to enter the situation.
 Mr. Bush made his comments after a ceremony with Mrs. Merkel where he was presented with a traditional local gift in the town square here, a barrel of herring, and hours before he was scheduled to go to a barbeque with a freshly slaughtered wild boar served in his honor.
 In his question-and-answer session with reporters, Mr. Bush joked about that dinner, kidding in response to a double-barreled question on the growing crisis and Iran's nuclear ambitions. 
 ''I thought you were going to ask me about the pig,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Hours later in nearby Heiligendamm, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, briefed reporters to re-emphasize the message that Israel should show some restraint and avoid civilian casualties or steps that could destabilize Mr. Siniora's democratically elected government, which includes Hezbollah members. 
 ''It is extremely important that Israel exercise her restraint in its activities of self-defense,'' Ms. Rice said.
 Speaking to reporters, she pointed to a way out of the crisis through the return of the abducted soldiers.
 The administration has hostile relations with the two nations perceived to have the most influence on Hezbollah, Syria and Iran. Ms. Rice singled them out for ''encouraging and, indeed in the case of Syria, sheltering the very people who are perpetrating these acts.''
 That has left the administration to rely on other diplomatic efforts in the region to help find a solution, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. But none of those has great influence over the Hezbollah leadership.
 The United States could also find help from Germany. Mrs. Merkel on Thursday took a similar, if more measured line, as Mr. Bush. 
 ''The parties to that conflict obviously have to use proportionate means,'' she said. ''But I am not at all for sort of blurring the lines between the root causes and the consequences of an action. There has to be a good reaction now, not from the Israeli government, but from those who started these attacks in the first place.''
 Mr. Hadley said Mr. Bush would most likely take a larger role, and Ms. Rice said he would certainly discuss the situation at the Group of 8 meeting in St. Petersburg.
 Ms. Rice and Mr. Hadley also said they were placing hope in the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, who said he was dispatching Terje Roed-Larsen and Alvaro de Soto, Middle East advisers, and Mr. Annan's special political adviser, Vijay Nambiar, to the region to urge restraint on all sides.
 The three diplomats plan to visit Cairo first to see Egyptian leaders and Arab League foreign ministers meeting there on Saturday. They are then expected to go to Israel, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Syria and other destinations ''as needed,'' a statement said.
 The Lebanon topic is scheduled to occupy the Security Council on Friday after Beirut requested an emergency meeting. The Lebanese mission to the United Nations called on the Council to issue a ''firm, comprehensive and immediate resolution to establish a cease-fire and to lift the siege on Lebanon.''

U.S. Vetoes Criticism of Israel
(By The New York Times)
 UNITED NATIONS, July 13 -- The United States used its veto power on Thursday to block a Security Council resolution that would accuse Israel of a ''disproportionate use of force.''
 John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, exercised the veto after failing in an effort to deny the resolution the nine votes needed for adoption.
 The resolution drew 10 votes on the 15-member panel, with Britain, Denmark, Peru and Slovakia abstaining. The measure, drafted by Qatar, the Arab representative on the Council, demanded that Israel halt military operations, release Palestinian prisoners, restore fuel supplies and replace destroyed power plant equipment.
 In an effort to achieve balance, language was added condemning the abduction of an Israeli soldier and the firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel. Mr. Bolton said the resolution still ''placed demands on one side in the Middle East conflict but not on the other.''

HEADLINE: As Summit Opens, Russia Counts Its Gains and Slights

BYLINE: Compiled by MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.

TODAYS TOP STORIES
 Moscow will empty this weekend as politicians, bureaucrats and journalists head for St. Petersburg and the Group of Eight summit. The major Russian newspapers today glance over the already-well-known substance of the proceedings, choosing to highlight Russias unique place in the summit and speculate on potential intrigue.
The events were to begin unofficially this evening with an informal meeting between President Bush and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. Kommersant reports that the Kremlin proposed the idea of a private, pre-summit meeting as a way to discuss contentious issuesmost notably democracy and frozen conflicts in Transnistria and Georgiawhich could potentially embarrass Moscow during its official meetings with G8 leaders. 
 Last week, the newspaper says, Mr. Bush promised not to give Putin a lecture on democracy, but did not make guarantees that the subject would not arise. To the consternation of Mr. Putin, Washington ignored warnings by a presidential aid, Igor Shuvalov, not to send representatives to the Other Russia conference held earlier this week. President Bush also met earlier with representatives of Russian civic organizations, including Irina Yasina, head of Mikhail Khordokovskys Open Russian Foundation. A further slight came in the form of an announcement American officials plan to submit to G8 leaders on the dangers of corruption to democratic development. The United States also surprised Russian officials by announcing that it would submit a statement in support of peacekeeping operations, which Moscow often interprets as Washingtons attempts to encroach on its sphere of influence. 
 According to Gazeta, however, Russia is not coming to the G8 summit empty handed. On terrorism, one of the most important issues of the day, Moscow can tout its recent victory over the Bin Laden of the Caucasus, the Chechen rebel Shamil Basayev, whom Russian special forces troops, according to official pronouncements, killed in Ingushetia. 
 Along with this victory over terrorism comes the defeat of inflation. Prices have stopped rising, says Gazeta, and inflation has frozen at about 7 to 8 percent. There is no need to spoil this victory, the newspaper says, by noting that the decline was coincidental. 
 Gazeta also points out that the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, a major figure in the upcoming summit, has already achieved all that it wanted and more. Russia is now left to press its main task of becoming a leader in world energy supply and production, while the west is looking to avoid dependence on Gazprom and Rosneft. 
 Russia can count as a further victory, Izvestia says, the fact that the summit is being held at all. It says that up to the last minute, opponents of Russias G8 chairmanship have been attempting to sabotage this weekends summit. A wave of criticism disparaging Russia as unworthy increased ten-fold in the run-up to the event. The one thing these challengers of a strong Russia have achieved is the strengthening of Kremlin arguments for the assertion of its righteousness internal and external politics, the paper says. In the words of one high placed Moscow official, the Kremlin and its critics are completely different. We are better and we now know that. 
 Izvestia continues, saying that one of Russias main tasks at the summit is to show that Russia is open to the world. This is why, the newspaper contends, Moscow has seen a proliferation of mini-summits: meetings with religious leaders and workers union representatives, ministers of foreign affairs, prosecutors and nongovernmental organizations. In each of these meetings, Mr. Putin took recommendations and listened to criticism, which he has used in the preparations for the summit, the paper said. 

IN OTHER NEWS

KOMMERSANT

THERE IS NO OTHER RUSSIA ON STATE TV: None of the major, state-run television networks broadcasted coverage of the Other Russia conference held in Moscow this week. We have very strong competition between broadcast materials, explained Channel One Deputy General Director, Kirill Kleimenov. We have more topical, rich and interesting subjects than the Other Russia forum. Journalists from NTV said that the stations general director ordered a boycott of the conference. The editor of the news channel Vesti 24, Dmitri Mednikov, was quoted as saying we dont think the forum...is an important enough political event to justify in depth coverage.

CIVILIAN DOCTOR GIVES THE ARMY HIS DIAGNOSIS: Renat Talipov, a surgeon at the Chelyabinsk city hospital, gave testimony at the trial of Sgt. Aleksandr Sibyakov, accused of harassing Pvt. Andre Sychev, who had his legs and genitals amputated as a result of hazing in his army unit. Mr. Talipov testified that Private Sychevs condition was diagnosed as a dry gangrene infection resulting from positioned compression. This is contrary to the military doctors diagnosis of a blood vessel irritation. The military doctor likewise failed to notice the three to four millimeter fractures in the Privates femur bone, Mr. Talipov said. Mr. Talipovs testimony is a victory for the prosecution after having to dismiss nine witnesses from Private Sychevs unit in Chelyabinsk. The nine soldiers refused to testify against the defendant because they claim the military pressured them not to. According to Kommersant, the Ministry of Defense claims there were no beatings and the amputations were a result of a previous illness. Private Sychevs mother claims she was offered money to withhold evidence that her son was beaten.

TRANSNISTRIAS FUTURE IN QUESTION: Transnistria, a separatist region of Moldova, will hold a referendum on Sept. 17 to decide on possible unification with the Russian Federation. The leader of the region, Igor Smirnov, informed deputies in the supreme council that the authorities have held initial discussions on the question of a plebiscite with officials from Moscow. Experts argue, however, that Transnistrias future depends more on the situation in Ukraine than on a referendum. A member of the Ukrainian parliament, Taras Chernovil, said that as soon as his Party of Regions normalizes the political situation in Ukraine, it will push for a repeal of the Ukrainian blockade of Transnistria.

INDUSTRIALIST URGES ENERGY COOPERATION: In an article published today, Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire industrialist and president of Renova, speaks out about Russias role in energy security ahead of the Group of 8 Summit. Russias leading role in supplying energy resources to the global market is undeniable, he writes. Russia and Europe are natural partners and issues arising from agreements with China should not worry European leaders. He encourages agreements not just between corporations, but also between governments on issues of energy security. Increasing state control over its energy resources is a natural process, one that needs to avoid creating monopolistic positions in the market. He concludes by calling for cooperation of participants on all levels both in individual projects and international agreements.

PROTECTION PROMISED FOR SOUTH OSSETIA: Russia will not allow harm to come not only to its peacekeepers located in South Ossetia, but also to the local population, the Minister of Defense, Sergei B. Ivanov, told reporters Thursday. During a visit to the 20th infantry division based in Volgograd, he reminded reporters that 90 percent of South Ossetians are citizens of Russia. These remarks come during a period of tension over Russian peacekeepers in the separatist region of Georgia and allegations by the Georgian government of Russian interventionism in what they consider an internal affair. Mr. Ivanovs assertions are of interest in light of todays bomb attack in Tskhinvali, capital of the breakaway province of South Ossetia, and renewed calls by Georgia for Russia to remove their peacekeepers from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

HEADLINE: Bush Begins Advanced Course on the Ways of Putin

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and JIM RUTENBERG; Thom Shanker reported from Washington for this article, and Jim Rutenberg from Rostock, Germany.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
Shortly before Christmas, the White House received some strange and decidedly awkward news out of Moscow.
 A Russian oil company was courting one of President Bush's closest friends, former Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, to be its chairman. Even more surprising was that President Vladimir V. Putin personally delivered the job offer.
Mr. Bush was described as bemused, while other White House officials were disturbed. The offer, coming just as the administration was growing increasingly outspoken over Mr. Putin's consolidation of state power and his penchant for using energy supplies as a tool of international politics, seemed a clumsy effort to win White House favor. A senior administration official said Mr. Putin told Mr. Bush in advance about the offer, which was turned down.
 ''I think you could interpret him making that offer to Don Evans as a sign of disrespect in a way -- 'I can buy off your best friend,' '' said Andrew C. Kuchins, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But, Mr. Kuchins said, it also was ''reflective of Putin, in his own odd way, reaching out and sending a positive signal, and as so often happens with the Russians, they send their signals in odd, very heavy-handed ways.'' 
 A senior administration official familiar with the details of the Evans talks said Thursday: ''It's not that we didn't take it well -- I think Putin was well-intentioned. He wanted a credible businessman from the West that could credential the company -- kind of a shortcut for the real reforms they needed to embark upon.''
 It was one of many lessons in the continuing education of Mr. Bush in the ways of Mr. Putin, and through him, the ways of modern Russia.
 That education will be put to the test this weekend. On Friday, Mr. Bush arrives in St. Petersburg to meet his Russian counterpart again, but this time he is holding to a warier view of Mr. Putin, a former KGB boss who is freshly assertive on the global stage.
 Mr. Bush is expected to tell Mr. Putin that he wants to see Russia succeed, yet also believes that its best interests can be secured only by pressing forward with democratic reforms. The message includes a pledge of rewards, including deeper integration into the world community, with Washington's backing.
 The two presidents face a daunting agenda, seeking agreement on the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran, on the Middle East conflict and on energy and free trade.
 As President Putin plays host to leaders of the Group of 8 economic powers in the city founded by Peter the Great to be Russia's ''window on the West,'' relations between Moscow and Washington have turned frosty.
 Presidents Bush and Putin met for the first time five years ago in Slovenia. Mr. Bush embraced the Russian leader with a startling statement of support, even empathy.
 ''I looked the man in the eye,'' Mr. Bush said, and ''I was able to get a sense of his soul.'' 
 But as Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, put it, ''It's always a risky business to put yourself in the position of validating the soulful qualities of a former KGB agent.''
 While some officials around Mr. Bush now say the statement is ''much regretted,'' other advisers called it a realistic assessment that Mr. Putin was a Russian patriot who could be expected to look after Russian interests. Regardless of whether he was a man America could do business with, White House advisers said, Mr. Bush realized he was a man America had to do business with.
 While that remains the president's goal, administration policies have hardened as Mr. Putin has continued to consolidate state power in a single political institution -- the presidency -- to the exclusion of an independent judiciary, legislature and press. And just beyond Russia's borders, he continues to intimidate democratic states that have voted themselves away from Moscow's dominance.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a Russian expert by training who has been influential in shaping administration policy, and the president's own thinking, on the country since the 2000 presidential campaign, said it was a reality of great power relations that ''it's not linear.''
 ''It always has elements of good and elements of difficulty, because they are big, complex relationships,'' Ms. Rice said. ''Russia has its own interests. And Russia is going to pursue those interests.''
 She said Mr. Bush ''has had a view going back to the time of the campaign that there were a few relationships that would be important to the ability to get things done in the world, and Russia is clearly one of those relationships.''
 The Bush administration still clings unwaveringly to ''the principal view, the principal goal, that Russia and the United States can be partners,'' Ms. Rice said. But any deepening of that partnership, she cautioned, will require that ''Russia's internal transition move in a more democratic direction.''
 In recent months, American policy has taken a harder line toward Russia, exemplified when Vice President Dick Cheney traveled to the former Soviet republic of Lithuania in May to criticize Moscow's lack of commitment to democracy.
 The response has been icy, and centered on accusations that the Bush administration operates a double standard, subordinating its advocacy for global democracy whenever required in the battle against terrorists or the drive for energy security.
 Russian officials ask how the United States dares criticize Mr. Putin as it cozies up to other leaders in the region who sit atop geopolitical crossroads or oil supplies but receive unfavorable reviews from election monitors and human right groups.
 ''Within the administration, it looks like this newly self-confident Russia, with it oil revenues, is acting in ways that are against U.S. interests,'' said Angela E. Stent, who served as the national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the National Intelligence Council. ''A selective partnership is still the best way to describe the U.S.-Russian relationship.''
 Aides say the personal ties between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin may pull their nations back toward friendlier ground. Mr. Bush occasionally tells a story about his relationship with Mr. Putin, illustrating their bonhomie and the underlying rivalry.
 When Mr. Bush visited the Russian president's dacha outside Moscow, Mr. Putin's Labrador bounded out to greet them. Comparing his dog to Mr. Bush's smaller Scottish terrier, Mr. Putin turned to Mr. Bush and said, ''Bigger, tougher, stronger, faster, meaner -- than Barney,'' Mr. Bush's dog. Mr. Bush's aides say they take the tale as a mark of a friendship strengthened by a little needling. But Russian policy analysts said they heard a different message in the story when Mr. Putin told it to them. The teasing also conveys a sense of self-confidence married to self-doubt that dates to czarist times.
 Ms. Rice emphasizes that Mr. Bush takes the view that Russia is a political investment that requires patience. The effort to integrate Russia into Western institutions, she added, '' is going to be an enormous win for international peace and security.''
 ''As the president once said not too long ago, 'I'm not going to give up on Russia,' '' Ms. Rice recalled. 

Belarus Sentences Oppositionist
(By The New York Times)
 MOSCOW, July 13 -- An opposition candidate who ran against President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus in an election in March was sentenced to five and half years in prison on Thursday for hooliganism and causing a public disturbance. 
 The man, Aleksandr V. Kazulin, was arrested on March 25 as he led a protest against the rigged election.

HEADLINE: Study Cites Plan to End U.S. Oil Imports

BYLINE: By MATT WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
American imports of oil could be eliminated by 2030, a new study by an interstate consortium asserts, if the nation turns to an aggressive program of energy efficiency and commercialization of four already-demonstrated technologies for making transportation fuels.
 The study, sponsored by a nonprofit group of legislators and governors called the Southern States Energy Board, urges a crash program to meet fuel needs without imports, a strategy it says will lead to an American ''industrial rebirth.'' It says that such a strategy could create more than one million new jobs, reduce the trade deficit by more than $600 billion, and end oil price shocks that hurt the economy. 
Roger Bezdek, an author of the report, to be released Monday, said that the volatility in fuel prices is driven by the narrow dependence on a limited number of big oil-producing countries as practically the sole source of energy for transportation. ''Right now,'' he said, ''if a couple of oil workers get kidnapped in Nigeria, the price goes up $5 a barrel.''
 But for the strategy to work, the study said, an expansive investment of private funds would be required, with encouragement from ''appropriate fiscal, regulatory, and institutional support mechanisms'' for 20 years. 
 The study also suggested that the current push to produce ethanol from corn as a fuel supplement is largely misplaced. 
 The four technologies for producing the fuels are profitable when the price of the oil they replace is $35 to $55 a barrel, the study said.
 Three are closely related. The one with the biggest potential -- estimated to displace 29 percent of imported oil -- is making liquid fuels from coal, using the Fischer-Tropsch method. 
 A second is to take the carbon dioxide created in both that process and other processes and pump it into old oil fields to push more oil to the surface, a technique called enhanced oil recovery.
 A third is to use biomass, including wood and crop wastes, as feedstock for factories that make a fuel gas consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. That so-called synthesis gas is the same as that made from coal in the Fischer-Tropsch method and it can then be turned into a liquid.
 The fourth is production of oil from shale, a technique tried after the oil shock of 1979, but abandoned when prices fell. 
 An energy expert not connected to the study, Jason S. Grumet, executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy, said that the goal of saving or displacing the amount of oil contemplated in the study was probably possible over the time period, although he said the challenge was ''herculean.'' 
 But Mr. Grumet, who is the executive director of the National Energy Commission -- a private group that produced a study on electricity, transportation fuel, climate change and security -- warned that such a program still would not eliminate oil imports, because oil from abroad would be less expensive than oil from domestic sources.
 Every barrel saved or replaced would still be a big benefit to security and the economy, he said.
 To some extent, the study is a platform for the states to call for a national push to use the resources found within their own borders. Several of the member states have significant coal mining operations and old oil fields that could be brought back into production with carbon dioxide flooding. And all produce biomass. But the raw materials for this approach are also present in much of the rest of the United States.
 While the study does not put much support behind using corn to make ethanol, it does anticipate the production of ethanol from cellulose -- the woody part of plants -- in a process that has been demonstrated but not made commercially.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales, Expected to Rise, Instead Fell in June

BYLINE: Dow Jones

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
Retail sales fell in June by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said Friday, the first decline in four months.
 The decline surprised economists, who had forecast an increase of 0.4 percent, and could influence Federal Reserve policy makers as they consider interest rates at their monthly meeting in August. 
''Three-dollar gas really hits home,'' said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''It seems gasoline expenditures are putting bigger pressure on household budgets.''
 In another report, the Labor Department said the cost of imported products rose 0.1 percent in June, held down by a decline in the price of crude oil.
 Petroleum import prices dropped by 1.4 percent in June after climbing 6.1 percent in May and 11 percent in April; they are up 32.6 percent so far this year. 
 Excluding petroleum, import prices were 0.4 percent higher in June, after rising 0.7 percent in May. The increases could cause concern for Federal Reserve policy makers, who have raised interest rates 17 consecutive times at their monthly policy meetings. 
 The outcome of their next policy meeting, on Aug. 8, is seen as much less certain than previous sessions. Some economists expect a pause in tightening because of the economy's slowdown. 
 ''This retail sales number does suggest the economy is losing some of its momentum,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist for J. P. Morgan Private Client Services in New York.
 ''The effects of rising energy prices are starting to gain some traction on the consumer spending front, and, certainly, the effects of rising mortgage rates are starting to impact spending,'' Mr. Chan said.
 Another indicator on the economy released Friday, the University of Michigan's report on consumer sentiment for mid-July, also showed a decline. The index slipped to 83.0 from 84.9 in June.
 The retail sales data showed demand for autos and parts decreased by 1.4 percent in June after falling by 2.1 percent in May. Outside the car sector, all other retail sales climbed 0.3 percent, below the 0.4 percent increase expected by economists.
 Mail order and Internet sales were lower.
 ''The underlying fundamentals supporting consumption spending are still very positive: respectable employment growth, coupled with private-sector wage and salary gains running at close to 3 percent,'' said Brian Bethune, an economist at Global Insight. 
 A Commerce Department report showed business inventories increased 8 percent in May, twice the rate that was expected.

HEADLINE: Economists Applaud Japan's Rate Increase 

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 14 

 BODY:
Economists applauded the Bank of Japan's interest rate increase, the first in six years, as a long-awaited signal that Japan's $4.6 trillion economy is finally getting back on track. 
 They said that by moving pre-emptively on Friday, long before a return of inflation is likely to became a threat, the central bank was also hoping to demonstrate that it was watching prices carefully, and was therefore up to the task of stewarding Japan's economy, the world's second largest after the United States.
The Bank of Japan edged up its target overnight rate to 0.25 percent from effectively zero, where it had sat for most of the last seven years. 
 Economists said the bank's main concern in raising rates was restoring its own reputation after a series of policy mistakes that deepened Japan's economic troubles during more than a decade of stagnation.
 The biggest error came during twin real estate and stock market bubbles in the late 1980's, when the bank was slow to react and then overcompensated by raising rates too drastically. In 2000, the bank raised rates just as the Internet bubble was starting to collapse, and had to reverse itself a few months later as the economy wilted.
 These errors have haunted the bank as it tries to win respect on a par with the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. 
 Economists, however, did say the bank deserved praise for continuing to function normally despite an investment scandal involving its governor, Toshihiko Fukui, who has faced calls to resign since admitting last month that he owned shares in a stock fund run by an investor later indicted for insider trading. 
 Many feared the scandal could paralyze policy making, or worse make the bank less able to resist rising political pressure against a rate increase by those who feared an increase could destroy jobs.
 ''The actual impact on markets from the Bank of Japan's rate hike is extremely small,'' said Takahide Kiuchi, senior economist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. ''But the psychological impact of this step is tremendous.''
 But while the rate increase was well received in Japan, there was concern the bank had turned a blind eye to its consequences for global financial markets. Traders and investors said the increase, coming as the United States and Europe are also raising rates, added to the perception that the world was entering a phase of monetary tightening. 
 Some said this could be the wrong message at the wrong time, coming as rising tensions over Iran's nuclear program and missile tests by North Korea threaten global growth. 
 ''With the geo-political issues, this could be a bad time to be tightening,'' said Stefan Worrall, an equity broker in the Tokyo office of Credit Suisse First Boston.
 Other fallout from the move could also include a slowing of the so-called carry trade, an often lucrative maneuver by hedge funds and other large investors who borrow money in Japan at low rates to invest in emerging markets for higher returns.
 At home in Japan, the move may also indirectly hurt profits at exporters like Sony and Toyota, as higher interest rates make Japan a more attractive place to invest, driving up the yen -- and thus the price of Japanese products overseas.
 At the same time, Mr. Fukui was careful to address concerns that the bank might start raising rates too quickly, and choke off the recovery. At a news conference on Friday, he said that the bank ''does not intend to carry out consecutive rate hikes.''
 ''Today, we took a first but important step in the process of normalizing interest rate levels,'' he said. ''We made this decision not to address a clear and present inflation risk, but to contribute to a sustained economic recovery by taking a more forward-looking stance.''
 While some economists worried an increase might be premature, others said they expected higher rates to actually give the economy a lift, particularly as interest on bank accounts begins to rise from near zero for the first time since the late 1990's. Mr. Kiuchi at Nomura calculates that an increase of 0.25 percentage points in rates of return on bank accounts and other investments would put an additional 1 trillion yen (about $9 billion) into the pockets of consumers. He said much of that would find its way back into the economy as fresh spending. 
 Economists also called Friday's move a major step in achieving what Mr. Fukui has said he hopes will be his chief legacy: a smooth exit from the super-loose policies that he inherited when he took the bank's helm three years ago. These emergency measures, which included zero interest rates, were adopted in the 1990's to reflate the economy. But when Japan's recovery began for real about two years ago, debate shifted to how the bank should return to normal interest rates without disrupting growth or roiling markets.
 Mr. Fukui took the first step in March, when he began draining cash that had been pumped into the banking system to avert a financial collapse. Friday's move was his first attempt at restoring interest rates to healthy levels above zero. 
 ''This is a signal that Japan is back,'' said Jason Rogers, an analyst specializing in Asian banking and central bank policy in the Singapore office of Barclays. ''Once rates start going up, Japan stops looking so abnormal.''
 The reaction in financial markets was mild, partly because the increase was so incremental, and still far below the equivalent rate of 5.25 percent in the United States. The increase had also been widely expected amid recent data showing strong growth and a rebound in prices after years of corrosive deflationary declines.
 Still, economists said it was significant that the bank had acted at all. Just a few months ago, economists had been predicting that the bank's traditional caution would prevent it from raising rates until year's end, at earliest. Now, the bank is at least trying to appear more decisive, a shift that could help restore confidence in an institution that has been widely criticized for doing too little to end Japan's decade of stagnation.

HEADLINE: Keep Eyes Fixed on Variable Mortgages

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
The raising of interest rates on millions of adjustable rate mortgages over the next several years has all the makings of a classic horror story. 
 As home prices appreciated from ridiculously high to unbelievably higher, more Americans began using mortgages that allowed them to buy more house for less of a monthly payment. Next year, a large portion of those rates move up and homeowners who opted for the exotic mortgages could find their payments doubled. Talk about bloody. They need to find a way to minimize the pain.
 Many will refinance their loans. But for others, whose mortgages now exceed the value of their homes or whose debt payments exceed 40 percent of their incomes, there may be no other solution than to get out of their houses. With the housing market cooling, selling it may not be easy. Some may default on their loans.
 With more homes on the market, prices could begin to fall. That reduces home equity -- the difference between the amount borrowed and the total value of the home -- and could force people whose loans change in 2008 and 2009 to consider selling, further accelerating the drop in prices. Some of those cities with the highest proportions of interest-only loans are also at the greatest risk of falling prices. 
 Mortgage lenders, however, say they are not worried. Economists say even the worst-case outcome will not have much impact on the overall national economy. Christopher L. Cagan, director of research and analytics at First American Real Estate Solutions, points out that mortgage industry losses of $110 billion spread over several years would amount to a mere 1 percent of the total national homeowners' equity of $11 trillion and a hiccup in the gross domestic product
 On a personal level, however, there is going to be pain as homeowners struggle to make higher payments. In 2003, of all new mortgages, 10.2 percent were interest-only, meaning the homeowner paid only the interest for the initial period of the loan. According to Loan Performance, a research firm, 26.7 percent of all loans were interest-only last year and another 15.3 percent were payment-option adjustable rate mortgages, which allow homeowners to choose how much they paid each month. 
 In some areas of the country where homes are expensive, these loans were highly popular. In most California cities, as well as in Denver, Washington, Phoenix and Seattle, interest-only loans represented 40 percent or more of all mortgages issued in 2005. 
 Traditionally, interest-only loans and adjustable-rate loans were used by people who expected to live in a house only a short time, but such loans have turned into ''affordability products'' as housing prices rose. The interest rate on the loans, while below that of conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at the beginning, resets after 3, 5, 7 or 10 years, depending on the loan. So, homeowners who took out loans in 2004 could find, for example, that their initial 4.25 percent loan climbs to 6.25 percent or 7.25 percent next year. 
 Someone now paying $350 a month for a $100,000 interest-only loan could be facing payments of $680 both because of the shift to the higher rate and because the borrower would have to start paying off the principal as well as the interest. 
 ''You need a couple of good pay raises in order to afford it,'' said Mark Fleming, chief economist with CoreLogic, which develops risk models for the mortgage lenders. ''It's pretty hard to deal with a payment shock of 80 percent or 90 percent,'' he said. 
 The mortgage industry is not worried about payment shock. Why?
 ''It offers an opportunity,'' said Brad Brunts, managing director of portfolio management at Citi Mortgage, a unit of Citigroup.
 He, like others in the mortgage industry, sees the higher payments as a boost to the flagging mortgage refinancing business. Lenders will adjust about $500 billion in mortgages this year and $700 billion next year, according to Freddie Mac, the quasi-government agency that repackages mortgages for investors. Expect to find the mailbox stuffed with refinancing offers. 
 Mr. Brunts said only a minority of mortgage holders will face real problems. Most will successfully refinance and though they will pay more, he thinks they will be able to make the payments. 
 Anyone with a rate that will increase in the next few years, however, ought to worry. If homeowners have an adjustable-rate mortgage, they can hope or pray that there is a recession severe enough for the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates. But they would also have to hope or pray that the recession was not so severe that they lost their jobs. 
 Hoping or praying is not a useful financial strategy, if only because most economists think that rates will climb a bit more and then stay steady through 2007. No one can say with any certainty whether rates will rise or fall in 2008 or 2009. 
 Here is more practical advice. First, homeowners should take a look at their loan documents to determine when it changes and by how much. In most cases, the rate cannot go up more than two or three percentage points a year. 
 That is still a lot. The next thing for an owner to do is take a deep breath and figure out what the monthly payments will be when the rate moves. Any number of mortgage payment calculators on the Web can help. Hard as this may be to face, homeowners should not ignore it. Those who get behind on payments can ruin their credit ratings and then it will be even more difficult to refinance the loan at a reasonable rate. 
 ''It all depends on the ability to refinance before the interest rate resets,'' said Suzanne Mistretta, senior director of Fitch Residential Mortgage, which analyzes credit risk of mortgages. ''Most of them will get out. Hopefully, they will get out,'' she said. ''That is the big question.'' 
 Mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are still low nationwide and in the coastal states where prices appreciated the most. In the last year, the highest portions of homeowners who fell behind in payments were found in regions where homes were least expensive like the South and the Rust Belt states. But lenders expect the numbers will go up across the country even if they never hit crisis levels.
 In most cases, homeowners will probably want to refinance the loan because the rate on a new loan will be lower than the reset rate. The best option may be a fixed-rate mortgage. In contrast to three years ago, the difference between interest rates on fixed-rate and adjustable mortgages has shrunk. 
 Rates vary by the amount borrowed and where the house is, but a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was averaging 6.74 percent this week, while an adjustable-rate loan that will not change for another five years was 6.33 percent. The initial, or ''teaser'' rate for a new five-year interest-only loan was advertised as 5.5 percent to 7 percent.
 Lenders never cease to be creative. They keep coming up with new flavors of loans: 40-year fixed-rate loans that offer lower payments, but that cost more over the long run, or 30-year interest-only loans in which only interest is paid for the first 10 years. The only way to know which one to choose is to make the lender calculate the payments for every option. 
 Homeowners should start exploring the refinancing options about six months before a loan changes. Lenders say there is little reason to do it earlier. Payments are lower with the interest-only loan and, presumably, those holding the loans are saving the difference. At this point, if rates stay about the same or do not go much higher, there is little advantage to acting too far in advance because the payments will just go up sooner rather than later. (But homeowners should spend less elsewhere right now. They may as well get used to the drill; they will need the savings to cover the future higher payments.) 
 Sometimes, though, homeowners may have to take more drastic steps. The lender may not be interested in refinancing a home loan when the value of the home is below the loan amount. That could happen because a homeowner took out all the equity in a previous refinancing. (Freddie Mac estimates that Americans took $556 billion out of their homes through cash-out refinancings and home equity loans since 2004.) 
 It could happen if the price of the house has fallen or if the owner has been making only the minimum payment on a payment-option loan so that the loan balance has actually grown. (It is what the industry calls a negative-amortization loan). The best option then is probably to sell the house and scale back. Homeowners may also want to sell if they can clearly see that there is no way they can make the higher, refinanced payment.
 In that case, it is better to act now before a few million other interest-only mortgage holders dump their homes on the market.

HEADLINE: A Bad Week Gets Worse For Markets

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Stocks deepened their losses for the week yesterday and oil prices inched closer to $80 a barrel as the worsening conflict in the Middle East hung uneasily over commodities and equities markets.
 Yesterday was Day 3 of a losing streak for American stocks, which were also pummeled by some discouraging reports about consumer's spending and confidence that gave investors yet another reason to drive prices lower.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed yesterday just 12.5 points away from its yearly low, declining 0.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average had its third consecutive day of losses exceeding 100 points, closing down 1 percent. The Nasdaq also fell about 1 percent. 
 For the week, the losses were heavier: 2.3 percent for the S.& P., 3.2 percent for the Dow and 4.4 percent for the Nasdaq.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil prices broke past the record of $76.70 a barrel set just Thursday. The new price of oil for delivery in August shot to $77.95 before finishing the day at $77.03.
 While $80-a-barrel oil seemed like a skeptic's worst-case outlook a few months ago, oil traders are increasingly saying that it is now just a matter of time before prices cross that threshold. Oil futures contracts for delivery beyond this summer passed $80 a barrel for the first time on Thursday. 
 ''The feeling is that we're in a fairly bullish market right now,'' said Antoine Halff, head of research at Fimat. ''Gas demand over the last few weeks has been very robust. Perhaps the bigger issue on top of that is geopolitics. And clearly the market is very jittery about what's going on in Israel.''
 Oil markets are typically sensitive to any political instability in the Middle East. Recently, they have been unsettled by Israeli military incursions into Gaza and then, this week, Lebanon. So, a market already worried about the potential for conflict with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs is growing even more anxious.
 William Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics, said, ''People are scared, that's the bottom line.'' 
 Analysts said that in such a tense environment, events that typically would be overlooked are scrutinized, resulting in the type of market reaction seen after reports yesterday came out indicating surprisingly weak retail sales and lower consumer confidence.
 The Commerce Department said that retail sales fell by 0.1 percent in June, seasonally adjusted, the first drop since February. Taken with a University of Michigan survey that showed falling consumer confidence, the reports were seen as signs that consumers were growing weary.
 ''In another week, those reports would not have been as destructive to the market,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.
 How resilient consumer spending proves to be is something that will continue to factor heavily into stock performance. Most economists believe that consumers will curb their spending somewhat as the year goes on, and economic growth is expected to slow. But there is disagreement over how much spending will slow.
 ''The persistence of high gasoline prices, coupled with lower equity prices and lower consumer sentiment, will restrain the growth of real consumer spending in the second half of 2006,'' Brian Bethune, an analyst with Global Insight, wrote yesterday in a report about the retail sales numbers.
 But many analysts noted that the month's decline in retail sales was exaggerated by poor auto sales, and said that consumers were likely to keep shopping for other goods. 
 ''We do not think that consumer spending growth is going to fall off of a cliff, as there ought to be support derived by gains in wages and salaries owing to job growth,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR Inc. 
 Two indicators of market volatility -- bond prices and gold prices -- pointed yesterday toward renewed nervousness. Gold gained. Bond prices also went up.
 Even though the market swooned this week, analysts said that there were no signs yet that the drop was part of a larger unraveling of the economy. 
 ''The fundamentals of this market are still O.K.,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''The decline is not universal. It's not like stock prices are falling, bond yields are collapsing, commodities prices are collapsing. The stock market looks recessionary, but the commodities market looks like it's expanding.''
 Mr. Rhodes said that with so much bad news clouding the market, ''It's very, very difficult to find out what the real underlying trend is.'' He went on, ''And the longer this goes on, the more difficult it is to find out what's real happening underneath.''

HEADLINE: Arena Is Out As Manager After 8 Years At the Helm 

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
Bruce Arena's eight-year reign as the manager of the United States men's national soccer team is over. 
 Sunil Gulati, the Columbia University economics professor who was elected in March as the president of the United States Soccer Federation, said during a telephone conference call yesterday that a worldwide search will soon begin for Arena's replacement. Gulati, Arena and Dan Flynn, the federation's general secretary, held a five-hour meeting Thursday at LaGuardia Airport. Arena's contract is due to expire at the end of the year.
The decision not to renew Arena's contract rekindled speculation that the federation would pursue Jurgen Klinsmann, who recently resigned as Germany's coach. The list of people under consideration could also include coaches like Gerard Houllier, a former manager of France and Liverpool and the current coach at Lyon in France; and Guus Hiddink, a Dutchman who took Australia to the second round in the World Cup in Germany. Houllier and Hiddink speak fluent English. Hiddink recently agreed to coach Russia's national team, and the U.S. would have to buy out his contract. 
 ''We reached a decision that we will not be renewing Bruce's contract,'' Gulati said. ''For him to be there eight years is unrivaled. He has given the U.S. credibility worldwide and achieved in the summer of 2002 what has caused so much consternation because the expectations were so much higher.''
 The rising expectations were a result of the United States having advanced to the quarterfinals in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea, but they were clearly not met at the tournament in Germany, when the American team finished last in its first-round group and was eliminated. In Germany, Arena was the longest-tenured among the 32 coaches at the World Cup.
 ''Bruce expressed a desire to continue,'' Gulati said. ''I'm sure he'll have opportunities. He had one before the World Cup, but he didn't want to be distracted.'' Gulati would not provide details of that opportunity.
 With a 71-30-29 record, Arena, 54, a New York native, is the most successful national team manager in United States soccer history. He has held the position since Oct. 26, 1998, after having led D.C. United of Major League Soccer to two titles and previously taking the University of Virginia to five N.C.A.A. Division I championships.
 ''I am proud of how far the organization has come over the last eight years and I am extremely optimistic about the future of the sport in our country,'' Arena said in a statement released by the federation yesterday. ''As for me, I am planning to take some time off to weigh my future opportunities.''
 According to published reports, most recently earlier this week in The Washington Post, Arena has discussed a position with the New York Red Bulls of M.L.S. The club, one of the least successful in the 11-year history of the league, recently fired Mo Johnston as its coach and is also looking for a director of soccer operations. It might be viewed as a step down for Arena to return to the sideline in M.L.S., but perhaps he may find a management position more appealing. It is also possible he could combine both positions. Johnston was replaced, on an interim basis, by Richie Williams, who played for Arena at Virginia and with D.C. United.
 Arena, often outspoken about his team and the state of the game in the United States, was able to forge a bond with his players as he assumed the mantle as the de facto spokesman for American soccer. ''Bruce is outspoken, clearly, and that's part of what makes him a great coach,'' Gulati said. ''I don't agree with all that he's said, more often it's with the way he says something.''
 Gulati said the search for Arena's successor would not be restricted to someone who ''holds a U.S. passport or resides in the U.S.,'' but added that the next coach would need ''some knowledge of American soccer, experience, leadership, a track record of success.'' It was an obvious reference to Klinsmann, who lives in Southern California with his family near the United States training base in Carson, Calif. Klinsmann led his native Germany to a third-place finish at the World Cup and has been linked with the American job the past several weeks.
 ''I've outlined one criteria, which is someone with experience and a track record, someone who's a good coach,'' Gulati said. ''Someone to qualify the team and provide leadership. Does Klinsmann fit? He probably does. He's got a much better handle on the American soccer scene than some others, and he's a very inquisitive guy. He's an intelligent, multilingual guy with a lot of very positive qualities.''
 Gulati added that he had not discussed the position with Klinsmann, who said earlier this week that he had ''absolutely no interest'' in the U.S. job. Other possible candidates include Peter Nowak, the Polish coach of D.C. United; Bob Bradley, a former assistant to Arena at D.C. United who is now the coach of Chivas USA; and Sigi Schmid, the coach of the Columbus Crew.

HEADLINE: Bridgeport Mayor Enforces Self-Imposed Penalties

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., July 14 

 BODY:
Through two and a half hours of questioning at the latest ''Ask the Mayor'' session here, a buoyant John M. Fabrizi was eager to talk about the brand-new $390,000 fire engine that federal money just bought for his strapped city. Or the new animal shelter his administration was building. Anything but what was on the top of people's minds: his recent tearful admission that he had used cocaine and abused alcohol since taking office in 2003.
 But when the subject finally came up, as it inevitably does in a city that has battled more than its share of scandal, Mayor Fabrizi hardly strayed from his upbeat tone, apologizing again for having ''made a terrible mistake'' and promising a self-imposed penalty that he thought befit the transgression. 
On Friday morning, the mayor, a Democrat, gave himself a slap on the wrist of sorts in a City Hall speech as he unveiled the details of his plan: he said he would perform at least 100 hours of community service and give $5,400 to the city coffers, which he said the city owes him in retroactive raises. The punishment, he said while again choking up at times, was in keeping with what the judicial system typically requires of first-time drug offenders. For an enhancement based on his status as a public official, Mr. Fabrizi said he also plans to write letters of apology to President Bush, Laura Bush -- he keeps a framed picture of them in his office -- and a third Republican, Gov. M. Jodi Rell.
 ''I realize I have let you down and have work to do in rebuilding your trust in me,'' Mr. Fabrizi, a 49-year-old former schoolteacher, told about 100 supporters and reporters gathered in the City Council chambers for a mea culpa complete with PowerPoint presentation.
 The effort to serve as his own judge and jury was a novel enough act for a public official seeking redemption that not even Marion S. Barry Jr., the former mayor of Washington, tried it during a decade-long effort to reconcile a crack-smoking past with a political future. And for now, there seems little risk that prosecutors will charge Mayor Fabrizi with a drug-related crime, although federal agents continue to monitor city government for corruption.
 At the ask-the-mayor session on Thursday evening, at the Captain's Cove outdoor restaurant and bar, Mr. Fabrizi played down the seriousness of his offense. He told one resident that his drug use was only ''recreational.''
 ''One thing I've heard from folks is, 'Well, Mayor, people have gone to jail for what you did,' '' he said. ''The answer is no. People have not gone to jail for what I did. What typically happens, and you can check with lawyers, is if that person is a first-time offender, they have to go to eight sessions of substance-abuse counseling and they have to perform 32 hours of community service, and when they complete that, whatever record they have is completely expunged.''
 Throughout the evening, as the sun fell over the sailboats moored behind the boardwalk, Mr. Fabrizi's wife, Mary, had a Diet Coke nearby waiting for him if he got hoarse and clapped vigorously whenever he said anything remotely rousing. 
 She said she was ''pushing him'' to run for re-election next year, though when he told the crowd he was grateful to be celebrating his 20th wedding anniversary, she retorted in mock outrage that it had been weeks since that milestone passed and, ''We haven't celebrated yet.''
 Mr. Fabrizi, a diabetic, promised her a hot fudge sundae at the Timothy's ice cream parlor after the event. But they arrived minutes after a gunman escaped on a bicycle with $610 and a cellphone, so the mayor scurried off to ''find the assailant,'' he said. Neither Mr. Fabrizi nor the police caught the robber. 
 Still reeling from the sorry spectacle of seeing the former Democratic mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, sentenced to nine years in prison for running a fraud and racketeering scheme from his City Hall office, Bridgeport residents and civic leaders have had a mixed reaction to the new mayor's efforts to put his misdeeds behind him.
 The Rev. Jonathan Hevita, a Pentecostal minister, credited Mr. Fabrizi for his candor, saying that many families devastated by drug use are ''in denial or just ignore it, and when people in leadership can be honest and open up, he will also help the other men in our community who are struggling.''
 The candor, of course, came only after The Connecticut Post reported on June 16 that an indicted drug trafficker told federal agents in a sworn statement that he supplied drugs to a customer who said the mayor ''needed a hit'' and who claimed to have a videotape of the mayor using cocaine. A tearful Mr. Fabrizi soon admitted using drugs while in office, but said he had sought treatment, been cocaine-free for more than a year, and quit drinking a few months ago. Last week, he submitted to a spot drug test at the behest of The Post.
 Longtime political foes have called for his resignation, while other politicians, including Governor Rell, have said that constituents should decide at the ballot box. 
 Maxine Greenberg, a social worker, worries that the mayor's revelation and need to concentrate on rehabilitation may drag down the city's efforts to revive its economy and regain its reputation. Mr. Fabrizi was elevated from his position as City Council president after Mr. Ganim's criminal conviction, and won a four-year term on his own a few months later. But the bad news hasn't entirely stopped. Just Wednesday, a city building official pleaded guilty to steering asbestos-cleanup work to a company that paid him $8,000 in bribes.
 ''I can't even go through the list'' of scandals in Bridgeport, Ms. Greenberg said after hearing the mayor's comments on Thursday. ''I didn't want a personal apology. I trust he'll handle his personal issues appropriately. But how do we begin to change the perception of Bridgeport?'' 
 Mr. Fabrizi has started by refashioning the office he inherited from Mr. Ganim. He sold the Oriental carpet and city car that symbolized his predecessor's weakness for luxuries. Posted next to the infamous secret staircase that allowed Mr. Ganim's co-conspirators to come and go without drawing attention is a laminated sign -- ''Ethics Check: 1. Is it legal? 2. Is it balanced, 3. Can I live with my decision?''
 On Friday, the mayor said that he would take the advice of civic boosters like Mary-Jane Foster, an owner of the Bridgeport Bluefish minor-league baseball team, to shed some of his 262 pounds and better tend to his health. So he has tuned up his bicycle for the first time in five years and dug his sneakers out of a closet.
 Who knows, Mr. Fabrizi said, his brown eyes still glistening from tears shed at Friday's speech at City Hall, perhaps that back staircase to his office could be used for some overdue exercise.

HEADLINE: Public Schools Close to Private In U.S. Study 

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
The Education Department reported on Friday that children in public schools generally performed as well or better in reading and mathematics than comparable children in private schools. The exception was in eighth-grade reading, where the private school counterparts fared better.
 The report, which compared fourth- and eighth-grade reading and math scores in 2003 from nearly 7,000 public schools and more than 530 private schools, also found that conservative Christian schools lagged significantly behind public schools on eighth-grade math. 
The study, carrying the imprimatur of the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Education Department, was contracted to the Educational Testing Service and delivered to the department last year. 
 It went through a lengthy peer review and includes an extended section of caveats about its limitations and calling such a comparison of public and private schools ''of modest utility.'' 
 Its release, on a summer Friday, was made with without a news conference or comment from Education Secretary Margaret Spellings.
 Reg Weaver, president of the National Education Association, the union for millions of teachers, said the findings showed that public schools were ''doing an outstanding job'' and that if the results had been favorable to private schools, ''there would have been press conferences and glowing statements about private schools.''
 ''The administration has been giving public schools a beating since the beginning'' to advance his political agenda, Mr. Weaver said, of promoting charter schools and taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools as alternatives to failing traditional public schools.
 A spokesman for the Education Department, Chad Colby, offered no praise for public schools and said he did not expect the findings to influence policy. Mr. Colby emphasized the caveat, ''An overall comparison of the two types of schools is of modest utility.''
 ''We're not just for public schools or private schools,'' he said. ''We're for good schools.'' 
 The report mirrors and expands on similar findings this year by Christopher and Sarah Theule Lubienski, a husband-and-wife team at the University of Illinois who examined just math scores. The new study looked at reading scores, too. 
 The study, along with one of charter schools, was commissioned by the former head of the national Center for Education Statistics, Robert Lerner, an appointee of President Bush, at a time preliminary data suggested that charter schools, which are given public money but are run by private groups, fared no better at educating children than traditional public schools.
 Proponents of charter schools had said the data did not take into account the predominance of children in their schools who had already had problems in neighborhood schools.
 The two new studies put test scores in context by studying the children's backgrounds and taking into account factors like race, ethnicity, income and parents' educational backgrounds to make the comparisons more meaningful. The extended study of charter schools has not been released.
 Findings favorable to private schools would likely have given a lift to administration efforts to offer children in ailing public schools the option of attending private schools.
 An Education Department official who insisted on anonymity because of the climate surrounding the report, said researchers were "extra cautious" in reviewing it and were aware of its ''political sensitivity.'' 
 The official said the warning against drawing unsupported conclusions was expanded somewhat as the report went through in the review.
 The report cautions, for example, against concluding that children do better because of the type of school as opposed to unknown factors. It also warns of great variations of performance among private schools, making a blanket comparison of public and private schools ''of modest utility.'' And the scores on which its findings are based reflect only a snapshot of student performance at a point in time and say nothing about individual student progress in different settings. 
 Arnold Goldstein of the National Center for Education Statistics said that the review was meticulous, but that it was not unusual for the center. 
 Mr. Goldstein said there was no political pressure to alter the findings.
 Students in private schools typically score higher than those in public schools, a finding confirmed in the study. The report then dug deeper to compare students of like racial, economic and social backgrounds. When it did that, the private school advantage disappeared in all areas except eighth-grade reading.
 The report separated private schools by type and found that among private school students, those in Lutheran schools performed best, while those in conservative Christian schools did worst. 
 In eighth-grade reading, children in conservative Christian schools scored no better than comparable children in public schools. 
 In eighth-grade math, children in Lutheran schools scored significantly better than children in public schools, but those in conservative Christian schools fared worse.
 Joseph McTighe, executive director of the Council for American Private Education, an umbrella organization that represents 80 percent of private elementary and secondary schools, said the statistical analysis had little to do with parents' choices on educating their children.
 "In the real world, private school kids outperform public school kids," Mr. McTighe said. "That's the real world, and the way things actually are."
 Two weeks ago, the American Federation of Teachers, on its Web log, predicted that the report would be released on a Friday, suggesting that the Bush administration saw it as "bad news to be buried at the bottom of the news cycle."
 The deputy director for administration and policy at the Institute of Education Sciences, Sue Betka, said the report was not released so it would go unnoticed. Ms. Betka said her office typically gave senior officials two weeks' notice before releasing reports. "The report was ready two weeks ago Friday,'' she said, ''and so today was the first day, according to longstanding practice, that it could come out."

HEADLINE: U.S. Reaches Deal With Kyrgyzstan for Continued Use of Air Base 

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
The United States and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement on Friday to allow American and coalition military aircraft to continue using a Kyrgyz air base to support operations in Afghanistan, government officials said. 
 The Kyrgyz government had threatened to evict American and coalition airplanes -- mostly refueling and transport craft -- from the base, at Manas, if the United States did not sign an agreement to pay higher rent and service fees.
An official statement issued in Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic, announcing the resolution of the issue did not say how much the United States would pay for continued use of the base.
 ''The United States will compensate equitably the Kyrgyz government and Kyrgyz businesses for goods, services and other support of U.S. operations,'' Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said on Friday.
 He said the United States expected to provide more than $150 million in total assistance to Kyrgyzstan -- in the form of general aid as well as compensation for the air base -- over the next year, pending approval by Congress.
 The deal was signed in Kyrgyzstan on Friday by James C. MacDougall, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Eurasia, and the Kyrgyz security council secretary, Miroslav Niyazov.
 Access to the airfield became more important after neighboring Uzbekistan last July ordered the United States to leave a base there that had been a hub for operations in Afghanistan.
 The specific reason for the expulsion was a United Nations operation to spirit out refugees who had fled an uprising in Uzbekistan in May 2005. But tensions with the United States had boiled over after Washington criticized the violent government crackdown on demonstrators in the city of Andijon.
 An official statement issued in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, after the talks on Friday said the United States had contributed more than $850 million to support democracy, economic development, aid projects and security in the Kyrgyz Republic since its independence from the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Why Newark Matters

 BODY:
After helping the police chase down a robbery suspect in downtown Newark the other day, Mayor Cory Booker shouted at the man, ''Not in our city anymore.'' The new mayor's words and actions may have been melodramatic, but they symbolized the hopes he has raised for Newark, and for other struggling small cities that are watching his progress. 
 Newark, a city of 270,000, has struggled for years under the burdens of crime, poverty, failing schools and corruption. Mr. Booker has come to power on the promise that he can succeed where others have failed. His personal magnetism, his command of the issues and his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom have attracted national attention to Newark's plight.
Not long after his inauguration on July 1, Mr. Booker announced a typically ambitious plan to reorganize Newark's notoriously inefficient municipal government over the next 100 days. A more cautious public official might have added, as John F. Kennedy did in his inaugural address, that such problems cannot be solved in 100 days, or 1,000 days, or even in the life of a single administration. Instead, Mr. Booker has set a deadline and invited Newark residents to hold him to it.
 His urgency is understandable. Newark's moment is now. If the city is to rid itself of corruption and shady dealing, if its demoralized police force is to be reinvigorated, and if businesses are to be convinced that the city is a sound investment, Mr. Booker cannot afford to linger.

HEADLINE: World Bank Reaches Pact With Chad Over Use of Oil Profits

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, July 14 

 BODY:
The World Bank has reached an agreement with Chad over how to spend the profits of the nation's booming oil industry, with Chad promising to earmark 70 percent of the money to fight poverty. 
 The agreement, announced by the bank on Friday, ends a dispute that threatened to kill an experimental arrangement in which the World Bank agreed to invest in Chad's oil industry if the bulk of the proceeds went toward alleviating poverty. Its aim was to break the so-called resource curse, whereby mineral-rich nations watch their wealth get siphoned by corrupt officials while poverty deepens among the rest of the population.
Chad, a vast, landlocked African nation with three times the area of California, ranked last, alongside Bangladesh, on the watchdog group Transparency International's 2005 index of corruption perceptions, meaning the two nations were viewed as the most corrupt. Chad is also one of the world's poorest nations. 
 The new agreement brings a greater portion of Chad's oil revenue under the control of an independent oversight committee, but also gives the government freer reign to spend the money on things like electricity and telecommunications, rather than traditional poverty programs. 
 ''This is a huge step forward,'' said Paul D. Wolfowitz, president of the World Bank, in a statement. The World Bank agreed to help pay for a $4 billion pipeline to carry oil from fields in the south of Chad to Cameroon long before oil prices boomed. Back then, Chad's distant, hard-to-reach fields were not an appealing investment for private companies. Exxon Mobil, the American oil company working in Chad, ultimately agreed to develop the fields, but only with the World Bank's help.
 In 2000, the bank approved the project and lent Chad $37 million for its stake in the pipeline. Under the agreement, the royalties were to be deposited in an offshore account, and an independent oversight committee was to vet, approve and monitor all spending. 
 The oil began flowing in mid-2004, funneling more than $400 million to Chad. But in October 2005, Chad's government abruptly announced that it planned to put more money into its general budget, avoiding the oversight panel, and that it would increase its spending on security. The government said it was facing a fiscal crisis and a rebel uprising in the eastern provinces that border the volatile Darfur region of Sudan. 
 The World Bank responded by suspending its loans to Chad. After negotiations, a compromise was reached in which the government would be able to spend more money on security and scrap a fund created to salt away oil money for future generations.
 The new agreement covers 2007 only, according to World Bank officials. A final agreement to deal with Chad's oil revenue will be discussed next year, they said.

PERSON: George Wilson Albee 

HEADLINE: G. W. Albee, 84, Psychologist Who Tied Poverty and Illness

BYLINE: By JEREMY PEARCE

 BODY:
George W. Albee, a psychologist and former president of the American Psychological Association who argued that poverty and social deprivation were the root causes of many mental and emotional disorders, died on July 8 at his home in Longboat Key, Fla. He was 84. 
 His death was confirmed by his family.
 Dr. Albee advanced his thesis in the 1960's, when he began to criticize the biochemical therapies that psychiatry had developed to treat mental disorders. Writing in The American Psychologist and other journals, he made a case for considering violence, unemployment, child abuse and social stresses as primary forces that set off psychological problems like depression and anxiety disorders.
 Nicholas A. Cummings, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Nevada at Reno and a former president of the psychological association, debated Dr. Albee's thesis with him in the 1970's, in person and in print. Dr. Cummings recalled that Dr. Albee ''was never timid in taking the position that prescribing medication was almost never appropriate in dealing with mental issues.''
 Dr. Albee believed that many disorders could be better dealt with by easing social stresses, particularly on children. And he argued that a society could prevent mental disorders on a mass scale by reapportioning its resources to address problems in education, housing, drug abuse and nutrition among underprivileged children.
 A collaborator, Justin M. Joffe, a professor of psychology at the University of Vermont, said Dr. Albee had ''concluded a long time ago that you were never going to have the resources to treat enough people in one-to-one therapy, and that you needed the more effective approach of prevention.''
 Much of Dr. Albee's work was based on his reviews of existing studies. He singled out I.Q. tests as an element that helped perpetuate harmful social and racial stereotypes.
 I.Q. tests ''have been shown to have no magical properties,'' he wrote in an Op-ed article in The New York Times in 1978.
 He continued: ''Rather, they are only one of many ways of studying the child. They are more a measure of past achievement and of social-class experience than they are of some mysterious abstraction called intelligence.''
 George Wilson Albee was born in St. Mary's, Pa. He received an undergraduate degree from Bethany College and a master's degree and a doctorate in psychology from the University of Pittsburgh.
 From 1954 to 1971, he taught at Western Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve, in Cleveland, where he was a professor of psychology. Dr. Albee then moved to the University of Vermont, where he was named professor emeritus of psychology in 1992.
 He was president of the American Psychological Association in 1969 and 1970. He was also a former president of the American Association for Applied and Preventive Psychology. Dr. Albee is survived by his wife, Margaret Tong. A previous marriage, to Constance Impallaria, ended in divorce. He is also survived by two sons, Luke, of Washington, and Alexander, of Plymouth, Minn.; two daughters, Marina of St. Petersburg, Russia, and Sarah Albee Willson of Watertown, Conn.; and 10 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Europe's Fading Credit Quality May in Fact Be Welcome News

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
CREDIT quality is declining among Western European corporations, and this year seems likely to be the first since 2003 when more investment-grade bond ratings are lowered than are raised. 
 And that may well be a sign of economic good news.
''What is driving the trend is the realization that the economy is strengthening,'' said Andrea Zazzarelli, an economist with Moody's Investors Service in London. He says the rising number of downgrades among investment-grade companies reflects decisions to invest money, even if that leaves the company with a weaker balance sheet.
 By Asian or even American standards, European economies are not exactly booming. Among the 15 countries that formed the European Union before 10 members, mostly from Eastern Europe, were added in 2004, the gross domestic product grew 2.4 percent in the 12 months ended in June, according to Moody's estimates. If that forecast is accurate, it will be just below the fastest growth rate recorded in more than five years.
 The accompanying charts show that in the most recent 12 months, only 38 percent of Western European rating changes were upgrades, down from a recent peak of 63 percent in the 12 months through last October. 
 If all goes as companies hope, the increased spending in turn should lead to more growth in the future as those investments bring in revenue and profits. 
 That is not, however, assured. There was a huge increase in investment during the late 1990's and 2000, but many of those investments did not work out well after the technology bubble burst. Add in the worldwide economic downturn in 2001, and credit quality became very poor and bond downgrades multiplied. In 2002, there were nearly four times the number of reductions in ratings as there were increases.
 The chart shows that the link between economic growth and bond ratings is not a uniform one. Economic weakness can also cause downgrades, as profits fall. Those cuts may be viewed as involuntary ones, in contrast to the voluntary ones that come after companies decide to borrow money to finance expansion or new investments.
 Another reason for the surge in business spending now is the widespread expectation that the European Central Bank is nowhere near the end of rate increases, even while most economists think the United States Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise rates many more times. If rates are destined to go up, this may be a good time to borrow money, even if the debt does produce a lower bond rating for a time.
 Mr. Zazzarelli said that this round of investment was wise and that ''credit quality will rebound, probably to a higher level than the one we recorded in the latest 2004-5 peak.''
 Of course, he added, ''it could all go pear-shaped like during the technology bubble, but I think that because of it, firms may have learned to be more prudent in their investment decisions.''
 Shareholders obviously think so, too. During the 12 months ended in June, an index of large European companies was up 22 percent, measured in dollars, while major American indexes were up less than 10 percent.

HEADLINE: He's Keeping Many Fingers In Many Pots

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Selling Black Entertainment Television in 2002 and becoming the nation's first African-American billionaire did not squelch Robert L. Johnson's entrepreneurial spirit. This week, he teamed up with Harvey and Bob Weinstein to form Our Stories Films, which will produce feature films aimed at black families. 
 He also recently formed a hotel group, a hedge fund and a private equity fund. At the end of June, he started a student loan company, UTB Education Finance, with Goldman Sachs under the auspices of his new bank holding company, Urban Trust Bank Holdings. 
Mr. Johnson, 60, recently talked about his plans. Following are excerpts:

Q. When will your film company get under way, and what is your goal?

A. Probably the later part of this year and, with our capitalization and the commitment we have for distribution, our goal is to become the pre-eminent African-American studio for family films. I will have sole authority to green-light our choices, and I think there is an attractive audience and demand out there for this kind of film, and a huge amount of underutilized talent in front of -- and behind -- the camera.

Q. What is the target audience for UTB Education Finance?

A. It's principally targeted to African-American urban families who have in some cases a unique need for information about where to go for financing, what government assistance programs are available and financing that can meet their credit qualifications. And added to that, we believe, is enhancing money or credit management to help people to create a good economic portfolio.

Q. Since you left BET, you have started a bunch of new projects. Is there an overall design to these ventures?

A. Yes, the overall design is to create a pre-eminent African-American financial management company. I have the capital, I have strategic relationships and because of my track record of taking BET from basically a start-up business and selling it to Viacom for $3 billion, I can attract people who believe I have the ability to create wealth and economic opportunities for themselves.

Q. You have talked about opening bank branches in some new places including some major outlets like Wal-Mart?

A. We've had some very good discussions with Wal-Mart, and we're at a level now where we're exchanging confidentiality agreements that would allow us to explore opportunities and stores that would be suitable for the target markets that we want to be in.

Q. Among your firsts is being the first African-American owner of an N.B.A. team, the Charlotte Bobcats. You said you would cut ticket prices in the coming season to boost attendance. What are the problems there, and what is the prognosis?

A. The problem there is that when we moved into a brand new arena, I think we probably raised our prices greater than what the market was ready to pay for an expansion team. We have adjusted our prices downward to accommodate more fans and to allow the team to build more support. The prognosis is extremely bright because Charlotte is a growing city with a growing economy. Plus we just brought in Michael Jordan as a partner to oversee basketball operations.

Q. How do the Bobcats mesh with your other business ventures?

A. The Bobcats mesh very well because part of being who I am is having your brand visible. By being in basketball, it brings you in contact with the players who are celebrities and celebrities who like basketball. And that gives you the ability to leverage your basketball business as well as your asset management because now people know who you are.

Q. Your hotel venture -- RLJ Development -- is the country's biggest African-American hotel ownership company. What's next for it?

A. The hotel cycle still seems to have growth in it, occupancy is up, revenue per available room is up and supply is low so it's good to be in the hotel sector at this particular time. What's next for us, probably, is creating a commercial real estate firm to do a broad range of development and acquisitions.

Q. Where do you see the RLJ Companies five years from now?

A. I think it's possible the RLJ Companies could become a publicly traded financial management firm, much the way you look at Lehman Brothers or Goldman.

HEADLINE: Surge in Violence Abroad Overwhelms Markets

BYLINE: By Mickey Meece

 BODY:
TERRORISM in India and escalating violence in the Middle East were collectively too much for stock investors. The Dow industrials alone lost nearly 400 points in three days. Energy prices soared.
 In Europe, regulators put their foot down on Microsoft, and a court ruling left two music companies wondering if their 2004 merger would come undone.
 In Washington, the Bush administration welcomed a Treasury secretary and predicted a decline in the budget deficit. In Japan, the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in six years.

VOLATILE MARKETS -- Major stock indexes fell sharply in the wake of geopolitical upheaval as Israel began fighting militants on a second front, in Lebanon. It had already been battling with Hamas forces that control the Palestinian government. Major United States gauges ended the week in the red. The Dow declined 3.17 percent; the Nasdaq plunged 4.35 percent; and the S.& P. fell 2.31 percent. 
 In New York, crude oil for August delivery settled at $77.03. 
 If energy prices continue to rise, the Federal Reserve could continue lifting interest rates to tamp inflation.

NEW TREASURER IN TOWN -- Henry M. Paulson Jr., late of Goldman Sachs, arrived in Washington to start his job as Treasury secretary. That same day, China reported that its global trade surplus in June reached $14.5 billion, a record.
 Mr. Paulson, who made frequent trips to China for Goldman Sachs, is expected to use his influence to try to persuade Chinese officials to close the trade gap with the United States. 
 China has allowed its currency to appreciate modestly against the dollar. Economists say the United States and Europe will pressure China to allow it to appreciate more against the dollar and other currencies. 

UP FROM ZERO -- In a unanimous decision, the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate a quarter-point, up from zero. The central bank also slightly raised the rates that banks charge each other.
 Recent data showed that consumer and wholesale prices were starting to climb after years of falling. In a statement, the bank said the shift would ''contribute to ensuring price stability and achieving sustainable growth in the medium to long term.''
 The bank promised to move slowly so as not to send a shock wave through its $4.6 trillion economy or stall its recovery.

ANTITRUST FINE -- Europe found Microsoft to be in violation of a 2004 antitrust order and fined the company $357 million. Microsoft has three months to pay. The company plans to appeal to the Court of First Instance, the European Union's second-highest court.
 Fines could double starting July 31, the European Union said, if Microsoft failed to share ''complete and accurate'' technical information on its Windows operating system with competitors. 
 European authorities are raising questions about Microsoft's next operating system, Vista, which the company hopes to begin selling to consumers in January.

MERGER DERAILED? The Court of First Instance, in Luxembourg, overturned the approval of the two-year-old merger of Sony Music and BMG, now Sony BMG Music Entertainment.
 The parent companies, Sony and Bertelsmann, insisted that the ruling did not invalidate their merger. European Commission antitrust regulators, whom the court criticized for their initial review, must now re-examine the combination.
 The commission has several choices: it could approve the deal, order the companies to make divestitures, or dissolve the venture. Lawyers in Brussels suggested that the commission would probably not block the deal. 

DEFICIT DECLINE -- The White House predicted that the budget deficit would decline for a second year, thanks to a 11 percent spike in tax receipts from corporate profits and individual investment income.
 The deficit for fiscal 2006, ending Sept. 30, is expected to be $296 billion, down from $318 billion in 2005.
 The surprising surge in tax revenue -- up nearly 26 percent in the nine months that ended in June over the year-earlier period -- could evaporate quickly. The government is now predicting deficits of more than $100 billion a year through 2011.

HEADLINE: Setting New Tone on Concessions, Bloomberg Yields to Union's Push for Raises

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
If Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had any motto in negotiations with the city's unions, it was that the unions had to agree to money-saving concessions to help finance their raises.
 But in reaching a tentative contract on Wednesday with the city's largest municipal union, District Council 37, Mr. Bloomberg appeared to have scrapped that motto.
The settlement, which covers nearly 120,000 city workers, calls for raises of 10 percent over 32 months, according to union leaders, but does not include any concessions, like the one-year wage freeze in District Council 37's previous contract. 
 City officials insist, however, that they are still seeking concessions and are focused on reining in another threat to the city's budget: the spiraling costs for health care and pensions, which will be the subject of coming talks with District Council 37 and other unions.
 Some labor experts have taken a different view, saying that Mr. Bloomberg was all but forced to abandon his demands for money-saving concessions because of the city's projected $5 billion budget surplus and because of the more muscular tone taken by the city's public-sector unions. The District Council 37 deal is important because it is the first one reached in the city's new round of bargaining with its unions, and thus, can set a pattern for the other unions.
 But the city's labor commissioner, James F. Hanley, argued vigorously in a telephone interview on Friday that the Bloomberg administration has in no way abandoned its push for concessions from unions representing more than 300,000 municipal workers. Rather, he said he still hoped to persuade District Council 37's leaders to agree to concessions in pension costs through a new subcommittee, while health care costs will be the subject of separate discussions.
 ''To say that we've abandoned productivity improvements, it's terribly unfair,'' Mr. Hanley said. ''There are many different levels of bargaining in the city.'' 
 Under city labor tradition, negotiations for changes to pensions and health care coverage are often held separately from wage talks.
 The city and the union are scheduled to officially announce the settlement on Monday, but on Thursday several union leaders at District Council 37 disclosed details of the settlement, among them, relaxing the rules requiring that workers live in the city.
 Mr. Hanley said he was aiming to persuade the Municipal Labor Committee, the umbrella group for the city's unions, to agree to the money-saving changes on health coverage, like higher co-payments.
 ''We will be sitting down shortly on the health-benefits issue and cost-containment measures are on the top of the agenda,'' Mr. Hanley said. ''It's not as if we don't have a proven track record here.''
 He pointed to the agreement that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani forged six years ago with the Municipal Labor Committee in which the city's unions agreed to more than $375 million in savings on health coverage. 
 As hard as it might be to change health coverage, obtaining changes in pensions is likely to be harder. For one, the United States Constitution bars any level of government from reducing pensions for current workers because that is seen as abrogating a contract.
 Nonetheless, city officials are hoping to persuade District Council 37 and other unions to agree to less generous pensions for future hires. But that would require action by the State Legislature, most likely meaning that the city and union would have to go jointly to the Legislature to lobby. 
 Soaring health costs have increased the city's health insurance spending while a floundering stock market has forced the city to invest more money to make good on pensions promised to its workers. 
 In 2003, Mr. Bloomberg began pushing for health and pension savings. He called for all workers to pay part of their health costs, perhaps in the form of monthly insurance premiums. 
 ''It is done in virtually every company in the private sector,'' he said.
 He also called for a lower pension tier for new hires, saying ''that would not hurt any single municipal worker but, over a long period of time, would help us to get our pension costs under control.''
 Mr. Bloomberg might paraphrase Willie Sutton -- he is looking for savings in health coverage and pensions because that's where the big money is.
 In the previous round of bargaining, the Bloomberg administration did extremely well in wresting wage concessions from the city unions, securing a one-year wage freeze from many unions as well as a lower starting salary for new hires. But in the recent negotiations with District Council 37, some union leaders and workers felt so bitter about those wage concessions that District Council 37's leaders essentially told Mr. Hanley that wage concessions were off the table.
 Several municipal union leaders said it was a victory for labor that District Council 37's settlement included no concessions. But the president of one of the council's 56 locals, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not yet been announced, said: ''It's ridiculous that people in the labor movement should think that it's a big victory to sign a contract that doesn't include concessions. That shows how weak we've become. Concessions should not be the norm for us.''
 This leader argued that it was not fair for the city to demand concessions on health coverage and pensions when salaries of District Council 37's workers average $28,000 a year and their raises have hardly kept up with inflation.
 Mr. Hanley's hopes of negotiating concessions with subcommittees and the Municipal Labor Committee could face a big problem.
 Now that District Council 37 has signed a tentative contract promising sizable raises, he has lost a powerful bargaining tool. He can no longer warn the union's leaders that unless they accept this concession or that one, the city will hold off indefinitely on signing a deal that provides union members with the raises that they so eagerly await.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 19, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article on Saturday about the tentative contract settlement that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg reached with District Council 37, New York City's largest municipal union, referred incorrectly to laws that prohibit the reduction of pension benefits for current government workers -- a concession the city is seeking from future members of D.C. 37. That prohibition is in the New York Constitution, not the United States Constitution.

HEADLINE: Israel Vows to Rout Hezbollah as Violence Escalates

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Hassan M. Fattah contributed reporting from Beirut for this article, Craig S. Smith from Fafah, in the Gaza Strip, and Jim Rutenberg from Strelna, Russia.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Saturday, July 15 

 BODY:
The face-off between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah escalated sharply on Friday as Israeli jets hit its Beirut headquarters and southern strongholds and Israeli news reports said a Hezbollah drone aircraft packed with explosives struck an Israeli naval vessel, causing severe damage. 
 The Israeli military later reported four sailors were missing. Leaders of the two sides threatened a still more intense war as a barrage of more than 100 Hezbollah rockets flew into Israel, which said it would destroy the power of Hezbollah and drive it from Israel's border.
Smoke billowed across Beirut's southern skyline as the capital found itself the new front line of the conflict. With Beirut under siege and the Lebanese government largely out of sight, many Lebanese grew resigned to a crisis that was largely in the hands of foreign powers. 
 Israeli officials said a defeat of Hezbollah, a radical Shiite militia with strong ties to Syria and Iran, would send an important message to the region and would help Israel in its efforts to undermine the power of Hamas in the Palestinian Authority. They argued it would also help the weak Lebanese government assert control over the entire country. 
 Rather than act against Hezbollah, though, the Lebanese government called on the United Nations, and Arab and foreign leaders to intervene to end the bombardments and force a cease-fire. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora urged the United States to intervene with Israel, but Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, said, ''The president is not going to make military decisions for Israel.'' The United States has urged Israel to avoid civilian casualties. 
 Israel has so far kept its ground troops out of Lebanon, avoiding the kind of full-scale war that kept it bogged down in southern Lebanon for 18 years. But the crisis threatens to destabilize the region. Oil prices topped $78 a barrel. In Iraq, the radical cleric Moktada al-Sadr denounced the Israeli actions, suggesting his militia might step up attacks on the United States. [Page A6.] 
 President Bush, on his way to the summit meeting of leading industrial powers in Russia, called the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon. 
 The Hezbollah rockets killed 2 Israelis and wounded at least 30 others, with 30 more seeking treatment for shock, the Israelis said. In total, more than 300 rockets have hit Israel, killing 4 people and wounding more than 150. Tens of thousands of Israelis were spending the night in bomb shelters.
 Israeli planes bombed the Beirut airport for a second day to tighten the sea, air and land blockade of Lebanon. Eight Lebanese were killed in the airstrikes on Friday, bringing the death total there over the last three days to 66, with more than 200 wounded, the Lebanese police said. 
 The latest battle between Israel and Hezbollah began when Hezbollah guerrillas seized two Israeli soldiers inside Israel. Eight Israeli soldiers were killed in the raid and afterward when Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon. Israeli officials said no cease-fire discussions could start without Hezbollah returning the two soldiers and laying down its arms.
 Israeli officials said their strategy was to diminish or destroy the power of Hezbollah, which has created ''a state within a state'' in southern Lebanon, and to ensure that the Lebanese Army replaced Hezbollah on the border with Israel, as demanded by the United Nations. ''We've decided to put an end to this saga and to change the rules of the game whereby a terrorist organization that is part of the Lebanese government can push the region to the abyss,'' said Isaac Herzog, a member of the Israeli security cabinet.
 But Hezbollah remained defiant. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was unhurt in the bombing of the apartment building that serves as his home and headquarters. He responded angrily in a televised statement, promising a wider war. 
 ''You Zionists,'' he said, ''you wanted an open war and you will have it,'' and he promised ''to reach Haifa and even farther.'' He continued: ''You want your government to change the rules of the game? This game will change. Now you know whom you're fighting with. You are fighting the sons of Muhammad and Ali.''
 The Israeli vessel damaged by a blast was described by the news media as being a missile ship with several dozen sailors aboard. The military said the ship had suffered severe damage and was being towed back to Israel. Hezbollah said the ship had been struck by a remote-controlled aircraft. 
 Hezbollah has 10,000 to 12,000 rockets of varying ranges and types, said Brig. Gen. Ido Nehushtan, a member of Israel's general staff, most of them provided by Syria and Iran. Most of the rockets landed in the northern Israeli towns of Nahariya and Safed. Two more Israelis, a woman and her grandson, 5, were killed and 10 wounded, including 3 other children, when a rocket fell on their house in Meron. 
 Israel hopes that the Lebanese government, pressed by the international community, will move its army into southern Lebanon, and believes that Lebanese and some other Arab states are happy to see Israel take on one of the poster boys of radical Shiite Islam. But it is also true that Lebanese anger could turn sharply against Israel. 
 Israel has also been buoyed by the mild reaction of governments in the region, which have not come to Hezbollah's defense -- not even Syria and Iran, which have limited their involvement to angry condemnations of Israel's actions. Israel was also pleased by a statement from the Saudi government on Thursday that blamed Hezbollah for adventurism and called on it to end the crisis.
 ''A distinction must be made between legitimate resistance and uncalculated adventures taken by elements inside Lebanon and those behind them without recourse to the legal authorities or consulting and coordinating with Arab nations,'' said a statement published by the official news agency SPA. ''These elements should bear the responsibility for their irresponsible actions and they alone should end the crisis they have created.''
 As Israeli bombs fell, the main streets of Beirut's southern suburbs were virtually deserted on Friday, with residents fleeing for safety or holed up in their homes. Electricity was cut off in large parts of the city after a nearby power plant was bombed. Israeli officials said they dropped leaflets in southern Beirut, warning residents to leave, before the bombardments. 
 Some said the siege was bringing the Lebanese people together. ''We are all unified; we need each other and have to figure out how to live,'' said Mousa Hijazi, 65. He was thrown out of bed when bombs struck a bridge leading to the airport, engulfing the neighborhood in smoke.
 The State Department on Friday advised Americans to consider leaving Lebanon when conditions permitted. But the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said no employees from the American Embassy in Beirut had left because there was no way to leave. Pentagon officials said they were conducting contingency planning for possible evacuation of embassy personnel and other Americans. 
 Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel has vowed that he has no intention of negotiating a prisoner exchange either with Hezbollah or with Palestinian militants in Gaza, who entered Israel on June 25 and also captured a soldier. Israel is engaged in a simultaneous military effort in Gaza, from which it withdrew its settlers and troops a year ago, in what one Israeli official described as a ''war on terrorism that is making a point on two fronts'' against Hamas and Hezbollah, both semistate actors that are not following the rules of sovereign states.
 Israel is continuing to strike at southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah has set up numerous landmines and booby traps. ''There are many ways of pushing them back from the border,'' General Nehushtan said. ''The ground forces are ready,'' he said. ''No one will tolerate the presence of Hezbollah forces along the border, operating freely as a state within a state, operating against Israel as it pleases and holding Israelis hostage, choosing when to pull the trigger.''
 A senior Israeli politician in the government, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said: ''In Lebanon and Gaza we took unilateral steps and withdrew and thought we'd have tranquillity. They interpreted it as continued weakness, and we are determined to break this pattern.''
 The Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, said the airstrikes would continue until the Israeli soldiers were returned and the Lebanese government took responsibility for Hezbollah's actions. Israel, he said, also wanted to deliver ''a clear message to both greater Beirut and Lebanon that they've swallowed a cancer and have to vomit it up, because if they don't their country will pay a very high price.'' Asked about possible Syrian intervention, General Halutz said, ''There's no reason for the Syrians to jump into a pool they might drown in.''
 Guy Bechor, an analyst who heads the Middle East Division of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said Hezbollah would be forced to back down by the airstrikes. ''Facing this aerial machine, Nasrallah can do little,'' Mr. Bechor said. ''And it will lead to its defeat. Israel is not going for an understanding with Hezbollah, but for a victory.''
 Israel needs a few more days, Mr. Bechor said, to get the message across, and it will echo in Gaza, he said. ''New parameters in Lebanon will make it easier for Israel with the Palestinians,'' he suggested. Those parameters include the refusal to negotiate for hostages and the careful but sustained use of overwhelming military force to punish attacks on Israel and its soldiers from territory Israel does not occupy.
 In Ramallah, on the West Bank, an American assistant secretary of state, David Welch, met with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Welch called for all sides ''to exercise restraint'' and said the issue of the captured Israeli prisoner in Gaza ''must also be addressed between the Israelis and President Abbas, free from any interference by any outside party.''
 Mr. Welch appeared to be referring to the complaint of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt that he had worked out the outlines of a package deal that would have released the Israeli in return for later concessions, but that other countries, presumably Syria and Iran, working through the exiled Hamas political leader, Khaled Meshal, had encouraged the militants to reject the deal.
 In Gaza, Israeli troops pulled out of central Gaza Thursday night after two days of fighting, having cut the territory in two. Early Friday, Israel bombed the offices of Hamas lawmakers, hit a bridge and fired a tank shell that killed a Palestinian. 
 Israel, which had destroyed the Gaza offices of the prime minister, foreign minister and interior minister, on Saturday morning struck the offices of the economic minister.
 About 50 masked Palestinian gunmen briefly took over the closed Rafah terminal between Gaza and Egypt, allowing as many as half of the 4,000 or so Palestinians stranded in Egypt to enter Gaza, according to some of those who came through. Efforts to stop the gunmen by the Palestinian police and the Egyptian border police failed, but there was no gunfire. The Egyptians prevented Palestinians from entering Egypt.
 Since the Israeli soldier was captured June 25, about 95 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip, 60 of them militants, said Bassam Eid, the director of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group. Among the dead are 11 Palestinians under 18 years of age. Three Qassam rockets launched from Gaza landed in the Israeli border town of Sderot, but caused no damage.

HEADLINE: Lebanon's Government, Once Bold, Keeps a Low Profile

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Nada Bakri contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, July 14 

 BODY:
They came into office waving Lebanon's flag, victorious over Syria, promising to usher a new age for Lebanon. But as the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora faced the country's most significant crisis in a decade, its officials disappeared from public view. 
 As the country underwent the third day of Israeli bombardment on Friday, the cabinet remained behind closed doors, reportedly brainstorming ideas for a solution. Officials and ministers who normally sought out the press suddenly switched off their cellphones or had assistants screening calls. There were no visits to bombed-out buildings, no photo opportunities at the hospital with the injured and no fiery speeches in defense of the country. 
What the government did was call for the international community to help. ''The government is obviously incapable of taking the lead -- Hezbollah long ago did that,'' said Lamis Karaoui, 27, a lecturer at a private university in Beirut. Hezbollah, she said, now ''makes decisions of war and peace, and acts as if it was the government.'' 
 Mr. Siniora became prime minister last July, seeking to build legitimacy for the government and foster independence from Syria, which had occupied Lebanon for 29 years until it was forced to withdraw last year. The prime minister promised to settle growing sectarian squabbles, restart Lebanon's faltering economy and reduce Hezbollah's firepower while supporting its right to resist. 
 He included members of the militant group into his cabinet, and opened lines of communication with its leaders, hoping to goad them into backing his agenda. But Hezbollah worked to deepen its grip, trying to switch the focus from its arms to issues outside Lebanon, like Israel and the Palestinians. 
 Hezbollah, this week, seemed to be winning. 
 ''Hezbollah wants to play on the old rules and the government wants to play by new rules, but it doesn't want to actually change them,'' said Hazem al-Amin, a columnist with the pan-Arab daily newspaper Al Hayat. ''If they ask the Americans to do something about Israel, the Americans will ask them what they can offer in return. And they can't offer anything.'' 
 The government, caught between the international community, which has demanded that it disarm Hezbollah, and the militant Shiite party, which has sought to usurp the government's authority, has been reduced to taking no stand and promising little action. 
 ''We are trying to secure a comprehensive cease-fire and end the blockade -- this is our priority now,'' he said in a terse statement to reporters on Friday evening, before slipping back behind closed doors. 
 He sought support on Friday from leaders including President Bush, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan, an official close to Mr. Siniora said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The prime minister urged the leaders to ''exert all possible efforts to pressure Israel to agree to a cease-fire and halt its aggression against Lebanon,'' the official said.
 The government has eagerly awaited a possible United Nations Security Council statement calling for a cease-fire. But to allay Arab fears, Mr. Siniora quickly emphasized that no deals would be made with Israel. ''Lebanon will not be part of any deal and will be the last country to sign a peace treaty with Israel,'' he said. 
 With all the of Lebanon's contradictions stacked against him, analysts say, laying low may be the only logical course of action. 
 ''If they come on the scene too much, they will have to take a stand and they cannot take a stand because they are weak and divided,'' said Timur Goksel, a lecturer at the American University of Beirut and a former United Nations official in southern Lebanon. ''So the best possible thing for them to do is disappear.''
 Yet the government also lost opportunities to win over Lebanese, Mr. Goksel noted. A more visible effort by the government to manage the cleanup after the bombings, especially in the south of Lebanon, could have shored up the government's authority. A more public effort to evacuate and aid displaced families could have won further support.

HEADLINE: Putin Critics Get Bush's Ear, but Putin Gets the Hug

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, July 14 

 BODY:
President Bush met with some of President Vladimir V. Putin's most persistent critics upon arriving here Friday, in a signal of concern to his uneasy ally about the tenuous state of Russian democracy. 
 The meeting came just hours before the two and their wives dined together privately at the 1,000-room Konstantinovsky Palace in nearby Strelna, where Russia is to play host to the annual summit meeting of the world's largest economic powers starting Saturday.
The pro-democracy and civil society advocates at the Friday meeting, held at the United States Consul General's landmark 19th-century residence here, said Mr. Bush told them that he had serious questions about a rollback in Russia's democracy as Mr. Putin centralized presidential control, and that he would discuss his concerns with Mr. Putin this weekend in private but would not lecture him publicly. 
 Doing so, officials have said, would embarrass Russia during its big moment on the international stage in all of its newly resurgent -- if controversial -- might. And the administration, while wary of many of Russia's actions of late, still needs its help on crucial issues, most important reining in the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea.
 Yet the meeting served as something of its own public rebuke, with international news coverage of vocal Putin critics sharing their worries about his authoritarian turn and drawing attention to civilian deaths in Chechnya.
 Tanya Lokshina, a rights worker active there, said she handed Mr. Bush a picture of five Chechen children who were killed by a Russian bomb. 
 ''He promised he would share whatever problems were brought to his attention, and that he would discuss them with Putin,'' Ms. Lokshina, chairwoman of Center Demos, said.
 The presence of another attendee, Irina Yasina, was a statement by itself. She is the project director of the Open Russia Foundation, a private nonprofit organization founded by the jailed oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. Its bank accounts have been frozen by the Russian government, and it is in danger of being closed in what Ms. Yasina has called retaliation for Mr. Khodorkovsky's political activities.
 Coming out of the meeting, Mr. Bush told reporters that he had spent a lot of time listening and had assured the attendees ''that the United States of America cares about the form of government in Russia, that we believe in the universal values embedded in democracy.''
 But, he added, ''the foreign policy of my administration is that we will work with Russia to solve common problems and at the same time be in a position where you can have private exchange of ideas.''
 Indeed, even as Mr. Bush sat with the rights advocates, administration officials were meeting with their Russian counterparts in Moscow to wrap up a deal paving the way for Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization -- a long-sought goal for Mr. Putin that the United States has blocked. Officials have said a deal is possible this weekend. 
 Officials of the two nations are also preparing to hash out a civilian nuclear-fuel-sharing agreement. 
 But Mr. Putin broke somewhat with the administration on the most pressing crisis of the moment, the face-off between Israeli and Hezbollah, echoing French and European Union officials' accusations of excessive Israeli force in military strikes on Lebanon and their calls for a cease-fire.
 Mr. Bush arrived under brilliant blue skies here from Germany, after two days of apparently friendly meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel in her home province. 
 It was that sort of spirit Mr. Bush was hoping to share with Mr. Putin too, even as tensions between their nations are at arguably their highest point in Mr. Bush's presidency. Their dinner Friday was to be followed by personal meetings on Saturday.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Putin lashed out at Vice President Dick Cheney for a speech in May in which he accused Russia of using its energy resources as ''tools for intimidation and blackmail,'' saying the vice president's words were tantamount to ''an unfortunate shot while out hunting'' -- a wry reference to the accident last winter during which Mr. Cheney shot a hunting partner in the face.
 Asked what he thought of that comment on Thursday, Mr. Bush said, ''It was pretty clever, actually, quite humorous -- not to dis my friend, the vice president.''
 Mr. Bush unwound before dinner with Mr. Putin by mountain biking.
 Later, on the grounds of the Konstantinovsky Palace -- which Peter the Great broke ground on nearly 300 years ago as Russia's Versailles and which Mr. Putin has spent more than $200 million to renovate -- Mr. Bush and the first lady drove up in an electric golf cart to the cottage where the dinner was held. 
 When Mr. Putin met Mr. Bush at the front walk the two shook hands, then hugged. Before they went into the cottage, Mr. Putin showed an old but pristine Russian automobile, a Zaporozhets, that Mr. Putin said was the first he owned, as a student, in 1972. 
 Shortly afterward, the first couples emerged on a balcony and Mr. Bush was asked about his relationship with Mr. Putin. ''Solid friendship,'' Mr. Bush said. Before walking back inside, he added, ''Go find some Russian vodka and relax.''


CORRECTION-DATE: November 1, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about Lithuania's political dispute with Russia over oil rendered incorrectly a word in a quotation from Vice President Dick Cheney, who had commented on Moscow's use of energy exports as a political tool. He said oil and gas were ''tools of intimidation or blackmail'' -- not ''and blackmail.'' (The error also appeared in articles on May 6, May 14, June 29 and July 15.)

HEADLINE: No Rain on the Stock Options Parade 

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN 2004, when regulators were considering requiring corporations to treat stock options as expenses, many executives complained bitterly. They argued that such a change would severely reduce their ability to use options to attract and retain top talent. Yet a new study suggests that these companies were doing little more than crying wolf.
 Before the accounting change, which was adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in December 2004 and took effect in 2005, a company's earnings statements did not have to reflect the cost of an option until it was cashed in -- typically several years after it was granted. After the change, companies were required to begin deducting the cost of options in the year of the grant. 
 The new study, conducted by H. Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at the University of Michigan, finds no evidence that the accounting change has had a dampening effect on the number or value of options that the average publicly traded company grants to its executives. On the contrary, depending on how the dollar value is calculated, options grants in 2005 were at their highest level since the peak of the Internet boom in early 2000.
 Professor Seyhun based his study, which is unpublished, on data collected by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because companies must immediately inform the S.E.C. when they grant options to their executives, and because most of the options that companies grant to their employees go to executives, Professor Seyhun says he is confident that the database paints a comprehensive picture of companies' practices.
 The professor found that, at least so far, the new rule has led to no meaningful decline in the proportion of publicly traded companies that grant options to executives. That's revealing enough. Even more telling is that among companies that grant them, the average number of issued options grew 24 percent in 2005, the year the rule took effect. 
 And what about high-tech companies, which were supposedly the most sensitive to the rule change? Professor Seyhun said the data showed no decline in options issuance for that sector: The share of high-tech companies granting options to executives in 2005 -- 81 percent -- was identical to the average of the previous five years.
 How could all this have been missed by other researchers? Professor Seyhun suspects that it's because the number of companies that granted options in 2005 was so much lower than it was before the Internet bubble burst. Some 3,963 companies on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq granted options to executives in 2005, down about 25 percent from 5,265 in 2000. 
 That decline might lead many people to think that the use of options was shrinking. Not so, according to Professor Seyhun, because the total number of companies listed on those exchanges declined by almost as much. So the percentage of companies that grant options to executives has stayed more or less the same.
 Of course, the value of an options grant to the recipient depends on many factors besides the sheer number of options. Also relevant is the number of years before the options expire, for example, and the amount by which the underlying stock must rise before options can be cashed in. But in examining these other factors, Professor Seyhun found that the accounting change had no apparent effect on companies' use of options.
 DURING the debate over the rule change, Clifford S. Asness, managing principal at AQR Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn., strongly supported the shift. Mr. Asness, who wrote an article published in the July-August 2004 issue of The Financial Analysts Journal entitled ''Stock Options and the Lying Liars Who Don't Want to Expense Them,'' argued that once the new rule was adopted, companies' earnings statements would be more accurate. 
 When told of Professor Seyhun's findings, Mr. Asness said: ''Some tried to scare us with the dire consequences of expensing options. These forecasts of doom have not proven out, which is not surprising since telling the truth usually entails little such peril.''

HEADLINE: Is It Deal Time Again In the Oil Patch?

BYLINE: By NORM ALSTER

 BODY:
WHEN Anadarko Petroleum announced last month that it would pay $21 billion to acquire Kerr-McGee and Western Gas Resources, shares of other domestic oil and gas producers climbed. Anadarko offered an overall premium of more than 40 percent above market price for the companies -- suggesting to many investors that other drillers were undervalued and that more deals were in the offing. 
 ''What we're looking at is the prospect of bigger acquisitions,'' said John E. Maloney, chief investment officer at M&R Capital Management.
Everyone, it seems, had a different nominee for the most likely target. UBS urged investors to buy shares of Nabors Industries. John Kilduff, an analyst at Fimat USA, cited Murphy Oil as a potential buyout candidate. 
 And Kurt H. Wulff, president of the energy research firm McDep Associates, who correctly predicted this year's run-up in oil prices, named Encore Acquisition as his favorite takeover possibility. 
 Encore, founded in 1998 by I. Jon Brumley, the former chief executive of Mesa Petroleum, has specialized in buying oil and gas fields and coaxing more production from them. Based in Fort Worth, the company has attractive properties in the Cedar Creek Anticline of Montana and North Dakota, Mr. Wulff said, along with the prospect of improving earnings as it increases recovery rates from its wells. 
 But when asked if Encore had been approached by any potential buyers, Mr. Brumley replied swiftly: ''No. We haven't been approached.'' Nor was Mr. Brumley convinced that Anadarko's thrust heralded a surge in buyouts. ''I feel like that's a unique deal,'' he said. ''I just don't know if it signals there'll be a lot of deals or not.''
 That is the high-stakes question: Are the Anadarko deals pricey exceptions, or do they reflect a broad undervaluation of the domestic driller industry? 
 One who sees the deals as an aberration -- and such skeptics are hard to find these days on Wall Street -- is Benjamin Dell, oil and gas analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''After every deal, everyone jumps on the bandwagon without actually thinking it through,'' he said. 
 The Anadarko deal was ''an expensive mistake'' and did not set a benchmark for industry valuations, in Mr. Dell's view. ''Often you see a lot of M & A activity when people believe the current environment is sustainable,'' he said. Mr. Dell says he does not believe that current oil prices are sustainable, but he is in the minority for now. 
 Bulls argue that energy stocks are undervalued because they reflect the fearful assumption that oil will fall well below its current price -- which closed on Friday above $77, amid fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. ''The stock prices are not reflecting the underlying commodity prices,'' Mr. Kilduff said. 
 Oil, meanwhile, is becoming harder to find even as demand rises from China and other industrializing nations. 
 ''It's just cheaper to buy oil than to drill for it,'' said David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management. A self-proclaimed contrarian who often resists prevailing investment currents, Mr. Dreman is willing to be swept along on this wave. ''I'm not a contrarian on this,'' he laughed. 
 An exceptionally warm winter has left natural gas looking ''somewhat cheap relative to oil,'' he said, and he favors the stock of the Apache Corporation, which is based in Houston and has both natural-gas and oil holdings. 
 Mr. Maloney favors ATP Oil and Gas, a much smaller producer that is also based in Houston. At $40.62, the stock is selling at less than four times this year's expected operating cash flow of $11.50 a share, he said. (Over the last decade in this industry, he said, more customary multiples of operating cash flow have been seven or eight.) By 2008, he added, ''operating cash flow could grow dramatically'' as new North Sea gas fields begin production. Mr. Maloney says he has owned the stock for over a year, initially buying in at less than $15. Since the Anadarko deal, he said, he has added ''thousands of shares.'' 
 ATP could fetch as much as $73 a share if it is acquired, Mr. Maloney said. Even without a deal, ATP is worth roughly $60 a share in his estimation -- assuming that oil remains roughly at its current price.
 The Chesapeake Energy Corporation, based in Oklahoma City, is also undervalued, Mr. Maloney said. At $29.47 a share, Chesapeake sells for just over four times estimated 2006 operating cash flow of $7. It could fetch $50 a share in an acquisition, he said, or about $40 without a deal -- again, assuming that energy prices stay put at current levels. Chesapeake has benefited from selling its gas in the futures market at prices higher than the current $5.50 per million B.T.U.'s. ''On average, they're getting $8-plus from futures contracts,'' Mr. Maloney estimated. 
 There has also been considerable insider buying of the stock. In June, the company's chairman and C.E.O., Aubrey K. McClendon, bought more than one million shares on the open market at prices between $27 and $30. 
 Much of Mr. Maloney's enthusiasm is based on his reading of the supply-and-demand equation. Noting the difficulty of finding new reserves ''in places that are politically and economically stable,'' he sees a shrinking cushion of energy supply over demand. ''Everybody thinks these prices are a huge aberration and I just don't think that's the case,'' he said. 
 If Mr. Maloney and other price bulls are wrong, investors loading up on oil stocks now may face serious disappointment. Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research in Amherst, Mass., described himself as ''one of the last bears'' and says he expects oil prices to tumble. ''I think oil will be under $40 a barrel a year from now,'' he said. 
 Prices have stayed high because of geopolitical concerns, Mr. Lynch said, but he sees demand growth as slowing. The Energy Information Administration also recently detected a slowing in global oil consumption growth, though it still expects the world to consume 1.7 million barrels a day more than it did last year. Mr. Lynch expects growth in consumption of only about 1 million barrels a day ''or a little less '' over an estimated 83.7 million daily barrels last year.
 Investors who stock up on presumed takeover targets face another risk: In the blur of a consolidating industry, it is often difficult to distinguish hunter from prey. Late last year, for example, Mr. Wulff speculated in an interview in Barron's that Anadarko was a likely target -- not an acquirer. Its stock has fallen since the announcement. ''I'm disappointed Anadarko was the buyer,'' he said. ''I thought it would be the seller.'' 
 In one sense, smaller companies are a safer bet because they are less likely to be buyers. But the smaller drillers, warned Mr. Dell at Bernstein, present another risk because they would suffer sharper declines if energy prices turned down.

HEADLINE: The Russians Are Filming! The Russians Are Filming!

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Laura M. Holson reported from Los Angeles for this article, and Steven Lee Myers from Moscow.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
JAMES D. DECK and James Heth -- or ''the Americans,'' as their Russian film crew calls them -- descended 200 feet down a rusty ladder into the blank darkness of one of this city's serpentine subway tunnels, far below a cluttered construction lot near the old Red Army Theater.
 Mr. Deck and Mr. Heth are the creative and technical advisers on ''Trackman,'' a thriller set here, filmed in Russian and aimed at millions of eager moviegoers spread across the former Soviet republics. It is the first local-language film for Monumental Pictures, a joint venture of Sony Pictures Entertainment and the Patton Media Group, a production company backed in part by American investors.
A primary task for the two men is to instill a studio-style work ethic on the ''Trackman'' set and to make sure that the movie is delivered on time and on budget. When the film's director, Igor Shavlak, tells Mr. Deck that cameras will roll in 30 minutes, Mr. Deck raises a good-natured eyebrow. ''Promise?'' he asks. 
 Mr. Shavlak welcomes the prodding. ''The idea is to absorb the American experience'' making films, he said later. ''It is common knowledge we are lagging far behind.'' 
 Not, it would appear, for long. Russia's movie industry, following a torpid decade that mirrored the country's social, political and economic turbulence after the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, is in the midst of a creative renaissance and box-office boom. And Hollywood -- whose producers, distributors and exhibitors rarely pass up a chance to exploit an opportunity -- is spending millions on theaters, distributors and movies themselves.
 ''It's like a gold rush right now,'' says Michael Lynton, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. ''There is a long history of good filmmaking; there are actors and directors who know what they are doing. The trick is getting in at the ground level.''
 Russia, of course, is a land where a rush for gold is a perennial pastime. It is also an unpredictable, unwieldy place that in recent years has routinely rewarded and then confounded the expectations of many fortune hunters. Even so, analysts and film executives all say the movie business here looks more promising and more vibrant than it has in many, many years. 
 Box-office receipts in Russia increased 20 percent in 2005, to $331 million, with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the American accounting firm, predicting double-digit growth in each of the next five years. (Other hot growth markets, based on preliminary data, are Turkey and China.) By contrast, almost every other major Western and Eastern European country had box-office declines last year, as did the United States, where revenue slid 5.7 percent, to $9 billion. 
 The number of tickets sold in Russia jumped 19 percent, to 125 million, in 2005, while movie admissions in the rest of Europe, the United States and much of Asia were either flat or down, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
 Russia's biggest movie distributor is Gemini Film, which 20th Century Fox, a unit of the News Corporation, bought in April. Michael Schlicht, a native of the former East Germany, heads Gemini's Moscow office, and he advises that serious, creative film companies ignore Russia at their own peril.
 ''You have to be here,'' he says.
 ''Trackman'' is the first of three Russian films that Sony plans to make this year with Patton, whose partners include Paul B. Heth, James's older brother, and Shari Redstone, the president of National Amusements, the Boston-area-based company that runs movie theaters. Ms. Redstone's father is the American media tycoon Sumner M. Redstone. 
 Ms. Redstone has also joined with Mr. Heth in Rising Star Media, a five-year-old company that has built two American-style multiplexes that are drawing thousands of moviegoers to the sprawling megamalls sprouting on Moscow's suburban fringes. Rising Star says it has plans for two more multiplexes, including the first in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city.
 Other media companies are interested, too. Fox, which bought the international rights to Timur Bekmambetov's eerie, supernatural blockbusters ''Night Watch'' and ''Day Watch,'' now has 40 employees here, Fox executives said. In March, the Walt Disney Company announced the hiring of a senior executive to expand operations in Moscow. Such moves, mere baby steps by American corporate standards, still illustrate how much has changed, and how quickly, in Russian moviemaking. 
 In the years after the Soviet collapse, the Russian film industry -- an accomplished one, despite state controls -- ground to a halt after losing its government financing. Like other industries, it struggled to adapt to a free market. Most of the old Soviet movie houses -- large halls with single screens -- became casinos or auto showrooms. A flood of mostly cheap counterfeit videos, followed later by DVD's, kept Russians out of what few theaters were left. Even acclaimed films like Nikita Mikhailov's ''Burnt by the Sun,'' which won the Oscar for best foreign film in 1994, was viewed mostly on video.
 In 1997, more or less the nadir of the Russian film industry, producers filmed only 13 movies in Russia, according to Gemini Films and Kinobusiness Today, a Moscow trade publication. The total Russian box office was a mere $6 million, and only a fraction of that was for Russian films. The next year, Russia defaulted on its debts and the ruble plummeted in value, leaving little money for a night out at the movies.
 Then, beginning in 2000, the country's fortunes turned. The political and economic stability that coincided with the presidency of Vladimir V. Putin lifted incomes and fueled a consumer spending boom that, inevitably, left struggling Russians with the once unthinkable: disposable income. While Russia remains poor, with an average monthly income of $350, a middle class is emerging, especially in cities like Moscow, where average monthly income is $1,050, according to government data.
 After years of bounding growth, Russian-made films accounted for 26 percent of the country's box-office revenue last year, according to Russian film executives. Analysts predict that the share may rise to 40 percent in the next few years. With subsidies from the government, Russian film production has doubled since 2002; some 85 productions are under way this year. 
 Unlike other flourishing markets, Russia poses few obstacles to making a movie inside its borders or having it distributed. In China, by contrast, politicians keep a leash on imports, allowing only 20 foreign films into the country each year. India, for its part, is dominated by a tight-knit group of filmmakers who specialize in stylized musicals. That makes it a hard market for outsiders to crack.
 With its relative openness, Russia has become the world's 13th-largest movie market, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Analysts say that the market is likely to keep growing, given Russia's population of 143 million and the many millions of other Russian speakers in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other former Soviet republics.
 Hollywood has taken notice. Last December, as part of a celebration to re-release ''Cinderella'' on DVD, Disney staged a ballroom party for 2,000 children at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, where Communist Party dignitaries once assembled. 
 As snow flecked the Kremlin's golden domes outside, Disney offered cake and candy to aspiring princes and princesses who learned to waltz inside. Disney's animated characters --officially frowned upon by some in Russia when the country was under Soviet control -- twirled on the dance floor. Disney even flew in actors from the United States to sing popular songs from ''Cinderella'' and ''Snow White.'' Several months later, Disney announced that it would expand its presence here, making Russia a top priority. 
 But Disney, typically conservative, is only beginning to ponder making movies; so far, the company says it is more comfortable selling DVD's, books and stuffed animals.
 IN 1996, Paul Heth, with the Eastman Kodak Company as a sponsor, opened Moscow's first modern, American-style theater here, in a converted conference hall near Pushkin Square. He called it Kodak KinoMir, or Cinema World. It was the first theater to show films with digital sound and dubbing that actually stayed in sync. Mr. Heth recalls moviegoers waiting in long lines to see the first film, ''The Rock,'' a Nicholas Cage thriller. The theater sold out for almost every showing during the next two years. 
 ''The good news is, Russians love movies,'' Mr. Heth said. Still, by 2000, there were only about 78 modern screens in 55 theaters throughout Russia, according to industry analysts. Then the boom hit. The number of screens passed 1,000 in 2005 and is expected to reach 1,350 this year.
 But hurdles remain. Shortly before Mr. Heth's company, Rising Star, opened its first KinoStar-branded theater in 2003, the seats arrived without bolts to attach them to the floor. ''I don't want to say doing business there is easy,'' said Mr. Heth's partner, Ms. Redstone. ''It's complicated enough in the United States. But it's even more complicated there.''
 Mr. Heth and Ms. Redstone say their theaters try to evoke the glamour of Hollywood, but with a modern twist. All are air-conditioned, built in suburban shopping malls and anchored by a megastore, like the furniture company Ikea. At the first KinoStar theater in suburban Moscow, attendants show customers to reserved seats. There, on a stage above the concession stand, the Bolshoi Theater's orchestra played one evening. The theater sells beer and wine in the auditorium, as well as local pastries, sandwiches and sushi.
 For some, extravagance has its drawbacks. A night at the movies is not cheap: tickets in Moscow cost more than $9. At first, patrons thought the theaters were ''too glamorous,'' Ms. Redstone said. ''They thought they needed an invitation.''
 Despite pricey tickets, Russian films have recently begun beating out Hollywood's heavily promoted blockbusters by using Hollywood's own tactics, including wide releases and promotional onslaughts -- all of which are marketing novelties here. In 2004, the hugely popular ''Night Watch'' became Russia's highest-grossing film ever, with $16.3 million in Russian box-office receipts, edging out the much-anticipated ''Lord of the Rings: Return of the King,'' which brought in $14 million. 
 Subsequent films made in Russia broke the ''Night Watch'' record. In 2005, ''The Turkish Gambit,'' a historical adventure film, garnered $19.3 million. A few months later, ''Company 9,'' a bloody, emotionally wrought movie about a cadre of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan in the 1980's, pulled in $25.6 million. Mr. Putin viewed a special ''Company 9'' screening at his residence outside Moscow and declared the Russian film industry ''reborn.''
 ''Day Watch,'' the sequel to ''Night Watch,'' opened in January and grossed $34.7 million, three times more than Peter Jackson's ''King Kong.'' The twist is that locally produced Russian hits -- often portrayed here as a backlash against imported American fare -- are being spurred by Hollywood's interest.
 ''Trackman'' bears no resemblance to a Hollywood blockbuster. Its budget is about $2 million and its story is purely Russian: a bank heist goes sour and a group of robbers seize hostages. But it is a touchy theme in a country that in recent years has endured two hostage crises in which hundreds of people died -- the first at a Moscow theater in 2002 and another at a school in Beslan in 2004. The robbers in the film escape into the labyrinthine tunnels under Moscow, only to encounter a mysterious killer, a former K.G.B. agent obsessed with protecting the subway passages that were long rumored to exist as secret escapes for Communist apparatchiks.
 But the American influence on ''Trackman'' is clear. Monumental Pictures oversaw the movie from the start, conducting focus groups to test story themes and even bringing in an American script doctor to polish the prose. Star-making is also part of the mix for film producers because, here as in America, stardom sells.
 ''They also want their own Brad Pitts and Monica Belluccis,'' said Michael Dounayev, the managing director of Sistema Mass Media, which founded Thema Production, a Luxembourg company that has produced two Russian films this year. Thema is converting an unfinished St. Petersburg military warehouse into a 45,000-square-foot production studio, and plans to open it next year.
 The financial risk of making movies in Russia is small: most budgets are between $1 million and $5 million. But other headaches persist -- quotidian problems like securing permits or office space. 
 ''We couldn't get an office,'' said Mr. Lynton at Sony. ''It's not like Shanghai where there are new buildings. And it is not like they are in the best condition.'' 
 To forestall similar problems, studios like Fox will not consider making a movie in Russia without a local producer onboard. Sony has an international executive, Gareth Wigan, who is based in Los Angeles but travels regularly to Russia to oversee the company's films here.
 Mr. Deck says delays that can dog film production anywhere seem compounded here because of Russia's bureaucracy. And, of course, there is the language barrier. Still, his excitement is palpable. ''You can't build this set,'' he said gleefully, peering down a subway tunnel where ''Trackman'' was being filmed.
 Hollywood's biggest challenge in Russia is a well-known culprit: film piracy. DVD's are sold on the street for as little as $2 to $5 on the same day -- and sometimes before -- a movie's theatrical debut. Many are copied directly from movie theater prints, suggesting the work of local industry insiders, not enterprising pirates seated in the back of a movie theater carrying camcorders. Mr. Schlicht estimates that movie studios and producers lose about 90 percent of potential Russian box-office revenue because of rampant piracy. But even that is not deterring the most intrepid investors. 
 ''Russia is a hot market right now because things are actually happening,'' said Tomas Jegeus, co-president of Fox's international theatrical distribution division. ''It is not just a promise of good fortune to come, like in so many other countries.''

HEADLINE: Sizing Up The Banks' Profits 

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WHEN Wall Street frets about Federal Reserve credit tightening and flattening yield curves, shareholders in bank stocks become especially nervous. 
 The profitability of bank shares depends on the general level of interest rates and on differences between short- and long-term rates. Just how dependent will become clearer this week, when many of the nation's largest banks announce second-quarter earnings. 
Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase, Washington Mutual, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are due to report their results. And after warnings from smaller lenders about shrinking interest margins -- the gap between loan and deposit rates -- ''there is a lot of pessimism going into the results,'' said Lisa Welch, manager of bank stock funds at John Hancock Financial Services.
 ''People are worried that margins, which have held up well the last few years, will be squeezed this quarter and that banks will have trouble growing earnings,'' she said.
 But she finds less reason to expect stocks to react badly when the results are announced. Warnings from the sector so far amount to an effort to guide expectations lower, Ms. Welch said, and M&T Bank, a regional lender based in New York, issued a healthy report last week, ''so we can be a little bit hopeful that the numbers will be better than feared,'' she said.
 Other causes for optimism are resilient mortgage demand, even if rates have not risen much relative to deposit and other short-term rates, she said, and solid earnings from specialist investment banks that have already announced results.
 Ms. Welch emphasized that banks seldom report earnings wildly at odds with market projections. Some discrepancies are still possible, though, and other items in the statements, like dividend increases, may give stocks a lift.
 Wells Fargo, which reports on Tuesday, is one of her favorite companies for the ''strength and quality of its earnings,'' she said. But she noted that many investors admire the company, so that strong results might already be ''baked into the number.''
 Opinion on Bank of America, by contrast, appears to be only partly baked. The range of estimates is wider than for the others, Ms. Welch said, making its stock prone to a reaction from traders.
 ''There's always a surprise somewhere'' when banks report, she said. Looking across the sector, she said that ''if results are better than expected, we could see a bit of a rally in the group.''

DATA WATCH -- The likelihood of further Fed tightening will be on traders' minds on Tuesday, when June producer prices are announced, and on Wednesday, when consumer prices are reported. A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts a 0.2 percent increase in both readings, after food and energy items are removed, down from 0.3 percent in May.

HEADLINE: The Aria of the Clanging Soup Spoons 

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
FOR a comically suspenseful moment midway into Act I of his new opera, ''The Greater Good, or the Passion of Boule de Suif,'' the composer Stephen Hartke struck on a clever musical idea. ''It's quite a kick,'' Mr. Hartke said during a rehearsal break the other day from Cooperstown, N.Y., where the work will have its much-anticipated premiere on Saturday at the Glimmerglass Opera. ''It really works nicely.''
 It is 1871, immediately after the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War. A group of French people -- among them a count, a merchant and a manufacturer and their wives; a nun; and a rabble-rousing Socialist -- have traveled from Rouen in a horse-drawn coach, hoping to flee with their money to Le Havre. Also in the group is a prostitute renowned for her buxom beauty, Boule de Suif, which translates loosely as Butterball. 
The trip so far has been fraught with tension, as the proper French people have been forced to interact with the shameless yet decent and generous Boule. And after 13 hours of slogging through February snow, they are detained by Prussian soldiers at an inn in the village of Totes. There they are served a dinner of hardy French soup. Conversation is strained. At one point, the only sounds come from spoons clanking gently against ceramic bowls.
 When he composed this scene, Mr. Hartke said recently at his home in Glendale, Calif., he thought to himself: ''Ah, soup bowls! Why not tune them to specific pitches?'' In the score the pitched clanking becomes an accompaniment to the halting sung conversation during this intricate ensemble scene. 
 Those who know Mr. Hartke's previous works will not be surprised by his musical wit. The pulsing energy, pungent harmony, economy and inventiveness of his music have earned the affable Mr. Hartke, 54, a leading place among American composers of his generation. Some of his pieces exude bracing humor, like the Violin Concerto, which begins with the crackling, unnerving sounds of four percussionists banging drumsticks in sync until the soloist joins in, doodling like some country fiddler. Yet the violin line is so jerky that the music seems oddly stern.
 Even in thoroughly serious works, Mr. Hartke's writing is direct, unsentimental and acutely rendered. Take his Symphony No. 3, written in response to 9/11 and given its premiere by Lorin Maazel and the New York Philharmonic on the opening subscription program of the 2003-4 season. Here Mr. Hartke combined the ethereal voices of the Hilliard Ensemble, singing a fragment of an Anglo-Saxon poem reflecting on the ruins of an ancient Roman city, with dissonance-saturated orchestral counterpoint, skittish rhythmic outbursts, punchy writing for myriad percussion and tremulous harmony. (The Philharmonic's performance was recently released by New World Records.)
 Will these qualities transfer to the opera, Mr. Hartke's first? The postpremiere debate will probably focus on the typical questions confronting contemporary American opera: Does the work hold the stage? Do the characters emerge as fully engaging figures? Is the dramatic pacing and structure effective?
 But my hope is that ''The Greater Good'' will call attention to a more elusive quality of Mr. Hartke's work: his distinctive compositional voice. Matters of style have tended to dominate the critical discourse when a new work is introduced. Is the score tonal or atonal? Cerebral or populist? Neo-Romantic, Neo-Classical or neo-whatever? Is it 12-tone or postmodern? And so on.
 In all the arts -- film, fiction, dance, pop, but particularly classical music -- there has been too much concern with style and not enough with voice. Style is easy to recognize and not that hard to imitate. But defining an artistic voice is hard. One is reminded of Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's famous attempt to define hard-core pornography: ''I know it when I see it.'' Similarly in music, while some composers seem captives of the styles they imitate, others somehow exude a personal voice: Judith Weir, Lee Hyla, Thomas Ades, John Adams and Chen Yi, to name a few composers in their midcareer primes. Stephen Hartke figures prominently in that group.
 During my visit to his home in May, Mr. Hartke, who teaches at the University of Southern California, had much to say about this topic, and about the nearly six-year process of planning and composing his opera. He was not helpful in describing his own musical voice, always a hard thing for a creator to do. But he was perceptive about the question in general.
 ''Voice has to do with the consistency of your musical filter,'' Mr. Hartke said. ''I've always said that my music is about my experience as a listener. I hear music, I think about it. When I compose, I talk about what I love, about what I want to hear.''
 The challenge for composers today in being true to their individual voices is formidable, because they are surrounded by a repository of styles waiting to be picked over and borrowed. To illustrate the difficulty, Mr. Hartke said that two composers born in Hamburg in 1833 (like Brahms) would essentially have grown up hearing the same music. But two composers born in 1952 in New York, even if they lived in the same apartment building, could go through their lives hearing completely different music.
 ''Composing involves filtering through the music you have come in contact with and grown to love,'' he said. ''You must be true to that and not try to deny it.'' 
 Of course, this assumes that your ear is as keen as Mr. Hartke's and that your musical interests are as varied. Growing up in New York, he sang in Anglican church choirs; thus his lifelong devotion to Tudor sacred music. He was not much of a rock fan, though he loved jazz and blues. Critics have found in his works hints of late Stravinsky, bebop, Balinese gamelan music, Messiaen and lush-textured Minimalism akin to that of the Dutch master Louis Andriessen, all influences he acknowledges.
 Still, in letting one's voice emerge it helps to have strong reactions, especially when composing an opera, where the drama often demands music in diverse styles that can depict specific settings. Hearing Mr. Hartke talk about opera composers who intrigue, inspire or infuriate him proved very revealing and entertaining.
 Though he admires Wagner, he called him a ''psychological terrorist.'' ''He makes you like his musical ideas because he plays them so much, he drills them into you,'' Mr. Hartke said. ''Wagner invented the concept of the jingle.''
 His suspicions about Wagner came early. When he was a teenager, he heard the ''Ring'' cycle broadcast complete on the radio and was so incensed at the colossal ego of a four-evening operatic work that he and a friend wrote a 10-minute, 12-tone version of ''Das Rheingold'' with a ''Damon Runyonesque libretto and only one Rhinemaiden,'' he said.
 He respects Benjamin Britten enormously, though he finds him an ''excessively tidy composer.'' Too often Britten let structure take over his music, and let the structure become predictable, Mr. Hartke said. Once the machine is set in motion, he added, the chorus will enter systematically or a dance will ensue, and ''you know you are in for 10 minutes of it.'' 
 His two favorite operas are Monteverdi's ''Orfeo,'' which he reveres for its elegant music and the ingenious simplicity of its dramatic construction, and Mussorgsky's ''Boris Godunov,'' which he much prefers in the composer's original, strikingly spare orchestration, not the plush reorchestrations by Rimsky-Korsakov, Shostakovich and others.
 Why does ''Boris'' affect him so? ''I just love the notes,'' he said. ''In this case, I don't mind hearing the tunes over and over.'' 
 He had always wanted to compose an opera. But when success came his way, with commissions from orchestras and significant foundation grants, he could not find a suitable subject or story, something that would prod him to write a fresh work. 
 In 1994, the conductor Donald Runnicles, who admired Mr. Hartke's music, brought him together with Philip Littell, who had just completed the libretto for Conrad Susa's ''Dangerous Liaisons,'' commissioned by the San Francisco Opera. Mr. Littell and Mr. Hartke soon collaborated on a riveting and unconventional vocal work, ''Sons of Noah,'' for soprano and four each of flutes, guitars and bassoons. (The work has been recorded on New World with Lisa Stidham, Mr. Hartke's wife, as soloist.) 
 After considering numerous ideas, they were drawn to ''Boule de Suif,'' a short story by Maupassant. It had the makings of an intricate ensemble opera, a wry comedy of manners but with a bitter ending. 
 In the Maupassant story an all-knowing narrator fills in the background of characters and the war-torn era. Much of that detail is left out of the opera, which simply presents the story realistically, with no flashbacks and few internal monologues. The audience is, in effect, invited to eavesdrop on the characters, picking up details along the way. This leaves much for the composer to suggest with music.
 Sitting at the digital keyboard in his home studio, Mr. Hartke played through the opera, trying to explain, as much to himself as to me, why his music turned out the way it did. After Boule boards the coach with her disdainful traveling companions, for example, she is content to keep to herself. Until she gets hungry. She is the only one to have thought to bring along a big basket of food. Boule loves to eat. 
 Taking pity on her famished fellow travelers, she shares her provisions. They gush with gratitude. The orchestra breaks into a edgy, restless fugue based on a theme originally heard when Boule makes her first silent appearance. The entwining lines, tinged with dissonance, seem to convey intrigue, people at cross-purposes who are nonetheless compelled to act together.
 But as the travelers enjoy Boule's offerings, they segue into a choral ensemble in praise of goose liver pate, smoked tongue, a slab of cheese, petit-fours, pickled onions. ''The music here seems very religious to me, with a sense of exaltation,'' Mr. Hartke said. 
 In Act II, after the travelers have been detained at the inn, they learn that the Prussian commandant (who never actually appears in the opera) has refused to allow them to proceed unless Boule will be his for the night. Though initially shocked, the other travelers suggest, entice and finally implore Boule to comply. For the greater good, she does. But in the last scene, as the travelers continue on their way, Boule is ostracized and disdained by those whose freedom she has won. 
 Boule is that rare title role that almost calls for a soprano with a fleshy physique. Mr. Hartke's Boule, Caroline Worra, is young and slender. But he could not be happier with her work, and that of the eager and gifted cast, he said. Stewart Robertson, a longtime supporter of Mr. Hartke's music, is conducting; the director is David Schweitzer, who won acclaim for his 2004 Glimmerglass production of Richard Rodney Bennett's mystery opera ''The Mines of Sulphur.''
 Mr. Hartke said that the controversy reported in December over the title of the opera was overblown. Originally it was called ''Boule de Suif, or the Good Whore.'' Officials at Glimmerglass were worried about selling an opera with such a title. The creators willingly changed it to ''The Greater Good, or the Passion of Boule de Suif.'' 
 ''I never liked the original,'' Mr. Hartke explained. For one thing, it was too precise, it gave away too much information. What's more, Mr. Hartke has dedicated the opera to his mother, whose love of theater inspired him as a boy. And honoring your mother with a work called ''The Good Whore,'' he said, was ''just not right.''
 Meanwhile, attending the rehearsals at Glimmerglass has taught him much about a work he composed by letting his filtering ear take over. ''The opera has tended to go its own particular way,'' he said, ''and there is nothing I can do about it.''

HEADLINE: As Oil Soars, Stocks Give Up Gains for the Year

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled and oil prices soared as conflict in the Middle East shook up the markets, wiping out nearly all of the meager gains recorded by the major stock indexes for the year. 
 Oil closed on Friday at $77.03 a barrel in New York, a record, and it traded above $78 during the day.
The week's market declines left the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index in negative territory for the year. Only the Dow Jones industrial average clung to an actual gain -- and it was a scant 0.20 percentage point. 
 The price of oil rippled through the market. Shares of Exxon Mobil, the oil giant, gained 3.31 percent for the week, the best performance among the Dow industrials. Alcoa, the aluminum company, which must make copious use of energy in its refining operations, declined by 8.2 percent, the worst performance in the Dow.
 For the week, the Dow shed 351.32 points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 10,739.35. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 29.28 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 1,236.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 92.71 points, or 4.4 percent, to close at 2,037.35. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 5.06 percent from 5.13 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: The Rising Role Of Private Equity 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Directorship magazine.

 BODY:
THE increasing role of private equity firms in mergers and acquisitions is part of a structural shift in American capital markets, says Robert F. Bruner, dean of the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia and author of ''Deals From Hell'' (Wiley, 2005). Here are excerpts from a conversation: 


Q. Why are so many private equity firms involved in big mergers and acquisitions?

A. This is the natural extension of a wave of private equity investments that began in the late 1970's and has grown almost unremittingly. The growth lately is a reflection of the combination of low interest rates, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and industry turbulence that upsets the standard order of things. Most M.& A. transactions are motivated by strategic response to turbulence in an industry due to inflation, deregulation, commodity shortages, demographic changes and so on.

Q. How much are private equity firms spending?

A. Year to date, the statistics are $117 billion committed in 517 deals in the United States alone. It's anybody's guess, but I would believe that between Europe and Asia we easily see that much more. This compares to $133 billion in the U.S. in all of 2005.

Q. Where is the money coming from?

A. It's coming from institutional investors predominantly -- pension funds, insurance companies and major money management funds, all of whom have a delicious problem, namely more money than they know what to do with. About 40 percent of it is coming from pension funds. So when you ask whose money it is, it is your and my retirement money.

Q. If more activity is taking place privately, does that imply that the government and investors can't really understand it?

A. We can understand private equity investing much better than what's happening in the hedge fund industry. Private equity investment is relatively simple. You borrow a fair amount of money and buy a business with relatively little equity. You enhance the operations, pay down the debt and then exit within five to seven years. Returns might be 25 to 30 percent. We, the investing and consuming public, are a lot better off because of what the private equity firms do. They reorganize and make more efficient the operations of the companies they are acquiring.

Q. Do you have concerns about the trend?

A. I'm a fan of the activities and the industry in general, but I am concerned for these reasons. First, we're seeing the emergence of very big deals like Kinder Morgan's going-private transaction of more than $20 billion. That is close to the famous leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco that occurred in 1988.
 These very big deals tend to occur at market peaks. They are bellwethers of hot markets. And in a hot market, you see entry of less sophisticated investors. You see very aggressive financial structures. You see overoptimism. And typically we see dashed hopes, lower returns, higher rates of failure and even bankruptcies following these peaks. 

Q. In effect, is this a bubble?

A. Whether it is a bubble depends on our ability to assert that the prices are completely out of line with fundamentals. Bubbles occur at market peaks. Whether this is a bubble remains to be seen.

Q. What are your other concerns?

A. Ethics is always an issue that dogs the private equity industry. Why cannot the C.E.O. of a public firm do the same things that he or she intends to do once the firm goes private? For instance, the C.E.O. of a publicly traded company could relever the firm and achieve the same kind of capital structure. He or she could restructure the operations. Why is it that the C.E.O. needs to take the firm private? Journalists, academics and securities analysts are skeptics and critics. We should always ask this question. I'm sure the response today is heavily influenced by Sarbanes-Oxley -- that it's very difficult to take risks and change operations in a world with public shareholders and governments scrutinizing your actions. But we see General Motors undertaking a fairly significant restructuring and yet remaining a public firm. Why can't others do the same?

Q. Do hedge funds invest in private equity?

A. We know hedge funds are investing in private equity deals in a significant way. Hedge funds typically don't invest for the long term. They are very impatient investors. Their very impatience could convey to operating management a short-termism.

Q. What is your other concern?

A. The changing credit standards of banks. These deals are highly attractive to financial services institutions. They not only enable these banks and insurance companies and pension funds to deploy funds into these deals, but also to financial advisers, especially investment bankers, they bring a whole Christmas tree of fees for underwriting, for M.& A. advisory work, for fairness opinions and the like.
 These fees are the high-octane fuel of the investment banking industry. They account for a dramatic rise in the profitability in major investment banks. They have attracted the attention of virtually every broad-line and boutique financial adviser in the world. 
 I worry that the fees so skew the typical concern for probity and conservatism and credit quality that major institutions usually show. We may find deals being structured in the near future that will not stand the test of a recession or market volatility.
 Privately, I've spoken with bankers who worry that deals struck in the past three years are so tightly engineered that they will appear on a list of distressed companies, come the next downturn.

A Nuclear Renaissance?
 Workers at the Alvin W. Vogtle nuclear-power generating station sometimes describe it as being in the middle of nowhere, and in many respects they're right: situated on a bend in the Savannah River, in the thick pine forests of central Georgia, the plant is an hour south of Augusta and a two-hour drive, if you disobey the speed limit, from the outskirts of Atlanta. On the final approach to Vogtle, a narrow country road cuts through vast stretches of undeveloped land punctuated with small ranch-style homes; in some places, you can still discern remnants of convenience stores and cheap motels set back from the pavement, all now shuttered, some barely standing. When Vogtle (pronounced VOH-gull) was being built in the 1970's and 80's, it was more aptly described as the middle of everything, a bustling, improvised city of engineers and tradesmen, some 14,000 workers in all, many of whom lived nearby in tents and trailers. It was one of the largest construction projects in the history of Georgia. An entire concrete factory, now defunct, was built here during that time; so was a factory to manufacture ice, a necessary ingredient in making the superdense nuclear-grade concrete required for the reactor-containment buildings. 
To Ellie Daniel, a local man who has worked as an administrator at Vogtle for more than two decades, only two significant things have happened in the history of Georgia's Burke County. ''One is the Civil War,'' he told me. ''The other is Plant Vogtle.''
The boom that swept through the region as Vogtle rose from the forest floor -- its immense cooling towers are each 548 feet tall -- ended somewhat badly, however, at least in a financial sense. The plant took almost 15 years to move from blueprints to being operational. And by the time it began producing electricity in the late 1980's, its total cost, $8.87 billion, was so far overbudget that Vogtle became yet another notorious example of the evils of nuclear energy. In the public mind, the issue was safety. For the industry, the larger concern was economics. Indeed, as originally designed in the early 1970's, Vogtle was intended to generate a total of around 4,500 megawatts of electricity, enough power to serve the needs of several million homes. The grand plan was to have four reactors. Instead, it was scaled back to two, Vogtle Unit 1 (finished in 1987) and Vogtle Unit 2 (1989). Today these reactors together produce about 2,400 megawatts, satisfying about 15 percent of the state's power needs.
 One day this May, on a brisk morning so clear that I could see its cooling towers from 20 miles away, I visited Vogtle on one leg of a tour to assess what many in the energy industry are calling a nuclear renaissance. Thanks partly to large government incentives and to market forces that have pushed the price of other electric plant fuels (especially natural gas) to historic heights, the prospect of starting a new nuclear reactor in this country for the first time in 30 years has become increasingly likely. By early summer a dozen utilities around the country had informed the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees all civilian nuclear activity in this country, that they were interested in building 18 new facilities, nearly all of which would be sited next to existing nuclear reactors. Vogtle was in this group of 18. In fact, the Southern Company, the large utility that runs Vogtle, also announced that it would formally apply to the N.R.C. next month for an early site permit, the first step in readying the community for a nuclear project that would complement the existing reactors. Whether Vogtle will turn out to be the 1st, 5th or 10th next-generation plant to break new ground is difficult to say; trying to predict which utility will be able to overcome formidable obstacles -- public approval, regulatory scrutiny, billions in financing and complex engineering challenges -- is akin to predicting the winner of a presidential election years in advance. Still, if things move smoothly (a rarity when it comes to nuclear power in this country), the Southern Company will receive a license to build and operate a new plant in 2010. Construction will take five years. Electricity will begin to flow to the residents of Georgia in 2015.
 Over the past year, the debate over nuclear power has increasingly been framed as an environmental one, as several commentators -- most notably Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace (and now estranged from the organization); the British conservationist James Lovelock; and the Whole Earth Catalog founder Stewart Brand -- have stepped forward to assert that global warming requires an embrace of new nuclear plants, because unlike gas- or coal-powered plants, nuclear reactors produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gasses. The nuclear industry, in turn, has capitalized on the chance to adopt a green tinge, or at least greenish one; among its recent slogans is the exhortation to ''Go nuclear: because you care about the air.'' Most environmental groups have not softened their opposition, however. ''This is more a propaganda exercise than a serious discussion of the viability of the industry,'' Jim Riccio, the nuclear policy analyst at Greenpeace, told me. By using global warming, he added, ''the nuclear industry is trying to find some fear greater than the nuclear fear to be their selling point.''
 Nonetheless, whether any new nuclear plants are built in the United States depends less on the sentiments of the American public than on the country's individual utilities. And for conglomerates like the Southern Company, which runs Vogtle as well as two other nuclear plants in Georgia and Alabama, the determining factor is not air quality. It's money. Over the next 12 to 24 months, as utilities like Southern determine what to do, their fundamental concern is the bottom-line cost. And the feeling among many in the industry is that the financial prospects are almost certainly looking up.
 One afternoon at Vogtle, Ellie Daniel took me just west of the plant. The reactors here sit amid 3,150 acres of wilderness; the snap of pine in the air and the low hills that roll toward the riverbank lend it the serenity of a fine vacation spot. We drove past the old concrete factory, past the crumbling foundation of the ice works and halted by a clearing at the side of the road. At the edge of the clearing, small pine trees had been planted in neat lines, stretching like vineyard rows up the hill to Vogtle Units 1 and 2. The ground beneath our feet was covered in a carpet of fallen needles. It's all part of the effort to preserve the area as a pristine environment, Daniel explained to me: ''We're trying to return the area to how it looked before we built here.''
 Much of this will be swept away, though, if plans progress the way the Southern Company hopes. In the clearing, some engineers at Vogtle had painted a green circle, about 60 feet in diameter, to mark the location and size of the planned reactor building. And in the center of the circle was a pole, also painted green, to mark the hot reactor core. This would be Vogtle Unit 3, Daniel said. Not far off, perhaps a few hundred yards, was another pole and another green circle. If you can imagine it, he added, this would be Vogtle Unit 4.

Hard Times After T.M.I.
 On the evening before my visit to Vogtle, the prospect of new reactors at the site was the subject of a public meeting, convened by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at a technical college in Waynesboro, Ga., a small town about 30 minutes from the plant. Anyone intrigued or appalled by the idea of new construction could come to ask questions. These kinds of community gatherings have become a frequent occurrence around the country over the past year as utilities have shown a renewed interest in building reactors. ''We're in what's called the preapplication space for Plant Vogtle,'' David Matthews, the head of new-reactor licensing at the N.R.C., told me as people milled about before the evening meeting. Matthews brought a dozen colleagues with him -- engineers and science advisers, mainly -- to address any technical points that might arise after he made a few brief remarks explaining the N.R.C. licensing process. But some attendees had come not so much to ask questions as to encourage the Southern Company to build Units 3 and 4. ''Can you do it any quicker?'' asked one representative from the local chamber of commerce. Meanwhile, a number of antinuclear advocates wanted to quiz the commission officials about the possible hazards of a new plant design and the plant's radioactive (and highly toxic) spent fuel; some had even set up tables to distribute brochures alongside the agency's own informational pamphlets. The rancorous debates that defined these sorts of public meetings two decades ago were largely absent: the exchanges followed a protocol that kept tempers in check while lending the meeting a formality that N.R.C. representatives, all dressed in formal business attire, tried to promote. Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were serious business.
 The received wisdom about the United States nuclear industry is that it began a long and inexorable decline immediately after the near meltdown, in 1979, at Three Mile Island in central Pennsylvania, an accident that -- in one of those rare alignments of Hollywood fantasy and real-world events -- was preceded by the release of the film ''The China Syndrome'' two weeks earlier. To be sure, the events at T.M.I., as those in the industry invariably refer to it, as well as the radioactive steam explosion at Chernobyl seven years later, galvanized public opinion against nuclear power as never before. In the case of Long Island's Shoreham plant, steadfast community opposition eventually stopped a newly finished plant from ever operating. But the fortunes of the nuclear business have been defined by many factors that aren't so conspicuous. Several years before T.M.I., the growing expense of new nuclear projects, coupled with the realization that many predictions for future electricity demand were overblown, had already hobbled the business. New orders for plants had fallen off drastically by 1978. ''The industry was in a depressed state,'' says J. Samuel Walker, the historian at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ''And what T.M.I. did was finish things off.''
 In fact, T.M.I. didn't kill the industry. It killed the growth of the industry -- ensuring, in a way, that nuclear power would not assume more than a fraction of the U.S. electric business. The last year a plant was approved for construction by the N.R.C. was 1978. But interminable construction schedules meant that many facilities approved before T.M.I., like Plant Vogtle in Georgia, were finished long after the accident. Some didn't even start generating power until a few years ago; the last was the Watts Bar plant in eastern Tennessee, which began operations in 1996. Since then the contribution of nuclear energy to our electrical grid has remained fairly steady. All told, the 103 active nuclear reactors in the United States supply about 20 percent of our electricity. And in some places the contribution is much larger. New York gets 29 percent of its power from nuclear energy, New Jersey 52 percent. Abroad, nuclear energy has its hot spots too -- in France, for instance, 78 percent of the electricity comes from nuclear energy. There are currently 337 working reactors in 30 countries outside the United States, and there may soon be many more, as India and China embark upon ambitious plans to build dozens over the next decade to satisfy their thirst for electricity.
 In the U.S., each of the commercial nuclear plants has been granted a 40-year operating license by the N.R.C. This life span was originally based upon the hypotheses of engineers and physicists in the early 1960's who weren't sure how long a large nuclear plant could safely operate, because none had ever been built before. While there have been numerous incidents of mechanical defects over the past few decades, the 40-year projection has by and large proved a conservative estimate, and in the past few years, the N.R.C. has been granting 20-year extensions so that some older plants that pass workplace inspections can run for a total of 60 years. Even with such licensing renewals, though, it's doubtful the current fleet of plants will run for, say, 80 years. When I visited Nils Diaz, the longtime chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who retired at the end of June, he pointed out that even if one passed muster for safety, a plant that old might require so much upkeep as to make it uneconomical.
 That means the industry, in a way, is in a race against time. Recently, Paul Joskow, a professor of economics at M.I.T., sent me a chart that looks ahead to the output of America's reactors over the next half-century. As the current 103 nuclear reactors continue to generate electricity for the next few decades, the line on the chart remains mostly flat. But then the plants' electricity production falls off a cliff. ''I think this is the first time in many years, perhaps 20 years, that the combination of government policy, economic conditions and environmental constraints are reasonably favorable for nuclear,'' Joskow told me. ''If they can't move forward now, it would be very difficult in the longer run.'' It may even be more urgent than that. One conclusion to be derived from the chart is that nuclear power in this country is dying. Unless someone starts building soon, it will begin to disappear in 15 or 20 years, as one plant after another exhausts its operating permit and goes dark. And it will effectively be extinguished as an energy source by around 2050.
 For those with deep misgivings about the safety and expense of nuclear plants, life without them may indeed be a cause for celebration. Yet their absence would probably pose tremendous challenges for the United States. The first is where 20 percent of our power would come from; the second is whether a substitute fuel for that power would emit carbon dioxide. It is, in many ways, a long-term dilemma, one closely related to global warming, and one that is poorly suited to a society that focuses on short-term results. For Wall Street, which concerns itself with our publicly traded utilities' quarterly earnings, the primary worry is whether companies (and investors) that choose nuclear power will quickly be saddled with burdensome debts. For elected officials, the main concern is whether support for nuclear energy will hurt or help their standing in the next election cycle. Yet to spend a few months listening to those who study the earth's energy resources is to get the feeling that we are in for a very difficult century -- and one that depends on an immediate future of difficult and unpleasant choices. ''If you want a different energy system in 2050, you really have to start changing it now,'' says John Holdren, a Harvard professor and one of the country's most esteemed thinkers on energy and the environment. ''You can't get there and say, 'Oh, I want a different energy system.' ''

Pick Your Poison
 When it comes to America's future energy needs, one of the larger points of confusion is the somewhat tangled relationship between fossil fuels and electricity. Current prices at the gas pump, for instance, or the possibility that we are approaching a moment of ''peak oil'' -- the point at which the global supply of crude peaks and then diminishes forever, with cataclysmic consequences for transportation, trucking and the economy in general -- actually have little to do with the future supply of power. Making electricity is generally about creating a source of heat and steam, and using that steam to turn giant turbines and generate power. Less than 3 percent of our electric power is generated from oil. Besides the 20 percent contribution from nuclear power, 50 percent of our electricity comes from burning coal, 18 percent from burning natural gas and (in a heat-free method that is often the cheapest) 6.5 percent by harnessing the energy of water moving through dams. Wind and solar power make up less than one-half of 1 percent of what we use on a typical day. In part because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine (and in part because wind turbines and solar cells are expensive to build) neither technology is yet good enough to generate large, reliable quantities of inexpensive electricity, or what utility companies call ''base load'' power. At at some point in the future, oil and electricity may fight for supremacy: Toyota recently announced it is developing a plug-in car in addition to its hybrids, for instance, and electricity has the potential to help manufacture clean-burning fuels like hydrogen for the future. 
 Over the past few years, the executives at Georgia Power, a division of the Southern Company as well as the utility that owns the majority share of the Vogtle plant, have tracked the population growth of the region and tried to look ahead, as all utilities do, at what the demand for electricity might be several decades from now. At the moment, the company's 20-year projections suggest that power needs in the region will grow by 30 percent. So that's one consideration. Another is that some outmoded plants in their system will need to be replaced. Building Vogtle Units 3 and 4 would, essentially, be a bet that a nuclear power plant will be superior to a new coal or gas plant in the long run. ''I think based on what we know today, it would be the best option, but there's still a lot of work to be done,'' Oscar Harper, a vice president at Georgia Power, told me. Yet even if Georgia Power makes a decision in favor of nuclear, it still needs the state's public utility board to agree that it's in the best interest of Georgia residents.
 None of this is assured. Moreover, what makes the choice of fuels such a knotty problem is that something that is cheap now, like coal, may not be so cheap in 10 years. This isn't because we're running out; we probably have at least a century's worth of coal reserves in the United States alone. But if the government were to impose a tax or a cap on carbon emissions, something that almost everyone I spoke with in the energy industry believes is inevitable, or if new laws mandate that coal plants must adopt more expensive technologies to burn the coal cleaner -- or to ''sequester'' the carbon-dioxide byproducts underground -- the financial equation will change: a kilowatt-hour generated by coal suddenly becomes more expensive. There are other contingencies at play, too: fuels, like natural gas, could experience a supply interruption that leads to enormous price spikes. As for the hope that wind and solar power will generate large amounts of clean, affordable electricity in the near future? I encountered great skepticism inside and outside the utility companies. ''Maybe in 40 years,'' Paul Joskow, of M.I.T., told me.
 Meanwhile, nuclear power has several appealing factors: the cost of uranium is fairly low, the supply is abundant (and mostly found in countries friendly to the United States) and big plants like Vogtle can generate large amounts of inexpensive electricity. The fuel, which takes the shape of thousands of pellets that are loaded inside long metal tubes and then placed into the reactor core, is strikingly potent; just a few pellets stacked together to resemble the size, shape and color of a black crayon can generate enough electricity for an entire family for a year. On the other hand, the list of negatives is long. Uranium mining is a messy business, and some Western states are still cleaning up the detritus of mines and mills from a half-century ago. A catastrophic reactor accident here or abroad -- one that could be the equivalent of a so-called dirty bomb, killing thousands and rendering hundreds of square miles of surrounding land uninhabitable -- would immediately destroy any revival of the industry. Then there are byproducts and proliferation. Until the Yucca Mountain underground repository in Nevada is completed (and the site probably will not be approved for construction before 2011), spent fuel has to stay on the site of nuclear facilities. And the possibility of irradiated fuel in the hands of a terrorist or rogue government has become increasingly worrisome in recent years.
 The most immediate challenges, at least for the utilities, are the capital costs of building new plants, which when factored into the cost of the electricity, as they need to be, have a history of striking terror into the hearts of public-utility board members. A coal plant costs significantly less than a nuclear plant -- as much as 50 percent less -- and a gas plant is much cheaper than a coal plant. When I asked David Ratcliffe, the C.E.O. of the Southern Company, about the choice he's facing at Vogtle, he explained: ''When you line up the three fundamental technologies -- gas, coal and nuclear -- you're lining them up from lowest capital cost and lowest construction time to greatest capital cost and greatest construction time. You're also lining them up from greatest fuel-price volatility to least fuel-price volatility.'' Probably the best comparison of gas, coal and nuclear energy was done with Joskow's help in 2003, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published an exhaustive analysis of the future of nuclear power. The M.I.T. study concluded that nuclear energy is competitive, but only under certain circumstances. One instance is if the costs of building a plant are significantly reduced (by shortening the length of construction, for example). Another is if coal and natural-gas plants are taxed on carbon emissions. Because nuclear plants don't produce carbon dioxide and wouldn't be taxed, their electricity could conceivably cost no more to generate than that from coal and gas, or even less.
 There is a counterargument to building large new power plants. One view -- voiced most forcefully, perhaps, by Amory Lovins, a physicist who runs Rocky Mountain Institute, which advises corporations and utilities on energy efficiency -- is that we don't need to increase our electrical supply. We need to decrease demand by rewarding utilities for getting customers to reduce electricity use by, say, updating their appliances, furnaces and lighting. Lovins, a longtime critic of nuclear power, contends that it remains financially uncompetitive and that the 30-year absence of new plants is proof that the market has rejected nuclear power as a viable technology. When we spoke about whether utilities need to build more big generating plants in this country, he told me no -- not now, not in 15 years, not even after that. ''I think if you do,'' he remarked, ''your shareholders and ratepayers will be asking awkward questions that you would really rather not want to answer.'' Yet the concern, even among Lovins's admirers, is that if he is mistaken -- that is, if either his estimates on efficiencies can't accommodate population and industrial growth, or because what is possible in principle for energy efficiency is not possible in the real world -- then the utilities will require an alternative plan. And that would entail more supply, likely meaning more big base-load plants (whether they rely on uranium, gas or coal) as well as large investments in renewable sources like wind and solar power.
 When I asked John Holdren at Harvard whether the potential for efficiencies is as large as Lovins says, he replied, ''The savings could be huge.'' Yet Holdren also maintains that creating a clean and reliable energy supply for the future is going to be so daunting that nothing should be taken off the table. Clean coal, renewables, nuclear -- we'll need them all. To those in the electricity business, this is known as creating an energy portfolio: build everything, use everything and rely on nothing exclusively. ''I'll be very happy if Amory's right,'' Holdren added, ''but I'd like to hedge my bets.''
 For 30 years the debate has been defined by a perfect and almost maddening symmetry, not only in terms of opinion but also of facts. The answer to whether nuclear power is risky can be framed many ways, for instance: you can tally the number of injuries and deaths to citizens from U.S. nuclear plants (zero) or consider the potential number of injuries and deaths in a serious accident (many). Is nuclear power clean because it doesn't produce carbon? Or is it dirty because it produces radioactive waste? Is it very expensive? Or are the economics competitive over the long run, especially if fossil fuels are taxed for warming the planet?

The AP1000, the Latest Thing in Plant Designs
 For a utility that wants to go shopping for a nuclear plant, there are no blueprints floating around to help you do it yourself. If you have access to $2 billion or $3 billion, you pretty much have only three options. You can begin negotiations with General Electric or a French company called Areva for their newest designs, known as the E.S.B.W.R. and the E.P.R., respectively. Or you can start talking with Westinghouse, as the Southern Company has done, and check out its new reactor, the AP1000. If the Southern Company's Georgia Power division decides to build Vogtle Units 3 and 4, this is the model. Unlike G.E.'s and Areva's models, the Westinghouse design was approved and certified this year, after a complex multiyear process, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Still, as I was reminded during my tour of Vogtle, an AP1000 has never been built anywhere in the world.
 Westinghouse's offices are about 30 minutes outside Pittsburgh, in a complex of squat, black, glassy modernist boxes that seem to have been dropped gently from the heavens onto a campus of several hundred verdant acres. The company continues to license its all-American name for home appliances, and its switchboard still gets calls every December from homeowners having trouble with their old Westinghouse Christmas lights. But this is now a nuclear company, and a nuclear company only, from top to bottom: Westinghouse services existing plants, sells fuel and sells new plant designs. All its other divisions have been shed, most of them during a corporate fire sale in the 1990's. ''At that point in time, we didn't anticipate nuclear coming back here in the U.S.,'' Steve Tritch, the company's C.E.O., told me when I met with him in his office. So Westinghouse looked to Europe and Asia for new plants and concentrated on selling fuel and consulting services. ''Barring some tremendous technological discovery that was going to produce energy, my own personal belief was that if you looked at the basic situation with fossil fuels, then nuclear was going to be used again here,'' Tritch said. Still, in those days he assumed that Westinghouse wouldn't see much new business in the U.S. until perhaps 2015.
 About two-thirds of the plants in the United States are based on Westinghouse designs, including Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and the first commercial reactor ever built in this country, in Shippingport, Pa., which began producing power in 1957. In the mid-1950's, the Atomic Energy Commission, the forerunner of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, allowed the development of nuclear power for civilian uses. The fuel was to be far less volatile than that used in a weapon, which is why a nuclear plant can't be detonated like an atomic bomb. Yet it took at least another decade before the industry gained any traction, and much of the early momentum came from government financing and the willingness of companies like G.E. and Westinghouse to sell plants for tremendous discounts. Many utilities couldn't resist. In the early years, most of the engineers who designed plants came out of the U.S. Navy program for nuclear submarines, which explains the industry preference for nautical terminology (the ''fleet'') and to some extent its nautical design motifs. Walking through the industrial interiors of Plant Vogtle and of Grand Gulf, a nuclear plant I visited in Mississippi, I had the odd sensation of being in the hold of an immense freighter, bound for somewhere.
 In retrospect, the nuclear dream of the 1950's and 60's was at least partly delusional. Those infamous predictions from the early days -- that nuclear power would be ''too cheap to meter,'' as Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, told a conference of science writers in 1954, or that the country was destined to have the nuclear power of 1,000 plants by the year 2000, as the commission predicted in the early 1970's -- seem farcical in light of what transpired in building the plants: the billions in overruns, the endless years of construction. Steve Tritch told me that inside the Westinghouse offices in the 1980's, executives kept a list of domestic plants they expected would be decommissioned even before their 40-year licenses expired. The trend for utilities was to get out of nuclear power as fast as possible, not in.
 The so-called renaissance may turn out to be just a brief flurry of enthusiasm, entailing the construction of a few new plants over the next decade. But if nuclear power does catch on again -- and there are a number of reasons to think it might, the most obvious being strong government encouragement driven by the attitude that a portfolio of energy options creates a more stable economy -- then the seeds of its revival would almost certainly date back to the late 1980's and early 1990's. At that point, it was clear that the industry had massive, intractable problems. Most of the plants in the country were of customized designs, making repairs difficult and efficiencies of scale challenging. Many utilities had no expertise in operating a nuclear plant even after purchasing one. Meanwhile, the process for getting a facility approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was done in two steps: first a construction permit and then, years later, an operating permit. The process all but ensured long delays and wasted resources as N.R.C. regulators identified construction errors and design shortcomings at very late stages and as legal opponents challenged the licensing process over the course of many years.
 At around that time, a number of nuclear-friendly groups focused on hammering out a strategic long-term recovery plan for the industry. One of these, the Nuclear Power Oversight Committee, made up of several utility executives, created a blueprint for an industry revival that bears an uncanny resemblance to the way things are turning out today. ''They said you have to have a new licensing regime at the N.R.C., because we can never have a Shoreham again,'' Ed Cummins, Westinghouse's chief engineer, told me. Shoreham, estimated to cost about $260 million in the 1960's, before construction started, was completed in 1984 for $5.5 billion, sold to New York State for $1 in 1992 and immediately decommissioned. Cummins also recalled that the oversight-committee plan listed about 15 other industry and regulatory changes before anyone would again consider building new nuclear plants. Many of the resolutions involved safety features and maintenance. If nuclear power were to ever get another chance, a new fleet of plants had to be standardized in design, easier to build and simpler to maintain. Above all, of course, they had to be far, far less expensive.

The Business of Nuclear Power
 No two factors have been quite so important to the revived prospects for nuclear power as the high price of natural gas and large incentives offered by the Department of Energy, amounting to several hundred million dollars, to help finance the first few reactors. But there have been a great number of helpful factors inside the industry too. By the late 1990's, for instance, several utilities, notably Exelon (based in Illinois) and Entergy Nuclear (Mississippi), had developed specialties in buying and operating nuclear plants. With Westinghouse's help, the companies proved that refueling the plants, a complex choreography that occurs every 18 months or so and results in the temporary shutdown of the plant, could be done in about 35 days rather than the customary 60 or 70. The profits in decreasing that refueling period (many nuclear plants take in revenue of about $1 million a day) have been tremendous. Indeed, the companies became so adept at refueling and day-to-day operations that they began acquiring old nuclear plants whose owners either didn't want them or couldn't manage them. And they have proved that building a nuclear plant and buying a nuclear plant are entirely different business propositions. A company like Entergy, for instance, has purchased plants like Indian Point in Westchester County and Pilgrim in Massachusetts, updated them, retrained the work force, sped up the refueling process and reaped a nice financial reward. When I traveled to Jackson, Miss., to meet with Entergy's executives, its C.E.O., Gary Taylor, pointed out that the company's fleet, which now numbers 10 reactors, accounts for about $250 million in annual profits. What's more, it has been companies like Entergy and Exelon that in the 1990's began to give the engineers at Westinghouse and G.E. suggestions for the next generation of nuclear facilities, if they were ever built, rather than the other way around. According to Tritch, the Westinghouse C.E.O., company executives had to listen. ''They had been operating plants for 25 years,'' he says. ''It was no longer a core competency of ours. It was a core competency of theirs.''
 One great challenge in designing nuclear power plants is that making something safer and making something cheaper are often conflicting priorities: the less you spend, the less safe it is, and vice versa. This was what Westinghouse engineers began to wrestle with as they explored designs that could be built more efficiently. For any new project, the same basic technology would still be used to produce electricity: uranium pellets, encased in fuel rods, would undergo a controlled chain reaction in the core, release energy to heat pressurized water and generate steam, and the steam would turn giant, magnetized turbines to generate electricity. But they theorized that if the plant was physically smaller and it used less in the way of materials, it would help reduce costs and construction time. Also, a cheaper plant could be built off site from poured concrete modules and assembled on location, rather than through a huge works project on the scale of the Great Pyramids, as at Vogtle. Most important, perhaps, the engineers began to ponder what's known as ''passive'' safety features. Years before, the U.S. military had asked Westinghouse to design a small, underground nuclear reactor to power missile silos. The reactor was never built, according to Howard Bruschi, the company's former chief technology officer, but the lessons were not forgotten. Passive safety measures included backup systems that would kick in automatically in the event of accidents or mechanical problems. Hundreds or thousands of working pipes and valves might be replaced by, say, a tank of cooling water mounted high so it could be emptied by gravity rather than by an electric pump. Complexity reduced, money saved. And at least in theory, there was an improvement in safety, too. The company's project was given a name: the AP600. It stood for Advanced Passive reactor; the 600 represented the output in megawatts.
 Westinghouse financed part of the AP600 effort through its research budget, and the company also received a generous grant in the early 1990's from the U.S. Department of Energy. But even those sources of money weren't enough to supply the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to create the large working models to test the efficacy of the safety systems. ''So we basically went to other countries that had nuclear programs and invited them to help with their test facilities and engineers,'' Bruschi says. Within Westinghouse, I heard it said that Bruschi went around the world, hat in hand, looking for help. I asked him how many countries he visited. ''Italy, France, Japan, England, Scotland, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, Latvia and Poland,'' he told me. Eventually he went to China and Indonesia, too. It paid off when the N.R.C. approved the design for the AP600 in 1999.
 But there were no buyers. Not one. Ed Cummins, the Westinghouse engineer, says that one major utility executive set him straight on why. Any utility could build a gas plant for far cheaper, he was told, and sell the electricity at a lower rate. So why build this? The AP600 was too small. It generated too little electricity to justify its construction costs. ''He was right,'' Cummins says, and in response, he and his staff spent several years expanding the AP600 into the 1,100-megawatt AP1000. It cost more, but its larger electric output made it more competitive. When I visited Westinghouse in late May, the company was just putting the finishing touches on a simulated control room for the new plant, a sleek space near Cummins's office to demonstrate for buyers and regulators how operators will monitor the plant on just a few computer terminals and one large, central screen. Unlike the control rooms I visited at Vogtle and Grand Gulf, where operators are in charge of literally thousands of buttons, switches and meters, the technology at the AP1000 simulator, like the aesthetic, is modernized, simplified and streamlined.
 The look is part of the marketing effort, of course. But the appeal of the AP1000 remains doubtful, even as 11 utilities, including the Southern Company, have expressed interest in the design. Westinghouse maintained to me that the cost will ultimately be somewhere between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion. ''We're negotiating contracts,'' Dan Lipman, who runs the new-power-plant division at Westinghouse, told me over lunch at the company cafeteria. ''We're well beyond the should-we-do-nuclear phase. It's now a matter of, How should we do it?'' So I asked Lipman what it would mean to actually cut a deal with a utility for a new plant, the first in 30 years. Would it happen a year from now? Two years? ''If your definition of a deal is, when do you first start getting money, then that could happen very soon,'' he said. ''I look for that this year, with big money committed after licensing by the N.R.C.'' From his continuing negotiations, Lipman said, it's clear that his customers are interested in ''off-ramps'': clauses in the contracts that allow them to bow out if they hit an unexpected financial or construction snag.
 Still, if there is some circumstantial evidence that the price of new plants hasn't hit the point of affordability -- the on-ramp, essentially, where utilities stop negotiating and start signing contracts and building -- it might be the decision by the Tennessee Valley Authority to refurbish an existing nuclear facility at Browns Ferry in Alabama, rather than sign a contract for a new one. ''The fact that the T.V.A. is spending $1.8 billion to fix up an old plant, rather than just spend it on a new plant, suggests that a new one costs well over $2 billion,'' David Lochbaum, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, told me in Washington. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and former consultant in the industry, agrees that carbon taxes could make a new nuclear plant financially viable. For now he says that the AP1000 just costs too much. This is something Westinghouse will not concede, but company executives did say they are fully aware that it isn't passive safety or modular construction that will sell their designs. It's the price tag, as well as proof that for the first time in history, a slew of nuclear plants can be built quickly, smoothly and within a budget.

Achieving Critical Mass
 What really keeps the utilities and the nuclear industry up at night is risk -- not just the risk that something will break down at one of the existing plants and thus wipe out two decades of improvements in operations, but the risk that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is a black hole, an organization that will accept the new applications for plants and wait (and wait) before approving a construction-and-operating license. The N.R.C., which has streamlined its review process since the debacles of the 1970's, fields criticisms from both sides. Nuclear-safety advocates like Lochbaum, at the Union of Concerned Scientists, find it too accommodating to the industry; the industry, in turn, finds it too tough, slow and bureaucratic. But no one denies that the agency holds extraordinary power over the fate of the nuclear business in this country. It can shut a facility down, levy fines of $130,000 per incident per day, bar employees from working in the industry and delay and deny licenses. In addition to several thousand employees in its Rockville, Md., offices, the agency places at least two N.R.C. employees at every plant in the country. (They have total access at every plant to review day-to-day operations.) The agency is not known for partisanship; the commission membership is split in party affiliation, and the employees are civil servants. If anything, the engineers I met at the N.R.C. are a kind of hybrid scientist-cop, people of formidable intelligence with very little patience for companies or plants that deviate from the letter of the law.
 Nuclear power plants are arguably the most complicated machines in the history of civilization, and the review process for new plants reflects that complexity. Essentially, a utility will need three stamps of approval from the N.R.C. to build a new facility: a site permit, an approved reactor design and a construction-and-operating license. Only then can a utility move forward. In the case of Vogtle, the Southern Company is finishing a site-permit application this month that will explore the suitability of those green circles on the forest floor as future reactor sites. The application will run thousands of pages and include an array of scientific data -- ''seismology, meteorology, hydrology, just about all the ologies I can list for you,'' says David Matthews, the head of the reactor-licensing division at the N.R.C. The agency, in turn, will spend two to three years reviewing it. The Southern Company has already said it would use the AP1000, meaning that it has chosen a certified design. So an approval of the site should eventually lead to the next step: a construction-and-operating application that includes detailed engineering data and every possible risk assessment. It will probably run more than 30,000 pages. It will take the N.R.C. at least another three years to review it. The question of whether various utilities are serious about reviving nuclear power might be measured by their seriousness in pursuing such an involved process. They're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to have the chance to build a nuclear plant within a few years. Just for the option of building Vogtle Units 3 and 4 -- not for any construction at all -- Georgia Power expects to spend $51 million. As David Ratcliffe, the Southern Company's C.E.O., put it: ''We're marching down this road.''
 I asked many people in the industry whether the N.R.C. can grant licenses with the kind of speed that would preserve the integrity of its safety reviews and still satisfy the utilities. Nils Diaz, the recently retired chairman of the commission, told me that with new management procedures and employees -- the N.R.C. is hiring hundreds of scientists and engineers to ready itself for the blizzard of work -- the agency is up to the task. But most of the utilities, and many financial analysts who cover the electricity business, maintain a more guarded attitude. In fact, the industry has tried to create several cushions to insulate itself from potential hang-ups, since a delay doesn't mean only that it will take longer for a plant to produce revenue but also that a utility will have to pay interest on any money it borrows to finance a plant. (At Vogtle, for instance, nearly $3 billion of the final $8.87 billion cost was the finance charge on debt.) For starters, the Department of Energy has created a kind of risk insurance available to utilities that are the first movers in building a new plant. If one of the new plants hits regulatory delays during construction, the D.O.E. will reimburse the utility for at least a part of those costs.
 The second cushion is the creation of an industry consortium, called NuStart, to test the licensing process. NuStart is filing several applications for nuclear plants, on behalf of its members, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These applications -- for the Grand Gulf plant in Mississippi and the Bellefonte site in Alabama -- have preceded all others and may end up being built first. One goal of NuStart is to prove to Wall Street that utilities can get a license in a timely manner. Another goal is to establish a way for the industry to pool risk and information. If NuStart's construction-and-operating applications for its two sites are approved, in other words, any utility in the consortium (including Entergy, Exelon and Southern Company) can copy huge parts of the approved application for its own use, thus saving time and money. The Southern Company would do this for Vogtle.
 The hypothetical nuclear plant then hits the next set of obstacles. In the South, at least, there appears to be little in the way of community opposition. When I spent the day in Port Gibson, Miss., the tiny town next to the Grand Gulf plant, the local politicians were adamant in support of any new reactor. ''We've not been able to prosper like other communities,'' James Miller, the country administrator, told me. ''We see this as our golden opportunity.'' The industry seems more concerned about the logistics of building a plant -- that is, the actual construction. Several executives told me that they worried most about finding enough craft labor to work on the special aspects of plant construction. They also worried about steel orders, since the domestic industry that long ago forged the massive reactor vessels no longer exists. Only Japan Steel Works, these executives say, has such capacity now. ''This country hasn't built really a lot of whole infrastructure in 20 years, and it hasn't licensed a new nuclear plant in 30 years,'' Gary Taylor, the Entergy Nuclear C.E.O., told me. ''Most of the hard manufacturing moved offshore. In many ways that may be a bigger challenge than anything else.''
 Then there's the question of safety. The performance of American plants in this regard has improved markedly over the past 10 years; the industry, moreover, has gone to great lengths to help operators at plants around the world share information on mechanical or safety issues. Yet the specter of an accident has never really disappeared -- nor will it. Nils Diaz told me that the role of the National Regulatory Commission is not to regulate the industry to a ''zero-risk factor.'' That would be impossible, he said. It's to make sure there is the ''reasonable assurance of adequate protection.'' Many industry critics wonder if even this goal is achievable. David Lochbaum, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, has pointed out the existence of a ''bathtub curve'' that applies to the safety of nuclear plants: statistically, they are most dangerous either when they are first brought online (as was the case with T.M.I. and Chernobyl) or at the very end of their life cycles. Many of our existing plants, Lochbaum points out, are edging closer to old age. As for the next generation of plants, the risk assessments on the AP1000 suggest its design is between 10 and 100 times safer than existing models. But until one is actually built, this remains a hypothetical. Engineers at the N.R.C. told me they will retain a healthy skepticism for passive safety until there's a track record in a working plant. They also noted, as a separate concern, that design safety (in any plant) does not necessarily translate into operational safety. ''It's difficult to model and predict human action,'' Jerry Wilson, an N.R.C. analyst, told me. ''It's much easier to model the technical details.''
 Finally, what about a wild card -- that is, the remote possibility of an attack on a plant? It is not easy to get into a nuclear facility these days. It took me several weeks just to gain access to report this article, and I was first subjected to a thorough background check. At the gates of both Vogtle and Grand Gulf, I was met by heavily armed guards; later, I was escorted through many phalanxes of protective structures -- razor wire, concrete blocks, fences, steel turnstiles, security doors, explosives sensors and so on -- before ever getting near the reactor. At Grand Gulf, guards even patrolled inside key buildings with AR-15 semiautomatic rifles. Walking unescorted was out of the question. At least from the ground, the plants seemed impregnable. And the reactor-containment buildings, where the core resides -- the small domed buildings that are the heart of a nuclear plant (the high cooling towers carry no radioactivity) -- are some of the strongest man-made structures in existence. They're engineered to withstand earthquakes, fires, floods, internal explosions.
 Yet the details of the N.R.C.'s own security reviews of plants (the agency periodically stages ''force on force'' mock attacks) have not been made public since 9/11 for reasons of national security, so there is no way to know how some facilities, if any, are deficient in protective measures. In 2000 and 2001, the last set of statistics the N.R.C. made public, 6 of 11 plants that were tested failed to prevent reactor damage when defending against the simulated attacks.

A Different Sort of Wedge Issue
 To John Holdren of Harvard, the essential problem with nuclear power is that it is ''too unforgiving of either human error or human malice.'' At the same time, Holdren points out, every source of electricity has its negatives. In the case of oil and gas, the question is whether there are enough reserves. For other fossil fuels like coal and tar sands, the question is whether our atmosphere can tolerate the emissions. For ethanol, the question is whether there is enough land to grow the necessary crops. For wind and hydropower, the question is whether there are enough good sites. Enough sunlight hits the planet to power civilization 2,000 times over, Holdren says, but solar power from photovoltaic cells is too expensive. ''I can design a world that runs on photovoltaics,'' he says, ''but at current costs, electricity would be three or four times what it costs today.'' That would wreak havoc on the world economy. 
 What complicates things further is the specter of great climate changes. This month, Jim Hansen, a NASA scientist, declared that we have, at most, 10 years to alter the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions. Holdren, similarly, says he believes that the problems from global warming could become so acute so quickly -- as in a few years, rather than a few decades -- that there really isn't much time to decide which way to go.
 Among the most influential ideas these days about how to change the system are those from the research of two Princeton professors, Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow, who wrote an academic paper in 2004 on what they called ''stabilization wedges.'' It is an encouraging document, in that it presents a manageable way to think about how to address global warming -- basically, to approach it on many fronts simultaneously -- without suggesting we need one big, magical fix. Pacala and Socolow looked at what we can do now, using current technologies, and barring any sort of startling new scientific developments, to freeze carbon dioxide production and thus slow down global warming. They assert that we could reduce carbon emissions incrementally. In pursuing one of these ''wedges,'' we would reduce carbon emissions slightly; but in pursuing all of them, we could succeed in flatlining the growth of carbon emissions entirely by the century's midpoint.
 There are 15 different wedges. These include increasing vehicle efficiency, reforestation, improving the efficiency of buildings, capturing carbon in power plants, replacing some coal power with wind power and replacing some coal power with solar power. Nuclear power is a wedge, too. It is curious, though perhaps unsurprising, that to various advocates some wedges have proved more appealing than others: supporters of nuclear power, for instance, stressed its environmental wedge potential to me while playing down the viability of wind and solar power. The opposite is true as well. In the film ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' Al Gore refers to the Pacala and Socolow research, citing several wedges, but not the nuclear one. He stresses renewable energies.
 To consider nuclear energy in the environmental framework, though, may be the same as asking whether the utilities that pursue new plants might be giving us a valuable wedge. Because without the environmental contribution from new nuclear plants, we may need to find a wedge somewhere else. And ultimately, the essential, agonizingly difficult question of nuclear power is not whether it's good or bad, or whether it's worse than wind and better than coal, but whether we will have a better future with or without it. ''By 2015, I think everyone in the world will be convinced that our interventions in climate are going to be intolerable,'' Holdren says. ''I'm often asked, 'Can you solve the climate problem without nuclear energy?' And I say, 'Yes, you can solve it without nuclear energy.' But it will be easier to solve it with nuclear energy.'' Of course, that does not necessarily address the questions of plant security, proliferation and operational safety. Or economics. But it does suggest, as the M.I.T. economist Paul Joskow told me, that ''there is a value'' in the development of at least a few new plants and in keeping the nuclear option alive. This line of thinking might ultimately bring you to a cautious support for nuclear power simply because allowing it to die seems more dangerous than keeping it alive. You are against its demise, rather than for its advancement.
 There are many in the nuclear industry, meanwhile, with far grander visions. Gary Taylor, for instance, the C.E.O. of Entergy Nuclear, says he believes a doubling of the number of nuclear plants around the world is inevitable, both to satisfy energy demands and to counter global warming. As Taylor puts it: ''The reality is, what is scalable in the time frame that addresses the issues? If it isn't this technology, I don't know what it would be.'' Diaz, the former head of the N.R.C., told me he sees a similarly bright future for nuclear. ''The world is going to go nuclear, because they do not have any other real alternatives,'' he says. I met plenty of other engineers within the industry who went even further. Their feeling about nuclear power is close to evangelical, in that they seem to approach the technology with moral certitude while being loath to acknowledge any of its many negatives. Would that include the utility executives who will ultimately decide if -- and what -- to build? I'm not sure it would. To those I spoke with in the uppermost ranks, nuclear power isn't a belief system. It's a business. And to them, what might come out of, say, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 -- the waste and the power and the profits -- would be nearly identical to what comes out of Units 1 and 2.
 At least that was my conclusion in Georgia, where Jeff Gasser, the Southern Company's chief nuclear officer, took me through a long tour of the plant. He was smart, meticulous and intensely committed to the obscure safety protocols that go on at nuclear power facilities. Most of all he was forthright about the advantages and disadvantages of the nukes business. When we went to visit the spent-fuel pool in Vogtle, where the used fuel-rod assemblies are stored under 20 feet of protective water, Gasser let me know that we would die if we pulled one of the fuel assemblies out of the pool. ''We would receive, before we could get to the exit door a few feet away, a lethal radiation dose,'' he said. I quickly had to check the radiation dosimeter I was wearing -- another legal requirement of the N.R.C. -- to see if I was already glowing. (It read zero.) ''The communications people hate it when I use words like 'lethal' and 'irradiated,' '' Gasser continued. ''But the fact is, there is no perfect way of generating electricity. There are byproducts for every type.'' Like many others, he went through the positives and negatives of coal, gas, solar, wind and nuclear. In his opinion, he added, with Vogtle's engineering, redundancy of safety systems and its trained operators, it was a safe, reliable and efficient way of making electricity. That was his sales pitch.
 We had already passed through the containment buildings, where the reactors heat the pressurized water. So Gasser took me through the turbine building, an enormous room the size of a soccer field, where the steam turns the fan blades. Eventually, we went out a back door into the sunlight. The deafening sounds of turbines and machinery subsided to a dull thrum. We removed our earplugs and walked over to a small forest of electrical transformers, our backs to the plant. The electricity from the turbines inside comes out here, Gasser explained, its voltage is transformed, and it is then put into the grid.
 Gasser made a pushing motion toward the green hills before us.
 ''Once the power is sent out of here, it can go everywhere,'' he explained. And I could see that it did go everywhere. The high-tension wires stretched away from where we stood, in several directions, through deep cuts in the pinelands, as far as I could see.

HEADLINE: Fighting Poverty With $2-a-Day Jobs

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ, a veteran of the Rockefeller Foundation and a former consultant to the World Bank, talks enthusiastically about the development of a company in Africa where some 2,000 women earn, on average, $1.80 a day producing antimalarial bed netting. With the assistance of a $350,000 loan from an American investor, the business started making the nets nearly three years ago and is likely to add 1,000 more jobs within the next year.
 ''They're in the process of building a real company town there,'' Ms. Novogratz said. 
Ms. Novogratz is not an outsourcing executive at a multinational company. Rather, she is the chief executive of the Acumen Fund, a philanthropic start-up based in New York that uses donations to make equity investments and loans in both for-profit and nonprofit companies in impoverished countries. One of the stars of her small portfolio is the bed-netting maker, A to Z Manufacturing, a family-owned company in Tanzania -- a country where 80 percent of the population makes less than $2 a day.
 Social activists have typically railed against large multinationals that have sought the lowest-priced labor they can find in developing countries. But for some members of a new generation of philanthropists, schooled in the techniques of venture capital and Wall Street, fighting poverty effectively relies on the creation of low-wage factories, as well as the establishment of lending institutions that charge rates that many Americans would deem usurious. Rather than work through global aid bureaucracies, they believe that affluent Westerners should become more directly involved in the developing world's credit and labor systems, and invest in and support businesses that are self-sustaining and replicable. 
 ''To put it in the baldest possible terms, the more sweatshops the better,'' said William Easterly, professor of economics at New York University and author of ''The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good.'' Professor Easterly is not advocating the deliberate creation of workplaces with miserable conditions. ''As you increase the number of factories demanding labor, wages will be driven up,'' he said, and eventually such factories will not be sweatshops. 
 Ms. Novogratz says it can be difficult to tell well-off, philanthropy-minded Westerners that what Africa really needs is more $2-a-day jobs. But when they understand the alternatives, she said, such concerns tend to melt away. Before they found work at the netting factory in Tanzania, for example, many of the women were street vendors or domestic workers and earned less than $1 a day. A to Z's wages place the women in Tanzania's top quartile of earners, Ms. Novogratz said. 
 Similar issues hold for the granting of very small loans, often called microlending. ''Microfinance boosts the very best parts of capitalism, because it boosts people's ability to make their own choices and to work their way out of poverty,'' said Roy Jacobowitz, senior vice president for resource development and communications at Accion International, a Boston-based group that has established and supported the creation of a network of microlending banks, mostly in Latin America. 
 The banks, many of which are for-profit companies, lend cash to poor people at annual rates that are higher than 20 percent. But in the markets where Accion's affiliates operate, Mr. Jacobowitz said, borrowers have few options except for money lenders who charge 10 to 20 percent interest per day. 
 Many of the new venture philanthropists do not simply accept systems as they are. Abraham M. George, who immigrated to the United States from India in the late 1960's and built a successful software company, started the George Foundation in 1995 to fight poverty in India. Among the foundation's projects is a commercial banana farm, which employs largely unskilled women from untouchable castes in the rural area near Bangalore, one of India's showpiece technology centers. 
 Mr. George set wages on the farm at about $40 a month, about what the Indian government says is the minimum needed to support a family of four. But he also provides free medical care and sets aside a portion of the farm's profits to allow the women to acquire their own plots of land. ''The total of these benefits is probably three or four times the going wage income they would receive elsewhere.'' Mr. George said. 
 The advocates of venture philanthropy note that a long time ago, the United States was a nation of factory-based company towns, urban sweatshops and lack of access to capital markets. 
 ''The democratization of access to financial services has been an enormous input into the creation of wealth here,'' said Mr. Jacobowitz of Accion. ''We're trying to boost and accelerate that process in the emerging markets.''
 Indeed, the best thing venture philanthropy can do is to create competition for the labor and business of the poor. In 1992, Accion backed the creation of Banco Sol, a for-profit microlender in Bolivia. Then Accion advised bank regulators on how to make it easier for other private finance companies to enter the microlending market. Today, Mr. Jacobowitz says, six regulated finance companies compete for the business of the poor in Bolivia, providing everything from housing loans to consumer credit. (The average loan at Banco Sol is about $2,100.)
 Thanks to the fierce competition, interest rates paid by poor Bolivians have fallen to 22 percent from 80 percent in the 1980's.
 Some experts are not fully convinced that small-scale private-sector efforts can make a significant difference. ''When you look at the extent to which microfinance reaches people, it's a small drop compared to what is needed,'' said Anjini Kochar, senior research scholar and coordinator of the India Program at the Stanford Center for International Development.
 But there is a great deal of ferment in the field, driven by established institutions like Accion and by new ones like the Acumen Fund and the George Foundation. ''The sort of top-down comprehensive attempt to fix everything in society has been a dismal failure as implemented by the big bureaucracies like the World Bank,'' Professor Easterly said. ''And I think it's time to start thinking much more about bottom-up approaches that try to give new opportunities.''

TALKING RIGHT
 How Conservatives Turned Liberalism Into a Tax-Raising, Latte-Drinking, Sushi-Eating, 
 Volvo-Driving, New York Times-Reading, Body-Piercing, Hollywood-Loving, 
 Left-Wing Freak Show.
 By Geoffrey Nunberg.
 264 pp. PublicAffairs. $26.
In some quarters repairing the Democratic Party has taken the place of baseball as the national pastime. All you need to play is, first, an analysis of what the Democrats are doing wrong (which is usually an analysis of what the Republicans are doing right) and, second, a strategy for regaining the political advantage. Most of those who enter this sweepstakes are (relatively) strong on the diagnosis part and woefully weak on the remedy part. Geoffrey Nunberg's ''Talking Right'' is no exception. 
 Nunberg's thesis is that if you want to get people to do certain things -- vote for your candidates, support your policies -- you must first get them ''to talk in certain ways.'' Capture the field of language and the political field will be yours because the words everyone responds to will have the meanings you have conferred on them. Over the past quarter-century, Nunberg says, the Republicans have been so good at this that even those on the left ''can't help using language that embodies the worldview of the right.'' So, for example, if the word ''values'' turns up in a political conversation, it will be understood without reflection to refer to a specific set of stances -- pro-family, pro-American, pro-merit, pro-religion, anti-special-interests, anti-quotas, anti-abortion, anti-gay-marriage, anti-assisted-suicide. 
 Of course these are not the only values, and Democrats are free to argue for an alternative set, but if the contest is between those whose values come to mind immediately with the very mention of the word and those whose values have to be explained --''I'm not against traditional marriage, I'm just for anti-discrimination'' -- the game is over before it begins. ''The left has lost the battle for the language itself,'' Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, declares at the outset. ''The challenge facing liberals and Democrats is to recapture that ordinary language.'' That, he announces, is ''what this book is about.'' 
 Actually, no. What this book is really about is the rueful admiration Nunberg feels for the ability of the political right to appropriate what he (following Richard Rorty) calls the ''final vocabulary'' of American politics. A succession of lively chapters explains how the Republicans turned ''government into a term of abuse''; torpedoed affirmative action by introducing and promoting reverse discrimination; made ''liberal'' into a word of accusation; redefined the middle class so it encompassed everyone from the proprietor of a corner grocery to the president of the United States (all standing in alliance against the effete mob of latte-drinking, Volvo-driving Eastern seaboard snobs); invented a cultural divide that masks the economic divide between the haves and have-nots; narrowed Franklin Roosevelt's four freedoms into the freedom of corporations to do what they like; drove a wedge between ''patriotic'' and ''liberal,'' so that one cannot be said to be both; and, in general, ''radically reconfigured the political landscape'' in ways that even liberals themselves accede to because the right's language is now the default language for everyone.
 On the way to proposing a counterstrategy (it never really arrives), Nunberg pauses to engage in a polite disagreement with his fellow linguist George Lakoff, who has provided a rival account of the conservative ascendancy. Lakoff argues that Republicans have articulated -- first for themselves and then for others -- a conceptual framework that allows them to unite apparently disparate issues in a single coherent worldview. ''As Lakoff tells it,'' Nunberg writes, ''the same principles that lead you to favor the flat tax would lead you to oppose abortion and favor abstinence-only programs.'' But there is a simpler answer to the question of what connections link conservative social and economic views, Nunberg says: ''There aren't any.'' In place of a conceptual unity, there is only a rhetorical unity (Nunberg doesn't use the word, but the entire history of rhetoric from Quintilian to Kenneth Burke stands behind him), a ''hodgepodge of conflicting metaphors, symbols and rules of thumb . . . self-interest and moral principles in different proportions,'' all woven together not in a philosophically consistent framework but in a narrative ''that creates an illusion of coherence.'' 
 Once again, the Republicans have such a narrative -- ''declining patriotism and moral standards, the out-of-touch media and the self-righteous liberal elite . . . minorities demanding special privileges . . . disrespect for religious faith, a swollen government'' -- but ''Democrats and liberals have not offered compelling narratives that could compete'' with it. Eighty pages later he is still saying the same thing. ''The Democrats need a compelling narrative of their own.'' No doubt, but it is a need this book does not supply. What it does supply is the kind of debating point Nunberg correctly dismisses as ineffective. Democrats, he says, should shore up their position on religion not by arguing for secularism but by explaining that secular values protect freedom of religion by not allowing a particular sect to occupy the entire religious space. That's not a bad argument, and it's a familiar one in judicial debates about the First Amendment's religious clause, but it won't fly in the political arena, if only because, as Nunberg says of a feeble Democratic slogan, ''you have to do a little mental stutter step'' to understand it. 
 Nor will you get much political mileage by pointing out, as Nunberg does, that conservative pundits sometimes say journalists are inevitably subjective (when they complain that most mainstream reporters are liberals) while at other times they ridicule postmodernists and left-wing academics who question objectivity and absolute truth. Again, the observation is accurate, but it does no useful polemical work. Instead, it pays still another compliment to the ability of conservatives to play both sides of the discursive street whenever it is to their advantage.
 So a book that promises to teach liberals how to defeat the political right ends up being a paean to its resourcefulness. Cheerleading may be the intention, but resignation, bordering on despair, is finally the effect. The message seems to be, these guys are just too good; there must be something we can do. But all Nunberg can think to do is claim for the left an advantage that is irrelevant to his book's project: ''Liberals have a linguistic advantage of their own, in the form of truth.'' That is to say (and he says it), the right's success is built on a structure of ''distortions.'' ''We'' are truth tellers; ''they'' are political liars. 
 This notion is particularly odd given an earlier section of the book in which Nunberg does a nice critical number on what is surely the most overrated essay in the modern canon, George Orwell's turgid, self-righteous and philosophically hopeless ''Politics and the English Language.'' Commenting on Orwell's distinction between words politically inflected and words that plainly name things, Nunberg points out that plain language is as political as any other and will probably be all the more effective because it ''seems to correspond to concrete perception.'' The point, as he has been saying all along, is not to strip all of the political overlay from your language but to make the language that carries your political message the lingua franca of the public sphere. 
 This is not to disdain the truth; in the final analysis the question of what is true and false is paramount. But Nunberg isn't offering a final analysis here, only a rhetorical and political analysis. His claim that he is allied with the truth against the forces of conservative darkness may be endearing, but it is utterly unhelpful.

HEADLINE: Fighting Locally, Fighting Globally 

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AS leaders gather in St. Petersburg for the Group of 8 summit, they have a week's worth of fresh reminders of the outsize role that small numbers of violent extremists play in fueling conflict and controlling global events. 
 On Sunday, Russian special forces killed Shamil Basayev, the man behind the most horrific attacks by Chechnya's rebels. On Tuesday in India, synchronized bombs on the jammed commuter trains of Mumbai, suspected though not proved to be the work of Kashmiri separatists, killed nearly 200 people. On Wednesday, Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, following the example of the Palestinian group Hamas, mounted a raid that captured two Israeli soldiers -- and provoked a far-reaching Israeli military reaction that plunged the region into crisis. 
The far-flung extremists share an ideology of violent Islamic militancy, hostility to the West and a vicious intolerance of other creeds. But the events last week also suggested why the notion of ''global terrorism,'' and the war against it, may be strategically misleading. 
 Sometimes, these groups may cheer one another's bloody successes. But for Hezbollah gunmen, the status of Kashmir is not a high priority, and no Chechen militants are known to have schemed to attack the United States. 
 While the Chechen and Kashmiri separatists operate underground, Hezbollah is a major faction in the Lebanese Parliament and controls several ministries, an official status that the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stressed in commenting on the kidnapping. ''I want to make clear that the event this morning is not a terror act,'' he said, ''but an act of a sovereign state that attacked Israel without reason.''
 Gregory F. Treverton, former vice chairman of the president's National Intelligence Council, said such groups are not in any meaningful sense part of a single movement, even if they occasionally claim alliance with Al Qaeda or lambaste America. ''If you look at this week's events, it's clear that one size does not fit all,'' said Mr. Treverton, now a RAND Corporation analyst. 
 In fact, the vast majority of terrorists are provincial in their goals, said Robert A. Pape, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. His analysis of suicide attacks from 1980 to 2004 for his book, ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism,'' found that 95 percent of attacks worldwide were motivated by resentment of the presence of foreign combat troops.
 To call Islamist terrorism global, he said, ''overplays religion in contrast to political objectives.''
 ''I don't doubt for a moment these groups share information,'' Mr. Pape continued. ''I don't doubt that they share money. But what motivates them primarily is independent, local issues. At its core, it's about political control of territory that the terrorists prize.''
 Mr. Pape's statistics notwithstanding, the Sept. 11 attacks stand as the prime example of what President Bush initially labeled ''terrorists of global reach'' -- those whose goals transcend any local dispute and whose ambitions are mass murder with no immediately practical goal. Osama bin Laden's radicalization involved territorial issues -- Soviet troops in Afghanistan and then American troops in Saudi Arabia -- but his organization ultimately embraced terror not as a means but as an end.
 Moreover, it has taken a global effort by American and allied military and intelligence agencies to destroy much of Al Qaeda's ability to operate. The label, Global War on Terror, has a clarity that has proved useful in conveying the campaign's ambition, rallying support at home and recruiting allies abroad. 
 William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, vigorously defends the formula. ''There were local conflicts on the fringes of World War I and World War II,'' he said. ''But that doesn't mean there wasn't a core fight. A lot of these local groups have ties to one another.'' Some Chechens, he said, have been caught fighting in Afghanistan. So a local territorial grievance sometimes can motivate a radical to join the truly global jihad, Mr. Kristol said. 
 Still, the temptation to portray all wars against jihadists as a common cause can make it difficult for Americans to protest other countries' excesses in local fights that they insist are their own fronts in the global war -- for example, Russia's war in Chechnya.
 ''Other countries dress their actions up as 'the war on terror,' and we have a hard time condemning it,'' said Paul R. Pillar, a retired Central Intelligence Agency analyst who served as national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia from 2000 to 2005. 
 For the administration's critics, the peril of equating the global war on terror with regional threats is on display in Iraq. 
 ''There were no jihadists in Iraq before we invaded,'' said Daniel Benjamin, who served on the Clinton administration's National Security Council. ''There are now thousands, Iraqi and foreign, and they're going to be an enduring problem because many have embraced the global jihadist agenda.'' He said he welcomed a shift he has seen in President Bush's language, away from broad characterizations of the enemy. ''In the long run,'' he said, ''we have an interest in diplomatically winding down some of these local jihads, which are feeding the global jihad.''
 During the cold war, a similar conceptual debate occasionally flared. Was Communism a a monolithic global threat? Or in some places was it a vague creed, coming in local variations often trumped by national interests?
 Europeans sometimes faulted American anti-Communism as unsophisticated, and the American oratory on the war on terror draws similar criticism, even as they cooperate closely with the United States on security matters, just as they did in the cold war.
 ''The Europeans don't buy the concept of global terrorism as a strategic and political idea,'' said Olivier Roy, a French expert on terrorism.
 WHEN confronted with such arguments, Mr. Kristol says: ''It's a war. It's global. And it's about Islamic radicals who are self-consciously trying to create a worldwide terror network.''
 In fact, the major attacks in Madrid and London since 2001, carried out by home-grown cells whose views were shaped by Al Qaeda, do not fit Mr. Pape's profile of the local territorial dispute. But Mr. Roy insists that such groups are best fought by helping Muslims to full citizenship and political engagement.
 ''That's exactly the opposite,'' he said, ''of declaring a global war on Islamic terrorism.''

HEADLINE: A Dorm Grows in Harlem

 BODY:
Graduating from college used to mean leaving your campus dorm and moving into your first grown-up apartment. Unfortunately, overpriced real estate in places like New York, San Francisco and Washington have raised the bar for making that transition to new heights. 
 Some graduates go back home; others put the touch on better-off parents for handouts. Perhaps it was only a matter of time, but economic circumstances have provided yet another alternative: dorms for adults. As Janny Scott reported last week in The Times, a woman named Karen Falcon has provided group living for nearly 150 young people in three Harlem buildings. She has assembled a varied mix -- men and women, graduate students and bartenders -- to minimize potential conflicts.
It's an idea that could spread. Recent graduates working long hours and filling their free time with dates and parties require little more than places to sleep and communal stoves to boil the occasional pot of noodles. Dormitory living also carries a whiff of nostalgia.
 It almost sounds like fun until you stop and remind yourself that these dorms for adults arise from the rigors of the housing market and not from any desire to live in close quarters with strangers. There is a nobler alternative -- to make affordable housing a higher priority for a city that caters more and more to its richest residents. Families with small children that are living off dishwashers' and even teachers' pay are also adrift in this cutthroat market. For the working poor, and increasingly for middle-class families, dorms are not an option, but neither is the going rate on a comfortable home.

HEADLINE: Who'll Treat Us as We Get Older?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Too Many Doctors in the House'' (Op-Ed, July 10), David C. Goodman argues that increasing the number of doctors trained in the United States, as recommended by the Association of American Medical Colleges, would merely increase the number of hospital admissions and expensive diagnostic tests, without improving patient care.
There is an element of turf protection in this attitude, but there is another side to the story. The staffs of outpatient clinics in many large city hospitals are made up largely of foreign doctors supervised by an attending physician or senior resident who might well be an American medical school graduate. Many suburban hospitals have never had a resident who graduated from an American medical school. 
 When I was a member of the admissions committee at a major American medical college, I interviewed many well-qualified applicants who were rejected because of space limitations. 
 If we had the will, we could easily increase the number of doctors by 30 to 50 percent without compromising the quality of medical education or patient care. After all, there is nothing in the medical canon of ethics that obliges physicians to maximize their incomes without regard for their patients' needs. Doctors who are in it for the money would be better off on Wall Street. 

Harold Levey
Brooklyn, July 10, 2006

The writer is a retired associate professor of physiology at Downstate Medical Center, SUNY.

To the Editor:
 David C. Goodman does not mention that about 25 percent of all doctors in America are foreigners, more than half from third-world countries, causing a serious brain drain from poor countries. Eliminating this influx would cause a serious shortage. 
 I agree that there are huge medical costs that appear in the last few months of the terminally ill elderly. This has little to do with the number of physicians. It is an ethical problem. The decision to eliminate care for the terminally ill over age 65, as has been made in some countries, would save billions of dollars. Would Americas accept this?
 Generally, longevity and the quality of life in any small town in New Hampshire are better than New York City, regardless of the number of physicians. 

Norman M. Wall, M.D.
Heathrow, Fla., July 11, 2006

The writer is a retired doctor and educator.

To the Editor:
 The issue is not how many doctors we have, but their training and background. As our nation ages, we need more geriatricians, who are trained to address issues of multiple chronic illnesses and to manage the multiple medications that most older adults are prescribed.
 We also need to shift the focus of our medical care system from secondary and tertiary care to primary prevention of disease. Currently, primary prevention for most doctors means referring patients for screening procedures like mammograms and cholesterol checks. 
 Physicians need training on how to discuss lifestyle risk factors and behavior modification with patients to prevent disease. Most physicians recognize the importance of counseling patients to quit smoking, engage in physical activity and eat a proper diet, yet few do so because they have little training in how to be effective. 

Jan Warren-Findlow
Charlotte, N.C., July 10, 2006

The writer is an assistant professor of health behavior and administration, University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

To the Editor:
 We don't just have too many doctors -- we have too many of the wrong kind. That is, we have too many specialists and subspecialists, but not enough primary care physicians (family physicians, general internists and pediatricians). 
 Research comparing different regions in the United States and comparing the United States with other countries has consistently shown that places with a greater percentage of primary care physicians have better health outcomes and pay less for health care. 
 Unfortunately, the money and prestige in American medicine are in subspecialty medicine. Not surprisingly, fewer and fewer medical students are choosing primary care specialties, especially when they graduate with debt of $100,000 or more. 
 Recent proposed changes to the Medicare fee schedule that would pay physicians more for talking, listening and thinking are a step in the right direction. Debt forgiveness for students who choose primary care specialties or choose to locate in rural and underserved areas should also be considered. 

Mark Ebell, M.D.
Manistee, Mich., July 10, 2006

The writer is the deputy editor of American Family Physician.

To the Editor:
 There is a more promising solution to our health care woes: increasing the number of American-trained nurses. 
 Nurses are the true backbone of our health care system, and the shortage in their ranks is closely associated with poor health outcomes in this country. 
 An adequate supply of American nurses would significantly lessen our nation's habit of poaching highly trained English-speaking nurses from poorer countries, which has had a catastrophic effect upon health care in Africa, the Caribbean and other parts of the developing world.

Sally Bernstein
New York, July 11, 2006

To the Editor:
 David C. Goodman cites cogent reasons why the suggestion of the Association of American Medical Colleges to increase the number of doctors they train by 30 percent won't help patients. 
 We already license many graduates of foreign medical schools, who supplement the more than 15,700 doctors who graduate from American schools each year. 
 These graduates of non-United States medical schools have trained in United States hospital-sponsored residency programs, yet even with these additional doctors, health care is as dismal as noted by Dr. Goodman.

HEADLINE: The Behavior Of Men and Women

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Thanks to Judith Warner for adding some perspective to my frustrations with the differences between men and women (''What Girls Ought to Learn From Boys in 'Crisis,' '' column, July 12). 
This summer, my husband and I are moving from our home of 34 years. Like Ms. Warner's example of the women in Bali who carried the bricks while the men ''undoubtedly'' strategized about efficiency, I find myself doing the larger share of the menial work while my husband theorizes about strategies for maximizing the efficiency of our moving, packing, arranging and discarding activities. 
 I thought that this was just a characteristic of my academic husband. It is somehow comforting to learn that his behavior spans the male sex, across geographic and social, educational and economic groups! 

Barbara Marwell
Madison, Wis., July 12, 2006

To the Editor:
 Amen, Judith Warner! 
 Speaking from the legion of stay-at-home-moms, thank you!
 I have three children under age 6. Because I do not make money, I am not given the same level of respect, interest or value by friends, family, society and my husband. 
 It's been said that raising children is the hardest job in the world. Thanks, but we need a raise.

HEADLINE: All's Fair in Love, War and Lending?

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
A RECENT report asserting that minority applicants with the same credit histories as whites pay more for mortgages has touched off a furious debate about discrimination. 
 The report, released in late May by the Center for Responsible Lending, a Washington advocacy group, examined about 177,000 loan applications from 2004 involving so-called subprime mortgages, which tend to carry interest rates at least 1.5 percentage points higher than ''prime'' loans offered to consumers with good credit.
According to the report, an examination of fixed-rate loans revealed that blacks were 31 percent more likely to be offered a higher rate than whites with the same credit. Latinos were 60 percent more likely to be offered a higher rate. 
 ''It may be that borrowers going in to the same lender are treated different based on their race,'' said Debbie Gruenstein Bocian, the lead author of the report and a researcher at the Center for Responsible Lending. But Ms. Bocian added that minority applicants may simply be likelier than whites to rely on lenders who sell more expensive subprime loans, as such lenders are more frequently found in lower-income areas.
 That is the contention of Janis Bowdler, the senior housing policy analyst with the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group in Washington. While testifying before the House Financial Services Committee last month, Ms. Bowdler offered evidence from the real estate sections of The Washington Post and The Washington Hispanic.
 The Post's advertisements offered an array of standard mortgage products, Ms. Bowdler said, while The Hispanic's ads were for only high-cost loans.
 Part of the problem, she explained, is that 35 percent of Latinos in the United States do not have bank accounts, and 22 percent have no credit scores. And many Latinos do not carry credit cards, which credit bureaus rely on heavily in determining credit scores. There are mortgage products available at reasonably low rates to serve such applicants, but because they require more processing work, Ms. Bowdler said, lenders and brokers are often reluctant to offer them.
 That could change in the coming months, though. According to Alfred King, a spokesman for Fannie Mae, which sets underwriting standards for many types of loans, applicants with nontraditional credit histories will more easily qualify for mortgages starting next month. Fannie Mae's ''My Community Mortgage'' product will require less manual processing work, and eligibility requirements will be eased to allow, for instance, applicants with no rental history.
 Meanwhile, there are those who do not agree with the conclusions drawn by the Center for Responsible Lending. Douglas Duncan, the chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, said the study did not go far enough in accounting for possible differences in loan applications between whites and members of minority groups.
 Among other things, he said, it did not take into consideration the so-called income-to-debt ratios of various applicants -- numbers that help lenders determine the size of the monthly payments that each home buyer can afford.
 According to a survey that Mr. Duncan oversaw, more than 30 percent of mortgage applicants talk to only one lender. If there are differences in what similarly qualified applicants pay for mortgages, he said, these may have to do with how aggressively they shop.
 In other words, if borrowers end up paying 7 percent instead of 6.5 percent, it could be their own fault, in Mr. Duncan's view. The question, he said, is whether borrowers may be ''subjecting themselves'' to a lender who doesn't have their interests at heart.

HEADLINE: An American Foreign Policy That Both Realists and Idealists Should Fall in Love With

BYLINE: By Robert Wright. 
Robert Wright, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, is the author of ''The Moral Animal'' and ''Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny.''

DATELINE: Princeton, N.J. 

 BODY:
AS liberals try to articulate a post-Bush foreign policy, some are feeling a bit of cognitive dissonance. 
 They have always thought of themselves as idealistic, concerned with the welfare of humankind. Not for them the ruthlessly narrow focus on national self-interest of the ''realist'' foreign policy school. That school's most famous practitioner, Henry Kissinger, is for many liberals a reminder of how easily the ostensible amorality of classic realism slides into immorality.
Yet idealism has lost some of its luster. Neoconservatism, whose ascendancy has scared liberals into a new round of soul-searching, seems plenty idealistic, bent on spreading democracy and human rights. Indeed, a shared idealism is what led many liberals to join neocons in supporting the Iraq war, which hasn't turned out ideally. In retrospect, realists who were skeptical of the invasion, like Brent Scowcroft and Samuel Huntington, are looking pretty wise. 
 It's an unappealing choice: chillingly clinical self-interest or dangerously naive altruism? Fortunately, it's a false choice. During the post-cold-war era, the security landscape has changed a lot, in some ways for the worse; witness the role of ''nonstate actors'' last week in India, Israel and Iraq. But this changing environment has a rarely noted upside: It's now possible to build a foreign policy paradigm that comes close to squaring the circle -- reconciling the humanitarian aims of idealists with the powerful logic of realists. And adopting this paradigm could make the chaos of the last week less common in the future.
 Every paradigm needs a name, and the best name for this one is progressive realism. The label has a nice ring (Who is against progress?) and it aptly suggests bipartisan appeal. This is a realism that could attract many liberals and a progressivism that could attract some conservatives.
 With such crossover potential, this paradigm might even help Democrats win a presidential election. But Democrats can embrace it only if they're willing to annoy an interest group or two and also reject a premise common in Democratic policy circles lately: that the key to a winning foreign policy is to recalibrate the party's manhood -- just take boilerplate liberal foreign policy and add a testosterone patch. Even if that prescription did help win an election, it wouldn't succeed in protecting America.
 I.
 Progressive realism begins with a cardinal doctrine of traditional realism: the purpose of American foreign policy is to serve American interests. 
 But these days serving American interests means abandoning another traditional belief of realists -- that so long as foreign governments don't endanger American interests on the geopolitical chess board, their domestic affairs don't concern us. In an age when Americans are threatened by overseas bioweapons labs and outbreaks of flu, by Chinese pollution that enters lungs in Oregon, by imploding African states that could turn into terrorist havens, by authoritarian Arab governments that push young men toward radicalism, the classic realist indifference to the interiors of nations is untenable.
 In that sense progressive realists look a lot like neoconservatives and traditional liberals: concerned about the well-being of foreigners, albeit out of strict national interest. But progressive realism has two core themes that make it clearly distinctive, and they're reflected in two different meanings of the word ''progressive.''
 First, the word signifies a belief in, well, progress. Free markets are spreading across the world on the strength of their productivity, and economic liberty tends to foster political liberty. Yes, the Chinese government could probably reverse the growth in popular expression of the past two decades, but only by severely restricting information technologies that are prerequisites for prosperity. Meanwhile, notwithstanding dogged efforts at repression, political pluralism in China is growing.
 Oddly, this progressive realist faith in markets seems to be stronger than the vaunted neoconservative faith in markets. After all, if you believe that history is on the side of political freedom -- and that this technological era is giving freedom an especially strong push -- your approach to fostering democracy isn't to invade countries and impose it. And if you believe that the tentacles of capitalism help spread freedom, you don't threaten to disrupt economic engagement with China for such small gains as the release of a few political prisoners. 
 A strong Democratic emphasis on economic engagement always threatens to alienate liberal human rights activists, as well as union leaders concerned about cheap labor abroad. But the losses can be minimized, thanks to the second meaning of the word ''progressive.''
 II.
 The American progressives of a century ago saw that as economic activity moved from a regional to a national level, some parts of governance needed to reside at the national level as well. Hence federal antitrust enforcement and the Pure Food and Drug Act. Analogously, problems that today accompany globalization call for institutionalized international responses. 
 In the economic realm, progressivism means continuing to support the World Trade Organization as a bulwark against protectionism -- but also giving it the authority to address labor issues, as union leaders have long advocated. Environmental issues, too, should be addressed at the W.T.O. and through other bodies of regional and global governance. 
 Nowhere does this emphasis on international governance contrast more clearly with recent Republican ideology than in arms control. The default neoconservative approach to weapons of mass destruction seems to be that when you suspect a nation has them, you invade it. The Iraq experience suggests that repeated reliance on this policy could grow wearying. The president, to judge by his late-May overture toward Iran and his subdued tone toward North Korea, may be sensing as much. 
 Still, he is nowhere near embracing the necessary alternative: arms control accords that would impose highly intrusive inspections on all parties. Neoconservatives, along with the Buchananite nationalist right, see in this approach an unacceptable sacrifice of national sovereignty. 
 But such ''sacrifices'' can strengthen America. One reason international weapons inspectors haven't gotten a good fix on Iran's nuclear program is that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty gives them access only to ''declared'' sites. Wouldn't Americans be willing to change that and let inspectors examine America more broadly -- we have nothing to hide, after all -- if that made it harder for other nations to cheat on the treaty? 
 There is a principle here that goes beyond arms control: the national interest can be served by constraints on America's behavior when they constrain other nations as well. This logic covers the spectrum of international governance, from global warming (we'll cut carbon dioxide emissions if you will) to war (we'll refrain from it if you will). 
 This doesn't mean joining the deepest devotees of international law and vowing never to fight a war that lacks backing by the United Nations Security Council. But it does mean that, in the case of Iraq, ignoring the Security Council and international opinion had excessive costs: (1) eroding the norm against invasions not justified by self-defense or imminent threat; (2) throwing away a golden post-9/11 opportunity to strengthen the United Nations' power as a weapons inspector. The last message we needed to send is the one President Bush sent: countries that succumb to pressure to admit weapons inspectors will be invaded anyway. Peacefully blunting the threats posed by nuclear technologies in North Korea and Iran would be tricky in any event, but this message has made it trickier. (Ever wonder why Iran wants ''security guarantees''?) 
 The administration's misjudgment in Iraq highlights the distinction -- sometimes glossed over by neoconservatives -- between transparency and regime change. Had we held off on invasion, demanding in return that United Nations inspections be expanded and extended, we could have rendered Iraq transparent, confirming that it posed no near-term threat. Regime change wasn't essential. 
 To be sure, authoritarianism's demise is a key long-term goal. Authoritarian states never have the natural transparency of free-market democracies, and the evolution of biotechnology will make an increasingly fine-grained transparency vital to security. But this degree of transparency will only slowly become a strict prerequisite for national security, because the bioweapons most plausibly available to terrorists in the near term aren't effective weapons of truly mass destruction. (Anthrax isn't contagious, for example, and there is a vaccine for smallpox.) For now we can be patient and nurture regime change through economic engagement and other forms of peaceful, above-board influence. 
 The result will be more indigenous, more culturally authentic paths to democracy than flow from invasion or American-backed coups d'etat -- and more conducive to America's security than, say, the current situation in Iraq. Democrats can join President Bush in proclaiming that ''freedom is on the march'' without buying his formula for assisting it.
 III.
 When expressing disdain for international governance, the Bush administration morphs from visionary neocon idealist into coolly rational realist. Foreign policy, we're told, is not for naive, ''Kumbaya''-singing liberals who are seduced by illusions of international cooperation. 
 Yet the president, in his aversion to multilateralism, flunks Realism 101. He has let America fall prey to what economists call the ''free rider'' problem. Even if we grant the mistaken premise that the Iraq war would make the whole world safer from terrorism, why should America pay so much blood and treasure? Why let the rest of civilization be a free rider? 
 The high cost of free riders matters all the more in light of how many problems beyond America's borders threaten America's interests. The slaughter in Darfur, though a humanitarian crisis, is also a security issue, given how hospitable collapsed states can be to terrorists. But if addressing the Darfur problem will indeed help thwart terrorism internationally, then the costs of the mission should be shared. 
 President Bush's belated diplomatic involvement in Darfur suggests growing enlightenment, but sluggish ad hoc multilateralism isn't enough. We need multilateral structures capable of decisively forceful intervention and nation building -- ideally under the auspices of the United Nations, which has more global legitimacy than other candidates. America should lead in building these structures and thereafter contribute its share, but only its share. To some extent, the nurturing of international institutions and solid international law is simple thrift.
 And the accounting rules are subtle. As we've seen lately, the cost of military action can go not just beyond dollars and cents, but beyond the immediate toll of dead and wounded. In an age when cellphones can take pictures and videos of collateral damage and then e-mail them, and terrorists recruit via Web site imagery, intervention abroad can bring long-term blowback. 
 Further, when you consider the various ways information technology helps terrorists -- not just to recruit more fighters to the cause, but to orchestrate attacks and spread recipes for munitions -- and you throw in advances in munitions technology, an alarming principle suggests itself: In coming years, grass-roots hatred and resentment of America may be converted into the death of Americans with growing efficiency.
 That domestic security depends increasingly on popular sentiment abroad makes it important for America to be seen as a good global citizen -- respecting international laws and norms and sensing the needs of neighbors. One of President Bush's most effective uses of power was the tsunami relief effort of 2004, which raised regard for Americans in the world's largest Muslim country, Indonesia. Much of the war on terror isn't military.
 Of course, some of it is, and we'll need the capacity to project force anywhere, anytime. Still, a full accounting of the costs of intervention makes it clear that we can't afford to be the world's army.
 Fortunately, globalization has made the peaceful suppression of at least some forms of disorder easier. Economic interdependence makes war among nations less attractive, and never before has this interdependence brought so much transborder contact among businesspeople and politicians. 
 So it's not shocking that India and China, which clashed repeatedly over disputed borders during the cold war, have kept things cool since becoming enmeshed in the global economy. Or that the most worrisome nation of the moment, North Korea, is about the most isolated from the global economy; or that its rival for worrisomeness, Iran, is far from full immersion.
 Obviously, wars can happen even when they're irrational. Still, their growing irrationality is a progressive force worth honoring. It strengthens the case for economic engagement and for regional and other international bodies that help cement commercial entanglement with political cooperation. 
 IV.
 The excesses of neoconservative idealism have prompted various scholars to adapt realist principles to a changing world. The political scientists John Ikenberry and Charles Kupchan outlined a ''liberal realism'' two years ago, and Mr. Ikenberry's book, ''After Victory,'' showed how international governance can serve the interests of hegemonic powers. This fall the historians Anatol Lieven and John Hulsman will publish a foreign policy manifesto called ''Ethical Realism.'' 
 Such works are true to the spirit of Hans Morgenthau, chief architect of realism. Writing in the mid-20th century, he emphasized that realism's implications would change as the world changed. World peace could require radical constraints on national sovereignty, he said, and the nation-state might drop in significance as ''larger units'' rose. 
 Morgenthau seems to have sensed something that later political scientists dwelt on: technology has been making the world's nations more interdependent -- or, as game theorists put it, more non-zero-sum. That is, America's fortunes are growing more closely correlated with the fortunes of people far away; fewer games have simple win-lose outcomes, and more have either win-win or lose-lose outcomes. 
 This principle lies at the heart of progressive realism. A correlation of fortunes -- being in the same boat with other nations in matters of economics, environment, security -- is what makes international governance serve national interest. It is also what makes enlightened self-interest de facto humanitarian. Progressive realists see that America can best flourish if others flourish -- if African states cohere, if the world's Muslims feel they benefit from the world order, if personal and environmental health are nurtured, if economic inequities abroad are muted so that young democracies can be stable and strong. More and more, doing well means doing good. 
 Of course, resources aren't infinite, and the world has lots of problems. But focusing on national interest helps focus resources. Notwithstanding last week's carnage in the Middle East, more people have been dying in Sri Lanka's civil war than in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. But given the threat of anti-American Islamist terrorism, forging a lasting two-state solution in the Middle East is a higher priority than bringing lasting peace to Sri Lanka. 
 This sounds harsh, but it is only acknowledgment of something often left unsaid: a nation's foreign policy will always favor the interests of its citizens and so fall short of moral perfection. We can at least be thankful that history, by intertwining the fates of peoples, is bringing national interest closer to moral ideals. 
 Harnessing this benign dynamic isn't the only redemptive feature of progressive realism. Morgenthau emphasized that sound strategy requires a ''respectful understanding'' of all players in the game. ''The political actor,'' he wrote, ''must put himself into the other man's shoes, look at the world and judge it as he does.'' 
 This immersion in the perspective of the other is sometimes called ''moral imagination,'' and it is hard. Understanding why some people hate America, and why terrorists kill, is challenging not just intellectually but emotionally. Yet it is crucial and has been lacking in President Bush, who saves time by ascribing behavior that threatens America to the hatred of freedom or (and this is a real time saver) to evil. As Morgenthau saw, exploring the root causes of bad behavior, far from being a sentimentalist weakness, informs the deft use of power. Realpolitik is reality-based. 
 Is progressive realism salable? The administration's post-9/11 message may be more viscerally appealing: Rid the world of evil, and do so with bravado and intimidating strength. But this approach has gotten some negative feedback from the real world, and there is a growing desire for America to regain the respect President Bush has squandered. Maybe Americans are ready to meet reality on its own terms.

HEADLINE: Newark Mayor ProposesPlan for First 100 Days

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
In announcing key initiatives of his new administration in the rotunda of City Hall in Newark on Monday, Mayor Cory Booker employed a ''First Hundred Days'' theme reminiscent of the format Franklin D. Roosevelt used to detail the programs he wanted to pull the country out of the Great Depression. 
 The rhetorical touchstone reminded Mr. Booker's audience of nearly 150 of the scope of change he has promised as he takes the reins of a city that Sharpe James controlled as mayor for the last 20 years. Mr. Booker echoed campaign themes that the James administration had become estranged from average residents' concerns, too intent on holding power and controlling patronage and in thrall to development schemes that had harmed the poor and fattened the rich.
 Mr. Booker proposed new police stations and a beefed-up force, a city Department of Children and Families to coordinate programs for struggling families, summer jobs and recreation programs for the young and a revised city master plan geared more to neighborhood redevelopment. 
 Mr. Booker also proposed tying publicly assisted economic development to local hiring requirements, and smoothing the re-entry of former prisoners into productive jobs.
 In many ways it recalled the heady days of the city's election of Kenneth A. Gibson as its first black mayor in 1970. In the first of his four terms, Mr. Gibson emerged as a champion of the national effort to get more federal funds for sagging and poor urban areas and once predicted, ''Wherever American cities are going, Newark will get there first.''

HEADLINE: Fleeting Pathos of a New York Minute

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
YOU might think of it as a New York variation on the ''If a tree falls in the forest'' question.
 In this case: ''If a disturbed man upset about a nasty divorce fiddles with the gas line in his four-story brownstone and the building soon thereafter explodes, falling in a fiery heap on a deluxe Upper East Side block first thing on a Monday morning, does anybody pay much attention?''
In a sense, of course, the answer is yes, particularly for those who lived and worked on and around East 62nd between Madison and Park Avenues, where the blast felt like an earthquake, where firefighters almost outnumbered residents for a while and where Dr. Nicholas Bartha, the building's sole occupant and chief suspect as the cause of the explosion, was later pulled from the rubble in critical condition. 
 But in another sense, the sad story of Dr. Bartha and the beloved brownstone he simply refused to leave is a perfect example of that brand of bizarre but discrete calamity that New York -- a city defined by looking ahead, almost never behind -- experiences, absorbs like a flare crashing back into the sun and then relegates to the category of curiosity, one not even curious enough to remain on the cover of the tabloids past Day Two or inspire flights of headline-writing brilliance. (The New York Post's ''Honey, I Blew Up the House'' was probably the best, containing as it did an implicit ho-hum.)
 ''It wasn't 17 seconds after it happened that people were talking about the worth of the lot -- this is New York,'' said Michael Gross, the author of ''740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building,'' published last year. 
 He added: ''It was a long time before I even heard on the news whether the guy was alive or dead -- that seemed like the last thing anyone was thinking about. There were more important things, unfortunately.''
 He added that perhaps the only truly compelling part of the story was that it happened in a place that has always supposedly been better insulated against catastrophe than most, the Upper East Side, specifically the Gold Coast enclave within it, from Fifth Avenue to Lexington Avenue and 59th Street to 96th Street. 
 That insulation, and the neighborhood's gilded reputation, is what drew Mr. Bartha to the brownstone in the first place and seemed to fuel his obsession never to part with the house to settle divorce judgments.
 ''Behind the impenetrable limestone curtain the rich are very much like you and me but in many ways more gothic because all the drama, acrimony and pathos of their lives are magnified by money,'' Mr. Gross said. ''And for Dr. Bartha, moving to 62nd Street represented -- as every one of the newspapers has said -- his lifetime dream. And he obviously was bound and determined to go down with the ship.''
 His story was one of those that, outside the city, especially on television and mostly because it happened in New York, played as a Grade A example of what newspaper reporters used to call a bacon-cooler. (Bacon on the fork, traveling from breakfast plate to mouth, is interrupted by an especially pause-worthy piece of news.) 
 In the city where it happened, though, it seemed to have a fairly brief half-life, having nothing to do with terrorism and competing as it did with a crowded summer news cycle that has also included some random stabbings, two horrific auto crashes and a postal worker injured in the subway by a man wielding two stolen power saws -- stories that also seemed to play bigger outside the city than in it.
 By Thursday morning, most of the displaced residents had been repatriated to their apartments on 62nd Street, and an excavation machine with a clawlike scoop had already dug its way down to the house's foundation bricks. The operator inside the machine sat with his feet propped up and crossed, a cigarette drooping from his lip, as if he carted away collapsed brownstones between real jobs.
 All that remained of the house's four once-stately stories was a half-intact stoop, crowned by an ornamental metal door that opened onto thin air. Along the wall of the building that used to abut Dr. Bartha's brownstone, a strip of wood paneling that had run along the house's third-floor staircase still clung to the brick, a humble palimpsest of a whole life, or actually of several generations of them.
 The Hermes store on the corner of Madison had re-polished its show windows and fully returned to the business of selling $850 cashmere shawls.
 Inside the Design Within Reach furniture store directly across from the new gap in the block's facade, the front window was cracked, but inside, light jazz drowned out sounds of excavation and a woman was listening to a sales clerk extol the virtues of a $2,000 Dordoni desk.
 The sidewalk across from the building had been reopened that morning, and by lunchtime, a small crowd gathered to watch the creation of a vacant lot. But the crowd was smaller than the one that gathers around the Naked Cowboy in Times Square on most days. 
 And most passers-by merely looked over as they sped down the block, some pausing in the midst of cellphone conversations to lift the phone and snap a quick shot of the scene to send to friends (probably ones who didn't live in New York).
 ''It really came down neat, didn't it?'' said one man in basketball shorts, who paused longer than most. ''Kind of like one of those controlled demolitions.''
 A construction worker on the sidewalk tried mostly in vain to keep people from passing too close to the trucks where the scoop was depositing the remains of the house. Many ignored him and scooted by just a couple of feet from the deafening rain of debris, looking aggrieved.
 It brought to mind an image from E. B. White's famous essay ''Here Is New York,'' about the precise distance that he imagined as providing both the intimate connection and vast separation peculiar to big cities, especially New York: 18 inches, sufficient for everything but the worst, like 9/11, which everyone must feel.
 ''BETTER than most dense communities,'' White wrote of New York, ''it succeeds in insulating the individual (if he wants it, and almost everybody wants or needs it) against all enormous and violent and wonderful events that are taking place every minute.''
 ''A man was killed by a falling cornice,'' he wrote, recounting a fresh headline from the New York of his day. ''I was not a party to the tragedy, and again the inches counted heavily.''
 Accounting for inflation, maybe yesterday's falling cornice is today's falling town house. And for those who were not a party to its collapse -- eight million give or take -- the inches might as well have been as many miles.

HEADLINE: My Neighbor, My Buyer

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
SANFORD I. WEILL, the former chairman of Citigroup, and his wife, Joan, sold a co-op penthouse last month at 14 East 90th Street to Elizabeth A. Sackler, the arts patron known for her contributions to the Brooklyn Museum.
 The apartment, which has a large terrace, had an asking price of $10.5 million.
Mr. Weill, 73, stepped down as the chairman of Citigroup in April. He ranked No. 562 this year on the Forbes magazine list of the world's richest people, with a net worth estimated at $1.4 billion. His Citigroup pension is reported to be valued at more than $1 million a year. He continues to be paid as a consultant for the bank and receives a car and driver and free travel on company jets. 
 Property records show that Mr. Weill also owns a house in Greenwich, Conn. 
 Ms. Sackler, who already lives in the 13-story building but on a lower floor, is a trustee of the Brooklyn Museum. She has given money to the museum to create the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, where Judy Chicago's ''Dinner Party'' will be displayed. A foundation created by Ms. Sackler donated the work to the museum in 2002. The center will open next year. 
 Ms. Sackler is also known as an advocate for returning ritual items to American Indian tribes. In 1992, she bought three ritual masks at a Sotheby's auction and returned them to the Hopi and Navajo tribes. The same year she established the American Indian Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation. 
 A representative for Mr. Weill said he was traveling and was not available for comment. Mr. Weill's broker, Kyle W. Blackmon, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, said he was not permitted to discuss the transaction. Three calls to Ms. Sackler were not returned. 

Brooklyn's Film Colony
 THE actress Emily Mortimer and her husband, the actor Alessandro Nivola, paid $2.45 million last month for a 25-foot-wide four-story town house on Dean Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. The house is half a block from a town house that the actor Heath Ledger bought for $3.6 million last September. 
 Jim M. Kerby, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, said the home was listed for $150,000 less than the couple paid for it. He received offers from about a dozen interested buyers, he said, and that drove up the price. 
 ''I think we hit the right season,'' Mr. Kerby said, describing the reaction to the house when it came on the market in March. ''I guess it was just home-buying time. There was an incredible frenzy. It's a 25-foot-wide house, one of those things that attract everybody who wants a big house. They want a wide one.''
 He said the previous owners put on an unusual semi-circular addition at the back of the house, on the second floor, containing the kitchen and a breakfast area. Other than the addition, which he compared to something from a spaceship, Mr. Kerby described the home as ''a classic old Greek Revival house.''
 He said that at an open house in March, the proximity to Mr. Ledger's new home, which has a three-car garage, was a frequent topic of conversation.
 ''I think everybody asked about the Heath Ledger house,'' he said. ''They wanted to make sure the value was there. I pretty much let them discover that for themselves.''
 Ms. Mortimer, daughter of the British playwright and author John Mortimer, has appeared in numerous films, including the recent Woody Allen movie ''Match Point'' and in the remake of ''The Pink Panther.''
 She and her husband met while filming ''Love's Labour's Lost,'' which was released in 2000. They were married in 2003. Mr. Nivola has also acted in ''Laurel Canyon,'' ''The Clearing'' and several other movies. 
 A lawyer for the couple, Howard M. Brickner, said they planned to move to Brooklyn from the West Coast. 

Moving Uptown
 AHMASS L. FAKAHANY, a vice chairman and the chief administrative officer of Merrill Lynch, paid $4.92 million last month for a 1,800-square-foot penthouse at 230 West 56th Street, a condo building known as the Park Imperial. The apartment was owned by Moya Doherty, the producer of ''Riverdance,'' the Irish music and dance extravaganza, and her husband, John McColgan, the show's director. They bought it in 2004 for $675,000 less than they sold it for. 
 Mr. Fakahany and his wife, Alsun Keogh, had previously owned a co-op at the Police Building at 240 Centre Street, which they sold last month. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing listed Mr. Fakahany's total compensation for 2005, including bonuses, as $21 million. Mr. Fakahany did not respond to a request for comment. 

They'll Never Tell
 IF Gov. George E. Pataki signs a bill that would make co-op apartment sales prices public for the first time, the boards of many co-op buildings will probably take steps to protect the identity of buyers from prying eyes, according to lawyers and real estate professionals. 
 Arthur I. Weinstein, a lawyer and the vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said co-op boards might allow buyers to buy apartments in the name of a corporation or a trust as a way of keeping their names out of public records.
 That would be a change for many co-ops that still require apartments to be bought by individuals, not by corporations or other entities. For many years that was a legal requirement, Mr. Weinstein said, but a change in tax law in 1986 allowed corporations or trusts to own co-op shares. 
 Slowly, boards began to adapt, and today there are many that allow such purchases when it benefits the buyer because of tax or estate planning reasons. 
 But a key element of co-op ownership is being able to control who your neighbors are. So when a trust buys an apartment, Mr. Weinstein said, the board will most likely insist on side agreements that specify who is allowed to live there. It might also require the real buyer to sign a guarantee that maintenance and other charges will be paid. 
 Mr. Weinstein said the proposed law would probably make those kinds of purchases more common.
 ''There may be greater pressure to do so, certainly for celebrities who want to maintain privacy or any individual who wants to maintain privacy,'' he said. ''But in those cases the co-op will have to enter into occupancy agreements to make sure the co-op knows who the occupant will be.'' 
 The bill, which was proposed at the request of city officials, was passed by the State Legislature last month and will be sent to the governor for his signature later this year. 
 Mary Ann Rothman, the executive director of the co-op and condo council, said that she thought the change was unnecessary and an incursion into privacy. But she added that council leaders had decided not to oppose it, largely because they considered its passage inevitable, since it had the city's backing. 
 The change is intended to make the process of determining appraisal figures and property taxes more transparent. By including co-op sales figures in an online database, it will also make more information available to buyers and sellers. 
 Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Terra Holdings, which owns Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, said that buyers and sellers would still need brokers to give them a full picture of the market. A sales price on its own means little, he said, without information about the size or condition of the apartment. And that is still something that most people will have to get from a broker.

HEADLINE: Unemployed, Maybe Homeless, And Starting Over After Age 55

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
The last two years have been tough for Hamlett Singleton, 60, of the Bronx. 
 The company she worked for went bankrupt, and she lost her house to foreclosure; since then, she's been unemployed and living in homeless shelters.
But the biggest obstacle to landing a job, she said, is not her homeless status but her age. 
 ''I sent so many resumes out,'' but no employers responded, said Mrs. Singleton, who attended two years of college and held many clerical jobs, including one for seven years for the federal government. 
 Mrs. Singleton is one of a growing number of adults over 55 in New York City who are unemployed and homeless, according to the Partnership for the Homeless, a Manhattan-based nonprofit organization serving all five boroughs. 
 ''It's only gotten worse'' in the last few years, said Deborah Ellis, the group's director of services for older adults. Ms. Ellis and others report that increasing numbers of older adults, even middle-class workers and those with higher levels of education, are becoming unemployed and homeless for the first time. The causes, they say, include a shortage of affordable housing, high health care costs, aging baby boomers who are living longer and need to keep working, and age discrimination.
 Mrs. Singleton is in the partnership's senior aides program, which helps low-income, hard-to-employ older adults make the transition back into the work force. The goal is to provide subsidized on-the-job training as a bridge to permanent employment. 
 Mrs. Singleton is training as an administrative assistant and data-entry clerk at the partnership, one of about 20 community service organizations that have sites in the city where participants can learn skills and obtain current references to help land jobs. 
 Participants receive stipends for 20 hours a week at the state's minimum wage, $6.75 an hour. 
 ''Many need a lot of convincing to make them realize they are still marketable,'' said Marion Ogunusi, the program's director.
 Veronica G. Drew, 58, of Manhattan, who is in training at the Bowery Residents' Committee, a social service agency in Lower Manhattan, said: ''It can be scary and hard. I spent almost a year looking.''
 One woman, now in her late 50's, who went through the program last year, said, ''I had the skills, but I didn't have the confidence.'' The woman, who insisted on anonymity to protect her privacy, has a master's in nursing from Columbia University and more than 30 years of experience in health care, but when she began suffering from major depression several years ago, she ended up living on the A train.
 Today, she has her own apartment and works as a nurse in a drug treatment clinic in the Bronx, earning $32 an hour. She got the job after completing her subsidized training.
 Ms. Ogunusi said that only about 10 percent of participants in the senior aides program were homeless, but ''most are at the point where they could become homeless.'' Participants must be 55 or older, and be living at or below the federal poverty level.
 During the training period, participants in the partnership's program are expected to continue their job search and to attend job-readiness workshops that cover topics like resume preparation and ''soft skills'' like office etiquette, personal hygiene and dressing for work. 
 A variety of other organizations offer schooling in English as a second language, study toward a high school equivalency diploma, computer training and training in fields identified by the city as job-growth areas, like administrative, home care and financial services. 
 ''I wanted to learn the computer and bone up on some clerical skills,'' said Gloria Wilson, 69, of Harlem, who is learning those skills as part of her training at the Civic Association Serving Harlem. 
 While participants often have significant barriers to securing jobs, like mental and physical health problems or difficulties with transportation or housing, Ms. Ogunusi said, once employers see the merits of older workers, they often come back to hire more. Older people tend to have a good work ethic, she said, and, with no child care responsibilities, they are often more reliable, punctual and flexible.
 Amalia O'Toole, 78, of Brooklyn, a seasoned administrative assistant and former schoolteacher with a master's degree in Romance languages, was unemployed for almost 15 years because of medical problems that resulted in the amputation of her right leg. But despite her long absence from the job market, her physical limitations and her age, she was offered a permanent full-time job at the Salvation Army in Manhattan after training there. 
 The program serves 85 to 180 older adults each year, Ms. Ogunusi said, and 28 to 35 find permanent jobs. 
 The senior aides program receives $531,000 a year from federal funds and an additional $67,000 from the partnership. ''It's not a handout,'' said Glendale V. Johnson, program officer for Senior Service America, the nonprofit organization in Silver Spring, Md., that channels funds to the partnership. ''It's training and getting people into the work force.''
 Senior Service America is one of 13 national sponsors of the Senior Community Service Employment Program, financed by a Labor Department grant under the Older Americans Act. 
 Last year, $432.3 million was allocated nationally for the program. Last month, the House passed legislation to reauthorize the Older Americans Act for fiscal years 2007 to 2011. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee of the Senate unanimously approved the reauthorization bill without amendment in late June; it currently awaits Senate floor consideration.
 By 2014, the nation will be more dependent than ever on older workers, according to a recent projection of labor force trends prepared by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. The report, commissioned by Senior Service America, determined that workers 55 and over would account for close to three-quarters of the growth in the nation's labor force in the next decade.
 ''I never thought I'd be in this situation,'' said Mrs. Singleton, the senior aides program participant, who is following up with Con Ed about a customer service job after making a contact at a recent job fair.
 ''Get out there and help yourself, so they can help you,'' she advises, but she also warned against being judgmental about the homeless and unemployed. ''You never know,'' she said. ''It might be you next time.''

 BODY:
However uncertain the economy may be, the restaurant business in the financial district appears to be thriving. These restaurants have all opened in the past year. 

BOBBY VAN'S STEAKHOUSE AND GRILL
(212) 344-8463; 25 Broad Street (Exchange Place); $$$; Article: 10/26/05. 

This branch of a Bridgehampton mainstay opened last fall in the former Vine space with a traditional steakhouse menu. The lower level, the Grill, has a more informal and less expensive menu of salads, sandwiches and entrees like chicken pot pie, roast beef hash and sesame-crusted tuna.

BROUWERS OF STONE STREET
(212) 785-5400; 45 Stone Street (South William Street); $$; Article: 6/14/06.
Evoking old New York, this restaurant anchors one end of what was the first paved street in Manhattan. The restaurant is currently open only for lunch, with a menu by Michael Sullivan, formerly of Chanterelle and Le Zinc, that includes Gold Coast steamers, a raw bar, baby back ribs with a scallion pancake and onion soup with beer.
Brouwers plans to begin serving dinner next month.

FLAMES
(212) 514-6400; 5 Gold Street (Maiden Lane); $$$; Article: 1/11/06.
This branch of a steakhouse in Westchester serves prime dry-aged steaks, seafood that includes lobster and baked clams, veal medallions and other Italian dishes.

HARRY'S STEAK AND HARRY'S CAFE
(212) 785-9200; 97 Pearl Street (Hanover Square); $$$; Article: 5/10/06.
Harry Poulakakos, who closed Harry's at Hanover Square three years ago, recently reopened it as two restaurants. Harry's Steak, in the former wine cellar, offers steaks, seafood and other dishes. The second restaurant, Harry's Cafe (with an entrance at One Hanover Square), serves small plates, sandwiches and main dishes, including a pork shank and strip steak. Each restaurant has a list of wines from Mr. Poulakakos's fabled cellar.

P. J. CLARKE'S ON THE HUDSON
(212) 285-1500; 4 World Financial Center; $$; Article: 12/28/05.
This 220-seat branch of P. J. Clarke's, an 1884 saloon on Third Avenue, is full of dark wood, red leather and checked tablecloths. Burgers and fries, crab cakes and a raw bar anchor the menu.

TRINITY PLACE
(212) 964-0939; 115 Broadway (entrance on Cedar Street); $$; Article: 6/14/06.
The former United States Realty Bank Vault, a 19th-century landmark, is now a restaurant. The entrance is through the huge door of what was a giant safe. Donal Crosbie, who worked at Morrell Wine Bar and Cafe, is the chef. His menu offers contemporary fare kissed by Europe (halibut a la grecque) and Asia (Asian cod cakes). The brunch menu has a full Irish breakfast.

HEADLINE: For a Patient Backwater, a Plan for Revival 

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
Someone has sawed a man-size hole into the tin sheet separating 204th Street from the Harlem River, and strung Christmas lights around the opening. It is a fitting act of do-it-yourself urban design for Sherman Creek, a desolate neighborhood that has never had much of the city-sponsored kind. 
 Despite decades of debate, New York's planners have never managed to inspire much development among the parking lots, trash-strewn streets and one-story warehouses of the area, a 100-acre waterfront neighborhood where riverside streets are often capped with sheets of corrugated tin. Sherman Creek is among Manhattan's largest remaining tracts of land with little housing or commerce.
But many people see potential. ''This is great land because it's beside the river,'' said Emiliano Romero, a stocky man with a gleaming shaved head, who was selling fruit milkshakes and sugar-cane juice at Ninth Avenue and 202nd Street, between a tow pound and a small Consolidated Edison station. ''You build housing here, you can charge a bundle.'' 
 The Department of City Planning agrees. It proposed last month to rezone much of Sherman Creek, allowing residential building in waterfront plots now zoned for manufacturing, and increasing the permitted bulk of residential buildings in eastern Inwood. In addition, the Department of Parks and Recreation is filling the waterfront street-ends with five small parks, which will include a kayak launch, a barbecue space, fishing perches and game tables. The project has just won the agency a design award from the Municipal Art Society.
 The rezoning would allow developers to construct bulkier buildings in return for agreeing to charge affordable rents on 20 percent of their apartments. But some neighbors have objected, saying the plan should call for 30 percent affordable housing, as did last year's rezoning of Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
 ''It's a plan that expedites gentrification,'' said Martin Collins, the chairman of Community Board 12, which covers the area that includes Sherman Creek. 
 But Neill Coleman, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that city-owned land had been available for building in Greenpoint, while the Sherman Creek plan involved coaxing developers into including affordable housing in their buildings.
 Word of the plan has spread. Amid the tangle of trash at the end of 207th Street, a shirtless man sat on a milk crate, surrounded by shopping carts. ''There's going to be a walkway down to the waterfront,'' he said cheerfully. ''It's been in the blueprints for a long time. I'm holding it down until they come.'' ALEX MINDLIN

HEADLINE: City on a Hill

 BODY:
Ridge Hill Village, the $600 million mini-city that the billionaire developer Bruce Ratner wants to build on a woodsy hilltop in Yonkers, could well be the economic godsend that city officials have been pining for. Or it could be a false godsend. Serious concerns about its scale and traffic impact remain, so even though the Yonkers City Council gave the project a big push forward last week by approving a necessary change of zoning for the property, the time for celebration has not arrived. 
 Two City Council members who have long stood in principled opposition to the project, Dee Barbato and John Murtagh, voted against the zoning change. They insist that they don't object to development per se, they just want the city to strike the best deal possible for itself, particularly when the deal involves carving up one of the largest pristine open spaces in the region into thousands of offices, shops, hotel rooms and apartments, with a correspondingly huge influx of people and cars. Their warnings about congestion on local roads, the cost of fire protection and squishy estimates of tax revenues have been a worthy service to their constituents. 
It's important that governments should take a tough negotiating stance with a powerful developer like Mr. Ratner (who also happens to be the developer of The Times's new headquarters in Manhattan). But the city's approach to the Ridge Hill project has long been cloaked by a certain compliant fuzziness -- the appearance of its being a rigged deal. At one point it looked like it was going to be yet another lucrative pet project of one of the quasi-governmental agencies set up by and for officials in the Yonkers inner circle, centered on the mayor's office.
 The agency, the Ridge Hill Development Corporation, planned to control millions of dollars in lease payments from the development. It agreed to send the revenue directly to the city treasury, where the money belongs, only after a public outcry. 
 The saga has also left Yonkers officials divided and squabbling. A pro-Ridge Hill coalition on the City Council was in a headlong rush to hand the bulldozer keys to Mr. Ratner, even voting -- illegally, it turned out -- to rewrite the city charter when it didn't have enough votes ram the zoning change through. That unseemly gesture was rightly rebuffed in court, but then the Council recently got the extra vote it needed when Councilwoman Sandy Annabi flipped her nay vote, saying that an increase in tax revenue promised to the city by the developer had eased her concerns sufficiently.
 Not everything is fixed. Visit the slick Ridge Hill web site, and you may be dazzled by the dense beauty of this suburban architectural vision. But click on the link marked ''Roadway Improvements,'' and you will find a blank screen with the words: ''Coming Soon.'' It's not encouraging. 
 That is one area in which the Ridge Hill plan can still be improved. Affordable housing is another. At another huge development in Brooklyn that Mr. Ratner proposes to build, an amazing 50 percent of housing units will be sold to low- and middle-income residents. It's no coincidence that Brooklyn is home to one of the country's noisiest and most energetic community organizations, Acorn, which Mr. Ratner took pains to make an early ally. 
 With enough effort, the little people can make themselves heard. They must keep insisting that city and Ridge Hill officials listen to residents' concerns about traffic and other issues, and fight to work out a solution that includes input from Westchester County and the Town of Greenburgh, a wary next-door-neighbor. Even though the city is resolutely moving forward in aligning its goals with Mr. Ratner's, the battle of Ridge Hill is far from over. Now is not the time for skeptics to give up. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 23, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An editorial last week about the Ridge Hill Village project in Yonkers mischaracterized the units earmarked for low and middle-income residents at another project, the proposed Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn. These units will be rented, not sold.

HEADLINE: Paying for More Than a U-Haul

 BODY:
The news that Swiss Army Brands Inc. is getting financial help from Connecticut to build a new corporate headquarters is unsurprising. The state has for years given companies grants or loans to encourage expansion or new construction. But Swiss Army Brands got $1.5 million in loans and $650,000 on sales tax exemptions on construction materials to help the company move exactly seven miles -- from Shelton to Monroe. 
 At the groundbreaking ceremony, Gov. M. Jodi Rell said that the new construction would be good for the state's economy and would create jobs. No doubt it will. But the state Department of Economic and Community Development told another story. The department said that the company, which employs 170 workers, got the money because it was considering moving to New York State.
The department has long defended such tactics because it considers subsidizing businesses a necessary part of fending off poachers from other states. But in this case the subsidies seem more a knee-jerk reaction than an economic strategy, especially in light of the fact that Connecticut is dead last in business creation out of 50 states.
 Moreover, an astonishing 73 percent of all businesses in Connecticut employ 10 or fewer employees. It's highly unlikely that such enterprises get even a passing glance from the bureaucracy, let alone generous low-interest loans, even though small businesses are the engines for economic growth here. Indeed, they would count themselves lucky if the state gave them a U-Haul.

HEADLINE: Fishing Depletes Mediterranean Tuna, Conservationists Say 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: SUCURAJ, Croatia 

 BODY:
Two decades ago, the channels that separate the Adriatic Islands here were brimming with giant bluefin tuna, a species so plentiful that tourists used to climb ladders by the sea to watch the schools swim by.
 Today, these majestic predators are rarely if ever caught. ''You have to work a lot harder to catch fish of any kind,'' said Lubomir Petricivic, a fisherman who recently opened a restaurant in the harbor here. ''Tuna? Impossible. We don't have any; we can't get it.''
The tuna population in the Mediterranean is nearing extinction, a new World Wildlife Fund report concludes, with catches down 80 percent over the past few years, even for high-tech trawlers that now comb remote corners of the sea in search of the hard-to-find fish. 
 ''This is past the alarm stage,'' said Simon Cripps, director of the global marine program at the World Wildlife Fund, who compares the situation to strip mining. ''We are seeing a complete collapse of the tuna population. It could disappear and never come back.'' The group is urging the European Union to impose an immediate fishing moratorium until the international body that regulates tuna catches meets in Dubrovnik, Croatia, in November.
 Many edible fish stocks in the Mediterranean and its extension, the Adriatic, have sharply declined in the past decade because of pollution and intensive fishing, including crayfish and John Dory, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 In Croatia, much of the fish eaten at seaside resorts is imported from as far away as the United States.
 But it is the bluefin tuna that is in crisis, thanks to a new and lucrative European network of fishing and fish farming companies that provide the prized fish to sushi and sashimi markets in Japan.
 With tuna prices going as high as $15 a pound in Tokyo, European trawlers fish for tuna aggressively and illegally, far exceeding international quotas meant to protect the species, scientists said. Compounding the problem is the recent development of tuna fattening farms in Croatia, Spain, Turkey and other Mediterranean countries.
 Now, even small juvenile tuna, captured in the few corners of the Mediterranean where the species still breeds or even from the Atlantic, can be brought to the vast underwater cages that line the Croatian coast, where they are fed for months or years until they are ready for market. 
 And so, though few tuna are in Croatia's seas and none are in its restaurants, tuna is one of this country's most lucrative food exports. One hundred percent of Croatia's tuna is farm-fattened, ending up as toro -- precious, fatty raw tuna. 
 Officially, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, or Iccat, restricts tuna catches across the Mediterranean to 32,000 tons to ensure the survival of the species. But the new W.W.F. report says that current fishing levels are 50 percent beyond that, because of ''illegal, unregulated and unreported production.''
 Because of the small size of fish being harvested for farms, ''farming is being used to bypass attempts at regulation,'' Dr. Cripps said.
 Croatia regulates commercial trawling in its waters to protect local fisheries, with laws so restrictive that many local fisherman have quit. Abandoned fishing boats dot the coastline.
 It is difficult for the relatively poor Croatian fisherman to compete in tuna fishing anyway, because hunting the species now requires long trips and expensive technology.
 In the Mediterranean, high-tech tuna boats from countries like France, Italy and Spain use sonar and airplane spotters to find schools in the remaining tuna grounds, off Cyprus, Egypt and Libya.
 But Croatia, with its vast pristine coastline, turns out to be a perfect place for fattening farms. Started less than a decade ago, they now employ hundreds of Croatians, 95 percent of them former fishermen. 
 Accurate population statistics on the fast and migratory fish are difficult to compile, and catches are self-reported, all of which presents a confusing picture at best. Numbers from fishing vessel surveys do not match scientific estimates, which do not match national reports or export tallies, according to the F.A.O.
 But the anecdotal evidence of the tuna's decline is alarming.
 A ship owned by the environmental group Greenpeace spent a week recently trailing French, Italian and Spanish tuna boats in the far reaches of the Mediterranean with plans to confront a trawler engaged in illegal fishing; the crew's hopes were stymied because it discovered that the trawlers had been unable to find a single tuna to catch.
 ''We went out trying to find trouble and what we found was a fishery on the brink of collapse,'' said Karli Thomas, who was on the boat. ''This industry has a limited shelf life.''
 ''Significant negative changes'' have occurred in the fish stocks of the Adriatic because of overfishing, said Dr. Nedo Vrgoc of the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries in Split, Croatia, with a particularly steep reduction in long-lived fish species like rays, John Dory and anglerfish.
 Because of intense regulation of coastal waters and Croatia's poorly equipped fleet, the situation is relatively better near Croatia than in the open Adriatic or the full Mediterranean, Dr. Vrgoc said. 
 ''The open Adriatic is exposed to exploitation of the better equipped and several times more numerous Italian fishing fleet,'' he said, and ''there is almost no regulation.''
 Tuna farms are licensed by the government and must conduct an environmental impact study, he said.
 The huge thrice-a-day feeding frenzies on the farms put pressure on local fish stocks since the ''food'' is often bought from local fishermen, and the waste produced in the aftermath of the meals can lead to pollution.

HEADLINE: Replica of New Orleans: A Study in Urban Cloning 

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: LAFAYETTE, La. 

 BODY:
New Orleans is supposed to be 130 miles east of this Cajun country capital on the Vermillion River, but there in the distance, rising from the swampland, is something that looks very familiar.
 The quaint row houses of the French Quarter are off Interstate 10, past the strip malls. There are Garden District-style mansions in a neighborhood named the Garden District, and blocks full of Creole cottages, lush courtyards and lacy ironwork. There is even a street called Elysian Fields.
It is not the Crescent City, however, but rather River Ranch, a commercial development here that is a virtual re-creation of much of historic residential New Orleans, meticulous in detail and substantial in size, with a growing population of more than a thousand on about 300 acres.
 The project was started about 10 years ago but now is attracting the attention of New Orleans residents displaced by Hurricane Katrina who long to have a wrought-iron balcony or two in their lives again. 
 ''I looked at it and thought, 'This is quite nice!' '' said Hortense Reine, a New Orleans evacuee who is staying in Lafayette and wants to buy a River Ranch apartment. ''I think it's very interesting what they've done and that imitation is a form of flattery.''
 Many former residents like the project so much that they believe its mirror-image designs should be used to rebuild the ruined neighborhoods of New Orleans, an idea that some state officials have embraced. David Terrie, a New Orleans native who has taken solace on the slightly familiar streets of the planned community, considers it an enthusiastic tribute to his lost home. 
 ''River Ranch blows my mind,'' Mr. Terrie said. ''When I first saw it, I called everyone in my family and said, 'You've got to see this.' Why couldn't they do something like that in New Orleans?''
 But for all its charm and easy livability, River Ranch has disturbed others who quarrel with its architectural style. They see it as the design equivalent of cubic zirconium, the epitome of what many in New Orleans hope the rebuilt city will never be: an imitation New Orleans, a pretty postcard version of a real city. 
 ''It's hard to describe my gut reaction to that place -- it's disgust,'' said Donna LeBlanc, a native New Orleanian who lives in Lafayette just a few minutes from River Ranch. Ms. LeBlanc firmly disagrees with her mother, Mrs. Reine, who has been staying with her. ''If someone gave me a house in River Ranch, I'd sell it and go live someplace else. I've never been anywhere that tried to be such a complete imitation of something else.''
 Carefully planned communities like River Ranch stand at the crossroads of the debate over what should replace the flooded neighborhoods of New Orleans and damaged Gulf Coast towns. The development is a model of a design philosophy known as New Urbanism, which stresses densely packed housing, green town squares, easy access to transportation, and architecture with a historical theme.
 New Urbanism, which began in the 1990's, has been popular in the last year among smaller Gulf Coast towns, but it has yet to gain traction among New Orleans residents and planners, many of whom say the old urbanism worked just fine.
 The resistance focuses not so much on planning principles that favor density and green space as on the traditional styles that New Urbanists seem wedded to. 
 ''We don't need a facsimile of ourselves,'' said David Waggonner, of Waggonner & Ball, a New Orleans architecture firm that has been active in post-hurricane planning. ''There were some good ideas in old New Orleans. There are ideas worth studying, and we should learn from them, but it's not my nature to think it's natural to copy.''
 Critics also say that New Urbanist designs tend to be too rigid for contemporary times and that they cater to developers and rich homeowners. In River Ranch, prices start around $265,000 and run into the millions. 
 Still, a civic group in the flooded Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans, near Lake Pontchartrain, invited a group of New Urbanist planners to the city a few months ago to help sketch designs for a rebuilt neighborhood. 
 Residents are awaiting the group's final recommendations, which in draft form focus on things like making Gentilly more compact and pedestrian-friendly. Developed in the early to mid-1900's with bungalows and wide streets, Gentilly was the early suburban answer to old New Orleans. The neighborhood, devastated by flooding after the storm, still resembles a ghost town. 
 ''Some things the residents will embrace, and some other things, well, I'm waiting to see,'' said Cynthia Hedge-Morrell, a city councilwoman who represents Gentilly. 
 Ms. Hedge-Morrell said some early proposals ''didn't fit the feel'' of the area. 
 ''For instance,'' she said, ''they talked about making it possible to walk everywhere. Having lived in Gentilly, I don't know if people really want to walk everywhere.''
 In the days after the storm, Bring New Orleans Back, a commission set up by Mayor C. Ray Nagin, resisted the New Urbanist ideas. But the Louisiana Recovery Authority, a state agency guiding the rebuilding, embraced the ideas and hired the lead architect for River Ranch, Steven Oubre, to be part of a team of planners who created a regional vision for the state. The plans were submitted recently.
 Mr. Oubre said that momentum was building beyond Gentilly and that his firm, Architects Southwest, and other New Urbanist planners had submitted other proposals. 
 If the people of New Orleans were introduced to the concepts, he said, ''I think overwhelmingly the population would support this.''
 ''There is a sense among the design community that New Urbanism is nothing but a throwback to the past and isn't warranted,'' he added. ''I don't agree with that.''
 Many former New Orleanians said they were drawn to River Ranch out of sentimentality and a longing for a New Orleans in which urban problems had been erased.
 ''We started to worry about the crime in New Orleans years ago, then we found this and fell in love with it because it reminded us of Uptown,'' said Colin Riggs, a River Ranch boutique owner who used to live in New Orleans. ''It has the pretty balconies and shops and restaurants and all.''
 Given the difficulties the city is facing, Ms. Riggs added, ''I think this is better than the real thing; I think of it as copying the good old days, and that's a good thing.''
 There are a lot of rules in River Ranch: The shutters must be functional. Ceiling heights are to be 10 feet on the ground floor, nothing less. Bricks must be old.
 The bricks for Karen Daigle's Garden District home in River Ranch came from an old peanut factory in Virginia. Ms. Daigle has been in River Ranch since its beginning and is now the marketing director. Touches like antique brick give the area charm and character, she said, but it is still not the same as the original. 
 ''That was the feel of New Orleans and hopefully it will be again,'' Ms. Daigle said. ''We're not ready to give up on New Orleans. It makes me want to cry every time I think about it.''
 Ms. LeBlanc is sad, too, but for different reasons. River Ranch makes her think about New Orleans, she said, and ''I think I'd rather have my memories.''

HEADLINE: Link to Disgraced Lobbyist Throws a Curve Into a Race

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: MARIETTA, Ga., July 13 

 BODY:
It is curious enough to see Ralph Reed, a man who was on the cover of Time magazine at age 33, the man widely credited with galvanizing evangelical Christians into a national political force, putting everything he has into a race for the relatively low-profile job of lieutenant governor of Georgia.
 But it is stranger still to see him losing ground. Because of Mr. Reed's entanglement in a national lobbying scandal, a political contest that once seemed well within his grasp has turned into a battle for his personal and professional reputation, and it is not clear whether he will survive the Republican primary on Tuesday.
At a recent rally here in the Atlanta suburbs, where people ate hot dogs and strawberries compliments of the Cobb County Republican Women's Club, a longtime ally of Mr. Reed's in a red ''Support Our Troops'' sweater pulled the candidate close and whispered anxiously in his ear. 
 ''Don't worry,'' Mr. Reed said, with a glint of impatience. ''We know what we're doing. Just call your friends and get them to vote.'' As the ally opened her mouth to speak again, he silenced her with a firm, ''We're fine.''
 But with campaign commercials hammering away at Mr. Reed's ties to Jack Abramoff, a powerful lobbyist who has pleaded guilty to fraud and corruption, analysts say Mr. Reed, 45, will be fine only if he can motivate his legendary -- or, some contend, mythical -- base, and only if the Abramoff scandal has little effect on those voters' loyalty. 
 In the meantime, the moderate elements of the Georgia Republican Party, who discouraged Mr. Reed's candidacy and have savored his disgrace, view this as an opportunity to regain lost ground. 
 ''There are more dynamics in this lieutenant governor's race than there are in any other race in the country,'' said Erick-Woods Erickson, a conservative blogger based in Macon, Ga., who has followed every nuance of the campaign, recently posting a copy of a letter giving Mr. Reed permission to put one yard sign in every Waffle House. ''There's 2008, there's right versus left, there's Christian right versus not-a-big-deal Christian.''
 In recent weeks, Mr. Reed's Republican opponent, a veteran state senator named Casey Cagle, edged ahead in both fund-raising and independent polls. Not counting the $500,000 that Mr. Reed has given his own campaign, he has raised $2.4 million to Mr. Cagle's $2.5 million. 
 Yet many political observers have cautioned that it would be a mistake to underestimate Mr. Reed, a former director of the Christian Coalition, who has kept his head down, refusing interviews and publicizing his appearances only to the faithful. ''He's going to have to pull a miracle out,'' said Matt Towery, a pollster who once ran for lieutenant governor. ''And I never bar that with Ralph.''
 On Thursday, Mr. Reed, wearing unscuffed cowboy boots and a star-studded belt buckle, surveyed the Cobb County event with confidence, noting that the county typically supplied 1 of every 10 Republican primary voters in the state. 
 ''This is Ralph Reed country right here,'' he told a reporter. In addition to endorsements from former Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat who has aligned himself with the conservative Christian movement, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, a presidential hopeful eager to improve his connections to religious conservatives, Mr. Reed claims to have 6,000 volunteers on the ground, including more than 70 home-schooled children from 10 states. 
 ''It will be the most effective, grass-roots, get-out-the-vote effort that this state has ever seen in a down-ballot campaign,'' Mr. Reed said. Mr. Cagle countered that he had broader support, including that of the business community and of most of the state's elected Republicans.
 The lobbying scandal is not an easy one to boil down to a 30-second spot. According to the charges against Mr. Abramoff, Indian tribes with casinos paid Mr. Reed to drum up religion-based anti-gambling sentiment against competing casinos, using Mr. Abramoff as a go-between. Mr. Reed now says he believed Mr. Abramoff's assurances that he was not being paid with gambling money. 
 ''Had I known then what I know now,'' he has said repeatedly, ''I would not have undertaken the work.''
 Yet e-mail messages released by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee make it clear that Mr. Reed knew who was paying him and suggest that he helped funnel the money through other entities to disguise its source. On Wednesday, a Texas Indian tribe filed suit against the lobbyist and four associates, including Mr. Reed, accusing them of ''greed, corruption and deceit.''
 Mr. Reed's critics seized on the scandal as proof that he had deployed his Christian supporters for profit. ''Ralph Reed sold out our values,'' Mr. Cagle's advertisements say, calling him ''hypocritical and immoral'' and accusing him of ''manipulating Christians for casinos.''
 They also cite a little-noted aspect of the link between Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Reed, saying Mr. Reed helped defend an economic system in the Northern Mariana Islands, a United States commonwealth not subject to minimum wage laws, that fostered exploitation of immigrant workers, particularly women. In one commercial, the words ''forced abortions'' appear next to a grinning Mr. Reed. Mr. Reed's campaign manager has called the link preposterous.
 Political analysts say the advertisements have pushed Mr. Reed's poll numbers down. His counterattacks -- citing, among other things, Mr. Cagle's $1,000 contribution to a Democrat and his simultaneous service on the Senate banking committee and the board of a bank -- have gained little traction, several said, and his defense has been slow and ineffective. 
 ''There's confusion among the Christian conservatives,'' Mr. Towery, the pollster, said. ''I'm not going to say Cagle's taking the base, but he's picking away at it.''
 In his latest advertisement, Mr. Reed points out that he has not been accused of a crime, adding: ''I've always worked for what we believe in: faith, family and freedom. That's why the liberal media has attacked me. Because I've stood for you and our conservative values.''
 The distant, convoluted nature of the Abramoff scandal cuts both ways in Georgia. On the one hand, it colors Mr. Reed with the taint of Washington. On the other, voters have only a vague notion of its substance. At the Cobb County rally, people variously referred to Mr. Abramoff as Abramson, Abraham and Abramnov.
 Doris Fowler, the woman in the red sweater, took the view that Mr. Abramoff had taken advantage of Mr. Reed. ''He started off as a good guy,'' Ms. Fowler said. ''He knew Ralph's sincerity, and he knew how Ralph hated gambling.''
 Cathy Finck, a project coordinator for a nonprofit organization, said that she was still undecided but that the scandal was not a big factor. ''That's too much politics and not enough issues for me,'' Ms. Finck said. ''I'm discounting it.''
 She said she was leaning toward Mr. Cagle because of his legislative experience. ''What I've listened carefully to candidates about is how different it is once you're down at the dome,'' she said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council, in Weakened Resolution, Demands End to North Korean Missile Program

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 15 

 BODY:
The Security Council condemned North Korea's missile launchings on Saturday and demanded that the country suspend its ballistic missile program, in a resolution that was weakened at the 11th hour to forestall a veto by China.
 All 15 members voted for the measure, which requires all countries to prevent North Korea from receiving or transferring missile-related items and ''strongly urges'' North Korea to abandon its nuclear program and return to the six-party talks on that program.
Japan and the United States, the principal sponsors of an original tougher draft, eliminated the main impediment to passage on Saturday by agreeing to drop language citing Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that expands the reach of sanctions and makes measures enforceable by armed action. 
 Still, John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, called the council's action ''unequivocal, unambiguous and unanimous.''
 North Korea's ambassador, Pak Gil Yon, told the members afterward that his country ''resolutely condemns the attempt of some countries to misuse the Security Council for the despicable political aim to isolate and put pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and totally rejects the resolution.''
 Mr. Pak then rose from the horseshoe-shaped panel and left the chamber, prompting Mr. Bolton to say: ''This has been a historic day. Not only have we unanimously adopted resolution 1695, but North Korea has set a world record in rejecting it 45 minutes after its adoption.''
 China and Russia wanted no mention of Chapter VII for fear that it could be used to justify military strikes on North Korea. Opposition by both countries to the Chapter VII rubric has grown since the war in Iraq and what Beijing and Moscow see as the Bush administration's resort to military means to remove governments it opposes. Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, had repeatedly said he would cast his country's veto if that reference remained.
 Mr. Bolton had insisted throughout the week that the resolution had to be adopted under Chapter VII to be binding, but on Friday night he shifted ground and said that it was mandatory that all Security Council resolutions be followed, regardless of whether the Chapter VII language were included.
 After the vote, he said, ''We look forward to North Korea's full, unconditional and immediate compliance with this Security Council resolution.''
 But he added that the Council had to be prepared that North Korea ''might choose a different path'' and in that event, he said, ''the United States and other member states have the opportunity at any point to return to the Council for further action.''
 Mr. Pak left little doubt that North Korea had no intention of complying, saying that it would continue with its missile program, which it considered essential to its self-defense.
 The Council members had struggled for days over how to produce a firm response to the seven missile firings that North Korea conducted on July 5 despite warnings from all the world powers, including its principal ally, China.
 Japan proposed the resolution on July 7, but agreed in the following days to put off a vote while China pursued a diplomatic solution through a high-level mission to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
 After the mission appeared to return empty-handed early this week, negotiations intensified, running day and night and involving Japan and the five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
 On July 11, China and Russia stymied pressure to move to a vote by introducing a rival draft that did not invoke Chapter VII nor include the kind of sanctions against North Korea that were in the original Japanese text.
 The action represented a compromise by the two countries, which earlier had insisted that a resolution was an overreaction and would destabilize the region further, and that a simple non-binding presidential statement would suffice.
 The Japanese, backed by the United States, insisted on a vote by Saturday to coincide with the opening of the summit meeting in St. Petersburg of the Group of 8 leaders. That meeting is expected to produce another statement on the North Korean test firings.
 All the versions of the resolution under discussion at the United Nations focused on the same objectives, but the debate centered on wording changes that are central to the drafting of United Nations resolutions.
 In exchange for dropping the critical reference to Chapter VII, for instance, the drafters gained a tougher text on the targeted sanctions sections. That was accomplished by simple word replacements, saying that the Council ''demands'' and ''requires,'' rather than ''decides,'' the stipulations for North Korea. By contrast, the softest of the texts, the one proposed by China and Russia, used ''calls upon'' and ''urges.''
 The earlier draft had called for the cessation of North Korea's development, testing, deployment and proliferation of ballistic missiles. But the final version dropped the specifics and substituted the words ''all activities' related to its missile program.
 Mr. Wang said that if the original resolution had gone through, it would have ''created enormous obstacles to the six-party talks and other diplomatic endeavors.''

HEADLINE: The 229th Legislative Session: A Blend of Accomplishment and Dysfunction

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 14 

 BODY:
If the 229th session of the New York State Legislature did little to dispel the notion that Albany is the nation's capital of governmental dysfunction, at least New Jersey's brief shutdown gave Empire State legislators some competition this year. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki's 12th and final regular legislative session actually showed that the importance of getting a budget finished on time might have been overrated. Because of Mr. Pataki's impending departure, this year was the last waltz for the triumvirate who have controlled the state for more than a decade: Mr. Pataki, a Republican; Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican (Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno, however, have indicated no intention of departing.)
For a second consecutive year, the governor and the Legislature got the budget done by its April 1 deadline, even though the governor was hospitalized for nearly three weeks in late winter after an appendectomy. But the outcome of the budget became complicated after Mr. Pataki claimed that many of his vetoes could not be overridden by the Legislature. In making that argument, he cited the expansive executive powers laid out in a 2004 court ruling that followed a legal battle with the Legislature. 
 With the threat of new legal challenges looming, both sides continued sparring over budget details. By late April, Mr. Pataki declared that ''the budget is over,'' while Mr. Bruno said, ''what I've learned in this business is it's not over until it's over.'' 
 With billions of dollars under negotiation and major programs hanging in the balance, including money for state hospitals and the creation of a new office to combat Medicaid fraud, it was not until June 23 that the budget was sorted out and the regular Legislative session ended, a day later than scheduled. 
 The robust spending increases, a lack of transparency in the budget-making process, and potentially costly giveaways to powerful interest groups, including labor unions, all came in for harsh criticism as the legislative session ended. And though lawmakers addressed many of the most contentious issues that divided them, some critics derided what they called Band-Aid solutions to pressing problems.
 Billions of dollars were allocated to pay for New York City school construction, an attempt to respond to the court ruling in a case brought by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the advocacy group that has challenged financing of city schools. But the case will continue to haunt Albany, because billions of dollars the court ordered for operating funds still have not been provided. The wrangling over school aid is complicated by divisions between the needs of upstate and downstate districts, as well as competing city, suburban and rural needs. 
 The sides also agreed to centralize Medicaid fraud fighting under a new office of an inspector general, though Republicans were able to block a proposal that would have allowed whistle-blower lawsuits. This move enraged Democrats, including Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the candidate for governor who is leading in polls. 
 And state leaders agreed in June on property tax relief worth $1.6 billion over two years. But the plan is still hitched to the much-maligned School Tax Relief program, known as STAR, and New York's overall tax burden is still among the nation's highest by some measures. 
 Some contentious social issues were left for next year, when the Legislature is expected to debate same-sex marriage in earnest after the courts ruled that it was up to lawmakers to deal with the issue. 

Budget
 After two decades of late budgets, lawmakers passed an on-time budget in March for the second year in a row, although significant elements of it were changed in the final deal reached with the governor in June. The $110.7 billion budget the governor proposed in January was countered with a legislative budget that increased spending by $2 billion to $3 billion above that, at least according to the Legislature. The governor and his staff said the legislative budget was actually a few billion dollars higher than lawmakers' estimates, and that it would significantly inflate future deficits. 
 Mr. Bruno said that the governor's staff ''ought to go back to kindergarten and learn how to count.'' Not to be outdone, Mr. Silver said, ''We're going to push a pre-K program so they'll be prepared for the Senate's kindergarten.'' 
 When the legislative session ended on June 23, lawmakers said their final deal with the governor left the state with a $113.4 billion budget. But on July 11, the office of Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a Democrat, said that the final budget was actually $114.7 billion, including federal funds, which he said represented spending growth of about 10 percent from the previous year's budget. Considering only state funds, spending rose 13 percent, close to four times the rate of inflation. 

Crime, Justice and Security

LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Requires that the names of more than 8,000 Level 2 sex offenders be available to the public on the Internet, in addition to the Level 3 offenders already listed. Level 3 offenders are deemed to have the highest risk of being repeat offenders. The legislation would also expand notification of Level 1 sex offenders in communities. 
 Toughens penalties for making a swastika on public property or on private property without an owner's consent, or for burning a cross in public view. 
 Eliminates the statute of limitations in first-degree rape cases and other Class B felonies, including first-degree aggravated sexual abuse and first-degree sexual conduct against a child. Also lengthens the statute of limitations in civil cases for serious sex crimes to five years from one year. 
 Expands the state's DNA collection to people convicted of all felonies and more than a dozen misdemeanors, including petty larceny. 
 Increases penalties for sexual assaults against children, in part by designating a new crime called Predatory Sexual Assault Against a Child. 
 Significantly increases the length of time sex offenders stay in the state's registry, requiring those deemed most dangerous to be permanently registered.

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would increase penalties for drivers who flee police officers. Passed by the Legislature after Craig J. Todeschini, a state trooper, was killed while pursuing a motorcyclist. 
 Would toughen penalties for drunken driving by creating the new crime classification of aggravated D.W.I. for drivers with a blood alcohol content of 0.18 or higher, and by requiring those convicted of the crime who are on probation for an earlier drunken driving offense to have special technology installed in their car that prevents driving while intoxicated. Also makes it easier to revoke the licenses of repeat offenders. 
 Would give Child Protective Services workers wider latitude to act when they learn of potential child abuse cases, including seeking family court orders to enable them to enter homes or to require a child be turned over. 
 Would prohibit solitary confinement of seriously mentally ill prisoners. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have created new criminal penalties aimed at stopping human trafficking, whether related to forced labor or prostitution.
 Would have moderated Rockefeller-era drug laws further by requiring treatment for defendants with drug addictions and easing sentences for nonviolent offenders convicted of low-level drug crimes. Would have increased sentences for major drug dealers. 
 Would have created new procedures for civil confinement of potentially dangerous sex offenders after they have completed their prison terms. 

Taxation

LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Increases property tax relief available under the School Tax Relief program, known as STAR, by $760 million in the first year and close to $1 billion in the second year. 
 Eliminates the so-called marriage penalty, a feature of the tax code that can increase tax bills for married couples. 
 Establishes a child tax credit for qualified parents of up to $330 for each child between the ages of 4 and 17. Credit is aimed at the lower and middle classes, with the amount depending on family income. 

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would make it easier for the state to collect tobacco taxes on cigarette sales on reservations to non-Indians in New York State. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have reinstated the tax on clothing and shoes under $110 and instead provided two designated weeks of sales tax breaks. The current sales tax break for clothing and shoe purchases of less than $110 remains in place. 

Economic Development

LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Creates a $1.2 billion incentive package to bring an Advanced Micro Devices semiconductor plant to Saratoga County. The plant is expected to create 1,200 jobs directly and many more through supplier and construction work. 
 Grants a $25 million incentive package to the Delphi Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year, to keep plants in western New York. 
 Creates the Restore New York's Communities Initiative, providing a capital appropriation of $300 million to the Urban Development Corporation for demolition or rehabilitation of blighted residential or commercial buildings in state municipalities. 

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would allocate $100 million to continue until June 30, 2007, a program that offers reduced-rate power to businesses. 
 Would extend and expand the tax credit available to film productions. 

Education

LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Under significant political pressure from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, lawmakers agreed to borrow $11.2 billion for construction of New York City schools. To this end, the state will issue $2.6 billion in bonds through the state's Dormitory Authority this year, with $1.8 billion going to the city's schools and the remaining money distributed to other districts. Lawmakers also agreed on a complicated financing plan to allow the city to borrow up $9.4 billon through the Transitional Finance Authority, with the state paying as much $4.7 billion to guarantee the new bonds. 
 Requires high schools to include information about the prevention and effects of shaken baby syndrome in parenting skills classes. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Just as the Legislature was wrapping up negotiations over the state budget, an appellate court directed the state to come up with a plan to send between $4.7 billion and $5.6 billion in basic operating aid to New York City schools. Lawmakers again did not come up with such a plan to revamp the education financing system across the state to comply with an earlier ruling by the state's highest court, which said that New York City students were being shortchanged. The case is expected to reach the highest court for a third time this fall. 
 Lawmakers did not agree on a plan that would have increased the statewide cap on charter schools to 250. This year, the state reached its limit of 100 charters statewide. The New York City Department of Education and charter school advocates pressed lawmakers to lift the cap this year, but despite last-minute pressure by the governor, the Assembly did not budge on its position of maintaining the cap. 
 Would have allowed college students to have their financial aid awards adjusted in the middle of the academic year if their family income changes. 

Energy and Environment

LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Caps the sales tax portion of the state's gasoline tax, reducing the overall tax by about four cents a gallon at current prices. The legislation also gives counties the option of cutting their portion of the sales tax, meaning the total tax reduction could reach eight or nine cents a gallon. 
 Offers tax credits to use alternative-fuel systems for home heating and credits for the fuel itself; directs the New York State Thruway Authority to draft a feasibility study and plan for installing alternative-fuel pumps at stations along the thruway, and carry out the plan. 
 Requires the State Department of Environmental Conservation to provide inspection reports of hazardous dams to local officials within 30 days. 

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would extend tax credits for the purchase of alternative-fuel vehicles, such as those that can run on ethanol blends or biodiesel, but would end the tax credit for hybrid cars. 
 Would require the state's fleet of diesel vehicles, or diesel vehicles used by contractors, to have the best available emissions technology and use low-sulfur diesel fuel. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have reinstated and changed the law related to choosing the location of new power plants to invite more community involvement, and upgraded emissions standards for the plants. Passed by the Assembly, but stalled in the Senate. 

Governance

LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Increases the percentage of public pension fund assets that can be invested in alternative investments, including hedge funds, to 25 percent from 15 percent. 

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would change the start of the fiscal year to May 1 from April 1 and require the governor and legislature to begin to discuss revenue forecasts and spending predictions by early December. The legislation would also establish an Independent Budget Office to analyze revenue and spending. The governor's office has indicated that he is likely to veto the legislation. 
 Would require the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to post all environmental permits on a searchable Web site.
 Would make it easier for members of the public to have their attorney's fees paid for if they succeed in freedom of information lawsuits. 
 Would require legislative approval before public authorities can create subsidiaries. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have created new legislation to reform the governance of public authorities. The legislation stalled after a dispute between the Assembly and the governor's office over the structure of a budget office to supervise authorities. 
 Would have banned gifts from lobbyists, made it harder for legislative staff members to become lobbyists, and required public officials to go through ethics training. 

Health and Social Services

ENACTED LEGISLATION
 Provides emergency prescription drug benefits under Medicaid to offset problems with coverage available under the federal government's new Medicare Part D program. Legislature overrode the governor's veto. 

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would allow the roughly 50,000 private providers of home day care services for children to collectively bargain with the state for benefits. Vetoed by the governor, but overridden by the Senate. Passed by the Assembly, awaiting possible override. 
 Would expand workers' compensation law to cover Lyme disease. 
 Would establish accidental-death benefit for public-sector employees who responded to the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Would create income tax credits of up to $10,000 for organ donors and a number of other measures aimed at encouraging organ donations. 
 Would require contractors and subcontractors on public works projects to inform workers of their right to receive prevailing wages. 
 Would grant female county workers up to four hours' yearly leave for breast cancer screenings. 
 Would increase the number of cases reviewed by local child fatality review boards, including those of children who have a case with Child Protective Services. Previously, only the deaths of children in the foster care system were reviewed.

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have allowed the state to pool its programs to purchase prescription drugs, a plan known as bulk purchasing, which advocates said would allow the state to negotiate lower prices for such medication. 
 Would have required insurance companies to cover most mental illnesses and to expand such coverage requirements for children. An agreement has been reached between the Assembly and the Senate, which may send legislation to the governor this year. 

Consumer Protection

LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Creates new laws related to identify theft. Includes the Security Freeze Law, which allows consumers to place a freeze on their credit report if they believe they are victims of identity theft. The Disposal of Personal Records Law requires businesses to dispose of records that contain personal information, with civil penalties of as much as $5,000 for failures to comply. The Anti-Phishing Act of 2006 prohibits, and lays out civil penalties for, luring e-mail users into providing information by posing as a legitimate enterprise, a practice which is known as phishing. 

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would ban ''modem hijacking,'' in which hackers infiltrate and make use of other people's modems, creating civil penalties and authorizing civil suits. 
 Would bar credit card issuers from increasing interest rates because a cardholder made late payments to other creditors. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have required drug companies to report gifts to doctors that are valued at more than $75, including trips, dinners or speaking fees. 

Miscellaneous

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would establish procedures to determine whether public employers have negotiated in good faith and, if the Public Employee Relations Board determines they have not, to penalize them by granting automatic wage increases. 
 Several other bills related to strengthening the hand of unions during contract negotiations also passed both houses. 
 Would allow beer sales on Sunday to start at 8 a.m. instead of at noon. 
 Would allow nonprofit museums to claim abandoned property, including artwork lent years ago but no longer claimed. Would establish rules for disposal of artwork for such museums, including requiring that proceeds be used for collections, not operating expenses.

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have expanded the five-cent bottle deposit to noncarbonated beverages, including bottled water. Supporters called it the ''bigger, better bottle bill.'' Detractors, including John Faso, a Republican candidate for governor, likened it to a tax. 
 Would have allowed no-fault divorce. 
 Would have legalized same-sex marriage in New York State; bills in the Assembly and Senate did not get out of committee. Recent Court of Appeals ruling deferred the issue to the Legislature, which will probably vote on the bills next year.

HEADLINE: Those Wild Budget Swings

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT was enough to make a supply-side, tax-cutting Republican beam with pride.
 Striding into the East Room on Tuesday morning, President Bush announced that tax revenues had been pouring in so fast this year that the federal deficit was likely to shrink for the second year in a row -- even though spending continued to balloon.
Tax revenue hasn't climbed this quickly since President Bill Clinton was in office. After plunging throughout Mr. Bush's first term, tax receipts are running 27 percent higher this year than in 2004 -- an added $500 billion. The White House now predicts that the budget deficit this year will be $296 billion, down from $318 billion in 2005 and $412 billion two years ago. 
 But the real news is not that tax revenues are particularly high; they are not. The big change is that tax revenues have become more of a crapshoot -- more volatile, more unpredictable and more buffeted by swings in the stock market than they were 10 years ago.
 Why? Because tax revenues are increasingly dependent on the fortunes of the very rich. 
 And it turns out that the rich are different from most other taxpayers. Much more of their income is tied, not to wages and salaries, but to the stock market and to executive bonuses, which can swing widely from year to year. 
 Relying on these gyrating tax revenues makes it harder to gauge the government's true fiscal health. Mistakes are easier to make, and long-term problems can be glossed over.
 At first blush, the recent jump in tax revenue would seem to validate Mr. Bush and those who believe that tax cuts ultimately generate higher tax revenues because they prompt people to work harder, invest more and take more entrepreneurial risk. 
 The White House, in a news release last week, boasted that tax revenues have climbed 34 percent since Congress passed Mr. Bush's second big tax cut -- which included a major reduction in taxes on stock dividends and capital gains. 
 But revenues are only up in comparison with how low they had plunged in recent years. Individual income taxes, the biggest component of federal revenue, are barely back to the level that was reached in 2000, $1 trillion. Adjusting for inflation, income tax revenue is still lower than six years ago.
 ''The idea that tax cuts have led to higher revenues is pernicious,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan research group that lobbies for fiscal discipline. ''Tax revenues may be higher, but they are not higher than they would have been if the tax cuts hadn't occurred.''
 But beyond the perennial debate about whether ''fiscal discipline'' means raising taxes or cutting spending, there is also an issue about the increasingly erratic pattern of the tax revenue itself. 
 The top 1 percent of taxpayers -- those who earn more than $300,000 a year -- provide about 30 percent of the federal government's individual income tax revenues. The top 10 percent of taxpayers -- those with incomes above $100,000 -- provide about two-thirds of income tax revenue. 
 The lopsided burden is partly a result of progressive taxation, and partly a result of widening income disparities between people at the top and bottom of the economic ladder.
 It's hard to imagine what the federal government could do to reduce instability. Because about 40 million people do not owe any federal income taxes, almost any attempt to broaden the tax base would shift more of the tax burden from the wealthy to middle-income households. Yet the more the rich bear the burden, the more they will seek to escape it.
 The unpredictable tax revenues first surfaced almost 10 years ago, as booming economic growth and the dot-com frenzy propelled the stock market to spectacular highs. The result was a tidal wave of tax revenue that far eclipsed projections by both the White House and the Congressional Budget Office. As if by magic, budget deficits disappeared and turned into surpluses. 
 For the most part, the Congressional forecasts missed the mark by less than 4 percent from 1982 until 1995. But starting in 1996, when the dot-com frenzy erupted in earnest, the agency began undershooting by as much as 9.5 percent. In 1996, tax revenues came in $93 billion higher than expected; in 1997, they were $163 billion higher; in 1999, they were $152 billion higher. 
 When the dot-com bubble popped in 2001, and the economy slid into a brief recession, tax revenues plunged $308 billion below what the Congressional Budget Office had predicted and remained depressed for the next three years.
 NOW the pendulum is swinging once again. Corporate tax payments, which plunged more than $70 billion from 2000 to 2003, could hit a new record of $332 billion this year. Capital gains taxes could climb back from a low of $50 billion in 2003 to $75 billion this year. 
 Few budget analysts would say the jump in revenues is bad news. But if the last decade is any indication, it would be foolish to count on more of the same. 
 The Bush administration has quietly acknowledged the point. Its latest estimate anticipates that tax revenues will be almost flat in 2007 and that the deficit will widen to $339 billion. 
 But only if things turn out as expected.

 Earlier today, President Bush announced that the federal deficit is actually $296 billion less than originally forecast. The president credits low unemployment, high job growth and the fact that he did the math himself.
 President Bush left for the G8 summit in Russia, and the White House says he's going to try to convince the other world leaders to develop nuclear power. Apparently, it's working, because so far Bush has convinced Iran and North Korea.

HEADLINE: A Second Chance on the West Side

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his economic development czar, Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff, have been trying since they took office to reclaim Manhattan's last large chunk of frontier, the rail yards west of Midtown. Their first effort was inglorious, tied to a long-shot bid for the Olympics and a commitment to build an ill-conceived football stadium for the Jets. Now the mayor and his deputy are asking New Yorkers to take a leap of faith that they can do it right the second time around.
 While the details are not yet spelled out, the new plan is impressive and bold. It proposes that the city buy the undeveloped tract where the stadium would have been from its owner, the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Having failed to seek local input on the stadium project, Mr. Bloomberg promises to work with the City Council and local residents to find the best use for the property. This could animate a real vision for the area. 
Critics have challenged the city's bid, calling it too low for the 13-acre western yard parcel -- $300 million, paid out of the capital fund, along with another $200 million and a share of future revenues for a portion of the air rights over an eastern part of the yards. The $300 million is $50 million above the Jets' last offer but far less than an appraised value approaching $1 billion. The cash-strapped M.T.A., which runs the subway and bus system, deserves the best possible price; an open auction is arguably the best way to do that. 
 Still, the city's plan provides compelling advantages. The biggest problem with the Jets plan was that a hulking stadium was not the best use of an area that should be the keystone to development of the far West Side. If the city buys the land, it will be in a much stronger position to determine what goes there, which almost everyone agrees should be a mixed use development, along with parks that would open up more of the waterfront to the public.
 The city's hopes for the area are tied to extending the No. 7 subway line, which it intends to underwrite to the tune of about $2 billion. We think the M.T.A. should pay for the extension, since it will get the revenue from increased ridership. But there is no question that the city -- if it can secure financing against future revenues from development -- can get the job done much quicker. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has always viewed development of the far West Side of Midtown Manhattan as his potential legacy. The basic idea of extending the No. 7 subway to serve the area, and then creating a mix of market-price and affordable housing, offices and green space has always seemed sound. The question mark that remains involves financing -- whether the city can make enough money from the air rights and other revenues to carry its commitments, including the new subway line. 
 Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Doctoroff need to share more of this with the public. They seem to have won over Christine Quinn, the City Council Speaker, who was a vocal opponent of the stadium plan. Ms. Quinn's endorsement of the overall vision is important, but she and the rest of the council need to stay on top of the financing question. 
 There are other pieces to the revitalization of the West Side. One is the plan to build a railway station in the old post office building on Eighth Avenue, possibly in conjuction with a new Madison Square Garden. Another is the state's proposal to expand the Javits Convention Center. That plan is far from perfect and its developers need to give more attention to providing waterfront access at the site, which under the plan would essentially block pedestrians for a five-block stretch from 34th to 39th streets.
 Mr. Bloomberg is understandably eager to jump-start redevelopment. He has less than four years to put his mark on the project. And the city political scene is fraught with pitfalls -- among them the competing demands of development in Lower Manhattan and the insecurity that comes with soon-to-change administrations in Albany. But his sense of urgency should not stop officials from taking a careful look at all the financial implications of the deal before committing themselves.

HEADLINE: Rare Tornado Snaps Trees and Power Lines

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN; Anahad O'Connor contributed reporting from Westchester for this article.

 BODY:
A reported tornado took central Connecticut and Westchester County by surprise on Wednesday afternoon, appearing suddenly over the Hudson River and carving a narrow path of destruction through backcountry Greenwich and several towns in Westchester.
 The tornado emerged over the Hudson shortly before 4 p.m. and quickly moved east, snapping and sheering trees along the way, knocking down trees, power lines and damaging cars. On Dwight Lane in Greenwich, the wind did so much damage that crews from Connecticut Light and Power worked Thursday to clear away 400 feet of downed trees to get to three broken poles and restore power, said Mitch Gross, a spokesman for the company. The storm knocked out power to about 1,700 customers.
No injuries were reported and no homes were damaged in Greenwich, said Lt. Daniel Allen, a spokesman for the Greenwich Police Department. The destruction was concentrated in the northwest corner of town, he said. One car was damaged by a tree, Lieutenant Allen said, and about a half-dozen roads were blocked Wednesday. 
 The last tornados to hit Connecticut were in June 2002, in Litchfield and New London Counties, according to Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.
 Westchester was hit harder. Buildings were damaged and four people were injured and taken to hospitals, but none were hurt seriously. 
 All along highways and roads in the towns that were hit, hundreds of downed trees created hurdles, and countless power lines littered the ground, in some cases in flames. Dozens of businesses were damaged.
 ''Some of these buildings are just wide open,'' said Louis Alagno, the police chief of Mount Pleasant, N.Y. ''There are so many walls gone that you can literally walk right into these buildings.''

State Extends Ban Of Sewage in Sound
 For years, Connecticut has banned raw sewage from being dumped in Long Island Sound. Now, in a continuing effort to restore the health of the Sound, the state is extending its ban on treated sewage.
 In an order announced on Wednesday, Gov. M. Jodi Rell said that boaters could no longer discharge treated sewage into the Sound from Guilford to Groton. This is the third section of the coastline where the state has banned treated sewage. It had already been banned from Groton to Stonington and then from Stonington to the Rhode Island border. The effort began in 2003.
 The state has applied to the federal Environmental Protection Agency to designate all of Connecticut's coast as a ''no-discharge area,'' but is still awaiting a decision. State officials said they expected that the rest of the Sound would be protected from all sewage by next spring.
 ''Robert W. Varney, regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency in New England, said the designation would result in ''substantial water quality improvements in the waters all along the Sound.''
 To be approved for a ban on treated sewage in a particular area, the state must show it has enough pump-out stations where boaters can clear their sewage. The state already has dozens of such stations. 
 Dennis Schain, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said that while treated sewage was not as bad as raw sewage, it still damages the waters and removing it was important to the Sound's long-term health. Boaters caught dumping treated sewage will be subject to fines, he said.

Norwalk Keeps Airline But at a Different Site
 Virgin Atlantic Airlines, which had been poised to move its North American headquarters to Stamford from Norwalk, changed course last week. Instead the company announced that it would move to another site in Norwalk.
 The airline said in January that it planned to sign a lease for a building on Atlantic Street in Stamford. But delays in getting the development ready caused a change in plans, said Brooke Lawer, a spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic. The company had hoped to move in the fall of this year, but might have to wait at least another year, she said.
 ''There were significant delays that we had not been expecting,'' Ms. Lawer said.
 The company will receive incentives for remaining in Norwalk, including tax abatements and reduced parking fees, said Tad Diesel, director of marketing and business development for Norwalk.
 Virgin Atlantic is moving out of its 60,000-square-foot Belden Street office because it is too large. The company transferred some jobs to England and had some workers telecommute from home last fall, reducing the number of employees in its Norwalk office to 85 from 185, Ms. Lawer said.
 The new office, in a new development on Water Street near the train station in South Norwalk, is about 16,000 square feet, she said. The company announced it would sign a 15-year lease on the property, with plans to move in at the beginning of next year.
 When they heard that Virgin Atlantic executives were considering other locations, Norwalk officials met with them and emphasized the economic benefits of staying in the city, Mayor Richard Moccia said. 
 ''We try to put the best economic package together to keep people here,'' he said. 
 Michael W. Freimuth, the director of Stamford's Office of Economic Development, could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: In Hezbollah Mix of Politics and Arms, Arms Win Out

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR and HASSAN M. FATTAH

 BODY:
Just over a year ago, after the ejection of Syrian forces from Lebanon, the militant Shiite group Hezbollah found itself at a crossroads. On one hand, it seemed to be casting its lot with Lebanese politics, as its candidates struck an alliance with Christians and joined the Lebanese cabinet. Some even pointed to Hezbollah as a model for how a rogue militia can be co-opted and turned away from lawlessness. 
 On the other hand, Hezbollah clung to its weapons. Some believed it was biding its time, allying its interests with its sponsors in Iran and Syria.
 With its cross-border attack on Israel last week, Hezbollah apparently made its choice. 
 Israel's shelling of Gaza provided Hezbollah with an opportunity to show solidarity with its Islamic brethren there. 
 But analysts pointed to other motives. Hezbollah needs to reassert its right to maintain its own heavily armed militia against ever louder domestic calls for its disarmament, and its actions burnish its backers, Iran and Syria, as they face Western attempts to combat and isolate them. 
 There is precedent for specific cooperation between Hamas, the Palestinian group whose exiled leader lives in Syria, and Hezbollah. In 2004, the two groups concluded an agreement to work closely to attack Israel more often. 
 This week's fighting also signals that Hezbollah and its allies are girding for a longer-term confrontation. Hezbollah sees a joint American-Israeli attempt to reshape the region in the Western image, through the invasion of Iraq and the emphasis on democracy, and is determined to block it by asserting the supremacy of Islam. 
 Here Hezbollah's move serves the interest of Iran and Syria. Their relationship is so opaque that few would suggest that Syria or Iran can issue direct orders to Hezbollah. But the links are strong, with Iran providing substantial financial assistance and weapons, while Syria provides logistical help as well as political backing. 
 Since Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 first spawned Hezbollah, or The Party of God, it has set out to prove that adherence to Islam alone will allow Arabs to prevail. Hezbollah used zealots who re-introduced the medieval practice of suicide attacks to the region. It attacked American marines in Beirut, prompting the withdrawal of American forces in the early 1980's, and eventually forced Israel to end its 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000. 
 After that, Hezbollah adopted a more public stance in support of the Palestinians as a way of keeping its militant credentials polished. Soon after the second uprising began against Israel in the occupied territories in September 2000, Hezbollah staged a cross-border raid to seize soldiers that eventually led to protracted hostage negotiations.
 There are believed to be up to 3,500 active Hezbollah supporters, including some 300 hard-core guerrillas trained under the auspices of Iran's Revolutionary Guards who have maintained a presence in Lebanon almost since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.
 Hezbollah virtually controls a swath of southern Lebanon, and the shadow of Iran looms large. In town after town in the south, the streets are hung with banners showing the pantheon of Iran's ruling ayatollahs. With generous backing from Iran, the group has financed a network of clinics, schools, farms, a construction company and myriad welfare organizations serving Lebanon's generally downtrodden Shiites. 
 Intelligence estimates drawn from recent Congressional testimony suggest that Iran subsidizes Hezbollah with $100 million to $200 million annually. But Hezbollah has also come to rely on financial support from Shiite expatriates in the West. Those funds far outweigh what comes from Iran, said Timur Goksel, a lecturer at the American University in Beirut who spent 20 years working in southern Lebanon as a United Nations official. 
 Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, asserted in a May 2005 speech that Hezbollah had more than 12,000 rockets, all of which were believed to be various forms of Katyushas provided by Iran. That coincides with estimates by Israeli and Western officials. 
 Until now, Hezbollah limited itself to using rockets with a range of 12 miles, but for the past several years Israeli officials have warned that Iran had provided more serious systems, including the 240-millimeter Fajr-3 missile, with a range of about 25 miles, and the 333-millimeter Fajr-5 missile, with a range of about 45 miles. The Fajr-5 could reach the northern Israeli city of Haifa and areas even farther south. On Thursday, Hezbollah-backed Al Manar TV broadcast images of the new long-range missiles. It is unclear how many Hezbollah might have. 
 The conflict with Israel has shown off Hezbollah's new armory. Sheik Nasrallah, in a recording, announced that Hezbollah had used a makeshift drone to attack an Israeli warship off the coast of Beirut, killing an Israeli sailor; the Israeli Army said it was a missile provided by Iran. And early on Saturday, the group apparently struck Tiberius, deep inside Israel. 
 The use of the longer-range rockets has led many regional experts to conclude that Iran gave at least tacit approval for the current clash -- and it was not just a few rogue Revolutionary Guard advisers in southern Lebanon who decided to let rip with more powerful weapons. 
 ''Would Hezbollah use a sophisticated missile that can hit Haifa without permission from Iran?'' said Prof. Abbas Milani, chairman of Iranian studies at Stanford University. ''I doubt it.'' 
 Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, went out of his way to announce that any Israeli attack on Syria would be considered an attack on the entire Muslim world, which is another sign of at least a confluence of interests, if not outright cooperation among the three. In a speech in Tehran on Saturday, he also compared Israel's rationale for military action to the kind of ''pretext'' Hitler used to attack Jews. 
 Syria and Iran have an interest in proving that they are important regional players who cannot be pushed around, and having Hezbollah cause trouble in northern Israel is the most direct way of doing that, regional experts said. 
 Mr. Milani says there is a connection with the tussle over Iran's nuclear ambitions, now that China and Russia have suggested they might support referring the issue to the United Nations Security Council. Iran has never made a secret of its support for Hezbollah, and in recent months boasted to visiting academics about providing it with missiles. 
 The Iranians ''have been very clear that if push comes to shove, if the West tries to push them, tries to get tough with them, they can get tough back,'' said Mr. Milani. ''They don't want to sit and wait. They want to show the West that there is a cost for moving against Iran.''
 As for the Syrians, President Bashar Assad appears to be sticking to his father's playbook. Whenever Hafez Assad, who died in 2000, sensed that as president he was being marginalized or ignored, he managed to stir up trouble in neighboring Lebanon so that the great powers would come knocking. 
 Other Sunni Arab governments fear an attempt by Iran to burnish its credentials in the region, reaching beyond its Shiite base to forge common ties with Sunnis. They see common goals binding Iran, radical Shiite parties in Iraq, the Assad government in Syria and Hezbollah and Hamas, who all oppose the West and its allies in the Middle East. 
 ''This axis is trying to establish predominance over Arab public opinion and eventually expand its influence into other Arab countries,'' said one Lebanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he said it was impossible to publicly criticize Hezbollah when the country is under attack from Israel. ''They have already reached out to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.''
 Hezbollah's more pronounced alignment with the Palestinian cause in the last six years has helped to provide the region's Shiites and Sunnis with a common goal, although deep suspicions remain. 
 One sector seemingly horrified by the attempt to exhibit a more assertive Islamic and Shiite presence in the region is in traditional Sunni states and Western allies like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. 
 Jamal Dajani, who creates English translations of Arabic news shows for a program called Mosaic on Link TV, spends every day monitoring bulletins from around the Arab world. 
 While the satellite channels were providing around-the-clock coverage of the crisis on Friday, he said, it was business as usual on the state-run channels, with soap operas and game shows running uninterrupted by any news bulletins from Lebanon or Gaza. The Saudi government also put out an unusual statement condemning Hezbollah's actions as ''uncalculated adventures.''
 Sheik Nasrallah responded, showing just how Hezbollah, with its activist stance against Israel, manages to capture the imagination of an Arab public longing for anybody who will confront Israel and in the process claim a religious mantle that none of the other governments can come close to matching. 
 ''And for the Arab governments, I will not ask you for your history,'' Sheik Nasrallah said, mockingly. ''We in Hezbollah are adventurers, yes, and we have been adventurers since 1982. We did not bring to our country but victory, freedom, liberation, honor and dignity, with our heads held high.''
 The open question is whether Hezbollah has miscalculated, underestimating the ferocity of Israel's response. 
 That may prompt a backlash against Hezbollah in Lebanon -- or, if Lebanese casualties mount, may bolster its credentials as a fighter against Israel. 
 But Sheik Nasrallah is shrewdly rallying the faithful by evoking his party's claim to a holy mandate. ''You are fighting the sons of Muhammad and Ali and Hassan and Hussein and all the prophet's household,'' he told the Israelis in a recorded message broadcast on the group's satellite television station, Al Manar, and on several Arab satellite news stations. 
 The sheik's black turban in his picture onscreen signaled his own descent from the Prophet Muhammad. ''You are fighting people who have faith,'' he said. 
 Analysts noted his skillful use of religious imagery. ''Hezbollah has not used that language in a very long time,'' said Amal Saad Ghorayeb, a professor of political science at Lebanese American University and an expert on Hezbollah. ''It's a form of psychological warfare against the Israelis.''
 Although Hezbollah has been integrated into the Lebanese political system, he had to remind them that Hezbollah is a regional player and an Islamic organization whose members are driven by a jihadi ideology, by a sacrificial ideology and ''they don't give a damn about the consequences.'' 
 Sheik Nasrallah's language plays into the Shiite tradition of being underdogs battling far more potent forces. Ali, Muhammad's son-in-law, and Hussein and Hassan, his grandsons, were all slaughtered by larger Muslim armies in what is now Iraq. Those battles gave birth to the Shiite branch of the faith and inspired its cult of martyrdom.
 In Lebanon itself, Hezbollah's growing military and political power has frightened and angered Lebanon's other sects. But it can play on Lebanese anger against Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon for 18 years. 
 ''The problem for non-Shiite Lebanese has been Hezbollah's weapons,'' Ms. Ghorayeb said. ''The problem for Hezbollah is the Israeli occupation. By now, people have realized that while Hezbollah got us into this, it is Israel that is our enemy.''
 As the siege of Lebanon entered its fourth day on Saturday, Hezbollah's radio and television appealed to Muslims outside Lebanon with reminders of past victories, and anthems speaking of ''usurped'' land. But the group also sought to address growing frustration on the ground, emphasizing that the battle with Israel could only be won through sacrifice. 
 ''Lebanon with its martyrs is victorious,'' one video clip broadcast on Al Manar television announced. On Nour Radio, an announcer reminded listeners that ''the patient one is the victor.''
 Hezbollah's actions this week defy the very central government of which it is a part. In Lebanon, analysts say, Hezbollah's main priority is to maintain the weapons that gave birth to it, while also taking over the local franchise for pushing Syrian interests after Syria was forced to withdraw its forces last year in the wake of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri's assassination.
 ''It has become the essential instrument of Syrian maneuvers to prevent the Lebanese state from adapting to its newfound independence,'' said Waddah Sharara, a sociology professor at the Lebanese University. 
 Thus it used its cabinet positions as well as its 13 deputies in Parliament to help block any attempts to remove President Emile Lahoud, widely considered a Syrian stooge; it undermined attempts to force Syria to demarcate the border and exchange ambassadors and it blocked economic aid that would have hinged on eliminating hundreds of patronage jobs. 
 Even as thousands gathered in anti-Syrian demonstrations last year, Hezbollah set up its own pro-Syrian rallies and served as a spoiler. With the Syrians now gone, Lebanese politicians, driven in part by foreign pressure about Hezbollah, have been more concerned about Hezbollah's potential to wreak havoc with its arms than with its ties to Syria. 
 Lebanese officials say the violence of Israel's response will likely give Hezbollah the opportunity to argue with renewed vigor that it should be allowed to keep its weapons to be able to respond to any Israeli attacks. 
 ''We will not stop the resistance,'' said Hussein Haj Hassan, a Hezbollah member of Parliament in Labanon. ''We will not release them'' he said, referring to captured Israeli soldiers, ''until there is an equitable solution and we have no apologies. What is needed now is for the loss of life to be stopped.''
 But some analysts expect Hezbollah to pay a heavy price on the ground once the dust settles. ''There is a huge split in the Lebanese street that is hurting Hezbollah's interests,'' said Hazim Amin, a Shiite columnist with the pan-Arab daily Al Hayat. ''More than half the street is not happy with what Hezbollah did and that is only going to increase, and they will have to answer to that.''

Israel Expands Assault's Reach
Israel expanded its reach to northern Lebanon, conducting airstrikes against coastal radar installations it said were targeting its warships. It also struck roads in the north an east of the country, with one attack killing at least 16 civilians, most of them children. And Hezbollah forces continued their rocket barrage into northern Israel. 1

The raid into Israel from southern Lebanon by the Shiite militia group Hezbollah has provided the new government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert a deeper political consensus, allowing him to prosecute a war that is widely supported by the Israeli people. 
 1

After Syria withdrew from Lebanon, Hezbollah found itself at a crossroads, between joining Lebanese politics and clinging to its militia. With its attack on Israel, Hezbollah seems to have made its choice. 1

U.N. Decries Missile Tests
The United Nations Security Council condemned North Korea's missile launches and demanded that Pyongyang suspend its ballistic missile program in a resolution that was weakened at the 11th hour to forestall a veto by China. 8

Frustration at Trade Talks
After face-to-face meetings preceding the annual meeting of the world's largest economic powers, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin said they failed to come to an agreement on giving Russia accession to the World Trade Organization, leaving Mr. Putin frustrated. 1

Raid on Iraqi Olympic Meeting
About 60 masked gunmen wearing government-style camouflage uniforms stormed a meeting of the National Olympic Committee of Iraq and the country's top sports administrators, abducting at least 30 people, including the Olympic committee chairman, the police said. One of the president's bodyguards was killed. 12

HEADLINE: The Finance Crowd Has Its Time in the Idaho Sun

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

DATELINE: SUN VALLEY, Idaho 

 BODY:
THE annual mogul-fest that Allen & Company holds here every year is best known for A-list attendees like Rupert Murdoch of the News Corporation, Richard D. Parsons of Time Warner, Howard Stringer of Sony and Sumner M. Redstone of Viacom.
 It is a conference that has taken on an almost supernatural reputation for deal making amid barbecues, discussion panels and whitewater rafting. (The seeds of Walt Disney's acquisition of ABC/Capital Cities in 1996 were sown here.) But this year, the ones to watch were deep-pocketed people you may have never heard of, from the world of private equity and hedge funds.
''I walked into dinner last night and didn't recognize three-quarters of the people there,'' said the chief executive of one of the world's largest media companies, who refused to speak on the record for fear of upsetting Herbert A. Allen of Allen & Company, who frowns on attendees talking publicly about the invitation-only conference, which ended yesterday. ''It was all these hedge fund and finance guys I had never met before. The balance of power is shifting.'' 
 The guest list at Mr. Allen's conference, which began in 1982, may be the ultimate barometer of where the center of influence lies in corporate America and on Wall Street. For most of the 1980's and early 90's, the power players were Hollywood studio moguls like Barry Diller, then of Paramount, and Michael D. Eisner, formerly of Disney. By the mid-1990's, cable and telecommunications executives like John C. Malone of Liberty Media and Brian L. Roberts of Comcast became the belles of the ball. In the late 1990's and early 2000's, technology and Internet executives like Stephen M. Case, the founder of America Online, and Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo, were drawing crowds at the hotel bar. 
 Now, flush with billions in cash and the ability to borrow heavily on top of that, the private equity bigwigs and hedge fund managers have become the stars. Call it Predators' Ball 2.0 -- a kind of outdoorsy reprise of Michael Milken's famous gathering of leveraged-buyout mavens of the 1980's. 
 ''We used to come here every year to sniff each other,'' said the chief executive of another media company, who also did not want his name used. ''Now, all these finance people are sniffing us.'' With media stocks down virtually across the board, some may smell opportunity.
 James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase, who has financed many of the largest corporate takeovers, seemed to be paying more attention than usual to the leveraged-buyout set this year.
 Among the private equity players invited this year were Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (who did not attend); John A. Canning Jr., chairman and chief executive of Madison Dearborn Partners; Stephen Pagliuca of Bain Capital; Jonathan M. Nelson of Providence Equity Partners; Timothy C. Collins, chief executive of Ripplewood Holdings; and William E. Ford, president of General Atlantic. Invitees from the hedge fund industry included Wesley R. Edens of the Fortress Investment Group; Sanford J. Colen of Apex Capital; John Griffin of Blue Ridge Capital; and Daniel Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management. 
 And then there were the famed money managers like Mario J. Gabelli of Gamco Investors and Bill Miller of Legg Mason. In an age of increasing shareholder activism, such prominent institutional investors have greater influence as well. In case you were wondering, Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire financier who jousted with Time Warner earlier this year, didn't get an invitation.
 Many of these investors have been to Sun Valley before, but they are grabbing more attention as their stature has grown. Even Larry Page, the Google co-founder who enjoyed rock-star treatment at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, seemed to have reverted to regular-guy status in Sun Valley -- as regular as you can be with billions of dollars of Google stock.
 Mr. Nelson of Providence, at the conference for his second year, seemed to be buttonholed by nearly every media mogul for a walk around the grounds or a chat by the duck pond. His firm, which focuses on the media sector, is an investor with several other private equity firms in businesses like Warner Music and MGM. Most recently, it was part of the winning consortium in the auction for the Spanish-language broadcaster Univision. 
 The Univision consortium also includes the media magnate -- and Sun Valley attendee -- Haim Saban, who made his fortune selling Fox Family to Disney after brokering the deal at an earlier Allen conference. At this year's event, the winning consortium spent much of the week in meetings with representatives of Grupo Televisa, the losing bidder for Univision, to discuss Televisa's plans for its stake in Univision.
 Other investors, like Mr. Och, Mr. Miller or Mr. Nevo -- whose firm is the largest investor in Time Warner -- were spotted throughout the conference hobnobbing with the likes of Robert S. Wiesenthal, the chief financial officer of the Sony Corporation of America, and Harvey Weinstein of the Weinstein Company.
 What are all these money men looking for? ''Any opportunity to put our money to work -- financing movies, new technologies, special projects and buyouts,'' said one hedge fund/quasi-private equity fund manager. 
 After leaving Miramax, Mr. Weinstein turned to hedge funds for much of the financing for his new company. Last week, Mr. Weinstein and Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television, announced here that they were forming a joint venture to produce films for urban audiences. That means they are likely to be in the market for more financing.
 THIS year's gathering continued to feed speculation about media deals, this time with private equity (that is, when attendees weren't talking about Mr. Murdoch's hair, newly dyed a youthful brown). 
 Leslie Moonves of CBS is expected to sell his company's Simon & Schuster book division -- or possibly even its Infinity radio division. Both have the hallmarks of a tempting buyout target: steady cash flow that can be easily leveraged. There was renewed chatter about Time Warner's AOL unit, a cash cow that is quickly deteriorating, after news that the company is (again) considering a range of possible strategies. 
 Other properties that inspired crystal-ball-gazing were some of Viacom's cable assets, since the business has not been performing as well as expected since its split with CBS. Also floating through the mountain air was the perpetual rumor about a buyout of EchoStar, the satellite television company owned by Charles W. Ergen, who also attended the conference. 
 With their ample supply of cash and newfound celebrity at Sun Valley, private equity and hedge fund professionals may want to enjoy their time in the Idaho sun while they can. Next year, depending on how the buyout market turns, many of them could discover that they are off the list.

HEADLINE: AS TENSIONS RISE, U.S. AND MOSCOW FALTER ON TRADE 

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and ANDREW E. KRAMER; C. J. Chivers contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: STRELNA, Russia, Sunday, July 16 

 BODY:
President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin announced that they had failed to come to an agreement on Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization, and aides said the deal, which had been expected as early as this weekend, was not likely for months.
 At a news conference that offered a somewhat rocky prelude to the annual summit meeting of the Group of 8 economic powers, Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush also differed over Iraq, the state of Russia's democracy and Israel's military campaign in Lebanon.
Though they had a few positive announcements as well -- agreeing on initiatives to combat nuclear terrorism and share civilian nuclear material and technology -- overall the appearance highlighted growing tensions between former cold war rivals now jockeying for global position.
 In the sharpest exchange, Mr. Bush said he had told Mr. Putin during a private dinner here Friday night about ''my desire to promote institutional change in parts of the world like Iraq -- where there is a free press and free religion -- and I told him that a lot of people in our country would hope Russia would do the same thing.'' 
 Mr. Putin, standing bolt upright in a dark blue suit, responded dryly, ''We certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in Iraq, I will tell you quite honestly'' -- a clear dig at the challenges still facing the American-supported government there. Mr. Bush, in a light blue suit and standing more casually than his counterpart, turned to face Mr. Putin, smiled and said, almost to himself, ''Just wait.''
 Both men played down any friction, saying it was indicative of a frank relationship that remains friendly in spite of the areas where their national interests diverge. 
 Russia, the host of the Group of 8 summit meeting for the first time, has set an agenda seeking common cause on protecting energy supplies and developing new ones, improving national education systems and combating infectious disease. But exchanges of military fire between Israel and Hezbollah intruded, and an agreement was reached even before the meeting that the attending nations would draft some sort of joint position intended to head off a broader regional conflict. 
 All sides expected some tension between the United States, which has expressed support for Israel's need to defend itself, and many of the other participating countries, whose leaders have deemed Israel's force excessive and have called for a cease-fire. The leaders also are to discuss the dual nuclear threats in Iran and North Korea.
 Mr. Putin had hoped to kick off the summit meeting, to begin Sunday at the palace erected by Peter the Great nearly 300 years ago in this St. Petersburg suburb, with an announcement that the United States would lift its objection to Russia's accession into the World Trade Organization. Mr. Putin wants membership as a symbol of the new position of Russia, flush with oil money, in the global economy. 
 Negotiations between Russian and American trade representatives went into the early morning on Saturday, but could not break through impasses over financial services, food imports and, to a lesser extent, intellectual property rights. 
 ''We're tough negotiators,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that the United States wanted to ensure a deal is reached that Congress will approve. He added that the two sides were close and that news reports had wrongly inflated expectations.
 In a briefing that followed the joint appearance by the two presidents, the United States trade representative, Susan Schwab, said it would probably be months before agreement could be reached. Asked if Russia had been correct to believe that a breakthrough was possible by this weekend, Ms. Schwab, who had been involved in the negotiations, said, ''I think both sides would have preferred if we had an agreement.''
 Her Russian counterparts blamed the United States, complaining in interviews that the sticking points revolved largely around what they considered the small issue of food imports, and the American side's objection to having Russian inspectors visit farms in the United States.
 But Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin agreed to start talks to pave the way for a deal allowing nuclear waste generated from American-produced plutonium from around the world to be stored in Russia -- a potential shift in American policy that would be lucrative for Russia. The United States would gain access to Russian uranium. They also agreed to combat the potential spread of nuclear materials to terrorists, a sign that the onetime nuclear rivals now see a common foe in extremists who have made both nations their targets.
 Russia analysts called those agreements significant. Graham Allison, a nuclear expert at Harvard who is here monitoring the talks, said the nuclear agreements could have a serious impact in limiting the possibility for rogue states to develop nuclear weapons. ''It's the beginning of something real,'' he said. 
 Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush offered no breakthroughs on a common approach to reining in the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran; the United States has been calling for a tougher line, while Russia has been advocating a more delicate approach.
 Mr. Putin, whose government's cooperation with Iran has rankled the White House, repeatedly referred to the Iranians as ''our partners.'' 
 When a reporter asked a two-part question about whether there were any breakthroughs in countering nuclear proliferation and how he rated the state of United States-Russian relations, Mr. Putin began, ''We will not participate in any crusades, in any holy alliances,'' which analysts here took as a signal to Iran that Russia was not fully aligned with Mr. Bush, or as a dig at Mr. Bush's campaign to spread democracy in the Middle East, or both. 
 But Mr. Putin continued, ''Our common goal is to make the world a more secure place, and certainly we'll be working with all our partners, including the United States, in order to address this problem.''
 Asked what he took Mr. Putin to have meant by ''holy alliance'' and ''crusade,'' Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, said during a news briefing here, ''You know, I asked myself the same question.''
 Mr. Hadley said the president did not specifically broach the subject that most severely divides the leaders in their approach to Iran: the potential imposition of sanctions if it does not give up its nuclear ambitions. Mr. Putin had sidestepped the question of sanctions.
 Yet, the Russian leader emphasized the need for cooperation as the G-8 meetings begin.
 ''If we elaborate common approaches to this difficult problem, we will see to it that our joint decisions are fulfilled,'' Mr. Putin said. ''This is what we said honestly and directly to our Iranian partners.''
 Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush agreed that Hezbollah was the provocateur in the escalating crisis in the Middle East. ''I agree with the premise that it is absolutely unacceptable to try and reach this or that goal,'' Mr. Putin said, ''through abductions, through carrying out strikes against an independent state from the territory of another state.''
 Mr. Putin went on to chide Israel. ''At the same time, we work under the assumption that the use of force should be balanced,'' he said. ''Escalation of violence, in our opinion, will not yield positive results.''
 In contrast, Mr. Bush declined to criticize Israel, saying firmly: ''In my judgment, the best way to stop the violence is to understand why the violence occurred in the first place. And that's because Hezbollah has been launching rocket attacks out of Lebanon into Israel.'' He blamed Syria for supporting Hezbollah and called upon its leadership to intervene.
 Pressed at a late-night news conference on his stance on Israel, Mr. Putin said he wished the conflict could be resolved by peaceful means. The Russians, he said, ''do get the impression that the aims of Israeli go beyond just recovering their kidnapped soldiers,'' according to a translator. He did not elaborate. Both leaders said their relationship was stronger than many acknowledge. 
 ''We've got people in Russia questioning U.S. motives, people in America questioning Russian motives,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But that's what happens when you have -- when you're big nations that have got influence, where you've got leaders willing to make tough decisions.''
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin's joint appearance came after a much friendlier social call the evening before, when the first couples had a private dinner at the palace.
 Both men indicated that though it was supposed to be a social call, the conversation veered into more serious matters, and Mr. Bush said they discussed their governing philosophies. ''I don't expect Russia to look like the United States,'' Mr. Bush said. ''As Vladimir pointedly reminded me last night, we have a different history, different traditions.''
 Meanwhile, in downtown St. Petersburg, protesters criticized both men. At one end of Nevsky Prospekt, the city's historic main boulevard, protesters gathered, chanting, ''We need another Russia and Russia without Putin.'' Some held signs denouncing the United States and the NATO expansion it backs. 
 As the demonstrators tried to march, lines of riot police officers moved in. Wearing helmets and some with shields, they beat several young men and dragged them away to waiting buses. The first two men arrested were punched by plainclothes officers waiting in a bus.

HEADLINE: The Changing Face Of Work in New York

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Fast Growth in Economy After 9/11'' (news article, July 13): 
New York City's economy has undergone a major transformation in recent years, as self-employment and small businesses have expanded. But that transformation is simply not reflected when looking at unemployment through the limited lens of the payroll data. 
 From 2000 to 2004, self-employment in New York City rose from 554,204 to 719,986, an increase of 30 percent. 
 Advances in technology have facilitated self-employment across all sectors of the economy: financial advisers, physical therapists, accountants, graphic designers, private car services, immigrant entrepreneurs.
 We would argue that New York is not in a jobless recovery, but that New Yorkers are increasingly deriving their income from a variety of sources. 
 If one simply considers the strength of the cash-based underground economy, which is evident on every street corner in our city, and the enormous growth of the self-employed, many of whom understand that long-term job security is no longer provided by large employers, then the city surely has more people working today than in 2001.

HEADLINE: How Far Would You Drive to Avoid a Rental-Car Tax?

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
People will stand in line for an expensive cup of coffee, but a study to be released today by the nation's largest car rental company shows that people will go miles out of their way to avoid a $4-a-day tax on rental cars. 
 The study, for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, also challenges the widely held perception that taxes on rental cars are imposed on visitors, rather than local residents, and are thus a free lunch for local governments. 
Enterprise Rent-A-Car, the privately held St. Louis company that is the nation's largest car rental agency with 667,000 vehicles, hired two tax economists, William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution and Kim Rueben of the Urban Institute. Mr. Gale and Mr. Rueben looked at every jurisdiction with local rental-car taxes, but focused on tax avoidance behavior in Kansas City, Mo., because there were many rental offices just outside the city.
 The study compared every Enterprise rental in and around Kansas City in 2002 though 2004 with rentals in the first half of 2005, when a $4-a-day tax to subsidize a local sports arena began.
 Among people who lived within five miles of an Enterprise location where the tax applied, large numbers rented from an office more than five miles away where the tax did not apply. The number of cars rented by such people in the taxed area fell 41 percent while the number of rental days fell even more, by 69 percent. On average these renters avoided almost $16 each in local car rental tax.
 Many renters crossed the Missouri River into Kansas, costing the state of Missouri more than $6,800 a month in sales taxes just among Enterprise customers. In effect, the effort to increase local revenue came at the expense of all Missouri taxpayers outside of Kansas City.
 Some people who lived within a mile of a rental office where the tax applied rented from an office more than five miles away to avoid the tax, the analysis found.
 The $18 billion car rental industry has been fighting local excise taxes on car rentals. At least 80 local governments in 38 states have car rental add-on levies, and at least 24 more levies are being debated.
 The most common use of these excises is to finance sports stadiums and convention centers. At least 35 sports stadiums are or are expected to be financed partly with subsidies from car-rental taxes. Other research has shown that in the 1990's, subsidies provided 94 percent of sports stadium financing
 The findings illustrate how the trend toward cutting federal and state income tax rates has not reduced the burden of government, but instead shifted it, with local governments imposing new levies and increasing existing ones, adding complexity and collection costs to the system.
 When such a levy is used to finance a sports arena, it taxes one group -- people who rent cars -- to subsidize another, the owners of commercial sports franchises and their players. The study showed that this burden was borne mostly by local residents renting cars, not visitors to Kansas City. 
 Nationwide, airport rentals account for 46 percent of the car rental market, according to Auto Rental News, a trade publication.
 Mr. Gale said he was surprised so many people would go out of their way to avoid paying the tax. Referring to principles of taxation, the authors said that ''taxes should be designed to promote equity, simplicity and economic prosperity'' while ''car rental excise taxes fail all of these tests.''

HEADLINE: From Group of 8, Energy Focus Is on Oil

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: STRELNA, Russia, July 16 

 BODY:
The world leaders at a Group of 8 summit meeting on Sunday issued a communique on energy policy that touched lightly on alternatives to fossil fuels, like biomass and wind power, but focused mostly on how to bring more oil to the market. 
 President Bush and the other leaders -- from Russia, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- produced statements on corruption, trade and protection for copyrights and patents at a meeting that was overshadowed by the violence this weekend in Lebanon, Israel and the Gaza Strip. 
On energy, the Group of 8 leaders said they were addressing ''high and volatile'' prices, with oil soaring above $75 a barrel last week, by endorsing policies to encourage oil field investment and raise production. They said that demand for oil, natural gas and coal would rise more than 50 percent above current levels by 2030, and that these fossil fuels would constitute 80 percent of the world's energy supply by then. 
 Still, few concrete measures to control prices emerged from Sunday's talks in this town near St. Petersburg, reflecting the divergent interests of the countries here.
 The final statement called for ''investment in all stages of energy supply'' and ''transparency and good governance in the energy sector,'' but suggested no requirements on countries to make that happen. 
 A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, conceded that the language seemed directed against Moscow's consolidation of its oil and natural gas industry under state control. Still, all countries, including Russia, agreed to the statement.
 To dampen world oil prices, the Group of 8 members agreed to push oil-producing countries to be more open with data on reserves, or how much oil remains in the ground, an initiative put on the agenda by Russia.
 The group endorsed efforts by the Paris-based International Energy Agency to prepare for a possible world oil shock with a plan to coordinate the release of the Group of 8 countries' emergency reserves, like the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the United States. 
 On the environment, the statement praised the Kyoto Protocol as a tool to discourage energy waste and greenhouse gas emissions -- but only for those who have ratified the document, an acknowledgment that the United States had rejected the treaty.
 ''It is important to engage the private sector and other stakeholders in achieving these ends,'' the statement said, reflecting the Bush administration's preferred approach to climate change.
 The Group of 8 leaders said countries producing oil and other fossil fuels should open their energy industries to outside investment, crack down on corruption and prevent waste such as burning natural gas at oil fields, a practice called flaring that is widespread in Siberia.
 The statement said the Group of 8 members ''support the principles'' of the Energy Charter, a treaty intended to integrate the energy industry in former Soviet countries with Europe. Russia has signed the document, but it has not been ratified by Parliament, and the wording of the statement left unanswered questions of access to Russia's natural gas export pipelines for independent companies or third countries.
 Russia, acting as host of the Group of 8 for the first time, chose energy security as a focus of the meeting, a nod to the oil-fueled economic comeback here eight years after a severe economic crisis.
 When Russia briefly placed an embargo on natural gas supplies to Ukraine in January, however, European leaders and the International Energy Agency questioned the security of Russia's own supplies.
 The leaders adopted separate statements condemning piracy of intellectual property and counterfeiting of brand-name products, suggesting that each member country set up a Web site with information for patent and trademark holders on legal methods to defend their rights. 
 They issued a statement supporting the Doha round of trade talks, a largely stalled effort by developing countries to level the playing field with rich nations on trade by opening markets in agricultural goods.
 The leaders also issued statements on education and infectious diseases, especially avian flu.
 On corruption, the Group of 8's statement was a follow-up to an initiative begun by the British prime minister, Tony Blair, to encourage oil and mining companies to disclose to the public their royalty payments to Third World governments -- to help ensure that the money shows up later in those countries' budgets.
 The program, called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, has produced mixed results.

Israel Bombards Lebanon After Hezbollah Hits Haifa
The Lebanese militia Hezbollah unleashed its deadliest missile yet on Israel, killing eight people in the city of Haifa. Israeli warplanes struck targets in southern Beirut and southern Lebanon, killing 45 people and wounding more than 100, according to local reports. The impact of the deaths on both sides and the missile strike marked a qualitative and psychological escalation of the conflict on its fifth day. A1

The Lebanese militia Hezbollah fired 10 powerful rockets -- a kind it has never unleashed before -- which traveled more than 20 miles over northern Israel before slamming down in Haifa. 
The attack confirmed what Israeli security chiefs have warned for years: that Hezbollah has large, powerful rockets able to reach major Israeli cities. A8

Arabs Publicly Blame Hezbollah
Arab governments are taking the rare step of publicly blaming Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia, supported by Jordan, Egypt, several Gulf states and the Palestinian Authority, chastised Hezbollah for ''unexpected, inappropriate and irresponsible acts'' at an emergency Arab League summit meeting in Cairo. A1

Tacit U.S. Approval for Israel
The Bush administration appeared to give Israel tacit approval to cripple Hezbollah, casting the conflict in the Middle East in terms of a wider war on terrorism. That was a central theme of both public and private statements from senior American officials, even as President Bush and his aides issued a statement including a request for restraint in Israel's attacks on Lebanon.

Sunnis Shift View of U.S. in Iraq
As sectarian violence soars, many Sunni Arab political and religious leaders once staunchly opposed to the American presence in Iraq are now saying they need American troops to protect them from the rampages of Shiite militias and Shiite-run government forces. A1

Iraqi Officials' Safety Shaken
Gunmen in vehicles resembling those used by Iraqi security forces kidnapped Adil Mohamed al-Qazaz, president of one of Iraq's state-owned oil companies in Baghdad, an Oil Ministry spokesman said. The abduction underscored the danger that high-level Iraqi officials face and the power of criminal groups who strike at them seemingly at will. A12

Hospitals and Vendors Are Under Scrutiny
While the financial relationship between doctors and drug companies has come under intense scrutiny, much less is known about how hospital executives interact with companies that sell them drugs, medical equipment and financial services. A1

Aid Arrives for Gulf Coast
Nearly $10 billion in federal aid is starting to flow into the hands of people in Mississippi and Louisiana who lost their houses in last year's hurricanes, the culmination of a year of political battling and bargaining between the states and Washington. A1

A Reward for Arizona Voters
A proposal to award $1 million in every general election to one lucky Arizona resident simply for voting -- no matter for whom -- has qualified for the November ballot. Mark Osterloh, left, a political gadfly who is behind the initiative, is promoting it with the slogan ''Who wants to be a Millionaire? Vote!'' A1

Plan Cuts Medicare Payments
The Bush administration says it plans sweeping changes in Medicare payments to hospitals that could cut payments by 20 percent to 30 percent for many complex treatments and new technologies. The changes, the biggest since the current payment system was adopted in 1983, are meant to improve the accuracy of payment rates. A13

Bloomberg Commission Addresses Poverty in City
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's Commission on Economic Opportunity has been focused on how to solve the problem of rising poverty in a city as wealthy as New York. They found that the solution is employment, and rather than pumping benefits into households, they want the government to use more of its resources to allow people to enter the work force -- and stay in it.

Church Divided Over Gays
Though All Angels Church in New York City is a theologically conservative branch of the Episcopal Church, it serves a liberal diocese.

HEADLINE: BBC Presses for Financing, And Its Detractors Cry Foul 

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: LONDON, July 16 

 BODY:
Jonathan Ross, a BBC talk show host with a vocabulary as colorful as his wardrobe, recently pushed things a shade further than usual. In language that would make an American television regulator blush, he asked David Cameron, leader of the Conservative Party, whether, as a teenager, he had fantasized sexually about Margaret Thatcher.
 For critics of the BBC, the moment, which Mr. Cameron laughed off, provided a glorious opportunity to accuse the public broadcaster of losing its moorings. Mr. Ross, who is paid about $11 million, a year, became an example for claims that the BBC is arrogant, spendthrift and out of control, straying into areas of questionable taste as it tries to keep abreast of commercial broadcasters in a competitive media marketplace. 
 ''Such puerile vulgarity is what passes for satire these days on the channel that once brought us 'That Was the Week That Was' on a shoestring budget,'' The Scotsman, a newspaper, fumed in an editorial, referring to a 1960's BBC show that poked fun at politicians of that era.
 The BBC is under more than the usual degree of scrutiny because the license fee of $242 a year that every British television owner must pay to finance its operations is under review by the government. While the broadcaster's royal charter has been renewed for another decade, the level of financing must still be determined. 
 A majority of Britons, in a recent survey commissioned by the BBC, said they supported the license fee. But the review process and the corporation's plans for spending the money have opened the door to all sorts of critics from outside the BBC and some from within. 
 The BBC has asked the government to increase the license fee, which raises nearly $5.5 billion a year, by 2.3 percentage points more than the annual inflation rate over the next seven years. The BBC says the money is needed to pay for digital television and Internet services as it prepares for an uncertain future in which consumers will be able to choose from a proliferating array of media options.
 Mark Thompson, director general of the BBC, is expected to announce on Wednesday a reorganization aimed at meeting this challenge.
 ''The BBC is going through huge change, moving from traditional linear broadcasting to the challenging and exciting world of interactive on-demand digital media,'' Mr. Thompson said this month as the corporation published its annual report. ''It means the BBC's relationship with audiences is also constantly changing.''
 Signs of change include declining audiences for the BBC's flagship conventional television channels as viewers turn to digital alternatives or log on to the Internet.
 Meanwhile, some of the BBC's plans to move into new areas, particularly in its small but growing commercial activities, have upset some competitors in the private sector.
 Some publishers, for instance, have complained about the BBC's plans to start a weekly newsmagazine as part of its advertiser-supported print operations. And, while the BBC is prohibited from selling advertising on its television, radio and Internet services in Britain, overseas TV channels like BBC World have been raising money from commercials. 
 Now the BBC wants to add advertising to a new Web site for users outside Britain, who represent about a third of the traffic to the existing global Web site.
 Although British Web users would continue to be routed to an ad-free site, some rivals say the proposal to sell online advertising would give the BBC an unfair advantage in the race to stake out new-media ground, given that the BBC's online operations are, in effect, subsidized by license fees.
 Some commercial broadcast rivals are already experiencing tough times as the BBC broadens its presence, a situation that might seem hard to imagine in markets like the United States, where public broadcasters have little hope of competing with the private sector.
 Advertising revenue at the main television channel at ITV, the biggest British commercial broadcaster, has fallen sharply because of declining ratings and a shift to the Internet by many advertisers.
 Charles Allen, the chief executive of ITV, recently told The Sunday Times of London that if the BBC received the full increase in the license fee, it ''would distort the market to such an extent that it will be impossible for commercial broadcasters to compete on a level playing field.''
 With the government set to determine the level of financing by the end of the year, a report that it commissioned from an outside auditor concluded that the BBC ought to impose some efficiencies. The BBC's own cost-cutting plans have already created some internal tensions, however.
 Several labor organizations representing BBC employees, including the National Union of Journalists, last week called on members to vote for a series of strikes next month to protest further job cuts.
 More than 1,000 jobs have already been eliminated under a reorganization plan begun last year, and another 2,000 positions are scheduled to end.
 The unions also object to proposed changes in the pension plan, as well as what they call meager raises while some executives are receiving big pay increases.
 Although Mr. Thompson waived his bonus, and his paycheck last year of $1.12 million was about a third of Mr. Allen's at ITV, the unions say the 11 percent raise he received was one more example of how the BBC is increasingly acting like a commercial bully, rather than the genteel public broadcaster it once was.

HEADLINE: Couric Listens, But Who Will Watch?

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS is just the kind of place that Katie Couric had in mind when she decided to go on a six-city ''listening tour'' to build anticipation for her fall debut on the ''CBS Evening News.'' 
 A well-read place with a virulent streak of civic-mindedness, Minneapolis is one of those middle places where news is discussed, consumed and analyzed. And, although Ms. Couric had never previously found a reason to visit, Minneapolis is a splendid place to live if you disregard that six months a year you need to wear a spacesuit against the cold. She even made a pilgrimage to the statue of Mary Richards, the hat-throwing newswoman played by Mary Tyler Moore -- the implication being that Ms. Couric is ''going to make it after all.''
So what did she hear? We don't know for sure, because reporters were not among those handpicked -- including many local notables and functionaries -- to listen to all the listening in a private room of the new Minneapolis public library. 
 In spite of the lack of access, or perhaps precisely because of it, there were a few bumps in the seance of Minnesota Nice. Matt Bartel, a blogger for the local MNspeak.com, who had been invited, posted from his BlackBerry that he was in the audience. Press agents for WCCO television, the local CBS affiliate, came up and asked for his reporter's notebook. After some negotiations, according to The Star Tribune and Mr. Bartel, they settled on confiscating his pen, for what that was worth when you realize that they left him still in possession of his BlackBerry. Regardless of what she learns on her listening tour, Ms. Couric's engagement with new media could use a little work. (To everyone's relief, the pen was returned after the event.)
 FORTUNATELY Ms. Couric, I was in Minneapolis for the week, so I was able to help CBS out with a listening tour of my own in the local self-serve laundries, restaurants and bars. Give or take the dozens of people who declined to talk to me -- Minnesotans are famously proud of their humility -- I found some very encouraging news for Ms. Couric. 
 It turns out that people here, all kinds -- black, white, young, old, liberal and, well, liberal -- adore her. And why not? She is, by all accounts and evidence, funny, smart, nice and pretty. 
 But there was also some discouraging feedback: many of the younger people I asked about Ms. Couric or the evening news responded as if I were an archaeologist inquiring about a quaint custom dating back centuries. Unless Ms. Couric was planning on setting herself on fire every night, few people thought they could find a way to be home at 5:30 in the evening (Central Standard Time) to gather around the television set. 
 Chris Campanella, who works at a nightclub in downtown Minneapolis, had stopped by Eli's Bar and Grill on Hennepin Avenue to work his way through a plate of chicken wings. He dropped the kind of quote that should warm the cockles of every corner office at CBS headquarters.
 ''I have no problem with her doing the news,'' he said, ''She is smart and informed, with a well-known history of being a quality reporter. There is a world of reasons to try it. Network news has been too masculine for too long. You know, Rather, Jennings and Brokaw.''
 Still, Mr. Campanella, who seemed pretty smart and well informed himself, had no idea that Dan Rather had been nudged out, that Tom Brokaw had retired or that Peter Jennings had died. 
 But then, that may be part of what is driving Ms. Couric's ascension and her listening tour. Millions of people who have not watched the evening news in years will tune in come September, and even those who are there to check hair and make-up may find something relevant enough to stick around on the following nights.
 Tom Madryga, a local trucker who was doing his laundry in southwest Minneapolis, will stop by for a look, even though he has already made up his mind on Ms. Couric.
 ''I don't care for her. She's too liberal for me,'' he said. ''But I will be watching in the beginning, because I'm curious just like anybody else. It seems like a big jump to me.''
 A few machines away, Liz Post, who runs a personal shopping business, was hustling to get through a few more loads. She lives in a news-interested household and is looking forward to a new reason to watch a form that has changed little in decades.
 ''Maybe they will stop repeating the same story over and over,'' she said. ''Maybe they have to do that, but it is pretty dumbed-down to begin with. It's like, 'I get it, let's move on.' ''
 At the Dunn Brothers coffee shop a few doors away, Bill McGill -- he's more an Economist magazine man than a TV watcher -- displayed a shocking level of cynicism about the shocking level of cynicism that he says he thinks is driving the listening tour.
 ''It's clear she came for show,'' said Mr. McGill, who owns an executive search firm. ''She isn't going to use what she has learned, it's just soft promotion. It seems very much like what a politician would do.''
 There may be a reason for that. Ms. Couric's personal publicist, Matthew Hiltzik, organized Hillary Rodham Clinton's listening tour when she was considering running for the Senate in New York. But it is worth recalling that Ms. Clinton, who seemed to start from a very deep hole, got off to a remarkably productive, popular start once she was elected. 
 Ms. Couric's tour -- which also had stops in San Diego, San Francisco, Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver and Tampa, Fla. -- left some wondering who was listening to whom.
 ''How can regular people participate in something they only read about the day after?'' said Patrick Lopez de Victoria at the coffee shop, giving the item about the visit in the daily paper a loud flick with his finger. ''If they wanted regular people, they should have held a public event on the Nicollet Mall or the Mall of America.''
 Leon Trawick, a lawyer from Minneapolis who stopped in for a drink at J. D. Hoyt's, a steakhouse in downtown Minneapolis, said the opinions he was interested in seeing expressed should be on the newscast itself.
 ''Africa is a mess, the Middle East is blowing up, but I don't see any teeth in any of these stories,'' he said. ''People are already informed. You have to give me something more -- tell me what you think the truth is -- to expect me to take the time to tune in network news.''
 It is clear that the battle that Ms. Couric will be confronting this fall is less uphill than up against a wall -- one composed of real-time data that leaves very few stones unturned by the end of the day.
 ''I like her. I watched her this morning,'' said Stephen Paul, an investment banker who was at the bar at J. D. Hoyt's, warming up for dinner. ''I have Bloomberg, CNN and all of the information coming at me over the Internet every day. By the time I get home, I pretty much know what I need to know and could use a little peace and quiet.''

HEADLINE: The Mayor Focuses on Poverty, and a Panel Is Ready to Help 

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
It is a group drawn from the upper echelons of New York City's business, nonprofit, academic and social services sectors, with Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Time Warner, and Geoffrey Canada, who runs one of the most acclaimed antipoverty programs in the country, at its helm.
 For the last four months, the group has been focused on solving a perplexing riddle: the problem of rising poverty in a city as wealthy as New York. They have analyzed data about who is poor in the city and why. They have sought the advice of business and labor leaders. They have made field trips to places like Rikers Island and job and social service centers in the Bronx and Brooklyn to talk to people about their economic challenges. Some members have even traveled to England for a firsthand look at that country's efforts to reduce poverty.
Their conclusions are expected to form the basis of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plans to attack chronic poverty in New York during his second term, much as he sought to overhaul the school system during his first. To that end, the mayor has put nearly all of his agencies on notice that they must be part of the effort as the group, the Commission on Economic Opportunity, is completing its work to present to him. 
 Although the specific recommendations will not be complete for several weeks, the thinking behind them has narrowed to a central notion: the solution to poverty is employment. But in a twist on the welfare-to-work policies of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the group has agreed that the government must use more of its resources to foster conditions that allow people to enter the work force and stay in it.
 To achieve that goal, the commission has been looking at ways to increase access to child care so parents can hold on to their jobs. It has also been devising ways to use city resources to tailor training programs to an ever-changing job market, and to focus public schools on preparing students not only for college, but also for the workplace. The approach departs from the welfare-based strategies of previous generations, but emphasizes government's role in making employment worthwhile for the poor. 
 ''It's not about pumping public benefits into households in order that they can have disposable income,'' said Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, who is overseeing the commission. Rather, she said, the focus is ''what can we do to direct investments in poor households in a way that improves their earning capacity.''
 The administration hopes the panel's findings will help shift the focus and function of the city government and realize the mayor's vision of attacking poverty as a central element of his legacy.
 ''I really believe that getting a good education is at the heart of any solution to poverty,'' Mr. Bloomberg said last month at a conference organized by the commission. ''If you fix the school system, that may not solve all the problems of fixing poverty,'' he continued, ''but it is one of those necessary if not sufficient conditions to really make progress.''
 The effort is not without minefields. Mr. Bloomberg has charged the commission with finding ways to diminish or eradicate poverty without significantly increasing the size or cost of government. At the same time, there is a strong sense in the administration and on the commission that government must play a far more aggressive role in giving people the tools and support they need to work, much of which has a cost.
 ''There is a recognition that not everyone can go out there and compete equally, and that we have to use our resources and agencies and policies and programs in a way that gives people the best shot at gaining employment,'' Ms. Gibbs said. One way to do that, she said, is to make sure that agencies work together as much as possible, strengthening their individual programs by bringing them together and sharing money.
 But another is finding ways to ensure that no one is penalized for taking a job.
 Mr. Canada said that under the current system, employment does not necessarily make people better off economically. ''You might start working, lose a subsidy and end up with less cash than when you weren't working,'' he said. ''It's got to be better for folks to have jobs.''
 Since many of those subsidies come from the federal government, commission members are weighing how the city could step in and make up the difference, and how to present an argument that would gain the mayor's approval.
 ''The city is going to have to invest some money in an area that's going to make a difference,'' Mr. Canada said, adding that he was speaking for himself and not the commission. ''When it comes to the kinds of investments that you need to make, if in the end we can't show poor people that working pays, it's going to be hard to lift folks out of poverty.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's critics have said that his approach to poverty during the first term was at best indirect, as officials pursued economic development, housing and education as priorities. But soon after winning re-election, Mr. Bloomberg challenged his commissioners to think boldly about setting new goals. 
 Ms. Gibbs, who was then the commissioner of homeless services, took up the charge and began talking with other city commissioners, including those at the Departments of Health, Housing Preservation and Development, Probation, and Correction, about how all of their agencies could work together to better help poor families. Out of that process, which included her discussions with Mr. Bloomberg about creating the new deputy mayor slot that eventually became hers, came the commission.
 The commission members see their mission as far-reaching.
 ''There's genuine involvement across a lot of agency boundaries, and people are energized in a way I've certainly never seen before,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, the director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University Graduate Center and an adviser to the commission. He added that even the attempt to attack poverty in such a comprehensive fashion felt fresh.
 ''Just the idea that we should face poverty and inequality as a municipal challenge hasn't been said since the War on Poverty,'' Mr. Mollenkopf said. ''There's a realization that most social services are not designed to cure poverty but to help people cope with its consequences.''
 In trying to find that cure, Ms. Gibbs has pulled together a high-profile panel. There are wealthy civic leaders like William C. Rudin, a real estate executive who is chairman of the Association for a Better New York, and Merryl H. Tisch, co-chairwoman of a State Board of Regents committee and an officer of the Metropolitan Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty and the UJA Federation of New York.
 There are former City Hall officials, like Stanley Brezenoff, who served in the Koch administration and is now president and chief executive of Continuum Health Partners, a group of hospitals, and Ester R. Fuchs, a professor of public affairs and political science at Columbia University who was a special adviser to Mr. Bloomberg in his first term.
 And then there are community advocates and service providers, like Mr. Canada, who created the Harlem Children's Zone, a widely emulated nonprofit organization that provides a network of educational, employment, housing and counseling services to families living within a 60-block area of Upper Manhattan.
 Over the next few weeks, commission officials said, Ms. Gibbs's staff plans to analyze the costs and likely outcomes of an enormous list of recommendations with an eye toward picking a first round to pursue.
 ''No one is taking the summer off,'' Mr. Canada said.

HEADLINE: Crowds Rally Again to Demand Recount in Mexican Vote

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON; Antonio Betancourt and James C. McKinley Jr. contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 16 

 BODY:
For the second time in eight days, thousands of supporters of the leftist presidential candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, filled this city's historic central plaza to demonstrate their support for his demand for a vote-by-vote recount of Mexico's disputed July 2 election. 
 The crowds at this rally -- several hundred thousand -- were considerably larger than the last and seemed to indicate that the movement started by the embattled former mayor of Mexico City remained strong. 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador told the throngs of people roaring his name that a recount was not too much to ask to resolve the political crisis that has gripped the nation since election officials declared his conservative opponent, Felipe Calderon, who appeared to be the winner by less than 1 percent of 41 million ballots cast. 
 That victory has yet to be certified by the Federal Electoral Tribunal as it weighs a legal challenge from Mr. Lopez Obrador. In the meantime, he seems determined to keep up pressure on the tribunal to grant his demand for a recount.
 Mr. Lopez Obrador and supporters who helped organize the rally urged his followers to conduct nonviolent acts of civil disobedience, including boycotts of products made by Mexican companies that opposed his candidacy as well as those of some American companies, without explaining why. 
 He also asked them to stage sit-ins starting Sunday at the 300 district election offices across the country. The purpose, he said, was to prevent any tampering with ballot boxes. 
 At one point during his speech, Mr. Lopez Obrador smiled as the crowd chanted, ''You are not alone.'' He told them that the movement he was leading was about more than one man or one political party. He said it was about the future of this country's fragile democracy.
 ''I have the deep conviction that despite all the machinery of the state, and all the money of a privileged group, they will not be able to stop the free will of millions of Mexicans,'' he said. ''That is the greatest force of a democracy.''
 Mr. Calderon and his supporters say that their victory is legitimate and that a recount will do more harm than good to an electoral system that was meticulously engineered to move Mexico toward democracy after decades of autocratic, one-party rule.
 They have described Mr. Lopez Obrador as so obsessed with power that he will stop at nothing to win, even using mass marches to try to bully his way to power over the decisions of the democratic institutions it has taken Mexico more than a decade to build.
 Arturo Sarukhan, a leading adviser to Mr. Calderon, said his candidate would accept a recount if one was ordered by the electoral tribunal. But he said his candidate did not believe a recount was legally necessary, since the votes were counted on election night by citizens recruited at random to be poll workers.
 ''They are seeking to pressure the tribunal to say this is too complicated, let's annul the whole thing,'' Mr. Sarukhan said. ''We are convinced this is not about a recount. This is about annulment.''
 In a voluminous complaint before the electoral tribunal, Mr. Lopez Obrador charged that the voting was riddled with mistakes and rigged against him by President Vicente Fox, who openly supported Mr. Calderon, who is from the same party.
 He also accused business leaders of meddling in the election by conducting a campaign that depicted Mr. Lopez Obrador as a danger to the political and economic stability Mexico has enjoyed over the last six years. 
 At 1:30 p.m. Sunday, Mr. Lopez Obrador led about 200,000 supporters down one of the city's main thoroughfares and into the Zocalo, as the city's main plaza is known. About 200,000 more were already waiting there.
 Rossana Fuentes Berain, a political analyst at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, looked out on the crowd from the terrace of a hotel adjacent to the plaza and wondered whether Mr. Lopez Obrador could keep a rein on the outrage he had unleashed.
 ''I am very worried,'' she said. ''If he can convince so many people that the democratic system isn't working, then we are going to throw away 20 years of building trust and confidence.''
 People interviewed at the rally said their distrust of the system had compelled them to come from as far north as Mexico's border with the United States and as far south as the state of Chiapas. 
 Like the crowd of people who came out last week to support Mr. Lopez Obrador, this gathering also seemed to be a broad cross section of people with different levels of education and incomes. 
 Many of those interviewed brought up the 1988 election, considered a pivotal moment in this country's long history of electoral fraud. Some said that although there had been progress since then, it had not been enough to stop the entrenched oligarchies from using their powers to stand in the way of the will of the people. 
 Others said that although they supported Mr. Lopez Obrador, they worried that his language had become increasingly volatile and could push the country into violence.
 ''People are tired of so much injustice,'' said Pablo Huitron Neguis, 44, an elementary school teacher. ''We have fought years to have our votes respected, and now they are using the same old strategies to rob us again. Lopez Obrador knows that if the people unite, there is no one who can stop us.''
 There were lots of angry expressions from unlikely places.
 ''If blood must be spilled, then so be it,'' said a housewife, Graciela Saavedra, 44. ''We don't want it, but we are tired of accepting fraud with our arms crossed.''
 There seemed to be just as many calls for calm. ''We know there was fraud,'' said Pablo Serna, 27, a dentist from the north central state of Zacatecas. ''But there is no reason to generate so much resentment. There is also no reason to discredit everything because the movement could turn against us.''
 Although it was clear Mr. Lopez Obrador would not back down from his fight, his appeals Sunday seemed toned down from earlier this week, when election officials challenged the credibility of several videos he presented as proof of fraud. 
 ''He who owes nothing, fears nothing,'' Mr. Lopez Obrador said, explaining why in his view Mr. Calderon should not object to a recount. Later, he added, ''The stain of an illegitimate election cannot be cleaned with all the water in all the oceans.''

HEADLINE: Despite Joint Statement on Mideast, Strains Emerge as U.S. Supports Israel's Campaign

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington for this article, C.J. Chivers from Strelna, Russia, and David E. Sanger from Vermont.

DATELINE: STRELNA, Russia, July 16 

 BODY:
The Bush administration on Sunday appeared to give Israel tacit approval to cripple Hezbollah, casting the widening conflict in the Middle East in terms of a wider war on terrorism. 
 That was a central theme of both public and private statements from senior United States officials, even as President Bush and his aides issued a statement that included a call for restraint in Israel's attacks on Lebanon. They were trying their best to minimize differences with European nations and their Russian hosts at the opening of the annual summit meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations here.
But the strains were clear as different leaders offered their interpretations of the statement drafted at the summit meeting that said, in an apparent allusion to Hezbollah and its Iranian and Syrian supporters, ''These extremist elements and those that support them cannot be allowed to plunge the Middle East into chaos.''
 President Jacques Chirac of France characterized the statement issued here as a call for a cease-fire -- a word the Bush administration has sidestepped at every turn over the last few days. The host of the summit meeting, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, told reporters that ''we do get the impression that the aims of Israel go beyond just recovering their kidnapped soldiers.'' 
 Talking to reporters here on Sunday evening, R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, acknowledged that the statement does not present any specific order for steps to solve the crisis; rather, he said, it presumes that Israel will stand down only after Hezbollah and Hamas stop shelling Israeli towns and release captured soldiers.
 In an interview on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said: ''Israel has the right to defend itself. We would expect nothing less.'' She quickly added that the administration had been ''in constant contact with the Israelis to urge restraint, to urge them to think about the consequences of what they're doing.''
 Under renewed criticism by Democrats for engaging in the Middle East only episodically, Ms. Rice said she had made no decision about whether to go to the region. When pressed on a cease-fire, she said on ''Fox News Sunday'' that ''a cessation of violence is crucial, but if that cessation of violence is hostage to Hezbollah's next decision to launch missiles into Israel or Hamas's next decision to abduct an Israeli citizen, then we will have gotten nowhere.'' 
 Getting somewhere is clearly the American aim, said a senior official, who noted that administration officials also ''want to come up with a solution where you don't end up in the same place four weeks from now.''
 The official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used because he is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, also said that Ms. Rice would travel to the region only if she thought she could influence matters. For now, the official said, the United States is relying on the Egyptians, Saudis and Jordanians to pressure Iran and Syria to pressure Hezbollah. 
 Ms. Rice and other officials repeatedly noted Iran's support of Hezbollah -- the Iranians appear to have supplied many of the rockets that have hit Haifa, other areas of Israel and perhaps an Israeli ship -- and some administration officials said they saw this as the moment to damage the link between Iran and Syria and the Hezbollah fighters who appear to operate with impunity in southern Lebanon. 
 At the same time, American officials were careful in their accusations against Iran, stopping short of saying that nation inspired the current outbreak of violence. But several officials noted that the crisis had distracted the leaders from what, just days ago, appeared to be one of their main agenda items -- pressing Iran to suspend its production of nuclear material in exchange for a broad economic incentives deal offered by Europe and the United States. Several officials suggested that the Iranian leadership might see the renewal of fighting as a chance to demonstrate how it could strike back at American interests in the region, both in Israel and in Iraq. 
 Yet Mr. Bush won a victory here on Sunday, when a statement issued by the leaders urged Israel to show the ''utmost restraint'' but also cast the new conflict in terms of a wider war on terrorism. The statement blamed militants for the start of the five-day conflict, saying they were intent on destabilizing the entire region, and more specifically were setting back progress toward democracy in Lebanon.
 American officials pointed to the statement issued by the leaders of the Group of 8, which also includes Britain, Italy, Germany, Canada and Japan, as evidence of some success in getting other nations to address the root causes of terrorism in the Middle East.
 While these summit meetings always have broad agendas -- from economic initiatives to programs to deal with poverty, AIDS and proliferation -- Mr. Bush has used every one since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to engage allies in what he has called a ''global war on terrorism,'' a phrase many European nations are hesitant to adopt. 
 But many European officials privately said that Mr. Bush was facing another of the unintended consequences of the war in Iraq. They cited the administration's claims, in 2003, that toppling Saddam Hussein would empower Middle East peace efforts; three years later, they noted, fighting has resumed and that effort is moribund. Iran, they contended, felt emboldened by the fact that the United States was distracted in Iraq.
 Mr. Bush, Ms. Rice and others countered that their critics had missed a remarkable turn in events, in which some Arab nations, including Jordan and Saudi Arabia, were joining in the criticism of the attacks committed by Hamas and Hezbollah. 
 In Mr. Bush's view, aides said, the attacks were driven by the reaction of terrorist groups to efforts to spread democracy in the region, including in Lebanon, where a weak but democratically elected government has been in place since Syria was forced to withdraw from the country. 
 ''We have a new day in the Middle East, and it is a day in which the people of the Middle East, the people of Lebanon without Syrian forces there, the people of the Palestinian territories with a democratic leader in Mahmoud Abbas, are seeking to find a democratic future,'' Ms. Rice said. ''We're standing with all responsible parties in the region and with moderate parties in the region who want a Middle East that is different than the 30-plus years of -- really, 60-plus years -- of Middle East history.''
 She did not dwell on the fact that elections also brought to power Hamas in the Palestinian territories and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. 
 Striking the same theme as Ms. Rice, Dan Bartlett, the White House counselor, said failures to address the deeper issues in the Middle East had ultimately led to the creation of Al Qaeda. Speaking of old policies credited with creating stability in the region, Mr. Bartlett said, ''All you had was resentment brewing underneath that, and that's why you have 3,000 Americans who died'' on Sept. 11.
 Mr. Bartlett's comments appeared to be part of a White House effort to link all Middle East militant groups together, and to suggest that strangling all of them -- from Hezbollah to Al Qaeda -- was critical to establishing a long-term peace.
 During the talks about drafting the statement here, the United States at times seemed isolated in its support for Israel, with other countries complaining that it was not doing enough to lay blame for the escalation of the crisis on Israel's reaction to the attacks and to the capture of Israeli soldiers -- a reaction that many leaders have described as excessive.
 Mr. Bush himself seemed to be struggling to calibrate his comments. He alternated between strongly worded statements supporting Israel's campaign and, apparently in response to concerns from allies that he was not urging enough restraint, telling Israel to avoid civilian casualties and the destruction of the Lebanese infrastructure.
 On Sunday Mr. Bush said of Israel: ''Our message to Israel is, look, defend yourself, but as you do so, be mindful of the consequences. And so we've urged restraint.''
 Mr. Putin, whose own relations with the United States are strained, contrasted Russia's approach of engaging all the parties with Washington's refusal to talk directly to Iran. ''We are using all channels,'' he said, later adding that those channels showed the value of having open relations with Iran and Hamas.
 The difference of approach became clear when the United States pressed to cite Iran and Syria in the joint statement with the other leaders, and suggested that both countries were involved, if indirectly, in the attacks on Israel. But Mr. Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said during a late-night briefing here that the effort had failed. ''Some governments felt comfortable doing that and some did not,'' he said, insisting that it was clear to which nations his statement referred.
 Mr. Putin said later that his was one of those countries.

HEADLINE: Issue of Mideast Violence Dominates G8 Summit Talks

BYLINE: COMPILED by JAMES K. PHILIPS and MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.
 TODAYS TOP STORIES
The march of world events has interrupted the carefully planned itinerary of the Group of Eight Summit, which was to wrap up today. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Russias WTO woes, Irans recalcitrance on nuclear power and the crisis in Lebanon have overshadowed the anticipated negotiations on energy security, infectious diseases and education. Leaders quickly reached agreements on the latter issues, Rossiiskaya Gazeta reports, signing all related documents by mid-day Sunday.
 The central issue of the summit, says Kommersant, has turned out to be the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Middle East. With Israel and Lebanon practically engaged in a full-scale war, the newspaper reports that the summit turned into a version of a United Nations Security Council. From the outset, it looked as if President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would adopt opposing responses to the crisis, says Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Mr. Bush immediately placed blame on the militant group Hezbollah, which is responsible for kidnapping two Israeli soldiers and firing rockets at Israeli cities. Mr. Putin on the other hand, accused Israel of having a wider agenda than just the recovery of its missing soldiers. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later said that there was no contradiction between the positions of the United States and Russia, the newspaper reports. 
 Nezavisimaya Gazeta also reports on the stalled negotiations over Russias entry into the World Trade Organization. According to German Greff, Minister of Economic Development and Trade, at the last moment the United States unexpectedly reneged on a deal to provide veterinary certificates for all American beef and pork imported to Russia. Mr. Bush, commenting on the situation, admitted that it can be difficult to conduct negotiations with the United States. But, he said, this shows that we want the agreement to be acceptable to Congress. Mr. Putin responded by saying that the good personal relationship with my friend [Bush] helps us to conduct negotiations, Rossiiskaya Gazeta reports. It does not, Mr. Putin continued, prevent us from maintaining our national interests.
 The two leaders did make some headway on a global initiative against nuclear terrorism. They were silent on the exact details, but said they agreed to work together to achieve mutual goals, says Nezavisimaya Gazeta. This success was marred somewhat by news of Tehrans refusal to halt its nuclear programs and respond to inquiries from the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
 Rossiiskaya Gazeta gives a rundown of the results from the scheduled negotiations. On energy security, G8 leaders signed an agreement preserving barriers to investment and trade in the energy sector. Participants recognized that Russia is not in a position to set up an energy export monopoly. According to the Russian Minister of Industry and Energy, Viktor Khristenko, Russia and Europe are again on the same page regarding energy. The goal is to openly present, discuss and coordinate substantial energy strategies, Mr. Khristenko said. 
 On infectious diseases, leaders committed to strengthening a global network for the surveillance and monitoring of avian flu, AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Countries also pledged funds for the fight against global epidemics. The United States, according to Rossiiskaya Gazeta, pledged $15 billion over five years to AIDS-related research. According to Russian Surgeon General Gennady Onishchenko, the document on infectious diseases recognizes Russian primacy on issues relating to avian flu. 
 The newspaper notes that the document on education does not establish a plan for developing unified education systems. It does call for finding a way to raise the quality of education, to expand educational opportunities, and to encourage politicians to invest in this sphere. 
 Rossiiskaya Gazeta also notes that leaders held discussions on all three topics with delegates from the youth Group of Eight. 
 Gazeta points out that the cost of this summit is set to break previous records. The $400 million already spent on the event is twice as much as was spent on last years summit in Gleneagles, Scotland. This does not include business losses and a halt to tourism due to the virtual lock-down of St. Petersburg during the summit. According to Vladimir Kozhin, head of financial affairs for the summit, the event will pay for itself. He notes that much of the money (90 percent of which came from the federal budget) has gone into renovation and restoration projects in St. Petersburg. In addition, Mr. Kozhin said that he plans to give 300 computers to local schools after the summit concludes. 
 Izvestia notes, that while St. Petersburg residents did not get to see the G8 presidents, they did witness another summit: the congregation of anti-globalists of the so-called Anti-summit. The newspaper reports that Russian law enforcement officials, in cooperation with colleagues from G8 countries, easily managed the situation. In comparison with other summits, Izvestia says, St. Petersburg was quiet. On Sunday the militia arrested 37 anti-globalists who had escaped from their holding pen in Kirov Stadium. 

IN OTHER NEWS

KOMMERSANT
BATTLE WITH EXTREMISM ACCEPTED CONDITIONALLY: Russias upper house, the Federation Council, accepted conditional changes to the law on extremism Friday. The bill broadens the definition of extremism to such an extent that committees within the council openly expressed their worries on its potential implementation. The commission on information policy approved the bill, noting that the interpretation of slander, threat of violence, or threats endangering government officials lives, in the context of extremism, could threaten the rights and freedoms of all citizens of Russia. The bill proposes changes that include these as well as equally flexible offenses like carrying out actions that violate human rights and freedoms. The bill will be sent to Russias lower house, the Duma, when it comes back for the fall session in September, at which point many politicians expect further clarification of the more vague points regarding extremist conduct.

VEDOMOSTI
NO END TO TAX BURDEN FOR BUSINESSES: Amendments to the tax code were accepted by the Russian Parliament just before they left for vacation last week. The changes failed to address major problems, the paper said, leaving many areas available for tax officials to abuse. Specifically, the changes failed to address the random nature of tax inspections, the main headache for Russian business. Tax officials remain unconstrained as to the type of documents they can use as foundation for a random inspection. There was also no tax burden relief for businesses whose taxes account for over 50 percent of state budget income. Vedomosti sees this as a sign of the governments continued path to an oligarchic corporatist state system. Businesss share of the tax burden entitles it to a degree of influence within the state, and random tax inspections continue as the states way of controlling business. The losers in this scenario, the paper suggests, are the people, whose tax payments account for a mere 9.3 percent of state budget income in 2005. The people cannot exert influence over their government because they are not its major sponsor. The tax terror therefore, continues.

NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA
HOW MUCH CAN A G8 LEADER EAT IN A DAY?: In what the article calls a thought on the Russian scope of things, it takes a look at the nearly one million dollars spent feeding the Group of 8 Summit leaders. According to the calculations, approximately $330,000 dollars a day was spent on food for the eight leaders and their spouses during the summit. That comes to $41,000 dollars a day per leader together with their spouse. The article likewise notes the fact that the leaders of Germany and Japan came alone. The leaders, even combined with their spouses, could not eat that much, and therefore much of the food must have gone to waste. Such is the scope of waste on a Russian scale, the article writes. Addressing the head of the organizational committee secretariat for the preparation for the summit, Sergei Y. Vyazalov, the article draws attention to worried citizens who think that perhaps maybe there was some sort of mistake in the official calculations. Somehow an extra zero of some sort attached itself they propose. The article insists they are simply worried there was some mistake, because after all, you would give your last for your motherlands image!

KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA
PUTIN SHOWS OFF HIS CAR: The G8 summit began on an upbeat note, with President Vladimir V. Putins first car, a Zaporozhits, in the background. The Zaparozhits is a small, Soviet economy car made, appropriately enough, in Zaparozhe, Ukraine. It seems that while riding around Mr. Bushs ranch in Texas, Mr. Putin promised to show the American president his first car. Mr. Bush looked into the window of the car and judging from the fear in his eyes, he expected to find a dinosaur skeleton inside. When Mr. Putin offered Mr. Bush a ride, the latter quickly disappeared into the house, according to the article. When asked about his first car, Mr. Bush answered that he had a Triumph bike, which this article took as a bicycle rather than a motorcycle.

HEADLINE: Avast, Me Critics! Ye Kill the Fun

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Let's start with a few numbers. At Rottentomatoes.com, a Web site that quantifies movie reviews on a 100-point scale, the aggregate score for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' stands at a sodden 54. Metacritic.com, a similar site, crunches the critical prose of the nation's reviewers and comes up with a numerical grade of 52 out of 100. Even in an era of rampant grade inflation, that's a solid F. 
 Meanwhile, over at boxofficemojo.com, where the daily grosses are tabulated, the second installment in the ''Pirates'' series, which opened on July 7, plunders onward, trailing broken records in its wake. Its $136 million first-weekend take was the highest three-day tally in history, building on a best-ever $55 million on that Friday, and it is cruising into blockbuster territory at a furious clip. As of this writing, a mere 10 days into its run, the movie has brought in $258.2 million, a hit by any measure. 
All of which makes ''Dead Man's Chest'' a fascinating sequel -- not to ''Curse of the Black Pearl,'' which inaugurated the franchise three years ago, but to ''The Da Vinci Code.'' Way back in the early days of the Hollywood summer -- the third week in May, to be precise -- America's finest critics trooped into screening rooms in Cannes, Los Angeles, New York and points between, saw Ron Howard's adaptation of Dan Brown's best seller, and emerged in a fit of collective grouchiness. The movie promptly pocketed some of the biggest opening-weekend grosses in the history of its studio, Sony. 
 For the second time this summer, then, my colleagues and I must face a frequently -- and not always politely -- asked question: What is wrong with you people? I will, for now, suppress the impulse to turn the question on the moviegoing public, which persists in paying good money to see bad movies that I see free. I don't for a minute believe that financial success contradicts negative critical judgment; $500 million from now, ''Dead Man's Chest'' will still be, in my estimation, occasionally amusing, frequently tedious and entirely too long. But the discrepancy between what critics think and how the public behaves is of perennial interest because it throws into relief some basic questions about taste, economics and the nature of popular entertainment, as well as the more vexing issue of what, exactly, critics are for.
 Are we out of touch with the audience? Why do we go sniffing after art where everyone else is looking for fun, and spoiling everybody's fun when it doesn't live up to our notion or art? What gives us the right to yell ''bomb'' outside a crowded theater? Variations on these questions arrive regularly in our e-mail in-boxes, and also constitute a major theme in the comments sections of film blogs and Web sites. Online, everyone is a critic, which is as it should be: professional prerogatives aside, a critic is really just anyone who thinks out loud about something he or she cares about, and gets into arguments with fellow enthusiasts. But it would be silly to pretend that those professional prerogatives don't exist, and that they don't foster a degree of resentment. Entitled elites, self-regarding experts, bearers of intellectual or institutional authority, misfits who get to see a movie before anybody else and then take it upon themselves to give away the ending: such people are easy targets of populist anger. Just who do we think we are?
 There is no easy answer to this question. Film criticism -- at least as practiced in the general-interest daily and weekly press -- has never been a specialist pursuit. Movies, more than any other art form, are understood to be common cultural property, something everyone can enjoy, which makes any claim of expertise suspect. Therefore, a certain estrangement between us and them -- or me and you, to put it plainly -- has been built into the enterprise from the start.
 The current schism is in some ways nothing new: go back and read reviews in The New York Times of ''Top Gun,'' ''Crocodile Dundee'' and ''The Karate Kid Part II'' to see how some of my predecessors dealt with three of the top-earning movies 20 years ago. (The Australian with the big knife was treated more kindly than the flyboy or the high-kicker, by the way.) And the divide between critic and public may also be temporary. Last year, during the Great Box-Office Slump of 2005, we all seemed happy to shrug together at the mediocrity of the big studio offerings.
 No more. Whatever the slump might have portended for the movie industry, it appears to be over for the moment, and the critics have resumed their customary role of scapegoat. The modern blockbuster -- the movie that millions of people line up to see more or less simultaneously, on the first convenient showing on the opening weekend -- can be seen as the fulfillment of the democratic ideal the movies were born to fulfill. To stand outside that happy communal experience and, worse, to regard it with skepticism or with scorn, is to be a crank, a malcontent, a snob. 
 So we're damned if we don't. And sometimes, also, if we do. When our breathless praise garlands advertisements for movies the public greets with a shrug, we look like suckers or shills. But these accusations would stick only if the job of the critic were to reflect, predict or influence the public taste. 
 That, however, is the job of the Hollywood studios, in particular of their marketing and publicity departments, and it is the professional duty of critics to be out of touch with -- to be independent of -- their concerns. These companies spend tens of millions of dollars to persuade you that the opening of a movie is a public event, a cultural experience you will want to be part of. The campaign of persuasion starts weeks or months -- or, in the case of multisequel cash cows, years -- before the tickets go on sale, with the goal of making their purchase a foregone conclusion by the time the first reviews appear. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but the judgment of critics almost never makes the difference between failure and success, at least for mass-release, big-budget movies like ''Dead Man's Chest'' or ''The Da Vinci Code.'' 
 So why review them? Why not let the market do its work, let the audience have its fun and occupy ourselves with the arcana -- the art -- we critics ostensibly prefer? The obvious answer is that art, or at least the kind of pleasure, wonder and surprise we associate with art, often pops out of commerce, and we want to be around to celebrate when it does and to complain when it doesn't. But the deeper answer is that our love of movies is sometimes expressed as a mistrust of the people who make and sell them, and even of the people who see them. We take entertainment very seriously, which is to say that we don't go to the movies for fun. Or for money. We do it for you.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Rises As Heat Spurs Electricity Use 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Industrial production rose at a higher-than-expected rate of 0.8 percent last month as hot weather increased the use of electricity, while factories turned out more communications equipment and semiconductors. 
 The increase followed a 0.1 percent rise in May that was previously reported as a decline, the Federal Reserve said in its monthly report on output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities.
The proportion of industrial capacity in use rose to 82.4 percent, the highest in six years.
 Production increased in the second quarter at an annual rate of 6.6 percent, the fastest since the final three months of 1999 and a sign that corporate investment is sustaining economic growth as consumer spending slows. Higher energy costs and factories approaching limits on their ability to produce are inflation threats that Fed policy makers are watching as they decide whether to raise interest rates next month.
 ''Anything related to capital spending is strong and expected to stay strong,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. The rise in capacity utilization ''is one more indication that the Fed can't take its eye off of inflation. The Fed probably isn't finished raising rates.''
 Economists expected a 0.5 percent increase in June production. Capacity utilization, which rose from 81.8 percent a month earlier, was forecast to rise to 81.9 percent after a previously reported 81.7 percent.
 Work at factories, which accounts for almost 90 percent of industrial production, increased 0.7 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in May. Production of consumer durable goods, which includes automobiles, furniture and electronics, rose 2.2 percent after falling 0.5 percent the previous month.
 Production of autos and parts rose 4.2 percent after falling 0.8 percent. Cars and light trucks sold at an annual rate of 16.3 million in June, up from a 16.1 million rate a month earlier, industry data show. Vehicle production increased at an annual rate of 11.61 million in June, after 11.33 million in May.
 Production of nondurable consumer goods, like food, clothing and paper products, rose 0.4 percent for a second month.
 Electric and gas utility output jumped 0.7 percent in June, the most in three months, after rising 0.2 percent in May as hot weather led to increased air-conditioner use. 
 Mine production, which includes oil and gas exploration, rose 1.2 percent in June after a 0.3 percent rise in May, the report showed.
 Business equipment production, which includes transportation and information-processing equipment, increased 0.7 percent in June after falling 0.2 percent the previous month.

HEADLINE: China Says Economy Grew 11.3% in Quarter

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Tuesday, July 18 

 BODY:
The Chinese government said on Tuesday that its economy grew at its fastest pace in a decade in the second quarter, despite government efforts to cool down a stunning year of growth. 
 The economy grew 11.3 percent in the period, the statistics bureau announced, after growing by 10.3 percent in the first quarter, fueled by investments, bank loans and infrastructure spending.
At a news conference, the government said that its forecasts of 10 percent for the second quarter were far off. The 11.3 percent gain was the fastest-growth since 1994, when China's economy was much smaller.
 The second-quarter growth comes on the heels of a record trade surplus of $14.5 billion in June and could strengthen the case for further tightening measures.
 Economists at home and abroad are warning that the government must do something to cool growth, which has surged sharply in the last six months. 
 But Reuters quoted Zheng Jingping, the statistics office's spokesman, as saying that the government's cooling efforts were taking hold.
 The government has already raised interest rates, tightened restrictions on loans in some sectors and announced measures to tame real estate speculation. Yet China's growth continues to outpace that of all other major economies. 
 ''There's a time lag for those measures to have an impact on economic performance,'' Reuters quoted Mr. Zheng as saying. ''So we need time to see their impact. But the figures for June show that the measures have already started to take effect.'' 
 The government in Beijing is now contending with a fast-running economy, a record trade surplus, rising energy and raw material costs, sporadic labor shortages and real estate speculation. 
 Nearly every economic and financial barometer has turned favorable, perhaps too much so, in recent months, as stock prices on the domestic stock markets (long depressed) have rallied and the nation's currency, the yuan, has inched up against the dollar after China revalued it last year and then allowed it to float modestly. 
 When President Hu Jintao traveled to the United States earlier this year, he warned that the economy may be growing too fast.

HEADLINE: Times to Reduce Page Size And Close a Plant in 2008

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The New York Times is planning to reduce the size of the newspaper, making it narrower by one and a half inches, and to close its printing operation in Edison, N.J., company officials said yesterday. 
 The changes, to go into effect in April 2008, will be accompanied by a phased-in redesign of the paper and will mean the loss of 250 production-related jobs.
 Several other American broadsheets reduced their size a few years ago, and many are planning further shrinkage to cut costs as the price of newsprint climbs and newspapers lose readers and advertisers to the Internet.
 The Times, which made the announcement last night on the eve of its quarterly earnings report, said it would sublet its plant in Edison and consolidate its regional printing facilities at its newer plant in College Point, in Queens.
 That consolidation will mean the loss of about a third of the total production work force of 800.
 The Edison plant, which opened in 1992, is to keep printing papers until the spring of 2008, by which time one new press will have been added at College Point. That plant opened in 1997.
 The company said the changes would save about $42 million a year -- $30 million by consolidating printing at College Point and $12 million by reducing the size of the paper. Leaving the Edison plant means the company can avoid about $50 million in capital improvements there, although it will spend about $150 million to combine the facilities in College Point and buy a new press.
 The reduction in the size of The Times will mean a loss of 5 percent of the space the paper devotes to news. If the paper only reduced the size of its pages, it would lose 11 percent of that space, but Bill Keller, the paper's executive editor, said such a loss would be too drastic, so the paper will add pages to make up for some of the loss.
 ''That's a number that I think we can live with quite comfortably,'' Mr. Keller said of the 5 percent reduction, adding that the smaller news space would require tighter editing and putting some news in digest form.
 Several broadsheets -- including USA Today, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post -- have already reduced their size and others, like The Wall Street Journal, are planning to.
 ''It's painful to watch an industry retrench,'' Mr. Keller said. ''But this is a much less painful way to go about assuring our economic survival than cutting staff or closing foreign bureaus or retrenching our investigative reporting or diluting the Washington bureau.''

HEADLINE: Some Phelps Dodge Investors Concerned Over Merger Bid 

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, July 17 

 BODY:
When Phelps Dodge increased its friendly offer for the Canadian mining companies Falconbridge and Inco on Sunday, it hoped the new bid would appeal to shareholders of the two companies.
 But if Phelps Dodge is to be successful with the merger, valued at more than 40 billion Canadian dollars ($35 billion), it must win over its own shareholders.
On Monday some investors reacted negatively to the news that Phelps Dodge, based in Phoenix, would increase the cash portion of its bid for Inco by 2.75 Canadian dollars, to 20.25 Canadian dollars. Shares of Phelps Dodge fell $2.84, to $76.95. Inco also increased its separate offer for Falconbridge. 
 The new Phelps Dodge offer is an effort to thwart a recently increased hostile bid for Falconbridge by the mining conglomerate Xstrata of Zug, Switzerland.
 Even before the revised offer, at least two major Phelps Dodge shareholders were publicly skeptical of the plan.
 ''The increased offer merely raises the debt level of the resultant company and doesn't change the deal's diminution of shareholder value,'' said Basu Mullick, portfolio manager at Lehman Brothers who holds about 2.4 million Phelps Dodge shares in the Neuberger Berman asset management funds. 
 ''We think this deal destroys shareholder value,'' he added. ''It diminishes earnings per share, it leverages up the company's balance sheet at the top of the cycle and the synergies are minuscule.''
 In a interview before the increased offer was made, Rob Coburn, a spokesman for Atticus Capital, a hedge fund that holds about 6 percent of Phelps Dodge stock, offered similar doubts.
 ''We said we were not convinced of the worth of the proposal and that a repurchase of shares or potential sale of the company might be preferable,'' said Mr. Coburn, whose company has sparred with Phelps Dodge in the past.
 Prices for minerals like copper, Phelps Dodge's main line of business, and the nickel that is the mainstay of Inco and Falconbridge, are at record levels, and that is driving acquisitions and bids like that from Phelps Dodge, though investors differ on this point. 
 Mining companies are logging record cash flows, record profits and, in many cases, growing shareholder pressure to do something productive with the resulting gains.
 J. Steven Whisler, the chairman of Phelps Dodge, says he believes the best use of his company's cash is expanding the company. In an interview Monday, he said that spending on the acquisition of Falconbridge and Inco would generate benefits both immediately and over time.
 ''The short-term economics of this combination are extremely profitable,'' Mr. Whisler said. ''The combined companies' ability to generate cash is very, very impressive.''
 But Mr. Whisler said that such vigor would continue over time and through downturns in metals prices.
 Some investors differ with that idea.
 If Phelps Dodge succeeds in acquiring the two Canadian miners, its debt will rise from essentially nothing to about $23 billion to $24 billion, according to Mr. Whisler.
 While Mr. Whisler acknowledged that the figure is ''certainly eye catching,'' he argued that the combined company would have the cash flow to rapidly reduce it even with a decline in metals prices.
 But metals markets are notoriously cyclical. Although current prices are well above the hedge prices some mining companies anticipated, their unusually high levels have led to fears that an unexpectedly steep drop may follow.
 Projecting future metals prices, which are driven by a variety of factors, is difficult. Complicating any merger assessment are the differing outlooks for nickel and copper.
 The growth of house construction in North America and China has contributed in large part to the current high copper prices by forcing up demand for plumbing and electrical wiring. But nickel's big driver is the Chinese steel industry, which uses it to make stainless steel, in many cases for export.
 At the same time, not many new copper mines are opening, although several new nickel projects, including some owned by Inco, are nearing completion.
 In pitching the deal to Phelps Dodge shareholders, it would be critical for Mr. Whistler that Inco succeed in its friendly pursuit of Falconbridge.
 The overwhelming majority of the production-cost savings forecast by Phelps Dodge, and a crucial factor in its sales pitch, come from putting Inco and Falconbridge together. The two Canadian companies are literally neighbors in the major nickel fields surrounding Sudbury, Ontario.

HEADLINE: Settlement Is Reached In Ferry Case

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
New York Waterway, once the largest and most politically powerful ferry operator on the Hudson River, agreed yesterday to pay $1.2 million to settle civil charges that it overbilled the government millions of dollars in providing commuter services after the Sept. 11 attack. 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey hired Waterway to expand its ferry service between New Jersey and Lower Manhattan and replace the PATH rail link that was destroyed by the attack. 
In its civil complaint, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan said that Waterway had overcharged the Port Authority for boats and crews, inflated its costs and submitted false bills. The ferry company admits no wrongdoing and refers to the matter as a billing dispute, although prosecutors continue to view it as profiteering.
 ''Federal 9/11 funds were allotted to help the city recover and build anew,'' Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney for the Southern District, said in a statement released yesterday. ''This office is committed to recouping those funds from any company that took more than its fair share of profit from business it did as a result of those tragic events.''
 The settlement came only four days after Congressional hearings into the management of federal dollars that poured into New York after the attack. 
 The United States attorney's office filed the civil complaint against Waterway yesterday in federal court, as well as the settlement order. But the settlement document hinted that Waterway still faced a possible criminal case, or administrative charges.
 Waterway, which operates ferry landings in Weehawken, Hoboken and Jersey City, has insisted on its innocence ever since word of a government investigation first surfaced around New York Harbor three years ago. Yesterday, Waterway, which has struggled financially in recent years, tried to put the matter to rest by agreeing to a hefty fine, even as it denied any wrongdoing or liability. 
 ''It is regrettable that this service resulted in a billing dispute with the government,'' Arthur E. Imperatore Sr., Waterway's president and founder, said in a statement. ''We strongly deny any and all allegations with respect to these billing issues.'' 
 He added, ''It is less expensive to settle this matter than to litigate it to a conclusion. We therefore believe it prudent to use our resources to improve service to our customers, not to pay legal bills.''
 Two years ago, Waterway agreed to pay the city $800,000 to settle a dispute over landing fees at Pier 11 in Lower Manhattan for the federally subsidized service.
 Mr. Imperatore led the resurgence of cross-Hudson ferry service in 1986 when he started operating a boat between Manhattan and Weehawken. His plan was to build a $5 billion complex modeled after the city of Venice. To make the project more attractive to potential residents, he also started a bus service that takes commuters across Manhattan from a West Side ferry landing. Mr. Imperatore's ferry company grew, although the residential development never materialized.
 But his son, Arthur E. Imperatore Jr., was running the company in 2003 when the Port Authority's inspector general and the United States attorney's office began their investigation of Waterway. Waterway got most of the ferry contracts after Sept. 11 without having to go through a bidding process. At the time, Waterway's boats were carrying about 62,000 passengers a day and receiving about $1.74 million a month in subsidies from the Port Authority and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 Aside from possible fraud, investigators had also been looking into claims by rival ferry companies that Waterway had improperly limited competition by hoarding boats and controlling access to ferry landings.
 According to the civil complaint filed yesterday, the government had agreed to reimburse Waterway for boats it had to charter for the ferry service. In one example cited in the complaint, Waterway leased a boat from the Bar Harbor Whale Watch Company for six months. Ultimately, Waterway paid Bar Harbor $90,000, but billed the Port Authority for $126,000 and got it.
 The Port Authority had also agreed to guarantee that Waterway would earn the same profit margin -- 20 percent -- that it said it had earned before Sept. 11. But the complaint contends that Waterway substantially inflated that number, too.
 In another instance, Waterway got a federal grant from the Empire State Development Corporation after claiming it suffered $8.4 million in economic losses from the terrorist attack. But according to company records, Waterway's profit soared more than $3 million to $5.6 million in 2001, on record revenues of $47 million, the complaint said. 
 Arthur Imperatore Sr. retook the reins of Waterway and late in 2004, after ridership fell to 38,000 passengers daily and federal subsidies expired, sold some of its routes to another company, BillyBey Ferry. Today, New York Water Taxi and Sea Streak also provide ferry services.

HEADLINE: Texas Hospitals' Separate Paths Reflect the Debate on Immigration

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
The doctors and nurses at Parkland Memorial Hospital knew a lot about Zahira Dominguez, a maternity patient who was beginning to feel the squeeze of her contractions. 
 They knew that she had been born in Mexico, was a 15-year-old student at a Dallas high school and had gone to her prenatal checkups. They knew she was scared about giving birth.
What the hospital staff did not know, because they did not ask, was whether Ms. Dominguez was an illegal immigrant.
 ''I don't want my doctors and nurses to be immigration agents,'' said Dr. Ron J. Anderson, the president of Parkland. 
 Patients like Ms. Dominguez -- uninsured Hispanic immigrants with uncertain immigration status -- have flocked in recent years to public hospital emergency rooms and maternity wards in Texas, California and other border states. Their care has swelled costs for struggling hospitals and increased the health care bills that fall to states and counties, giving ammunition to opponents of illegal immigration who complain of undue burdens on local taxpayers. 
 As a result, health care has become one of the sorest issues in the border states' debate over illegal immigration. Facing harsh criticism from residents, public hospitals are confronted with an uneasy decision: demand immigration documents from patients and deny subsidized care to those who lack them, or follow the public health principle of providing basic care to anyone who needs it. 
 In Texas, two of the biggest public hospitals chose differently. 
 The Parkland Health and Hospital System, which serves Dallas County, offers low-cost care to low-income residents with no questions asked about immigration status. 
 ''We decided that these are folks living in our community and we needed to render the care,'' Dr. Anderson said.
 In Fort Worth, in neighboring Tarrant County, JPS Health Network requires foreign-born patients to show legal immigration documents to receive financial assistance in nonemergencies, like elective surgery and the treatment of routine or chronic illnesses. Executives said that their first responsibility was to legal residents, but that they were uncomfortable about having to make such distinctions. 
 ''I don't think you should ask the hospital to make moral decisions for the State of Texas or, for that matter, for the United States,'' said Robert Earley, a senior vice president of JPS.
 To some Fort Worth residents, the hospital -- which does provide emergency and maternity care to illegal immigrants -- has nonetheless sent a message that illegal immigrants are not welcome. 
 ''Whenever immigrants go to the hospital, the first thing they are asked is, 'Who are you and where are your immigration papers?' '' said Jose Aguilar, a leader of Allied Communities of Tarrant, a coalition of church-based community groups that has pressured the JPS board to reverse its policy. ''They are being scared away.'' 
 Across Texas, the debate over illegal immigration has spilled into county commission hearings and hospital board meetings. A study ordered by commissioners in Harris County, which includes Houston, found that about one-fifth of the patients in its health system last year were immigrants without documents, most of them from Mexico. Their numbers had increased 44 percent in three years, the study found, and their care had cost the county $97.3 million, about 14 percent of the health system's total operating costs. 
 ''We have a lot of United States citizens that need our help in health, and we should pull them up before we pull up someone here illegally,'' said Tim Gallagher, 45, a software salesman from Plano, north of Dallas, who in an interview expressed views widely shared in the state. Mr. Gallagher said he favored deporting illegal immigrants who sought care from public facilities, even if the patient was a mother who gave birth to an American citizen. 
 ''If somebody here needs health care, they should get it, and then if they are illegal, they should go bye-bye,'' said Mr. Gallagher, who wrote a letter on the subject to The Dallas Morning News. 
 In California, hospitals spent at least $1.02 billion last year on health care for illegal immigrants that was not reimbursed by federal or state programs, according to federal government estimates. Hospital officials there said the ailing health care system was being pushed to its limit. 
 ''Emergency rooms and hospital doctors are forced to subsidize the lack of immigration enforcement by the federal government,'' said C. Duane Dauner, president of the California Hospital Association. ''It amounts to an unfunded mandate for us to treat everybody.''
 California received $66 million in federal money in 2005, the first year of a four-year national program to help pay for emergency care for illegal immigrants. But it was ''not even a down payment'' on the total cost, Mr. Dauner said. With more than 1.4 million of California's residents uninsured and more than half of California's hospitals operating in the red, Mr. Dauner warned that care for illegal immigrants could tip some hospitals into bankruptcy.
 Even so, the surging numbers of illegal immigrants in the health care system have fed some misconceptions, hospital administrators said.
 While Texas border hospitals often get ''anchor babies'' -- children of Mexican women who dart across the border to give birth to an American citizen -- most illegal immigrants who go to major hospitals in Texas can show that they have been living here for years, said Ernie Schmid, policy director at the Texas Hospital Association. Many immigrant families have mixed status; often a patient with no documents has a spouse or children who are legal. 
 Most immigrant patients have jobs and pay taxes, through paycheck deductions or property taxes included in their rent, administrators at the Dallas and Fort Worth hospitals said. At both institutions, they have a better record of paying their bills than low-income Americans do, the administrators said. 
 The largest group of illegal immigrant patients is pregnant women, hospital figures show. Contrary to popular belief here, their care is not paid for through local taxes. Under a 2002 amendment to federal regulations, the births are covered by federal taxes through Medicaid because their children automatically become American citizens. 
 These cases are not affected by new regulations that went into effect on July 1 requiring Medicaid patients to provide proof of citizenship, Texas health officials said. They said they believed that only small numbers of illegal immigrants had received other Medicaid benefits. 
 Administrators at Parkland said the hospital delivered 11,500 babies last year to mothers who were probably illegal immigrants, representing at least 56 percent of its maternity patients. 
 One was Ms. Dominguez, whose family brought her to Dallas from Mexico 11 years ago. Guided through Parkland's prenatal care, the frightened teenager had an unexceptional labor and a robust baby girl. 
 Many immigrants have sought low-cost care by going to Parkland's emergency room, where, by federal law, they must be examined and treated, as is the case in any emergency room. Leticia Martinez, 24, walked into the emergency room one morning weak with cramps, fearing a miscarriage in her two-month pregnancy. 
 Ms. Martinez said she had been sure she would get care at Parkland because her first baby had been born there. ''They help economically,'' she said. ''They don't ask the immigration question.''
 Dr. Anderson fiercely defends Parkland's open policy. ''It's much wiser to render care than towait until they are very sick,'' he said. 
 In Fort Worth, JPS Health Network also provides low-cost prenatal care and delivery for illegal immigrant mothers. It does not offer them help for other nonemergency care. 
 In January 2004, the JPS board of managers voted to offer its financial assistance program to all Tarrant County residents, legal or otherwise. But eight months later, with illegal immigrants starting to fill the hospital, the managers reversed course in a meeting where they agonized over their votes, the minutes show.
 The policy has given the hospital a mixed reputation among Hispanics in Fort Worth.
 Edy Patricia Rodriguez, 18, an illegal immigrant whose husband is an American citizen, cuddled her newborn recently in a private, state-of-the-art room at the JPS hospital. The child, Pablo F. Ibarra, born June 28, thrived in the network's care, and his mother was satisfied.
 But misunderstandings about immigration status clouded the case of Victoria Canales, a Mexican immigrant who had sought care for advanced liver disease, said her husband, Jesus Canales, 36.
 Mrs. Canales was a legal resident and a member of the JPS network's low-income program. But hospital staff members seemed confused about her case, Mr. Canales said, and twice sent her home when she had gone to seek relief from the liquid filling her body. 
 Humiliated, Mrs. Canales was reluctant to return to the hospital until she could no longer manage at home, Mr. Canales said. She died June 26. 
 JPS officials say they do not refuse care to people who need it, but are wrestling with the demands of county residents and changing state laws.
 Mr. Earley, the JPS vice president, said, ''We have been bounced around like a basketball on this issue.''

HEADLINE: South Brings Capitalism, Well Isolated, to North Korea 

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: KAESONG, North Korea 

 BODY:
Just north of the demilitarized zone dividing the Korean Peninsula, in possibly the world's most heavily guarded special economic enclave, 500 managers from the South and 7,000 workers from the North are engaged in a capitalist experiment that is anathema to the United States. 
 The South Koreans recently gave a tour of the enclave, the Kaesong Industrial Park, to 200 foreign business executives, diplomats and journalists. The hosts expressed optimism that it would bring peace to the peninsula, then they led the visitors through factories churning out goods for markets in the South and elsewhere.
In one of the 15 factories, Taesung Hata, a cosmetics company, about 500 workers wearing dark blue uniforms and white hats operated machines that produced plastic cosmetic containers. Next door, 1,500 workers sat in rows of desks with sewing machines, below ceiling fans and decorative red flowers, making orthopedic shoes called Stafild that were described as ''Shoes for Unification.'' 
 To hear the South Korean hosts tell it, when the special economic zone is completed in 2012, it will be bigger than Manhattan, house 2,000 companies and employ 700,000 North Koreans. Yet Kaesong's significance is larger still, they say, because it will nudge the North toward embracing economic reforms and opening up to the world, the way Shenzhen did in China two decades ago, and open the path, as the shoes suggest, toward reunification.
 [The hosts also said they had considered canceling the June 22 tour, which coincided with rising tensions over North Korean preparations for a missile test on July 5, but decided against it.]
 Kaesong is South Korea's biggest project in what some here call unification by ''small steps,'' or ''de facto'' unification. The South does not want formal unification for a few more decades, but its strategy is to narrow the yawning gap of half a century of division through various projects, from manufacturing here in Kaesong to uniting the two Koreas' different Braille characters for the blind and sign language for the deaf.
 ''It's de facto unification,'' said Ko Gyoung-bin, who oversees the 18-month-old Kaesong project at the Ministry of Unification in Seoul. ''It's already under way. Unlike the German model, it won't happen suddenly.''
 The two Koreas agreed on building Kaesong in June 2002 when the South Korean president at the time, Kim Dae-jung, and the North's leader, Kim Jong-il, met in Pyongyang. Since then, the exchanges have become so routine that sports authorities on both sides are moving toward fielding a unified team for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.
 With cultural, academic, business, political or military exchanges going on between the Koreas nearly every week, 80,000 South Koreans visited the North last year. That did not include South Korean visitors to Kumgang Mountain, a North Korean resort opened to foreigners eight years ago. Kumgang has been visited by 1.25 million South Koreans.
 South Korean regional and local governments, regardless of political leanings, have also undertaken projects with counterparts in the North. More than 60 private organizations now send South Koreans north to assist on agricultural, health and other projects.
 ''We go to North Korea, where we work with our counterparts to show them how to use certain agricultural machines or how to breed better cattle,'' said Kang Young-shik, director of the Korean Sharing Movement, a private group that has undertaken the Braille and sign-language projects. ''They need help from us, though they also feel the need to compete with us.''
 Cho Yong-nam, a director general in the Unification Ministry, said South Korea had projects in 27 of 206 cities and counties in the North. The common theme, he said, is to raise standards in the North so that, in a unified Korea, North Koreans would not constitute ''a displaced, misfortunate minority group.''
 Companies that have come to Kaesong, which is managed by Hyundai Asan, a private company, have received tax breaks and other support from the South Korean government.
 A new highway and railroad traverse the DMZ before reaching Kaesong, about 40 miles northwest of Seoul. Soldiers stand watch on either side of the demilitarized zone, with its barricades, barbed wire fences and land mines. 
 In working with North Koreans, South Koreans have said, they have encountered the sometimes unexpected effects of their division: North Korean construction workers, for example, were rated only one-third as efficient as their counterparts from the South; many North Koreans, with little experience handling machines, have required extensive training.
 Sometimes, South and North Koreans had trouble communicating because the language spoken on either side of the DMZ has changed significantly. (One project supported by the South is a unified dictionary with new words that have appeared, or words whose meanings have changed, since the division of the peninsula after World War II.)
 Last year, the activity here expanded trade between the Koreas to more than $1 billion for the first time, though only a few companies here are believed to be profitable.
 Kaesong has also become an obstacle in negotiations between South Korea and the United States over a free-trade agreement. The South wants products made here to be included in the agreement, arguing, so far in vain, that most of the materials derive from the South.
 The Bush administration, which has tried to isolate the North instead of engaging it, recently criticized Kaesong after long withholding judgment. It accused the South of economically propping up the North, as the United States was financially squeezing the North elsewhere.
 In a recent op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal, Jay Lefkowitz, President Bush's special envoy for human rights in North Korea, said projects like Kaesong strengthened Kim Jong-il by pumping ''hundreds of millions of dollars into the North, with more to come.'' Mr. Lefkowitz also said he had doubts about whether the North Korean workers actually got their wages.
 Mr. Ko, of the Unification Ministry, rejected such accusations, saying the North Korean workers had to sign their names when they received their wages. The wages average $57 a month, nearly triple the average in the North, he said.
 According to Hyundai Asan, employees work 48 hours a week. They were picked by North Korean officials, then approved by South Koreans. About 80 percent are high school graduates.
 Visitors were allowed to speak freely to the North Korean workers, but the presence of supervisors and North Korean guides on the tour discouraged anything but innocuous answers. 
 Peter M. Beck, who is the Northeast Asia director for the International Crisis Group in Seoul and took part in the tour, said that he was impressed by the facilities but that it was still unclear how much of the wages went to the workers.
 At Shinwon, a garment manufacturer, 300 North Korean workers were cutting and sewing shirts, dresses and blouses in a large, brightly lighted, air-conditioned factory.
 ''I've seen factories of this type in Kenya, Bangladesh, India and Papua New Guinea, and the conditions here compare very favorably,'' said Frank Gamble, a retired banker and an official with the Australia-New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, as he toured the Shinwon factory. ''What South Korea is trying to do here in Kaesong, we've already seen in China and Vietnam and elsewhere. The United States was against investing in Vietnam, but now they're beating down doors to get there.''
 A North Korean official accompanying the visitors expressed anger at criticism from Americans.
 ''I think they're ignorant,'' he said, refusing to give his name. ''They just criticize everybody, including China on human rights. They just want to impose their standards on the world.''

HEADLINE: In Israel's North, Waiting Out Rocket Attacks

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: NAHARIYA, Israel, July 17 

 BODY:
As members of the Siboni family whiled away Monday afternoon in lawn chairs just outside their bomb shelter, knitting, smoking and reading the Torah, Hezbollah's rockets suddenly fell with their signature thump.
 ''Go inside, go inside,'' advised Talia Siboni, age 2, who was clutching her doll. ''This really scares me.''
The family swiftly complied, and over the next hour the thunder of eight crashing rockets was audible in this coastal town, several miles south of the Lebanese border. 
 With Hezbollah firing rockets on northern Israel for a sixth straight day on Monday -- including one that destroyed part of an apartment building in nearby Haifa -- tens of thousands of Israelis in the region remained holed up in bomb shelters that, while apparently rocket-proof, are hot and uncomfortable.
 In this part of the country, where Hezbollah rockets have been a threat for decades, taking cover in bomb shelters has become as commonplace as bracing for a hurricane is in Florida.
 This time, many families have evacuated to the south, waiting out the fighting with relatives. Of the 12 families in the Sibonis' four-story apartment building, 9 have left.
 But Shlomo Siboni, a 45-year-old retired army major, offered a typical Israeli response when asked why his family was staying: ''This is my home. Why should I leave? And besides, something could happen to you anywhere in this country.''
 The shelters are simple concrete boxes with minimal facilities that usually include bunk beds that fold out from the walls, a toilet and a sink. Electricity allows for cooking on a hot plate, watching television and running a fan.
 The Sibonis use a shelter on the ground floor of their building, though most are typically in basements. Most larger apartment buildings have their own shelters, and local governments also provide them.
 As the days drag on, tedium sets in, increasing the temptation to spend time outside, particularly for restless children. Mr. Siboni said that he made occasional trips to the store, and that the family had been going upstairs at night to sleep in their third-floor apartment.
 When two rockets suddenly landed back-to-back in the distance, Talia offered her own analysis: ''The eggs are breaking, the eggs are breaking.''
 Mr. Siboni said he and his wife, Kathy, tried to explain the rockets to Talia by saying they were falling eggs that belonged to the egg delivery man. For now, Talia seems to accept that, though she periodically asks, ''How do the eggs fly?''
 Ms. Siboni's sister and her family of five visit each summer from Los Angeles for a month or more, and this year they arrived just in time for the rocket barrage. After two days, they retreated to the safety of Tel Aviv and are planning to return home, Ms. Siboni said.
 As the rockets hit Monday, the family was joined in the shelter by their neighbor, Avraham Daniel. He was praying in a nearby synagogue last Thursday when a Katyusha landed outside, shattering the windows and showering him with glass.
 ''They took a few pieces of glass out of my head at the hospital and told me to stay and lie down, but I came home,'' said Mr. Daniel, 60.
 A grown daughter has urged him to stay with her in Tel Aviv, a little over an hour away by car and out of rocket range. But Mr. Daniel has refused.
 ''I've lived in this apartment for 35 years,'' he said. ''I'm a Katyusha veteran. I know how to take care of myself.''
 Communities in northern Israel have a well-developed game plan for helping their residents when the rockets fall. The town hall in Nahariya has a 24-hour hot line, and municipal workers in flak jackets carry food, water, medicine and even diapers to families running low on supplies in the shelters. The elderly are transported to senior citizens' homes in safer regions.
 The town also organizes activities inside the shelters. Singers from around the country give impromptu concerts. Artists set up craft centers for painting and woodworking. Soldiers are sent to entertain children.
 ''Unfortunately, we are all too familiar with this,'' said Galia Mor, a spokeswoman for Nahariya, which has about 60,000 residents.
 While communities farther north have had bomb shelters for many years, the government ordered all homes in Israel to have safe rooms after the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when Iraq fired dozens of Scud missiles into the country.
 Still, the past two days have brought an ominous new development, with Hezbollah firing rockets much more powerful than the Katyushas it has been launching for more than two decades.
 Since Sunday, at least 20 rockets have hit in or near Haifa, a major port and Israel's third largest city, which is about 20 miles south of the border. While many homes in Haifa have some kind of bomb shelter arrangement, the city had never been hit until last Thursday.
 On Sunday, one of the new rockets killed 8 workers and wounded 20 at a maintenance building in the railroad yard in Haifa. On Monday, a rocket slammed into the top floor of a three-story residential building, destroying apartments on all three floors on one side of the building. One person was critically wounded and at least five others were hurt, the police said.
 On Monday, much of Haifa was empty. As Mayor Yona Yahav surveyed the damaged apartment building, he said people did not need to leave the city, but he urged them to remain inside. The city was trying to maintain some semblance of normality and the port was operating, he said. Still, he acknowledged the potential damage to the local economy.
 ''Hundreds of thousands of people come every summer to festivals here,'' Mr. Yahav said. ''Without this, our local economy will be hurting.''

HEADLINE: Some Light At Beginning Of Tunnel For Citigroup

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
There is turmoil in the Middle East and turbulence in the financial markets. Gas prices and interest rates are climbing, while consumer confidence and credit card spending are spiraling downward. The American housing market seems poised for a slowdown or worse. 
 For the big banks, whose fortunes tend to wax and wane with the overall economy, these are challenging times. 
Yet the chief executive of the biggest bank, Charles O. Prince III of Citigroup, sounded a very upbeat note yesterday, saying that he had ''a great deal of optimism and enthusiasm'' about the rest of 2006.
 ''Despite all the turmoil we see on the news and in the markets, Citi delivers,'' he told analysts and investors in a conference call after the bank reported a 4 percent gain in second-quarter earnings. ''We will continue to deliver the kinds of results our owners expect from us.'' 
 Others are more skeptical, particularly after Citigroup again missed Wall Street's expectations, the fourth time in the last five quarters that it has done so. Shares of Citigroup fell 2.5 percent in trading yesterday, its sharpest one-day decline since January.
 The gains and optimism at Citigroup, as well as those that are likely to come from its rivals Bank of America and J. P. Morgan Chase, which also report quarterly earnings this week, may obscure the difficulty of the challenges ahead.
 A slowdown in consumer spending, as last week's retail sales report indicated, would dampen credit card profits. Fewer homes being sold and new ones being constructed mean fewer mortgages to sell. Rising interest rates and more intense competition have reduced lending margins. The turbulent capital markets, meanwhile, are causing investors to stay on the sidelines, lowering fee income and proprietary trading gains.
 While a downturn in the economy might cause the big banks' profits to dip, it is unlikely to sink them altogether. They are diversified enough that weaknesses in one business are often offset by strengths in another. They have strong balance sheets. And they can offer a wider range of products to their customers than their regional bank peers. The upshot is that many analysts see big banks swallowing up smaller rivals in a wave of new deals.
 But first, the big banks have their own issues to resolve. At Bank of America, for example, it is building out its investment bank while merging MBNA's loan portfolio and customer base with its existing consumer operations. For J. P. Morgan Chase, it is improving six core businesses after years of poor performance and a dismal rate of return on equity compared to its peers. At Citigroup, it has been transforming a company focused on acquisitions into one that is focused on expanding its existing businesses and its operations overseas.
 Over the last year, Mr. Prince has led a sweeping overhaul of Citigroup's strategy. He has encouraged more cooperation among the bank's business units and ramped up investment in its retail operations, opening more than 500 new branches worldwide in the last six months and introducing a new high-yield savings account online. And he has gradually put his own stamp on the company, tightening internal controls as part of a bold plan to resolve Citigroup's run-ins with regulators as well as more subtle efforts to update its brand image and install his own management team.
 But Wall Street has yet to embrace all the changes. Citigroup's stock has been essentially flat since Mr. Prince took over as chief executive. Its shares closed yesterday at $46.40, down $1.18.
 The underlying financial results have also been mixed. Expenses, which outpaced revenue growth in the second quarter, remain high. And while yesterday's earnings showed glimmers of good news, they also hinted at trouble brewing.
 Citigroup earned $5.27 billion, or $1.05 a share, in the second quarter, up from 5.07 billion, or 91 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $22.2 billion.
 Citigroup's corporate and investing businesses earned $1.7 billion, 26 percent above second-quarter levels last year, and revenue of $6.8 billion, a gain of 31 percent. Investment banking advisory fees were strong. And the early spring's tidal wave of trading revenues in both the global fixed-income and equity markets led the business to generate near-record revenue, even as investors pulled back from the market in late May and June. 
 ''This quarter was our second-best quarter despite the challenging conditions coming out of the emerging markets,'' Mr. Prince said in the conference call.
 But with market volatility still up and trading volumes still down, Citigroup's chief financial officer, Sallie L. Krawcheck, acknowledged the challenges ahead. While the investment bank's deal ''pipeline is at record levels,'' she said, any rate volatility or uncertainty will have a ''measurable impact'' on results.
 Trading could also be negatively affected. ''There will be opportunity to make money on volatility, but clearly if there is lower volume, it is difficult to make money,'' she added.
 Citigroup's consumer businesses show a similar pattern. Once again, the international consumer businesses generated double-digit increases in profits. Net income rose to $1.2 billion, up 10 percent over the second quarter in 2005.
 Citigroup's United States consumer businesses, meanwhile, posted $2.1 billion in second-quarter profits, an 11 percent increase from 2005. But much of the gain could be attributed to the sale of its upstate New York retail banking branches, the release of loan loss reserves and a large gain from the MasterCard initial public offering.
 Credit card revenue remained flat, even as the industry over all saw single-digit growth. Consumer lending profits were down 7 percent, as higher interest rates put pressure on revenues and profit margins. And the full impact of Citigroup's retail branch-building effort, an expensive endeavor, will not be realized for some time.
 ''We thought we saw baby steps this quarter,'' Ms. Krawcheck said in a news briefing. ''Before you start to grow, you have to stop shrinking. And after a fourth quarter and first quarter that were very tough, we feel better. By no means are we doing backflips down the halls.''
 Besides, Ms. Krawcheck added, growth in deposits, loans and investment sales were all trending upward, a sign that the bank was both growing and deepening its interaction with customers.
 Profit will improve as credit quality declines and margin pressure abates. ''The reason financial services have outperformed on earnings is because of some of the natural breaks and hedges,'' she said in an interview. ''When a yield curve steepens, that balance sheet growth will translate into revenue growth.''

HEADLINE: Blue Chips Up a Bit but Most Others Sag 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose slightly yesterday, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped as a drop in oil prices hurt energy shares and Citigroup reported earnings just short of Wall Street's forecasts.
 Shares of McDonald's and Boeing shot higher, helping the Dow average. 
McDonald's announced preliminary quarterly earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. Boeing shares were helped by news that its rival Airbus will have to spend $10 billion to revamp its planned A350 midsize jet.
 United States crude oil for August delivery fell more than $1 on Monday but stayed above $75 a barrel as traders continued to monitor Israel's offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 ''The market is in no man's land,'' said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company in New York. ''With the violence in the Middle East and lack of stellar results from some big companies, there's no incentive for bargain-hunting.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 8.01 points, or 0.07 percent, to end at 10,747.36. The S.& P. 500 slipped 1.71 points, or 0.14 percent, to finish at 1,234.49. The Nasdaq composite index ended essentially flat, up just 0.37 point, or 0.02 percent, to close at 2,037.72.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were unchanged in price at 100 15/32 for a yield of 5.06 percent.
 Shares of Citigroup were the biggest drag on both the Dow and the S.& P. 500. Citigroup dropped 2.5 percent, or $1.18, to $46.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. Prudential cut its rating on Citigroup's stock to ''neutral weight'' from ''overweight.''
 Citigroup's downgrade prompted investors to sell shares of some other banks, sending J. P. Morgan Chase stock down 0.4 percent, or 16 cents, to $40.73.
 Exxon Mobil shares slid 1.4 percent, or 90 cents, to $64, after a sharp drop in oil prices.
 United States crude oil for August delivery fell $1.73 to settle at $75.30 a barrel, down from a record high of $78.40 on Friday.
 McDonald's shares climbed 5.1 percent, or $1.68, to $34.72, while Boeing's stock jumped 2.2 percent, or $1.70, to $78.95.
 Shares of Apple Computer were up 3.4 percent, or $1.70, to $52.37 after a report in Barron's on Sunday that the stock could rebound over the next year as interest in its Macintosh computers picks up.
 Analysts said a stronger-than-expected increase in June industrial output, reported yesterday morning by the Federal Reserve, suggested that economic growth was strong enough to sustain profit growth.
 Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.48 billion shares changed hands, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On Nasdaq, about 1.55 billion shares traded, below the 1.80 billion daily average last year.
 On the New York Stock Exchange, declining shares outnumbered those advancing by about seven to five, while on Nasdaq about nine stocks fell for every five that rose.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills.



(000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.744	97.426	High Rate	4.965	5.090	Investment Rate	5.098	5.297	Low Rate	4.940	5.065	Median Rate	4.955	5.075	Total applied for	$44,452,779	$38,840,487	Accepted	$23,275,127	$20,106,962	Noncompetitive	$2,096,693	$1,964,902	


Both issues are dated July 20, 2006. The three-month bills mature on Oct. 19, 2006 and the six-month bills mature on Jan. 18, 2007.

HEADLINE: Trash Plan Could Be Ready For Council Vote Today 

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Nearly two years after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled his ambitious plan to take care of the city's mountainous garbage problem, the finishing touches are being put to a draft that is scheduled for a vote by the City Council tomorrow if the final details can be worked out. 
 While the bruising political battle over the broad outlines of the plan to shift the transport of trash from trucks to rail and barges is just about over, more than two dozen issues remain to be resolved, according to officials close to the negotiations. Some are considered relatively straightforward, like setting a long-range goal for reducing the 50,000 tons of commercial and residential trash produced in the city every day. But other issues may represent obstacles serious enough to cause the vote to be delayed. 
One of the most controversial issues is use of a container-handling terminal on Staten Island as a major transfer point for up to 375 containers a day packed with the city's trash. 
 Under the mayor's plan, garbage collected from city streets would be taken to four marine transfer stations where it would be stuffed into shipping containers and loaded on barges. The barges would then be taken to the Howland Hook container terminal on Staten Island for transfer to rail cars or seagoing barges that will take the trash to out-of-state landfills. 
 The proposal is creating a split among some Staten Island officials. The Staten Island borough president, James P. Molinaro, enthusiastically supports the use of Howland Hook because of the jobs and economic activity the operation would produce. ''It's a good idea for the economy of Staten Island,'' Mr. Molinaro said in a telephone interview. ''I don't see anything wrong with it.'' 
 But Councilman Michael E. McMahon of Staten Island, chairman of the Sanitation Committee, wants to strictly limit the number of containers so that Staten Island handles only a portion of them. ''It would be a terrible mistake to send all the containers to one potential chokehold, because if there is any problem with the operations, the entire system would come to a halt,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''It's also not appropriate for Staten Islanders to see all of the city's waste back on Staten Island's shores.''
 For more than 50 years, the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island was the final destination for much of New York's garbage, creating a smelly mountain that borough officials tried for years to close. It was finally shut in 2001, and the city has shipped its garbage out of state. 
 Mr. Molinaro said he expected the city to include safeguards in the plan to ensure that any commercial operator contracted to handle the trash-filled containers has an alternative to Howland Hook that could be used in an emergency. He also said that the containers would not stay at the terminal for very long because city environmental laws would prohibit them from being kept there for more than 72 hours. 
 Mr. McMahon, who grew up in the shadow of the Fresh Kills landfill, said that he was not sure the issue could be resolved before tomorrow's scheduled vote in the council. ''I'm less optimistic than I was a day or two ago,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''But we continue to engage in discussions to see that a vote happens either this week or by September at the outside.''
 Edward Skyler, deputy mayor for administration, declined to talk about the current negotiations but he said they have been ''both extensive and productive.'' 
 ''We remain optimistic that the Council will pass the plan,'' Mr. Skyler said. 
 Several of the other issues still to be resolved also address measures to ensure that no neighborhood in the city is forced to bear an inequitable share of the burden for the city's solid waste problem. Negotiators discussed ways of mitigating with visual and sound barriers the increased truck traffic in communities that will have the four marine transfer stations. Two of the stations will be in Brooklyn, with the others in Queens and Manhattan, at East 91st Street. 
 Mr. McMahon said there has also been discussion of ways to protect neighborhoods that have commercial waste transfer stations that will continue to operate even after the new marine terminals are opened. 
 Some progress was reported on demands by the Council and several environmental and community groups that an independent office of recycling be created outside the Department of Sanitation, which is responsible for running the city's controversial recycling program. 
 In the past, the sanitation department has been a reluctant steward of the program, arguing so effectively against it that in 2002 the mayor suspended the pickup of glass jars and bottles, and the following year reduced recycling collection to a bimonthly schedule. 
 The full recycling program was restored in 2004, but sanitation officials still grumbled that it costs far more to have a crew picking up recyclables than to simply haul everything to a landfill. 
 Proponents of an independent recycling office said it was essential for the city in the long run to reduce the amount of trash that is ultimately sent to out-of-state landfills.
 ''We need to reduce our waste exports,'' said Jean Halloran, director of food and sustainability issues at Consumers Union, which is part of the Zero Waste citizens campaign for reduction of the waste produced in the city. ''Those waste exports are costing the city $300 million a year, and those costs are only going to go up,'' she said. 
 Mr. McMahon said there was general agreement to move oversight of the recycling program from the Department of Sanitation to the Council on the Environment, which advises the mayor on environmental policy. The amount of staff and a budget for the new office are still under discussion.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 17 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations called Monday for an international force in southern Lebanon to end the fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah militia, which continued for a sixth deadly day.
 The United States and Israel reacted skeptically, with President Bush urging tartly that Mr. Annan telephone President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a key sponsor of Hezbollah, ''and make something happen.'' In Russia for a Group of 8 summit meeting, Mr. Bush expressed his views to Mr. Blair, using a vulgarity that was caught by an open microphone.
With the Lebanese death toll exceeding 200 and the Israeli count at 24, the increased efforts to turn to diplomacy showed little prospect of an immediate way out. In Lebanon, a vast majority of those killed were civilians, while in Israel about half of the dead were civilians.
 In a televised speech to the Israeli Parliament, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert vowed to continue the offensive until Hezbollah freed two captured Israeli soldiers, the Lebanese Army was deployed along the border, and Hezbollah was effectively disarmed. Hezbollah has consistently rejected those terms. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will travel to the Middle East to try to resolve the crisis, Bush administration officials said. The timing is still up in the air, and the trip will be a gamble. Israel's ambassador to the United States, Daniel Ayalon, said on CNN that it might be too soon for Ms. Rice to accomplish anything.
 Israel intensified its bombing across Lebanon on Monday, hitting an army barracks in Tripoli and bases in Baalbek, both in the north. It shelled fuel tanks in Beirut's port and continued pounding southern Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs. In the afternoon, Israel made a brief ground raid into Lebanon.
 Israeli military officials said they succeeded in hitting a rocket launcher in Beirut carrying one of Hezbollah's longest-range rockets, an Iranian Zelzal, with a range of 62 to 124 miles. The attack caused the rocket to flare in the air, leading to reports that an Israeli plane might have been shot down.
 At least 43 Lebanese were killed Monday, according to Lebanese authorities, raising the toll to more than 200 since the Israeli offensive began Thursday. In one large group of fatalities, a missile hit a minibus, killing 12 civilians as they were driving through Rmeileh, a seaside town south of Beirut.
 [Early Tuesday, Israeli warplanes pounded south Lebanon, killing six members of a family in Aytaroun village, Reuters reported.]
 Some 30 rockets fired by Hezbollah hit Haifa and other parts of northern Israel. One rocket leveled much of an apartment house, critically wounding one person. Another Hezbollah rocket landed next to a hospital in Safed, slightly wounding six people. 
 Israel's rejection of an international force stems partly from recent history. The foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, said in an interview that such a force must be able to intervene, unlike the current troops, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or Unifil, which was established in 1978.
 ''We have an experience with Unifil,'' she said: When an Israeli was seized previously, ''they just watched.''
 The Israeli military wants to continue its largely aerial campaign against Hezbollah, with one senior Israeli official suggesting that Hezbollah's capacity to launch missiles had already been degraded ''about 30 percent.''
 Brig. Gen. Ido Nehushtan, on the Israeli general staff, said, ''We have damaged Hezbollah but they still have significant operational capacity.'' He noted the decline in rockets launched into Israel in the last two days -- an average of 40 a day, down from initial highs of 150 -- and said it was a testament to the damage caused by the Israelis. 
 ''It will take time, it's more than a matter of days on the military side,'' he said. ''We aim to change the situation and not go back to where we are.''
 Israel's deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Moshe Kaplinski, told Agence France-Presse: ''The operation will last for at least another week. The international pressure on Israel will allow us to continue for another week at least.'' 
 In his speech, Prime Minister Olmert said, ''The terrorist organizations we are fighting take their orders from the Tehran-Damascus axis of evil.'' He said Israel would continue to fight until both Hezbollah and Hamas stopped attacks on Israel.
 ''In Lebanon, we will fight to enforce the demands long voiced by the international community,'' he said. He demanded ''an absolute end to fire'' from Hezbollah, ''the deployment of the Lebanese Army all along the southern border, and the departure of Hezbollah from this region and fulfillment of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559.''
 That resolution calls for the pullout of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the disbanding and disarmament of all militias and the deployment of the Lebanese Army on the border. But the Security Council included no provisions to implement the agreement, and the Lebanese government, which contains some Hezbollah ministers, is considered too weak to do so.
 Hezbollah is supported by Iran and Syria, and Mr. Bush's pungent conclusion, as he summarized it to Mr. Blair in Russia was, ''What they need to do is get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this shit, and it's over.''
 The current conflict began when Hezbollah fighters crossed into Israel and captured two Israeli soldiers on July 12, and Israel immediately attacked Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, calling the initial incursion an act of war. Hezbollah, a radical Shiite group, was established with Iranian help in 1982 to fight Israel, and both Iran and Syria supply the group with money and weaponry.
 ''Israel is making it possible for the Lebanese government to move in,'' Foreign Minister Livni said. ''In a way, Israel is doing the Lebanese government's job for it'' by taking on Hezbollah, which has been a state-within-a-state in southern Lebanon and southern Beirut.
 ''Israel shares the same goals as the international community, and for us the best option is full implementation of 1559,'' Ms. Livni said. ''That's the way out of this crisis, and now is the time to implement it.'' 
 It was a great accomplishment to get the Syrians largely out of Lebanon, she said, but there is more to do. ''The Syrians have left,'' she said, ''but they have a kind of branch in Lebanon, and Hezbollah keeps an open front for Iran with Israel.''
 At the United Nations, the Security Council went into its third session on Lebanon in four days, but beforehand John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, discouraged talk of a multilateral force. Three questions must be addressed, he said: ''Would such a force be empowered to deal with the real problem? The real problem is Hezbollah. Would it be empowered to deal with countries like Syria and Iran that support Hezbollah?''
 Third, he said, was how a new force would improve on Unifil or help strengthen Lebanese institutions.
 Asked why the United States was not backing an immediate cease-fire, he said, ''We could have a cease-fire in a matter of nanoseconds if Hezbollah and Hamas would release their kidnap victims and would stop engaging in rocket attacks and other acts of terrorism against Israel.''
 A United Nations mission dispatched by Mr. Annan to the region will make its first visit to Israel on Friday and return to report at the end of the week.
 Initially, Mr. Olmert refused to see the team, but changed his mind after Ms. Livni argued that a robust international force that could enforce Resolution 1559, blessed by the United Nations, would be an opportunity for Israel to be seen on the right side of international legitimacy.
 The Lebanese prime minister, Fouad Siniora, met with Mr. Annan's team and said afterward, ''We don't want to talk about any steps before they become concrete, and I want to assure the Lebanese people that we are exerting all possible efforts to resolve the crisis.''
 Michael Young, a Lebanese political analyst, said: ''The Israelis are creating a humanitarian and social and economic crisis. But there is also a great deal of anger in the country at Hezbollah for inviting disaster on Lebanon.'' 
 Officials in Washington said an attack on Friday on an Israeli naval vessel by a C-802 anti-ship cruise missile was Hezbollah's most sophisticated to date. Given that advanced radar is needed to guide a C-802 to its target, Israeli officials have accused the Lebanese military of directly aiding Hezbollah fighters, and Israeli jets struck several radar targets in Lebanon over the weekend.
 Of the 13,000 missiles and rockets estimated to be in Hezbollah's arsenal, about 11,000 are believed to have been shipped from Iran. Western intelligence officials also say Syria has armed Hezbollah with short- and medium-range rockets, some of which have been used in the current attacks on Israel.
 Western governments were rushing to set up evacuation plans for thousands of foreigners living in Lebanon or on vacation there. British military helicopters started carrying some out of Lebanon on Monday. A Greek passenger ferry chartered by the French government reached Beirut Monday afternoon and loaded about 1,200 people before heading for Cyprus. Norway, Sweden, Italy and Ukraine also started organizing the departure of their citizens.
 The United States is planning to start evacuating its citizens on Tuesday. The embassy said there was no mandatory evacuation. There are 8,000 Americans registered with the embassy, but the number of Americans or Lebanese also holding American citizenship could be three times larger.
 At the Pentagon on Monday, officials said a commercial passenger ship had been contracted to ferry Americans from Lebanon to Cyprus. Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the ship, the Orient Queen, would be able to carry 750 passengers at a time on the five-hour trip.
 A Navy destroyer would be available to escort the ship, Mr. Whitman said.
 By early Monday, 64 Americans, designated by the embassy as having special needs, had been evacuated by Marine helicopters.
 In front of the French Consulate in Beirut, stranded tourists and foreign residents lugged their bags and lined up to register for evacuation. 
 ''I'm worried this may drag on, and I'm leaving,'' said Souad Mehdi, 32, a French citizen on vacation with her two sons. ''My heart and thoughts are still here with my family and friends. I am scared I won't see them again.''

HEADLINE: Airbus Offers Up Redesigned A350 in a Challenge to Boeing

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FARNBOROUGH, England, July 17 

 BODY:
Airbus thought seriously of calling it the A280, a deliberate echo of the A380, the troubled giant that is the biggest passenger jet ever made. But the midsize plane it announced here on Monday goes by the name A350 XWB -- as in ''extra wide body.''
 Airbus promoted the plane, which will carry from 250 to 375 passengers, as the linchpin of its recovery. Avoiding too many associations with the A380 may have been wise: costly delays in deliveries of the superjumbo plane plunged Airbus into the most serious crisis in its history. 
''Customers and future customers told Airbus they wanted something extra,'' said Christian Streiff, the chief executive of Airbus, at a news conference at the Farnborough International Air Show. The A350, he said, has an ''entirely new and uncompromised design.''
 Preserving the A350 name is a reminder that this is not a wholly new plane, but a redesign of the earlier A350, which had disappointed airlines and seemed likely to be an also-ran to Boeing's 787. Airbus contends that the new, improved version surpasses the 787 in several respects, not least its cabin, which is five inches wider than the cabin of the Boeing plane. The debut of the XWB dominated the first day of the air show, with competitors and analysts debating its merits.
 ''It doesn't have the splash of the 787, but splash is only part of the story,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace research firm in Fairfax, Va. ''Given the circumstances, they're going after the right part of the market, and they're doing it in a smart way.''
 The new plane will cost $10 billion to develop, roughly double the budget of the original A350. Airbus finances some of the cost of its new planes with loans backed by European governments -- a practice that started a trade battle between the United States and the European Union.
 Mr. Streiff declined to specify how Airbus planned to pay for this one, saying he did not want to fan the flames of that dispute.
 Airbus is actually aiming at two Boeing jets with the A350: the 787 and the 777, which is larger and can fly very long routes -- between Los Angeles and Singapore, for example. In the last year, the 777 crushed the long-range A340 in orders, giving Airbus little choice but to replace it.
 With a fuselage a foot wider than the old A350's, Airbus said it would be able to offer passengers the same, or greater, levels of comfort as the 787. The plane will have the ''widest windows in the industry,'' said John Leahy, the chief commercial officer of Airbus.
 Humidity in the cabin will be adjusted to 20 percent, in contrast to 15 percent on the 787 and less than 10 percent on existing planes. The level of humidity, as well as the temperature, can be varied, depending on whether passengers are seated in economy, business or first class.
 ''We're taking the time to come up with an aircraft that is a step ahead of the 787,'' Mr. Leahy said.
 Boeing seemed unruffled by the A350, noting it would not enter service until 2012, four years after the 787. While the plane will have a wider cabin than the 787, it will be narrower than the 777.
 By trying to straddle too much of the market with a single plane, Boeing said Airbus would wind up with a plane that is less economical for the airlines. ''It's a big chunk of territory to try to cover with one plane,'' said Michael B. Bair, who heads the 787 program. 
 Boeing also noted that the plane would have an aluminum fuselage, not one made of advanced composite materials, like the 787. ''It sounds like it's going to fall short of the available technology,'' said Randy Baseler, vice president for marketing at Boeing's commercial aircraft division.
 Finally, Airbus does not plan to build an A350 with fewer than 250 seats, ceding that market to the 787. Boeing says there are 1,500 planes of that size, which airlines will have to replace in coming years.
 For all the criticisms, the Airbus announcement puts the company back into the game against Boeing. Mr. Leahy can now begin selling the A350 to carriers, which have been withholding orders or switching to Boeing out of frustration with what some perceived as an inferior design.
 Mr. Streiff said he met Monday with one of the most outspoken critics, Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, the chairman of the International Lease Finance Corporation, a major aircraft leasing company and customer of Airbus. ''We had a long, very positive, very tough conversation,'' he said.
 Analysts had speculated that Airbus might rename the plane A370, to emphasize its new design. But people at the company said the second choice had been to call it A280 -- a nod to its shared technology with the A380. In the end, though, Airbus merely added to its original name.
 Even the old A350 managed to lure 100 firm orders. Mr. Leahy said he expected only one or two airlines to cancel those orders. The rest will be switched over to the new plane. The plane comes in three sizes, with catalog prices of $186 million, $215 million and $242 million, he said.

HEADLINE: Republicans Coming Up Short in Effort to Reach Out to African-American Voters

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17 

 BODY:
Even for some Republicans, the notion was hard to take at face value: the Republican Party would make an explicit play for black votes, a strike at the Democratic base and a part of a larger White House plan to achieve long-term Republican dominance.
 Starting after President Bush's re-election in 2004, the party chairman, Ken Mehlman, filled his schedule with appearances before black audiences. He apologized for what he described as the racially polarized politics of some Republicans over the past 25 years. And the White House, in pressing issues like same-sex marriage to appeal to social conservatives, was also hoping to gain support among churchgoing African-Americans.
There has been no end to speculation about what the party was up to. Was it simply a ploy to improve the party's image with moderate white voters? Did the White House see an opportunity to make small though significant changes in the American political system by pulling even a relative few black voters into its corner in important states like Ohio? (Yes, and yes.) 
 But as Mr. Bush is tentatively scheduled to speak at the N.A.A.C.P. convention in Washington this week -- after five years of declining to appear before an organization with which he has had tense relations -- it seems fair to say that whatever the motivation, the effort has faltered. 
 Mr. Mehlman's much-publicized apology to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People seems to have done little to address the resentment that built up over what civil rights leaders view as decades of racial politics practiced or countenanced by Republicans. One example they point to is the first President Bush's use of the escape of Willie Horton, a black convicted murderer, to portray his Democratic opponent in the 1988 election, Michael S. Dukakis, as soft on crime.
 That perception of Republicans as insensitive to racial issues was fed again by the opposition mounted by some House conservatives to an extension of the Voting Rights Act. The House approved the extension last week.
 ''I have heard Ken Mehlman talk about the Republican Party as the party of Lincoln,'' said Bruce S. Gordon, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. ''I have not seen that evidence itself as much as Ken would suggest. If the party wishes to reflect the principles of Lincoln, it has a long way to go.''
 Coming as the immigration fight on Capitol Hill has undercut Republican efforts to appeal to Hispanic voters, the disappointing results of the outreach to black voters is bad news for a White House that once viewed the 2002 and 2004 elections as a platform to achieve a long-term shift in the balance of power between the two parties. Forcing Democrats to fight to hold on to black voters and Hispanic voters was a crucial part of that strategy.
 ''I take my hat off to Ken; what he has done is unprecedented in the time I've been a Republican,'' said J. C. Watts Jr., a former congressman from Oklahoma, who is black. ''However, I remain unconvinced that it is in the DNA of our party to get it done. There are just too many things out there that I think Americans of African descent have concerns about.''
 Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, who attended Harvard Law School with Mr. Mehlman and who is black, said: ''Ken was sincere in wanting to reach out to the African-American community, and it would be a healthy thing if both parties actively competed for the African-American vote. Unfortunately, the agenda of the Republican Party keeps getting in the way of that outreach.''
 For all the emphasis that Mr. Mehlman has put on this drive, Mr. Bush -- who is highly unpopular among blacks -- has not made this effort a public priority of his administration, though Mr. Mehlman said the president shared his desire to expand the party's appeal to blacks.
 In an interview, Mr. Mehlman played down the effect of the delay in approving the extension to the Voting Rights Act. He noted that the party had black candidates running in statewide races in four states this fall, and that he always viewed the effort as a long and steady climb.
 ''As I said from the day I started this,'' Mr. Mehlman said, ''there are going to be ups and there are going to be downs -- this is going to be a difficult process. It took the Republican Party 40 years, since 1964, to get 8 percent of the vote.''
 He argued that Republican advocacy of economic policies that would give more power to individuals rather than to government -- like health saving accounts -- would appeal to middle-class black voters as much as it would to whites. 
 ''What we have today that we had less of 10 years ago is a strong and powerful message,'' Mr. Mehlman said, ''and we have candidates.'' 
 Lynn Swann, an African-American Republican running for governor in Pennsylvania, argued that his own candidacy showed the extent to which the Republican Party was becoming more diverse and that the debate about the Voting Rights Act extension did not distract from that.
 ''I don't think it undercuts it -- people make mistakes,'' Mr. Swann said. ''I think of Senator Al Gore Sr., who is on record for one of the longest filibusters against the Civil Rights Act when it was first initiated. And he's a Democrat.''
 Whether the Republican effort ever had much of a chance is open to debate. Donna Brazile, a prominent black Democratic strategist, initially warned Democrats to take Mr. Mehlman's efforts seriously, but Ms. Brazile said last week that any progress he and the White House had been making ended with the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina last year.
 ''He was on a roll, but Katrina stopped him in his tracks,'' Ms. Brazile said of Mr. Mehlman. ''They are eager to tap into the political support of the African-American community, but they don't have any legs to stand on.''
 The central problem for Republicans is that Mr. Mehlman's very visible effort to reach out to African-Americans ran into the wall of historical trends that had pushed blacks toward the Democratic Party and Republicans more to the right. 
 ''You have someone stand up one day and say, 'We're going to make a major outreach to African-American voters,' and the next day, you pull the Voting Rights Act from the floor,'' said Representative Melvin Watt, Democrat of North Carolina and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
 As evidence of what has become one of the hallmark initiatives of Mr. Mehlman's chairmanship, his office said he had made 48 visits to African-American audiences since becoming chairman in January 2005. At the same time, Republican strategists have appealed to socially conservative blacks by emphasizing social issues like same-sex marriage.
 Mr. Watts, the former Republican congressman, called that a ''lame strategy'' and said the top concerns of African-American voters were racial and economic issues.
 ''It's a little bit insulting to all those pastors out there and people who stand with the party on the social issues,'' Mr. Watts said, when the party then does ''nothing'' to help blacks on opportunity issues. 
 David A. Bositis, senior political analyst with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonpartisan Washington group that studies black issues, said of the Republican effort: ''They haven't had any success. But I thought all along it was never going to be realistic.''

HEADLINE: Bush's Policy Chit-Chat: Undiplomatic Prose 

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: STRELNA, Russia, July 17 

 BODY:
For anyone who has ever wondered what President Bush sounds like when the microphones are off, the answer, at least at lunchtime on Monday, was blunt to the point of profane, laced with a wiseguy edge and, like anyone forced to make small talk, willing to fall back on safe topics like air travel.
 Mr. Bush was munching on a roll during lunch with his fellow world leaders on the final day of the Group of 8 summit meeting here as his unguarded comments were picked up by an open microphone and overheard by gleeful journalists. 
Whether the cause was poor staff work by the Russian hosts or something more calculated, the result was more interesting and revealing than the catalog of official statements the leaders had issued during their talks here in this St. Petersburg suburb, at the Konstantinovsky Palace.
 Using a vulgarity, Mr. Bush said at one point that Syria should get Hezbollah to stop its attacks on Israel, describing American policy in the kind of unfettered language that he acknowledged only weeks ago sometimes gets him in trouble when he uses it publicly.
 Discussing diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, Mr. Bush said the approach favored by Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, ''seems odd.'' Referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Mr. Bush said he ''felt like telling Kofi to get on the phone with Assad, make something happen.''
 The microphone caught him discussing global trade talks, his impatience with long speeches, even his preference for Diet Coke. For four minutes, the world was given an unscripted look at how he does business with his international counterparts, especially Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who, apparently alert to the peril, brought the episode to a conclusion by turning the microphone off.
 But not before Mr. Bush disclosed that he would send Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to the Middle East and needled Mr. Blair about a recent birthday gift.
 ''No, I'm just going to make it up,'' Mr. Bush said in one aside, presumably to an aide, apparently referring to remarks he would be making to the other leaders. ''I'm not going to talk too damn long like the rest of them. Some of these guys talk too long.''
 Ms. Rice was subject to a similar unwitting public airing of her views last month in Moscow, when someone forgot to turn off a microphone while she was having lunch with Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister. 
 Mr. Bush's unscripted side has been put on public display before, as when his unflattering description of a reporter for The New York Times was picked up by a microphone at one of his campaign events in 2000. 
 But this one caught him in interactions with other leaders, mixing the banal with matters of war and peace. Those at the lunch were the leaders of the Group of 8 industrial nations -- France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Russia, Britain, Italy and Canada -- as well as those of China, India and Brazil, among others.
 [Asked about the incident later aboard Air Force One as Mr. Bush flew home, Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, said the president's ''reaction first was, 'What did it say?' So we showed him the transcript, then he rolled his eyes and laughed.'' Mr. Snow said Mr. Bush ''likes Kofi Annan'' and ''has been supportive from the very start of the U.N. mission to the region.''] 
 In the taped conversation, Mr. Bush, clearly eager to get home to the White House after six days in Europe, is heard saying, apparently to a counterpart, possibly President Hu Jintao of China, who was sitting next to him, possibly President Validimir V. Putin of Russia, his host, ''Good job, gotta keep this thing moving -- I gotta leave at 2:15 -- you'll want me out of town so to free up your security forces.'' His counterpart agrees, ''Ya,'' and he laughs along with Mr. Bush's trademark giggle.
 But Mr. Bush sighs, and explains, ''Gotta go home, got something to do.'' 
 Then, more likely to Mr. Hu, he asks: ''Where you going? Home? This is your neighborhood; it won't take you long to get home.''
 The response cannot be heard, but Mr. Bush exclaims, ''You get home in 8 hours? Me too! Russia is a big country, and you're a big country.'' 
 A moment later, Mr. Bush can be heard saying to a waiter, ''No, not Coke, Diet Coke.''
 But it is around then that Mr. Blair walks by, and the president yells out, ''Yeah, Blair, what are you doing? Leaving?'' It is the beginning of a conversation contrasting Mr. Blair's soft-spoken style to Mr. Bush's more forceful one, with Mr. Bush often interrupting him.
 After Mr. Blair raises the issues of global trade talks, Mr. Bush abruptly changes the subject to a recent gift from the prime minister for Mr. Bush's 60th birthday. ''Thanks for the sweater, awfully thoughtful of you,'' Mr. Bush says, then jokes, ''I know you picked it out yourself.''
 Mr. Blair, laughing, says, ''Oh, absolutely, absolutely.''
 Mr. Bush again abruptly changes the subject to the most serious matter of the meetings here, the Middle East. ''What about Kofi?'' he says, referring to Mr. Annan. ''That seems odd.''
 After a day in which aides stressed they had achieved international unity here on the Middle East violence, Mr. Bush complained about Mr. Annan's approach to the crisis, and for holding a view shared by some of the leaders here that Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah should cease fire and hash out their differences. The Americans have said that Israel will probably stand down only if Hamas and Hezbollah return the soldiers they have captured and cease their shelling of Israeli towns.
 ''I don't like the sequence of it,'' Mr. Bush said. ''His attitude is basically, cease fire and everything else happens.''

HEADLINE: Prime Office Space Still Commands Premium Prices

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
The two-story Sand Hill Commons in Menlo Park, Calif., is not the kind of structure that makes architecture buffs grab their cameras. Even the broker who recently sold it describes it as ''a little garden office building'' that a passer-by could easily miss.
 But the stucco-and-red-brick building drew plenty of attention recently when the investment firm ING Clarion bought it from a private owner for $133.5 million, or $992 a square foot, a record for a multitenant office building on the West Coast, said Gary Willard, a managing director of NAI BT Commercial, who negotiated the deal.
 The fully leased building is on Sand Hill Road, a street stretching from Menlo Park to Palo Alto that is to Silicon Valley venture capital firms what Greenwich, Conn., is to hedge funds. It had been many years since a building there had been offered for sale, Mr. Willard said. 
 From all appearances, the commercial real estate market remains very healthy. Prime office buildings in top locations are still commanding impressive prices, and not just in the hot Midtown Manhattan market. Office space is filling up, with the average vacancy rate across the country at 11.9 percent at the end of June, compared with 12.9 percent a year ago, according to CoStar Group, a commercial real estate information service in Bethesda, Md. Space is tightening in all but a few markets. ''Office is the best sector of all the property types,'' said Raymond G. Torto, the managing director of Torto Wheaton Research, a division of CB Richard Ellis, a brokerage company based in Los Angeles.
 But rising interest rates are taking their toll, some real estate specialists say. Buyers are becoming choosier and some buildings of lesser quality are staying on the market longer. Some buyers have been backing out of their sales contracts because they were unable to get financing, said Robert White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics, a research company in New York. Transactions of downtown office buildings across the country were 17 percent lower in May than they were a year ago (although suburban transactions declined by only 1 percent), his company reported.
 None of this is cause for alarm, Mr. White said. ''A little bit of the frenzy and froth has burned off, and that's probably a good thing, but nobody I've talked to is fearful that we're heading to a down cycle,'' he said. ''The market is calming down as opposed to slowing down.'' 
 He said that as buyers who relied on borrowed capital withdrew from the market, they were being replaced in part by pension funds and other institutional investors like endowment funds, which have increased their real estate holdings in recent years. 
 The total number of transactions of apartment, retail and office buildings valued at $1 million or more decreased by 5 percent for the first five months of the year, compared with the same period last year, said Hessam Nadji, managing director of research services for Marcus & Millichap, an investment brokerage company based in Encino, Calif. The decline was driven by second- and third-rate properties, he said. Sales in those categories were down by 10 percent, while sales of top-grade properties in the same three sectors rose by 7 percent, he said. 
 ''There's more discretion and more caution regarding product quality,'' he said. ''We're trying to educate our seller clients that you have to be realistic about price expectation. It's a different market.''
 Mr. Nadji said the decline in sales volume was more pronounced for the apartment and retail sectors. 
 Alan L. Pontius, director of national office and industrial sales for Marcus & Millichap, said sale prices were also dropping in some markets like Denver and South Florida. In Denver, for example, an office building recently sold for $5.8 million, about $300,000 less than the price it would have brought six months ago.
 Jeffrey A. Barclay, a managing director at ING Clarion, said that with rising interest rates, capitalization rates -- the initial return that investors are willing to accept when they buy a building -- were no longer falling. ''The effects of interest rates going up are finally beginning to be felt,'' he said. ''There is a flight to quality, as there is in most markets when interest rates rise.'' (ING Clarion, which is based in the Netherlands, was a partner in the development of the New York Times Company headquarters building on Eighth Avenue, but its interest was recently acquired by another partner, Forest City Ratner.) 
 In recent years, lower-grade office buildings in a number of cities were bought by developers who paid a premium to transform them into residential condominiums, said Craig Thomas, the director of research for Torto Wheaton. But just as apartment building conversions have slowed to a trickle, so, too, have office building conversions. ''Now you have to price these buildings at what you can generate from office occupiers,'' Mr. Thomas said. 
 As condominium development slows, office development is slowly starting to pick up, even in metropolitan areas like Atlanta, where the vacancy rate is 14.4 percent, according to CoStar Group. Nationwide, about 111.9 million square feet of space is under construction, up by 32 million square feet since the same quarter two years ago but still far below the 205.1 million square feet that were being developed in the fourth quarter of 2000, the research group said.
 Steve Sakwa, a senior real estate analyst for Merrill Lynch, said that a swelling development pipeline could harm the office market recovery. ''Will it kill the market? No, but it may take away from landlords the ability to continue to push up rents or fill their buildings,'' he said. ''We would prefer to see less supply.''
 Bret R. Wilkerson, the chief executive of Property and Portfolio Research, a Boston research company that advises institutional investors, said the actual amount of construction under way, except in Washington, was relatively modest and construction costs remained high. But he said there had been an upsurge in projects in the planning stages. 
 ''What's going on today is not yet a worry, but a couple of years down the road it could be a huge worry,'' he said. ''Overbuilding is one of those triggers that causes an ugly real estate market.''
 In the Washington metropolitan area, which has had one of the strongest office markets in the country in recent years, 134 buildings, with about 16.5 million square feet, are currently under construction, more by far than any place else, according to CoStar. ''People are getting ahead of themselves,'' Mr. Sakwa said. 
 The Lincoln Property Company of Dallas, for example, is redeveloping an office building owned by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Building Investment Trust at 15th and L Streets in downtown Washington, giving it a new glass facade and expanding it from 175,000 square feet to 325,000 square feet. But John Benziger, a senior vice president at Lincoln, said that of the 4 million square feet under development in Washington, about 40 percent had already been leased.
 But new space that is coming on the market is already having an impact in Washington. The city's office vacancy rate at the end of the second quarter was 7.1 percent, up from 6.8 percent in the first quarter, according to Cassidy & Pinkard Colliers, a Washington-area brokerage firm.
 ''In downtown Washington, we're going to have a little bit of oversupply of product in the near term, in the next 18 months,'' said William M. Collins, a managing director at Cassidy. ''That's going to push vacancies up.'' But he said the market would eventually tighten because nearly all of the development sites would be used up.

HEADLINE: Food and Fuel Send an Index 0.5% Higher

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Higher costs of food and energy pushed up wholesale prices in June to an unexpectedly high level, leaving economists to debate whether prices might be rising too quickly. 
 The Labor Department said yesterday that the Producer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in June, after a 0.2 percent increase in May. Economists had expected a rise of 0.3 percent.
Wholesale food prices increased 1.4 percent in June, propelled by higher costs for chicken, eggs and fruit. The rise in food prices alone added 0.3 point to the overall index for June. Wholesale energy prices climbed 0.7 percent. 
 Excluding food and fuel, the monthly price gain was not as strong. The so-called core index -- producer prices without those sometimes volatile components -- rose 0.2 percent in June, in line with economists' expectations, after a 0.3 percent increase in May.
 Economists differed on whether the report pointed to sustained inflation. ''The report showed more price pressures at earlier stages of production,'' a team of Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a research report yesterday. ''While not as large as May's jumps, these are still relatively big month-on-month increases, and suggest more upward pressure on core inflation later in the year.''
 But Kenneth Beauchemin, an economist with Global Insight, noting that much of the increase in June related to increases for food and energy, wrote, ''Given that these price movements are the consequence of bad luck on the supply side, and not fundamental inflationary pressures, the Fed will be satisfied with the downward move in the core rate.'' 
 Upward momentum in prices at the wholesale and retail levels has taken on added significance as investors await the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. The Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate late last month for the 17th consecutive quarter, and policy makers there say that controlling inflation is a top concern. Although some economists worry that continuing rate increases will stifle growth, the Fed has shown itself willing to keep tightening to combat inflation.
 The Fed's rate-setting committee is scheduled to meet again on Aug. 8, and many on Wall Street expect it to raise the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight bank loans to 5.5 percent, from 5.25 percent now.
 As investors mulled over the price data, corporate earnings reports and the violence in Lebanon yesterday, stocks traded in and out of positive territory all day to close slightly higher. Bond prices fell.
 An increase in wholesale prices does not necessarily mean that prices at the retail level will also rise, because companies often absorb higher costs without passing them along to the consumer. So last month's data may not foreshadow an increase in the Consumer Price Index, which is more closely watched for signs of inflation. Consumer price data for June is to be released today.
 Some economists, though, said that yesterday's report hinted at the beginning stages of higher consumer prices. The prices for intermediate goods excluding food and energy, like material used in manufacturing, have jumped 7.3 percent since last June. That suggests that in coming months, manufacturers may feel themselves under pressure to pass their higher production costs along to wholesalers, who in turn could well pass them along to retailers.
 ''Seven-point-three percent is arguably blistering,'' said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research. ''It could mean higher prices on the retail level. And the Fed doesn't want to gamble with that.''
 Intermediate goods prices, excluding food and energy, have risen in 8 of the last 12 months.

HEADLINE: The Art of Drawing, When Amateurs Roamed the Earth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
''Playing the Piano for Pleasure'' is a minor classic of self-help by Charles Cooke promoting musical amateurism, published in 1941 in the upbeat style of Dale Carnegie. It lays out a strict regime of practice and discipline, the musical equivalent to a better body in 30 days. ''We will worm our way, expending considerable effort, into the small end of the cornucopia,'' he promises, ''in order that we may later emerge, expending less effort and having the time of our life, out of the large end.''
 I was reminded of Cooke while visiting the Grolier Club, where a show called ''Teaching America to Draw'' provides a refresher course in pencil-pushing and other sorts of sketching as a collective pastime. It's about that golden era, from the time of the founding fathers nearly to Cooke's day, when educated Americans drew as a matter of course.
Drawing was a civilized thing to do, like reading and writing. It was taught in elementary schools. It was democratic. It was a boon to happiness. 
 From 1820 to 1860, more than 145,000 drawing manuals circulated, now souvenirs of our bygone cultural aspirations. Not many of these manuals are still intact because they were so heavily used, worn down like church relics, which supplicants rubbed smooth from caressing.
 We're addicted to convenience today. Cellphone cameras are handy, but they're also the equivalent of fast-food meals. Their ubiquity has multiplied our distance from drawing as a measure of self-worth and a practical tool. Before box cameras became universal a century or so ago, people drew for pleasure but also because it was the best way to preserve a cherished sight, a memory, just as people played an instrument or sang if they wanted to hear music at home because there were no record players or radios. Amateurism was a virtue, and the time and effort entailed in learning to draw, as with playing the piano, enhanced its desirability. 
 Drawing promoted meditation and stillness. ''A sustained act of will is essential to drawing,'' Paul Valery put it. ''Nothing could be more opposed to reverie, since the requisite concentration must be continually diverting the natural course of physical movements, on its guard against any seductive curve asserting itself.'' 
 A century ago it was possible for a Philadelphia educator named J. Liberty Tadd to instruct young women to stand in pigsties to learn to draw animals directly from nature. There's an illustration in the show from Tadd's ''New Methods of Education'' of a girl in a long, improbably immaculate dress sketching pigs on a blackboard. 
 The exhibition is full of such exhortatory books, many of them discomfiting today because they presume a degree of skill among ordinary citizens -- even children -- that would now be regarded as noteworthy in the art world. There are exceptions, like a popular manual from the 1840's by Benjamin Coe, one of Frederic Church's teachers, who, to judge from his illustration of a maiden in a glen, needed a little brushing-up on perspective.
 On the other hand, there's J. T. Bowen's ''United States Drawing Book,'' from 1839, with its moody view of a crumbling cathedral in a landscape, and P. Fishe Reed's ''Little Corporal's Drawing Book,'' a progressive manual from 1869 with bird drawings that Audubon might have been proud to make, conjuring an America in which 10-year-olds are absorbed not by Game Boys and iPods but by the finer points of mastering realism. 
 Clearly these manuals were aspirational no less than educational or recreational. It's hard to imagine that most American schoolchildren during the 1870's could duplicate the leaves and bugs and complicated curlicue patterns that Herman Krusi Jr. drew in his manuals for classroom instruction. But Americans wanted their children to: that's the point. 
 Something happened between then and now, and it wasn't just the invention of gadgets that eliminated the need to draw. 
 There was also a philosophical change, away from drawing as a practical endeavor and toward art appreciation. From dexterity and discipline to feelings and self-esteem: the shift in values is implied by some of the later books in the show. Consciously or not, they parallel changes in modern art, which threw out the rule books of draftsmanship and proposed a new, free-thinking attitude.
 As for expending effort to become skilled at drawing, the post-Cooke postwar generation introduced Paint by Numbers, and the situation has gone downhill from there. 
 ''Drawing in America is as much a basic human activity today as it has always been, even if it is not perceived to be as necessary to economic and cultural progress,'' Albert A. Anderson Jr. writes in the slim pamphlet accompanying the show. 
 I don't think so. Drawing and doodling are not the same. With the arts, American adults have acquiesced to playing the passive role of receivers. 
 In a new memoir, ''Let Me Finish,'' Roger Angell recalls trips to the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium in the 1930's with his father, who also liked to join pickup games when middle-age American men still did that. Today baseball is like the arts, with grown-ups mostly preferring not to break a sweat. ''We know everything about the game now, thanks to instant replay and computerized stats, and what we seem to have concluded is that almost none of us are good enough to play it,'' Mr. Angell writes.
 So it is with classical music, painting and drawing, professional renditions of which are now so widely available that most people probably can't or don't imagine there's any point in bothering to do these things themselves. Communities of amateurs still thrive, but they are self-selecting groups. A vast majority of society seems to presume that culture is something specialists produce.
 Rembrandt Peale published one of the drawing manuals in the Grolier Club show. Besides being an artist, Peale became Pennsylvania's first high school art teacher in the 1830's, hired by Alexander Dallas Bache, a grandson of Benjamin Franklin. People, Franklin pointed out, can often ''express ideas more clearly with a lead pencil or a bit of chalk'' than with words. ''Drawing is a kind of universal language, understood by all nations,'' he reminded Americans. 
 We have given it up, at a cost that, as Franklin might have put it, is beyond words. Mr. Angell goes on in his book to say that television and sports journalism have taught us all about the skills and salaries and private lives of professional ballplayers, on whom we now focus, instead of playing the game ourselves. 
 As a consequence, he writes, ''we don't like them as much as we once did, and we don't like ourselves much, either.'' 
 You can draw the analogy.

HEADLINE: Greenmarket at 30, Searching for Itself

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON; Julia Moskin contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A DOZEN precious heads of green leaf lettuce that Claudio Gonzalez had coaxed from his six acres of farmland in Orange County were wilting fast in the Harlem sun. 
 At the rate customers were ambling by his stand that recent afternoon, Mr. Gonzalez was worried. One of just three farmers who comprised the new little Greenmarket in Harlem, he might not even take in $300 for the day. And instead of Union Square's celebrity chefs and street musicians for company Mr. Gonzalez had a nutritionist and someone encouraging people to trade their food stamps for vegetables.
The market, one of 10 new theaters for local produce opened in New York this summer under the Greenmarket banner, was about as far from the experience most New Yorkers associate with a Greenmarket as a bowl of Apple Jacks is from a locally grown apple.
 From Borough Hall in the Bronx to Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, the new Greenmarkets are disappointing some shoppers and stretching thin both staff and farmers. Many of the new markets, three of which are in front of hospitals, are more about public health than perfect produce. 
 People both inside and outside the organization are wondering whether, after 30 years, the Greenmarkets are expanding too quickly. Although Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in June praised the vegetable-laden markets as a way to help combat obesity and diabetes, lovers of the Greenmarkets are debating whether they can be a premier urban outlet for heirloom tomatoes and pork fat while at the same time helping to save the city from its nutritional ills.
 ''We need to figure out just what the answer is,'' said Marcel Van Ooyen, a former environmental lawyer and City Hall veteran who in January took over as executive director of the Council on the Environment of New York City, the Greenmarkets' parent organization in the mayor's office.
 The Greenmarket system operates under the auspices of the council, which essentially adopted it when it was born 30 years ago. The name is a registered service mark, and the Greenmarkets operate on an annual budget of about $1.5 million. (More information on Greenmarkets is at cenyc.org.)
 Ten new markets in one season is a record for the organization, which now has 45 in the five boroughs. The rock star is the market at Union Square on Saturdays, when more than 70 vendors show up. Some new markets are displaying star potential, like the one on Orchard Street on the Lower East Side and the one on East 82nd Street, where the line for fruit at the Samascott Orchards stand was more than 20 people long for over an hour on opening day, July 8.
 But others appear to be duds. When the Greenmarket at 43rd Street in Clinton opened on July 1, its four vendors attracted a crowd so small that Gabrielle Langholtz, the usually enthusiastic spokeswoman for the Greenmarkets, described it as depressing.
 Priscilla O'Carrol was excited when she showed up at the new market on East 92nd Street on July 9, but was surprised at its tiny size. ''I used to live near Union Square, so I was expecting a lot more,'' she said after a tour of its three vendors.
 Mr. Van Ooyen said that this summer's Greenmarket explosion is in part a response to two trends: an increasing demand for locally grown food and an appreciation for what a farmers' market does for a neighborhood. The civic minded believe a market will improve the quality of life. Public health officials think it will promote healthier eating. Developers hope having a Greenmarket nearby will draw investors to a new project. 
 But opening a Greenmarket and getting enough traffic to support it are not easy, Ms. Langholtz said.
 ''Everyone wants a Greenmarket and they all think it's going to look like Union Square, or at least Grand Army Plaza,'' she said. ''The thing that they want is not three stands, which is sometimes all we can provide right now.''
 The Greenmarkets, although the largest urban network of farmers' markets in the country, can't meet the city's growing demand for local produce, said Linda Ameroso, an educator with the Cornell University Cooperative Extension in New York.
 As a result, dozens of other markets with ties to local farmland have opened to fill the gap. Some are small chains, like the string of Harvest Home farmers' markets, or tied to neighborhood development, like the Harlem Renaissance markets. Others are tiny efforts, like the market in the courtyard of Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in Brooklyn, which sells produce grown by patients supplemented with food from an upstate farm.
 For Ms. Ameroso and other believers in the power of local produce, the growth of the farmers' market movement is a great thing for the city. ''All of these little markets, you can't stop them,'' she said.
 In this more competitive landscape, the Greenmarkets need to find their niche. To that end, Mr. Van Ooyen is about to embark on a yearlong strategic planning process to determine the future of the Greenmarket system. One question will be how to make Greenmarkets work in what Mr. Van Ooyen calls ''food deserts'' -- parts of the city where access to fresh food is limited and nutritional needs great. 
 Trying to place Greenmarkets in neighborhoods of limited means has been part of the Greenmarket culture since the start, said Bob Lewis, who along with Barry Benepe opened the first Greenmarket on 59th Street and Second Avenue in 1976.
 ''The issues have been around for a long, long, long time,'' he said. ''What's changed is the relevance of local and organic produce. It is no longer an elitist thing.'' Mr. Lewis is now the chief marketing officer for the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.
 Finding permanent locations is the broader issue for the Greenmarkets, he said. That way, markets won't be kicked out by development or killed by waning neighborhood interest. Each year the Greenmarket closes some locations, often because they are not doing well or because they have been evicted for construction.
 ''Part of city planning's job is to locate public facilities,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''What you have now is a new relevance of the market and a need for security of sites.''
 To try to connect poor people with local farmers, Mr. Van Ooyen persuaded the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, to spend $81,000 to help more people use electronic benefit transfer, or E.B.T., cards -- the electronic version of food stamps -- at Greenmarkets. Food stamps can be used at eight markets, and some individual farmers at other markets also accept them.
 Farmers' markets nationwide have been struggling to find a way to outfit farmers with hand-held terminals since many states, including New York, began replacing paper coupons with debit cards in the late 1990's.
 The Greenmarket is experimenting with two methods. One provides farmers with wireless terminals at their stands. The other lets people exchange a swipe of the card at a central terminal for wooden tokens, which the farmer can then collect.
 Both methods have their problems. The individual terminals are expensive and technologically challenging, especially in bad weather. The $1 wooden tokens are an unusual way to shop; the tokens are good only at the market where they're purchased and can't be returned if they're not used.
 But making Greenmarkets work in some neighborhoods takes more than a food stamp program.
 ''We talk about food access and food security and the need, but there's not always an existing demand,'' Ms. Langholtz said. ''Maybe their grandparents cooked collards, but they don't.''
 Interest in Greenmarket produce is better in economically mixed neighborhoods, where residents have recently immigrated to the United States and are from more rural areas. 
 Then there is the sometimes delicate task of convincing producers and farmers that a market in an unproven location will be worth their time. 
 ''Everybody wants to be at Union Square, but we were told the waiting list was five years,'' said Charlie Burd, who was having a good day selling cheese for Consider Bardwell Farm in Vermont at the new Greenmarket near City Hall on opening day, July 7. Ms. Langholtz said no such list exists, but agrees that there are very few slots for new purveyors at Union Square. If Union Square is already inundated with purveyors of goat cheese, for example, a new goat cheese vendor will be asked to try another location.
 Even so, $20-a-pound raw milk cheese might not sell so well at the Harlem market.
 ''Matching the farmer and the market is part art and part science,'' Ms. Langholtz said. The Greenmarkets won't send pork producers to Borough Park in Brooklyn, for instance, or expensive maple syrup vendors to Washington Heights. But expensive honey is selling well at the Inwood market, she said.
 The mix of farmers in the Greenmarkets is constantly changing. In the past five years, 62 farmers have left the system. One is David Haughton, who grew up farming in Jamaica and now grows stone fruit along with cucumbers, peppers and squash on 30 acres near New Paltz, N.Y. He spent four years in the Greenmarket system before leaving in 2001. This year he joined with a few other African-American farmers and opened a market in the northeast Bronx.
 He prefers to run his stand without the restrictions imposed by the Greenmarket, which requires that farmers sell only their own products or those from neighboring farms and that their farms pass inspections.
 ''Maybe I'm not the type of person who could live up to their rules,'' he said. ''Where I am, I can just do with what I have and survive.''
 To find new farmers, the Greenmarket grows its own with an incubator program that helps people who have some agricultural experience work their own land. Mr. Gonzalez, who is selling at the Harlem market and in Bedford-Stuyvesant, is a graduate of the program.
 Although business is picking up, his first outing in Brooklyn put less than $150 in his pocket, barely enough to cover what it cost to get into town from Middletown. 
 ''The people there maybe don't have the money to spend with me,'' he said of the Bedford-Stuyvesant market. And he's trying to figure out what sells in Harlem. He ended up having to toss out his lettuce and cilantro on opening day, July 6, but he sold out of green tomatoes.
 Even when a Greenmarket lands in a neighborhood, not everyone is charmed by produce grown no more than a half-day's drive away.
 ''The prices are so much better from the pushcarts,'' said Sylvia Egelberg, who lives near the 92nd Street market. ''Why should I care where the stuff is grown? I care if it looks good and if it tastes good.''
 Ms. Langholtz, in pitching the potential of the new Greenmarkets, likes to use the ''Rome wasn't built in a day'' argument. Some of the younger Greenmarkets in neighborhoods like Inwood and Fort Greene, Brooklyn, have only a dozen or so stands, but are beloved and serve as community gathering places in a way the crowded Union Square market can't.
 Besides, one never knows when one of the scruffy new Greenmarkets might become the new crown jewel. 
 In a 1978 article in The New Yorker called ''Giving Good Weight,'' John McPhee described his experience working at Greenmarkets in Harlem and Brooklyn, at the time two vibrant outposts. In those days, no one wanted to go to Union Square. The area was so rough, Mr. McPhee wrote, that farmers took along iron pipes for protection.

HEADLINE: Study Finds the Potential Choke Points of Atlantic Yards 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
A new school's worth of classrooms would be needed to handle all the children. Dozens of crowded intersections would be choked with more traffic. Brownstone neighborhoods would find themselves in shadow. The city's sewer and water systems would face new challenges. And good luck getting a parking space on game day.
 These were among the most striking findings of a 1,400-page study released yesterday, for the first time laying out all the potential effects of the proposed Atlantic Yards project, an 8.7-million-square-foot residential, commercial, and arena development that would spread over 22 acres near Downtown Brooklyn.
 The study, released by the Empire State Development Corporation, was accompanied by a project plan that estimated the cost of the development at $4.2 billion, much more than the original cost, $2.5 billion. 
 Residents have known for more than two years that something big may be coming to the corner of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues, something that would affect their lives and neighborhoods in countless ways. But until yesterday, they did not have a picture of the details.
 The draft environmental impact study provides the clearest view yet of what the Atlantic Yards would do for Brooklyn, and to it, with a welter of diagrams and cold hard facts.
 Some of them are sure to be controversial. According to the study, the project would worsen what is already a tangled web of traffic. When it is fully built a decade from now, 68 of 93 intersections included in the study, all within about a mile of the project, would have significantly more congestion at one or more peak hours, most markedly during the morning rush hours and after Saturday games at the 18,000-seat basketball arena for the Nets.
 The tallest of the project's 16 buildings would block many views of the Williamsburgh Savings Bank. The new buildings would also throw more of the surrounding neighborhoods into shadow during the day, while street-level signs would create a new burst of neon at night, concentrated at the commercial corridors on the project's western tip. 
 The project's thousands of residents would impose new demands on the city's sewage and storm drain systems, and include enough children to fill a new elementary and intermediate school. 
 Changes to the project and the city infrastructure supporting it may eliminate or minimize some of the predicted problems, the project's backers have promised. In exchange, they say, Atlantic Yards would create 6,860 units of housing, thousands of construction jobs, and nearly $1.5 billion in city and state tax revenue beyond the amount needed to recoup the government's contribution to the project. 
 ''It's a project of enormous magnitude, something that certainly will be important for the future and the economy of the city and state,'' said Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the development corporation, which is sponsoring the project.
 The project's developer, Forest City Ratner Companies, is the development partner of The New York Times Company in building its new headquarters on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. The study was commissioned by the development corporation and paid for by Forest City Ratner, as required by law. 
 The study found that if all the project's children attended a primary or intermediate school within half a mile of their new home, the existing schools would be ''over capacity,'' and new satellite classrooms in less crowded schools, new school buildings or other measures would be needed.
 In a detailed examination of the shadows cast by the new buildings in each season, the report found that new shadows would fall on many existing parks, as well as on open space incorporated into the new project, ''throughout the year,'' but with a ''significant adverse impact'' for only one such area, near the Atlantic Terminal public housing complex.
 The study also included extensive mitigation measures that the developer said would alleviate most of the project's negative impacts. An ecologically friendly storm-water capture system centered on the arena's roof, for instance, is expected to help prevent sewage overflows. 
 The report's release sets into motion a public comment period. The project faces a final vote by the development corporation's board this fall, and if it is approved, it will face a vote by the state Public Authorities Control Board.
 Critics of Atlantic Yards have questioned whether the scope of the impact study was comprehensive enough, and may choose to fight the project in court on those grounds. .
 Opponents have already promised a vigorous legal struggle against the development corporation's efforts to condemn the small amount of property that Forest City Ratner has not been able to acquire privately. Those efforts, in effect, began yesterday with the corporation's formal declaration that the blocks on which the project would be built meet the state's definition of ''blighted,'' and thus qualify for eminent domain.
 Critics of the project complained yesterday that the 60-day public-comment period was too short to allow residents enough time to wade through the environmental study. Others questioned why it had been released in the middle of the summer, when the borough's community boards are in recess.
 ''The E.S.D.C. is making a mockery of what has already been a completely flawed process,'' said Daniel Goldstein, the spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, an umbrella group for opponents of the project.
 At a press conference yesterday, Mr. Gargano, the development corporation's chairman, tried to deflect criticism of the project's scale, one of the main issues cited by Brooklyn residents. When asked whether he thought the project could be made smaller, he replied, ''I don't think it can be.'' Later, however, he gave a slightly different answer, saying that though the developer would prefer to keep the project at 8.7 million square feet, the development corporation would contemplate reductions during the public comment period.
 James P. Stuckey, the Forest City executive in charge of Atlantic Yards, said criticism of the project's scale and other attributes came from ''some people, who live close in, not liking tall buildings.''
 ''And I have to tell you that for most people who need affordable housing, that's just not an argument that washes,'' he said.
 Those who oppose the project said that the documents released by the development corporation gave them yet more ammunition. According to the general project plan for Atlantic Yards, the project's cost, which was originally estimated at $2.5 billion and was reassessed at $3.5 billion last year, is now $4.2 billion, which Mr. Goldstein called ''bloated.''
 Mr. Stuckey said the increases stemmed from rising construction costs, higher land acquisition costs, and a more detailed accounting of costs than was possible at earlier stages in the project's development.
 The general project plan also projects that Atlantic Yards will generate a total of $1.91 billion in total tax revenue over 30 years, calculated as net present value. The city and state together would contribute about $500 million to the project, a mix of direct payments, tax exemptions and financing costs. Overall, according to those projections, the development as currently proposed would produce about $1.4 billion in net tax revenues to the city and state, slightly less than a previous estimate used by Forest City Ratner, and less than projected when the development was originally announced. 
 Mr. Stuckey said the Empire State Development Corporation study had used a different methodology. ''Their calculation tends to be a more conservative calculation,'' he said. ''But what their own numbers are saying is, even after you look at the contribution that the government will make, the government will earn $1.4 billion in excess tax revenues as a result of this project.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about a study detailing the potential environmental effects of the proposed Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn referred incorrectly in some copies to a $1.4 billion estimate of the net tax revenues that the project would bring to the city and state. That estimate is higher -- not lower -- than the original estimate of $813 million, which corresponded to a smaller version of the project. Maps showing expected traffic congestion in the neighborhoods around the project's site incorrectly rendered its boundaries. Corrected versions are at nytimes.com/region.

HEADLINE: Arlington Park Seeks Reasons for Its High Injury Rate

BYLINE: By BILL FINLEY

 BODY:
Ordinarily, when a horse like Easy Strider breaks down on the racetrack and has to be euthanized, little fuss is made.
 Easy Strider, who was euthanized after fracturing his right rear tibia during the first race Saturday at Arlington Park, was no Barbaro. He was a modestly bred 2-year-old colt who was not projected to have great ability or value.
 From an economic standpoint, it made little sense to spend thousands of dollars to support his faint hopes of survival. 
 Horses have to be euthanized sometimes, and most people around a racetrack consider it part of the game and try to move on. But at Arlington Park, just outside Chicago, that has not been the case. 
 An alarming number of breakdowns at the current meet has horsemen asking questions, and track and state officials trying to figure out if the injuries are a coincidence, or the byproduct of a dangerous racing surface.
 ''After something like this happens, you've got to wonder what is going on,'' said Brian Williamson, Easy Strider's trainer. ''This horse was never sore or anything like that.'' 
 Easy Strider was the 17th horse euthanized after an on-track accident this year at Arlington, which has been open for its current meet since May 5.
 About one of every 200 starters at Arlington has had to be put down; the industry as a whole averages about one fatal breakdown per 1,000 starters. At Pimlico, where Barbaro was injured during the Preakness, only one horse had to be euthanized during the 31-day spring meet.
 Arlington officials have been quick to address fears that there was something wrong with the track's racing surface. Since the outbreak of the breakdowns, the track has been modified and inspected. 
 Pine bark shavings were added to the surface to make the track more forgiving when struck by a horse's hooves. The Illinois Racing Board conducted an investigation and, after consulting with an outside firm brought in to inspect the surface, came to the conclusion that the track was safe. 
 ''I wouldn't know what to tell management to do with the track,'' said jockey Chris Emigh, who was aboard Easy Strider and is the leading rider at Arlington with 65 winners. ''The track seems to be in good shape, and I think all the jockeys feel that way. I have no idea why so many horses have been breaking down. I wish I had an answer.''
 The racing board's findings might have answered questions about the track surface, but they did not settle the question of why so many horses had broken down. It could simply be a statistical aberration. 
 ''Sometimes, things just happen in freakish ways,'' jockey Randy Meier said. ''If the jockeys didn't believe the track was safe, we wouldn't be out there riding every day.''
 Christine Janks, a trainer on the Chicago circuit who has not had a horse break down at the meet, said her fellow trainers might be running horses who are unfit to race.
 ''The Illinois Racing Board, at my suggestion, is now investigating the vet records on the horses that broke down,'' Janks said.
 Raising the possibility that some horses had detectable physical problems, she added, ''It's ludicrous to just look at the track and not look at who's putting the horses out there.''
 Mickey Ezzo, a spokesman for the Illinois Racing Board, said an additional state veterinarian would soon be hired so that horses running at Arlington could be given more thorough examinations before racing.
 ''We need to do a better job of examining these horses,'' Ezzo said.
 Fourteen of the 17 horses that broke down were claimers, which are often less talented horses with limited value. They are sometimes kept in training despite having injuries. Easy Strider, however, was making his career debut in a maiden special-weight race.
 ''All horses have problems,'' said the trainer Tom Tomillo, whose 9-year-old claimer Point of America was euthanized after breaking his right front ankle in a $5,000 claiming race on June 22. ''Most just run with them. With that horse, there weren't any serious problems. He was pretty sound.''
 Before Saturday, when Easy Strider broke down, Arlington had gone through nine straight days of racing without a horse having to be euthanized. Sunday was another problem-free day. After a two-day break, Arlington resumes racing today.
 ''Whatever was going on, I think they have it under control,'' Tomillo said.

HEADLINE: Study Documents 'Ghetto Tax' Being Paid by the Urban Poor

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18 

 BODY:
Drivers from low-income neighborhoods of New York, Hartford and Baltimore, insuring identical cars and with the same driving records as those from middle-class neighborhoods, paid $400 more on average for a year's insurance.
 The poor are also the main customers for appliances and furniture at ''rent to own'' stores, where payments are stretched out at very high interest rates; in Wisconsin, a $200 television can end up costing $700.
Those were just two examples among several cited in a report Tuesday showing that poor urban residents frequently pay hundreds if not thousands of dollars a year in extra costs for everyday necessities. The study said some of the disparities were due to real differences in the cost of doing business in poor areas, some to predatory financial practices and some to consumer ignorance. 
 The study, from the Brookings Institution, said finding ways to eliminate these added costs, often called a ''ghetto tax,'' could be an important new front in the fight against poverty. 
 At a meeting connected with the report's release, officials from three states -- New York, Pennsylvania and Washington -- said they were already doing just that through a variety of programs to draw banks to poor neighborhoods, help finance the construction of supermarkets and encourage innovative insurance schemes. 
 ''There's a large and for the most part overlooked opportunity here to help low-income families get ahead,'' Matt Fellowes, the Brookings researcher who wrote the report, said in an interview. ''That is to reduce their costs.'' 
 Measures that reduced the price of essential goods and services for low-income Americans by just 1 percent would put an additional $6.5 billion a year in their hands, said the report, titled ''From Poverty, Opportunity.''
 Sheldon H. Danziger, a poverty expert at the University of Michigan, noted that $6.5 billion was roughly one-third the benefit the same families have gained through the earned-income tax credit. ''Certainly these measures could be an important source of income,'' Professor Danziger said of the report's findings. ''But I don't see them as competing with things like raising the minimum wage, raising child subsidies and providing health insurance.'' 
 Citing other examples of the ghetto tax, the report found that nationally, 4.5 million low-income customers, defined as families making less than $30,000 a year, paid an average of two percentage points more for car loans than did middle-class buyers. And the common use of storefront check-cashing services by poor people, it said, comes at a steep price that varies with local regulations; in 12 cities studied, the fee for cashing a $500 check ranged from $5 to $50. 
 Part of the problem, the study found, is a discrepancy between the poor and the middle class in consumer skills and mobility: people who comparison-shop, especially on the Internet, tend to pay hundreds less for the identical car than those who walk onto a city lot and buy.
 But the disparities can be reduced, the report said, not only by consumer education but also by some combination of incentives to lure banks and stores into poor neighborhoods and tighter regulation on things like the fees of storefront lenders.
 The New York State Banking Department has drawn major banks into underserved neighborhoods by placing deposits of government money, sometimes at below-market interest, in the new branches. These may enable more residents to open accounts and reduce reliance on costly check-cashers and lenders, said the state's superintendent of banks, Diana L. Taylor. 
 In Pennsylvania, a program led by a Democratic state legislator, Dwight Evans, used state and private financing for construction of supermarkets in areas where residents had previously had to rely on costly small stores or drive long distances for groceries. 
 Washington State's insurance commissioner, Mike Kreidler, described efforts to restrict the use of personal credit scores by sellers of home and car insurance. 
 In a practice that has recently come into wide use in the industry, insurers study credit history to help judge the likelihood that a customer will file insurance claims; those with worse credit records are charged higher premiums, because, insurers say, the industry has found a correlation between poor ratings and the filing of claims.
 But Mr. Kreidler and some consumer groups say that the insurers' approach is not transparent and consistent and that their method is likely to increase prices unfairly for poor people and minorities.
 The insurance industry, on the other hand, argues that the new approach benefits many low-income consumers. ''We think the use of credit scoring has allowed us to better serve urban areas,'' David F. Snyder, vice president of the American Insurance Association, said in an interview. Mr. Snyder said that with this more individualized tool, companies were less likely to raise rates for entire neighborhoods or categories.

HEADLINE: A Chance to Reform the Corps

 BODY:
The Senate has a rare opportunity today to strike a blow for both fiscal sanity and environmental stewardship. It will consider several amendments that would bring a measure of discipline and independent oversight to the Army Corps of Engineers, a notoriously spendthrift agency with a history of answering to no one except a few members of Congress who control its purse strings. 
 The reputation of the Corps is now at a low ebb because of levee failures in New Orleans. But well before that debacle, studies by the National Academy of Sciences and others had found that the agency routinely inflated the economic payoffs of its construction projects to justify steadily greater budget outlays, while underestimating the environmental damage of those projects.
The amendments' main sponsors are the Senate's reformist duo of John McCain and Russ Feingold. One amendment would subject any project costing more than $40 million to an independent review of the project's design, feasibility, cost and environmental consequences. A second amendment would require that projects be ranked in order of importance based on established national priorities like flood control and environmental restoration. This amendment is aimed less at the Corps than its Congressional paymasters, who have historically put their own local pork barrel projects ahead of more urgent and generally accepted needs. 
 The sponsors will try to attach these amendments to the five-year $40 billion Water Resources Development bill, itself overdue even though it includes several important provisions. One authorizes $1.5 billion for key elements of the Everglades restoration project, which has suffered from Congressional neglect. Another would jump-start a major effort to reverse the erosion of coastal wetlands that has left Louisiana vulnerable to flooding.
 A bill this size inevitably has the usual ration of local pork. But some of this would now be subject to outside review and possible rejection if the McCain-Feingold amendments stick. As they should. These reforms made sense when first offered in 2002. Post-Katrina, they are essential.

HEADLINE: 100 Years Later, Making the Best of an American Tragedy

BYLINE: By ELEANOR RANDOLPH

DATELINE: BIG MOOSE LAKE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The last thing this community needs after the brutal murder of Grace Brown is closure. Pregnant and unmarried, Miss Brown was killed here 100 years ago this month. The 20-year-old factory worker was drowned somehow on a boat trip with Chester Gillette, her handsome but ambitious lover. And Mr. Gillette was executed for her death two years later in the electric chair at Auburn State Prison.
 The story of Grace and Chester is not a particularly cheery tale. But given the rough economic seasons suffered recently in the Adirondacks, the recounting of their deaths -- later recast in Theodore Dreiser's long, dark novel ''An American Tragedy'' -- is just the draw for tourists and their carefully hoarded dollars. 
 So this summer there has been a staging of the murder and a new plaque in honor of Miss Brown. The local post office provided stamp cancellations to commemorate the actual event, which happened on July 11, 1906, and Dunn's marina has been running boats to take the mildly curious and the recreationally obsessed to the site of Miss Brown's death. 
 There are readings of Grace's plaintive letters to Chester. ''I miss you and want to see you, but I wish I could die,'' she wrote shortly before that girlish wish was tragically fulfilled. There are trial re-enactments, including one in the original courthouse in Herkimer. (Missing will be the clatter of New York City's yellow journalists who staged a mock lynch mob at the jail where Chester was being held, then wrote about it to boost the coverage on a slow day.) And the commemorations will undoubtedly go on until March 30, 2008, the 100-year anniversary of Mr. Gillette's execution at age 24. 
 What keeps people coming back to this particular murder and this particular place? ''Nobody really knows what happened out there on the lake but the two of them,'' explained Craig Brandon, an author and expert on the real murder. That leaves a central mystery that can be unraveled in a variety of ways.
 Mr. Dreiser turned Chester into something close to an accidental villain with a full agony of human frailties. Dreiser's Clyde Griffiths plans to murder Roberta Alden but then decides, no, then accidentally knocks her out of the boat. Two movies have taken on the story, one so infuriating to Grace's mother that the family sued and won a modest settlement.
 The real jury dismissed the possibilities that Grace, who told everyone she couldn't swim, had fallen or jumped from the little boat. ''They weren't sure exactly what Chester was guilty of, but they knew he'd done something bad,'' offered Joseph Brownell, another author and expert on the story.
 Grace's letters do talk constantly of ''how I want to die,'' so one theory has a double-suicide pact that Chester decided not to honor. Perhaps he really did strike her with a tennis racket, as the prosecutor charged. Or maybe he merely shoved a 98-pound girl whose skirts might have dragged even an expert swimmer underwater.
 ''It would have been harder for him to strike her, I think, than to just push her over,'' surmised Robert Williams of Atlanta, Mich. 
 Mr. Williams has a special status on Big Moose Lake because Grace Brown was his great-aunt (his grandmother's sister). Shortly before a memorial wreath was cast into the lake at the approximate time of Grace's death, Mr. Williams and his sister displayed a few of the family mementos. There on a lakeside table at the Big Moose Inn were Grace's palm-sized leather diary, a pattern book from the factory where she and Chester worked, and a curl of her thin, brown hair retrieved by the family after her death.
 Like others directly related to Chester and Grace, Mr. Williams and his family did not talk about the murder as he was growing up. He said he first learned the truth when his father saw him reading the Dreiser novel for college and revealed the family connection.
 Now, of course, every detail of the murder, trial and execution is a subject of discussion and gentle debate. And instead of titillation over someone else's misery, the Grace and Chester matter now offers something this area really needs: a satisfying, even edifying attraction at the height of the summer tourist season.

HEADLINE: Dodging Traffic and Pitfalls in Gourmet GeorgiaFrugal Traveler

BYLINE: By MATT GROSS

 BODY:
Georgians are the worst drivers in the world. I say this after having dodged Hondas in Hanoi, angry Argentine drivers in Buenos Aires and out-of-control buses in Albania. But a Georgian taxi driver will reverse his cracked-windshield Lada up a highway off-ramp, simultaneously fiddling with the broken tape deck and text-messaging his mistress. So what if he hits a pedestrian along the way thats assuming, of course, that he even knows where hes taking you.
 Still, this is progress. It was not long ago that this former Soviet republic was embroiled in civil war, crime and corruption. But nowadays, thanks in part to the so-called Rose Revolution of 2003, which led to widespread reforms, travelers like me can fly from Istanbul to Tbilisi, Georgias cosmopolitan capital ($450 round trip on Turkish Airlines), without worrying about safety.
 I came here to enjoy cheap but yummy food and wine, intellectual cafe society and sunny hospitality. Thanks to readers comments, I found what I was seeking almost immediately. I checked into the Hotel Charm (11 Chakhrukhadze Street, 995-32-985-333; www.hotelcharm.ge) an old house run by the friendly Ninidze family. My top-floor room, with sloping wooden ceilings and antique furniture, was $40 a night. 
 I had my first Georgian meal at Maidan (2 Mtkvari Right Bank, 995-32-751-188), a subterranean restaurant in Tbilisis atmospheric Old Town with arched, vaulted brick ceilings and comfortable pillows. The chakhapuli (goat stew with tarragon and sour plums) was fabulous. Along with a good glass of Teliani Valley wine, it cost 40 lari, or about $19 at 2.19 lari to the dollar. I was shocked to spend so much, but it would be the most I dropped on any meal all week.
 My postprandial stroll took me down Sharden Street, lined with inviting cafes and galleries. I stopped into the Nini K. boutique (www.ninikny.com) to admire the quirky knit hats that sell for 150 to 300 lari in Tbilisi. Nini K. herself was there. Shes a svelte, stylish Georgian who spends most of the year in Manhattan where her hats are carried by Bergdorf Goodman. We struck up an easy conversation about our favorite downtown bars. Before long, she invited me to a party at her country house no one stays in Tbilisi during the summer, she said. Well! Here was the Georgian hospitality Id heard so much about.
 The next evening, she drove me out to Tzerovani, a hillside village about 30 minutes from Tbilisi. I met her friends, all of whom spoke excellent English and had spent years, if not decades, in New York City. As we emptied bottles of whiskey, vodka and wine (Id splurged on a gorgeous 48-lari saperavi) and danced to the Clash and Black-Eyed Peas, the evening began to feel unsettlingly familiar. Was this Georgia or Chelsea?
 Outside the hillside house, however, there was a Georgia I could only follow in English-language newspapers. Two regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, were fighting for independence. A murder trial that implicated high-level officials in the death of an opposition politician had just ended with a verdict that hinted at government interference. Unemployment was rife, and crime and inflation were on the rise. The Rose Revolution, it seemed, had yet to bloom.
 As a tourist, however, I saw none of this. My Tbilisi was a city of cafes and Old Town architecture (endless arches and sagging balconies), where even the Soviet-era concrete blocks evoked a certain joie de vivre. And if their food was any clue, Tbilisians certainly enjoyed life. The cuisine was a rainbow of herbs and meats, with crushed walnuts thrown into just about everything. After a glass or three of luscious wine (dont believe the myth that its insufferably sweet), Tbilisi felt like a forgotten European capital, only cheaper and with people who were genuinely excited to show me their country.
 Again and again, I found myself invited to participate in workaday routines that would be unthinkable in Paris or Vienna. One afternoon, I joined a group of students as they watched Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, then fielded questions about American pop cultural ephemera like Doogie Howser, MD. At the state history museum, I asked a French-speaking docent if I could help the museum director with his archeological dig at Dmanisi, where hed discovered the oldest human remains outside Africa. Sure, he said, the dig would start in a week.
 And one Friday evening, as I took photographs of diners and drinkers along the trendy Erekle II Street, a young woman, whose name was also Nini, invited me to join her 18th birthday celebration. She offered me a shot of vodka and peppered me with questions: Why had I come to Georgia? Did I like Georgia? What did I think of Georgian women?
 Next thing I knew, we were at Night Office, a club inside the right-bank anchorage of the Baratashvili Bridge. As we danced to progressive house, my right knee twinged with every awkward move, and I began to feel as old as Tbilisi itself. Luckily, these teenagers had curfews and by 1:30 a.m., the night was over.
 The next morning, it was time to make like a Tbilisian and escape the citys summer heat. Accompanied by Amanda and Jay, a pair of Peace Corps volunteers Id befriended over breakfast at the Hotel Charm, I set out for Kazbegi in northern Georgia, where the 14th-century Tsminda Sameba monastery stands atop a 7,119-foot peak a national symbol of independence and determination. As usual, the journey was cheap but slow: a 6-lari taxi to the Didube bus station, followed by a 3.50-lari ride in a marshrutka, or minibus, that was so crowded I had to sit on a wooden stool for most of the four-hour trip.
 But even from my thrombosis-inducing seat, I could see the mountains. Imposing and steep, the Great Caucasus Mountains are carpeted with pea-green grass on which herds of sure-footed cattle graze, interrupted by crisp, rushing streams. I began to understand why, as one reader wrote me, the army of the largest country in the world has been unable to tame an area smaller than Long Island.
 Gazing at them from the minibus was one thing; climbing them unprepared and out of shape is another. Despite the supposed presence of two well-marked trails, we opted to create our own shortcut, and soon found ourselves ascending the crumbly soil of a 65-degree cliff, cursing and sweating and straining. A single misstep onto loose slate, we knew, could plunge us to our deaths. Had we survived the hazardous traffic of Tbilisi only to be undone by a mountain climb?
 But like Georgia itself over the last 15 years, a little persistence goes a long way. We kept ourselves low to the ground and made each step with care, and soon the monastery came into view, crowded with people who had followed the easy, obvious paths. We collapsed exhausted on the grass and spent the day watching bearded men parade about with swords in their belts, children ride horses bareback and the faithful sing otherworldly hymns. I felt more alive than I had in years, and as we devoured our well-earned picnic of bread, cheese, sausage and pickles, I wondered: Do we really have to come back down to earth?
 Next stops: Kyrgyzstan and Urumqi, China.

HEADLINE: Late Surge Helps Market Stop 4-Day Slide

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A late rally in stocks ended a four-day losing streak yesterday as oil prices dropped, Coca-Cola's profit surpassed estimates and United Technologies raised its full-year earnings forecast.
 Stocks bounced back from losses that followed a cut in the Target Corporation's sales projection and a government report on producer prices that suggested the Federal Reserve might keep raising interest rates.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.37 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,236.86. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 51.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,799.23, led by Coca-Cola and United Technologies. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 5.50 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,043.22. 
 Investors are focusing on earnings growth to gauge whether the Federal Reserve's two-year campaign of increased borrowing costs is curtailing corporate profits. They are also awaiting today's consumer price data and Congressional testimony by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to determine the direction of inflation, monetary policy and the rest of the economy.
 Oil fell for a second day on speculation that shipments will not be disrupted by the fighting in the Middle East. Crude oil for August delivery fell 2.3 percent, to $73.54 a barrel, in New York. It touched a record $78.40 on Friday, the highest, not adjusted for inflation, since trading began in 1983.
 Coca-Cola, the world's biggest soft drink maker, reported a larger-than-expected increase in second-quarter profit, signaling it is continuing to win customers as consumer spending slows. Coca-Cola added 85 cents, to $43.55.
 United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters, lifted its profit forecast as sales rose at all six of its main businesses. The company said it might earn up to $3.65 a share this year, 5 cents more than the high end of its earlier forecast. Its shares advanced 92 cents, to $58.88.
 Retail shares led the market's decline earlier in the day after Target lowered its forecast for July same-store sales to a gain of 3 percent to 4 percent as higher oil prices curtail consumer spending. It earlier forecast an increase of 4 percent to 6 percent. Target dropped $2.02, to $45.53.
 About seven stocks rose for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 1.71 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.
 The government reported that prices paid to United States producers climbed at a faster rate in June, led by higher costs for food and raw materials. Wholesale prices gained 0.5 percent, the Labor Department said yesterday. The rate rose 0.2 percent in May.
 Bond yields rose for the first time in almost two weeks as the producer-prices report spurred traders to increase bets that the Fed would lift its pivotal interest rate for an 18th consecutive time next month.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 0.07 percentage point, to 5.13 percent. The price fell 17/32, to 9930/32.
 Centene plunged $7.44 to $13.60. The company, involved in health care management, said it would earn 95 cents to $1.04 a share this year, less than its previous forecast of at least $1.53, because of rising medical costs in Indiana and Texas.
 Nortel Networks, North America's largest maker of telephone equipment, had its biggest gain in four months after it and Microsoft agreed to jointly develop software for Web-based telephones. Nortel rose 12 cents, to $2.08, while Microsoft gained 26 cents, to $22.74.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills.

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price -- 99.622

HEADLINE: Zero to 60 in 4 Seconds, Totally From Revving Batteries

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18 

 BODY:
In a new approach to making the electric car a mass-market product, a California company will unveil on Wednesday a model that is very specialized, very expensive and very, very fast.
 Tesla Motors, a four-year-old Silicon Valley start-up, has raised $60 million and spent about $25 million developing a two-seat Roadster that will sell for $85,000 to $100,000.
It goes from zero to 60 miles an hour in four seconds, ''wicked fast,'' said the company's chairman, Martin Eberhard. Because it is an electric, the driver does not have to shift into second gear until the car hits 65, he said. 
 The Roadster comes 10 years after the introduction of another two-seat electric car that was hailed as a breakthrough in technology, the EV-1 made by General Motors. While many environmentalists had hoped that would be the vanguard of a new trend, G.M. withdrew that car as the three-year leases expired, saying that its limited range -- less than 100 miles -- made it unmarketable. 
 The recent movie ''Who Killed the Electric Car?'' argues that G.M. and California conspired to kill a vehicle that would have been popular. The EV-1 was leased on a basis comparable to a vehicle in the mid-$30,000 range.
 In contrast to the EV-1, the Roadster is supposed to go about 250 miles on a single charge. It uses lithium-ion batteries, the kind most commonly found in laptops, and carries about three times the energy the EV-1 did, although the battery pack weighs only about 900 pounds; the original EV-1 battery pack weighed more than 1,100 pounds.
 And where the EV-1 had 26 batteries wired together, the Roadster has 6,831, arranged in what Mr. Eberhard called a complex network. The voltage of the batteries is added together, as if they were wired serially, like flashlight batteries. If one fails, only the computer running the car will notice, he said, and the effect on total energy storage would be like ''dropping a couple of marbles in the gas tank of your car.'' 
 The car comes with a kit that connects to a 240-volt circuit and charges the batteries from dead to fully charged in three and a half hours. It can also be charged on a normal 110-volt household outlet, but that takes longer. 
 At the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that is not normally a fan of fast cars, Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of the energy program, called the roadster ''a remarkable potential breakthrough'' because it does not use oil and can be powered by clean sources of electricity.
 The last round of electric vehicles was built in anticipation of a ''zero emission vehicle'' quota to be imposed by California, but the state dropped the mandate. 
 The Roadster's advantage is that it avoids gasoline at $3 a gallon. At the national average retail price for electricity and fuel economy of 200 watt-hours per mile, it will go 150 miles on the price of a gallon of unleaded regular. 
 Still, saving money presumably won't be the prime motivation of most potential buyers, since to earn back the $65,000 premium over a two-seater like, say, the Mazda Miata, would require more than 700,000 miles of driving. 
 According to Mr. Eberhard, the way to get a new product into the mass market is to sell it to rich people. 
 ''Cellphones, refrigerators, color TV's, they didn't start off by making a low-end product for masses,'' he said. ''They were relatively expensive, for people who could afford it.'' The companies that sold those products at first, he said, did so ''not because they were stupid and they thought the real market was at the high end of the market,'' but because that was how to get production started. His company and others that have tried electric cars, he said, are too small to produce by the tens of thousands anyway.
 The company will start taking orders on Wednesday and hopes to begin deliveries in the middle of next year, he said. It hopes to sell 4,000 to 5,000 over three years and then move on to a larger, more mainstream vehicle.

HEADLINE: Democrats in Connecticut Governor's Race Meet in Debate 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., July 18 

 BODY:
Overshadowed for weeks by a fierce United States Senate primary that is drawing national attention, the two Democratic candidates for governor, Dannel P. Malloy and John DeStefano Jr., tried to differentiate themselves for primary voters at a debate Tuesday night. 
 Mr. DeStefano, the mayor of New Haven, said he was running for governor to ''get things done for working people.''
''For the last two years, Connecticut has been hobbled by a governor with no vision and no ability to get things done,'' Mr. DeStefano said, referring to the Republican incumbent, M. Jodi Rell. ''And I'm motivated by a set of values that say that people who work hard ought to be able to do better for themselves and their kids, and the government has a responsibility to see that that happens.''
 He outlined his plans to create 20,000 jobs, reform property taxes, and provide universal health care to cover the uninsured and reduce costs for everyone. He said he would pay for his health care plan by eliminating corporate loopholes.
 Mr. Malloy, the mayor of Stamford, also said the state needed new leadership and a health care plan that covered the uninsured.
 Like Mr. DeStefano, Mr. Malloy pointed to his record as mayor, saying he helped bring 5,000 jobs, more moderate-income housing, a universal prekindergarten program and a lower crime rate to Stamford.
 ''It's the sort of record that you want to have in a governor,'' Mr. Malloy said. ''We're going to confront problems. We're going to get the job done.
 ''We're going to turn this state around and address transportation,'' he continued. ''We're certainly going to make sure that every citizen of this state has access to health care with my program.'' 
 The debate, sponsored by The Day of New London and the League of Women Voters, was held at the Garde Arts Center and broadcast live on television. The two candidates clashed on campaign finance reform and their health care plans, but agreed on the issue of eminent domain.
 New London has been ground zero in a national debate on the public seizure of property. Last year, the United States Supreme Court upheld the city's right to take homes in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood for an economic development project after homeowners challenged the plan.
 But the court, in a 5-4 decision, said states were free to restrict eminent domain seizures, and many states already have. A proposal to change Connecticut's law died during this year's legislative session.
 Both Mr. Malloy and Mr. DeStefano said the state's eminent domain law should be adjusted to limit the taking of property for economic development, but neither said the law should be scrapped. 
 In a somewhat heated exchange, Mr. Malloy criticized Mr. DeStefano for not agreeing to return campaign funds if the state's new campaign finance law had taken effect in this year's election cycle instead of in 2008's. The law will set up a voluntary public financing system for statewide races and ban campaign contributions from lobbyists, their families and state contractors.

 BODY:

SHOWDOWN OVER STEM CELLS -- The United States Senate defied a veto threat by President Bush and approved legislation that would expand federal support of medical research using embryonic stem cells. White House officials said Mr. Bush planned to veto the measure, ignoring substantial support from Senate Republicans. [Page A1.] 


INCHING FORWARD ON RESEARCH -- A bill approved by the Senate to bolster stem cell research is expected to help ease restrictions that have burdened laboratories with red tape, reduced American competitiveness and discouraged young researchers from entering the field. But the legislation by itself would not immediately provide an overall increase in money for the research. [A18.]

YAHOO IN A SLIDE -- Shares of Yahoo fell to their lowest level in nearly two years in after-hours trading as it reported weak revenue from Internet search advertising in the second quarter and a delay in a project meant to match the technology of Google, its chief rival. [C1.]

FRONT-PAGE NEWS, AND ADS -- The Wall Street Journal confirmed long-standing speculation that it would open its front page to advertisers, probably in September, a move that could bring in tens of millions of dollars a year in ad revenue. The ad, informally called a ''jewel box'' and to appear in the bottom right corner, will showcase some of the paper's most valued advertisers. [C1.]

A FOX MORNING TALK SHOW -- Beginning in January, the 35 stations in the Fox group will broadcast a live morning show, to be seen at 9 a.m. in most cities. The show, with Juliet Huddy, left, and Mike Jerrick, currently the hosts of ''DaySide'' on Fox News, will generally forgo hard news for segments on entertainment and lifestyle. [E1.]

BOOM IN PRIVATE PRISONS -- As the country gets tougher on illegal immigration and increases enforcement, some of the biggest beneficiaries may be the companies that have been building and running private prisons. By late next year, the administration expects that about 27,500 immigrants will be in detention each night. At an average cost of $95 a night, that adds up to nearly $1 billion a year. [C1.]

DISNEY TIGHTENS ITS BELT -- The Walt Disney Company said it would eliminate 650 jobs, change some of its top managers and trim the number of movies it releases to 12 to 13 a year, from about 18. [C1.]

STRONG QUARTER FOR MERRILL -- Quarterly profit at Merrill Lynch climbed 42 percent, aided by a strong performance in stock trading despite a downturn in the markets. Merrill Lynch said it had a profit of $1.58 billion, compared with $1.14 billion in the second quarter of 2005. Revenue increased 29 percent, to $8.2 billion. [C4.]

BATTLE OF THE MICROPROCESSORS -- Advanced Micro Devices, with Phil Hester as its technology officer, has regained some of the market share it had lost to Intel, but the battle for supremacy in producing ever-faster microprocessors has only intensified. Intel has been fighting back with discounts and new designs. [C7.]

THE STAKES GET BIGGER -- The online gambling industry was thrown into turmoil after the federal government arrested a top executive from a London betting company, leaving his competitors wondering whether they could be next. Stock prices of the industry's biggest names, including PartyGaming and SportingBet, plummeted on fears that companies could face charges of criminal racketeering. [C5.]

COMPLETING AN ERRATIC COURSE -- The V-22 Osprey, a helicopter-airplane hybrid made specifically for the United States Marine Corps, made its public debut at an air show in England. At a cost 0f $70 million each, its makers, Bell Helicopter and Boeing, hope it can overcome a troubled 20-year history. [C4.]

AN UNEXPECTED WHOLESALE RISE -- Higher costs of food and energy pushed up wholesale prices in June to an unexpectedly high level, leaving economists to debate whether prices might be rising too quickly. The Labor Department said that the Producer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in June, after a 0.2 percent increase in May. [C6.]

ON A WING AND A PRAYER -- Joe Sharkey, business travel writer for The Times, says airport chapels are good places to find peace and solitude in busy airports. His report is at nytimes.com/business.

AN EXTREME MAKEOVER -- The new wealth in Russia, spurred by oil and gas production, has created a rush for European and American interior designers, homegrown and imported. A report is at nytimes.com/style.

HEADLINE: Times Company Profit Flat; Internet Revenue Increasing 

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported second-quarter earnings yesterday that were essentially flat, in large part because of continued advertising weakness in New England.
 The company reported some modest financial gains for the quarter, saying that net income increased slightly, to $61.3 million, from $60.8 million in the period a year ago. Earnings per share were unchanged at 42 cents. 
 Total revenue was up 1.6 percent, to $858.7 million, with advertising revenue up 1 percent and circulation revenue up 0.6 percent. Other revenue, including from TimesSelect and commercial printing, was up 12.6 percent.
 Operating profit fell to $99.1 million, from $106.5 million in the period a year ago.
 The New York Times Media Group, which includes The New York Times, nytimes.com, The International Herald Tribune and IHT.com, continued to post slight gains while the New England Media Group -- primarily The Boston Globe -- continued to be a drag on overall results.
 Advertising revenue for The New York Times Media Group for the second quarter was up 1.4 percent from a year ago, and revenue from circulation was up 2.8 percent.
 Advertising revenue for the New England Media Group was down 10.4 percent, and revenue from circulation was down 7.2 percent.
 ''New England continues to grapple with a difficult economic climate,'' Janet L. Robinson, president and chief executive of the company, told financial analysts in a conference call.
 She said the regional unit had been hurt mainly by the loss of advertising stemming from department store consolidation. But she also said she expected the climate to improve with the expansion of other department stores, including Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. 
 The company's total costs were up 2.9 percent in the second quarter, to $759.7 million, mainly because of the costs associated with newsprint, which rose 7.4 percent. The higher prices for newsprint were partly offset by lower consumption, the company said.
 Internet revenue continues to increase and now accounts for 7.7 percent of total revenue, up from 5.8 percent in the second quarter of last year. The Internet-related businesses generated $66.1 million in revenue, up from $49 million.
 The earnings report came after an announcement by the company on Monday that it planned to cut costs on newsprint by reducing the size of the pages of The New York Times. As of April 2008, the pages will become one and a half inches narrower. 
 The company also plans to close its printing operations in Edison, N.J., and combine them with its production plant in College Point, Queens. It will sublet the Edison plant, the company said.
 The plant consolidation means that by spring 2008, the company will cut about 250 production-related jobs, about a third of its total production work force in the New York region. 
 The company eliminated 700 other jobs over the last year. By the end of this year, the overall work force will have been cut 17 percent, to 11,400 employees, from 13,800 employees in 2001. 
 Leonard P. Forman, the chief financial officer, said the reduction in staff size would allow the company to rent out more space in its new building in Midtown Manhattan, which it is planning to move into by the second quarter of next year.

HEADLINE: New Hudson Rail Tunnel Is Nearing Federal Approval

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 18 

 BODY:
New Jersey Transit is expected to get authorization this week from federal transit officials to begin preliminary engineering work on constructing a second two-track train tunnel under the Hudson River into Manhattan.
 The anticipated federal approval was called a ''significant milestone'' on Tuesday by Gov. Jon S. Corzine and transit advocacy groups in the 15-year effort to build support for the estimated $6 billion project.
The second tunnel would allow for a significant increase in the number of Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains entering and leaving New York. The current tunnel can accommodate only 19 trains an hour at peak times and remains the choke point in the system. 
 Governor Corzine, who as a United States senator from New Jersey pushed for the crucial language in an appropriation bill that indicated the project enjoyed strong regional support, called the expected authorization ''further confirmation that we are moving this along.''
 ''I have a goal of putting a shovel in the ground on this project by 2009,'' he said in an interview. ''Then I will feel that I have done something as a U.S. senator.''
 Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who over the years had sponsored appropriation bills that have funneled $22 million to New Jersey in federal planning money for the project, said he was eagerly anticipating the authorization. He added, jokingly, that ''you know this will connect the Frank R. Lautenberg Station in Secaucus with the planned Daniel P. Moynihan Station in Manhattan.''
 The new tunnel would go to the proposed Moynihan station and the basement at Macy's in Manhattan.
 Senator Robert Menendez, who replaced Mr. Corzine in Washington, said the project would add 44,000 jobs and $10 billion to the economy.
 Paul Griffo, a spokesman for the Federal Transit Administration, said the agency would notify Congress this week of its decision to allow planning to continue. The next step in receiving full federal financing for the project is the final design.
 ''All of these hurdles must be cleared to get to the holy grail of a full funding grant agreement,'' said Mr. Griffo, adding that the process takes from 6 to 12 years. The federal government's contribution would be limited to 80 percent of the project's cost. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has agreed to pay $2 billion for the project. The rest could come from New Jersey. Mr. Griffo said the transit agency is eligible for federal grants.
 The idea of a second train tunnel between Manhattan and New Jersey has been talked about since the early 1990's as a way of easing traffic jams on the roads and expanding economic opportunities for the two states. The need for the second tunnel became more pronounced after service began on the Morris-Essex Line in 1996, followed by the Montclair-Boonton Line in 2002.
 For much of that time New York officials had been cool to the idea, seeing it mostly as a project that aided only New Jersey and competed with New York projects seeking federal financing. But in recent years, according to Thomas Wright, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, New York officials have come to view it as fitting in with the redevelopment of the Far West Side of Manhattan, and as a necessary backup to the current tunnel since 9/11.
 ''Had New York opposed the tunnel, it would have been easy for the federal government to turn it down,'' Mr. Wright said. ''But we have studies showing that between 1980 and 2000, 89 percent of new commuters into the city came from west of the Hudson, and this is the group from which an expanded Manhattan business district will be drawing.''
 Jon Orcutt, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit mass transit advocacy group, said that the only problem on the horizon for New Jersey was whether it would have enough revenue coming into its Transportation Trust Fund to finance the state's part of the cost over the next five to six years.
 Governor Corzine said the state was prepared to put $500 million into the project over the next five to six years. Thereafter, the state plans to replenish the trust fund, he said, for what he termed would be an ''extraordinary centerpiece of an effective and efficient mass transit system for the region.''

HEADLINE: Putin Favorite Re-emerging In Ukraine 

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 18 

 BODY:
Viktor F. Yanukovich, the Russia-backed Ukrainian politician vanquished by the Orange Revolution of 2004, was poised Tuesday to make a spectacular comeback as prime minister after the pro-West president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, said his party would not join a broad governing coalition. 
 With Mr. Yushchenko saying he would take his Our Ukraine party into the parliamentary opposition, Ukraine appeared on course to be led by Mr. Yanukovich. At the same time, a political rival, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, accused Mr. Yanukovich of staging a coup. 
 Mr. Yanukovich, 56, had the strong support of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during the first round of presidential elections in November 2004, in which he declared himself the winner. But after hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets, claiming election fraud, a new election was held in January 2005 and was won by Mr. Yushchenko.
 Public support for Mr. Yushchenko's party has suffered amid infighting and accusations of corruption, which opened the door for Mr. Yanukovich to make a comeback in parliamentary elections in March. His Party of the Regions won the most votes, but not enough to form a stable government. Since then, Ukraine has been in political limbo.
 Two previous attempts to form a governing coalition have failed, but now the Communists and Socialists have thrown their support behind Mr. Yanukovich. On Tuesday, his supporters said they had enough allies in Parliament to govern Ukraine.
 ''We have removed all barriers for the president'' to submit Mr. Yanukovich's name for prime minister, said Evhen Kushnaryov, a Party of the Regions senior official.
 Ms. Tymoshenko, a leader of the pro-democratic Orange Revolution of December 2004 and a former prime minister, retorted that opposition members should now give up their parliamentary mandates, declare the government illegitimate and dissolve Parliament under constitutional rules.
 ''I want people of good will, intelligent people who don't consider Ukraine's independence to be empty words, to understand that a political coup is taking place today in Parliament,'' she said.
 Mr. Yushchenko tried after the March elections to create a stable coalition with Ms. Tymoshenko, in a deal that would have restored her to the prime minister post he had fired her from only months before. But the agreement depended on support from the Socialist Party, and the coalition collapsed two weeks ago when the Socialists defected to the Yanukovich camp.
 Given the political tensions in the government, analysts were skeptical that Mr. Yanukovich could usher in the stability needed to introduce economic and political reforms and complete the country's negotiations to join the World Trade Organization.
 Mr. Yanukovich's alliance with the Communist and Socialist parties, which oppose membership in NATO as his party does, decreases the chances that the Bush administration will be able to offer Ukraine a timetable for membership during a meeting of NATO leaders in November in Riga, Latvia.
 Mr. Yushchenko had promised radical reforms demanded by the supporters of the Orange Revolution.
 Since then, because of new constitutional rules introduced in January, he has been stripped of some of his most important presidential powers, including the right to appoint the prime minister. He has, however, the right to nominate the powerful ministers of defense and foreign affairs.
 ''The president remains an important player,'' said Olexiy Haran, regional vice president of the Kiev office of the Eurasia Foundation, an American-based group that gives grants in the former Soviet Union. ''The effective working of any cabinet will depend on cohabitation with the president.''
 Mr. Yanukovich has until Tuesday to create a cabinet; if he fails, Mr. Yushchenko has the right to dissolve Parliament and call new elections.

HEADLINE: Republicans Propose National School Voucher Program

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18 

 BODY:
With Education Secretary Margaret Spellings joining them in a show of support, Congressional Republicans proposed Tuesday to spend $100 million on vouchers for low-income students in chronically failing public schools around the country to attend private and religious schools. 
 The legislation, modeled on a pilot program here, would pay for tuition and private tutoring for some 28,000 students seeking a way out of public schools that fail to raise test scores sufficiently for at least five years.
The proposal comes as Republicans are showcasing issues intended to energize their party's conservative base before the midterm elections. Congressional leaders said it would probably be taken up only next year, when Congress is supposed to update the federal education law known as No Child Left Behind.
 Congress has so far approved only limited programs using taxpayer dollars to pay for private school education: the program here, and one to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina.
 The new legislation was introduced after an Education Department report released Friday, which showed that students attending public schools generally did as well as or better than comparable students in private schools. 
 That report examined test scores of 700,000 fourth and eighth graders at public schools and those of 25,000 private school students. It found that when students of like economic, racial and family backgrounds were compared, public school students did as well as or better than those in private school in fourth grade reading and math and in eighth grade math. The exception was eighth grade reading, in which private school students did better.
 Opponents of school vouchers seized on those findings. Citing the report, Ralph Neas, president of the liberal nonprofit group People for the American Way, said: ''The goal of this movement isn't to help students. It's to achieve vouchers at any cost.''
 Ms. Spellings, at the news conference, called the report's sample small and its results ''basically inconclusive.''
 She said she had learned of the study -- put out by a branch of the Education Department -- only through the newspapers on Saturday and had not read it. She said that the Education Department had not tried to bury the report, as a teachers union leader had charged, by releasing it on a summer Friday. ''My philosophy on reports out of the Department of Education is that we shouldn't do it on a Friday,'' she said.
 Grover J. Whitehurst, director of the Institute of Education Sciences at the Education Department, said that the secretary's office had received the report for review two weeks before its release. 
 Mr. Whitehurst said that his office was responsible for failing to alert the secretary to the report's importance. 
 Whatever the report's findings, Ms. Spellings said, parents with children in public schools that repeatedly fail deserve more options.
 ''The thing we wake up worrying about every day at the Department of Education is grade level proficiency for every child by 2013-2014,'' Ms. Spellings said. ''Often that will be found in a public school. But when that doesn't happen, what do we do?'' 
 The legislation is sponsored by Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and John Ensign of Nevada in the Senate, and by Howard P. McKeon of California and Sam Johnson of Texas in the House.

HEADLINE: Two Leaders Whose Friendship Has an Edge

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, July 17 

 BODY:
United States and Russian officials say that despite some appearances, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin got along famously at the Group of 8 summit meeting this week, and that their relationship is at one of its highest points in its five-year history.
 Still, though the officials said there were great areas of agreement, they did not work quite as hard to deny analyses that competitive friction between the nations was as high as it had been in years. And while the cold war may be over, its icy residue could have frozen even the strongest vodka during the summit meetings between leaders of the economic powers gathered at the Konstantinovsky Palace near here. 
Indeed, Russian officials clearly indicated that they were less than pleased that Mr. Bush made his first stop here a visit with Mr. Putin's leading critics in the increasingly isolated community of activists who accuse him of rolling back democratic freedoms. 
 And so it was that the Russians had a parting shot for Mr. Bush, this one on the Web site set up for the meeting. Along with headings for news releases about summit happenings there was this one: ''U.S. President Avoids Media After G8 Summit.'' The release went on, ''George W. Bush was the only G8 leader who refused to talk to the press after the St. Petersburg summit.'' Mr. Putin, it noted, ''met journalists more often than his counterparts.''

Rooms With Ears
 American officials are always wary of being spied on when they come to Russia. But on this visit, officials said they had very little doubt that their suspicions were correct: the attic and basement of Mr. Bush's ''cottage'' were sealed off from him and his security detail.
 American officials, granted anonymity in order to speak freely, joked that the rooms were filled with listening equipment. But in case the joke was true, they identified what they were confident was a single bug-free place in which to have more serious discussions, and otherwise kept sensitive talks to the limousine.
 Even so, the Russians often seemed to know about American logistical plans before the Americans told them, the officials said. 
 And in the end, it was on the closing day of the summit meeting that not only Russian security agents but indeed the world got to hear one of the most extensive unscripted presidential moments of Mr. Bush's tenure, broadcast from an open microphone by the Russian television service covering the meeting. 
 But American officials seemed content to leave it to reporters to raise suspicion over how it was that Mr. Bush was the only leader whose microphone was on during lunch.

But Still
 Yet for all of this, officials said Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush shared more than a few laughs. On the summit meeting's television feed, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin were seen tooling around the palace grounds together in golf carts. 
 And on the tape that the television service provided of Mr. Bush's unscripted moment, Mr. Putin is heard to agree with Mr. Bush as he complains, ''Some of these guys talk too long.'' Mr. Putin is also heard laughing with Mr. Bush when Mr. Bush says he is eager to get home, and adds, ''You'll want me out of town so to free up your security forces.'' In return, Mr. Putin says, ''Ya!'' 
 An official who was at a lunch that followed their feisty joint media briefing on Saturday said they had united to make fun of President Jacques Chirac of France, with Mr. Putin joking, ''My next big goal is to find a way that Jacques Chirac won't complain about the food.''
 That brought to mind comments before the last Group of 8 summit in Scotland, when a tape recorder picked up Mr. Chirac speaking with Mr. Putin and the German chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schroder, saying of the British, ''You can't trust people who cook as badly as that.'' Even then, Mr. Putin could not resist a dig at the Americans, saying, ''But what about hamburgers?''
