HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: THE DOMESTIC FALLOUT;
The Risks to America in Asia's Plummeting Markets

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Since he came to office President Clinton has repeated, time and again, that America's economic fortunes are tied to the spectacular growth of the powerhouses of the Pacific Rim. And the business world was far ahead of him, already building ventures from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong to New York.
But shared prosperity brings with it shared risk. And the question now is whether the financial earthquake that started somewhere under Thailand early this summer, and spread to Indonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong, will end up here. 
 Some of the many possibilities being discussed on Wall Street and at the Treasury Department today were that the United States could become a safe haven for investors who now believe there is no place in Asia to hide -- not even Hong Kong, which today saw the biggest one-day market drop since the killings at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
But there is little question that the United States is at risk. Consider that in 1995, when Mexico plunged into a similar crisis after a currency devaluation late the previous year, America did about $100 billion in business across its southern border. That was a big figure -- big enough to spur President Clinton to bail out the Mexican economy. But it is dwarfed by United States trade with Asia, which last year was just shy of $300 billion, even without Japan.
Yet in Washington, there is no talk of a Mexico-pattern rescue for Southeast Asia, because the problems there vary greatly from country to country -- and in some places are barely understood at all.
"Mexico was relatively clean, one country with a diagnosable set of problems," a senior Administration official said recently.
But in Asia there is no such simplicity. Thailand suffers from a banking system built on a house of cards and a property market gone wild; Malaysia from trade and investment deficits; Indonesia from corruption and dubious accounting. But none of the quick fixes and austerity measures attempted over a long, hot summer of currency runs has succeeded in re-establishing confidence.
And now the crisis has hit Hong Kong -- the well-regulated, British-designed center of commerce that the rest of Asia was told to emulate.
It is Hong Kong's crisis that has alarmed the Clinton Administration as it finds itself struggling to douse the few flames that jumped the Pacific today, sending Wall Street stocks down more than 2 percent and many markets in Europe, 3 percent-plus. But American officials seemed to decide that anything they might say would only make a bad situation worse.
In his one public appearance today, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin sidestepped a question about the markets by pointing to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who was sharing a platform, a joint appearance to press Congress into giving President Clinton new negotiating authority for trade accords.
"I will pass that question to the Secretary of State," Mr. Rubin said. "She is highly trained in the art of diplomacy -- talking a lot and not saying too much."
Nonetheless, American officials today were trying to think through a range of short- and long-term implications of the Asian markets' plunge.
The most obvious is the effect on exports. The first casualty of the Asian crisis is the cancellation or delay of scores of major public works projects, from dams and bridges in Indonesia, to a desperately needed light-rail project in Bangkok, to many elements of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ambitious plan to turn Malaysia into the Silicon Valley of Southeast Asia.
American technology underlies many of those projects, and over the next few months major companies could be scaling back their profit estimates as big-ticket sales evaporate. That alone would not be so worrisome. But with Japan still in recession, and Europeans crawling their way out of double-digit unemployment, those projects were among the hottest tickets in the world.
Perhaps the bigger political risk in Washington is that the trade deficit with Asian nations is almost certain to rise, and rise sharply. Not only are their consumers becoming more frugal, but the wave after wave of currency devaluations are making Asian goods a lot cheaper. For the Clinton Administration, that is bound to cause a revival of political tensions, especially if the widening trade gap is combined with a slowing United States economy.
Harder to predict is the effect on the American stock and bond markets. While stocks were hurt today, bonds gained and the dollar rose against Asian currencies, suggesting that investors around the world were desperately seeking safety -- and found it here.
So the biggest impact indeed seems the political one. Underlying the Clinton Administration's drive to increase economic engagement with Asia was a sense that American influence through the region had been in decline. Washington's reaction so far has done nothing to reverse that view.
"There were a lot of Asians wondering why the Americans sat out during the emergency package for Thailand," said C. Fred Bergsten, president of the Institute for International Economics here, and a central figure in the first meetings that brought together heads of state from the nations that make up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC. "In their view, it is another test of Washington's commitment."
Today, the American representative to APEC, John S. Wolf, seemingly took note of Asians' ambivalent feelings when he told reporters: "Some are saying the United States and developed countries actually welcome the financial crisis now happening. Nothing could be more wrong."
But whether they are suspicious of the American reaction or not, the Asians are bound to be more cautious about opening their markets.
Many leaders in the region blame their moves toward openness, and the pressures to allow in even more foreign competition, for increasing the volatility of their currencies. While few subscribe to Prime Minister Mahathir's accusation that Southeast Asia was made a target for devaluation by a Jewish conspiracy, or at least by evil currency speculators, many say they share his suspicion that the West is perfectly happy to see the Asians, tigers and others, declawed.

A front-page article and another in Business Day yesterday, and a chart showing the performance of stock markets around the world, misstated the German DAX 30 index. It closed on Thursday at 3,977.26 points, not 3,976.38. It was down 4.66 percent for the day, not 3.60 percent, and down 9.79 percent since Aug. 1, not 8.31 percent.

PRELUDE -- The morning session in Japan and the first few hours of trading in Australia were unexceptional. Japanese markets close for lunch just as Hong Kong begins trading.
 
BLOODBATH -- Stocks in Hong Kong open much lower, rally briefly and then dive more than 10 percent further in just over an hour. Bargain hunters manage a rally to end the morning session.
 
THE FIRST CASUALTIES -- Hong Kong's early selloff pushes Australian and Japanese shares down sharply; later rallies fade when Hong Kong breaks for lunch and fears begin to mount that Hong Kong's afternoon session will bring another debacle. Waves of panic selling and bargain buying send stocks gyrating wildly in Hong Kong's afternoon session.
 
EUROPE REACTS -- Stocks in Europe begin trading just as Hong Kong's day ends and the final extent of its damage is known. Major markets open sharply lower or fall in their first minutes, and drift further down for most of their sessions.
 
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC -- American stocks react much the way Europe's did, but prices in Latin America are hit harder, as traders worry that economies there are vulnerable to the same pressures that have hammered Asia.

HEADLINE: THE ASIAN CRISIS: MARKET PLACE;
Thailand's Currency Flutters, And Wind Is Felt in the U.S.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Can the economic troubles of Thailand, a small country in Southeast Asia, really have begun the processes now causing currency turmoil through much of Asia and producing selloffs in nearly every stock market in the world?
Yes. 
 But the processes have been complicated, and have taken months to shake the confidence of international investors and the bull markets around the world. By yesterday, that confidence had plunged, and stock markets fell sharply. The selloff in the United States, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 2.3 percent, was the mildest among major markets. It was a selloff that began in Hong Kong, where the stock market has fallen 23 percent this week.
The effect of all the turmoil in Asia will almost certainly mean slower economic growth in that area and lower profits for some American and other multinational companies. And those Americans who invested in some mutual funds devoted to Asian markets have lost billions of dollars.
But until this week, most economists had thought the impacts -- both economic and financial -- would be minor. The selloffs, however, have raised the specter of a worldwide loss of investor confidence. Were that to happen, the economic impact could be much greater.
Most countries in Southeast Asia had chosen to tie their currencies to the dollar, with an exchange rate that is fixed or allowed to narrowly fluctuate. That had advantages for businesses, which could plan with some certainty, but it defied the fact that the economies were performing differently from the United States economy and each other.
Over time, Thailand -- the first of the countries to suffer -- found itself with a currency that was overvalued. Imports were flooding in as Thais bought foreign luxury goods, and exports stagnated. Some international speculators began to bet the currency would be devalued. They did that by borrowing the currency -- called the baht -- and selling baht for dollars or other currencies. They would profit if they could later repurchase the baht for less.
Thailand's responded with fury. It denounced speculators and took steps to punish them. It raised interest rates -- making it more expensive to borrow baht -- and prohibited some foreigners from possessing baht. That briefly strengthened the baht, and some speculators suffered substantial losses.
But in the meantime, many Thais, particularly business people, became worried. They had borrowed dollars to finance their businesses, rather than borrowing baht, because interest rates in dollars were lower. If the baht were to fall, they would be in trouble, since the dollars needed to repay loans would cost a lot more baht. So many Thais bought dollars to protect themselves. And that buying, coupled with that of international speculators, overwhelmed the Thai Government's defenses.
"When you have currencies under pressure, almost everyone becomes a speculator," Peter Allen, the head of emerging markets research at BankBoston, said yesterday.
That process has been repeated in several Asian countries, among them Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Now it has spread to Hong Kong, a darling of international investors even after China retook control on July 1. The Hong Kong dollar has been fixed to the American dollar since 1984, under a system known as a currency board. Hong Kong currency is issued not by the Government, but by three banks. For every Hong Kong dollar they issue, they must deposit an equivalent number of American dollars.
Hong Kong's interest rates have also been closer to American ones, and few people thought the currency was likely to succumb to pressure. But speculation it might nonetheless led to some of the same selling seen in other markets.
To keep the currency stable, the annual interest rate on money borrowed for one night rose to as high as 300 percent. That makes it very expensive to speculate against the currency, and yesterday, even as Hong Kong stocks plunged, the Hong Kong dollar rose a bit -- evidently as currency speculators retreated.
John Greenwood, the chief economist for GT Global, a mutual fund management company and a man named to the Order of the British Empire for his role in conceiving the Hong Kong currency system in 1984, said yesterday that he expected the Hong Kong currency to hold its value. But he noted that selling pressure had been greater than at any time since the Tiananmen Square killings in Beijing in 1989.
He also said that were high rates to continue for months -- even at 30 percent or so -- it would depress the Hong Kong economy.
It has taken months to persuade many investors that there was more to this crisis than currency values. When the baht cracked in July, Thai stocks rallied. (They have since fallen.) Numerous analysts opined that Thailand and other Asian countrieshad buoyant economies that would perhaps grow even stronger since they were now blessed with cheaper currencies, making their exports more competitive. Some investors who withdrew money from Asia moved it to Latin America, confident that emerging markets were the place to be.
But gradually, fear has set in that Asia, the strongest economic region in recent years, might be in trouble. That has set off alarms about growth elsewhere.
Against the backdrop of record-high stock markets around much of the world, the worries led to waves of selling yesterday, first in Asia, then in Europe, then in the Americas. Latin America was especially hit, but the United States got off relatively lightly. In fact, after strong rallies earlier this week on strong profits from companies like I.B.M. and Microsoft, major American stock indexes remain higher for the week even after yesterday's selloff.
For the American economy, the direct implications of the Asian turmoil are clearly negative, but have seemed likely to be mild. They will depress the profits of companies that sell things to the affected Asian countries. Relatively few Southeast Asian exports compete directly with American products, but those that do will likely be cheaper and thus do better. That could, of course, be good news for American consumers.
The stock market selloffs yesterday smacked of panic, and panic usually abates within a few days. In fact, a security traded on the American Stock Exchange, equivalent to a basket of Hong Kong stocks, ended yesterday 3 percent higher than the Hong Kong market had been, indicating some traders expected Hong Kong to at least partly recover today. The longer-term question will be whether the Asian turmoil means world growth is likely to slow significantly. Were that the case, the high level of stock prices that has prevailed here and abroad could be in serious danger.

HEADLINE: Success and the Black Magazine;
As Readers Prosper, Advertising Still Eludes Publishers

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 24

 BODY:
As Edward Lewis tells the story, his wife was approached at a 1992 party by the cosmetics executive Leonard A. Lauder, chairman of the Estee Lauder Companies, who joked, "Ed Lewis never smiles."
"He would smile," she replied, "if you advertised in his magazine." 
 Whether her remark did the trick or not, the Lauder companies began advertising in Essence magazine soon afterward. More to the point, though, this tale gives some sense of the difficulty black magazines still confront in securing high-end advertising.
Although such hurdles have persisted throughout the 27 years since Mr. Lewis helped found Essence, a life-style magazine for black women, he has managed to build Essence Communications Inc. into a $100 million publishing business.
And today, at the American Magazine Conference here, Mr. Lewis was named chairman of the Magazine Publishers of America, making him the first black to head the 78-year-old trade group, which represents more than 700 magazines.
Mr. Lewis, 57, his company's chairman and chief executive, takes the helm of the publishers association at a time of both promise and frustration for black magazines. As blacks have become more educated and prosperous in recent years, mainstream magazines are paying increasing attention to them, and a number of new publications have come along to compete for that market. Yet black publishers say much of the advertising industry remains stubbornly resistant.
"We've come a long way," Mr. Lewis said in an interview at his Manhattan office, overlooking Times Square. "We've got a long way to go."
People in the industry give varying explanations for the obstacles. Black publishing executives say that media planners tend to be young whites who do not read or relate to black publications and that residual racism leads advertisers to assume that black readers do not have money to spend.
But advertising people say they can reach blacks better through television than through print media. They also say blacks have become a larger part of the general magazine audience, making it unnecessary to seek them in black publications.
"As African-Americans have become more mainstream and middle class, we do seem to assume we're reaching them through mainstream television and magazines," said Gene DeWitt, president of DeWitt Media, a media buying agency.
Black publishing executives say the election of Mr. Lewis sends a powerful, much-needed signal to the industry that minority readers matter.
"It's a tremendous statement and a tremendous opportunity for the magazine industry to take a hard look at itself," said Roy S. Johnson, an editor at large at Fortune magazine, who has been developing a magazine for blacks that Time Inc. hopes to produce jointly with Essence.
"No magazine should be published without people of color in its pages," he said, "whether it's a parents magazine, a business magazine or a travel magazine."
Donald D. Kummerfeld, president of the publishers group, emphasized that Mr. Lewis's appointment was not intended as a mere symbol. "He earned it just as much as every other chair," Mr. Kummerfeld said. "That being said, one of our goals is to see that our industry reflects the diversity of its readers."
Blacks' total earned income was $367 billion in 1996, up from an inflation-adjusted $243 billion in 1980, and black households are spending more than white ones on new cars, clothing and home furnishings, according to the latest edition of "The Buying Power of Black America," an annual report compiled by Target Market News, a Chicago research firm.
Spending by blacks on new appliances doubled, to $2.2 billion, from 1995 to 1996, and spending for furnishings rose from $8.3 billion, to $10.4 billion. The roughly 12 million black households spent $175 million on magazines last year, Target said.
As a result, mainstream magazines have been covering blacks more thoroughly, which might lead some black readers to feel less need for publications directed exclusively at them.
The fashion magazine Elle, for example, features a black model on its November cover. And Fortune's August issue on "new black power," profiling prominent blacks in business, was its second-best-selling cover of the year to date, after an issue that featured America's most admired companies.
But while Mr. Lewis concedes that such nibbles at his market keep Essence on its toes, he remains confident that black women will continue to need a magazine of their own. "Black women read other magazines," he said. "But they also want to see themselves."
Sure enough, established black magazines like Essence, Ebony and Black Enterprise all show ad page increases of 2 percent to 11 percent through September, although Essence's paid circulation declined one-tenth of a percent for the six months ended June 1997 and Ebony's fell 7.4 percent. (At Black Enterprise, which is published by Earl G. Graves Ltd., circulation was up 2.5 percent.)
Newer titles are also looking to get in on the action. These include Heart & Soul, a health and fitness magazine for black women published by Rodale Press, which publishes the successful Men's Health, among others; American Legacy, a quarterly black history and culture magazine jointly published by the American Heritage division of Forbes and RJR Communications, which is distributed in unconventional places like black churches and colleges; B.E.T. Weekend, a black entertainment and life-style magazine inserted into newspapers, published jointly by The Daily News in New York and Black Entertainment Television, which also publishes the black news magazine Emerge, and Black Child, a magazine for black parents, published by Interrace Publications in Atlanta.
Mr. Lewis, it would seem, should smile when he surveys this growing market, which he has done so much to nurture.
Essence, after all, has won several awards and built its circulation to one million. And while its second and third issues had only five ad pages each, the magazine expects to end this year with more than 1,000.
Mr. Lewis, who used to be known as Stone Face Lewis, does smile more these days, but he is not satisfied. "Some people will say, 'What are you whining about?' " he said. "But it's not good enough."
Along with his partner, Clarence O. Smith, the president of Essence, Mr. Lewis has big ideas for Essence Communications. "I want to be like Time Warner," Mr. Lewis said. "If Time Warner can employ over 30,000 people, I want Essence Communications to employ over 30,000 people."
With about 150 employees at Essence now, Mr. Lewis sounds like a dreamer. But he has already made some progress toward expanding the franchise. In 1992, Essence acquired the business magazine Income Opportunities from Davis Publishing. Last year it entered a joint venture to publish Latina, a magazine for Hispanic women, and it is considering teaming up with Time Inc. to produce Savoy, a black life-style magazine.
Essence has extended its brand name to a mail-order catalogue as well as an entertainment division that every year produces the nationally televised Essence awards at Madison Square Garden's theater and a four-day Essence music festival at the Superdome in New Orleans.
And, with its February issue, Essence plans to come out with a comprehensive redesign that will add several sections and increase beauty, fashion and home coverage; introduce a binding with a flat spine to allow more advertiser inserts and coupons, and make four-color ads available throughout the magazine. The magazine is also increasing its newsstand price in January to $2.75 from $2.50.
"We just cannot sit back and take our audience for granted," Mr. Lewis said. "We want to stay on top."
On one level, the general market has grown tougher, with more titles than ever vying for readers and ad dollars. But Essence and other black publications say they have an added burden: getting advertisers to understand them. "We always have to re-educate, retell our story," Mr. Lewis said. "The Glamours and the Vogues don't have to do that."
While black magazines have made significant progress in attracting automotive, tobacco and liquor advertisements, whole categories remain almost completely absent from their pages, like high-end fashion, travel and technology.
"Obviously we're not where we want to be," said John H. Johnson, publisher, chairman and chief executive of the Chicago-based Johnson Publishing Company, which publishes Ebony, Jet and Ebony Man. "None of us have done well in the fashion business with colognes and perfumes and designer clothes. Blacks wear them, but we so far haven't been able to convince advertisers that we do."
Despite the hurdles, Mr. Lewis has persevered, with a soft-spoken calm and courtly elegance that has won him friends in high places, like Bill Cosby and David N. Dinkins, the former Mayor of New York.
"You will not find a person anywhere that will find an unkind word to say about Ed Lewis," said Mr. Dinkins, one of several prominent blacks who joined Mr. Lewis in signing full-page newspaper ads on Aug. 27 condemning the treatment of Abner Louima, a Haitian who prosecutors say was tortured by police officers at a Brooklyn stationhouse.
Mr. Lewis spreads the credit around -- mainly to his partner, Mr. Smith, a former insurance salesman who helped found Essence in 1970. "He wants everything yesterday," Mr. Lewis said in characterizing their differences. "I can deal with tomorrow."
He also praises Essence's editor in chief of 16 years, Susan L. Taylor, saying she "gave Essence its soul."
"The definition of power is shared dependency," Mr. Lewis said.
The son of a beautician and a janitor who grew up in the South Bronx and became a New York All City fullback, Mr. Lewis went to the University of New Mexico on a football scholarship in 1958 -- one of five blacks out of 8,000 students. He majored in political science and international relations with a minor in Russian and Chinese history. After one unsuccessful year at Georgetown Law School, Mr. Lewis joined Citibank's executive training program and was fast on his way to becoming a loan officer when the entrepreneurial tug lured him away to start Essence.
He lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with his second wife, Carolyn Wright-Lewis, a speech pathologist with two grown daughters. If he doesn't walk to work, Mr. Lewis takes the subway or a car service and does not even bother trying to hail a taxi. "Just too many pass me by," Mr. Lewis said. "You can't imagine the frustration I feel."
One edge black magazines have is that prominent blacks make themselves available for in-depth interviews. Essence's cover article for October, for example, is a rare interview with the oldest daughter of Betty Shabazz, the widow of Malcolm X, who died from injuries in a fire set by her grandson. "We ask questions about their deepest thoughts and lives," said Ms. Taylor, the editor. "These are our people, and we care deeply about them."
While Essence might appear to be a black version of a mainstream women's magazine -- and includes conventional fare like beauty and fashion -- Mr. Lewis said it also addressed subjects of particular concern to black women, like single parenthood, child abuse, AIDS, abortion and welfare.
"We have one common denominator: that we are black," he said. "Because of what has happened in our history, we have always had to deal with these kinds of issues."

HEADLINE: As Turmoil Builds, Thai Leader Shuffles Cabinet

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Thailand's political turmoil widened today, with the Prime Minister shuffling his Cabinet, naming a new Finance Minister and pledging to hold early elections.
The actions followed a week of political infighting, street demonstrations and demands for Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's resignation, even as the Thai currency continued to plummet and the economy continued to sour. 
 At the epicenter of Asia's economic crisis, the country that was hit first and hardest, Thailand seems unable to come to grips with its most pressing issues.
More than two months after being promised a $17 billion credit line by the International Monetary Fund -- the second largest, after Mexico's $40 billion bailout in 1994 -- Thailand has barely begun to formulate the economic restructuring that is required for the recovery program.
People are asking, as a Thai banker put it: "Who is setting economic policy today? Is there an economic policy?"
With prices rising, the stock market falling, tens of thousands of jobs being lost and half the country's financial institutions closed down, Thailand is concerned not with recovery but politics.
For the last week, leaders of the fractious six-party coalition Government have been wrestling behind closed doors over a Cabinet reorganization and struggling to find a replacement for the Finance Minister, who quit last week.
On Tuesday the Prime Minister was reported to have been dissuaded at the last moment by his top general from seizing more powers by declaring a state of emergency that would have sent the country's financial markets into further disarray.
Calls for Mr. Chavalit's ouster have gained momentum in the press, which has begun calling him a "madman," and among the demonstrators in the streets. Now, supporters of the Prime Minister are threatening to bus farmers into the city for counter-demonstrations that raise the possibility of a violent confrontation.
"The Prime Minister is trying to get away with not changing anything," said Montree Sornpaisarn, a leader of the anti-Chavalit demonstrations. "We think it's time for the Thai people to help their country."
In the midst of this tumult, Government action on the economic crisis has come to a virtual standstill.
"You start to wonder what is going to happen and when will something happen and how quickly will they move to actually do something," said Daniel King, an American political scientist who found himself out of work when the local bank where he was working shut down.
"The decision-makers seem unwilling and incapable of making decisions and carrying out the plans they have promised to implement," he said. "We are at a standstill, and there is not much to point to to say Thailand is complying with the I.M.F. program."
So far the Government has raised the sales tax and made plans for spending cuts that will halt a number of projects like highways and rail lines that are essential to further growth. But when it took the difficult step of raising fuel taxes last week to meet a budget target demanded by the I.M.F., it quickly rescinded it in the face of public resistance.
Economic analysts generally agree that with quick, effective action, Thailand, like other ailing nations in Southeast Asia, can recover and resume its growth in two or three years or less.
Without such action, they say, the pain will increase and recovery will take much longer.
"If the right measures are not taken, this could well be a five- to seven-year recovery," said Roy Ramos, an economist with Goldman Sachs in Singapore. "Part of the problem in Thailand was that there was a denial of the problem and procrastination. You can't solve a problem by denial."
The political uncertainty has itself become one of Thailand's foremost economic problems as investor confidence slips lower and foreign lenders close off their credit lines.
During the boom times, when Thailand's economy was growing at 8 percent a year, private companies accumulated some $73 billion in debt abroad, $18 billion of which is scheduled to come due by the end of the year.
On Wednesday the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, a consulting company based in Hong Kong, warned of possible social unrest if Thailand's logjam is not broken.
"Economic problems are now so widespread that they are taking the Thai people into unknown territory and thus their response to painful new experiences cannot be easily predicted," it said.
"A clean sweep of the Government would do more than anything to guarantee stability. Indeed, it would be unwise to be optimistic about social harmony unless there is political change soon."
Both Moody's Investor Service and Standard and Poor's international credit rating agency have lowered Thailand's rating in the last few days. Their pessimistic assessments were based not on the country's economic fundamentals but on its ineffectual political leadership.
Standard and Poor's cited the country's patronage-based politics and its system of weak and fragmented governments that stymie the attempts of technocrats to put rigorous policies into effect.
Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya announced on Oct. 17 that he would resign after the Government retreated from the fuel tax increase. Several candidates were reported in the Thai press to have turned down the job before it was given today to Kosit Panpiemras, a banker, as part of the reorganization of the Cabinet.
The Prime Minister also said today that Parliament would debate a set of laws next month under a newly adopted Constitution that would allow a general election to be held as early as December.
The new Constitution is designed to change Thailand's system of vote-buying, which critics say drains the country's treasury and produces corrupt and ineffectual governments that spend much of their energy trying to earn back the huge amounts they spent in their campaigns.
In the last election, 10 months ago, according to a recent analysis, fully $800 million was spent buying votes.
Political analysts say another election -- and a new government -- may be the only way to get the country moving again. But if it is anything like the last one, they say, it could break the bank.

HEADLINE: U.S. Defends Weakened Rebuke to Iraqis

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The United States said today that despite the abstention of five countries on a Security Council resolution threatening new sanctions against Iraq, the vote sent a signal to Baghdad.
"We do regret the decision by France, Russia, China, Egypt and Kenya to abstain on this resolution," a State Department spokesman, Lee McClenny, said. "The bottom line is, the resolution passed." 
 The resolution, approved in a vote on Thursday, expressed the "firm intention" of the 15-member Security Council to ban the travel of Iraqi officials if they continue to hinder the work of United Nations weapons inspection teams.
Mr. McClenny said President Saddam Hussein of Iraq should understand the basic message: that the Security Council supports the inspection teams. "He should see clearly that if he continues to challenge that mandate, the Council intends to take further action," the spokesman said.
Economic sanctions were imposed after Iraq's defeat in the gulf war in 1991. Before these can be ended, United Nations monitors must confirm that Iraq has destroyed its major weapons systems.

HEADLINE: Fears of a Sale By Swiss Send Gold Plunging

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Gold prices plunged to the lowest level in more than 12 years yesterday after a Swiss Government panel recommended that the country sell about half its gold reserves, raising fears that other countries would do the same and inundate the market.
Although the Swiss Government might sell less gold than the panel recommended and might not undertake any sale for some time, the prospect that such a financially conservative bastion as Switzerland would even contemplate an enormous sale unnerved gold traders. Switzerland's gold reserves total 2,600 tons, the fifth-largest stockpile in the world. 
 This was just the latest blow to gold, once the main hedge against inflation and uncertainty. In another powerful sign of gold's diminishing allure, there was little demand for it this week despite the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia that roiled global stock markets around the world.
"The reaction to the crisis in Asia was important," said William O'Neill, director of commodity research at Merrill Lynch & Company. "People did not go into gold, they went into bonds or currency."
 The spot price of gold in New York fell $14.65 an ounce yesterday, or 4.5 percent, to $309 an ounce. It was the lowest level since March 1985.
Several forces have combined to depress the price of gold, which is down 16 percent so far this year. Analysts said one reason for the decline was that the United States economy had shown little sign of inflation. Indeed, one reason why stock markets in the United States and many other places have been rallying until recently is the absence of inflationary pressure.
"In the old days, if you were worried about inflation you went to gold," said Douglas M. Cohen, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "Now there are all sorts of hedges. It's tough to make the case that gold is the hedge that it once was."
 The end of Communism and the move to a single European currency have also detracted from the value of gold, thus recently many of the world's central banks have chosen to sell some of their gold reserves.
The last big drop in gold prices happened in July, when the central bank in Australia said that it had sold about two-thirds of its gold reserves over the previous six months. Belgium and a host of other countries have also hinted that they are considering selling some gold reserves.
 "For the last couple of years a lot of people have been questioning the value of gold; there was the feeling that a lot of central banks were losing their faith in gold," Mr. Cohen said. "This move today reinforces the view that gold is losing its place as a store of value."
 The Swiss Government panel's recommendations are a partial outgrowth of Switzerland's previously announced decision to consider restructuring its gold reserves to create a new fund that would benefit Holocaust victims and the disadvantaged.
The Swiss would profit immensely from a sale of gold, which has been carried on their books at an artificially low price for decades.
But the possible sale of up to 1,400 tons of its gold, about 45 million ounces, or 45 percent of Switzerland's total, was far more than anyone envisioned. Moreover, other central banks that have been retaining gold might feel pressured to unload gold before the price drops further.
"It's not the 1,400 tons that's significant; it's the sentiment," said Harry Bingham, the manager of institutional gold portfolios at Van Eck Associates, a mutual fund company. "Maybe other countries will see this and also want to sell."
 Still, there are those who remain bullish on gold, arguing that even in these times of relative political stability, the social and political environment could quickly shift and resurrect gold's allure.
 Mr. Bingham said if there was such a change, gold investors could find themselves suddenly wealthier, while others who have plowed money into other investments would be second-guessing themselves.
"You know the golden rule," Mr. Bingham said. "He who has the gold makes the rules. And to me, it's bullish for people who have gold. Paper doesn't have the intrinsic value gold does."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Investors Look (Hard) for the Silver Lining

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Along Des Voeux Road, in front of dozens and dozens of flickering market monitors, a sustained sigh of relief issued from anxious Hong Kong investors today.
As the day wore on, a battered stock market seemed to regain some of its bearings and begin to move upward. After a devastating Thursday, when the market plunged more than 1,200 points, or 10.4 percent, investors rushed today to buy stocks that seemed like bargains, And at the end of trading, the benchmark Hang Seng index was up 718.04 points, or 6.9 percent, at 11,144.34. 
 Still, pessimism seemed interwoven with hope all along Des Voeux Road, a stretch containing more than 20 banks through the central business district.
"You can't tell what's going to happen, but I think there's a chance that it will go down some more," said Lok Lai Kong as he took a commanding position in front of monitor at the Bank of Communications. "I've lost a lot, a whole lot. It's a very serious damage for me.
"My wife says when I lose at mah-jongg I get all upset," added Mr. Lok, who is 66 and, he said, happily retired. "But when I lose in the stock market, I still feel fine -- even in a good mood. Anyway, how much can I lose?"
At another screen, investors punched in numbers of their favorite stocks. "I lost probably half of what I invested," Alan Au, a 31-year-old cosmetics wholesaler, said ruefully. "Right now I'm going to wait a bit. It'll probably go up a little, then I'll sell some of what I have and rearrange my portfolio by buying some better ones. The market will probably go up again, and then it can drop down to 8,000 -- that's a possibility."
Inside brokerage houses nearby, delight over the market's rise was tangible, but the focus was on the Hong Kong dollar. The Government's determination to maintain the currency's 14-year link to the American dollar has driven interest rates sharply higher and acted as a drag on stocks.
At the same time, the collapse of other currencies in Southeast Asia against the American currency, and by implication against the Hong Kong dollar, has made this newly minted piece of China a very expensive place.
"There is still currency tension in the region," said Pauline Gately, regional strategist for BZW Asia. "Until that dissipates, Hong Kong will not be truly out of the woods. After Korea and Taiwan, the only real strong currency is the Hong Kong dollar, and speculators decided to have a go at it."
But while the speculators have been successful in driving down the currencies of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries in the region, Ms. Gately said, they may have miscalculated this time.
"The speculators initiated this, but there's also genuine demand for the Hong Kong dollar," she said. "We are very much of the view that the currency will hold. Today, the market has rallied; it will encounter some selling again. But we will have a better feel of where we stand in a week or so."
Hong Kong officials have said they will stave off assaults on their currency despite the cost. And Hong Kong has the wherewithal to fight: At the end of last month, it was holding $88.1 billion in foreign-currency reserves, a hard-currency trove surpassed only by Japan's and by that of China, which has stored up $130.3 billion.
Hong Kong can use that money to buy its own currency, reducing the supply of Hong Kong dollars on the market and thereby making them more expensive.
Tung Chee-hwa, the city's chief executive -- after returning from a European trip, on which he sought to persuade leaders that China's new rule had not altered Hong Kong's way of life -- wasted no time today in throwing down the gauntlet to speculators.
"We will make sure they do not succeed in whatever they try to do," said Mr. Tung, who was appointed by China to administer Hong Kong, and took over nearly four months ago on the transfer of power from the British. "Let me emphasize to you the government's determination to maintain the linked exchange rate," he went on. "It has served us well. It will continue to be important for our future prosperity."
In fighting off attacks on the Hong Kong dollar, which is fixed at a rate around 7.75 to 1 to American currency, monetary officials here pushed up overnight money market rates last night to a range of 250 to 280 percent, from 6 percent early this week.
At the same time, Mr. Tung was seeking to allay investors' concerns about the stock market's volatility. "The market has fallen," he said, "but at a certain level it becomes a good buy and then there will be buyers in the market, and the market will start to rebound."
Even so, economists and business leaders here fear that the local economy will suffer from the high interest rates needed to sustain the Hong Kong dollar's value.
"People now believe that the peg will indeed stay in place, and the price for that is high interest rates," said Clive McDonnell, senior economist for North Asia at Societe Generale Crosby Securities. But he added: "There is a weakness in the economy caused by slower external accounts. We have adjusted our G.D.P. growth for '98 from 5.7 percent to 4.8 percent." G.D.P., or gross domestic product, is a broad gauge of a nation's economic growth.
Others were a great deal gloomier. "If the peg is not broken, interest rates will have to rise and economic development in Hong Kong could come to a screeching halt," said Jeff Malakoff, a member of the treasury management team at Honeywell Inc., which has operations here.
At Morgan Stanley Asia, Andy Xie, an economist for the greater China region, was not discouraged by the market's volatility. "The worst may be over," he said. "I think that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is doing an outstanding job. The pressure on the currency will continue, but the worst has happened yesterday."
Still, he said, Hong Kong faces a painful period of readjustment. "The long-term outlook is that Hong Kong will go through some sort of restructuring process like other economies," he said. "Interest rates will remain higher than pre-crisis levels. But as the asset appreciation corrects, it will be good for Hong Kong."
On Des Voeux Road, however, concerns were immediate, and the potential benefits of this week's crisis were hard to see.
"I'm not very optimistic of the long-term development," said Ada Chan, who paused to look at a market monitor at the Star Internet Center. "I don't think there was anyone who didn't lose money. I think this is a good warning for small investors -- that they should be more cautious and not get caught up by all this."

Hong Kong Rebounds, But Not U.S. Stocks
Investors sent stocks sharply lower for a second day on Wall Street, despite a partial recovery in Hong Kong from the previous day's 10.4 percent drop. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 132.36 points, to 7,715.41, a drop of 1.7 percent atop Thursday's 2.3 percent fall. Many investors shifted into Treasury bonds, which rose for a second day. 
 After initially trading higher, stock markets were lower in Europe and elsewhere, too. Wall Street's gloomy reception to Hong Kong's rally could be bad news for Asia. Without the vote of confidence from America that Asia had been hoping for, the market turmoil that has been shaking the region for weeks, and that spread to Hong Kong and the rest of the world on Thursday, could resume. Page A1.
 
Thailand's political upheavals, an outgrowth of Southeast Asia's financial crisis, widened with the Prime Minister shuffling his Cabinet, naming a new finance minister and promising to hold early elections. A3.
 
President Supports China Ties
Even as investors focused on the problems in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong, President Clinton defended his policy of engagement with China as fundamental to America's economic and security interests, declaring the isolation of China to be "unworkable, counterproductive and potentially dangerous." The comments were meant to lay a foundation for next week's summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China. A6.
 
Boeing's Loss Exceeds Estimates
Boeing, struggling to keep up with the demand for its commercial airplanes, reported a big gain in revenue but suffered a larger-than-expected loss, largely because of a $1.6 billion pretax charge to cover production problems on the 747 and 737 jets. Boeing expects additional big write-offs before it fully recovers. D3.
 
School Internet Links Questioned
As volunteers in more than 40 states string up telephone wire and install computers with Internet access in schools today as part of the second annual Net Day, doubts are growing about the educational value of the public data network. Critics contend that the Internet is irrelevant for many American students who lack basic math and literacy skills. A1.
 
More Amtrak Uncertainty
The House of Representatives failed for a third day to take action that would provide new capital for Amtrak and amend labor rules in an effort to avert a strike at midnight next Tuesday. But legislation was introduced in the Senate to prevent a walkout, and agreements were reached to avoid possible disruptions to some commuter rail services. A9.
 
Panel Backs Aspirin Rival
An F.D.A. advisory panel gave its backing to Plavix, a new heart drug that its manufacturers -- Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi -- call superior to aspirin. But even if Plavix wins F.D.A. approval, it is unclear whether the drug can successfully compete with aspirin, a doctor-recommended and cheaper therapy for heart disease. D15.

A Federal judge extended Michael Milken's probation a sixth time while regulators consider whether the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond financier is obeying a court-ordered ban from the securities industry. D14.

HEADLINE: WALL STREET FAILS TO BUILD ON RALLY SEEN IN HONG KONG

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Hong Kong paved the way yesterday for a recovery from Thursday's global stock market rout, but Wall Street would not cooperate.
Apparently worried that the financial crisis in Southeast Asia could become worse before it becomes better, investors pounded the Dow Jones industrial average for the second consecutive day, dashing hopes that Hong Kong's rebound from its blackest trading day in eight years would spread to the United States. 
 Other major markets, which opened earlier than New York's exchanges, took their cue from Hong Kong. After stocks in the Chinese territory surged by nearly 7 percent, wiping out most of Thursday's 10 percent plunge, Japanese stocks bounced back and markets in Europe opened stronger. Hours later, when the Dow sprinted up almost 92 points in the morning, it seemed that Wall Street would join the euphoria.
But the American rally fizzled, and as stock prices moved lower, European markets fell with them. And the emerging markets in Latin America, the ones most vulnerable to the turmoil in Asia, fell even further, adding to their very sharp losses of Thursday. In the afternoon, the Dow's decline deepened, and it closed down 132.36 points, at 7,715.41. The Dow's drop over the last two days was the biggest since the end of March.
Wall Street's gloomy reception to Hong Kong's rally could be bad news for Asia. Without a vote of confidence from the United States, the market turmoil that has been roiling the region for weeks and spread to Hong Kong and the rest of the world on Thursday, could resume on Monday. Making matters worse, the political crisis in Thailand -- where the troubles began -- worsened yesterday. Page A3. And that boded ill for investors in Hong Kong, who were desperately trying to recoup some of their losses as the market turned back up. Page D1.
A further Asian decline might also mean that the United States and its allies, especially Japan, will be forced to take more decisive action to return calm to Asia.
"You haven't seen any statement out of the International Monetary Fund or the Treasury as yet that indicates that they see the situation as seriously as investors do," said Lawrence J. Brainard, global head of emerging-market research as Chase Securities. Thailand has already received a $17 billion rescue package from the I.M.F., but has been unable to carry it out because of all the market turbulence.
Uncertainty about the stock market's direction infected Wall Street just after the opening.
"I think its going to be very interesting how the U.S. responds today," Barton Biggs, global strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, said after the stock market opened yesterday morning. He quickly found out.
"It is fading fast," Mr. Biggs noted as the Dow began to give up its early gains. "I still think this is a big deal and an important event."
Two forces seemed to drive the American markets lower yesterday and take the steam out of the early rebound.
One was the fear among investors and analysts that although Hong Kong has managed, for now, to stem the tide of the financial crisis that has engulfed Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, they still have to consider the possibility that things can worsen. This is a big change in sentiment from just several days ago, when the assumption was that the Southeast Asian turmoil was a mere annoyance to the rest of the world and that Hong Kong, with its stronger corporate and financial underpinnings, was immune.
The second was that investors have begun to look more closely at the companies that might suffer if economic growth slows significantly in Asia, undercutting the demand for products made by American companies. Companies that have big stakes in Asia, including I.B.M., Coca-Cola and Texas Instruments, helped lead the market lower yesterday. Companies in the semiconductor business, like Applied Materials , which sells the machines to make the silicon wafers, also fell sharply as investors bet that the demand from Asia would decline.
What was worrying some people yesterday more than the American markets was Latin America. Just days ago, many analysts were confident that the spillover from Asia would not have a significant impact on Brazil, Mexico or Argentina, favorite territory for American investors.
Mr. Brainard of Chase Securities said he was worried the financial disturbances would spill over to those countries if Hong Kong could not defend its currency, which is pegged to the dollar. Those speculators, he said, are betting that the Hong Kong currency will have to fall just like the currencies of Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.
The defense of the Hong Kong dollar has meant a surge in interest rates to attract investors and make such speculation expensive. The increase in rates, in turn, pushed stocks lower because the increases undermine the earnings of the financial and property companies that are the backbone of the Hong Kong economy. Overnight interest rates were at 20 percent yesterday, well below the spike to 300 percent on Thursday but far above the recent 5 percent to 6 percent level.
Mr. Brainard said it "isn't likely" that Hong Kong will lose its currency battle. "But it is being seen more as a problem in the markets," he said. "And if the Hong Kong dollar peg goes, there is no way other regions escape." The most likely target for a similar attack in Latin America would be Brazil, he said.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that she thought the stock selling in the United States might be overdone. Investors, she said, are ignoring the positive implications of the Asian turmoil -- lower interest rates and less inflationary pressure as economic growth slows -- and are overestimating its impact on earnings.
For example, she said that American companies do more business in Mexico and Canada than in Asia and that a lot of the products sold there, like machinery for making computer chips, are needed by foreign chip makers to remain competitive. This means that sales will be less sensitive to an economic slowdown than investors think. So, she does not expect foreign-related earnings to go down. "They just won't go up as much," she said. "So the impact is less than expected."
Yesterday's drop in the Dow was equal to 1.7 percent, on top of Thursday's 2.3 percent slump. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 9.05 points, or 1 percent, to 941.64.
New York was not the only market to throw cold water on hopes for an end to the international financial crisis. Despite Hong Kong's resurgence, other East Asian markets slumped, with Singapore off 1.9 percent, Taiwan down 1.4 percent, Malaysia off 2 percent, Indonesia down 0.8 percent and Thailand off 3.4 percent.
In other regions, Brazil's stock market fell 3 percent and Mexico's 2.7 percent. Britain's main market index, which was up more than 100 points, or 2.2 percent, before Wall Street opened, finished down 21 points, or 0.4 percent.
Other financial markets were calmer yesterday. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 6/32 , to a price 101 13/32 , and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.27 percent, from 6.31 percent on Thursday. Much of the rally, as on Thursday, came from overseas investors seeking a haven for their investments.
The bond market also benefited from a growing belief among investors that the Federal Reserve, fearful of aggravating all the recent financial convulsions, will refrain from raising its short-term interest-rate target when its policy-making committee meets on Nov. 12.
The dollar rose modestly against the German mark and was unchanged against the Japanese yen. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7730 marks, up from 1.7682 late on Thursday. It also was steady at 121.87 yen.
Gold stocks suffered sharp losses yesterday, helping to pull the markets lower, after a Swiss Government panel recommended that the country leave the gold standard and sell off up to half of its gold reserves. The announcement could accelerate the trend among the world's central banks to sell their gold deposits because they do not earn anything and gold's recent price performance has been miserable.
The spot price of gold in New York fell $14.65 an ounce, or 4.5 percent, yesterday, to $309 an ounce. It was the lowest level since March 1985.

HEADLINE: Religion Journal;
Orthodox Patriarch Reaches Out to U.S. and the World

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
Almost since the moment his plane landed in the United States last Sunday, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual leader of the world's Eastern Orthodox Christians, has received a high measure of official acclaim.
In New York on Friday, he stood by as a portion of East 79th Street in Manhattan was named in his honor; the day before in Baltimore, that city's Mayor, Kurt Schmoke, paid him a tribute. And two days earlier, he received the highest honor of all, the Congressional Gold Medal. 
 Beyond the glitter and civic ceremonies, Patriarch Bartholomew's monthlong visit can be seen as primarily about two matters. On one hand, he is paying a pastoral call on Americans who belong to the Orthodox churches and archdioceses, of which the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America is the largest.
But the 57-year-old Patriarch is also showing he is determined to speak to a larger world, beyond the boundaries of Orthodox Christianity. Two years ago, he said that religious leaders needed "to take a visible place on the stage."
At a dinner given for him on Wednesday night by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the Patriarch said, "Part of our mission is to reach out beyond the borders of our faith tradition, as many of you reach out beyond the borders of your countries, in order to preach and to teach peace."
The Patriarch's status is a "first among equals" when it comes to the leaders of the self-governing Orthodox churches in Eastern Europe, Russia and the Middle East. But he also serves as Archbishop of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), and so plays a delicate and sometimes difficult role as leader of the tiny Christian minority in predominately Muslim Turkey. Since his enthronement in 1991, he has voiced a conviction that his patriarchate can act as a bridge for improving relations between Christians and Muslims.
But in Washington this week, the Patriarch worked to show an even broader range of concerns. During his visit to the United States Holocaust Museum on Monday, he called the Nazi genocide against Europe's Jews an "icon of evil," while saying that the museum itself was "an icon of human hope" -- significant statements, given the great importance the Orthodox place on icons as objects of religious teaching and faith.
At the museum, too, the Patriarch hailed the place of modern Israel in Jewish life: "We respect the role of Israel as a guarantor of the Jewish people's existence." And he described the Holocaust's victims as martyrs, whose memory should be eternal.
Later in the week, in a meeting with Vice President Al Gore, the Patriarch discussed his interest in environmental protection, a concern that has earned him the nickname "the Green Patriarch" in Europe. Next month, he will preside at a symposium on religion and the environment in Santa Barbara, Calif.
But it was during the dinner with Ms. Albright, and also in his remarks upon receiving the Congressional Gold Medal, that the Patriarch sought to spell out his vision of Orthodox Christianity as leading a spiritual renewal in Eastern Europe and perhaps elsewhere in the world.
To Ms. Albright, he said the Orthodox churches must play a key role, a spiritual one, in the reconstruction of Eastern Europe, after the collapse nearly a decade ago of Communist governments there.
"As Ecumenical Patriarch, we ask that you consider that working economies are only partial solutions," he said. "You, better than we, understand the onerous task of revitalizing economic infrastructures emaciated by failed social policies. But what of decimated cultures? What of religious institutions abused by secular powers for generations? How are we to rebuild the soul of a nation?"
"We must recognize that the spiritual needs of people are of equal importance to their material needs," he said.
In accepting the medal, the Patriarch said that although a fervent embrace of secular rationalism during the last two centuries had eroded "the spiritual bedrock of Western civilization," he believed that "the pendulum is swinging back" among many people, and that the Orthodox churches were gaining from this in converts.
"There is a great hunger for spirituality, there is a thirst for transcendent meaning," he said. "We believe that, as we enter the next millenium, religious values, religious feeling and religious faith are undergoing a massive revival."

HEADLINE: Taliban Agree to Enforce World Ban on Opium Trade

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The director of the United Nations anti-narcotics organization said today that the militant Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan had agreed to enforce a ban on opium poppy production and smuggling with the help of international crime-fighting organizations.
The official, Under Secretary General Pino Arlacchi, said in an interview that the agreement with the Taliban, who seized power in Kabul in September 1996, had taken six months to negotiate. 
 Only last month Mr. Arlacchi, an Italian expert on the Mafia who this year became executive director of the United Nations International Drug Control Program, described himself as "very worried" that poppy production had increased since the Taliban took power.
But today he described the new agreement as "a major breakthrough," doubly important because it comes as the next season's crop is about to be sown. "We are talking about half the heroin in the world," he said.
Mr. Arlacchi, who is in charge of all United Nations crime-fighting operations based in Vienna, said that a memorandum submitted to his office in Kabul from Afghanistan this week "opened the door to direct monitoring of the ban" for the first time. He said that he would go to Afghanistan next month to ask for permission to put a surveillance network into 42 districts where poppies are grown.
The United Nations, using the BBC's foreign language services, plans to begin broadcasts in Pushto next week telling farmers of the ban. International monitors should be able to know within a matter of months whether the Taliban have indeed begun to eliminate or reduce crops.
The drug-control agency has devised a program that would introduce new crops that could substitute for opium poppies, extend irrigation systems, build a few factories -- including a woolen mill already in planning -- and pay for police training and enforcement. The cost would be about $25 million a year over 5 to 10 years
Mr. Arlacchi is discussing the program with donor nations here and New York and will meet American officials next week in Washington.
United Nations officials have been struggling for a year to devise policies for dealing with the Taliban movement, with agencies quarreling over how much Afghanistan's new rulers should be isolated because of their harsh Islamic strictures, particularly their repression of women.
But Mr. Arlacchi said today that for his agency, this was a political question beyond its competence. "We are dealing with drugs," he said, "and Afghanistan is in the central position on our map."
He said that he was prepared to discuss human rights with the Taliban, but that he was also bearing in mind "the human rights of eight million drug addicts in the world."
In September Mr. Arlacchi said that opium production in Afghanistan had increased 25 percent, to 2,800 tons, in the year that the Taliban had controlled at least two-thirds of the country, including 96 percent of its poppy-growing areas. About half the world's heroin is derived from Afghan opium, with most of the rest coming from Southeast Asia and Colombia.
The Taliban movement banned the production and consumption of marijuana and its derivative hashish, as well as heroin, several months ago, but left the question of poppies clouded. A spokesman for the Taliban said today in New York that this was in part because Islamic law says nothing to prohibit poppy cultivation.
On the other hand, coffeehouses where hashish was available have been closed, Afghan and United Nations officials said. Drug use is punishable with a range of sentences including execution.
In New York, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's designated representative at the United Nations, where Afghanistan's seat is still held by the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, said that his Government's cooperation was linked to promises from Mr. Arlacchi's agency that there would be help in creating new jobs and crops for the farmers in areas where poppy cultivation exists.
Calling poppy cultivation "a very ugly legacy of Communist government in Afghanistan," Mr. Mujahid said poor farmers argued that they were growing poppies for medicinal use or because there was little else to cultivate profitably. They had to be persuaded to desist both theologically and economically, he suggested.
"There is nothing written that poppy cultivation is prohibited," Mr. Mujahid said, "But when changed to drugs, this is a great sin, a great crime to Islam. There is a saying of Mohammed that everything that is intoxication is prohibited in Islam. These things are not only harmful to Western population. This is also harmful to our own people."
The memorandum from the Taliban to Mr. Arlacchi's agency, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times, asks that heroin laboratories in neighboring Pakistan, where Afghan opium is refined, also be shut down.

HEADLINE: Clinton Defends Engagement With China

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Declaring the isolation of China to be "unworkable, counterproductive and potentially dangerous," President Clinton today defended his policy of engagement with China as fundamental to America's economic and security interests.
The President's 25-minute address to a small group of Asia experts at Voice of America headquarters here was broadcast to a global radio audience estimated at 100 million, and was meant to lay a foundation for next week's summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China. It was the first time in his Presidency that Mr. Clinton has devoted an entire speech to a broad treatment of the relationship between America and China. 
 He said that even though he is having a high-profile meeting with Mr. Jiang -- the first Chinese state visit in a dozen years -- significant problems remained between Washington and Beijing. China stifles dissent, supplies weapons components to rogue states and does not adhere to international trading regimes, the President said. But the relationship with China is too important to base solely on points of friction, he asserted.
"As always, America must be prepared to live and flourish in a world in which we are at odds with China," he said. "But that is not the world we want. Our objective is not containment and conflict; it is cooperation. We will far better serve our interests, and our principles, if we work with a China that shares that objective with us."
The President touched all the bases of China policy without lingering very long on any one -- human rights, trade, environmental protection, Chinese political liberalization and American security interests in Asia.
The audience of diplomats, China scholars and Government officials interrupted the President with polite applause only twice, when he made his most forceful statements on American determination to call attention to continuing human rights abuses in China.
Mr. Clinton sought to inoculate himself against critics who claim that the United States should not act so cooperatively toward a repeat violator of press and religious freedoms, but should rather use its political and economic muscle to press Beijing toward more openness.
The President spoke of the profound economic changes under way in China and predicted that the growth of a market economy would bring with it greater political freedom.
"In the process, however, they have stifled political dissent to a degree and in ways that we believe are fundamentally wrong," he said.
"This approach has caused problems within China and in its relationship to the United States," he continued. "Chinese leaders believe it is necessary to hold the nation together to keep it growing, to keep moving toward its destiny. But it will become increasingly difficult to maintain the closed political system in an ever more open economy and society."
Despite these differences, the President insisted, the United States could not afford to contain or isolate Beijing, nor could it succeed in doing so because such an approach would embolden the enemies of freedom in China and give European and Asian business competitors a jump on the world's largest emerging market.
"A pragmatic policy of engagement is the best way to advance our fundamental interests and values," the President said.
Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, criticized the President's speech as having glossed over Chinese human rights violations, however.
"President Clinton's China speech was masterful in its craftiness in whitewashing China's record," Ms. Pelosi said. "With this speech, President Clinton has tried to justify the failure of his trade policy and the failure of his human rights policy with a fiction of China's cooperation on proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
Although the President's Washington audience consisted chiefly of professional China experts, he aimed his message at listeners in China and across the United States.
Evelyn Lieberman, director of Voice of America, said the speech was being broadcast into China in Mandarin and would be rebroadcast over the next several days. Foreign radio broadcasts into China are sometimes jammed.
The President spelled out six reasons it is in American interests to work with China on a range of issues, and said they would figure in next week's summit agenda. He maintained that policing the unpredictable post-cold-war world would be much simpler with China as a partner, that the security of American allies and trading partners in Asia depended on China's peaceful role in resolving disputes there, and that global efforts to curb the spread of weapons of mass destruction would fail unless China agreed to stop selling dangerous technology to unreliable nations.
In addition, he said China could be a crucial partner in stemming the regional and global flow of drugs, arms and aliens; that China represented the richest potential market for American goods at a time when American economic growth depends on the growth of exports, and that China had a large role to play in efforts to reduce energy consumption and protect the environment.
He closed by approvingly quoting Richard M. Nixon, who as President brought about the historic modern opening of China to the West. Even in 1967, before winning the Presidency, he said, Mr. Nixon recognized the futility of trying to isolate the world's most populous nation, warning that "there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS;
In Final Round, Arguments Over Guns, Condoms and Cars

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from last night's debate among Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, State Senator James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, and Murray Sabrin, a Libertarian.
 
On AIDS and Condoms
 Should condoms be distributed in public schools? 
 SABRIN -- Here is a good example of how parental responsibility has been taken away from parents and put onto the schools. Parents are responsible for teaching their children values, to make sure that children have values that don't put them into situations where they have these problems. So what do we have to do in New Jersey? We have to have parents heavily involved in their children's education starting from day one. When that responsibility's not there, who takes over the burden? The burden should be placed, if you will, on the local communities.
McGREEVEY -- I do not think that schools should be distributing condoms. I do recognize, however, that there are significant non-educational problems that administrators and principals and teachers confront and there needs to be proper linkage between health departments and school. But part of this problem is also that we need to be going after behavioral change. We need to teach our students the different between right and wrong and that character counts. . . .
WHITMAN -- I believe that the decision to distribute condoms or not should be left up to the local school boards and the parents and teachers of our schools. We have a very comprehensive sex education that begins and ends with abstinence, because that is the only way to avoid an unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease. But we have to understand that there are kids that aren't going to get that message and to teach them everything else in between. But we need to work with the local districts to insure that we are providing that kind of education, which we do now. And we have a standard and a guide -- the first ever developed in this state -- for condoms in our classes.
 
On Auto Insurance
 Senator McGreevey is asked about the wisdom of his promise to roll back car insurance rates by 10 percent
McGREEVEY -- I'm going to do it. The insurance companies want to sue me. Make my day! My basic protection is that right now in the state of New Jersey, we spend $160 out of every $1,000 for fraud. Most states in the nation prosecute fraud; they don't pay for it. See the case in Essex County? Two unscrupulous health professionals bilked $52 million. They received a two-year suspension of license and a slap on the wrist. Frankly, if that happens during the McGreevey administration, they'll be prosecuted and, an individual, if indicted and convicted, ought to serve time. I believe New Jersey motorists should not be paying for fraud, and in addition, we need a public advocate to represent our interests. Right now, it's just the insurance companies and the Department of Insurance, and we've lost 12 times.
WHITMAN -- Well I'm always interested when the Senator speaks with such passion about going after fraud and talks about taking the professional licenses of those who engage in fraud. I agree. We wrote the bill. I signed it in June. He voted against it. We also went after the insurance companies. We have now increased the penalties to $25,000 each and every time they fail to report fraudulence. We've gotten rid of the most egregious benefits that insurance companies had under legislation that he sponsored. We're making a difference.
SABRIN -- I'll repeat what I said at the first debate. You can see that neither has the answer to the auto insurance mess in the state, which has been created over the past 20 years. Why aren't we trying freedom and deregulation? It works in every industry in the nation. Every country around the world is deregulated. What is this obsession with controlling the insurance industry? I don't understand it. It works in every other form of insurance -- homeowner's insurance, life insurance, people knocking on your door to get your business -- but not in auto insurance.
 
On Gun Control
SABRIN -- No, I would want the death penalty for someone who killed my family: that's the way I would feel. But we have the right to protect ourselves. That's a fundamental right; it's there in the Constitution; second amendment, the U.S. Constitution, and the New Jersey State Constitution. Protecting oneself is the most fundamental, natural activity that an individual can undertake. What we need is responsible gun ownership in this state. We can have instant-check that the National Rifle Association supports because that allows gun stores to determine who is eligible to get a gun if someone has a record. What we need, again, is personal responsibility. What does that mean? If you use a gun carelessly, you should be punished, civilly and criminally. It's very simple. Using a gun, a dangerous weapon, entails tremendous personal responsibility. And so what we need in this state is the right to carry it. . . .
McGREEVEY -- I supported and voted for the ban on assault weapons. I believe clearly that's where New Jersey ought to be. But it also draws a distinction between weapons that are illegal as opposed to weapons that are legal. We need to increase penalties -- punitive measures against those who illegally have arms, and draw that clear, strong distinction. It's not about punishing those who legally obtained through the permit process; it's about increasing penalties for those who illegally use arms.
WHITMAN I believe in the Second Amendment right to carry arms, but I also believe in, and I have signed legislation that increases the penalty for those who use illegal guns. And I must say, I'd be a little concerned living in a society where not only do we allow people to carry concealed guns, but we also make drug use legal. The combination is deadly.
 
On Big Government
 Mr. Sabrin was asked about his call to eliminate regulation and cut the size of state government.
SABRIN -- You ask the most important question in this election: What is the purpose of state government? I have gone to the State Constitution. The State Constitution says that we, the people, have the right to life, liberty and property. All the law emanating from the Legislature must be based on those premises. The government is micromanaging the auto insurance industry, giving us a $1 billion fee to protect our cars, and takes your car away next year if you don't pass inspection twice a year at a cost of $500. That's what's coming down the pike. We're talking about the government confiscating cars, overregulating land in our state, doing all the things that's costing our citizens millions and millions and millions of dollars. . . .
WHITMAN -- I think it's important to have as many voices as possible as part of this process and get as many people to vote as we possibly can. But those voices have to be responsible, and when Mr. Sabrin talks about us taking cars from people if they fail inspections next year, he is absolutely dead wrong. There's a real choice here: there's one person who believes in slash and burn of government and the other who believes in tax and spend. Then there is a third choice, and the third choice is someone who has a proven record of cutting taxes and controlling spending and seeing our economy rebound.
McGREEVEY -- I think the -- by the way, I like Murray -- I think the challenge here is making government work. On auto insurance, Governor Whitman's proposal is to reduce their coverage by 25 percent. Her own Republican Party refused that notion. This Republican Governor could get through $10 billion of debt, but didn't do anything on auto insurance reform for four years. And now the Governor recognizes it's a problem, after 12 rate increases and insurance companies' doubling their profits.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CHALLENGER;
City's Troubles Are Hidden, Messinger Says

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
In a direct challenge to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's portrayal of a city on the upswing, Ruth W. Messinger says that New York's schools, economy and budget are threatened by dangerous if unrecognized problems. She said she would devote her first months as Mayor to uncovering and explaining the depth of the city's woes.
The Democratic mayoral candidate, in a 90-minute discussion with editors and reporters from The New York Times on Thursday, said Mr. Giuliani had papered over the extent of the city's problems, both because of his interest in winning re-election and because he wanted to use this campaign to position himself for higher office. Ms. Messinger said that she, by contrast, was prepared to "break eggs" to address problems in the city's economy and schools, no matter what the political cost. 
 "What I will do as Mayor, and I certainly will do in the first six months, is identify what are the biggest problems, what are worst challenges facing the city," Ms. Messinger said. "Spell out the consequences of not addressing those problems. And if that's rough on people -- you know, I won't do it with a dour face, I won't do it with a projection of doom, but I'll say to people, 'We have big problems, they have been covered up and none of you benefit from that.' "
For example, she noted that despite national economic prosperity, the city had suffered under the weight of an unemployment rate verging on 10 percent, that the school system has been chronically overcrowded and underfinanced and that the budget was dangerously dependent on Wall Street's boom.
Ms. Messinger repeatedly criticized the Republican Mayor for what she described as an attempt to win re-election without telling New Yorkers what he would do in a second term. She noted that Mr. Giuliani had, during this campaign, delivered speeches in Washington and Boston, and suggested that his real agenda was auditioning for the national Republican Party. Indeed, Mr. Giuliani's aides have said that the Mayor is hoping to use a strong showing to enhance his political future.
Although Ms. Messinger repeatedly assailed the Mayor for not offering details of what a second Giuliani term might be like, she, too, was often vague in sketching out the details of a Messinger City Hall. Ms. Messinger said again she would order all schools to be kept open until 6 P.M., would sweep from office nearly all of Mr. Giuliani's commissioners and would attempt to address the city's chronic unemployment.
Beyond that, she said she could not offer many details of how or when she would deal with the problems she listed in her interview. And she put the blame for that on Mr. Giuliani, saying that City Hall's reluctance to provide budgetary and staffing numbers about the city made it impossible for her to present the kind of detailed agenda that might normally have been offered by this point.
"Very clearly, I can't do as much as I would like, and as much as I feel that you and the public is entitled to, to say, 'I've figured out we can do this by then,' " she said. "Because I can't get the numbers."
Ms. Messinger made her remarks in response to an invitation from The Times to discuss what she would do as Mayor. Mr. Giuliani has not responded to a similar invitation.
Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager, Fran Reiter, said in response that Ms. Messinger was painting an unfairly bleak portrait of the Mayor and the city. "She's become the official scold of New York," Ms. Reiter said. "This campaign has been for six months negative on two fronts: negative in terms of what she has to say about her opponent -- that's been nonstop -- and being the purveyor of doom and gloom."
Through the interview, Ms. Messinger was earnest, though restrained. She discussed the city's problems in detail, employing the often technocratic language of someone who has been government for 20 years, which she has.
The interview was conducted after several opinion polls, including one in The Times, showed her trailing the Mayor by a sizable -- and possibly insurmountable -- margin. Ms. Messinger did not discuss her political standing, though at several points she seemed close to describing the election as something of a closed book.
In suggesting that Mr. Giuliani was playing to audiences outside this city, Ms. Messinger seemed to be reflecting the consensus in political circles that the Mayor was trying to use this campaign to position himself in national Republican politics.
She said Mr. Giuliani's "lack of vision, lack of plans," had hurt the typical New York City voter who, Ms. Messinger said, "suffers from a Mayor who seeks re-election and could win re-election without having told anybody what it is he is going to do in his second term. And with everybody in the city having reason to believe that what he will be most interested in his second term -- what some of us would say he's been most interested in his first term -- is himself and where it is he's going and when it is he's going to go there. "
Ms. Messinger devoted as much of her interview to discussing what she described as Mr. Giuliani's shortcomings and the problems facing him as she did her own plan. On specific matters, she criticized him for failing to sign legislation that would create an independent civilian board to review allegations of police abuse. She said he should add $2 million to the budgets of the city's soup kitchens. She bemoaned the condition of the services for children, but did not say what she might do differently.
Ms. Messinger said that Mr. Giuliani had gambled too much of the city's well-being on the success of Wall Street, which she said would inevitably end. "What on earth is this Mayor's plan for then?" she asked. "The Mayor is in a peak moment in the city's economy. He is tolerating a 9.3 percent unemployment rate and says it isn't a problem. And he says that what's happening in our schools is not a problem."
Ms. Messinger said she was prepared to deal with any potential economic downturn with cuts in spending -- she said again she would not raise taxes -- though she did not offer examples of how. "Am I prepared to look for cuts? Yes. Do I know the ins and outs of his budget, you know, better than many? Yes."
Mostly, though, she assailed Mr. Giuliani's personality. She described him as a "tough cowboy" who used the "Big Lie" technique to get his way. "I think the nasty, bully parts of his personality are devastatingly bad for this city," she said. "I think they have missed hundreds of opportunities to bring people together."
Asked how a typical family suffered because of Mr. Giuliani's personality, Ms. Messinger responded: "Under Rudy Giuliani, that family has missed lots of opportunities to negotiate out solutions that would be better for them in terms of state aid to education, to be fairly dramatic and direct. In terms of making the labor force more efficient and having a contract that begins to make the changes from which all future mayors will benefit.
"Because, in fact, telling everybody in the city that the way to get your way is to be a tough, mean, nasty person is quite dangerous for the model that I think works for the city. Do you need tough? Yes. Do you need mean? No."

Small Steps in Thai Crisis
As the people of Thailand called for his resignation, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh shuffled his Cabinet and named a Finance Minister to replace the one that quit last week. Thailand is at the epicenter of a financial crisis that has shocked Asia with currency devaluations and harrowing declines in stock markets. With consumer prices rising and tens of thousands of jobs being lost, the press has taken to calling Mr. Chavalit a "madman" for focusing on fractious political infighting rather than confronting the crisis.

HEADLINE: Child Welfare Agency Needs More Workers;
Try Higher Salaries

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is horrifying to read about children who have been abused or even murdered by family members while supposedly being monitored by New York City's child welfare agency (front page, Oct. 22). However, I think that the agency is being asked to do an almost impossible job. 
 Things have changed little since 1979, when I was a graduate student in social work doing my field placement in a foster care agency under contract with the city. The paid staff and I were asked to make visits to families in the most economically depressed areas of the city. These visits were terrifying; the worker is sent alone into frightening apartment buildings with broken elevators, forced to walk up dark stairwells and to enter apartments in which there is no way of knowing what one will face.
When I was a social-work student, many of the caseworkers were not long out of college, as still seems to be the case. They were paid low salaries and were overwhelmed by the tasks they were asked to perform. Needless to say, there was a great deal of staff turnover. If we as a society claim to care so much about our most vulnerable children, are we willing to put our money where our mouths are?

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS;
Excerpts From Interview With Democratic Mayoral Candidate

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with Ruth W. Messinger conducted on Thursday by editors and reporters from The New York Times.
Q. Could you talk about, as specifically as you can, what the first six months of a Messinger administration would be like? What would you start to try to do, area by area? How would New York be different? 
 MESSINGER -- First of all, the appointments will be very different. I think that the city is in desperate need of skilled, knowledgeable commissioners in different agencies, at least some of them. I will put together an administration that pays real attention to how we do some of the things that I talked about in the speech this summer, how we modernize city government, how we address what it is that the work force in this city is doing for the city. You can't do every one of those agencies at once. But you can look for people who really have some demonstrated experience in my judgment. Some of those people, and I'm not saying at this moment, I know them by name, are in the next two echelons of some of those agencies.
Q. You know what steps you would like to take to improve the city's public schools. As mayor, wouldn't it be frustrating if the school system's bureaucracy and the community school boards blocked your ideas?
A. I don't envision that happening. Tough people don't survive 22 years in the government of this city without being tough. Tough people know how to get something done. I've got a whole bunch of things done as Borough President that people said I couldn't get done. I want to be mayor because I know there are some things that need doing. Several people have said to me, well, it would be easy for him Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to do the Police Department because of its hierarchical nature. Maybe that's true but I watched him take a fair amount of head banging to make some changes in the Police Department, much of it done by Bill Bratton. I can certainly look at the Police Department and see what they haven't yet done. They decided to leave substantial sinecures that are untouched. There are still many police officers working behind desks. There are still too many police officers in One Police Plaza. What changes are needed? And if you decide that, if you have a vision, which I do, if you really believe that it's worth everything, it's worth a second time to start turning the schools of this city around.
Q. How would you deal with principal tenure, the legal provision giving lifetime job security to most principals in New York City?
A. Challenge it in Albany. I would increase the authorities that principals have in their buildings. I think you cannot in fact hold a principal responsible for what happens in I.S. 172 if he does not have a set of discretionary money, if to some extent the custodian is still out of control, and if the school security people belong to someone else. Then you can comment all the time on what's wrong in the schools -- but you can't really in a legitimate way say, O.K., you failed. So it is a combination of saying here are the additional areas in which we are going to give you authority but as we move in those directions and change some of those regulations, then we're going to move to a four-year contract system.
Q. Would you tell us what policies you would use to curb child abuse? Would you comment on the level of child abuse and government's seeming inability to do anything? How would you balance the privacy of the family with the welfare of children? Would you take more children away, more foster care, more preventive care the way Mayor Dinkins tried? Do you throw in the towel?
A. No, we don't want to throw in the towel. I've been talking about it since I came into government because among the 6,000 things that elected officials become immediate experts on, this is work I've done. I have evaluated children whose parents were accused of abuse, of neglect. I've made decisions about moving kids from their homes. I've found foster and adopted homes. I've done it all.
First of all, it never has gone away. It never will go away. There will always be homes that are so severely dysfunctional for whatever set of reasons, exacerbated by economics but sometimes, as you know, entirely independent of economics, where children are the victims of physical or emotional neglect or serious abuse and brutality. It's very hard for people to wrap their brains around that and accept it. But can you run a very different child welfare agency than this city has been running under four names? That's how I decided that I'd been around so long -- the agency got its fourth name without any improvements. And the answer is yes.
Q. Which policies would you pursue?
A. First of all, let me just make a comment on the preventive stuff. We need to do a lot of preventive care and services. I believe that every kid in this city should have a place to go to from 3 to 6 P.M.
Q. Do you believe in family preservation?
A. Wait, let's take this one piece at a time.
Invest in preventive care, but do not imagine that if you provide more preventive care the number of cases of reported possible abuse or neglect will go down. You are not going to sort of save people by putting more kids in after-school care and you are probably going to run into some families -- good quality person in a beacon school, actually seeing a kid after school, seeing adults -- probably going to find some more instances of kids who are at risk that might have otherwise have escaped the system until something blew up in their faces.
Some family preservation, yes. You do some of it. One of the things that needs to be done in this city and this is by the way true in large numbers of agencies, is to get permission, which means negotiation with City Council, State Legislature and with unions, to try some very different approaches in some parts of the city. One of the really bad things about so-called agendas for reforms, whether it's Nick Scoppetta in child welfare or whomever you might in any agency is, O.K. we're going to do this this year. And all of a sudden we have a plan for doing it. Five boroughs, 400 neighborhoods, with a potential population of 8 million. That's where you run into every single logjam. I would take probably two districts and say let's figure out what happens if you do child welfare coterminous with the school district. . . .

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transcription error, excerpts on Saturday from an interview with Ruth W. Messinger on what she would do if elected mayor misstated part of a quotation. Her comment was: "What changes are needed? And if you decide that, if you have a vision, which I do, if you really believe that it's worth everything, it's worth a second term to start turning the schools of this city around." She did not say "worth a second time."

HEADLINE: John Kennedy Jr., One Step Ahead of the Pack, Quietly Travels to Cuba

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
John F. Kennedy Jr., the editor of George magazine, has quietly traveled to Cuba on the 35th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, in which his father, the President, faced down the Soviet Premier, Nikita S. Khrushchev, in a nuclear confrontation. But the purpose of his visit was a mystery yesterday.
"He is there as a journalist," Nancy Haberman, a spokeswoman for George, said, insisting that she had no other details. Others close to Mr. Kennedy, including his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., declined to talk about the visit or its significance. United States and Cuban officials also said they had no information. 
 It was thus unclear whether Mr. Kennedy went on his own or at the behest of Cuba's Government, whether an interview with President Fidel Castro had been arranged, or even whether the trip was intended to provide a scoop for George or to convey a larger significance on the anniversary of the crisis that had threatened nuclear war.
On Oct. 22, 1962, President Kennedy disclosed that the Soviet Union, trying to tip the strategic balance of power, had built nuclear missile bases in Cuba that could strike anywhere in the Americas. He ordered a naval blockade of Cuba and urged Khrushchev to recall the weapons and dismantle the bases.
Six days later, Khrushchev backed down, ordering ships carrying warheads to Cuba to turn back and agreeing to destroy the launch sites in return for a United States pledge of nonintervention in Cuban affairs. Soon afterward, Washington imposed an economic embargo against Cuba that still exists.
In Havana yesterday, journalists said Mr. Kennedy, accompanied by an aide, had arrived on Thursday and checked into the luxury Melia-Cohiba Hotel overlooking the Havana waterfront. After breakfast yesterday, he left by a back door and eluded reporters and photographers. There were unconfirmed reports that he had gone to Trinidad, on the south-central coast, with Cuban officials. Another report said he planned to leave Cuba today.
There was wide speculation that Mr. Kennedy had gone for an interview with Mr. Castro -- one that might mingle reflections on the missile crisis, an oft-expressed admiration for President Kennedy, as well as issues like human rights, Cuba's limited economic liberalization and the eventual succession of Mr. Castro's brother, Raul.
An interview with Mr. Castro could be a coup for George, founded by Mr. Kennedy in 1995 with a focus on political commentary. Mr. Kennedy, the editor in chief, does many of George's interviews.
Interviews with Mr. Castro are rare, but he spoke last year with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Michael Kennedy, sons of Robert F. Kennedy. They had been invited to Cuba with a group of environmental safety advocates; Mr. Castro at the time reflected on the missile crisis, the Bay of Pigs invasion and President Kennedy's assassination.

THE PLATYPUS
 AND THE MERMAID
 And Other Figments
 of the Classifying Imagination.
 By Harriet Ritvo.
 Illustrated. 288 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $29.95. 
 Thomas Bewick's "General History of Quadrupeds" was published in 1824, in an era when naturalists prided themselves on offering a far more systematic classification of the animal kingdom than their pre-Enlightenment predecessors had done. However, as Harriet Ritvo points out in this engaging, offbeat book, Bewick's history continued to exhibit some deeply traditional principles of organization. His entry on the cat, for example, began with the disclaimer that "to describe an animal so well known, might seem a superfluous task," before going on "to discuss its eyesight, its voice, its irritability, its gestation, its lack of affection for humans, its price in medieval Wales and its relationship to Dick Whittington."
Animals, like any other objects of knowledge, can be classified in various ways, depending on which characteristics are considered salient or defining. Though it may be hard for the modern reader to recognize it as such, Bewick's book is in principle one intelligible ordering of relevant information. By the early 19th century, it had in fact long been superseded among professional zoologists by other kinds of classification, in which certain fundamental anatomical features were used to determine which species any particular beast should be assigned to. But such a coolly clinical procedure did not necessarily satisfy all the needs that might be in play in understanding a particular creature's place in the scale of creation.
In 1829 the naturalist Edward Bennett denied that the domestic dog should be considered part of the same species as the wolf and other wild canines, but he had to acknowledge that its distinctiveness could not be maintained on grounds of physical characteristics: rather, he declared, "it is to the moral and intellectual qualities of the dog that we must look for those remarkable peculiarities which distinguish him."
The fact that neither Bewick nor Bennett was at what we might call the cutting edge of scientific taxonomy in their day is part of what recommends them to Ritvo's attention. For "The Platypus and the Mermaid" is a study of a wide range of classificatory practices in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Ritvo is particularly interested in the interplay between learned and popular writing. Hers is, therefore, far from a triumphalist, march-of-science narrative about how the 18th-century Linnaean system was displaced in the early 19th century by Cuvier's work in comparative anatomy, which was in turn challenged by the Darwinian denial of the fixity of species. Instead, she has assembled a collection of assumptions about the natural world, ranging from attempts at comprehensive zoological classification through a more demotic fascination with hybrids, crossbreeding, and "monsters," and on to the categories involved in those two very unscientific forms of relation to animals -- hunting them and eating them.
She begins with the first reports of the exotic fauna of Australia at the end of the 18th century because these creatures, especially the platypus and the kangaroo, were not only unfamiliar but actually threw doubt on the received principles of Linnaean classification; there was even some initial anxiety that the platypus might have been a naturalist's hoax, a duck's head having been grafted onto the body of a quadruped. But, as Ritvo hastens to point out, deciding what to do with this furry, wide-billed anomaly was only one of the more obvious puzzles that plagued all attempts to arrange a neat table of stable and distinct species.
Moreover, although the use of binomial Latin terms may have helped to give the impression of impersonal systematic order (as well as insuring that the naming of new species remained the province of the educated), there were often more directly practical interests at stake for various social groups, professional zoologists included. After all, what the "species" is to the laboratory, the "breed" is to the barnyard: stockbreeders had a major economic interest in operating with agreed categories that kept out any taint of the mongrel or the hybrid. And Ritvo is unfailingly alert to the yet more diffuse cultural resonances of the relation of man to beast. For example, being great meat-eaters was a defining characteristic of English identity in the 19th century, but there was meat and meat. It was taken as a further sign of the depravity of the French that they were proudly "hippophagique" ("they eat horses, don't they?"). And, of course, the English didn't eat dogs either, on the self-evident and therefore never stated social principle that one doesn't do that sort of thing to friends.
To prepare oneself for writing such a book as this, one has to have cultivated a long familiarity with works not usually regarded as being among the classics of the Western tradition, such as "Beeton's Book of Home Pets: Showing How to Rear and Manage, in Sickness and in Health, Birds, Poultry, Pigeons, Rabbits, Guinea Pigs, Dogs, Cats, Squirrels, Fancy Mice, Tortoises, Bees, Silkworms, Ponies, Donkeys, Goats, Inhabitants of the Aquarium, Etc." of the early 1800's or, later in the century, James Long's more succinctly titled "Book of the Pig." In her treatment of this arcana, Ritvo sustains a lightly sardonic note without ever ridiculing her sources, and the pleasures of her deft prose are supplemented by some tellingly bizarre illustrations. Judged by these characteristics, "The Platypus and the Mermaid" clearly belongs to a subset within the genus "scholarly monograph," perhaps even to a distinct species marked by its adaptation to a nonacademic environment (Opus Academicus Accessibilis). Readers worried about the debilitating effects of hybridity may be reassured by its impeccable pedigree: its author is a professor of history at M.I.T. who has already published widely on the interplay between scientific and popular understandings of the natural world in 19th-century Britain. (I wouldn't be surprised if she were a pet lover, too.)
The book's serious intellectual ambitions are less obvious than its surface charms. Ritvo offers no conclusions and for the most part she abstains from directive comment or even explicit argument. She seems to take quiet pleasure in the anomalies and instabilities that constantly manifest themselves in all schemes of classification, and of course in large parts of American academic culture today anything that can be said to "destabilize" categories is assumed to be a good thing.
The very few places at which she allows herself anything approaching a general claim raise more questions about the rationale for her enterprise than they settle. For instance, she writes, "The sea serpent, like the unicorn and especially the mermaid, embodied alternative modes of understanding the natural world," modes that signaled people's "reluctance to accept the structures imposed by self-constituted expertise." "Imposed" suggests she is unmasking the coerciveness that sustains scientific authority, and a similar frisson of ever-so-slightly-pleased-with-itself heterodoxy is present in the implication that a belief in unicorns and mermaids should be seen as one among other possible "modes of understanding the natural world."
And this takes us back to her title. It is clearly designed to be eye-catching (a characteristic that has perhaps been crossbred from the Opus Commercialis), and its juxtaposition of "platypus" with "mermaid" is presumably intended to be in some sense transgressive. Both, it implies, threw sizable monkey wrenches into the works of the taxonomies then dominant, suggesting that we should regard them as equally revealing of the limits, and hence limitations, of various worlds of discourse, including that which prided itself on being most "scientific." Yet the fact remains that platypuses, however troubling to Linnaean classification they initially seemed, were soon accounted for and assimilated into the accredited body of scientific knowledge. I have enjoyed Ritvo's entertaining and informative tour of both the highroads and the hedgerows of natural history, but should I regard myself as missing (or even resisting) her main point if I persist in thinking that only one of the two creatures in her title was a figment of anyone's imagination?

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Las Vegas on a Small Stake

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
WHILE waiting for my suitcase at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, I got to talking with three little old ladies from Long Island.
"I make out good at blackjack," said the first. 
 "I like slot poker," said the second.
"I'm here to watch the idiots," said the third.
It was after midnight on a Tuesday in September. Our plane from New York (not-so-lucky TWA Flight 777) had left two hours late, and it took 30 minutes for the luggage to arrive. Meanwhile, right there in the baggage claim area, quarter slot machines were binging and bonging -- sounds that do insidious things to the nervous system.
Briefly, I wondered what I was doing in Las Vegas, renowned for tackiness, vice, hangovers and more recently family-style casinos. The vaunted neon makes me mourn the damming of the Colorado River, and my idea of a good time at gambling tables is playing with someone else's money.
But last spring on a driving tour through the Southwest, I veered off the highway to try the $9.95 buffet at the MGM Grand Hotel. A friendly couple from New Jersey told me it would be a sin to leave town without a stroll up the Strip. So off we went, taking in the Statue of Liberty at New York-New York, a volcano erupting at the Mirage and a pirate ship under siege outside Treasure Island -- an amazing number of sights for such a short hike. I wanted to go back.
I doubted that I'd gamble much. As everyone knows, the odds are stacked in favor of the house. That's how casinos make money, luring crowds with spectacles, free drinks, budget buffets and cheap rooms.
Prices have risen lately, driven by economic prosperity and a building boom that brought the oasis in the Nevada desert huge, new luxury hotels like the MGM Grand, Mirage, Luxor and New York-New York (with two new properties, the Venetian and the Bellagio, due to open in the next two years). But according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the average tourist who is in the city for two nights budgets over $500 for gambling, and only about $230 for accommodations. On a slow week, competition to fill the city's 103,000 hotel rooms remains heated, with prices at top-of-the-line places like the Mirage and Caesars Palace dropping from highs in the hundreds to lows of $59 to $69. Farther north on the Strip, the rate at the Sahara sometimes dips to $28.
These hotels are no fleabags. Many have spectacularly kitschy decorations, vast palm-fringed swimming pools, spas, shopping arcades, jousting tournaments, rare-animal collections and sound-and-light shows ( the one at Caesars Palace simulates the destruction of the island of Atlantis).
I have always wanted to see Atlantis, and love hotel rooms in all their unpredictable variety. So I bet that I could spend four nights in Las Vegas, including air fare, meals and accommodations, for about the same amount the average person drops at the gambling tables in two nights.
I started by checking packages organized by airlines and travel agencies, which run ads in newspapers for astoundingly low-priced Las Vegas sprees. Liberty Travel, for example, offered a deal that included round-trip air fare from New York, two nights at Palace Station and a discount-coupon booklet for $255 a person, double occupancy. Alas, I quickly found that the low-end deals last for just two nights and involve taking night flights -- meaning that on the first day, you arrive in Las Vegas late, and leave late on the third day after checking out of your hotel around noon. If you're traveling alone, the single supplement inflates the price by about a third.
So I put together my own package by hunting down an economy fare of $264 round trip from TWA, with night flights both ways. On the day I was scheduled to return to New York, I decided to stand by for a morning flight -- which is how I got home in time for dinner, at no extra charge.
Then I set about monitoring hotel rates, which fluctuate dramatically depending on demand. Once a week in late August and early September, I checked the price of the cheapest available room at nine hotels, including Treasure Island -- where, over the phone, the price ranged from $179 to $199 to $79, before bottoming at $49 while I was standing at the check-in counter. Admittedly, few travelers want to wait until the last minute to book accommodations. But price swings are a factor to consider when assessing packages, and the next time I pass through Las Vegas, I'm going to check the rate at Caesars Palace before bedding down in a Motel 6.
If I'd spent as much time learning basic blackjack strategy as I did tracking hotel rates, maybe I'd be a rich woman now. Still, the rate checking was worth it because I got a $28 room for my first night at the Sahara, which opened in 1952 on what is now the north end of the Strip. The next day I moved into a $30 room at Binion's Horseshoe on the Fremont Street mall downtown. For Day 3, I got a $69 room at the Mirage, on the central section of the Strip, with Treasure Island and Caesars Palace next door. On my last night, I stayed in a $59 room at the Monte Carlo, which opened in 1996 and has one of the most celebrated swimming-pool areas in town.
The rates were low because I avoided the weekend, and there was nothing much doing in town besides a moderate-size convention of the American Chemical Society, Wayne Newton in concert and a crop of expensive floor shows.
To economize, I decided not to see a show or rent a car -- even though Las Vegas is hardly a pedestrian-friendly town, with construction sites swallowing up sidewalks, sizzling hot pavement, heavy traffic and considerable distances between attractions. From the Sahara, it's over three miles to the Luxor and about the same distance to Fremont Street downtown. But a monorail connects the MGM Grand to Bally's, and a free tram runs between Treasure Island and the Mirage. For the most part, I relied on public buses ($1.30), tourist trolleys ($1.50) and taxis.
AT 1 A.M. it was a quick trip in a shuttle ($3.50) from the airport to the Sahara, which has recently been renovated but still looked vaguely grungy in the lurid glare of the slots. New carpeting lined the hall on the sixth floor of the Tunis Tower, though only one room along the corridor had new molding. My key card fit the lock there, and the room turned out to be a freshly decorated suite, somewhat Southwestern in style, with a bar, king bed, sitting area, two baths and bank of windows overlooking a parking garage. Maybe I got it for $28 because I was staying for only a night; maybe I was just lucky. Or maybe the weary, winsome approach I've been trying to cultivate with front-desk clerks finally paid off.
When I awoke the next morning, Las Vegas seemed like a top-notch place. The Sahara's domes, peaked windows, fake palms and colonnades evoked a cleaner, brighter Marrakesh than the one I visited last winter, and the large, lovely pool was shaded by a huge minaret. There was a heaping plate of lox with the bagels at the $2.99 breakfast buffet in the Sultan Room, and the casino offered free gambling lessons -- which is how I learned when to split a hand in blackjack, and that only suckers bet on the Big 6 and 8 at craps.
Across the street from the Sahara is an empty lot where the Strip's first hotel casino, the El Rancho, opened in 1941. Since then most of the action has moved south, with the exceptions of Circus-Circus, where I watched the free trapeze show above the gaming tables, and the Stratosphere, with a 1,149-foot tower surmounted by a roller coaster. It costs $6 to take the elevator to the top, but the view of the valley -- scouted by Jedediah Smith in 1826, crossed by the railroad in 1905 and put on the map by mobsters and movie stars after Nevada legalized casino gambling in 1931 -- is worth it. Carole Lombard died in a plane crash in the bone-dry Spring Mountains to the southwest, and across the valley Nellis Air Force Base stretches, home to the Stealth Fighter.
I arrived at Binion's Horseshoe (by taxi for about $8) in time to take a hot jog among the plasma centers north of downtown, followed by a dip in the hotel's rooftop pool, which was small but pleasant. So was my room on the second floor above the casino. It was decorated country-style, nicer than I'd expected, with drapes that matched the spread, a window air-conditioner, and a TV with an in-house channel for playing keno in bed.
The casino downstairs has western decor, a buffet and coffee shop. I was sad to learn that Binion's famous $2 steak dinner had been discontinued. So I bought myself a scotch and soda for $1.25 and sidled up to a craps table, where the action was so heated that the shooter's cigarette had burned down to the filter, unheeded, and the man next to me blithely told his buddy that he'd lost $1,300. When I asked an idle stickman if the Horseshoe gave lessons, he sneered at me. Clearly, this was no place for a greenhorn.
Pretty soon the neon signs of downtown blinked on, and even I was impressed to find the entire facade of Binion's decked in twinkling baby blue. Outside the hotel's front door lay the Fremont Street pedestrian mall, covered by a four-block-long canopy studded with 2.1 million bulbs, illuminated several times nightly during a free sound-and-light show called the "Fremont Street Experience." Down the block, the Golden Nugget was sponsoring performances by the Doveiko Aerialists from the Moscow Circus, and I stopped at the Golden Gate, Las Vegas's oldest hotel (dating from 1906), for a surprisingly big 99-cent shrimp cocktail. There was so much to see and do that I didn't get around to supper until 10. I've had better prime rib dinners than the one I ate in the coffee shop at the Lady Luck, about a block north of Freemont Street -- but never for $5.49.
The next morning I caught a crowded public bus down the Strip, taking a seat next to a lady from Texas who described what it felt like to win $25,000 at the slots. As I got off she wished me luck.
The Mirage was a tropical dream of a hotel with an aquarium behind the check-in counter, lush gardens in the center of the casino, an astonishing amoeba-shaped pool agitated by a waterfall and one of the more palatial rooms I've ever occupied. There I found two partly canopied double beds, a luxurious bath, a wide window with a view of the volcano, and my brother, John, who lives in Los Angeles. We'd planned to meet in Las Vegas before heading off for a weekend of camping in southern Utah.
While he snoozed by the pool, I toured the Secret Garden of Siegfried & Roy ($10), where the two magicians who headline at the Mirage keep the rare white tigers and lions they use in their act. After that, I strolled over to the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace to watch fire and water consume Atlantis and a statue of Bacchus come to life.
JOHN and I went back downtown for dinner, to glut ourselves at the popular $8.99 buffet at Main Street Station, which was better than any of the others I tried. After a while, though, all the buffets taste the same. And even the nicest hotel rooms lack distinguishing features. The one I moved to at the Monte Carlo the next day had two double beds, a TV, big bath and desert view, as did my brother's room next door. But because he arrived at the reception desk at just the right moment, his cost only $49, instead of the $59 I paid for mine.
We preferred the Mirage's swimming area to the pools at the Monte Carlo, which are noisy, crowded and a little like a water park. I was distressed to learn that even hotel guests have to pay $20 a day to use the Monte Carlo's well-equipped spa (since reduced to $14). But I liked the buffet ($6.49 at lunch, $8.49 at dinner), and the location: close to Hollywood (at the MGM Grand), Manhattan (at New York-New York), Camelot (at the Excalibur) and ancient Egypt (at the Luxor).
We saw it all, while John gambled and I equivocated. Finally, he thrust a dollar onto a table at a Big 6 wheel and told me to pick a number. Big 6 is an old carnival game, and a dumb way to try to make money. Just to be contrary, I chose the number with the toughest odds -- 40 to 1. The wheel went round, slowed, and then stopped on my number. So I went away with $40 extra in my wallet. Next time in Las Vegas, I think I'll do a little gambling.
 
The bottom line
My four-night Las Vegas trip cost $595, including round-trip air fare from Kennedy Airport on TWA, (800) 221-2000, accommodations, meals and admission fees. The average room cost $51 a night.
Most major car-rental chains have offices at McCarran International Airport. When I checked in September, a local firm, Savmor, (800) 634-6779 or (702) 736-1234, had economy cars for $149 a week, or $21 a day.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Jamaica, Queens;
F.D.A. Project Taps Unusual Public-Private Alliance

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
WHEN it is completed in the fall of 1999, the new laboratory and office building for the Food and Drug Administration will look much like the others on the campus of York College in Jamaica, Queens.
The red brick and glass exterior will give no hints of the coalition of city, state and Federal agencies plus private companies that had to be forged to make the 260,000-square-foot, $85 million project a reality after years of studies and failed plans. Ground was broken on Oct. 14 in a temporary parking lot at the northeast corner of Liberty Avenue and 158th Street. 
 A state agency, the Dormitory Authority, controls the land under the building, which will be leased to a private developer, Hines Interests L.P. Private capital has been raised to finance construction of the combined building, a three-story laboratory and a five-story office building that will be connected by a glass atrium. But for tax reasons the building will be owned by a state agency, once again the Dormitory Authority.
Hines will develop the project and manage it for at least 20 years, with a Federal agency, the General Services Administration, paying the rent.
Officials involved say the reason it took most of 1990's to put the deal together was the unusual involvement of multiple government agencies, private companies like Hines and quasi-private organizations like the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, which helped win community and political support for the project and is a very minor investor in it.
"This was not a typical government construction project," said Donal E. Farley, a retired senior vice chancellor of the City University who acts as a consultant on real estate matters. "You had a lot of agencies, the private sector, a very complicated deal -- and everybody had a lawyer."
He said that because of the unusual nature of the undertaking, the lawyers spent a lot of time trying to anticipate possible problems. "There were a lot of 'what-ifs' that were raised," Mr. Farley said. " 'What if somebody goes bankrupt? Who gets the property?' Finally enough pressure was applied and the issues got settled."
One reason for the unusual alliance was to take advantage of private developers' proven ability to bring in projects on time and within budget, said F. Carlisle Towery, president of Greater Jamaica Development. He said delays in the construction and finishing of the federally owned building in Jamaica that houses offices of Social Security and other agencies had left local officials skeptical about all-government projects.
"The Federal building took nine years to build when it should have taken three," he said. Greater Jamaica helped push the F.D.A. project, which will bring about 350 jobs to the area, although at least at first, most will not be held by local residents.
"I have 27 months to finish the project and the clock started running in August," said Peter J. Davoren, vice president and general manager of the New York office of the Turner Construction Company, the general contractor. "At the end of that time, I have to have an operating building."
He said the project was being built on a so-called fast-track basis, which means construction starts before all the design drawings and specifications have been completed. Since a developer has to borrow to pay for construction and gets no rent until the building is occupied, the faster a construction company can work, the more likely it will be chosen to do the work.
The F.D.A.'s current location in the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn is a throwback to the early years of the century, when most of the food, drugs and other materials falling under its jurisdiction came in by ship. Being close to the waterfront made it convenient to collect samples for analysis in the agency's laboratories.
TODAY the Brooklyn waterfront is largely deserted and most of the items that require the agency's attention come in by air to Kennedy International Airport. With many of the F.D.A.'s workers living on Long Island, the Jamaica location will be much more convenient than Brooklyn, since a major terminal of the Long Island Rail Road is only a few blocks away, Mr. Towery said.
In addition, a light rail line along the median of the Van Wyck Expressway to the airport -- which is not fully authorized but is widely anticipated -- should make it easier for F.D.A. employees to travel from the Jamaica office to a branch at Kennedy.
Because F.D.A. officials said they would like their new location to be on or near a college campus, Greater Jamaica made a deal with York to set aside the land, which was once the site of a large Brooklyn Union Gas tank. And it actively worked politically and organizationally to win the project for the area.
"We assembled a team to bid on the project," Mr. Towery said. "We sought out Hines and Gruzen Samton to be the architects." He said the architectural firm was chosen because it had designed much of York College and the Federal building, which is nearby.
"When you are working in places like Jamaica, you have to realize that you are in the boroughs, not Manhattan," said Peter Samton, one of the principals of the firm. He said the use of a red brick facade would help the F.D.A. building blend in with others on the campus and in the neighborhood.
Gruzen Samton is designing the building in association with HLW Ltd., an architectural firm specializing in laboratories. "They will do the labs and we will do all the outside, the office and the atrium," Mr. Samton said.
The Greater Jamaica-Hines group, one of three finalists on the project, was selected by the G.S.A. in June. Under the terms of the deal, Hines will pay $297,000 a year in ground rent (with a 15 percent escalation every five years) to CUNY, which will have to develop other parking to replace the lot that is being lost. The 250 remaining spaces at the site will be reserved for F.D.A. employees and visitors.
Hines has floated a 20-year private placement bond issue of $83 million to pay for construction and professional fees and will be repaid through lease payments starting at $8.5 million a year, which is to cover payment of debt and fees for management of the building.
BECAUSE the building is on what is, ultimately, city-owned land and is deeded to the Dormitory Authority, it is exempt from city taxes, Mr. Farley explained. "Exemption from city real estate taxes was critical to this site," he said. "If the government is paying a market rental and there are no real estate taxes, that means you can move more money into development."
Jeff Spiritos, the Hines vice president closest to the project, said there was never any plan to use public financing, despite the public nature of the ownership and tenants. "The F.D.A. put out a set of specifications that was five inches thick, and it was up to the developer to figure a way to finance, build and operate it at a price lower than what Congress authorized," he said.
As the operator of the building, Hines will provide maintenance, cleaning, engineering and most other services. One that it will not is security. "This will be a highly secure building and the government is providing its own security," Mr. Spiritos said.
Meeting the requirements of the various government agencies, while preserving the flexibility and economics of the private developer, were the reason it took several years to pull the F.D.A. project together, Mr. Farley said. "It was the first time most of the participants worked with each other," he said.
Along the way, the developers, architects and local backers grew comfortable with the mind-numbing acronyms so beloved of government officials. They learned that a S.F.O. is a "solicitation for offer," which is an invitation to bid on a project. Similarly the last bid is a B.A.F.O. (pronounced baf-o), standing for "best and final offer."

HEADLINE: FILM;
From a Vanished Country, a Viewable Cold-War Archive

BYLINE: By KEN SHULMAN 

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass.

 BODY:
THESE MEN WERE decidedly not the victors. Instead of striding, they shuffled into an auditorium on the campus of the University of Massachusetts as if they were the bewildered colonels of a vanquished army. In fact, they were producers, directors, actors and screenwriters who, as employees of Deutsche Film AG, the East German state film studio, had become virtually obsolete seven years ago with the unification of Germany.
"You must try and understand, it was such a wonderful thing for us to be able to make films," said Wolfgang Kolhaase, the author of more than 20 screenplays produced in East Germany. Mr. Kolhaase, one of the few studio employees who has found steady employment in the West since 1990, had come here earlier this month to take part in a conference on East German film and, more specifically, a Deutsche Film AG archive established by the university. 
 "Of course we weren't as well paid as our colleagues in the West," he continued. "But money wasn't the primary objective. It didn't have the same meaning for us as it did in Hollywood. We made films as an attempt to define a society where justice and not money was the guiding principle. Yes, of course there were problems, and there was censorship. But show me a country where they give you money to make a film and don't pose some conditions on its content."
Between 1946 and 1990, Deutsche Film AG, which is also known by the acronym DEFA, produced 750 feature films, 200 children's films and more than 3,000 documentaries.
"The DEFA archive is a collection of unknown films from a country that stopped existing in 1990," said Barton Byg, a professor of Germanic languages and literature at the university who was responsible for bringing the East German films here. "It is an important part of German cultural history -- and, as I become increasingly aware, of cold-war history. Of course there are plenty of halfhearted attempts to put the best face on East Germany. But even the ideologically overburdened clunkers earn a begrudging respect because DEFA was a very technically accomplished studio."
Beginning with its first feature, the 1946 film noir "Die Morder Sind Unter Uns" ("The Murderers Are Among Us"), the studio in East Berlin worked to establish a tradition of antifascism, and it tried to use that tradition to claim legitimacy both for itself and for East Germany.
"Antifascism has always been a main theme in East German cinema," said Ralf Schenk, a representative of Progress Film-Verleih, a Berlin company that owns the rights to the Deutsche Film AG films and has given the archive to the university on extended loan. "In West Germany, this theme disappears in the 1960's, with the appearance of the New Wave. Certainly there were difficult truths to come to grips with in both countries. But it was even more difficult to deal with the remaking of society in East Germany than it was in West Germany."
The Deutsche Film AG productions included several movies that were acclaimed internationally. One, "Jakob der Lugner" ("Jacob the Liar"), directed by Frank Beyer, received an Oscar nomination for best foreign film in 1974. Another, "Die Frau und der Fremde" ("The Woman and the Foreigner"), directed by Rainer Simon, won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival (a West German event) in 1985.
Many well-known actors, writers and directors, including Bertolt Brecht and Armin Mueller-Stahl, worked in the East German film industry. And the movies made by Deutsche Film AG were certainly not all high art or heavy-handed propaganda.
THERE WERE COMEDIES, musicals and operas. Between 1965 and 1983, the East German studio even produced 14 westerns. Shot on location in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Soviet Union and Cuba, and usually starring a hulking former physical-education instructor named Gojko Mitic, these so-called Indianerfilme are as clumsy and predictable as many of Hollywood's cowboy films. There is one notable distinction: in East German westerns, the American Indians are always the good guys.
The archive has been established by the University of Massachusetts to give scholars and commercial distributors access to the East German films. Still, few people are expecting Hollywood distributors to rush to Amherst. Many American filmgoers may be familiar with West German directors like Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders, and many have viewed numerous Russian films and movies from former Soviet bloc countries like Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. But the films of East Germany are almost wholly unknown in the West.
"I think the obscurity of East Germany film was really a marketing problem," said Dr. Byg. "Poland and Czechoslovakia and Hungary did not have a West Poland or a West Hungary in whose shadow they stood. East German cinema wasn't recognized as a national cinema because it had a sort of schizophrenic identity. And the DEFA people really weren't very good at figuring out where their export market might be."
In the West, East Germany was synonymous with gloom, intellectual conformity and unrelenting boredom, and Dr. Byg and his colleagues are aware that interest in East Germany has waned even further after unification. Some of the harshest words about East Germany and its culture, of course, have come from West Germans.
In 1992, the director Volker Schlondorff ("The Tin Drum") dismissed the history of Deutsche Film AG as abysmal. "I've had more interesting discussions with architects and engineers than with DEFA scriptwriters," he wrote in a journal article entitled "Was Stinkt Hier" ("What Stinks Here").
The name Deutsche Film AG was actually not struck from the record until 1992, when the Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, a German-based subsidiary of a French company, the Compagnie Generale des Eaux, purchased the studio from the Treuhandanstalt, a German agency assigned to privatize state-run companies. With that purchase, thousands of people lost their jobs.
For some East German film professionals, the loss of a forum for analyzing the problems of their vanished country was more traumatic than unemployment. "We still wanted to shoot films about Stalinism and reckon with our own past," said Michael Gwisdeck, an actor. "Naturally, no one wants to see this sort of thing at the movies anymore. And no one wants to finance it."
The conference here opened with a screening of "Die Morder Sind Unter Uns," and also included showings of films by leading directors like Mr. Beyer, Mr. Simon, Konrad Wolf and Heiner Carow. Attendance at the screenings was strong, and the response to many of the films was enthusiastic. But while Deutsche Film AG seems to have found a niche in North America, at least among students and scholars, the studio's former employees are struggling to reinvent themselves in a world where their ideas and values are considered as worthless as their old country's currency.
"We all need time to digest the new situation, to fully grasp the new realities in Germany and in the world," said Mr. Kolhaase, who since 1990 has written and directed a film, completed two screenplays and worked in the theater in the unified Germany. "One tends to understand these things more quickly in the mind than in the heart. And for a filmmaker, this is a problem, because a good film must always come from the heart."

HEADLINE: In Mexico, the Prices Are Right, in Dollars or Pesos

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF 

DATELINE: ROSARITO, Mexico

 BODY:
THE distinction between Mexico and the United States can seem unclear along parts of the coastal highway in Baja California, given the proliferation of billboards in English that advertise housing developments with "Models Open." Paying for a home can be just as disorienting, with prices in dollars, not pesos.
Thousands of American retirees and weekend vacationers, lured by the low cost of living and the spectacular views of sunburnt hillsides and rugged seashore, own homes here in Rosarito, a town of 13,000, located 20 miles south of San Diego. The local real estate agents aim at Americans for much of their business, hence the brochures that list home amenities like "breakfast bar," "Jacuzzi tub," and "spacious pantries." 
 Sales to Americans are just starting to recover from Mexico's economic and political turmoil of the last few years, which left many development projects under construction looking deserted. The country's reputation for beautiful whitewashed villages and glorious beaches was supplanted in the minds of many potential buyers by worrisome reports of drug trafficking and corruption.
But most veteran homeowners like Donald R. Thompson, a retired sales manager for a publishing company, only gloat about their decision to move to Mexico. As ocean swells crashed on the beach just a few dozen yards from his second-story balcony, Mr. Thompson told of his weekly games of golf on a nearby course, frequent games of tennis and the exorbitant cost of buying a similar home on the beach in California.
"It's heaven here," said Mr. Thompson, 75, who moved from San Diego to the Club Marena development in Rosarito four years ago. "I wouldn't live anywhere else. I have everything I need here."
"People who haven't been here talk about crime and all of that," he added. "But it's probably safer here than in the United States, and the people are just wonderful."
Mr. Thompson's three-bedroom condominium apartment, which he shares with his wife, Julie, is in an 11-story tower that overlooks a lawn, gym and swimming pool. The 2,800-square-foot apartment, which he bought for $315,000, features red tile floors, arched doorways and a dining area with a domed ceiling. It has conveniences like a dishwasher that are typical of a middle-class home in the United States.
"There's no way I could afford a place like this in California, if one so close to the shore existed," said Mr. Thompson, who, when he lived in San Diego, could afford only a small condominium three miles from the beach.
Club Marena, which was opened in 1990 by a Mexican developer, Jamie Garcia, has expanded to four buildings from one. Prices of the 96 units range from $240,000 for a 1,400-square-foot apartment to $500,000 for one couple's 4,800-square-foot custom-built penthouse. Vacancies are rare.
EXPERTS say housing costs in Mexico are 30 to 40 percent cheaper than for a comparable home in the United States, and that property taxes are about half those in California. So it is no surprise that Americans make up nearly 90 percent of Club Marena's occupants.
Most owners use their homes only on weekends or vacations. But about 10 are full-time residents, many of whom drive 45 minutes once a week across the border to San Diego to shop at a mall, see a movie in English or attend a concert.
With so many Americans in northern Baja California, some living in luxury with maids and cooks, others in trailers on dusty lots not far from slum neighborhoods, the area's traditional rural atmosphere has become enmeshed with California's beach culture. One restaurant operating from a roadside shack in Rosarito specializes in "surfing tacos."
Mexican real estate laws have not been similarly Americanized, however, and buyers from north of the border may find the regulations unfamiliar. That fact, plus lax research, has led some Americans to be swindled out of their money by buying property from someone who did not own it.
One difference is that real estate agents in Mexico are unlicensed and not required to have any professional training. Second, foreigners who buy a house within 31 miles of the coast and 62 miles of the border are forbidden from holding title to their property. Instead, the property title must be held by a Mexican bank and placed in a trust called a "fideicomiso," with the home buyer designated as the beneficiary.
The arrangement costs several thousand dollars to initiate and several hundred dollars in annual fees, and must be renewed every 50 years. Though the process seems intricate, experts say foreign home buyers in Mexico have the same property rights as if they were in the United States and, contrary to what some fear, the Mexican Government will not one day appropriate their land.
"It's not that an American can't own property," said Dennis John Peyton, a lawyer who helps Americans buy property in Mexico and the author of "How to Buy Real Estate in Mexico" (Law Mexico Publishing, 1994). "They might not be able to hold title, but they have all the rights to enjoy the property and to sell it whenever they want."
One new development that may make buying a home more familiar to Americans is the availability of financing from an American mortgage company. For example, the Metrociti Mortgage Company, in Sherman Oaks, Calif., is offering a 25-year mortgage in Mexico with an interest rate of 11 percent to 12 percent, 3 to 4 percentage points higher than for a home in the United States. The mortgage interest on a personal residence is considered tax-deductible by the Internal Revenue Service.
In the past, American mortgage companies refused to offer mortgages in Mexico because of the potential complications of foreclosing on property across an international border. As a result, home buyers had to pay in cash or take out a loan in Mexico.
"The North American Free Trade Agreement legitimized doing business in Mexico," said Tim Kruger, director of Metrociti Mortgage. "We can be more confident about our mortgages, because Nafta made it more certain that our Government would get involved if there were problems."
Real estate experts in Mexico predict that the housing market will continue its slow recovery from the peso devaluation of 1994, when the value of the peso was cut in half, and the subsequent political scandals. Virtually all development has been halted since the troubles began. Recently the peso has been worth around 13 cents in American money.
While the prices of some homes have declined or can be bargained down as a result, others are said to be pegged to the dollar and do not fluctuate. Americans, suffering from their own recession and apprehensive about Mexico's future, have until recently been unwilling to buy.
"Mexico is in the process of becoming a democratic nation," said Bo Wallsten, president and co-owner of the Century 21 real estate company in Mexico City. "We're only in Year 10. We'll have a lot of hiccups along the way."
BEFORE buying property in Mexico, some Americans take organized trips to popular retirement areas with companies that offer seminars explaining the country's real estate procedures, immigration law and medical care system. Destinations include Cabo San Lucas, on the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula; Puerto Vallarta, on the Pacific coast, and Lake Chapala, Mexico's largest lake, located inland near Guadalajara.
Loujean LaMalfa, the president of Prince LaMalfa International, a company in Petaluma, Calif., that offers tours, said she advises potential buyers to do their research, look out for disreputable real estate agents and be understanding of Mexico's relaxed pace of business and abundance of poverty.
No matter what some people say, Ms. LaMalfa added, the cost of living comfortably in Mexico is not negligible. She said a couple who rent a home, enjoy regular nights on the town and employ a housekeeper can expect to spend $2,000 a month.
"Telling people that they can live in Mexico for $400 a month is doing them a real disservice," Ms. LaMalfa said. "You can do that, but it depends on whether you want to live without electricity."

HEADLINE: A Hartford Arena Becomes a Draw

BYLINE: By R. L. FELSON 

 BODY:
IT is a warm autumnal evening, with a harvest moon aglow, as Fleetwood Mac opens its reunion tour before a crowd of 20,000 fans. Outside the concert, rows of white, stretch limousines idle as their passengers -- including many corporate executives in expensive box seats -- enjoy the show. Up on the lawn, nearly 13,000 younger fans sway and holler exclamations of joy with the band's every song.
In the music industry, the kickoff of Fleetwood Mac's national tour, after 15 years off stage, is a big event, and this could be New York, Los Angeles or Chicago. But it's Hartford, once an unlikely venue for major league concerts. More specifically, it's the Meadows Music Theater, a $31 million concert amphitheater financed in part by the state of Connecticut. 
 The three-year-old amphitheater, pushed by former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., and other state officials, not only has brought new night life to a city that often seems deserted after business hours, but also has given Connecticut music fans a chance to see popular music acts that they once had to drive out of state to hear. "These sorts of amazing things happen in primary markets, not secondary markets like Hartford," said Jim Koplik, the president of the Meadows, who at 48, will mark 30 years as a rock concert promoter in Connecticut next year.
Because bands over the past decade increasingly have turned to playing outdoors during the summer, many big-name acts had bypassed Connecticut, including the Hartford Civic Center and the New Haven Coliseum, to play nearby outdoor venues like Great Woods, in southeastern Massachusetts.
Moreover, because the amphitheater includes a heating system and a set of retractable walls that enclose the 6,900 reserved seats, the Meadows can operate yearround, making it the second most expensive amphitheater ever built. The world's first indoor-outdoor concert theater is the Blockbuster-Sony Entertainment Center in Camden, N.J.
Since its opening the summer of 1995, marquee artists including Hootie and the Blowfish, Michael Bolton, James Taylor, Crosby, Stills & Nash, the Allman Brothers, Santana, Alice Cooper, Courtney Love, Sting, Jimmy Buffet, Dave Matthews and David Bowie have played the Meadows.
In the last year, Mr. Koplik has managed to lure several nationally touring bands to the Meadows to rehearse their act. He has been able to draw bands to Hartford for rehearsals in part because the costs of hotels and other expenses for bands and their stage crews are so much lower than in cities like New York or Boston, and because the amphitheater, unlike other multi-purpose concert halls, does not double as a hockey rink or basketball court or circus venue.
Fleetwood Mac, for example, was scheduled to open its 37-city tour at Great Woods, Mass., but Mr. Koplik offered them the Meadows for rehearsals for free if they opened in Hartford. The move earned Hartford national media attention when the band launched its big comeback tour from the capital city.
Other bands, including David Bowie, Aerosmith and AC/DC also have used the amphitheater as a rehearsal hall. Yes, which opened its North American tour at the Meadows Oct. 17 was the most recent band to rehearse at the amphitheater. Because the Meadows offers bands one of the largest stages on the East Coast, coupled with easy load-in access and reasonable stagehand costs, some bands, like Aerosmith, will rehearse at the Meadows even if their tours don't open there.
Built in the city's industrial North Meadows about a mile north of downtown, the site is easy for fans to get to and get home from, situated just off Interstate 91 and close to Interstate 84. As a result, the amphitheater has been a relatively easy sell for residents who live within a 60-minute radius of Hartford, from New Haven and New London to the south, Waterbury to the west and Springfield, Mass., to the north.
While most outdoor amphitheaters are often built in rural areas so they don't bother neighbors, the Meadows has caused virtually no noise problems because its location is far enough from residential neighborhoods. Its proximity to downtown Hartford was actually a selling point when the project was first floated by state officials, as a potential boon to revitalize Hartford's night life. But that promise has yet to fully be realized.
Robb Hankins, the executive director of the Greater Hartford Arts Council and a leading advocate of leveraging the arts for the city's economic benefit, said the Meadows remains a dream in the making. "To have people like Tina Turner eight blocks from my office on a regular basis is like a dream come true. And those of us in arts and entertainment are delighted the Meadows is here. We just want it to do more and be more," said Mr. Hankins, who was largely responsible for creating the city's downtown arts and entertainment district as a way to capitalize on the variety of such venues in Hartford.
The challenge, said Mr. Hankins, is that the Meadows is a mile north of the arts and entertainment district. With a highway overpass, parking lots and industrial areas for pedestrians to contend with, that distance is apparently far enough to discourage many Meadows fans from spending time before or after the concert at downtown restaurants.
A shuttle bus between downtown and the Meadows ran as an experiment during the first season, but that service no longer is available, yet Mr. Hankins said ways need to be discovered to better connect the Meadows to downtown.
Mr. Koplik, a Stamford resident who now spends most of his time at the Meadows, says he has expressed a willingness to sit down with downtown leaders to discuss how better to make the Meadows work for the downtown.
Nevertheless, hotels report an increase in business as a result of the Meadows, not only from some out-of-town fans but also from the bands and stage crews, said Marjorie Morrissey, executive director of Business for Downtown Hartford, a trade group representing downtown restaurants, retailers and the service industry. And she said that while the hoped-for economic impact from the Meadows has taken a while, with every year more and more people connect Hartford with the Meadows.
As more premiere artists play the Meadows, Ms. Morrissey said, Hartford will continue to benefit with good public relations. Lately, the Meadows has had to weather a barrage of bad publicity in connection with ethical violations in which state officials and employees, including Gov. John G. Rowland, received an estimated $10,000 in free concert tickets from the Meadows and its lobbyist, violating a law limiting gifts from lobbyists to $50 a year.
The $30 million amphitheater received about $20 million in state financing, including about $10 million from the Connecticut Development Authority under a relatively new formula called tax-increment financing, in which the state uses sales and ticket tax revenues from the amphitheater to pay off the bonds. Roy Breward, the deputy director of the Development Authority, said the Meadows has been making its payments on time and is up to date.
The theater was developed by Mr. Koplik, who was president of Metropolitan Entertainment in New Jersey, and the Nederlander Organization of Chicago, a theatrical giant.
Earlier this year, radio giant SCF Broadcasting Inc., purchased the Meadows, although Mr. Koplik continues to run the amphitheater. One major difference, Mr. Koplik said, is that unlike past seasons, this year he has been at every concert to respond to fans' complaints. As a result, he said SFX has invested about $1 million in improvements to the site this past season, including the addition of new state-of-the-art video screens and projection system for fans on the lawn to see the stage better. Mr. Koplik also has added new speakers into the corners of the enclosed part of the amphitheater, where fans complained of poor acoustics.
In addition, he has begun to open up the site to the public for special events as a sign of his willingness to play a greater role in the community. When Hartford's Superintendent of Schools, Patricia A. Daniel welcomed back 4,500 teachers late last summer, Mr. Koplik, who is married to a teacher, allowed the school system to use the Meadows at cost.
He has also opened the Meadows up for college graduation ceremonies and other children's programs. "It's good for the community, and it's good for us, and we've only just begun," said Mr. Koplik.
Paul Shipman, an aide to Hartford's Mayor Mike Peters, said, "It's certainly helped put Hartford on the map as an entertainment venue and a place where people can come to see top notch entertainment in the region."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S VIEW;
Where a Democracy and Its Money Have No Place

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
EARLIER THIS YEAR, JANE ALEXANDER, THE departing chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, wearily spoke of recurring Congressional attempts to "drive a stake in the heart of Federal funding for the arts." She called these exorcistic rites a "nearly debilitating annual Sturm und Drang that threatens to suck the life out of all arts advocates."
It is too soon to say if the annual Sturm and Drang will achieve its threatened goal, but here is a working critic's confession: if this perpetual drama actually reaches its final wrenching cadences, it will be a relief. Andres Serrano's urine-soaked crucifix, Robert Mapplethorpe's penile photographs, Jesse Helms's outrage and invocations of family values -- all will become quaint memories. So will endowment reports like the one released on Oct. 15 that accuses the arts of the sin of elitism. 
 Finally, we will be able to pay attention to the real problem -- something that might be called the "ideology of democracy." In this vision of the world, not only are all people created equal but so are all ideas and all cultures. Even art -- an essentially undemocratic achievement by extraordinarily gifted individuals -- is thrust into a marketplace marked by clamorous demands for democratic distribution. How can a national agency act as a patron in such an atmosphere? It can't. And it shouldn't. R.I.P.
Before the grave is dug, it might be worth reviewing the all-too-familiar N.E.A. debate. The endowment began in 1965 as part of the same Great Society enterprise that declared war on poverty; that utopian spirit still characterizes its defense. N.E.A. supporters point out that all great nations help finance the arts -- France spends $32 a person and Germany $27 -- but the annual costs of the endowment have been no more than 38 cents per capita. That small amount, though, has large repercussions.
 
Endowment Money Talks, But Interpretations Differ
According to the endowment, each N.E.A. dollar inspires $11 more in matching grants. Since its founding, the number of orchestras has quadrupled; there are eight times as many theaters; annual audiences for the arts exceed those of all sports events combined. The arts also create $37 billion in economic activity and support 1.3 million jobs. Finally, less than 40 of the 110,000 grants ever given by the N.E.A. have been controversial.
The organization's opponents see a very different picture. The controversial grants, with their provocative sexual, political or religious imagery, are viewed as just extreme examples of the N.E.A. helping to pull the fringe closer to the mainstream. Endowment-inspired matching grants are part of the problem, not solution: they further institutionalize the N.E.A.'s attitudes.
And if the endowment has helped increase the quantity of art, it is debatable whether the quality has improved. Economic benefits are also beside the point: if the goal is fiscal health, there are more efficient methods. Countries like France and Germany hardly offer a model for American patronage; they are too different in character and history. The Government should get out of the business of art criticism.
Underlying these arguments, though, is a more fundamental issue. In the political arena, where deals are made and budgets determined, the N.E.A. is debated with little understanding of what art is all about or what the function of a patron is; among politicians and, indeed, within the endowment, major decisions are being influenced by the ideology of democracy.
That ideology begins with one of the great liberal ideas that defined this country: equality is not something attained or purchased or inherited. It is simply possessed, universally, at birth. Failures to realize this ideal have done nothing to weaken its strength: when we stand before the law as citizens, we are supposed to stand equally.
But as de Tocqueville realized, such a revolutionary idea could not be applied in the political realm without also resonating in all other aspects of American life. In fact, it has now become the defining aspect of American culture. We are so loath to make distinctions (except to correct earlier distinctions) that we now doubt whether any are worthwhile or even possible. We ask democracy to be the moral, spiritual and esthetic compass by which our culture evolves.
The problem is that art is incompatible with this ideology. It is engaged in constant acts of discrimination. Moreover, the ability to create it is no more distributed according to democratic principles than is the ability to play basketball like Michael Jordan or chess like Gary Kasparov. There are differences between us at birth that the civil order must ignore but the esthetic order is beholden to. Even the evaluation of art is guided by such undemocratic gauges as cultivated taste and extensive experience.
 
Can Democratic Ideals Be Used to Judge Art?
So there is a tension at the very heart of the N.E.A.: How can a national agency in a democracy make decisions that are, in their very essence, anti-democratic?
This was an issue raised during the initial debates about whether a Federal arts agency should even be established. Initially, many major arts institutions were opposed to a Federal arts program. In 1953, a survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League, the service organization for American orchestras, showed that 99 percent of orchestra board members opposed Federal aid. Aside from the leaders of community orchestras, members of the league remained lukewarm on Federal aid even into the 1960's. Orchestras and the fine arts, many organizations argued, could only be sullied by the interference of politicians who were neither trained nor inclined to make proper decisions.
The skepticism did not disappear once the N.E.A. was established. Who, after all, would be given the power to make judgments about grants? By what right would anybody's tastes, values and standards prevail over anybody else's? The way such elite activities were reconciled with democratic aspirations was to create an institutional hybrid: the main decision-making was seemingly removed from the realm of democratic politics and ceded to professionals. An elite jury of peers would evaluate each application.
This created a new style of artistic patronage. The panel system rejected the idea that we are all equal in judging art, but still turned the judging of art into a "democratic" process. A larger bureaucracy was required to administer the panel system, to assess results "objectively" and to justify the judgments to those holding the purse strings.
The panel system also strengthened the ideology of democracy within the N.E.A. The composition of panels became politically important. Panels were treated as if they should be representative bodies, their members speaking for different constituencies.
While politics has always been a handmaiden to patronage -- older models of arts support by court and church involved notorious quantities of infighting and favoritism -- the emphasis on accountability created a new kind of bureaucratic politics. Artistic patronage was thrust into the public marketplace, to be buffeted about by conflicting claims. Forget individual taste; the demand was for representation.
During the last two decades this demand has become even more fervent as democratic ideology has taken root in the art world itself. The very idea of artistic quality has become open to question. Many artists have become preoccupied with making ideological statements. And advocates of multiculturalism have questioned the priority of Western standards and styles.
In such a landscape, what sort of patron of the arts has the N.E.A. become? It takes equitable distribution as a principle of its patronage. It is preoccupied with the size of audiences. It focuses on insuring equal participation by different interest groups. It retains a notion of "excellence" but makes that idea contingent on the opinions of its constituencies. And nothing can be excluded. The endowment boasts that it "reaches Americans of every race, class, ethnicity and geographic region" and "supports community festivals, rural chamber music, art exhibitions in libraries and town halls, lawn concerts."
The N.E.A. has tended to treat financial support of the arts as if the money had to be distributed according to various formulas of representation -- calculating, to a tenth of a percentage point, funds distributed to each state and ethnic group. Its judging panels in recent years have been created using something resembling an ethnic quota: about a third have consistently been "minorities" -- American Indians, Asians, blacks or Hispanics -- and about 48 percent have been women.
The result is that the N.E.A. has ended up becoming a multicultural clearing house. When the agency was criticized recently for a grant to the California Indian Basket Weavers Association, Ms. Alexander defended "this world-renowned form of traditional art mastered by Native Americans." No other distinctions were necessary.
As a consequence, there appears to be no central vision, simply the clamor of political forces. This is evident in the recent revisions of grant categories, established not according to discipline, like theater or music, but according to principles, like Access, Heritage or Preservation. Such categories give more emphasis to the political benefits of support than to the arts themselves.
 
If the N.E.A. Is Not Elitist, Why Is It Needed?
So without a homogeneous culture, without an education system that creates a deep understanding of artistic traditions, without a realization that art is more than entertainment, public patronage becomes a market phenomenon, responding to conflicting demands, competing bids, promises of influence. We have a democratic society; we demand democratic arts.
It is astonishing how thoroughly this idea has been accepted in Washington, without any inkling that it might conflict with the very essence of traditional patronage of the arts or artistic accomplishment. Newt Gingrich and the Republicans thought they were making an incisive criticism of the N.E.A. when they called it "elitist." The agency's allies responded with outrage at the supposed insult. On Oct. 15, the endowment went a step further in its report, "American Canvas, an Arts Legacy for Our Communities," blaming arts institutions for being elitist. Each group thought the word a slur rather than a matter of pride. But if the N.E.A. is not elitist, what do we need it for?
Attempts by Republicans to create a test of artistic "decency" also ended up revealing an esthetic vacuum. The arts were treated as if their function was to communicate proper "values" to the public. Washington liberals took a similarly vulgar view, focusing on their own versions of "values" and treating art as a form of social therapy doled out to interest groups. As much as the right's opposition, the left's defense has tended to piety and religious fervor.
Even the courts have got into the act. When the endowment's "decency" test for determining the financing of artworks was struck down earlier this year, the court argued that the Government could not deny a work support because of ideas or point of view. This was hailed as a triumph for free speech. But if a patron cannot decide whether or not to financially support a work because of its ideas or point of view, on what grounds can it decide? Form? Style?
So the ideology of democracy leaves us with a vision of the arts that is pure pork barrel. At this moment, there are few Congressional Democrats or Republicans with any deep understanding of cultural life apart from television or movies. There is nothing to temper the ideology of democracy, only opinion to support it. And this, of course, affects the kind of "art" being created. One criterion for the authenticity of democratic art is that it stir "controversy": controversy means that it is noticed by the most people and justifies its cost. Immediate sensation becomes important. So do practical benefits and notions of "relevance."
Paradoxically, though, the ideology of democracy may suggest a means for developing a national artistic culture. It is not to be found in democracy itself but in the intellectual, religious and esthetic traditions that led to its development. If those traditions were really at the center of the N.E.A., there might be some chance for national patronage; they might encourage a more healthy artistic diversity, free from democratic demands.
 
There Is a Model For an Arts Paradise
Prime examples of institutions that have offered such alternatives are the great museums -- like the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Here many esthetic universes coexist, with each culture's most elite and extraordinary objects on display. But they are housed in an enterprise unmistakably based on Western traditions of knowledge and judgment. The museum is made possible by combining Western-style scholarship with multicultural expertise. The Met could evolve in that fashion because it didn't have to answer to democratic constituencies, only to its curators, who shared common goals.
A contemporary public patron like the N.E.A. could have similar ideals, but that would mean declaring independence from democratic ideology and being ready to withstand the righteous outrage that would follow. It may be that at this moment of cultural and political fragmentation, a public patron could best serve the public by educating it in art's undemocratic character, focusing on the cultivation of educated eyes and ears. This would turn the patron into a conservator rather than a supporter of new works -- a role with risks and restrictions, but with far fewer than democratic dilettantism. The more effective grants of the current N.E.A. could then be built upon.
Optimism, though, may be uncalled for. The sad aspect of modern American culture is that we created a National Endowment for the Arts we deserve. The even sadder aspect is that the way things stand now, what we really deserve is no N.E.A. at all.

'Side Show' Asks, What Is Normal?

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

 BODY:
IF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN "Freaks," Tod Browning's macabre 1932 horror-film classic, you have seen the Hilton sisters -- Daisy and Violet, Siamese twins. With their unexceptional features, carefully waved hair and eyebrows fashionably plucked, they are almost pretty in the low-key way of two girls next door. Yet their heads are a little too large for their compact bodies and, more important, they are joined at the hip.
The sisters were on display for much of their lives, that is, from the instant they were born in England in 1908 through their show business careers in this country in the 1920's and into the 1940's. When, finally, vaudeville no longer called and interest in such oddities of nature declined, they settled near Charlotte, N.C., where they worked in a supermarket. They died in 1969. 
 In the film, they don't do much. They are impassive presences, nonactors who have been told where to stand and what to look at, but they are in many scenes. They are members of the chorus of sideshow "freaks" who bear witness to, and take terrible revenge on, the circus's beautiful aerialist who marries the sideshow's midget for his money. "Freaks" is still a disturbing film, as it observes, with an existential detachment, the fierce, brutal "otherness" of a community of people who feel forever estranged from the so-called normal world.
Taking the story of the Hilton sisters as their inspiration, Bill Russell, who wrote the book and lyrics, Henry Krieger, the composer, and Robert Longbottom, the director and choreographer, have conceived the astonishingly effective new musical called "Side Show," now at the Richard Rodgers Theater.
In spite of its smart, melodic, often funny words and music, its idealization of Daisy and Violet as Broadway beauties of real talent, and its simplification of circumstances, "Side Show" is almost as disturbing as "Freaks." There is no violence here, but the twins, condemned to live in a world of "normals," are denied the satisfactions of the only lives they have been taught are worth living.
In this respect "Side Show" recalls "The Elephant Man," the 1980 David Lynch film about John Merrick, the turn-of-the-century London working-class lad who was grossly deformed at birth by neurofibromatosis. The sorrowful thing about Merrick is that he denies his rage at his condition. He suppresses his roaring ego to accept the values of the fussily genteel upper middle class, which briefly celebrates him only because he is so horribly different.
This may be heroism, but it's of a kind that strikes most of us as inconceivable -- unbearable, really. It also represents a terrible surrender, not unlike the sort expected of the victim of Stalin's Moscow trials in Arthur Koestler's "Darkness at Noon." It demands faith in a faith that is not one's own. Which is why "Side Show" is so haunting. Even as you wonder -- as I do -- whether Siamese twins are a significant metaphor for the human condition, you have the suspicion that you are seeking a way to avoid facing questions too primal to answer honestly. What would it be like to be chained to a mirror image that sustains, comforts and infuriates you and that, in fact, is not you?
In the case of Daisy and Violet in "Side Show," played with uncanny precision and immense heart by, respectively, Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley, we are also put into the position of voyeurs. We're like the rude reporters who interview the twins from time to time within the show. As the sisters try desperately to demonstrate how normal they are, in the darkest recesses of our minds we are speculating about how they go about the most commonplace of daily functions; visions of their possible sex lives rattle our imaginations.
"Side Show" trades on this in its eerie prologue: the so-called "cannibal king," the bearded lady, the geek who bites the heads off chickens, the fat woman, the reptile man and all the other bizarre midway attractions silently come onto the stage to take their places in bleachers facing the audience, then taunt us as they issue their invitation in a mocking anthem titled "Come Look at the Freaks." From that moment on, the audience is always a bit on the defensive, while being deliciously conned by the show's expertise.
In outline the tale is more sentimental than it plays: the sisters, discovered in the carnival, are transformed into first-rate performing talents, moving first to vaudeville, where they become headliners, and then to stardom in what looks to be the Ziegfeld Follies. Yet even when they reach the top, their aspirations to achieve normal lives are thwarted.
Their mentors are two ambitious but essentially decent, ordinary guys, Terry Connor (Jeff McCarthy), a talent scout for the Orpheum circuit, and Buddy Foster (Hugh Panaro), a young sideshow usher who has the gift to teach the flat-footed, tone-deaf Hiltons how to become dancing, singing sensations.
As Daisy loves the go-getting Terry, the far less assertive Violet falls for Buddy. One of these would-be suitors, though intrigued by a twin, knows himself well enough to realize he can't carry through with anything as serious as a marriage. The second fellow, though fond of but not sexually aroused by the other twin, is ready to marry her just for the boost the publicity would give his career.
If "Side Show" depended on narrative, it would be deadly. Instead, with most of the dialogue sung, it is propelled and given emotional heft by Mr. Krieger's bright, inventive score (he is the composer of "Dreamgirls") and Mr. Russell's lyrics. The latter often have something of the intelligence, purity and wit you might have recognized in the work of Betty Comden and Adolph Green in the revival of "On the Town" in Central Park last summer.
THEN, TOO, THERE ARE THE contributions of Mr. Longbottom, as director and choreographer, who, I assume, also conceived (or, at least, realized) the show's overall concept. "Side Show," gorgeously designed by Robin Wagner, moves out of darkness into light and back again with often breathtaking effect. It looks lean, though it can suddenly erupt into a hilarious, elaborately dressed production number like "We Share Everything."
This number, which has an Ancient Egypt motif, introduces Daisy and Violet to the Orpheum circuit: the twins make their entrance from a double sarcophagus, seemingly inspired by Tutankhamen's, wearing short, spangly blue gowns and black wigs that recall Louise Brooks's trademark bob. Sample lyrics: "Two songbirds/ Zero friction/ No strong words/ Dainty diction/ Harmony is what we always sing/ We're so happy/ We share everything."
In support are eight male dancers. They
are scantily clad as generic pharoahs (and apparently none too at ease in their crazy get-ups) as they back up the cheery, conjoined temptresses with intricate dance patterns punctuated by furious though muted (for the vaudeville trade) bumps and grinds.
The lyrics are designed to tickle naughty funny bones, but the notion of the sisters sharing everything, a theme sounded time and again throughout the show, will soon return like a fatal boomerang in another duet, the lovely, double-edged "I Will Never Leave You."
Ms. Skinner and Ms. Ripley are an amazement. They not only look alike, as costumed by Gregg Barnes and lighted by Brian MacDevitt, but without any sort of harness, they also move, walk and, most spectacularly, dance together with the ease of creatures that a befuddled old God forgot to untie. Each clearly defines her own personality, and they sing with the zest of Broadway sweethearts.
Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Panaro are very good in roles that don't always seem consistent. It is difficult to believe that Mr. McCarthy's Terry, introduced as an easygoing ladies' man, would ever come on to Daisy as strongly as he does at first if, as it turns out, he is so put off by her singular attachment to her sister. As written, Mr. Panaro's Buddy also appears to change character halfway through.
The show's strongest supporting character is Jake, beautifully played and sung by Norm Lewis, though Jake is also the show's most glaring anachronism. He is the black sideshow worker who triples as the "cannibal king," the assistant to the sideshow's boss and the twins' protector and confidant, the only man capable of loving Violet for herself. Though the time of the show is the late 1920's and early 30's, he is seen socializing with the sisters in New York as well as at the Texas centennial celebration in San Antonio, which ends the show.
THIS IS DRAMATIC license and it pays off. Mr. Lewis has a big baritone and a stage personality that turn "The Devil You Know" and "You Should Be Loved" into two of the show's most affecting moments. Also to be noted is Ken Jennings, who plays the Boss, the rummy, vicious slob who has found his corner in life as the supreme ruler of a small band of society's rejects.
"Side Show" has its own original mind but it never pushes too hard. It doesn't alienate the audience, though as often as we're moved we are kept at a cool distance. It is less Brechtian than old-fashioned Broadway informed by a sharp, contemporary sensibility. Not in a long time has a new season begun with such promise.
 
'The American Clock'
This year the Signature Theater Company, which each season devotes its schedule to the work of a single playwright, is honoring Arthur Miller, and about time, too. The initial presentation is "The American Clock," now playing in the company's fine new space at 555 West 42d Street.
With the determination of the obsessive master he is, Mr. Miller has been tinkering with "The American Clock" ever since its premiere at the Harold Clurman Theater in New York early in 1980 and the productions that followed, each being an attempt to fix the problems of the earlier one. I may have been one of the few people who liked the production at the Clurman, and suspected that the play's problems were also the reason it was so moving. Now I'm not so sure.
"The American Clock" is a consideration of the awful economic, social and psychological dislocations caused by the Great Depression, based on material from Studs Terkel's book "Hard Times" and integrated with Mr. Miller's recollections of his own family's experiences.
There was always a difficulty in mixing the clearly documentary vignettes with Mr. Miller's personal stories. The vignettes, being far more vivid, exact and immediately significant, overwhelm the short scenes of the Baum (read Miller) family, which, at best, seem like notes for a play yet to be written.
That difficulty continues in the would-be jubilant production at the Signature, directed by James Houghton, the company's artistic chief, and labeled "a vaudeville," inspired by Peter Wood's hugely popular London staging in 1986. This "American Clock" is an attempt to do epic theater, and though a lively three-piece band and a cast of 15 have a high old time playing, singing and dancing dozens of irresistible period songs, the piece still bogs down in the family interludes, which, though often intriguingly idiosyncratic, never have time to gather dramatic momentum.
The designer, E. David Cosier, makes good use of the Signature's large new stage, the floor and side walls painted to look like a deconstructed American flag, the back wall painted to represent the big, fair sky that always hangs over an ideal America. The members of the cast, on stage from start to finish, come forward as needed to perform in an area defined by a huge wooden picture frame.
The play looks great and is performed by some splendid actors, among them Lewis J. Stadlen, as Mr. Miller's father, and Patrick Husted, who portrays Theodore K. Quinn, a marvelous, cranky, passionate American who resigned as president of General Electric after one day because he disliked the direction in which big business was headed.
Characters such as Quinn draw you into "The American Clock," not the whore who wants to know more about Engels and who sounds like an inspiration from a playwright's notebook.
 
SIDE SHOW -- A fascinating mix of old-fashioned Broadway and a sharp, contemporary sensibility.
 
THE AMERICAN CLOCK -- This would-be jubilant reworking of vintage Arthur Miller finally bogs down.

HEADLINE: Beyond 50 and Blazing Trails on the Frontier

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
ONE afternoon Carole Bobruff and Dale Callahan were at their kitchen table, talking about health care, money, entertainment, relationships and a sprightly fellow named Otto. Most mornings they're in a studio at radio station WSUB-AM in Groton, talking about such matters -- and more -- with listeners in a dozen states.
The Mystic residents are hosts of "Senior Focus," a radio show for those they call "seasoned citizens." The show, which began in 1990 with local, once-a-week broadcasts, has been syndicated since February. Now on the air Monday through Friday, it's a success with listeners and with advertisers. "I think that's because it's something that hasn't been done before," said Ms. Bobruff. She doesn't know of any other prime-time radio talk show "that's targeted to the needs of the 50-plus audience and reflects the tremendous diversity of our interests." There's certainly no other show where Otto -- a character that she created -- gets to speak his seasoned mind. 
 On the air, Ms. Bobruff, who's 62, uses the name Carole Marks. She and Mr. Callahan, who's 59, chat with each other, callers and guests (including politicians, doctors and a milkman). They aim to inform as well as entertain. "Now that we're living so much longer, we need information to get through the next 20 or 30 years," said Ms. Bobruff.
The two also hope to open some eyes to the needs, contributions and power of older people. "We're on a frontier, but people don't know it," Ms. Bobruff said. For one thing, Mr. Callahan said, advertisers are just beginning to recognize the growing market of people over 50. "They're still concentrating on people 24-45, but they're suddenly realizing that they may be targeting the wrong market. It's economics," he said.
Senior Focus is "a fight against agism -- and that's a fight that has to be fought," added Ms. Bobruff. On the show the character Otto (played by an actor) often observes that Americans treasure old things, not old people. "We have to turn our society around a little bit," said Ms. Bobruff.
The hour-long show is syndicated through Talk America II, a radio talk show network based in Canton, Mass. Besides reaching WSUB audiences in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Long Island, the show is sent via satellite to stations in Arkansas, California, Florida, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada and Texas. Broadcasts are live, not taped, with guests interviewed in the studio or by phone.
Much -- but not all -- has changed since 1990, when Ms. Bobruff, who'd been the director of a volunteer program staffed by older people, decided that a radio show could help older people be better informed and less isolated. She'd never done any radio work before, but she plunged into the tasks that she still carries out -- researching topics, scheduling interviews, writing scripts and selling advertisements. "I've never been afraid to take a risk," said Ms. Bobruff, who went to college in her 40's. Mr. Callahan, who'd never been involved in radio either, gamely became the show's producer. "We were together, and she needed some help," he explained. His past experience included selling insurance and cars.
In 1995, he became a co-host. He says that his sales background helps him to put people at ease, "so we can talk." Ms. Bobruff says, "It's valuable to have a male point of view."
Mr. Callahan reads three or four newspapers daily, to stay informed on varied issues and perspectives. Ms. Bobruff finds the Internet useful. The two share in the show's national and local advertising revenues. In Groton, Ms. Bobruff said, Senior Focus draws more local advertising than the Rush Limbaugh show.
Since syndication, Senior Focus has had more guests with national appeal. The hosts frequently mention toll-free numbers -- like that of a national insurance association, for instance -- so that listeners anywhere can get information on particular topics. This summer they introduced Otto, a character who has apparently lived for centuries. "He's the ultimate senior citizen," said Ms. Bobruff. "He's seen it all. He can comment."
Recent topics on the show have ranged from the workings of the weather to the discovery of the genes linked to macular degeneration, a visual impairment. Guests have included Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who discussed the state's settlement with tobacco companies; the artist Peter Max, who talked about his work, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who talked about his proposal to support training for medical students in gerontology.
It wasn't easy, Ms. Bobruff said, to persuade Jack LaLanne, the long-time promoter of physical fitness, to be interviewed at 9 A.M., Connecticut time. That's 6 A.M., California time -- and that's when Mr. LaLanne, a Californian who's 83, is into his daily workout. Nor was the 9 A.M. slot so good for the milkman who still makes daily deliveries. He was more tired than talkative, recalled Mr. Callahan, because he'd been up and working since 2 A.M.
The hosts said they especially enjoyed their interviews with older entertainers, including Steve Allen and cabaret singers like Julie Wilson and Margaret Whiting. "Lots of them are working," said Mr. Callahan. "They still sound good." Ms. Bobruff calls Mr. Allen, who's 76, "a mentor." He's given them advice and allowed them to use some of his music.
Senior Focus gets calls from people of varied ages. "We have lots of younger listeners," said Ms. Bobruff, adding that often younger people call because they're concerned about their parents.
Calls from different areas reveal regional differences, like more conservatism in the interior of the country. But more often they indicate common concerns. The hosts say that, everywhere, people who once served their country are distressed by cuts in military retirement benefits. And everywhere, said Ms. Bobruff, older people are concerned about "health, health and health." They're also worried about finances.
She and Mr. Callahan see plenty to be done. "If I could accomplish one thing through the show," said Ms. Bobruff, "it would be to try to work through the political system to get premiums for long-term care, and for home health care, completely tax deductible." That, she says, would make the expensive premiums more feasible for more people.
More attention should be paid, the hosts say, to problems like drinking and depression in the older population. Recently they informed listeners about a nation-wide depression-screening program.
They'd like to look at how much older people are helping their adult children these days. With downsizing and other changes in the workplace, Ms. Bobruff said, "It's so much harder for your children to become secure. You worry; you care, you're going to help out."
Mr. Callahan said, "There should be more talk about relationships between older people. People say, 'It's all over.' It's not true." He turned to Ms. Bobruff with a big smile. "Maybe," he said, "Otto can advise on personal relationships."

HEADLINE: Gilded Age Estates Hold a Key to Open-Space Efforts

BYLINE: By JOY ALTER HUBEL 

 BODY:
JUST off Jericho Turnpike in Cold Spring Hills, past a development of ranch houses, the medieval turrets of the Oheka Castle spring into view. That a 123-room chateau stands blocks from the shopping centers on Route 25 may be unusual.
Oheka is one example among hundreds of lavish country estates that have shaped Long Island history. And while many of the estates have yielded to subdivision and development, a number have been restored, converted to other uses or are in the process of refurbishment, preserving a tone and style that dates to many decades ago. 
 "Many people think of Newport, R.I., as the showcase for the nation's richest and most aristocratic families, but it is actually Long Island that boasts the most concentrated assortment of architecturally and historically noteworthy mansions in the country," said Robert B. MacKay, director of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities.
"These surviving estates are among the principal amenities of Long Island, and are one of the few remaining ways for us to protect the region's open spaces."
He added: "This region has undergone so much excess development that now people are concerned with preserving what is left of their environment and quality of life."
To promote preservation of the grand estates, the society, in association with W. W. Norton & Company, has published a 560-page guide, "Long Island Country Houses and Their Architects, 1860-1940," edited by Mr. MacKay and Anthony Baker and Carol Traynor, who are historians.
The book documents through essays and photographs the Gilded Age, when many millionaires could not spend their money -- or build their country homes -- flamboyantly enough.
"In the years between the Civil War and World War II," Mr. MacKay said, "over 1,000 Long Island country residences were built by some of the nation's richest financiers and industrialists, including the Vanderbilts, the Astors, the Morgans, the Whitneys and the du Ponts, who were drawn to Long Island because of its proximity to New York City and its abundance of woodlands, waterways and open spaces."
Many estates were designed to recreate the world of the European aristocracy. The rich modeled their homes after Italian villas, English manor houses and Celtic castles and commissioned the greatest architects and landscapers of the period, including MacKim, Mead & White; Delano & Aldrich, and the Olmsted brothers, designers of Central Park.
The most lavish country houses boasted amenities like private golf courses, polo fields, tennis courts, stables and boathouses.
Today little remains of that Gatsby-like world. Nevertheless that way of life has strongly influenced how Long Islanders live. Much like those tycoons, commuters strive to escape the pressures of work to the serenity of country, the vigor of sport and the company of friends, albeit on a different scale.
The estates, Mr. MacKay said, represent not only the architectural past, but also social and cultural roots.
The Town Historian of Glen Cove, Dan Russell, credited a new capitalist attitude for stanching the tide of estate destruction. "Twenty years ago," Mr. Russell said, "these estates were looked upon as white elephants owned by evil Robber Barons. Yet now we realize they represent tremendous social history. They describe a past that will never come again, a way of building that is superior to anything we have now, and a capitalistic heritage that is not so much about Robber Barons but heroic entrepreneurs."
Unfortunately the sentiment turned too late for many estates. About half have been lost, to the Depression, income taxes and rising land values and labor costs.
Many were divided to satisfy inheritance claims. Parts were sold to builders who subdivided sprawling terrain for smaller houses and condos.
Burrwood, an estate originally owned by Walter Jennings, an oil magnate, that sat on a bluff overlooking Cold Spring Harbor, was leveled in 1994. A builder, John Kean, subdivided the estate into single-family houses.
"In the 70's," Mr. MacKay said, "when demolition of these estates peaked, we didn't see private ownership as a solution for saving them. And yet in the 80's and 90's we have seen some people step forward to take on bigger ones."
One example is the purchase by George Campbell, an engineer and builder, of the 45-room Fort Hill estate in Lloyd Harbor in 1992. That same year Ronald O. Perleman, the financier, bought The Creeks, the estate of Alfonso Ossorio, the artist, in Wainscott.
Not long ago, the chief executive of Computer Associates, Charles Wang, bought the Youngs homestead in Cove Neck. It had previously been owned by P. James Roosevelt, first cousin twice removed of Theodore Roosevelt.
The vitality of estate ownership and restoration is being driven, in part, by prosperity, Mr. MacKay said, adding: "In fact it appears we are on the verge of a new country-house era. Flying over Long Island one can see a number of huge houses going up, the size of which we have not seen since before World War II."
The decision, however, to restore an existing mansion rather build a new one is not necessarily economical. An engineer who restores Gold Coast mansions, Bud Woodworth of Woodworth Associates, said a typical restoration would cost $100 to $150 a square foot.
Where individuals have not taken over estates, creative re-uses have often filled the gaps. More than 84 estates have been modified, for activities like schools, colleges, country clubs, nursing homes and conference retreats.
Sometimes the modifications harm an estate, as in the case of Oheka, according to Joan Cergol, a spokesman for the catering operation there. For a short period, Oheka was a retreat for sanitation workers and then, for several decades, it was a military school that eventually went broke. By 1980, when Gary Melius, a builder, bought it, each room was waist high in school supplies.
On the other hand a number of institutions have restored or preserved buildings to within inches of their glory. The Webb Institute for Naval Architecture in Glen Cove maintained the Jacobean-style estate that Herbert L. Pratt, a founder of the Standard Oil Company, built in 1912 in its original condition, including its carved wainscotting, molded plaster ceilings and water views.
The Phipps estate in Old Westbury Gardens and Coe Hall at Planting Fields in Oyster Bay are equally well restored. The former mansions offer good views of what life can be like on endless acres of gardens, woodlands and rolling hills and in rooms larger than many single-family dwellings.
Similar examples of successful restorations include Rynwood, once the estate of Sir Samuel Agar Salvage, a textile manufacturer, and Winfield, F. W. Woolworth's manor house in Glen Cove. Banfi Importers Inc. bought Rynwood in Old Brookville in 1979 from the estate of F. W. Luncy, the Sheepshead Bay restarateur. The wine importer restored Rynwood as a corporate headquarters.
The Pall Corporation, which leased Winfield Hall from Martin Carey, brother of ex-Gov. Hugh L. Carey, spent millions to restore the estate with its original gilt ceilings, a music room lined with intricate wood screens and a huge marble stairway. But now Pall, which used Winfield as a corporate retreat, is trying to retire its 99-year lease.
A 158-acred Muttontown estate owned by George S. Brewster is a recent rescue effprt. The Hoffman Foundation, set up by Maximillian Edwin Woffman , a foreign-car importer, and his wife Marion, bought it in 1995 from the Resolution Trust Company, which took it over from its former owner, Robert Meyer, who went bankrupt. The foundation plans to maintain the site as a preserve, a wildlife museum and an educational center.
The house will take five years to restore, beginning with the replacement of 99 windows with the original antique glass. The foundation, which bought the mansion, the farm complex and 158 acres for $8.1 million, won the mansion in an auction, triumphing over a number of builders.
Readaptations, although widely applauded as ways to save estates from unsympathetic development, sometimes run afoul of the community. Most estates exist in incorporated villages that are zoned for residential use, and communities are fearful of activity that is anything but residential.
Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi of Glen Cove said he was aware of the difficulty in reusing estates and was trying to encourage such projects for several estates in Glen Cove, including the modernization of Winfield.
"The challenge of these estates is to find a creative use for them that will preserve their historic integrity, generate the funds necessary to keep them going, while at the same time satisfy their neighbors, who don't want their quality of life sacrificed," Mr. Suozzi said.
Some neighbors of Oheka contended that the catering business attracted too much traffic and noise to their streets. Mr. Melius, who is leasing the building from a Japanese company, is asking the town to give the estate the status of a Special Historic Overlay District. The Huntington Town Board approved that classification last year, after the town had rejected Mr. Melius's request for a variance.
If Mr. Melius succeeds under the new ordinance, he could proceed with his plan for a luxury spa. The application includes 19 self-imposed restrictions, including 8 traffic-related conditions, that he worked out with the Cold Spring Hills Civic Association.
Banfi, too, made an appeal, to the Old Brookville Zoning Board for reclassification when it changed Rynwood to offices in 1979.The request met with little resistance, said Robert Whiting, estate and vineyard manager of the 127-acre property.
That experience may suggest that Long Island communities are becoming more aggressive in preserving history and making the zoning adjustments to do so.
Heritage tourism is an increasingly profitable part of the travel industry, according to the Travel Industry Association, which says visitors to historic sites spent an average of $688 last year, compared with $425 for all other types of travelers in the United States.
Towns are adding legislation to preserve landmarks. About 25 of the 99 incorporated villages have ordinances to foster preservation of their historic sites. A property-tax law passed in June could increase that number.
"At present, when you improve your property you are assessed at a higher tax rate," Kathie Ridley, a lawyer for the Preservation League of New York State, said. "This acts as a disincentive to preservation."
The new law provides a property-tax exemption to owners of historic homes who preserve the historic characters of their properties. It allows individuals to defer their tax increases for five years and then pay the increases at yearly 20 percent installments for the next five years.
"This new bill," Ms. Ridley said, "is an enabler. It enables individuals to make use of these tax advantages, which is good for everyone in the community. It will add to the tax revenues of the towns and help historic homeowners afford the improvements necessary to preserve these landmarks."
 
Many Preserved Estates Find Uses in Glen Cove
 The following is a partial listing of mansions in Glen Cove:
Killenworth -- Constructed circa 1912 by the architectural firm of Trowbridge and Ackerman for George du Pont Pratt, son of the Standard Oil magnate Charles Pratt; now owned and used by the Russian Mission to the United Nations.
 Elsinor -- Built before 1873, it was the home of Samuel Latham Mitchill Barlow, a wealthy railroad lawyer and art collector. The estate was acquired by E. R. Ladew, owner of the Ladew Leather Belting factory in Glen Cove in the early 1900's.
The Manor -- Constructed in 1910, it was the estate of John and Ruth Pratt and designed by Charles Adam Platt; it is now the Harrison Conference Center.
Pembroke -- Built by Joseph Raphael Delamar, who made millions in gold and silver mining. After Delamar's death in 1918, it was acquired by Marcus Loew, operator of a national chain of movie theaters and one of the founders of MGM Studios.
Cobble Court -- Constructed in 1927 for Louis and Kate Luckenbach. It has a commanding view of Long Island Sound. It is privately owned.
Poplar Hill -- Built in 1917 for Frederick B. Pratt, son of Charles Pratt; designed by William and Jeffery Platt, son of Charles Platt. It is now the Glengariff Nursing Home.
Webb Institute -- Constructed in 1912 for Herbert L. Pratt by the architect James Brite and the landscape architect James Leal Greenleaf. It is now owned by the Webb Institute for Naval Architecture.
Powell House -- Built in 1946 for Francis and Florence Pratt Powell. It is still privately owned.
Bucknall House -- Constructed in the late 19th century for H. W. J. Bucknall.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Gerard T. Breitner;
Setting the Right Course for Retirement

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG 

 BODY:
"AMERICANS have fallen in love with mutual funds, but beware," cautioned Gerard T. Breitner, president of Excomp Asset Management, a Manhattan-based financial planning concern that uses mutual funds exclusively to create investment portfolios.
Over the past five years, Mr. Breitner said, thousands of mutual funds have come to the marketplace, giving investors much more choice. Yet, selecting from all of these funds can be confusing, he cautioned, and investors need to know what is in these funds, and if there are hidden fees, to avoid investment disasters. 
 Mr. Breitner founded Excomp in 1982. The company currently oversees $60 million in client assets. He is also the host of "The Mutual Fund Report," a four-year-old radio show that airs Mondays at 7 P.M. on Long Island's WGBB (1240 AM), where he interviews top mutual fund managers and answers listener questions live on the air.
Mr. Breitner has worked in the financial services industry since 1974. He earned a bachelor's degree from St. John's University and a master's in financial services from the American College. He is a certified financial planner, a chartered financial consultant and a member of the Estate Planning Council of New York.
He and his wife, JoAnn, live in Rockville Centre. They have one daughter.
Q. You say the mutual fund industry is booming partly because people aren't prepared for retirement?
A. There are some major changes happening in our society today. Baby boomers are shifting from being consumers to being savers and investors. I think they hear the footsteps of retirement off on the horizon, and it's creating a dramatic change in the way they spend their money. Therefore, there's a tremendous flow of money into mutual funds, and a slow-down in the shopping binges they went on in the 1970's and 80's, and the real-estate explosion that occurred when they bought their homes.
However, there have been two studies -- one by Fidelity Funds, the other by Scudder -- which say that most baby boomers' goals for retirement are on a collision course with what they're actually saving and investing. They view retirement as playing on the golf course, spending time with the grandchildren, living half the year in Florida and half the year here. But saving for retirement is something you've got to do all along.
Q. Should people start saving for retirement as soon as they enter the work force?
A. Yes. One of the biggest secrets to a successful retirement is to start saving early. Another is to invest well. But saving early can even make up for investment mistakes.
Q. Is this a realistic expectation when people are faced with high living expenses, caring for children and elderly parents, etc.?
A. There are lots of temptations not to save-- putting the kids through college, keeping up with the Joneses, etc., and I don't pretend to have the answer for each individual case. But I think people need to pay themselves first. They need a strategy. They need to make sure they're taking care of their 401k plans and saving a little on top of that. If you want to spend the rest, then that's O.K. But pay yourself first.
Q. You say the notion of retirement has changed dramatically from just a generation ago?
A. Most people are going to spend a third of their life in retirement. We used to view this as sitting in our rocking chairs. Now, people consider retirement a very active part of life, a transitional phase where they've got more time to do the things they like. And that takes money. It's funny; I have clients in their early 80's who still play singles tennis. I don't ever remember seeing anything like that before.
Q. How does one go about creating a portfolio for a comfortable retirement?
A. You need to set specific goals and have a specific plan. It's not just a question of saving; you need to know what you're saving for and whether you're accumulating enough. You need checks and balances to know where you're going. People can do this on their own. More often than not, though, I think you need help from someone who can be objective, a professional who knows how to deal with taxes, inflation, etc.
Q. Are you a proponent of asset allocation?
A. Asset allocation and diversification are wonderful tools to help reduce the risk of investing. There are 8,000 mutual funds out there. Sometimes, people own 10 or 12 funds and think they are diversified when, in fact, a lot of the funds own some of the same kinds of holdings. You really need to what kinds of things are in the funds and who the manager is. Have an eyeball-to-eyeball meeting with the manager, see if he or she is focused on and passionate about what they do. Since a lot of funds are similar, statistically, you're likely to do better with a fund manager who loves what he is doing.
Q. What advice do you have for investors trying to select mutual funds?
A. You have to be wary of what I call "rear-view mirror investing." If you want to drive to a particular destination and you only look in the rear-view mirror, you're not going to have much success. And, I think using past performance as the main tool to make your investment decisions is just as futile.
It's important to take a forward perspective. Look at what's happening in the economy, make an assessment as to what Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve might be doing. Then ask yourself, "What kinds of funds do I want to own based on what's happening in the economy in the next 6 to 12 months?"
Q. Is investing in mutual funds -- or the stock market in general -- too risky for some people?
A. The bigger risk is not being invested, particularly for the long-term. I consider 65-year-olds as still having a long-term horizon, based on the fact that their life expectancy is probably another 20 to 25 years. The biggest risk is being too conservative, because inflation really annihilates conservative investments like CD's and bonds.
Q. You're somewhat skeptical of major mutual fund families. Why?
A. There are 8,000 mutual funds, and a good fund family might have 60 or 80 choices. If you restrict yourself to one particular fund, you're really only using about 1 percent of the choices that are available to you. And, you're not choosing from the best 1 percent; you're choosing from the 1 percent that has a particular brand or fund name on it. Each fund has a couple of good choices. The rest become mediocre, and some are downright "dogs." So, to the extent that you're moving around within one particular fund family, you're going to wind up with mediocre performance in your portfolio.
Q. Why do you prefer mutual funds over high-performing individual stocks?
A. There are a number of reasons. Funds today allow you to diversify more effectively than individual stocks, international funds and real-estate securities. Secondly, and equally as important, a mutual fund, being broad-based and diversified, will tend to be less volatile and risky than individual stocks or bonds. Since the market's been good, people are kind of lulled into a sense that there's no risk involved in being an investor. But, we've seen much more volatility in 1997 than in the two years previous. We stress to our clients that they need to have a specific strategy so that, when periods of volatility and down markets occur, they won't lose sight of the long-term picture, panic and make some bad investment decisions.
And, it's not just investors who panic -- the professionals can too -- which is why it's important to have a definitive strategy from the very start.
Q. What strategy do you recommend?
A. We take a three-pronged approach: we use a buy and hold strategy, a market-timing strategy and a sector rotation strategy, which means investing in different sectors of the market, i.e., utilities, technology, bonds, etc. We combine them to try and get the benefits of each without the down sides.
Q. You don't put a lot of client investments into bonds. Why?
A. I look at portfolios as being like daisies. The core funds -- the funds you want to hold for three to five years -- are the center of the daisy. The "petals" are other groups of funds you're using to try and add some performance over the short-term -- to add some zip in good markets and some stability in bad ones. I see bonds as being out on the petals, rather than in the core, because I believe they have as much risk as stocks but nowhere near as much of the upside.
Q. Why do you prefer "no-load" funds?
A. The world is global today. It's moving very fast. Commissions kind of stick people's feet in concrete; they prevent them from being proactive with their portfolios. No-load funds allow you to move about fairly freely.
Q. What are the greatest concerns of your clients?
A. Clients don't have a good sense of what risk is all about. We've done studies on human behavior and investing, and most people aren't necessarily rational about their portfolios from a risk standpoint.
If people are given a choice between something that's a sure gain or a chance to win more, overwhelmingly, they choose the sure gain. But, when given a choice between paying a traffic fine or gambling on being assessed a much greater fine, they usually take the chance of paying the higher fine. Risk aversion seems to apply only in the gain dimension; in the loss dimension, most people aren't risk-takers. Statistically, people view losses as being 2 to 2 1/2 times more painful than gains are pleasurable.
Investing isn't necessarily trying to get the greatest of gains. I think it's about taking the least amount of risk, while trying to have your portfolio and investments help you achieve your financial goals. They need a strategy to figure out the least amount of risk they can take for their plan to be effective.

HEADLINE: Off-Year Elections Handicap Challengers

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
TAD SCHARFENBERG, Democratic candidate for Suffolk County District Attorney, called a news conference this month to outline his 10-point plan to change the prosecutor's office.
Mr. Scharfenberg detailed his plan and attacked the incumbent, James M. Catterson Jr., a Republican, as an out-of-control bully so fearsome that would-be contributors to Mr. Scharfenberg's campaign had been scared off. "He is the most despised elected official in county history because of his abuses of power," Mr. Scharfenberg said. 
 Two reporters, and no cameras, were on hand. Little news resulted.
As a lackluster campaign season winds up, candidates for Long Island offices, including Nassau County Executive and the District Attorneys in Suffolk and Nassau, are again resigned to paying for advertising on television and radio and in print for a yawning public in an off-year election.
Once again candidates who spend the most are making their impression, while those with limited resources struggle to avoid virtual anonymity or the ignominy of having their image cast in negative advertising.
In the top Nassau race County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, has been expecting to raise more than $3 million in his campaign for a third term. The Democratic challenger, Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay, said he hoped to raise $225,000.
By the end of last month Mr. Gulotta had spent more than $700,000 on television advertising. The frequency of his ads has picked up as the election nears. "For every one I have," Mr. Yevoli said, "he will have 30."
In one ad on cable television in Nassau and on broadcast television in New York City, Mr. Gulotta speaks about his record as a tax cutter. "Working together," he says, "we've cut and frozen general county property taxes for five years in a row. This year we are cutting taxes again."
Mr. Yevoli pointed out that the ad did not mention questions raised this month by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall about $100 million in revenues in Mr. Gulotta's proposed $2 billion budget for next year. The projection, which enabled Mr. Gulotta to propose a small property-tax cut for 1998, includes $16 million for the county's anticipated share from a yet-to-be approved nationwide settlement in the tobacco case.
The ad also does not mention that in 1991, in a period of fiscal crisis, Mr. Gulotta proposed a 25 percent property-tax increase for 1992.
Mr. Yevoli said an attack on Mr. Gulotta's budgetary tomfoolery was a cornerstone of his campaign. He said the county had a current budget deficit of up to $50 million that would grow larger next year under Mr. Gulotta's proposal.
He also said Mr. Gulotta should be blamed for an increase in county debt from $1.1 billion to $2.5 billion during his years in office. "There is nothing that has happened in that 10-year period that can justify a more than doubling of county debt, nothing," said Mr. Yevoli. But he said that without additional advertising it was "difficult to get people to focus on something like the Nassau County budget and county debt when they are struggling to survive and have mortgages to pay."
Mr. Yevoli said he was swamped by Mr. Gulotta's advertising. "No matter when you turn the television on," he said, "there's a Gulotta commercial. You can't go down a street in Nassau without seeing a Gulotta sign. Every Nassau County bus has a Gulotta sign on it, every rail trestle. It's like Big Brother."
"It's not exactly a level playing field. It's gotten to the point where you have to say, 'Hey, come on, that's not what it's all about.' "
Mr. Gulotta's campaign said Mr. Yevoli was complaining because he was being outmatched by a better candidate. "The real reason Tom Gulotta's opponent is having a tough time running for county executive is that Tom Gulotta is a widely popular county executive who has cut taxes, cut crime and created jobs," said the campaign director, Michael E. Marr.
Mr. Gulotta is also the candidate of one of the most powerful Republican organizations in the country, and is running in a county where Republicans hold a 3-to-2 enrollment advantage among registered voters.
One ad was doing more than giving Mr. Yevoli the name and face recognition that he had gained by shaking an estimated 40,000 hands at railroad stations, shopping centers and local events. Entitled "Cheesy" by Mr. Gulotta's campaign, the ad depicts Mr. Yevoli as a tax raiser and big spender of tax money for questionable purposes and his own enrichment.
"Lew Yevoli knows exactly what to do with your money," the narrator says. "Spend it."
The ad says Mr. Yevoli "voted to spend $175,000 on a cheese museum," voted 66 times to raise his own pay, voted 25 times to raise taxes and "even voted for the largest tax increase in New York history."
The presentation features a photograph of Mr. Yevoli that makes him appear ratty and disreputable. "Cheese museums, big pay raises, huge tax increase, that's Lew Yevoli," the narrator ends.
The ad offers no time frame and does not make clear that Mr. Yevoli cast his vote for a cheese museum in Rome, upstate, in 1988, when Mr. Yevoli was an assemblyman. The museum was a so-called member item that Assembly members routinely approve.
Nearly all the votes that the ad refers to were made when Mr. Yevoli was in the Assembly. The votes he was said to have cast for tax increases and higher salaries could not be confirmed.
Another Gulotta ad based on "Jeopardy" warns, "Lew Yevoli puts Nassau's taxpayers in jeopardy," and shows a photograph of Mr. Yevoli.
Experts in political advertising say negative ads use rivals' photos to create unpleasant associations.
Mr. Yevoli's more limited ad campaign began in the summer with a scattering of ads on cable television on the Island and on broadcast stations in New York City. It focused on the disparity between financing for the two campaigns.
"Don't let Tom Gulotta and the G.O.P. bosses buy this election," it said.
Mr. Yevoli said last week that Mr. Gulotta's campaign had been enriched by contributions from "anyone who has done work for the county," including consultants and contractors, adding, "There is also not a county commissioner who has not made a contribution."
"The man has $3 million to spend on the election," Mr. Yevoli said. "It's obscene. What it says is that you can't even consider running for the highest office in this county unless you have a million bucks to spend."
The executive director of Common Cause in New York State, Rachel Leon, said such disparities between incumbents and challengers were typical. "It's all too familiar," Ms. Leon said. "It's what we are seeing at the state and national level, this incredible incumbent advantage. It is really unfortunate that it comes down to how much money you have."
Ms. Leon said the need for large sums to challenge incumbents meant that challengers faced "an uphill battle unless they are bought out by special interests or are independently wealthy."
In Suffolk, Mr. Scharfenberg started a negative campaign last week that urged voters to "end the Catterson reign of terror."
"I'm putting all my money into radio and TV," he said.
But with hopes of raising a total of $50,000 for his campaign, Mr. Scharfenberg has little to spend.
Mr. Catterson, a widely recognized figure, is running with all the advantages that a Republican incumbent enjoys in a heavily Republican county.
The Suffolk Republican Committee, which is financing the campaign, expects to spend more than $300,000 on the effort, according to a spokesman, Alan F. Eysen. "The party has always strongly supported him," Mr. Eysen said. "We would be foolish not to give all our support to the person at the top of the ticket."
In the absence of stiff competition, Mr. Catterson's ads have ignored the challenger's allegations of abuse and concentrated on portraying Mr. Catterson as a proven crime fighter.
"District Attorney James Catterson," says a 30-second ad that shows a close-up of Mr. Catterson on the job. "Tough. Honest. Doing the job of fighting drugs and keeping criminals behind bars."
Mr. Scharfenberg's ad paints a different picture. "First he said that he would not prosecute every man who belts his wife across the face," says the ad, showing an unflattering photo of Mr. Catterson and referring to a comment that he made in his campaign four years ago.
The ad also says Mr. Catterson "threatened to haul county officials in front of a grand jury if they didn't end the car-lease scandal investigation." That refers in part to allegations by four former and current county officials that Mr. Catterson had threatened them with subpoenas. Mr. Catterson has denied those contentions.
The ad suggests that the District Attorney should investigate Mr. Catterson. "The problem is he is the district attorney," it continues, showing another unflattering photo of Mr. Catterson.
The ad cuts to a photo of Mr. Scharfenberg and ends: "End the Catterson reign of terror by electing Tad Scharfenberg Suffolk D.A."
Mr. Scharfenberg's campaign began running a radio ad last week with virtually the same text. "These ads are hard hitting and they are the truth," he said. "And with Catterson the truth is enough."
The prosecutor's race in Nassau has been mild by comparison, in fact nearly invisible. The Democratic challenger, Jon S. Kaiman, a defense lawyer, said he planned no radio or television ads.
"It's a low-finance campaign," Mr. Kaiman said. "Basically it's a grass-roots effort. We're going door to door and to train stations. It's not a year when people are particularly interested in politics. The economy is good. Crime is down. People are not angry."
The incumbent, Denis Dillon, a Republican, plans to spend $25,000 on radio and television ads. The ads depict a highly professional prosecutor whose office has one of the highest conviction rates in the country. There is no reference to Mr. Kaiman.
Mr. Dillon is seeking a seventh term.
Mr. Kaiman, who said he would raise far less than $25,000, added that he appreciated the restraint that Mr. Dillon had shown in his spending on advertising. "At least," Mr. Kaiman said, "to his credit he is not going to spend a million to try to shape some image just for the sake of it."

HEADLINE: Will Huskies Embrace Big Time Football?

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
CAN a state that has embraced the University of Connecticut's successful men's and women's basketball teams with a passion develop a similar mania for a bigtime football team on a campus football crowds of 10,000 are a struggle?
It will be at least a few years before that can be determined. But barring unexpected opposition from the state legislature, the university appears on the verge of building a new football stadium on the Storrs campus that will accommodate a Husky team that will, by 2003, be playing the likes of Miami and Syracuse as a full-fledged member of the Big East football conference. 
 With the backing of Gov. John G. Rowland, the university's trustees, by a vote of 16 to 1, has approved an upgrade of the football program from I-AA to I-A and recommended that a 35,000-seat stadium be built on campus and not in Hartford, as the House Speaker Thomas Ritter and some others had suggested. Mr. Rowland has said he would call for a one-day special session of the legislature in November to authorize bonding for the stadium, which is expected to cost about $106 million. If that is approved, as expected, construction would begin next year and the stadium would be ready for play by the start of the 2000 season.
Why a move to bigtime college football by a school where the sport traditionally has stirred little interest and has cost the university more than $2 million a year in losses? Certainly it is not because of a winning tradition; UConn football has had only two winning seasons in the last six years. And it is not because of larger crowds at the 16,200-seat Memorial Stadium, which has been filled to capacity only once in 35 years.
Primarily, UConn is making the move to Division I-A (the highest level of collegiate football) to protect the Division I-A status of its basketball teams. A secondary reason appears to be to attract more national attention to the university, something that basketball accomplished to an extraordinary degree in the 1990's.
"There is a reconstructuring of the National Collegiate Athletic Association currently going on," said the university president, Philip E. Austin, in an interview, "and in order to continue playing in the Big East Conference in basketball, we may have to also play at the top level in football. And the UConn basketball program must be protected." Lew Perkins, the university's athletic director since 1990, has been hinting for years that basketball's status might be jeoparized if football were not upgraded. Mr. Perkins, who previously was the athletic director at two Division I-A schools, Maryland and Wichita State, has warned that schools in some major sports conferences, like the Big East, might form a "super tier" exclusive of the N.C.A.A. If that happened, Mr. Perkins has said, schools that are Division I-A in only one major sport, as is UConn, could be left out.
"All kinds of things can happen," he said. "Whoever would have thought that the Southwest Conference, one of the strongest in the country, would have gone out of business and that Brigham Young University would win a national championship and then find itself without a conference?"
Not everyone shares Mr. Perkins or Dr. Austin's fears that a football upgrade is needed. "The argument that if we don't go Division I-A in football we will be kicked out of the Big East in basketball is bogus," said Allen M. Ward, a professor emeritus of history at the university.
Apparently Villanova University shares Dr. Ward's sentiments. Like UConn, Villanova is a member of the Big East basketball conference but in football plays in the I-AA Atlantic 10 Conference. Also like UConn Villanova was invited to join the Big East football conference by Dec. 31 at the latest. But the school, a major football power before it de-emphasized the sport in the 1950's, announced earlier this month that it had declined the invitation. Its Wildcats were unbeaten through the first six games of this season and ranked No. 1 in the latest poll of Division I-AA football teams.
What makes the UConn move all the more surprising to some observers is the expense. During at least the first few years of its existence in I-A, the program would cost approximately $2 million more than the current $2.2 million-a-year football losses, according to a projection by Roy Kramer, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference who, at the university's request, drew up an implementation plan for the upgrade.
The increased cost is attributable to an additional 22 football scholarships (from the current 63 to 85), the addition of three more coaches and a variety of support services, including improved practice fields and weight rooms. But according to the Kramer report, the costs can then be expected to decline each year and that UConn, "with some degree of success on the field, can develop adequate revenue streams within 8 to 10 years to cover the overall cost of a Division I-A program."
Dr. Austin conceded that the UConn football program would continue to lose money, at a rate of about $2 million a year in his estimation, after it moves up to Division I-A. "But after five or six years, we believe that we would show a profit," he said.
And in the long run, it can sometimes cost a school less to fund a Division I-A football team than one at the Division I-AA level. Temple University, for example, has managed to avoid losing money on football in recent years, according to the athletic director, Dave O'Brien, even though the Owls have not posted a winning record since 1990 and have been averaging less than 10,000 people at home games, all of which are played off campus at Veterans Stadium or at Franklin Field in Philadelphia.
"We still break even -- even with all of those empty seats -- because of revenue sharing from the Big East and money from the N.C.A.A., along with money from television and corporate sponsors," Mr. O'Brien said.
But Temple has a long tradition in Division I-A football, marked by many successful seasons in years gone by.
Invariably, schools moving up to Division I-A have been extremely successful on the field in Division I-AA, have had strong followings and already have stadiums that seat at least 30,000, the minimum capacity for a Division I-A school.
For example, Marshall University of Huntington, W. Va., which was elevated to I-A this year, averaged 22,000 spectators last season when it won its second Division I-AA national championship (the first was in 1992). Marshall also had finished as runnerup in 1987, 1991, 1993 and 1995. Connecticut, by comparison, has never qualified for the national playoffs.
That raises the question of whether a Division-I UConn can really draw spectators to Storrs, 22 miles east of Hartford and a two-hour drive from lower Fairfield County. Even Dr. Austin conceded that "football has not been very big historically in New England." And Mr. Perkins, the athletic director, noted that the state is not renown as an incubator of football talent. "We definitely would have to recruit all over the country," Mr. Perkins said.
The UConn athletic department has had strong support for the move to I-A from Lewis Rome, a prominent alumnus, former state legislator and chairman of the university's board of trustees when that body recommended the upgraded. And Harry Hartley, Mr. Austin's predecessor as the university president and an ardent supporter of UConn varsity sports programs, also favored the upgrade.
Dr. Austin acknowledges the opposition of some, including some faculty members, within the UConn community. "Some academic purists do not find the argument that we upgrade to Division I-A in football persuasive," he said. But he said he felt that, in addition to generating "more excitment" among students and alumni, the elevation to Division I-A would create more interest in the university around the country.
"That has happened with basketball, and I'm sure football would make us even better known," Dr. Hartley said. "We would be able to attract the very best in students."
But opposition at Storrs remains strong. "We go into this with a lot of serious handicaps," said Peter Barth, a professor of economics who previously taught at Ohio State, which represents the quintessence of big-time collegiate football.
"First, the university has no football tradition. Second, we've never gone to a national tournament in the sport. Third, it will be a very hard sell to fans, and, fourth, it is not a good business proposal and could be a drag on the entire athletic program. Costs are going to rise substantially, and there could be a lot of losing seasons, particularly at the start."
Professor Barth and some other faculty members also expressed fears that standards might be lowered in order to field a competitive Division I-A football team.
"A critical question here is whether you're going to protect academic programs and not lower standards for football players," said Bruce M. Stave, the chairman of the university's history department. "It's imperative that we not adopt a 'football culture' that could lead to a way of life that we're not proud of. It has to be a clean program and one that we constantly keep an eye on. People have to realize that, above all, this is an academic institution."
Allan Ward, the history professor, said he felt that if a vote were taken among UConn faculty members on the move to Division I-A, "I think they'd vote against it."
"I think the idea is dreadful, and that we have a situation here where the tail is wagging the dog," Dr. Ward said. "By moving into big-time football, you focus the wrong kind of attention on the university and you attract people to the school for the wrong reason. And spending more and more money on football is hard to justify when we've had cutbacks in faculty."
Jason Jakubowski, the editor of the Daily Campus, the student newspaper, said he thought that most students favored the move to Division I-A. "I know some people have reservations about it," said Mr. Jakubowski, a junior from New Britain. "But I think that the national exposure will benefit the university. More quality students will apply for admission. And I don't think the university will allow standards to be lowered for football players."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Red Bank, N.J.;
Reborn Downtown, Century-Old Homes

BYLINE: By JANICE FIORAVANTE 

 BODY:
BETTY THOMPSON is a member of Red Bank's Borough Council, the charter school committee and the school superintendent's partnership committee. "This is a positive, engagement-type community," she said.
Red Bank hugs the Navesink River, separating it from Middletown. Its success in revitalizing its downtown business district in the last seven years has encouraged residents to tackle new challenges. 
 "If you present an idea here that has any merit and adequate advocacy, Mayor McKenna and the council will put 100 percent support behind it," said Tracy Challenger, executive director of RiverCenter, a public-private business alliance that has been instrumental in the Monmouth County town's rebirth.
In January 1994, there were 45 vacancies on the main shopping avenue, Broad Street. "Today, there are three," Ms. Challenger said. Rents have climbed to $14 to $20 a square foot a year from $8 to $10 five years ago.
The downtown has several small districts within a five-block area, Ms. Challenger said, including an antiques district; an arts corridor with galleries and theaters; waterfront parks and hotels, and shopping, restaurants and "little Wall Street," which includes branch offices of Merrill Lynch, Dean Witter and Fahnestock now and will add Smith Barney in January.
Red Bankers are now focusing on challenges like education. "Over the past four to five years, Red Bank schools have not kept pace with the retail renaissance," said J. Michael Rush, Superintendent of Schools. Dr. Rush took over as head of schools in January to address declining test scores.
Red Bank Regional High School has students from Little Silver and Shrewsbury as well as Red Bank, but the former towns' eighth-grade students score in the 90th to 95th percentile in statewide tests, while Red Bank's scores are in the 50th percentile.
The Red Bank school district has classes from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade in two schools. The primary school goes from pre-kindergarten through the third grade and the middle school from the fourth through eighth grades. Of the fewer than 900 students who attend, 60 percent are black, 15 percent Hispanic and the rest white or Asian.
"It's only October and parents are already reporting dramatic changes in attitude and discipline since Dr. Rush has taken over," Mayor Edward J. McKenna Jr. said. "His new team of administrators and new principals for each school have made even the charter school committee want to wait and see what happens with the changes he's implementing."
Dr. Rush has started several programs, including teacher retraining, an adopt-a-class partnership with business and afterschool programs to improve basic skills for grades one to six. "I want business owners to come and talk to students about economic empowerment," he said.
Students here are also served by the St. James elementary school and Red Bank Catholic High. St. James enrolls 560 students in pre-kindergarten to grade eight, with tuition at $2,200 a year. Red Bank Catholic High, with 800 students, costs $4,695 a year. Of last year's graduates, 83 percent went to four-year and 15 percent to two-year colleges. "Our parochial schools draw from 20 communities," said Maureen Hintelmann, director of admissions at the high school and principal of the elementary school. "Of its 560 students, fewer than 150 are from Red Bank."
OF Red Bank Regional High School's 1,050 students, 40 percent come from Red Bank. "We're a magnet school for performing arts and receive students from about 18 other districts," said the principal, Robert Nogueira. Its class of 1997 included 202 graduates, 88 percent of whom went on to college. The performing arts program has classes in dance, drama, creative writing, voice, piano, commercial art and photography.
Jeffrey MacPherson, a real estate agent and lifelong resident of Red Bank, said he was not surprised at how many people come back to Red Bank after college to buy a home and to start a career, partly because of the downtown's revival.
"House prices range from $60,000 for a three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath Colonial in town to $1 million for a four-bedroom house on the river," said Mr. MacPherson, who is with Murphy Realty/Better Homes & Gardens. "Most of our houses are 100-year-old three-to-four bedroom, one-family Victorians and Colonials." Only 8 percent of the homes are multifamily, with most of those two-family.
The condominium/town-house developments are renovations and conversions of high-rise apartment houses on the riverbank or garden apartments. "However, Tower Hill is an example of relatively new building with a Mediterrean-type theme from the 1980's containing 60 two- and three- bedroom multilevel condo units with fireplaces," Mr. MacPherson said. There are no co-op apartments.
An early conversion project, The Bluffs on the River, started out as historic Victorian houses on Front Street, according to Patricia Small, a broker at the William H. Hintelmann agency. "These condos are very special, with such architectural features as wooden floors and mouldings, cathedral ceilings and brickwork and a widow's walk, as well as panoramic views of the Navesink," she said. The two- , three- and four-bedroom units range from $375,000 to more than $500,000.
Another former apartment house on the river is now a retirement community called the Navesink House.
"It's an extended-care facility where a one-bedroom apartment goes for $80,000 and long-term care is available on the premises," Mr. MacPherson said. "It's gorgeous, with a great banquet hall, and was renovated 10 years ago."
He added, "There's an influx of out-of-towners, college students and older families that has meant a very competitive rental market." Monmouth University is 15 minutes away.
Both Mr. MacPherson and Geoff Brothers of Brothers Commercial Realty described the mixed-use buildings downtown as popular among renters. Downtown buildings tend to have retail space on the ground floor, office space on the second and residential rentals on the third. "People like to be right downtown -- there's a vibrancy and community feeling," Mr. Brothers said.
Deborah Marks was born and raised in Red Bank and came back after four years away to live and start her own business, DD Business Forms. "It's been exciting to be here and see the changes," she said. "And it's continuing." She cited a microbrewery based in Princeton called Triumph that is gutting a storage building in Red Bank and a customer of hers who just opened a new theater, the Royale.
But many other residents explain their love of Red Bank by starting with, "I came from New York City. . . ."
Ara Hovnanian said that Red Bank attracted New Yorkers because of "its suburban beauty while being a little walking downtown city." Mr. Hovnanian is president of K. Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., the largest homebuilder in the state, with headquarters on the Navesink River. "And while we've been located here for 20 years, none of our building goes on here," he said. "There is virtually no land in Red Bank to build on -- the just-closed Woolworth's is about the biggest available space."
MS. MARKS described Red Bank as a city without the city. "Ten minutes away is the closest beach, Sea Bright, and there are beautiful parks along the river," he said. The 2.3-acre Marine Park is the site of RiverFest, a three-day jazz, blues and food festival every June and one of many special events that help bring 500,000 visitors to town each year.
Perhaps jazz and Red Bank are inevitable. Count Basie was born and raised here -- as William James Basie at 229 Mechanics Street. Basie remembered his hometown when he recorded the "Red Bank Boogie." He was honored after his death in 1984 with the renaming of the old Carlton Theater, now the 1,400-seat Count Basie Theater. The New Jersey Symphony as well as dance and theater groups and popular performers like Steve Winwood perform there.
The theater, the park festival and the renewed downtown all draw visitors, but Red Bank's riverfront location has been its ticket to growth since the 1600's. Farmers had access to New York markets via sloops and schooners, with steamboats helping to bring residents and commerce between the 1830's and 1850's. By the 1860's, the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad helped further expansion, sparking the town's industrial boom.
The Galleria, a minimall in an old factory building, includes one of the town's first coffeehouses, The House of Coffee, as well as a dance studio called Steppin' Out and such stores as Makin' Good Scents, with scented candles, oils and potpourri, and restaurants like 2 Senza, serving Italian food and wines.
Evening entertainment, like jazz at the Downtown Cafe or comedy shows at the Internet Cafe, in addition to the theaters, restaurants and shops make Red Bank a destination for people in the region. "People drive a half hour to come here for entertainment," Ms. Challenger said. "It's fun to be part of the rebirth," Mrs. Thompson. added

HEADLINE: A 'New' Kennedy Airport Takes Wing

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
THE INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS BUILDING, heart of the Terminal City complex at John F. Kennedy International Airport, whose swooping entry arch ushered New York into the jet age, is about to turn 40. And a special event is planned for its anniversary year.
It's going to be demolished.
Replacing it will be the $1.2 billion, 16-gate International Air Terminal, or Terminal 4, which is to be completed in 2001. Although a ceremonial groundbreaking is planned next month, the ground outside the old terminal has already been broken wide open, as crews dig utility trenches and sink foundations. The rhythmic pounding of pile drivers on the construction site is so loud that only the roar of the Concorde drowns them out. 
 Travelers will not have to wait three years, however, to find a thoroughly contemporary terminal at Kennedy Airport. The $435 million, 11-gate Terminal 1 is to open in seven months where the Eastern Airlines terminal stood. It is the first new passenger building in 27 years, since British Airways (then BOAC) opened Terminal 7.
The British Airways terminal itself is undergoing a $143 million renovation that began last month.
All told, some $2.7 billion will be invested at Kennedy Airport in the next five years, said the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, on top of $2.6 billion that has been spent since 1990. Much of the money to date has gone into realigned roadways and new utilities. Though vital, this is not as obvious as a new passenger terminal.
"One thing that is not too well understood is that J.F.K. is undergoing a complete reconstruction from the ground up," said Barry Abramowitz, general manager of Port Authority's aviation capital program. "At the end, we will have produced a brand-new Kennedy Airport."
It will certainly take that kind of effort to mitigate Kennedy's reputation among travelers as one of the least welcoming airports in the world. The sense of hopelessness deepened in 1990 when the ambitious plan known as J.F.K. 2000, which called for an enormous central terminal, was scuttled, leaving as its legacy a $21 million baggage-handling system known as the "tunnel to nowhere."
What has permitted the current wave of construction and renovation is an infusion of private investment, which the Port Authority said accounts for 47 percent of all capital spending at Kennedy between 1990 and 2002.
"The idea of privatization is catching on," said John A. Cavanagh, chief operating officer of Morse Diesel International, the construction manager for all three terminal projects, which are largely financed with private money.
Terminal 1 is being developed by a consortium of four foreign-flag carriers: Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Lufthansa German Airlines. Terminal 4 is being developed by Schiphol U.S.A., a subsidiary of the Dutch company that runs Schiphol, the Amsterdam airport; LCOR, a New York-based real estate concern that produced the master plan for the relocation of Amtrak's Penn Station operations into the General Post Office and the investment banking house of Lehman Brothers.
Like any privately owned commercial buildings, Terminals 1 and 4 will be competing aggressively for tenants; in this case, airlines.
While their developers emphasize differences, the buildings have numerous common elements. For example, shopping malls and food courts are the order of the day. Since international travelers have to arrive earlier than ever to clear security, they can spend hours at an airport. That is an attractive captive audience.
Both new terminals adhere to an understated esthetic that is gradually replacing the World's Fair variety of the original Terminal City, where architects outdid one another with eye-catching three-dimensional billboards. The new style -- call it Airfoil Modern -- is characterized by rooflines as gently bowed as the top of an aircraft's wing and silvery surfaces as smooth as a fuselage skin.
Both designs emphasize direct routes from check-in to boarding, via retail areas. Glass walls allow passengers to see the aircraft, orient themselves quickly and chart their paths without need of complex signage.
Even in its raw structural state, Terminal 1 is striking. Its check-in hall, almost long enough to fit three 747's head to tail, is covered by a canopy of curving, branching steel members 50 feet overhead. Check-in counters are clustered in islands, rather than being arrayed as a solid wall, lending a sense of permeability to the space.
William Nicholas Bodouva & Associates are the architects of Terminal 1. Terminal 4 was designed by TAMS Consultants, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Ove Arup & Partners. The Terminal 7 renovation is by Corgan Associates and Ove Arup.
British Airways is investing $100 million in the Terminal 7 renovation, financed through the sale of bonds by the New York City Industrial Development Agency, and the Port Authority is spending $43 million on related roadway work. Key features are expanded check-in and retail areas, new lounges and a new parking decks.
Other projects at Kennedy include a $46 million boomerang-shaped parking garage, with 1,430 short-term spaces, across from Terminal 1 and the Delta Airlines terminals. It is scheduled to be completed next May, in time for the opening of Terminal 1.
New roadways have been completed in front of the American Airlines terminals. Pedestrian islands are sheltered under aluminum canopies on tapered concrete columns. This covered network not only affords protection from the elements but also delineates a clear walkway to the buildings.
Most of the infrastructure has also been redone, said Charles G. Seliga, acting general manager of Kennedy. "But nobody sees it," he said. "It's underground." The utility systems and roadways were designed to handle 15 million passengers a year, Mr. Abramowitz said, and staggered under the demands of 31 million. The new systems are meant to serve 45 million passengers a year.
Four new cargo centers, ranging in cost from $16 million to $100 million, are being built around the airport by Korean Air, United Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Air Express International. Almost inconspicuously from the passengers' viewpoint, some 1.7 million tons of cargo, worth about $94 billion, passes through Kennedy each year.
All four cargo buildings were financed through the sale of bonds, totaling $202 million, by the Industrial Development Agency, administered by the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
"The Port Authority's attention has been focused on making air cargo grow at Newark," said Charles Millard, president of the corporation. "This has required the city to make sure air cargo gets the attention it deserves and has not received from the Port Authority at J.F.K."
Fighting words, to be sure, but merely the latest in a half century of tense relations between the City of New York, which owns the 4,930-acre property (one-third the size of Manhattan), and the Port Authority, which holds a long-term lease. In 1947, a financially strapped city government ceded control of Idlewild airfield to the authority, which was in a stronger position to develop it. The original 50-year lease would have expired this year but was extended to 2015.
At the dedication in 1948, Mayor William O'Dwyer happily contemplated the day when the city would regain control and he could "thank the Port Authority for the present of this finished airport."
Now, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is proposing a city-state authority that would take over Kennedy no later than 2015.
"The Mayor strongly believes that the city has been shortchanged for quite a long time," said Randy L. Levine, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. "The lease is unfair. We're in litigation. The airports have not been run the way they should be run. We could do a better job."
Robert E. Boyle, executive director of the authority, said in response: "Obviously the Port Authority disagrees with the Mayor on who is best suited to run the airports. As far as the lease goes, we are still ready, willing and able to sit down with the city and strike a new deal."
Complaints by New York City officials that the Port Authority favors Newark are as old as the O'Dwyer administration and as fresh as the opening last year of Newark's International Arrivals Facility and its monorail, which is eventually to be extended to the Northeast Corridor rail line.
But Mark O. Hatfield Jr., director of communications for the authority, said Newark was rebuilt first in part because it was older. He also noted that a new light-rail link between Kennedy and the Howard Beach subway station might be open in four years, about the time that the Newark connection is running. An elevated line from Kennedy along the median strip of the Van Wyck Expressway to the Jamaica rail and subway station may be finished in 2002.
The light-rail system will make a loop around the central terminal area, passing directly through Terminal 4, the International Air Terminal, which will be constructed over and around the rail line.
"We have the famous choo-choo train coming right into our building," exulted Hans Mohrmann, president and chief executive of Schiphol U.S.A.
Schiphol U.S.A. is a subsidiary of N. V. Luchthaven Schiphol, which developed, runs and manages the Amsterdam airport. It has a 40 percent interest in J.F.K. International Air Terminal, a limited liability company formed last year to develop Terminal 4.
A 40 percent interest is held by a subsidiary of LCOR, formerly Linpro, which has developed some 13 million square feet of office space, including the Federal building at 290 Broadway in lower Manhattan and the 101 Hudson Street tower in Jersey City. The other 20 percent is held by a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings.
The developers have subleased a 165-acre site from the Port Authority and taken over management of the arrivals hall and flanking departure gates, from which 50 international carriers operate. (The flanking structures were once formally designated the Foreign-Flag Airline Wing Buildings but the whole complex is now commonly called the International Arrivals Building.)
In the existing wings, check-in, ticketing, baggage handling, security and waiting areas are repeated every several hundred feet. "The I.A.B. is actually six smaller terminals, which is terribly inefficient," said Ted D. Kleiner, program director for redevelopment at Kennedy Airport.
WITH 1.5 million square feet of space, the new building will actually be slightly smaller than the existing structure. But the essential functions will be shared by the airlines, making for greater efficiency. Tenants that sign up for the longest leases, 10 to 15 years, will get preference in the allocation of check-in counters and boarding gates.
Beyond the check-in hall in the headhouse, as the main part of the terminal is called, will be a 1,000-foot-long shopping mall and food court, with design elements like a clock tower or topiary to conjure the neighborhoods and landmarks of New York.
The east concourse will have six gates and the west concourse 10 gates. The structure can be expanded incrementally to as many as 37 gates as the market demand warrants, said Kurt M. Eichler, executive vice president and principal of LCOR.
Construction is being financed through the sale of $934 million in bonds by the Port Authority, together with investment earnings of $125 million and developer equity of $15 million. In addition, the Port Authority is reinvesting $124 million of the terminal rental into the project.
"There were constraints in terms of amortization because of the underlying city lease," Mr. Eichler said. Bonds that are due to mature between the years 2017 and 2025 will be subject to a special mandatory redemption in 2015 if the city has not renewed the Port Authority's overall lease.
With the existing building in operation, construction will begin on the new headhouse and west concourse. Six months later, a temporary arrivals hall will be built and demolition will begin on the arch. A year later, the west concourse will open. A year later, construction will begin on the east concourse. Seven months later, the headhouse will be finished and demolition will begin on the wing buildings. Eleven months later, the east concourse will be complete and all 16 new gates will be open.
"We've made the commitment that we'll never have less than 10 gates in continuous operation," Mr. Eichler said.
Developers are generally loath to discuss potential tenants publicly until they have been landed, and the Schiphol-LCOR team is no exception. But the bond prospectus notes that the developers have had discussions with United Airlines, which gave up its own building, Terminal 9, in the 1980's and now operates from Terminals 6 and 7.
The prospectus also notes that the departure of four airlines for Terminal 1 should open up capacity that would attract many carriers now in congested quarters elsewhere. Their departure will also open space in which to shift other tenants, making it easier to stage construction of the new building around the existing terminal.
Frustration is what drove Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Lufthansa to an apparently unprecedented collaboration -- carriers from four different nations building on the soil of a fifth.
Even as they chafed in their aging quarters, they had opposed an enormous central terminal as unwieldy and exorbitant. But when that plan was abandoned, so was hope.
"There was no relief or development in sight," said Dieter Bergt of Lufthansa. There was, however, an opportunity: the 36-acre site of the Eastern Airlines terminal.
The airlines formed a limited partnership, Terminal One Group Association. Its general partner is Terminal One Management, in which the airlines have equal shares. Mr. Bergt is chief executive. The executive director Arthur F. McMahon, who formerly managed the Trans World Airlines and British Airways terminals.
The partnership holds a sublease on the property through 2015 from the Port Authority. It is renewable through 2024 if the city extends the authority's lease. However, Mr. McMahon said, the partnership has a separate agreement with the city, also running through 2024, should the authority's overall lease be terminated. Financing came from the sale in 1994 of $435 million in bonds by the Industrial Development Agency.
Terminal 1 has 635,000 square feet of space. The check-in hall has four islands for use by each of the airlines. Beyond that is a two-level rotunda that will be used as the food court. There are eight gates on the south concourse, three on the west, including the Concorde's position, which will be visible from the Van Wyck Expressway.
There is room in the terminal for approximately seven more airlines, Mr. McMahon said, depending on the size of their operations. Tenants will be courted with the idea that the terminal has been constructed by the very companies who use it. "What was brought to the design and functionality of the building is decades of first-hand experience," Mr. Bergt said. "This has been built by airlines for airlines."
Next July 31, two months after Terminal 1 opens, will come the 50th anniversary of the dedication of New York International Airport by President Harry S. Truman and Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York.
"For too long now the existing facilities for air transportation in this area have been saturated," Dewey said, in a sentiment that has outlived the days of the Constellation.
Truman said the airport "will be the front door to the United Nations." But before he could finish his speech, a formation of F-80 jets screamed overhead to begin an hourlong aerial show of 900 fighters, bombers and transports -- the largest peacetime display of American air might.
Like everyone else, Truman called the airport "Idlewild," after a golf course that had stood on the site. Perhaps the only person who abjured that designation was Austin J. Tobin, executive director of the Port Authority. According to a new history of the authority, "Perpetual Motion," Tobin admonished staff members by saying: "It's neither idle nor wild!"
Neither was it much of an airport at first, with a ragtag collection of Quonset huts that The New York Times called "one of the worst terminal buildings in the world." Passengers at Idlewild suffered "physical, mental and emotional indignities which were barely acceptable in the days of the covered wagon," The Times said.
AN astonishing transformation occurred in 1957 with the opening of the International Arrivals Building. Designed in a spare modernist style by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, it sparkled like a new Park Avenue office tower and worked as efficiently as a supermarket, with conveyor belts at the customs inspection stations. Travelers were greeted by a 40-foot Alexander Calder mobile. ("What we kept from the old building was of course the Calder," Mr. Mohrmann said.)
After that came the "unit" terminals of the big American-flag carriers: United and Eastern in 1959, American and Pan American in 1960, Northwest and Trans World in 1962, National in 1969. They were arrayed around a landscaped oval with a fountain, a reflecting pool, three chapels and a see-through heating and cooling plant.
Each was distinctive. The sinuous T.W.A. Flight Center, by Eero Saarinen & Associates, is the best known; indeed, it is an official landmark. Its upraised, intersecting concrete vaults make it look like a giant concrete bird that has glided to a landing.
Equally arresting was the Pan Am Worldport, by Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (predecessors to TAMS), with its elliptical concrete and steel canopy suspended on a network of cables over a glass drum. The National Airlines Sundrome, by I. M. Pei & Partners, had an intricate facade of faceted glass mullions, while the American terminal, by Kahn & Jacobs, had a 317-foot-long stained-glass wall by Robert Sowers.
Idlewild was sensational, recalled Mr. Bergt, who was first stationed in New York for Lufthansa from 1957 to 1972. "After the unit terminals opened, one after the other," he said, "with the fountain, the flower beds, the churches and synagogue, people who came here from Europe and overseas couldn't believe it. This was the model airport."
When the arrivals building opened, Gov. W. Averell Harriman said he hoped the runways could handle moon-bound rocket traffic. But that did not turn out to be the problem. Rather, it was the arrival in 1970 of 400-seat jumbo jets that gravely overtaxed the structure.
"The building for the next 40 years will have to be radically different," said Marilyn Jordan Taylor, a partner at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. She believes this is the first time that a Skidmore-designed icon will be replaced by another Skidmore building.
Having departed on her first overseas voyage as a young girl from the international building, Ms. Taylor allowed that she may feel a twinge of sadness when it comes down. But her regret will be tempered.
"I'm so tired of seeing my city's primary international airport rated the lowest," Ms. Taylor said, "that it stiffens me to say it's clearly time to move on."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
Giving Commercials Their Best Shot

BYLINE: By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
TO David Fitzgerald, New Jersey suburbia essentially breaks down into two basic types: Norman Rockwell and Edward Scissorhands.
Montclair and Tenafly are classic Norman Rockwell towns, with stately colonials on shade-dappled yards, places that evoke a memory of a time when childhood was safe and unhurried. Clifton and Cedar Grove will serve as your basic Edward Scissorhands towns, slightly menacing places where 1960's split-levels gleam unshaded under the midday sun and where the foliage forms perfect geometric shapes. 
 "Norman Rockwell was always the standard for commercials," Mr. Fitzgerald, who scouts locations for television, explains. But lately, that has changed. The Edward Scissorhands towns have been more in vogue. Then there are your gritty urban locations: Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken. And your rural ones, places like Oldwick and Lebanon. Of course, you never know about those rural locations. The way new suburbs spring up these days, last year's great cornfield could be this year's new Edward Scissorhands town.
Whatever. Wherever. New Jersey can, and does, provide the backdrop for almost any scene a film or television director could want. Last year, 69 feature films, 240 commercials and numerous other film projects were shot on location here, contributing $48.2 million to the state's economy, according to the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television Commission.
It's people like David Fitzgerald who find these backdrops. Mr. Fitzgerald, 41, has been scouting locations in the New York area for 15 years. Like many fellow scouts, he fell into his profession accidentally. A painter with a master's degree in fine arts, Mr. Fitzgerald received a call one day from an old friend who had gone to film school and was now working as a location scout. "I was working in an art gallery," Mr. Fitzgerald recalls. "He was making more money."
Experienced location scouts command about $500 a day plus expenses. Beginners earn $200 to $300. At least 100 location scouts work steadily in the New York metropolitan area; Mr. Fitzgerald is one of about 30 who concentrate exclusively on commercials.
It doesn't take a whole lot to get set up in the location scouting business. A sturdy camera, a reliable car, a good set of maps, a beeper, a cellular phone and a few contacts will start you off. But it's up to the location scout to develop a vast database of houses of every architectural style and feel, with occupants willing to put their lives on hold for a few days -- in other words, to create the visual equivalent of a great Rolodex.
And it's up to the location scout to learn which towns are film-friendly and which aren't, and to keep up with changes in local ordinances regarding location shooting.
"A lot of the job is clearance," Mr. Fitzgerald says. "Who will allow you to film, which locations have been film-friendly in the past."
Like most scouts working in the area, Mr. Fitzgerald found himself spending a lot of time in Montclair, a town with a strong collection of houses built in the late 19th century. Mr. Fitzgerald, who was brought up in Manhattan and then moved to Brooklyn, grew to like Montclair so much that he decided to move his own family there in 1995. He and his wife, Naomi Rand, a college professor and writer, chose a yellow Victorian built in 1892, with a glassed-in front porch and a 30-by-30-foot living room -- with an eye toward show business.
"I thought it would work for commercials," he says. "And it does." The house has provided the setting for four commercials, including a Corestates Bank spot currently being broadcast. To avoid the resentment of other residents on his small private street, he has arranged for the production companies to pay the neighbors for parking in their driveways. And after the latest commercial was filmed, Mr. Fitzgerald bought them each a bottle of wine.
With all their trailers and equipment, their habit of tying up traffic and hogging parking spaces, film crews have a way of wearing out their welcome in even the most film-friendly towns. So places like Tenafly and Montclair, which have provided the scenery for more than their share of commercials and movies, are beginning to become restrictive. After a number of film shoots in one of Montclair's tonier neighborhoods last year, irate neighbors pressed the town to pass an ordinance limiting production to three days a year at any single location. Anything more -- say, the day-after-day production required in shooting a feature film -- requires a variance.
When certain towns begin to recede as film towns, others emerge to take their place. Lately, Maplewood has begun to provide some of the Norman Rockwell sets needed by the film business. As word spreads among scouts, Maplewood will begin to get the reputation as a film-friendly town and draw more business, Mr. Fitzgerald explains.
Then there's the magic circle to consider. If a film is shot within a 25-mile radius of Columbus Circle in Manhattan, the production company doesn't have to pay for travel time for the union crew. A scout who wants to be asked again is attentive to that geographic requirement.
IT usually doesn't take much to persuade homeowners to put up with all the chaos involved in a film shoot. For $1,800 to $2,000 a day -- not to mention the flattery of having your house chosen to be on television! or in the movies! -- most homeowners are quite willing to put up with the cameras, cables and caterers that come with job. Farmers, too, are often eager for both the money and the attention. Although some farmers are "sort of old and crotchety and don't want to be bothered," Mr. Fitzgerald says, many enjoy the Hollywood-style intrusion and therefore are called again and again, he says.
Still, part of his job is reminding the property owner what that $2,000 pays for: the right to completely turn your house (or farm or whatever) upside down for a day. "When they come in, they might move furniture," Mr. Fitzgerald recently warned a Montclair homeowner, whose house was being considered for a spot featuring a major brand of sports equipment. To make a real location fit the director's vision, crews may refit light fixtures or replace window treatments. To prepare for a shoot that could scratch a floor, a false floor might be laid down over it. "It's sort of like an invading army," Mr. Fitzgerald says.
That army needs a lot of room, and one of the challenges of Mr. Fitzgerald's job is to find houses big enough to hold all the crew and equipment, but small enough that they won't look like mansions: "big houses that don't read as wealthy as they are." Another challenge is to find offices, shopping districts and schools that can accommodate all the disruption that inevitably comes with a film crew.
After all the logistical requirements have been met, Mr. Fitzgerald can consider the artistic side of his job. "You have to have a sense of what a director will be looking for," he says. "To be willing to understand the director's vision." And there's not a lot of time.
Location scouts usually have two or three days to bring back 10 or 15 possible locations for a commercial shoot. That translates into about 20,000 miles a year on Mr. Fitzgerald's leased 1995 Camry.
On one job last year, for a Three Musketeers candy bar commercial, Mr. Fitzgerald was asked to find an Italian social hall, the kind of place where the Godfather would hang out. The director suggested he watch the movie "Goodfellas" to get the idea.
"I immediately thought of sort of funky places," Mr. Fitzgerald says. First, he got the name of an actual Italian social club in Jersey City from the New Jersey Film Commission. He also visited the Elks' Lodge in Hoboken, as well as the back room of a Hoboken bar with old wooden booths and a tin ceiling. He tried some places in Little Italy in Manhattan, including at least one with Chianti bottles and checkered tablecloths.
But as is so often the case, the director wound up liking a location a little classier than the one he originally described, and the commercial was shot at another Hoboken location provided by Mr. Fitzgerald: the back room of Frankie and Johnny's, an old-fashioned restaurant and bar with classic turn-of-the-century details.
And then there's the hard part of the job, informing people that their kitchens won't be the setting for next spring's Maxwell House commercial after all. "Some people take it very personally," Mr. Fitzgerald says. "People who haven't been approached numerous times. They get excited, and they start assuming it's going to happen."
In that case, Mr. Fitzgerald tries to let them down easy, just as a director would after auditioning, say, an actress who reads well but is just too short for the job. "You say: 'It's not about your house, but they wanted a bigger space," he says. Or: "They wanted whiter walls."

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Some Foresee Revival, Some Ruin Along a Proposed Light-Rail Line

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
Twice a day, from the front window of his dry cleaning shop, Louis Fisher can see Conrail freight trains moving slowly down a single track through downtown Riverside.
"Every time I look at that track, I try to see the light rail on it," Mr. Fisher said. "Light rail is the future of this town, my business and my family." 
 Mr. Fisher, a Riverside native, has watched his town suffer steady economic decline. Then, in January, he heard of New Jersey Transit's proposal to run light-rail commuter trains on a Conrail track linking Trenton and Camden, making at least 15 stops. The first phase of a plan that would ultimately extend to Glassboro and Rowan University in Gloucester County, the $450 million project had the potential, in Mr. Fisher's words, to "do for Riverside what Hi-Speed Line did for Haddonfield."
The Hi-Speed Line, a 45-mile commuter train administered by the Delaware River Port Authority Transportation Company, whisks 41,300 commuters daily through Camden County between Lindenwold and Philadelphia. The line, which opened in 1966, was bitterly opposed by some Haddonfield residents, who feared it would increase crime and decrease property values in one of the richest municipalities in South Jersey. In fact, the Hi-Speed Line has had no identifiable effect on crime, and residential property prices have remained consistently among the region's highest.
In March, Mr. Fisher moved his business from Mount Laurel, Burlington County, to Riverside, where he still lives. "I'm counting on light rail to make people and businesses want to come back to Riverside," Mr. Fisher said. "There's already talk of all kinds of new things planned for downtown. I can't believe anybody would want to fight this."
Since it was announced last November, the proposed Southern New Jersey Light Rail Transit System has had the support of most elected officials whose municipalities would be served by it. Advocates of the elderly and the disabled (who tend to have less difficulty boarding trains than buses) and commuters irritated by the slow pace of existing New Jersey Transit buses in the Delaware waterfront towns have also endorsed it. The light-rail system is considered crucial to a regional Route 130 Corridor revitalization program. It would provide quieter, potentially less polluting transportation to the E-Center, the state aquarium and the Rutgers University campus in Camden, as well to a food distribution center under construction in Florence Township that is to employ 2,500 workers.
Yet the system has strong opponents who say the plan is too expensive, would serve too few residents, might be less efficient than buses and would so decrease the quality of life that they would have to move.
Jim Gross of Riverton, who teaches elementary school in Pemberton Township, said the system would not serve people who live or work along Route 295 in Burlington and Camden Counties.
"We need money spent on alleviating transporation in this region right now," he said, "and instead here comes New Jersey Transit telling us that they're going to spend $450 million so people along the waterfront can get to Camden."
Tom Wood of Pennsauken, whose house backs up to the track New Jersey Transit wants to use, said he would move if the light rail link were established. Increases in noise, pollution from diesel-powered light rail engines and invasions of privacy are "only part of the reason," he said. "The major reason is that I grew up in Haddonfield." That town, he said, benefited more from its school system and historic buildings than from mass transit.
Phyllis R. Elston, New Jersey Transit's community affairs director for the project, dismissed opponents of light rail "as people who just don't have all the facts." Although final approvals are still necessary, she said, money for the project has already been allocated from state gas tax revenues. "So no taxpayer is going to be burdened by this," she said.
"Light rail engines are quieter than buses, less polluting than buses, safer than buses in that they can stop faster and can run in all weather conditions," she said. In addition, "mass transit brings jobs and people to a region, and both are absolutely necessary to revitalize a community." She said the first light-rail trains could be running in four years.
The Democratic gubernatorial candidate, James E. McGreevy, has promised to thwart the project if elected. The town of Delanco also opposes it. A survey of Palmyra residents showed slightly more than half the respondents opposed to the train. And although light rail has been enthusiastically endorsed in Camden, where a light-rail maintenance yard is projected to bring 150 new jobs, Camden Country freeholders have withheld their support.
John Laverty of Riverton, a fast-food restaurant developer who is a member of the Burlington County Citizens Transporation Advisory Council, noted that only three years ago, another proposed South Jersey light-rail link connecting Camden with Moorestown and Mount Holly was defeated. "If South Jersey keeps saying no, North Jersey will take the money and spend it elsewhere," he said. "Light rail might not be everything everybody wants, but without it, things are only going to get worse."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: STUYVESANT COVE;
Park to Grow on the Ashes of the Riverwalk Plan

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
Efforts to revive a desolate stretch of shore on the East River, between 18th and 23d Streets, have themselves been revived.
The redevelopment effort, began in the early 1980's as Riverwalk, a proposed development of luxury apartment towers, marinas, a hotel and offices, has metamorphosed into Stuyvesant Cove, a riverfront park. 
 After Riverwalk was officially scratched in 1992 as a result of fierce neighborhood opposition, talks among city and state politicians and community board members dragged along until last week, when the city's Economic Development Corporation announced a plan for what people seem to agree is better.
"It's proof of what we can accomplish under this mayor," Charles Millard, the president of the E.D.C., said, adding that previous administrations had been unable to field "a team" like his to work on projects like this one and other waterfront developments like Pier A at the Battery, now under reconstruction. "We put together the plan and the money for it," he said of Stuyvesant Cove.
But the new park -- whose financing will come from state, city and federal sources -- is also a pet project of Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who was a leading opponent of Riverwalk.
While praising Mayor Giuliani for cooperating and helping the project, Mr. Sanders said that , "all of the initial work was begun under the Dinkins administration" and that members of Community Board 6 did yeoman's work in putting the idea together over the last several years. "It's really the cooperation of all the local elected officials that's made it possible," he said, mentioning himself and Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff and State Senator Roy M. Goodman, both of whom are Republicans.
Unlike Riverwalk, which would have cut off neighborhood residents from the water, the new park is specifically designed to be "environmentally appropriate," according to E.D.C. plans, and to promote access to now-unused shoreland next to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.
To accomplish those goals and to maximize the park's size, the northbound service road of the F.D.R. Drive will be moved to the west side of the elevated highway, so that the park will begin at the highway's eastern edge. Avenue C will in effect be extended to 23rd Street as a two-way boulevard from its present end at 18th Street, with crossing points at both ends and at 20th Street, and a southbound exit from the Waterside apartment complex just north of the park, to be opened for the first time. Currently, the onlyexit is at 34th Street.
Present plans call for the planting of marsh grass along the waterline and for the building of bicycle and walking paths, Mr. Millard said.
Construction of the park is scheduled to begin early next year, once the rebuilding of the F.D.R. Drive is completed in the area. BERNARD STAMLER

Joy in Mudville: The Resale Value of Minor League Teams

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
THE Quad City River Bandits, a minor league baseball team in Davenport Iowa, are not exactly the stuff of legend. The clubhouse is so small that players have to take turns dressing. The stadium, which seats 5,100, has one men's and one women's restroom (and a 50-cent beer night). And in April the team had among the worst records in baseball -- 3 wins, 15 losses.
And yet, Richard M. Holtzman, the River Bandits' owner, turned the team into the stuff that baseball dreams are made of with two words: for sale. 
 Many a fan has fantasized about owning a team. Maybe the attraction is rubbing elbows with celebrity owners like the comedian Bill Murray or the singer Jimmy Buffett. Maybe it is the desire to have stationery with the "Lansing Lugnuts" letterhead, or a fond regard for the atmosphere of the movie "Bull Durham." Maybe it is the opportunity to watch future major leaguers, or even the hope of big cash returns.
Investors tempted to make any of those dreams a reality can shop for one of the six to eight minor league teams that are sold each year. But team owners warn that would-be baseball moguls should take a long look before stepping up to the plate.
"It's possible to make money, and it's also possible to lose a lot very quickly," said Mike Veeck, owner of five minor league teams, including the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League.
Many team owners have done well on their investments, not necessarily because of ticket sales but because resale values have skyrocketed. "A team that cost $350,000 just 10 years ago costs $8 million today," said Robert D. Richmond of Scottsdale, Ariz., president of the Class A Northwest League, who also owns and brokers minor league teams.
Prices for independent league teams that are not affiliated with major league clubs can run as low as $25,000, for example, in the North Atlantic Baseball League, based in Southampton, N.Y. Prices increase with each step up the league ladder, from rookie league to classes A, AA, and AAA, the step just below the majors. The AAA teams have asking prices of up to $12 million, still low when compared with a major league team like the Los Angeles Dodgers, which is close to selling for $350 million.
Howard J. Darwin, owner of the Class AAA Ottawa Lynx, put the club on the block in August, asking $10 million. He paid $5 million for it as an expansion club in 1993.
Mr. Darwin said the team had been profitable, sometimes making more than $2 million a year, but that much of those profits were passed back to the city of Ottawa, which built the team's new stadium.
At first blush, the economics of the minor leagues seem sweet. Although few teams make TV money, they receive income from tickets, concessions, advertising and team merchandise, while their big-league affiliates underwrite many expenses. The major league teams, which need the minors to develop players, pay all players, managers, coaches and trainers at 156 minor league clubs -- as well as meal allowances, some hotel rooms and spring training.
But a recent agreement shifts more costs to the minors. Next season, they will pay the costs for more than 200 umpires, the cost of uniforms and half the cost of balls and bats. As in the previous contract, the minors also pay for travel and for running the stadium.
Stadium lease deals are the key to profits, and the cause of owner headaches. The major leagues set stadium standards and minor league owners must persuade stadium landlords, usually municipalities, to make improvements. That can lead to friction.
"The current Mayor of Davenport and I are not on each other's Christmas list," said Mr. Holtzman, who said he was selling his team because Davenport would not make an estimated $6 million of stadium improvements required by the league. Without improvements, Mr. Holtzman must sell, move or get a league waiver to play in the stadium. Failing that, the league president can force a sale of the team -- though as a practical matter, that has not happened since the stadium standards were introduced in 1990.
Teams are rarely listed publicly for sale; rather, they sell via brokers or blind ads in sports journals. Owners don't want to anger fans by openly offering to sell a team that could move if sold. The governing body for the minors, the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues in St. Petersburg, Fla., stays out of the trading, but will help buyers find brokers.
Mr. Richmond, as a broker, advises that, "If you want to get the right management and work hard, and you would be satisfied with a 5 to 8 percent return on your investment, then O.K., we can do it."
Plenty buy anyway, including Mr. Veeck, who grew up around baseball. His grandfather, William Louis Veeck Sr., was president of the Chicago Cubs; his father, Bill Veeck, owned several teams, including the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago White Sox. (Perhaps following the example of his father, who was known for innovations, the younger Mr. Veeck ran a promotion in which an enormous Chia pet was doused with gasoline and set on fire.)
The young Mr. Veeck said it was a good year when a team made $200,000. Yet when he compares his least profitable team, the Butte Copper Kings in Montana, with his most profitable, "Butte lost money and I love them as dearly as St. Paul," he said.
IF money is to be made, it's in the long run. Joe J. Buzas, 79, of Salt Lake City, the owner of the Class AA New Britain Rock Cats in Connecticut and the Class AAA Salt Lake Buzz, says he has owned 83 teams in 52 years. "I've become a multimillionaire managing minor league baseball teams." he said.
Mr. Buzas was a minor-league player and had a brief stint in the majors -- "a cup of coffee," he calls it -- with the New York Yankees in 1945. "I didn't want to get off the stage, so I became an owner," he said.
Mr. Buzas said that any well-run AAA team should make $1 million a year, but that he has made his real money buying and selling. He bought the Class AA Reading Phillies in Pennsylvania in 1977 for $1. "I sold it nine years later for $1,000,001," he said.
Some owners, like Mr. Veeck, have a fanatical love of the game. "At the end of the day, no matter how rotten the day is, my office is a ball field," he says.
Others warn that it is easier to watch from the bleachers. "Being an owner makes it harder to enjoy a game," Mr. Holtzman said. "You are concerned if all of the light bulbs are working, if the hot dogs are warm, if the other fans are having a great time. It's a disadvantage."

How to Keep the Best Workers Working at Their Best

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
ALMOST every office has one: the recent M.B.A. with fire in her belly, the weekend-working overachiever who regularly finishes his daily list of things to do, the people who take on the workplace equivalent of ironing boxer shorts. Managers love them, unions distrust them and co-workers merely roll their eyes, knowing that on an island of perfectionists, the average Joe is doomed.
For a manager, such overworkers are priceless, and that is part of the problem. They cannot possibly be paid what they are worth, so how do companies keep them happy, keep them from slowing down and, most of all, keep them? 
 There are a variety of opinions on the care and feeding of overachievers, and every good manager has a solution. It is not a topic that lends itself easily to management-in-a-box answers, but this much is obvious: When merit pay is not affordable, or when work rules discourage action above and beyond the job description, the best managers have found other ways to motivate the best workers to do their best work.
Edward Lazear, a professor of economics and human resources at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, thinks the rewards must be broken down by the type of worker. He says managerial workers want promotions most of all, while wage earners generally produce best for the promise of more money. (Thus, piecework can be more attractive for them than hourly wages.) Younger workers are more likely to crave training and visibility; more established workers desire autonomy and freedom.
Professor Lazear advises bosses to set objective goals. "It's good to have managers try to commit to absolute standards, so everybody can be rewarded if they exceed a particular standard," he said. "But you've got to convince everyone that the standard is not going to move based on what happens this year -- because workers know if they goldbrick this year, the standards won't be higher next year."
Comparing workers with one another can damage morale, he said. "In school, you remember when the teacher would tell you that you could do something for extra credit? The question is: Is there really such a thing as extra credit? If everyone does extra credit and you're graded on a curve, and if you didn't do it and everyone else did, you're below average in the class."
Workplaces with overachievers can be tough for average people, but a good place to have stock options. Consider Microsoft, where working has been compared to drinking out of a firehose because there is just so much to do, said Julie Bick, 32, who retired as a millionaire after five years at the software giant in Redmond, Wash., and wrote the current best seller, "All I Really Need to Know in Business I Learned at Microsoft" (Pocket Books).
A company that hires so many whiz kids is wise to offer stock options, she said, recalling how her secretary at Microsoft, when asked to make copies of a marketing plan, came back instead with insightful suggestions on how to improve it, based on her reading of PC Week.
"It was just beautiful," Ms. Bick said. "The magic of stock options is if you have a star working for you, in most companies you'd want to keep him in your fiefdom. But with options, you'd say, 'This guy's smart, but he could be promoted to another group and do better there, and therefore my stock options will go up.' " Nobody is held back.
SOMETHING as simple as a cup of coffee can be a great incentive, too. When Charlotte Guyman, a general manager with MSNBC, the joint venture between Microsoft and NBC, took over a new group for Microsoft several years ago, she found herself managing 100 people in several departments, with pockets of rivalry, tight deadlines and many new hires. She knew she needed to keep communication flowing, create a strong team and get the best work out of everyone.
She decided to have monthly meetings, which in itself would not win her any management awards. But she added an incentive, based on her frequent midafternoon visits to the company espresso machine: the Char-Latte awards.
She chose winners based on nominations from her team, honoring those who had "produced great results, shown real fine teamwork or removed barriers to doing the right thing," said Ms. Guyman, who at 41, after 10 years at the company, just received a carrot of her own: a Microsoft Achievement Award, an eight-week sabbatical.
"People thought it was very fun," she said. "They'd get a gift certificate to go get a latte, attached to a bunch of helium balloons, in the meeting. It was very public, and people would send E-mail that said, 'Wow, that really felt good.'
"Sometimes people who get rewarded are the most vocal, but I found out about good stuff being done by people who were not high profile. It's pretty easy to lose touch for managers, especially when they have a lot of people below them. This was a good way for people to get recognized, even if they're not in personal contact with their manager."
The accent is on the personal, Ms. Bick said. "One year Microsoft gave out 500 identical plaques that said, 'For Your Individual Achievement.' People just thought it was ridiculous. They used them as doorstops," she said. "But if you get a congratulatory E-mail from Bill Gates, that's worth a lot."
Other employers have been able to direct employee performance with variable pay scales that reward specific extra efforts, said Marc John Wallace, a consultant at the Center for Workforce Effectiveness, a management consulting firm in Northbrook, Ill. This can work in union shops, too.
"A common pitfall is putting in a plan with unrealistic goals," he warned. "Then the incentive to work harder and overachieve is gone. The assumption is that there will be some kind of reward for extra effort, but if the goals aren't met, there's a feeling of helplessness, of not being able to achieve the goal, so why waste time trying?"
But for another breed of employees, a seemingly impossible goal can be the best incentive. "Giving people real big opportunities and problems, that's often highly motivating for someone who's a high achiever," Ms. Guyman said. "Some people like recognition or respect or money or power or control or promotion. Some may be motivated by time off or by a new challenge. Figuring that out is a pretty critical key."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
A Nobel Winner Wears Several Fund Hats

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
MYRON SCHOLES, the Stanford professor emeritus who recently won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for research into pricing options, is also a mutual fund investor. In fact, he sits on the boards of three fund complexes, helping them cut costs and improve operations. Along with his fellow Nobel winner, Robert C. Merton of the Harvard Business School, he is also a principal of Long Term Capital Management, a $6 billion hedge fund that invests principally in fixed-income securities and derivatives on them. He spoke last week from his office in Connecticut. TIMOTHY MIDDLETON
 
 Q. How did you get involved in the fund business? 
 A. I was involved with Wells Fargo Bank as a consultant in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when I suggested to them that they develop a product that has become known as index funds. That was how I initially got started thinking about investment products, doing research over the years that led me to understand, study and teach about mutual fund performance. So when Benham Group asked me to join their board of directors when they had a vacancy in 1981, I accepted the position.
Q. You invented index funds?
A. Yes, actually it was Fischer Black and me. That was in 1968. We called it passive investment, and it later became known as indexing. Of course, it was a long time before it really caught on as a viable product. I remember that in 1987, Vanguard funds only had about $500 million invested in index funds, and now it must be $60 billion to $70 billion.
Q. So you invented it but did not collect any of the huge funds that have subsequently flowed in?
A. Sometimes the early bird gets the worm, but sometimes the early bird gets frozen to death.
Q. Benham has since been acquired by American Century Funds. Do you remain on the board?
A. Yes, I'm on the board of all the Benham funds.
Q. And the other boards you sit on?
A. About 1983 or 1984, two former students of mine from the University of Chicago, Rex Sinquefield and David Booth, formed a mutual fund complex called Dimensional Fund Advisers, or DFA, to offer index-fund-like products. So I became a member of their board. Then around 1992 another former student, Doug Breeden, asked me to join the board of Smith Breeden & Company, which operates the Smith Breeden funds. Students ask you to be on their boards of directors sometimes. So I'm a director for three fund complexes.
Q. As a director, what interests you most about funds?
A. No. 1 is portfolio performance, No. 2 is transactions costs and No. 3 is customer service. In every case, I'm interested in seeing how these areas can be optimized.
Q. Can you give an example?
A. I got interested in customer service many years ago. As a director you get reports on customer service, and there's always a tendency to measure inputs, and not necessarily to measure outputs. What I mean is, you get a lot of statistics, like how many calls the fund company received and how long it takes to answer them, but you don't get at how the customer feels about the call. So trying to figure out ways to measure the output -- satisfaction -- is something I was interested in because as a board member I felt responsible for shareholders receiving the quality of service that was being paid for.
Q. Can you be more specific?
A. Well, that's proprietary and somewhat confidential. I can only say we try to figure out what the major factors are that the customer wants, then figure out the measures that will support that, as opposed to just starting out with a bunch of measures.
Q. You have mentioned indexing and a focus on cost control, and of course index funds are famous for being economical to operate. So does that mean you're not interested in actively managed mutual funds?
A. My career in academic research has not been involved with active management of securities. I've tried to understand risk-and-return relationships; also the pricing of derivative securities.
Q. Hence, the famous Black-Scholes model for pricing options?
A. Yes, I'm famous for a way to price an array of securities without having to know the expected returns of the underlying securities. That's what interests me.
Q. Do you invest in any of the funds you serve as a director?
A. I invest in some of the money market funds at Benham and also a small-cap index fund from DFA.
Q. Indexing isn't supposed to be as good as active management with small stocks, is it?
A. I think DFA has been very successful in providing index-like products in smaller stocks, not only for U.S. stocks, but they've also accomplished it for international indices as well. Active management doesn't just involve potential benefits; it also involves additional costs.
Q. What do you receive from the fund complexes for your services?
A. Directors' fees.
Q. Can you tell me what they are?
A. Well, approximately $80,000 to $100,000 a year.
Q. Do you have advice for investors?
A. My view is that one should diversify broadly across different fund investments. However, it's tough for investors to try to pick the appropriate risk level that they should manage their funds at. Having a personal adviser would be helpful.
Q. What are you going to do with your half-million-dollar prize money?
A. Actually, the standard answer to that is that part of it is going to go to the United States Government, in the form of taxes. And then people tell me it's expensive to take one's family to Sweden. So I haven't given a great deal of thought to it. However, as you know I manage money through my own firm here, so it's most likely I'll invest it here.
Q. Congratulations on winning the prize.
A. Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
For Reluctant Shoppers, A Turn Toward Tailors

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
IT'S an anything-goes fashion season, with retailers promoting everything from reptile prints and leather wrap dresses to pointy-breasted bustiers paired with pinstriped suits.
But Koren Harris, a recent law school graduate, is having none of it. Neither is Mary Ann Doran, a senior regulatory executive at Pfizer Inc. Rather than tuning into what clothing retailers are rolling out, Ms. Harris and Ms. Doran are tuning out. 
 Instead, they have joined a small but growing number of young professional women in turning to custom-designed clothes -- an option that used to be the domain of either clotheshorses or social heavyweights like Kitty Carlisle Hart.
For Ms. Doran, deliverance came last fall for $165, in the form of simple, custom-made black gabardine pants. At 5 feet 6 inches and 140 pounds, she had found clothes-shopping excruciating -- not only because she suffers from scoliosis, but also because she has long legs, big hips and a short torso.
"I'd rather take a licensing exam than shop," Ms. Doran said. "Depending on the clothes, I can be a size 8 or a size 14."
After looking at $300 pants that didn't fit her well, Ms. Doran asked Jennifer Butler, a designer in Fairfield, Conn., to make a pair, on the recommendation of a male co-worker who also had clothes made by her.
Encouraged by the pants' "outrageous" fit, as well as favorable comments from bystanders, Ms. Doran soon found herself wearing them everywhere.
"They're still in mint condition," she said. "Even with weight gain, these pants work like magic because they were so carefully designed to minimize my big hips."
Three weeks ago, Ms. Doran gave Ms. Butler an order for five more pairs.
Ms. Harris, who is 30, is just as keen on her foray into custom clothing. Making the rounds of popular retailers, she soon tired of looking at dull clothing in dull fabrics -- as well as at sales representatives who were, she said, "forcing a personality" on her.
Since then, she has had Ms. Butler put together more than 10 outfits. The price has been part of the appeal: Most of the outfits, she said, have cost 40 percent to 50 percent less than the $700 she once considered paying for a single Joan and David jacket.
In turning to custom-designed clothes, women say they are tired of buying clothing that fits badly, falls apart quickly and comes in styles that are either unwearably far out or depressingly dull. More often than not, customers like Ms. Doran also regard shopping with the loathing usually reserved for root canal surgery. Men, of course, have worn custom-made clothing for years, and some men's clothing companies do women's tailoring as well. (Brooks Brothers, for example, custom-designs women's shirts only.) But a growing number of women are turning to small, independent tailoring operations, where they usually get far more variety at often the same price.
Some tailors that have traditionally focused on men are now seeing more women as customers. Kamal Ramchandani, the owner of La Rukico/Hong Kong Custom Tailors in Manhattan, says 15 percent of his customers are now women. He says his business sells only Hong Kong-made business suits for women, which are made either from about 20 basic styles or from pictures supplied by customers.
Mark Montano, a designer in Manhattan's East Village, says he has noticed another trend that may explain why people love custom clothes. "People are tired of looking alike," he said.
According to Mr. Montano and other designers, the custom business has grown 30 percent in the New York region in the last year. Other people in the industry cited the strong New York economy and booming stock market as reasons for custom clothiers' increasing trade.
One of Mr. Montano's most popular items is a basic shift, which he can sew in a silk-and-wool blend for $180. Still, most custom-made clothing isn't quite that affordable. "It's a common misconception," sighed Jennifer Robbins, a Manhattan dressmaker who works out of her apartment. "You do this to get a terrific fit, or a beautiful fabric, but not necessarily to save money."
Finding a quality dressmaker can be as taxing as threading a needle. Indeed, because of the patience and time needed for custom work, many well-known tailoring operations, like Rosette Couturiere, on West 71th Street, no longer do it.
"There certainly aren't many of us out there," said Marjorie Jonas, a Manhattan dressmaker. Ms. Jonas, who charges $450 to $500 for a business suit (excluding fabric) is so busy that she has not taken on new clients for more than a month.
"This is a bit of an underground operation," said Anna Lou Plott, a pattern-maker for Anna Sui, the designer, who also teaches at the Parsons School of Design. "Most people who do this don't have a lot of money to advertise."
Fabric stores often know of reputable dressmakers. Generally, though, the custom business operates by word of mouth. And even then, some women jealously guard the names of their dressmakers, for fear that they'll be whisked away.
"It's like stealing your best friend's maid in the Hamptons," said one well-dressed Wall Street securities analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You can't commit a more serious offense."
Larry Shapiro, the owner of Banksville Designer Fabrics in Norwalk, Conn., says few dressmakers now like to take on complicated projects like suit-making. "They'd rather take on four or five skirts, which only take an hour and a half or so each," he said.
As a result, he added, consumers who want a properly made woman's suit and jacket should plan to spend $650 to $700.
"If you have a tailor in Poland, Vietnam, or China, you can have a suit for $30, but a properly made suit in the U.S. costs a minimum of $450," he said. "Fabric isn't the expensive part; making a suit correctly takes at least 30 hours of work, and most seamstresses want to work for at least $15 an hour."
Dressmakers work under other constraints as well. For example, Deborah Anderko, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, does not do men's wear or hand-stitching, or even bound buttonholes; she does only those that are stitched. On the other hand, Ms. Anderko can make a simple, pocketless suit at a price starting at $375.
"There are many different levels to this business," Ms. Butler added. "Potential customers need to know their designers' limitations; for example, whether they work with only certain styles."
IT also helps to know what to look for when assessing a dressmaker's skills.
"Fabric should hang from the shoulder -- men know this, but women don't," said Carol Molesworth, a former men's wear product manager who is now features editor at Manhattan User's Guide, a monthly newsletter. "If a tailor spends a lot of time laying her hands on your shoulders, she's probably doing the job right."
Ms. Robbins recommends that consumers who want the best fit ask their tailor for a muslin fitting, which uses pieces of inexpensive muslin stitched together to approximate the actual garment.
While some dressmakers charge extra for the fitting -- usually $60 to $150 -- Ms. Robbins includes it in the price of her garments. Because she is such a stickler for fit, she often does two muslin fittings for pants, which generally run $200.
In assessing a dressmaker's work, industry experts recommend honing in on smaller details, too. For example, Ms. Molesworth recommends that consumers check for puckering on pockets and collars ("It only gets worse with subsequent cleanings"); broken, uneven stitching; flimsy buttonholes where the fabric pokes through; unaligned pockets ("More common than we think") and loose, loopy stitching at the bottom of pockets.
There is still no industry standard for assessing dressmakers' skills. But the Professional Association of Custom Clothiers, which has about 700 members, is developing one. Meanwhile, consumers can call the association (541 772-4119) to get referrals for reputable dressmakers in their areas.
Susan Khalje, the association's national chairwoman, said members must provide references of their work as dressmakers. She suggested that consumers also check with her organization's local chapters, which sometimes have oversight services that check the quality of members' work.
Because of the time needed to find high-quality, custom-designed clothes, some consumers may decide to opt out. Fittings, for example, can be a problem: A business suit may require three or four of them. And sometimes the custom-design experience can be unnerving in other ways.
"Clothing in stores is designed to look good hanging on the racks, so you have to remember that you're getting a body double when you have something made," Ms. Molesworth said. "For some people, that can be a bit of a shock."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Will Asia's Malady Infect the World?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Risk, the four-letter word investors forgot, is back. And so is the business cycle.
It was stock market gyrations that captured all the headlines last week, as Hong Kong led the world on a wild ride. But the most interesting developments might have been taking place in international bond markets. There, the complacency that had greeted Asia's problems has evaporated. 
 "It was the first time we saw contagion in our market," said Lincoln Y. Rathnam, the president of Schooner Asset Management in Boston, speaking of the market for third world debt.
When Asia's troubles started, the initial response of many investors was to seek safety in, of all places, Latin America. It was taken for granted that emerging markets would continue to grow. And if one set of them had problems, why not head for the others? South American Brady bonds -- government bonds widely owned by foreigners whose principal, but not interest payments, are effectively guaranteed by the United States Treasury -- saw their prices rise. So did Latin American stock markets.
At the end of June, governments that had Brady bonds outstanding had an effective interest cost of about four percentage points more than the comparable Treasury rates. Then Asian currencies began to suffer, and money left that region for Latin America. By early last week the spread between rates was down to 3.3 percentage points, a huge move. But all of that move evaporated on Thursday and Friday.
What appears to have happened is that a lot of bond managers, including some whose clients thought they were more conservative, had bought Latin bonds. Now, they are scrambling to get out, as are stock fund managers who bought Latin equities. They fear that the Asian malady may spread.
Asia, an area of rapid growth for much of the 1990's, probably is in for a significant slump. Details vary from country to country, of course, but the region is characterized by excessive debt for many companies and gross overbuilding of office buildings and of some industries. Real estate prices in many countries had risen far too rapidly. Many banks are in trouble.
That slump means that Asians are less likely to buy what we sell, and more likely to cut prices to push the goods they sell to us. That means lower inflation for us, and bigger risks for investors in Asia.
If investors do turn more averse to emerging markets, it will be harder for even those countries with good economic conditions to attract capital, a situation that will limit their growth and possibly lead to failures among companies that might have made it had the capital spigot remained open.
Such a flight to safety could have positive implications for American markets. Less money going into third world bonds may make more money available for American ones. But believers in the rosy economic outlook, in which recession-free growth continues for years and years, may pause at the realization that the business cycle lives on in the part of the world that had been the strongest. World growth is unlikely to be as high as was expected, and neither are corporate profits in America, Europe or Japan.
Even as American stocks were sliding late last week, the American junk bond market was holding up. So far, investors do not foresee real economic problems in this country. But the complacent feeling that all is right with the world has been shaken. Greed may still be the prevalent emotion, but fear is gaining.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH: MEL BROOKS;
A Funny Man Earns It The 2,000-Year-Old Way

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
HERE is Mel Brooks, the director of the sidesplitting classics "Blazing Saddles" and "Young Frankenstein," as he dons the persona of the 2,000-Year-Old Man to talk money with Carl Reiner, his 40-year sidekick.
 
MR. REINER Do you have money in the market?
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN All my money is in tax-free bonds in the state of California, where I happen to be living. Whatever California does, I'm with them. They want to build a race track -- I'm there. They want to build a hydroelectric plant -- I'm with them. And the bonds pay over 2 percent. I'm keeping even with the erosion of my money.
 
MR. REINER What do you think about people like Bill Gates, who has $90 billion? Actually, more like $40 billion in Microsoft stock.
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN Well, I say good luck to him. He's an enterprising young fellow. And a bit of a stingy bastard. I heard Ted Turner -- not even Jewish -- gave $1 billion to the United Nations. I don't think Gates gave 11 cents to anything.
 
MR. REINER Well, we don't know.
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN I think in the Torah it says thou shalt give 10 percent of your goods. So Jews take it very seriously and they give 6 percent of their goods. That's as close as you want to come to 10 percent. This guy, if he gave 6 percent of his wealth, we'd all be rolling in dough.
 
MR. REINER If you had $90 billion, what would you do?
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN I think you have to invest in blue chips.
 
MR. REINER In stocks?
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN No, no, don't be ridiculous; stay away from stocks. Invest in the blue chips themselves. They are used all over. You go to any neighborhood, you'll see 100 people playing poker.
 
MR. REINER What about microchips?
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN That's why that guy -- Bill Gates -- got $90 billion.
 
MR. REINER He's a modern-day Midas. Did you know Midas?
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN I knew Midas. We didn't go out together because you knew you had to pick up the tab. You go to dinner with Midas and before the end of the dinner, he picks up his glass to you and your wife and says: "To my host and hostess," and that's his way of getting out of the check.
The 2,000-Year-Old Man may laugh at money, but Mel Brooks knows that it is no laughing matter. Many years ago, he confided to friends that he was afraid of dying young and poor. Today, at 71, he is no longer young. Though he guards his net worth closely, he is certainly not poor. He has invested much of his savings in real estate, which alone has an estimated market value of close to $20 million. And if he cannot control his aging, he can at least control his assets, by following a conservative investment strategy.
Though Mr. Brooks also invests in his own film production company, when it comes to savings, "basically 80 percent of what I own is in property," Mr. Brooks said in his trademark gravelly voice during an interview at the New York offices of HarperCollins, publisher of "The 2,000-Year-Old Man in the Year 2000," his new book and CD.
That strategy makes for an abundance of abodes. He has two homes in Los Angeles, one an ultra-chic sprawl on one of the fanciest streets in Los Angeles, which Linda May, a real estate broker at Coldwell Banker there, estimates is worth $5 million. The other is a beach cottage in Malibu, which she believes has a value of $4 million. He also owns two homes -- one of which was designed by the architect Richard Meier -- on Fire Island, off Long Island, as well as an apartment in Manhattan and an office building on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, Calif., with an estimated value of $6 million.
In addition, there are two beachfront condominiums on Fisher Island, the resort off Miami Beach. A resident there believes the properties are worth $400,000 each.
"Real estate is a conservative and wise investment as long as you use it," Mr. Brooks said. "Especially a house at the beach. You can put your feet on the sand. You can put your toe in the water. And you can always rent it," he said with a mischievous smile.
Like his ancient alter ego, Mr. Brooks says he has also invested in California bonds. Yet, so deep is his distrust of stocks that he has kept pretty much on the sidelines of the greatest bull market in Wall Street history. Living in Los Angeles is one reason, he jokes: "We are three hours behind. If you get up at 6 in the morning, you don't get the chemistry. The entire West Coast is three hours out of the stock market. I believe in bonds because I don't care what they do. It's a contract. At the end of three years, I get the money."
Does he have any regrets about missing out on the market's ascent? Not on your life. "You always have your house," he said. "It is hard to live in pork bellies -- just the odor alone would chase you out." So what if pork bellies are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade? "The stock market is rumors," he added. "A lot of people have gotten rich. Swell. Ten years ago, a lot of people suddenly got poor."
The son of a process server who worked for New York City, Mr. Brooks grew up poor -- but didn't realize it because he was having too much fun. "You're warm, you don't realize you're not having meat more than once a week," he said. "You play in the street. You put a couple of brown bags together and tie them up and that's your football."
Perhaps his aversion to stocks stems from an ingrained need for security spawned by his frighteningly volatile career.
In his late 20's, he was a sought-after entertainer in the Borscht Belt, the summer resort hotels in the Catskills north of New York City, and shared writing credits with Carl Reiner on Sid Caesar's and Imogene Coca's popular television series, "Your Show of Shows."
BUT success went to his head. He recalled many years ago in an interview with Playboy: "There I was, strolling around in silk shirts and thinking: 'I'm cut out for greatness. Television's too small for me. How am I going to get out of this lousy racket?' "
In 1957, he found out. "Suddenly I am out of it," he said. "The show's off the air, and I couldn't get a job." His weekly income dipped as low as $85 a week -- quite a comedown from the $5,000 a week of "Your Show of Shows." "I did odd jobs," he said. "I got $320 to appear on the 'Tonight' show."
He was saved by the 1960 release of the first 2,000-Year-Old-Man recording, an overnight sensation. But it didn't make him rich, and when he began seeing the actress Anne Bancroft, whom he would marry in 1964, he continued watching his pennies. "She was my patroness," he recalled. "We were living separately, and then I moved in with her. I always saved enough money to pay for dinner. I was not quite a gigolo. I always paid for the food, even though I didn't pay for the rent.
"But she was paying for a lot of other stuff that I don't bring up," he added slyly. "Like laundry and dry cleaning."
Even when Mr. Brooks took his act to Hollywood in the early 1960's, directing films that became cult classics, he wasn't laughing all the way to the bank. "So here I made two movies that would be loved by people in Greenwich Village. I never saw a penny profit from either of them. I just made my fee. From 'The Producers' I made $35,000 and from '12 Chairs' I made $50,000."
Mr. Brooks also made some money -- and fame -- with Buck Henry when the two created the pilot for "Get Smart," a TV series about the daffy escapades of the secret agent Maxwell Smart. Still, Mr. Brooks had long periods of unemployment.
"My two movies had gone nowhere as far as money was concerned," he said. "I was out of work for a long time. I was walking down the street looking down. I ran into David Begelman" -- the studio executive who at that time was a talent agent. "He asked me why I was looking in the gutter. I told him I was looking for change."
IT was Mr. Begelman, a friend, who put Mr. Brooks into "Blazing Saddles," a Wild West farce produced in 1974 that, among other things featured a black sheriff played by Cleavon Little, and a Jewish Indian played by Mr. Brooks.
"He said he had a rough draft of a screenplay by Andrew Bergman called 'Tex X,' and Warner wanted to make it but they needed the right script," Mr. Brooks recalled. "I started working on it with a group of writers that included Richard Pryor."
The movie was a blockbuster and sealed Mr. Brooks's reputation as a comic genius. It also ended his money woes.
"We made this crazy movie," he said. "And it was my first megahit. I had 12 or 15 percent of the net profits" after the studio had recovered its investment, a typical arrangement at the time. "They couldn't hide the money. It spilled over."
So what did he do with his new-found riches? He bought a house, of course, in the Hollywood Hills. Or rather, two houses, one for his family (which by now included his wife, Anne, and their young son, Max) and one "across the way" to rent out. It seemed like such a safe, predictable way to invest. "Then, you could put $10 down and pay it off for the rest of your life," he said.
That was the beginning of his foray into real estate, a form of investment that seems to fire his imagination. Alan Ladd Jr., a movie executive for whom Mr. Brooks worked in the 1970's, recalls his gusto for the business: "Once, when he was in my office, he was staring out the window, and said to me, 'See -- I own that building!' "
But even as his bank account bulged, Mr. Brooks chafed under the suspicion that Hollywood's accountants weren't treating him right. His upfront fees from "Blazing Saddles," produced by Warner Brothers, and "Young Frankenstein" produced by 20th Century Fox, totaled a few hundred thousand dollars -- a respectable sum at that time. But he believes their runaway success entitled him to a fat bonus.
He said studios are creative in calculating their costs in ways that hold net profits down. "With net profits, you'll never see a thing," he said. "They have this thing called rolling break-even, and the accountants are told to keep rolling it so it never breaks even, because that's when they pay profit participants."
In truth his share of net profit over 23 years probably came to $5 million for each film, but Mr. Brooks maintains that he should at least have received a bigger upfront payment.
"When I saw how much money 'Blazing Saddles' and 'Young Frankenstein' made -- let's say they made $150 million between them," he said, his voice trailing off. "It was my child. Don't you think they would give me $5 million? Nope. I didn't make $1 million.
"The artists risk their reputation," he said. "The studios risk their money. When they have a big surprise, like 'Young Frankenstein,' you would think there would be a thank you."
By 1980, when he was working as producer and director of another movie project, "History of the World, Part I," he concluded that he could no longer trust a studio to handle his business.
So he approached Alan J. Hirschfield, then president of 20th Century Fox. Instead of working for a fee and a percentage of worldwide profits, he told him: "You are going to give me $10 million to make 'History of the World.' I am not going to take any fees. But you are going to give me all the foreign rights."
The foreign market was growing then, Mr. Brooks recalled, glowing with pleasure as he described his epiphany as an entrepreneur. "And the studio has already recovered its costs, so you are assured more profits," he said.
"Hirschfield said, 'This is impossible.' And then I got a brilliant scheme. I said I was going to call The Wall Street Journal and tell them I was selling all my stock in 20th Century Fox because I had no faith in the current management."
Did Mr. Brooks own any 20th Century Fox stock? "I didn't have one share," he boasted. Nevertheless, he said, Mr. Hirschfield blinked, agreeing to make the $10 million payment and to relinquish foreign rights.
As a result, Mr. Brooks made more money from "History" than on any other film. Emile Buyse, who handled foreign distribution, said it grossed $35 million abroad, leaving Mr. Brooks's company with a profit of about $7 million.
"Remember he kept all the video and TV rights overseas, too," Mr. Buyse said. Since then, Mr. Brooks has always sought to retain as much control over his films as possible and is considered one of the industry's smarter businessmen.
Mr. Hirschfield said he didn't recall the details of the deal, but acknowledged that Mr. Brooks was a formidable bargainer. "He is a good, hard-edged businessman," he said. "I have a feeling that Mel has every dollar he ever made."
As long as Mr. Brooks is talking about deal-making, he figures he might as well mention his lawyer, Alan U. Schwartz. He has worked with Mr. Schwartz for years, he says, but "I still do not know what the U. stands for."
"I think it is window dressing," he added, "but if it is Urkel, I will drop him like a hot potato."
Mr. Schwartz declined to say what the "U" stood for.
For all his success, a 1987 effort to make a film called "Solar Babies" with private financing reminded Mr. Brooks of how precarious the business is. Before he finished raising the money, he dipped into his own account to start shooting in Spain before the rainy season.
"Then, when I was into it for something like $5 million or $6 million, the financing collapsed," he recalled with horror. Had he stopped shooting right away, he couldn't even exploit the loss as a tax deduction because, he said, "I had no income."
He quickly negotiated a bank loan, but the stress was too much. "It was scary," he said. "I couldn't sleep. I actually had a kind of nervous breakdown." In desperation, he looked again for outside backing, heaving a sigh of relief when he finally sold the film to MGM/UA, paid off the banks and recouped his investment. And he has sworn off entrepreneurship forever.
To be sure, Mr. Brooks has dipped his toe into Wall Street's raging waters, but he says he will never go in higher than his ankles out of fear of being swept away. About two years ago, "I bought stocks, not futures," he said, making clear his aversion to the sort of fancy financial instruments that can make some people rich but that he views as a shortcut to the poorhouse.
AND the stocks he bought? Gold-mining stocks, the ones that deal in the oldest store of value in human history, older even than houses -- and that pay solid dividends, too.
"I feel that when and if the bull market turns into something else and everyone panics, the stock will go up," Mr. Brooks said. "One stock pays a 7.5 percent dividend. So I'm not selling."
If all else fails, Mr. Brooks figures he can get people to pay him to make them laugh. "I can sing. I can dance. I can tell jokes," he said. "I can write screenplays. I can act. I can produce movies. For me, the thrill of seeing a stock go up is no big thrill."
His alter ego couldn't agree more.
 
MR. REINER How do you feel about this stock market going up and then falling? It's been very volatile lately.
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN It's good for the medical profession. There is heart trouble. There are emergency wards all over New York. Every time the market drops 6 or 7 points, you find guys: "Ah, my heart! Get me out of Coca-Cola!" Or: "Get me a Coca-Cola."
 
MR. REINER In 1929, how did you handle seeing people jumping out of windows?
 
2,000-YEAR-OLD MAN I jumped, too. But I jumped from the second floor, and I made sure there was an awning. They were jumping; I joined them.

HEADLINE: The Brave New World of General Motors

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
SPIN the steering wheel of a Chevrolet Lumina and the car is slow to turn. Press hard on the gas, and there's a long pause before it accelerates. And, somehow, the Lumina manages to look large on the outside and feel small on the inside.
None of this stops executives at the General Motors Corporation from feeling completely satisfied. The Lumina is making money, good money, thank you, in the treacherously competitive midsize car market. Because of its relatively low price and carefully focused marketing, the car is a favorite among price-conscious families and retirees. 
 "People love it," said John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive. "It's a beautiful car, it's highly regarded, it's got great customer satisfaction, it's got excellent quality."
What it doesn't have is a lot of fans in motordom. "It's kind of a rent-a-car," sniffed David E. Davis Jr., editor of Automobile magazine. "A car dealer once told me that the problem with General Motors is that nowhere in the United States is there a 14-year-old boy with tears in his eyes saying, 'Please, Dad, buy a Lumina.' "
That's O.K. with Mr. Smith. Let Chrysler dazzle buyers with racy new styling. Let Ford push out some of the hottest new trucks. Profits are Mr. Smith's mantra, not pizazz. Because in the last analysis, his plan for completing the resuscitation of the world's biggest company is to make money steadily at home while leading G.M. into the biggest overseas expansion in its history.
Since taking over in 1992, when the company lost money on nearly every sale of a car or truck, Mr. Smith has brought G.M. back from the brink. He has pared its work force and closed or sold 29 unneeded factories while shaking up a complacent culture and highly bureaucratic structure. In just five years, he has engineered one of the biggest financial turnarounds in American corporate history. Waves of red ink have been replaced by near-record profits. The company's share of the United States market has stopped shrinking and begun growing. And Wall Street has bid the stock up, about 31 percent since July alone, past levels not seen in three decades. It hit an all-time high on Wednesday of $72.4375; it closed on Friday at $68.0625.
Mr. Smith plans to take a quintessentially American enterprise and turn it into a company that by 2006 plans to sell more than half its cars and trucks outside the United States, up from just 43 percent last year.
And while that strategy may seem unduly risky in a world of undulating currencies, madcap financial markets and unsettled emergent economies, the impetus is clear: G.M.'s traditional bases -- the United States and Europe -- are slow-growth markets where profits go to companies that cut costs best. So G.M. figures it has no choice but to aim at foreign markets with a potential for double-digit growth.
In G.M.'s upper echelons, the talk is not so much about the future at home as about the future in Brazil, Poland and China. Just last week, the company expanded its plans to build Buicks in Shanghai. It has just produced a "global Cadillac," to be sold in more than 40 countries, and its Opel division in Europe is busy sending designs to new factories on three continents.
But is G.M. up to the job? Just how deep has its turnaround been? Has it cut costs enough, breathed enough life into its suffocating culture and put the right people in place, both at home and abroad? And if the Lumina stands for the proposition that the biggest doesn't have to be the best, will that corporate realpolitik continue to sell at home, let alone around the world?
After all, G.M. isn't the only big car company to realize that the action is now in points east and south. Industry analysts complain that there are already too many factories around the world pumping out ever more cars and trucks. And what happens to G.M. when the American economy hits a wall, as it eventually must, and a recession sweeps buyers from the nation's auto showrooms?
There are some who say Mr. Smith's success has come only as a result of the strong economic expansion at home. "He has lucked into the best market in history and done not very well," said Gerald C. Meyers, the former chairman of American Motors who is now a professor at Carnegie Mellon's Graduate School of Industrial Administration. "G.M. profits are being driven by a consistently powerful market, not a consistently powerful management," added Mr. Meyers, who says he believes that neither G.M.'s cars nor its market share have improved enough to signal long-term success.
Yet most outside experts are more optimistic, albeit cautiously so, recognizing that G.M.'s recovery remains a work in progress.
"Give them to the year 2000 or 2001, and you won't be able to count the profits," said James E. Harbour, a manufacturing efficiency expert at Harbour & Associates in Troy, Mich., who was among the first to predict the current resurgence of Chrysler. Mr. Harbour, once one of G.M.'s fiercest critics, now lauds the company for its gains in productivity and quality.
TO be sure, the experts acknowledge that G.M. was such a basket case that even the most minimal improvements were bound to bring huge gains.
"Measured against the old G.M. standard, they're doing very well," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz L.L.C., a New York investment banking and brokerage firm. "Measured against where they need to be and have to be, they're still not there, and it has been five years."
The company still lags behind its peers in many important efficiency measures. Nor has it reached Mr. Smith's goal of an average 5 percent profit margin, in good times and bad, and a 12.5 percent return on net assets, a financial benchmark G.M. uses to measure how effectively the corporation uses its assets. For the first nine months of the year, G.M.'s net profit margin was 4.3 percent, and the return on net assets was running at about 10 percent.
There is also no question that some big bumps lie ahead. Its global expansion drive is already causing strains -- the chairman of the company's Adam Opel unit in Germany, David J. Herman, may soon be forced out. The division has been struggling to compete in Europe while it also shoulders responsibility for the small cars G.M. sells in emerging markets. G.M. has a troubled relationship with the United Automobile Workers union, which has shown little reluctance to shut down the company during disputes. And rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Toyota have moved into its core area of profits -- the sale of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks.
Still, Mr. Smith can take pride in managing a huge swing to profitability. The year before he took over, G.M. was losing an average of $969 on each car and truck sold. Now, it is earning an average of $769 (an estimated $700 for each Lumina) and is on track to beat last year's total profit of $4.96 billion. Yet G.M. is still behind Toyota, which earned more than $1,150 per vehicle in the first nine months of 1997, as well as behind Chrysler, which had average profits of $1,306 a vehicle in that period.
Although G.M. still hasn't fixed all its problems, David E. Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan, said the company was starting to frighten its competitors for the first time in decades.
"In the next couple of years, unless some disaster happens, you're going to see a really very strong company," Mr. Cole said. "The road map is there, and it is just a matter of getting down the road."
Mr. Smith acknowledges that not all the numbers are where he would like them, but adds that "we're nowhere near finished" with cost-cutting and other improvements.
What is crucial, he and other G.M. executives say, is playing to the company's strong suits: "We need to take advantage of our size, which is our greatest strength," Mr. Smith says.
Now, G.M. is belatedly trying to act like a manufacturing company run by accountants, like an international giant run by global executives and like a consumer products company run by marketers.
In practical terms, that means using common components and processes worldwide. Indeed, the company is simultaneously building nearly identical factories in four countries: Argentina, China, Poland and Thailand.
It also means mining the giant company for talent. Mr. Smith, who is 59, has salted his top ranks with younger executives with deep financial and foreign experience. These include Louis R. Hughes, 48, who heads G.M.'s international operations; G. Richard Wagoner Jr., 44, president of North American operations; John F. Smith, also 46, no relation to the chairman, who heads the Cadillac division, and Mark T. Hogan, 46, general manager of the North American small-car group.
One of the linchpins of G.M.'s turnaround, outsiders say, is value pricing -- selling cars, like the Lumina, that are more attractively priced than others in their class. The company can still make money on those cars if it succeeds in harnessing its enormous size to produce cost efficiencies. And the cars will continue to sell well, industry experts say, as long as their value offsets their inability to quicken a driver's pulse. The '98 Lumina sells for $17,795; its competition includes the Ford Taurus, which starts at $18,795.
When Mr. Smith took the chief executive's reins, replacing Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s future looked bleak. From 1990 through 1992, the company lost a whopping $29.94 billion. Things were so bad that there was talk in the industry that G.M. might file for bankruptcy protection.
MR. SMITH is hardly the swashbuckling chief executive you might expect it would take to turn around the giant auto maker. He looks a bit like Eddie Munster, the 1960's sitcom character, because of his strong widow's peak. Whenever possible, he steers clear of the limelight, and when he must give a speech, it is usually wooden yet sincere, delivered with his boyhood Massachusetts accent.
Mr. Smith started hacking away at the huge waste that for so long plagued the company, making mostly unglamorous changes that customers don't notice. It was a task for which he was well-suited. After starting as a bean counter at a a G.M. factory in Framingham, Mass., he worked in G.M.'s powerful treasurer's office in New York before helping to turn around the company's troubled European operations in the 1980's.
He faced layers of inefficiencies. Buying auto parts, raw materials and other supplies account for roughly half the company's costs, but it wasn't long ago that G.M. had 27 independent purchasing centers just for North America. Mr. Smith consolidated global purchasing efforts into one office, enabling G.M. to push for better deals as it bought big quantities of everything from steel to car radios -- a legacy of its troubled relationship with its former purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. The efforts saved $8 billion over five years.
The cost-cutting went far beyond purchasing, of course. The company previously used 22 vehicle underbody designs worldwide, each costing more than $500 million to engineer and some differing only by millimeters. Now it uses 14 chassis and within the next decade plans to use just 9.
G.M. engineers are also following the lead of Toyota and other efficiency experts and designing cars with fewer parts, so that assembling them requires fewer workers. The 1997 Chevrolet Malibu, for instance, was designed to be built by 22 percent fewer workers than were needed for the car it replaced. A couple of years ago, G.M. installed 240 different steering columns in its cars and trucks; soon, it will use just a dozen companywide, Mr. Harbour said. Customers are unlikely to notice the difference.
FURTHER cost-cutting is crucial because G.M. expects it won't be able to increase prices in any meaningful way in the United States the next five years, given the slow growth and intense competition here.
Ask Mr. Smith about the North American market, in fact, and he looks weary; but ask him about fast-growing areas like Eastern Europe and China, and his eyes light up. He waxes on, with a tone of wonder, about Shanghai, noting that 2,000 skyscrapers are being built in the city.
G.M. can't expand abroad fast enough, it seems. In the last five years, it has opened or announced plans to build 10 assembly plants (including one in Shanghai) and 94 components factories outside the United States. G.M. is negotiating to build an additional assembly factory in China, people on Wall Street said. Mr. Smith's goal is to have 10 percent of the Asia-Pacific market by 2005, up from 4.5 percent now. Worldwide, G.M.'s market share is 17 percent.
The company's auto parts division, Delphi Automotive Systems, has been the first to enter some of G.M.'s new markets abroad, to do business not only with its parent company but also with other auto makers. In the last five years, Delphi has signed agreements to open 94 auto parts factories abroad.
Having worked overseas, far from Detroit's stultifying culture, Mr. Smith and other top executives were able to employ modern management techniques. They have imported some of the lessons, however obvious, to Detroit.
Industry experts give high marks to Mr. Smith's remaking of G.M.'s culture. "It really was putting common-sense business principles to work," said David Bradley, an auto analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities Inc.
Mr. Smith championed teamwork, benchmarking, innovation and continuous improvement -- not the back-stabbing competition between divisions and the resistance to change that used to be G.M.'s hallmarks. Early on, Mr. Smith shuttered the executive dining room. Executives are now encouraged not to hide bad news. And a headquarters bureaucracy that once numbered 13,000 was trimmed to less than 1,000, greatly speeding decisions throughout the company.
In the old days, even acknowledging that G.M. had problems could nearly end an executive's career. In the late 1980's, the younger Mr. Smith, now the Cadillac division head, told a roomful of G.M. executives that the Lexus luxury sedans being introduced by Toyota were poised to eat Cadillac's lunch.
"The temperature dropped 25 degrees," Mr. Smith recalled. His proposal that Cadillac develop its own smaller luxury sedan was rejected without protest. Mr. Smith was soon banished to what was then considered Siberia -- G.M.'s European operations. Cadillac sales plummeted.
"Back then, they just shot and buried you," Cadillac's Mr. Smith said. Now, "if somebody says the sky is falling, you're going to get a fair hearing."
THE trouble, of course, is that Cadillac missed a chance to attract an entire generation of affluent baby boomers to its showrooms, buyers who now view Lexus as a status symbol and see Cadillac as a car only for their parents. Even with new management, G.M. has made plenty of mistakes, including the following:
* While Chrysler has just completed its first car designed entirely on computer, saving eight months and about $80 million in the process, G.M. only recently settled on one computer system to use for its paperless cars and is years away from having any on the streets.
* In Europe, G.M. watched Mr. Lopez defect to Volkswagen and drastically cut that company's costs, just as he had done for G.M. in Detroit. Volkswagen predictably lowered its European prices, and while G.M. belatedly scrambles to cut its European costs, it is watching once-steady profits tumble to losses in Europe.
* General Motors still sells some truly awful cars; the Buick Skylark and Oldsmobile Achieva are so bereft of curb appeal that G.M. will not send the 1998 models to dealerships, only to rental car fleets.
* After building a popular new small-car division, Saturn, G.M. has watched its sales languish recently because there is no Saturn sport utility vehicle to keep buyers from defecting to Toyota's RAV4 or Honda's CR-V.
* Although G.M. has introduced 15 new models in the last 18 months that are light-years ahead of those they replace, auto reviewers and Wall Street analysts concur that few, if any, are truly better than the competition, which is already developing its next onslaught.
"They are still playing catch-up, and they will play catch-up for a long time," Ms. Keller of Furman Selz said.
Still, perhaps the best example of the new, faster-moving General Motors came last year, when the company was weighing plans to spend several hundred million dollars for a new headquarters.
In early March 1996, Matthew P. Cullen, a G.M. real estate planner, learned that Detroit's landmark Renaissance Center, a complex of five shiny glass cylinders, was for sale.
G.M. changed course, and in just a month's time, the $75 million deal was done. In the old G.M., "I would have gone to somebody who went to somebody and then it would've been reviewed by 15 committees," Mr. Cullen said.
And the company has elevated the role of its long-neglected marketing efforts. In late 1994, G.M., which seldom scouts for executive talent from outside its ranks, brought in Ronald L. Zarrella, who had been president of Bausch & Lomb, to revamp the company's rudderless marketing.
Mr. Zarrella has sought to counteract a perennial problem at G.M.: internal competition that allowed, for instance, some of its Chevrolets to compete most fiercely against Pontiacs, not Fords and Toyotas. Mr. Zarella has aimed each of G.M.'s car and truck models at specific slivers of the market. The company markets Luminas, for instance, to buyers looking not for precision handling but for a set of relatively cheap, reliable wheels.
Mr. Zarrella himself has further shaken things up by hiring a slew of "brand managers" to plan the new strategies -- marketing experts who used to hawk cookies, soft drinks and granola snacks now play a big role in guiding the $1.6 billion the nation's largest advertiser spends annually.
BUYERS have warmed up to G.M.'s cars and trucks, particularly of late. The company's domestic market share, which fell from a high of 51 percent in 1962 to a low of 28 percent this spring, climbed to 31.7 percent by the end of the third quarter.
"They've made some vast improvements, but still, by industry standards, they've got a long way to go," said Robert B. Duncan, a professor of leadership and organizational change at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. After all, he added, "It was an organization that everyone was calling a dinosaur seven or eight years ago."
Mr. Smith acknowledges as much. "We think we're 60 to 70 percent of the way there," he said recently in an interview in his office, where he keeps several large fossils from Brazil on display.
The trick is to keep the sense of urgency going, Mr. Smith said. After noting that the fossils were millions of years old, he said of G.M., "We have to run fast to make sure we're not a dinosaur."

Graphs: "Better, but Not the Best"
General Motors has steadily improved the quality of its cars and trucks, and their profitability, too. But for the 1997 model year, G.M. still lagged behind the industry's quality average of 86 problems for each 100 vehicles, according to J.D. Power & Associates. And while G.M. beat Ford's profit per vehicle of $660, it remained well behind Honda ($1,050), Toyota ($1,150) and Chrysler ($1,306). Graphs show quality and profit figures since 1991.

In the old G.M., executives running big operations were 30-year men. Today, four men in their 40's hold lofty positions and are expected to advance further. All have overseas experience, strong financial backgrounds and Harvard M.B.A.'s and all have worked directly along the way with John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Word for Word / Drinking Etiquette Abroad;
How to Succeed in Business By Getting Really Bombed

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
WITH apologies to the life-style police, there's a downside to the decline of the American three-martini lunch. For it seems that the nation's global economic competitiveness depends in part on the ability of its representatives to knock 'em back with some serious boozers abroad.
At least that's one impression, among many, to be gained from a series of handbooks on business etiquette and ethics in various countries published by NTC Business Books of Lincolnwood, Ill. 
 Here are excerpts from four volumes, three dealing with Asian tigers and the fourth with another huge market, Russia. TOM KUNTZ
 When President Clinton goes to Beijing next year to reciprocate the Chinese President's visit this week, the salesman-in-chief's handlers will no doubt be up on Chinese protocol, including what to do when drinks are served. As "Chinese Ethics & Etiquette in Business" notes:
Foreign guests who are not familiar with the Chinese custom of seating should not rush to sit down. They should wait for the host to indicate where they are to be seated. At this point, the chief guest may get up and serve the host the first drink, who then reciprocates. Thereafter, others take turns offering drinks to both the host and guests. The official toast in China is Gan Bei, which literally means "dry glass," but is our equivalent of "bottoms up." The toast drink officially favored by government dignitaries is moatai, a fiery liquid made from sorghum. Generally guests are expected to gan bei on the first toast. Subsequent toasts -- and there may be many of them -- can be sipped. . . .
In Chinese etiquette, the host is permitted to merely sip his or her drink -- or not drink at all -- in order to stay sober and properly discharge the responsibilities of the host.
 But a guest may turn the tables on a host by calling a gan bei toast, in which case the host is expected to go all the way -- or come up with an acceptable excuse. . . .
But even if the host or some other party member proposes a "sip" toast and anyone in the party does a "bottoms up" it is considered a special politeness (or mark of camaraderie) for everyone to follow suit.
It is also custom for toasts to be proposed in between courses there are typically 10 or 15 , particularly before the mid-course soup dish. This practice generally has the effect of prolonging the meal and turning it into a noisy party. . . .
Refusing to drink an alcoholic beverage when being entertained by a Chinese host is regarded as impolite if not unfriendly, unless you have a good reason, such as an ulcer, high blood pressure, or an upset stomach.
Drinking in Japan may seem less formal, but the stakes are just as high, according to "Japanese Etiquette & Ethics in Business":
Drinking and enjoying the companionship of attractive young women in mizu shobai establishments "water business" establishments, meaning bars, clubs, etc. is an important part of the lives of Japanese businessmen. There are basically two reasons for their regular drinking. First, ritualistic drinking developed into an integral part of religious life in ancient times; from there it was carried over into social and business life.
Thus, for centuries, no formal function or business dealing of any kind has been complete without a drinking party (uchiage) (uu-chee-ah-gay) to mark the occasion. At such times, drinking is more of a duty than anything else. Only a person who cannot drink because of some physical condition or illness is normally excused.
The second reason for the volume of customary drinking that goes on in Japan is related to the distinctive superior-subordinate relationships between people and to the minutely prescribed etiquette that prevents the Japanese from being completely informal and frank with each other except when drinking.
Because the Japanese must be so circumspect in their behavior at all normal times, they believe it is impossible to really get to know people without drinking with them. Sober people, they say, will always hold back and not reveal their true character. They feel ill at ease with anyone who refuses to drink with them at a party or outing. They feel that refusing to drink indicates a person is arrogant, excessively proud and unfriendly. The ultimate expression of good will, trust and humility is to drink to drunkenness with your co-workers and with close or important business associates in general. Those who choose for any reason not to go all the way must simulate drunkenness in order to fulfill the requirements of the custom. . . .
Most Japanese businessmen, particularly those in lower and middle management, drink regularly and have developed an extraordinary capacity to drink heavily night after night and keep up their day-to-day work. Since they drink to loosen up and enjoy themselves, to be hospitable and to get to know their drinking partners, they are suspicious of anyone who drinks and remains formal and sober. They call this "killing the sake." . . .
Foreign executives should be very cautious about trying to keep up with their Japanese hosts at such drinking rituals. It is all too common to see visiting executives being returned to their hotels well after midnight, sodden drunk.
And if you have trouble holding your own in Japan, think of the fun you'll have in South Korea:
The big difference between Koreans and other Asians is that they tend to be more aggressive, more abandoned, in their drinking and in their expectations of others during drinking periods.
Drinking to Koreans is not just a pleasant custom engaged in for fun and relaxation. It is an important ritual, sanctified by religion and by the ages, that plays a key role in bonding and friendship ties. Anyone who refuses to drink with them, without having an acceptable excuse, is regarded as rude and insulting. . . .
Foreign guests invited to attend after-hours eating and drinking parties by their Korean contacts are also expected to sing. Some Koreans, particularly if they have been drinking heavily, simply will not take no for an answer. In any event, it is both courteous and good business sense to make an effort. In fact, doing badly is sometimes a plus because it results in a friendlier atmosphere. . . . As silly as it might seem, foreign business executives expecting to go to Korea should first lock themselves in their bathroom and practice belting out two or three oldies.
But beware of "excessive hospitality syndrome," the handbook on Korea advises:
Foreign business people in Korea most often encounter this excessive hospitality syndrome when they go out with their Korean friends and contacts and attempt to pay the bill at the end of a meal or drinking session. More often than not, one of the Korean members of the group will grab the bill and insist on paying. If the foreigner resists, the Korean will become physical, literally fighting for the bill if the foreigner continues trying to hold onto it. If there are several Koreans in the party and one of them gets hold of the bill first, the whole group will often fight over it.
Russia offers no respite to the constitution:
The average Russian has a high tolerance for alcohol and can drink the average foreigner under the table. Refusing a drink can be misinterpreted as an offense to the host and is a serious breach of etiquette. The visitor should be prepared to drink one or two small doses of vodka. Russians will pressure guests to continue drinking. Once a bottle is opened, Russians like to say, it must be finished.
But if you wind up with a hangover, there's the bracing cure of the banya, or public bath:
Good health begins with a good beating. Russians typically bring a vyenik (small tree branch) to the steam room and beat the body with it to open the pores of the skin, promoting sweat. . . .
One common method is to lie down on the bench in the steam room, developing a sweat. A friend takes the vyenik (sometimes two, one in each hand) and begins a light dusting movement from the toes to the head and back, which soon turns into a thrashing. . . .
There. Feeling better?

HEADLINE: Tentative Global Profile;
China Exports Its Own Uncertainty

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
CHINA exports so much to the United States that at times it can be hard to find a pair of shoes, a toy or an electrical appliance in an American department store that does not say "Made in China."
Yet China-made, most of the time, does not really mean Chinese. The goods that China ships out by the boatload do not look or feel Chinese. Unlike Italian fashion, French wine or American movies, most Chinese exports have nothing to do with Chinese culture. They are simply low-cost things that, as far as a buyer is concerned, could as easily have come from Madagascar. 
 As its exports suggest, China cuts a strangely tentative global profile for what is arguably the world's oldest civilization and unarguably its biggest emerging power. This is reflected in its leader, President Jiang Zemin, who arrives in the United States today for a weeklong visit, and in much more about China.
Take culture. China's historical contributions to the world are there all right, beginning with ancient innovations like paper and gunpowder. But the highly visible, truly Chinese cultural exports of today are essentially limited to drawing-room chinoiserie and takeout cuisine.
The reason is evident. China is poor and old. Its culture is conservative, glorifying virtues like patience, social grace and education. These are hard sells in an age more interested in youth and sex appeal.
As he tours the United States this week, Mr. Jiang no doubt would like to appear to be the head of a dynamic nation poised to lead the world in the next century. But China's role in the world, even as it grows economically, seems likely to be circumscribed by its the country's uncertainty about itself.
Outsiders often find China impenetrable, blaming its complex language or the Communist legacy that keeps the nation secretive and closed to outsiders. But another explanation lies in the musty nature of Chinese culture. Among the elements that compose China's complicated psyche today, two stand out: its insular, self-satisfied attitude, rooted in the ancient Chinese belief that the nation lay at the center of the world; and the deep sense of inferiority that came with the modern realization that China was actually far behind most of the developed world. Those two conflicting attitudes coexist in the minds of most Chinese, forming a cultural burden that is hard for Americans to grasp.
In the ancient world, Chinese emperors were accustomed to thinking that China was at the center of the universe, surrounded by tributary states like Japan, Korea and Vietnam. The illusion melted when Western gunboats turned up in China 150 years ago.
China's history over the past century and a half is a story of trying to come to terms with the West. Major political transitions keep mixing Western ideas with Chinese reality: The old imperial system fell to a republican government run by warlords; that fell to a socialist system run by the Communist Party; that is now falling to a capitalist system run by the Communist Party.
 
Self-Absorbed
After this long and involved progression, Chinese society favors the practical, shuns the romantic and is still far more interested in itself than in anyone else.
"Chinese seldom look at other cultures on their own terms, but always compare them to China," said Zha Jianying, author of a book on popular culture in China. "Why should the world care so much to learn from a culture like that? You can admire or borrow certain achievements, but still not feel attracted by its attitude, which is so self-centered."
Tibetan culture seems to have drawn more passionate adherents in the West in recent years than Chinese culture has -- consider Tibet's current vogue in Hollywood. This fascination may be partly attributable to Tibet's compelling political profile as an occupied land under Chinese domination, but it probably also stems from admiration for its intense, mystical religious devotion, a character lacking in Chinese culture.
Confucianism is still at the root of Chinese culture. And its teachings of obedience, social ritual and respect for elders are clashing with more modern notions of flexibility and directness, leaving many Chinese conflicted and uncertain.
Mr. Jiang personifies this uncertainty. Although 1997 has been the crowning year of his career -- he emerged as China's undisputed leader after the death of Deng Xiaoping last February, and presided over a seamless recovery of Hong Kong -- he is still extremely tentative, apparently feeling the need to consult widely with colleagues before taking positions on issues large and small.
With the Chinese leadership still highly secretive about its workings, Mr. Jiang's visit this week will probably offer American officials and citizens their first good look at him. Up to now, Mr. Jiang has been known primarily for his extreme caution in public, where he often reads from a prepared text even when he is regurgitating the party line. From Mr. Jiang's example one may conclude that the Chinese system rewards leaders for back-room consensus-building and scheming more than any ability to wow a crowd.
On the one hand, he comes off as smug and imperturbable, as though he cares only about matters Chinese and is quite prepared to ignore international concerns about human rights, the environment or trade disputes.
On the other, however, are hints of insecurity. Mr. Jiang's demand for the ceremony that awaits him at the White House -- Chinese officials insisted on a 21-gun salute, the red carpet and a state dinner -- attests to his need for formal recognition. He was badly miffed two years ago when, during a visit to the United Nations, the Clinton Administration tried to arrange an informal meeting at the White House. Mr. Jiang now is finally getting what he wants.
Today, China can look to Westerners like a fast-growing behemoth with a locomotive economy and a militaristic regime determined to get its way by any means necessary, even through campaign contributions abroad.
Such an exaggerated view overlooks many essential features of Chinese life, including overwhelming poverty, a disorganized economy and a fragile political system. It also obscures deeper cultural and social fissures that keep China mired in self-obsession and a sense of victimization at the hands of foreigners.
"They're caught at kind of the intersection of being a victim on the one hand and a major country on the other," said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China scholar at the University of Michigan. "Victims preach morality, always play a weak hand, always ask for you to accommodate to them to make up for past wrongs. Major countries have broad responsibilities, shared responsibilities for how the region and the world fare. The Chinese can't quite figure out where they are on this."

HEADLINE: Unhappy Returns;
Pity the I.R.S., the Tax Code's Whipping Boy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO many members of Congress, as to working stiffs and millionaires alike who dread contact with tax collectors, the Internal Revenue Service too often lives up to its caricature as an unresponsive, intrusive and vindictive bureaucracy.
"The power to tax is the power to destroy," Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican, said last week as he unveiled legislation intended to give taxpayers a fairer shake when they confront the I.R.S. and to improve the management of the tax-collection agency. 
 Mr. Archer, whose avowed goal is to "get the I.R.S. completely and totally out of the life of every American," may see the agency as an even more tempting punching bag than other legislators, some of whom had the temerity to say that the I.R.S. actually does a pretty good job. But his bill sailed through the Ways and Means Committee with little opposition on its way to the House floor, where it is likely to pass with an overwhelming bipartisan majority.
After some hesitation, Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill decided to support the bill. So did President Clinton, who had fought it -- primarily because it would dilute executive branch authority over the I.R.S. -- but reversed course as the political wind behind the legislation turned into a gale. His surrender all but insured that the measure would become law after the Senate takes up similar legislation, probably early next year.
Yet for all the crowing on both sides of the aisle about strengthening taxpayers' rights, there was also grudging acknowledgment that fixing the I.R.S. is the easy part, and that the real problem lies in the byzantine nature of the tax code itself. Over the years, Congress has found it easy to increase the system's complexity; the tax cut enacted last summer, for example, tripled the number of tax rates on capital gains and established a bewildering array of retirement and college-savings incentives. But Congress has rarely found the will to untangle the knots it creates.
Most of the code's complexity, of course, is there because Congress tried to make the system fairer, or to use it to encourage some social or economic good, or to make it more responsive to the needs of a constituency, whether a narrow special interest or a broad class of taxpayers. And once a tax break enters the code, its beneficiaries are loath to give it up; just listen to the hue and cry whenever eliminating the mortgage-interest deduction comes up.
But the more complicated the tax code, the more ways there are to interpret what is acceptable and what is a scam. That reality provides a good living for legions of accountants and tax lawyers, but it also imposes on the I.R.S. a role as enforcement agency as well as tax collector. A system that is based on voluntary compliance, and which gives taxpayers wide leeway to calculate their own tax liabilities, could hardly function without some kind of cop on the beat.
 
The Blood Trail
However menacing the I.R.S. might be, there are plenty of taxpayers who find advantage in a tax code of an organic nature, one that changes to fit changing economic and social circumstances. And Congress's enthusiasm for assailing the easy target presented by the I.R.S. is itself a recognition that changing the agency is much easier politically, and to defenders of the progressive tax system perhaps more effective as well, than adopting a tax code that wouldn't require such an intrusive enforcement agency.
"For all our whacking on the I.R.S., the blood trail comes back to us," said Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat, who was co-chairman of a bipartisan Congressional commission on the tax agency.
The problem is hardly a new one. In his new book, "The Decline (and Fall?) of the Income Tax," Michael J. Graetz, a professor at Yale Law School, tells of how Alexander Hamilton, the country's first Treasury Secretary, persuaded Congress in 1791 to place a tax on liquor, not to raise revenue but to encourage "social discipline."
"Politicians have been tinkering with the tax system ever since," Mr. Graetz wrote.
However well intentioned, such tinkering frequently creates unforeseen complications that are then addressed with, yes, more tinkering. The introduction of joint filing for married couples in 1948, for example, effectively created a bias against single filers, which was addressed in 1969 through the introduction of what became known as the "marriage penalty," which is now biting the growing numbers of two-income couples particularly hard -- and which Republicans are now proposing to repeal or to scale back.
The last attempt to streamline the tax system came in 1986, when Congress closed a host of loopholes and lowered top tax rates but never seriously considered adopting a new approach to taxation.
Today Capitol Hill is awash in competing proposals to "scrap the code," as the latest Republican rallying cry puts it. The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, is pushing for the adoption of a single-rate flat tax that would require a tax return no bigger than a postcard, an approach that Steve Forbes championed in his campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996.
 
A National Sales Tax
Mr. Armey has been staging debates around the country with Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, who is pressing for a national sales tax to replace the income tax. That approach, which is also favored by Mr. Archer, is one that would allow for total abolition of the I.R.S.
Not to be outdone, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader and probably the leading challenger to Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, has a plan that he says would put 75 percent of taxpayers in a 10 percent tax bracket.
But each proposal to dump or to radically alter the progressive income tax system has economic or political credibility problems. A flat tax system, with no deductions, would require the abolition of cherished tax breaks like the mortgage-interest deduction and would tend to shift the tax burden from the wealthy to the middle class.
A national retail sales tax would create huge incentives for cheating, while falling most heavily on people at the lower end of the income scale. And even if the problems of these plans could be overcome, as advocates of each insist is possible, the logistical difficulties of moving from one tax system to another in an economy of the size and complexity of the United States' could prove insurmountable.
Moreover, Republicans are also sorely tempted by the political appeal of just continuing to push through tax cuts under the current system. That temptation is growing along with the likelihood that in the next few years the Federal budget deficit could be wiped out by the strong economy, further freeing Congress from the constraints of fiscal austerity.
So while the debate about fundamentally changing the tax system seems likely to rage on at least through the next Presidential election, for now the country is stuck with the Internal Revenue Service and the system, based largely on voluntary compliance, that it administers.
For all the very real horrors that have been inflicted on taxpayers who find themselves in disputes with the I.R.S., the vast majority of Americans will never have any more than routine dealings with the tax collector, however much they hate having to turn over their money to the Government.
And tax officials proudly point out that the level at which individuals voluntarily pay their full tax bill -- about 83 percent, a rate that has remained steady for two decades -- appears to be the highest in the world.

HEADLINE: Wasted Energy;
Fuel Efficiency Falls, Just as More Is Needed

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN people are rich and fuel is cheap, when the weather is cold and the economy is hot, the United States can hardly resist indulging its appetite for energy.
That was the situation in 1996, when Americans tanked up even more extravagantly than usual. Total energy use grew 3.2 percent, according to the Energy Department, outpacing the nation's economic growth rate of 2.4 percent. 
 Last year was the first tick upward in five years, a deviation from a long downward trend in energy consumed per dollar of economic production. But while the Energy Department expects improvement in energy efficiency to resume and to prevail for 15 more years or so, the rate of improvement seems to be flattening -- just as nations concerned about global climate changes are pressuring the United States to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas produced by burning fossil fuels.
Last week President Clinton proposed a new plan for reducing emissions by offering American businesses incentives to cut them, siding with technological optimists who say Yankee ingenuity can meet the challenge -- perhaps with a subsidy.
But others say that to keep the growing American economy from pumping out more carbon dioxide, different incentives are needed. Economic behaviorists say a painful one may be required: higher energy prices. Economic regulators want tighter standards for manufacturers to produce more efficient cars and appliances.
The optimists say there are few technical barriers to further gains in efficiency. "The trends are historical, and they don't reflect what the real possibilities are," said Stephen J. DeCanio, an economics professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara who was senior staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan. But, he noted, when he and his wife shopped for new lamps, they couldn't find attractive models that took energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs.
 
Doing Good by Doing Better
"Today, two-thirds of the energy used to provide electricity is squandered in waste heat," Mr. Clinton said as he proposed to reduce emissions to the 1990 level over the next 10 to 15 years. "We can do much, much better."
Mr. Clinton's plan relies heavily on narrowly targeted incentives and subsidies for efficiency, and environmentalists and other nations' negotiators in talks on a new greenhouse-gas treaty said it did too little too late.
Indeed, the United States, which has 5 percent of the world's population but emits nearly a quarter of its carbon dioxide, is turning in an embarrassing performance as it falls short of earlier goals to cut emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
But was 1996's increase a blip on a graph, or a warning of a big problem ahead? Why did the economy suddenly become less efficient in its use of energy?
The most obvious factor was the extremely cold winter weather, a statistical oddity that made people burn more fuel to heat homes and offices.
Another way to burn more fuel these days is by driving big gas-guzzling vans, trucks and sport utility vehicles, some of which get half the gas mileage of the average sedan. The nation's fleet of vehicles is getting less efficient, and transportation is projected to overtake industry as the main consumer of energy, but the changes would not be expected to show up as sudden spikes in one year.
Another trend is the decline in efforts by electric utilities to persuade their customers to use less power. That practice spread for a while because power companies, whose earnings were regulated, were allowed to make money by spending on conservation instead of building new power plants. But with deregulation on the horizon, that strategy makes less sense to them these days.
For most people, saving energy still makes financial sense, whether or not they are concerned about the problem of global warming over the next century or two. Mr. Clinton gave the example of a sixth-grade class in Iowa that took out a $14,000 bank loan and installed conservation measures that lopped 70 percent off its school's energy bills.
"The savings were so impressive that the bank decided to upgrade its own energy efficiency," he said.
The next day, before a different audience, Mr. Clinton wondered aloud, "Why doesn't everybody do it? Why don't we even have a critical mass of companies doing it?"
Most experts say the answer is the price of fuel. "Gasoline is the cheapest liquid you can get next to water, and it's much cheaper than bottled water," said Llewellyn King, who has been publisher of The Energy Daily since the glory days of the oil cartel in the 70's, when prices rocketed and Americans went on a conservation spree.
Lindsay Audin, who founded a consulting firm, Energywiz Inc., after retiring as Columbia University's energy-efficiency manager last year, said, "Consumers do not have the financial ability to pay the upfront costs, or the financial understanding that investments in efficiency make money. Companies do not understand that energy efficiency is not a cost center, it is a profit center."
 
Understanding Economics
Only when energy prices go up is that sure to change, he said.
"Price matters," said Dan Becker, climate policy director for the Sierra Club, which has long called for stricter fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles.
"But Americans don't do great with amortization of costs. So it has got to be something that we know works. And the only thing we can think of that we know works is requiring that energy-saving technology be put on the things we drive, the things we use to heat our homes, the things we use to cool our food. We know that works."

HEADLINE: The World;
Come On Down To Sunny Libya!

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
TAKE a country that has languished under a quixotic colonel for about three decades, building up a reputation for terrorism along the way. Put this fair land under international sanctions, spiked by even tougher restrictions imposed by the United States, which has proved capable of enforcing them with bombs. No planes from the outside world can land there legally. Internal flights, with aircraft patched together in the absence of new spare parts, are risky. Isolation has faded the grand old hotels.
What does this country -- Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's Libya -- decide to invest in? Tourism. 
 International travel is a multibillion-dollar business, with nearly 600 million people taking pleasure trips every year, more than double the number in 1980. For Libya, tourism offers a lot, at least on paper. A third or more of international travelers visit the Mediterranean area, so why not add on the attractions of Libya? It has mirage-like, mud-walled desert cities, spectacular seaside Roman ruins and (having been an Italian colony) spaghetti. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former United Nations Secretary General, was once served macaroni by Colonel Qaddafi, who advised him that any wife who could not cook it should be divorced.
Furthermore, tourists often pay in hard currency, or can be required to. Above all, luring at least some of them to Libya could help the Government soften its pariah image, or so Libyans seem to hope. That was what they had in mind last week when Nelson Mandela of South Africa visited, clearly upsetting Washington.
 
Pariah
But "don't hold your breath waiting for Americans" is the advice to Libya from James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. Ordinary Americans are barred from travel there. The United States, Britain and France accuse Libya of blowing up passenger planes -- the destruction in 1988 of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland, killing 270 people, and the explosion that destroyed a French airliner over Niger the following year, with 171 deaths. Libya has refused to extradite suspects sought by the West, though it has contacted relatives of Pan Am victims in an effort to reach a settlement.
Yet even if the standoff persists for a very long time, there are no international sanctions that prohibit Libya from developing its tourist industry. With the help of the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the United Nations Development Program based in Madrid, Libya has just budgeted $895,520 for a professional survey of its potential by a London consulting firm, Rendel, Palmer and Tritton, one of more than half a dozen European bidders for the contract.
Nobody thinks this will be an easy project, least of all Jim Fletcher, who is in charge of developing Libya's tourism plan for the London consulting company. Not only is Libya an outcast, but it is also next door to Algeria, home of the world's most violent civil strife lately, where scores of innocents are slain regularly. Tunisia, wedged between them on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, has already found its efforts to expand tourism haunted by the Algerian monster.
A Muslim nation where alcohol is forbidden and modesty encouraged, Libya does not exactly have beach bums in mind -- which is probably just as well, since its beaches are portrayed as exceedingly hostile territory in the movie "G.I. Jane" with Demi Moore. Instead, Libya is going for what tourism types call the high end.
"We're not looking at mass tourism here," Mr. Fletcher said. "We're not looking at building mass resorts along the coast. We're talking about a Muslim country. Not a fundamentalist country by any stretch. But it has been closed to tourism since Qaddafi took over nearly 30 years ago. It is a big step to come into the 21st century."
The Libyans, not unlike the Bhutanese in their Himalayan isolation, are acting on the hunch that older, richer, more culturally sensitive travelers are the ticket to bigger earnings with less social disruption. Europeans, whose governments haven't imposed the same travel restrictions that Americans face, are already signing up.
 
Lap of Hardship
"There are a couple of small U.K. tour operators who take people in there to look at the cultural sites, and there is also some interest in the desert for adventure tourism," Mr. Fletcher said. "But in terms of market importance, it's really the Germans, the Italians, the French who make up more of the numbers."
A browse through the Internet suggests why. A Rome travel agency, for example, is touting the uncontested glories of Leptis Magna, a spectacular coastal Libyan archeological site where Phoenicians first settled, to be followed by Carthaginians, Numids and finally Romans, who built marble roads, a harbor, coliseum, theater and forum.
There are downsides to booking a holiday in Libya, and the web site promoter, JetSet, is up front about those. First, you have to arrive by sea, or overland through either Tunisia (as Mr. Mandela did last week) or Egypt, which has experienced deadly terrorist attacks on foreign tourists in recent years. Once in Libya, accommodations could well be spartan, with apologies to the Greeks.
"We will have camps in the open, early morning departures, light food and frugal breakfasts," the cyberblurb says. "The means of transport might break down and the program would have to be canceled or consequently modified. Therefore, we appeal to your group spirit and and your comprehension for the unforeseen events that may happen during the trip." Libya, it says, demands the "physically fit and morally ready."

HEADLINE: The World;
Reversing Roles in a South African Dilemma

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
THE arguments have been fierce and familiar: Affirmative action is only the smallest step toward redressing terrible injustice. Affirmative action is irredeemably divisive. Without the force of quotas, racism won't be dislodged. Quotas are anathema. And so on, in a debate that is not even close to resolution.
But in South Africa, the debate is new. And while the words sound like the struggle over racial preferences in the United States, the stakes in this nation, 88 percent nonwhite and hardly practiced in antidiscrimination law, make the Amercan experiment look puny. At risk, many here believe, is South Africa's very survival as a multiracial society. 
 If the pace of change here is too slow, it might lead to anger and frustration among nonwhites, tipping the country into the kind of violence that has devastated so many African nations coming out from under white dominance. Yet too much affirmative action and white South Africans, seeing no future for them here, might leave in a brain drain that most black leaders admit would threaten South Africa's future.
What people on all sides of the debate do agree on is that private industry's early efforts at leveling the playing field after 40 years of apartheid have been a disaster.
The tension in corporate corridors is palpable. Eager to hire any black South African who had an education and job experience, corporate South Africa -- an almost-all-white boys club -- went on a buying spree after President Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990.
 
Soaring Careers
Trying to anticipate the change that a new, black-majority Government would bring, companies hired and poached from each other in a frenzy that had a limited pool of black managers and professionals job-hopping at a staggering rate. With each move, there were new cars, new bonuses, promotions and inflated salaries. There was, however, little or no training.
Not surprisingly, the backlash has been swift. Whites complain that blacks who are underqualified make much more money than they do. Recent surveys have shown a growing number of chief executives officers declaring that affirmative action isn't working. And progress in bringing more blacks into the managerial levels of the work force has pretty much come to a standstill.
"The news is that there is no news," said Angus Bowmaker-Falconer, who compiles a yearly survey on employment equity in association with the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business. This year, he said, "Things look pretty much as they did two years ago."
The subject of affirmative action is likely to split almost any gathering along racial lines, often infuriating blacks who cannot believe that with so much injustice to make up for, whites aren't embracing programs meant to redress inequality.
In South Africa, it is not an issue of the majority agreeing to help out a minority group. Here, it is the vast majority of this country's citizens who were systematically denied education and jobs. And it is this majority that now controls the Government.
Indeed, the Government is on the verge of unveiling affirmative action legislation. But it has taken a long time to study the issue and has chosen a path that most consider a careful balancing act -- a carrot-and-stick approach that does not include quotas.
There are some who question whether affirmative action even needs to be a race-based policy. Rachel Jafta, who lectures on economics at the University of Stellenbosch, suggests that any policy that reaches out to poor rural areas or bolsters training and education is already furthering affirmative action goals, without bringing in any racially divisive component.
 
Side Effects
"We have to weigh the costs and benefits," Ms. Jafta said. "There are so many side effects with race-based programs. We could be jeopardizing a united South Africa."
Others argue that South Africa may not be able to afford the costs of affirmative action.
Tony Leon, the head of South Africa's liberal, largely white Democratic Party, which has always opposed apartheid, says that the costs are potentially enormous. Packages already given to whites to induce them to leave Government jobs, he said, had cost the country more than $200 million.
Mr. Leon is also concerned about nepotism creeping in under the flag of affirmative action in the redistribution of government jobs. In some areas, he said, what has happened is not affirmative action but a full family employment act. "What you have is literally the wives, the cousins and the sisters getting jobs," Mr. Leon said.
Certainly the Government, while not following any set affirmative action policy, has been a tremendous source of new jobs for blacks. In some areas, it appears to have gone beyond what the law allows. For instance, earlier this year, a lower court decided that a Justice Department policy to reserve about 30 senior jobs for nonwhites was illegal.
Under the Government's new legislation, each business, even relatively small ones, will be expected to file an affirmative action plan outlining targets. Each will be reviewed for reasonableness. For instance, since there are few black certified accountants in South Africa, a company might be excused for suggesting small numbers in this area.
"We don't expect corporations to grab someone from the bush and put him in the boardroom," said Loyiso M. Mbabane, the Director of Equal Opportunity from the Department of Labor.
 
Rewards and Fines
Companies that do well are expected to have an advantage in getting Government contracts. Those that don't make progress could be fined.
Still, some affirmative action advocates say the Government is being too soft in not requiring quotas. They point out that interest in the issue seems to depend on the Government's own action in the area, and that business simply reads the Government's signals. Before the election, for instance, there was lots of interest because it was widely believed that the new Government would swiftly impose an affirmative action law. In one survey of 65 chief executive officers, more than half said it was the top "strategic issue facing the new South Africa."
After the election, when the Government did not move immediately to institute new laws, affirmative action quickly slipped to seventh on the list. The most recent surveys show it back up to No. 2.
Certainly apartheid left a footprint that will be hard to sweep away. Most of South Africa's wealth is concentrated in the hands of whites, who make up about 12 percent of the population. At the same time, 70 percent of all black people live below the poverty line. About 50 percent are illiterate. Even after all the hiring of the last few years, blacks make up only 4 percent of the managerial ranks in private companies.
"If you say leave it to the goodwill of the people," said Bonang Mohale, a board member of the Black Management Forum, a nonprofit advocacy group, "it will not get done."

HEADLINE: Crashing in Asia;
Paper Tigers, Paper Miracles

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN the history of the Asian crash of 1997 is written years from now, people will probably have long since forgotten the accusation by Malaysia's paranoid-sounding premier, Mahathir Mohamad, that the source of the problem was a Jewish conspiracy to level Asia's booming economies. By then it should be clear whether Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican and chairman of the Banking Committee, was accurate or blowing smoke when he declared that the dramatic fall of the Hong Kong market Thursday was a "lesson for all freedom-loving people around the world" of the dangers "now that the Communist Chinese have taken over" Asia's most vibrant center of capitalism.
By then, historians may have concluded that John Kenneth Galbraith's diagnosis was closer to the truth, even though he was talking about the causes of another market crash, a bigger one, in 1929. Then, too, there was a search for conspiracies and plotters. But in the end, Mr. Galbraith concluded, the real cause was a delusional hubris about America's economic power, fueled "by the seminal lunacy which has always seized people who are seized in turn with the notion that they can become very rich." 
 There has been a lot of that hubris in Southeast Asia for the better part of a decade now -- and it has led a lot of very smart people, investing cash drawn from around the globe, to do a lot of stupid things. With every book entitled "Asia Rising," with every news article projecting stupendous economic growth, with every talk show about the decline of the West, the markets climbed higher.
Virtually everyone playing in the markets knew that the banks in Thailand were lending money for office towers no one was actually occupying. They knew that Malaysia was building a Silicon Valley long before it had trained engineers to fill it. They knew that investors in Hong Kong were lining up to buy shares in "Red Chips," mainland Chinese firms whose only real asset was that the company's president was the cousin of someone in the Chinese leadership.
 
Follow the Broker
But when the market keeps rising, when your broker keeps repeating that the next century belongs to the Asian Tigers, it is easy to justify pouring in more and more cash.
That is why the first victim claimed by the currency speculators -- Thailand -- never had a chance. The Thais had become the weakest link in the chain, forever finding excuses not to implement the austerity measures that were desperately needed, like closing more than 50 banks linked to prominent politicians.
"These guys are in a state of shock," Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore, said recently. "They can't believe it happened it to them. They thought only sleepy Latin Americans had currency crises."
Then other nations throughout the region began explaining why they were different from Thailand -- more disciplined, less corrupt, better regulated. It was a little like listening to a New Yorker explain to himself why the mugging that just went down three blocks away could not happen in front of his own building.
In this case, the muggers were emboldened. Speculators make their fortunes sniffing out hidden inconsistencies between the value of a currency (or a sky-high stock market) and the underlying fundamental strengths of the country. Then they plunge into that chasm, betting billions against the local currency or stocks and forcing the government to choose between preserving their exchange rate (usually by jacking up interest rates) and saving the economy.
Once Thailand surrendered, calling in the International Monetary Fund for a bailout, Malaysia and Indonesia were next. The Malaysians fought back, though Mr. Mahathir was forced to kill off his expensive pet projects; the Indonesians surrendered.
 
Model Economy
What happened in Hong Kong last week, though, was something completely different. Malaysia and Thailand are still fundamentally poor nations; Hong Kong, while tiny, has a per capita GNP that rivals the United States'. Its markets are the biggest south of Tokyo. It has long been the West's idea of a model economy for the rest of Asia -- no trade barriers, little corruption, well-funded banks, a Government with plenty of financial reserves to battle the speculators.
So why did the speculators attack? Because once everyone else in Southeast Asia devalued their currencies, making their goods cheaper, Hong Kong suddenly looked like a phenomenally high-cost place to do business. (Just count the empty hotel rooms.)
While the Government spent $3 billion to $5 billion battling the speculators, the prospect of a long siege wiped out a lot of that remaining hubris. "I lost the equivalent of five Mercedes," one investor whimpered. The red chips got hit the hardest; some lost half their value over the past month.
And halfway around the world, the ripples hit quickly. By late Thursday, Mexico and Brazil were falling, too -- in a selloff that only got worse on Friday -- for fear that they are the next natural targets.
But as Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who knows from his long years on Wall Street what it feels like to be on the wrong side of a bear market, said, "markets go up and markets go down," and sooner or later Asia will rise again.
The big question is what happens to the man who can't wait: President Jiang Zemin of China.
Mr. Jiang, who arrives in the United States today to begin a weeklong state visit, has staked his political future on his ability to bring the Chinese economy into the 21st century. That means shuttering hundreds of thousands of state-owned enterprises that lose billions of dollars a year and turning the survivors into world-class competitors.
The problem is that to do so requires billions of dollars in capital. Much of it was going to come from China's new pearl, Hong Kong.
"Hey, they wanted to take back the center of Asian capitalism," the American head of a large brokerage in Hong Kong said Friday morning. "Well, here it is. All his."

HEADLINE: Re-elect Mayor Giuliani

 BODY:
This year's mayoral campaign has been, by any standards, a disappointment. The Democratic nominee, Ruth Messinger, has criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani endlessly, but failed to give the voters a sharp sense of her own political philosophy. Ms. Messinger, who has a long and distinguished career in local politics, deserves to be remembered for her previous service to the city rather than for this uninspiring race. But even if she had run a model campaign, it is hard to imagine how she could have made a convincing argument for getting rid of Mr. Giuliani. Despite the many disagreements we have had with the Mayor over the last four years, we endorse his re-election enthusiastically.
The critical problem with the Democratic campaign became apparent at the first mayoral debate, when Ms. Messinger tried to deny that New York's quality of life had improved over the last four years. She was arguing against the voters' own sense of reality. Crime is down dramatically. New jobs have been created in the private sector. The welfare rolls are smaller. The city has a budget surplus. The school system has a new, more rational structure. Tourism is skyrocketing, and the city's reputation as a good place to visit, live or do business has improved dramatically. 
 Each of these achievements is subject to caveats. Crime is down across the country. But under Mr. Giuliani, the improvement has gone beyond a mere reduction of felonies, to a higher expectation of civility. New Yorkers no longer apathetically assume that they have to put up with aggressive panhandlers, squeegee men or parks full of makeshift housing encampments. Most residents have an increased sense of control over their neighborhoods, and this is most critical in poorer sections of the city. Low-income black and Latino families are no longer expected to reconcile themselves to gunfire in their streets and drug dealers on their doorsteps.
Mr. Giuliani's fiscal record has been helped along by a booming national economy, which produced budget surpluses during the last part of his term but did not end the long-term boom-and-bust pattern of the city's finances, or the huge projected deficits a few years down the road. Nevertheless, the Mayor scored some impressive successes. He made hard choices during his first years in office. Unlike his recent predecessors, who also knew how to cut when times were tough, he did not return to business as usual once the economy improved. The head count in city agencies has not ballooned back to its pre-austerity level. He kept his promise to reduce taxes with modest, targeted cuts aimed at encouraging business growth.
When it comes to economic development, though, Mr. Giuliani's biggest achievement was his battle against organized crime at the wholesale food markets. New York has long suffered from the perception that the city is overrun with crooked unions and extortionate industries under mob control. The war to clean up the Fulton Fish Market and Hunts Point Produce Market, and even the Mayor's insistence on forcing new management on the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy, had a critical symbolism. Coupled with the dramatic reforms in the carting industry and the unions working at the Javits Convention Center, the Mayor's initiatives were a giant leap in convincing businesses that they can come here without worrying about overt and hidden shakedowns.
New York was ready for a dramatic turnaround when Mr. Giuliani took office, and that need became even more urgent when a new Republican Congress began shutting down the old pipelines of economic support to cities and the poor. A place this big, with so many jealously guarded bits of political turf, does not turn easily. New York, like many cities, favors mayors who bring forceful and at times obsessive leadership. Mr. Giuliani projects that quality. Ms. Messinger, despite her deep understanding of city issues, seems more professorial or bureaucratic in temperament.
Mr. Giuliani's combative temperament is a bit like nuclear fission. Harnessed in the right way, it is a tool for progress, drilling through previously impervious bureaucratic and political barriers. Some of Mr. Giuliani's well-chosen targets have included the Port Authority, the State Legislature and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. His pugnaciousness is less attractive when it is aimed at an individual whose only sin was to make a legitimate criticism of the administration. The public got another sampling of that knee-jerk inclination to lash out at opponents recently when the Mayor delivered a divisive assault on Ms. Messinger for failing to finish the route of the Columbus Day parade.
The best and worst of Mr. Giuliani's style showed in his fights over education. The public school system was virtually ungovernable when he took office, with impossibly complicated lines of authority and a culture of non-achievement in many districts. The Mayor has little real power over the schools, but his over-the-top behavior in starving the education budget, persecuting the former chancellor and terrorizing the school board created a sense of crisis that did bring about the impetus for change. We cannot buy into Mr. Giuliani's claim that his performance was a carefully calculated tactic. However, it did focus public attention on the problems long enough to get real reform, and we believe he is sincere in his intention to create a better learning environment for the city's children over the next four years. Still, it is not an experiment we would like to see tried very often. Instead of being improved, the school system could very easily have been shattered.
Due to term limits, Mr. Giuliani will have at most another four years at City Hall. If he is re-elected, his opponents will be less willing to roll over, and he will have to win future victories with more negotiation and less bluster. He will also need to attract a new cadre of top managers to fill out the ever-shrinking circle of advisers and commissioners. Mr. Giuliani does not share the spotlight readily, and after four years of his administration, there are few stars and many yes-men and -women at City Hall.
Ethics has, surprisingly, been a weak spot for Mr. Giuliani, who seems to believe that his administration is too honest to need much regulation. Mr. Giuliani's tenure has been blotted by instances in which he failed to abide by standards he demanded of others, from his insistence on using city funds to pay for what were basically re-election ads to his refusal to acknowledge that there is any problem with maintaining two politically powerful allies as advisers to the administration while they work for a lobbying firm that does business at City Hall.
Given Mr. Giuliani's overall record and the weak campaign Ms. Messinger has waged, pointing out these faults does not argue against the Mayor's re-election. But Mr. Giuliani's ability to moderate his style may make all the difference in the legacy he leaves behind. If he curbs his worst tendencies and gives full rein to his energy, determination, intelligence and independent thinking, he may go down in history not simply as a competent politician who rode out some favorable economic and social trends, but as a Mayor who turned New York City around and reshaped its future.

HEADLINE: Governor Whitman's Voodoo Economics

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I applaud Jennifer Preston for her Sept. 28 column, "It's Not the Economy; It's the Monthly Bills." 
 In her portrayal of New Jersey residents struggling to make ends meet with the highest property taxes and highest auto insurance rates in America, Ms. Preston thoroughly exposes Christie Whitman's voodoo economics during the last four years. Voodoo economics is what George Bush called Ronald Reagan's trickle-down disaster in the 1980's, which caused our national debt to quadruple by the end of his term. The interest payments of more than $330 billion a year are a fiscal calamity in the making.
Christie Whitman's problem is also voodoo economics. By mortgaging New Jersey's future with the $2.76 billion bond plan -- which will take 35 years and $12 billion for us and our children to pay back -- Mrs. Whitman and her rubber-stamp Republican Legislature have put our money into the pockets of wealthy investors and crippled the state's ability to provide services in the coming years.
When will people realize that we were better off before Mrs. Whitman? For example, my property taxes have skyrocketed close to $1,000 during the last four years (because of Mrs. Whitman's reduced state aid to schools and municipalities), yet my state income taxes dropped just $90. Compare this middle-class picture with that of Mrs. Whitman, Steve Forbes and her other greedy Republican millionaire cronies: they reap a windfall on the state income tax reduction and each year pay a paltry $50 in property taxes on thousand-acre estates zoned as farms!
Most people don't realize that government bonds are taxes, too. They are liens against future taxes. Mrs. Whitman is using state bonds as a smoke screen to hide what she is really doing: putting us and our children in debt for generations -- and filling the mismanaged $620 million hole in her current budget.
Together with Mrs. Whitman's condoning 11 rate increases in New Jersey's auto insurance during her first term -- and her fiscal irresponsibility causing us also to have the highest property taxes in the country -- the $2.76 billion bond fiasco was the last straw. It is urgent that we all remember in November.

TRADE
The Chinese Connection
The United States trade deficit deepened in August to $10.4 billion, the widest gap since January, driven by a record $5.2 billion gap with China. Benefiting from a strong economy and a higher dollar, American importers have been stocking up on Chinese toys and decorations for the Christmas shopping season. William M. Daley, the Secretary of Commerce, referring specifically to China, said, "The mounting trade deficit remains a major concern for this Administration."
 
BOEING
Business Is Good. That's Bad.
Boeing stunned Wall Street by announcing it was suffering from too much of a good thing. Deluged with orders for its commercial planes, the company has not been able to keep up, despite hiring 14,500 workers this year. Earlier, it halted production of 747's for 20 workdays and 737's for 25 workdays because of parts shortages and other production problems. Now Boeing, the leading aerospace manufacturer and the biggest United States exporter, says it will take a charge against earnings of $1.6 billion for the third quarter, resulting in a loss, and a $1 billion charge for the fourth quarter. 

EARNINGS
Money Keeps Rolling In
In its tumble, the stock market shrugged off positive third-quarter earnings news in a number of industries. I.B.M. surpassed estimates with a 6 percent gain. Three big oil companies -- Mobil, Chevron and Phillips Petroleum -- also exceeded expectations, as did Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications. Pepsico, in its first quarter since spinning off its restaurant business, reported a 42.7 percent increase in profit from continuing operations, with international business on the rebound. Four drug makers -- Bristol-Myers Squibb, American Home Products, Schering-Plough and SmithKline Beecham -- reported gains. Several big banks, including Chase Manhattan and Wells Fargo, exceeded expectations. Citicorp's per-share earnings also beat estimates, but an $889 million charge for a restructuring caused overall earnings to fall 45 percent.
 
AT&T
New in the Hot Seat
C. Michael Armstrong, left, the head of Hughes Electronics, will be the new chairman and chief executive of AT&T, succeeding Robert E. Allen, who is being forced to yield the posts. With smaller competitors stealing customers and management in turmoil, Mr. Armstrong will be one of the nation's most closely watched executives. Analysts were enthusiastic, both about Mr. Armstrong and because AT&T's earnings, although down from a year earlier, exceeded forecasts. . . . And General Motors said it had no intention of selling Hughes, which named its vice chairman, Michael T. Smith, to succeed Mr. Armstrong.
 
TAXES
Overhauling the I.R.S.
With citizens outraged by well-publicized Senate hearings into harassment and abuse of taxpayers by overzealous agents, the Clinton Administration yielded to political reality. It will back a bill, offered by Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the Ways and Means Committee, that would create an outside board with broad authority over the I.R.S., strengthen the rights of taxpayers and shift the burden of proof in tax court to the Government. No longer will taxpayers be guilty until they prove themselves innocent. Passage is expected by the House this year and the Senate in 1998.
 
MICROSOFT
U.S. Enters Browser War
The Federal Government asked a judge to order Microsoft to stop forcing makers of personal computers to include its Internet browser with its Windows 95 operating system. The browser, which Microsoft contends is part of Windows 95, competes with Netscape's browser for Internet access. Attorney General Janet Reno said that Microsoft was in violation of an antitrust agreement and that the Justice Department would seek a fine of $1 million a day if the company did not change its policy. Microsoft, disagreeing, said it would vigorously contest the petition.
 
SMOKING
Nicotine Goes Electronic
Will a nation that replaced the boom box with the Walkman and that made cell phones an indispensable part of the streetscape welcome electronic smoking? Philip Morris, having spent $200 million to develop a microelectronic "smoking system," tentatively called the Accord, is betting it will. It's not the Humphrey Bogart look, or even the Marlboro Man's: Cigarettes will be puffed inside a beeper-sized, battery-powered box that eliminates the smoke and ashes from the end. Addicts can inhale with fewer coughs and complaints from those around them, but they will still exhale smoke. Tests will begin over the next month.
 
ACQUISITIONS
A White Knight for ITT
The ITT Corporation accepted a friendly, $9.8 billion offer from Starwood Lodging Trust, an $82-a-share deal that apparently ends Hilton Hotels' 10-month-old hostile quest for its rival in the hotel and gambling industry. Hilton bid $8 billion, or $70 a share, up from an original $55 a share. With the addition of ITT's Sheraton brand, Starwood would become the world's biggest hotelier. . . . Barry Diller, right, is moving again into the thick of entertainment programming, as his company, HSN Inc., agreed to buy Seagram's USA and Sci-Fi cable channels and most of Seagram's Universal Studios television production company for $4.1 billion. Seagram and its chairman, Edgar M. Bronfman Jr., left, are also expected to benefit in the complex cash-and-stock deal.

HEADLINE: Nike Supports Women in Its Ads but Not Its Factories, Groups Say

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A coalition of women's groups has attacked Nike as hypocritical for its new television commercials that feature female athletes, asserting that something is wrong when the company calls for empowering American women but pays its largely female overseas work force poorly.
The commercials show women saying they will be stronger, healthier and more independent if they are allowed to play sports. 
 In a letter to Nike's chairman, Philip Knight, the coalition, which includes the National Organization for Women and the Ms. Foundation for Women, wrote, "While the women who wear Nike shoes in the United States are encouraged to perform their best, the Indonesian, Vietnamese and Chinese women making the shoes often suffer from inadequate wages, corporal punishment, forced overtime and/or sexual harassment."
Eleanor Smeal, president of Feminist Majority, a research and advocacy group, said: "The message in the empowerment ad is strong, but there's a disconnect between that message and the way Nike pays and treats its workers, especially its women workers. The sweatshops, which all of us thought were a thing of the past, are back again. And just like the feminists at the turn of the century fought them, it's incumbent on us to do the same."
Nike's factories have become a target for labor rights groups, which have repeatedly said that they pay too little and force workers to toil in poor conditions. Global Exchange, a human rights group in San Francisco that has often attacked Nike, seized on the new television commercials to rally women's groups behind a new effort to criticize the company.
The coalition is calling on Nike to let local independent monitors inspect factories in Asia and to increase pay, suggesting that its wages in Vietnam be raised to $3 a day from $1.60 a day. Vada Manager, a Nike spokesman, said the women's groups misunderstood Nike's role in Asia, adding that its factories in Vietnam, Indonesia and China pay considerably more than do most factories in those countries.
"Nike has created some 500,000 superior jobs with good wages around the world in developing economies," Mr. Manager said. "The job opportunities that we have provided to women and men in developing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia have provided a bridge of opportunity for these individuals to have a much better quality of life."
Ms. Smeal said, "We think it's great they're providing jobs. It's just that the level of the wages should be increased and the working conditions improved."
Others who signed the letter to Nike include Alice Walker, the author, Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, the Black Women's Agenda and the Coalition of Labor Union Women.
The coalition's letter said many of Nike's workers in Vietnam could "barely afford three meals a day let alone transportation, rent, clothing, health care and much more." But Nike officials pointed to a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers that concluded that Nike's daily wages in Vietnam were four times the cost of obtaining three meals a day there.
The letter also faulted Nike for physically abusing workers, referring to an incident in Vietnam in which a manager punished workers by making them run laps in the sun.
Mr. Manager acknowledged occasional abuses and said the abusive managers had been dismissed. He added that the company's factories had passed inspections by Andrew Young, the civil rights leader.

HEADLINE: Reversing Course on I.R.S., Clinton Takes the Wind Out of Republican Sails

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Only a few weeks ago, Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy director, left no doubt that President Clinton vociferously opposed a Congressional plan to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service, assailing it as "a recipe for conflicts of interest" that would be "a serious step backwards."
So it was a stunning moment this week when Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin stepped before a wall of television cameras outside the Capitol to deliver the news that Mr. Clinton would embrace the plan. Mr. Rubin insisted that the legislation had been rendered acceptable by small but crucial concessions he had won from Republicans. 
 For a White House that is often defined by its agility at measuring the public mood and responding (or readjusting) accordingly, Mr. Clinton's reversal on the I.R.S. measure was both remarkable and routine.
Brazen as it was, the turnabout was a textbook example of the decision-making process in an Administration where even senior officials concede that political considerations often eclipse policy commitments.
After more than a dozen interviews this week with central players from the White House and Congress, it became clear how Mr. Clinton was prodded into reversing course out of fear that Republicans could use the issue against Democrats in the 1998 elections to gain the upper hand on an array of tax-related issues.
Just as important was the worry that competitors like Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, and Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, could use the matter to gain advantage over Vice President Al Gore in seeking the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000.
Once again, Mr. Clinton frustrated his foes by co-opting an issue that threatened him politically. Some in the Administration would argue that it is a President's job to yield to public opinion.
But the turnabout was reminiscent of his dramatic changes of course on issues as diverse as gay men and women in the military, grazing fees on Federal lands, welfare overhaul, taming the deficit and a campaign to vaccinate children nationwide.
Several White House officials said there was a consensus early on among most of the principal players that Mr. Clinton would have to reach an accommodation with Congressional Republicans. But they said that Mr. Rubin, who commands great respect on economic matters and is known for being territorial, was adamant about his objections to the bill.
 
From Political Fight To Bipartisanship
Finally, after a long weekend of negotiations with members of Congress, Mr. Rubin decided late last Sunday that he had wrung as much out of Congressional Republicans as he could, given the political realities. So on Tuesday he went across to the White House to deliver to a meeting of the President's senior advisers the welcome news that he was willing to sign onto the legislation, which was racing toward overwhelming bipartisan approval by the House Ways and Means Committee.
Then several officials blurted out at once that Mr. Rubin should announce the decision in a show of support that, in the words of one participant, "would reinforce that this was not imposed on him."
A few hours later, Mr. Rubin, forceful but not appearing particularly enthusiastic, announced the Administration's new position, steering clear of what officials feared would become a major political millstone.
"Now, rather than an issue that divides the parties," said Mark Penn, a White House pollster, "it becomes another example of bipartisan cooperation."
While politics prevailed, White House officials and other influential Democrats conceded that Republicans were far in front of the White House in seizing on the I.R.S. issue.
Dick Morris, the former Clinton adviser who was an expert at stealing issues from Republicans, said the internal White House dynamic was "Rubin against the world." Explaining that there had been absolutely no political advantage to Mr. Rubin's intransigence, Mr. Morris asserted: "For the Democrats to have resisted would have been as crazy as the Republicans' Medicare position is."
 
A Technical Issue Becomes a Fixation
In pure policy terms, the wrangling was over whether the Administration would accede to a central element of the Congressional plan for improving the performance of the tax agency: establishing a board, composed largely of private citizens, that would have broad authority over the I.R.S.
But the issue exploded from one of seeming technicalities to become something of a public fixation last month when the Senate Finance Committee held hearings that highlighted abuses of taxpayers by overzealous revenue collectors.
"Every once in a while in American politics, you find an issue that just goes right to the central nerve system of the American public, and this happens to be one of them," said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster. "To be fallow in that field would be extremely dangerous for the White House or for any political entity because it is something that people care about."
Though Mr. Clinton had long proposed I.R.S. changes -- "We have footprints in this area," said Rahm Emanuel, a senior White House adviser -- other Administration officials acknowledged that they had been slow in recognizing the potency of the issue.
Yet the measure seemed to have such momentum that the chief Republican tax writer in the House, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, decided he would not negotiate over the bill with the Administration.
Instead, Mr. Rubin was left last week to spend hours on the phone negotiating over relatively technical details with Kenneth J. Kies, the staff director of Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. It was hardly standard protocol for a Cabinet Secretary's dealings with Congress.
On a technical level, Mr. Rubin achieved much of what he wanted. Language in the original bill that restricted the Treasury Secretary's authority over the I.R.S. Commissioner was rewritten to Mr. Rubin's satisfaction, as was a provision that could have been interpreted to give the board authority over the law-enforcement activities of the agency.
Mr. Rubin also got deleted from the bill language that would have stripped the President of the right to name the I.R.S. Commissioner.
Still, it was not much of a victory; Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who supported the bill and acted as an intermediary between Mr. Rubin and Congressional Republicans, said the measure's authors intended all along to give in to the White House on that issue.
In the end, the bill still contained exactly what the Administration had opposed: a board dominated by private citizens with considerable powers over the I.R.S.
But as last weekend drew to a close, Mr. Rubin thought that he had fixed the biggest problems, and he was well aware that he had little political leverage to push for more concessions. Not only was Mr. Archer refusing to negotiate, but Mr. Gephardt was signaling that he was going to come out in favor of the bill.
One Clinton adviser said White House officials feared that "the bipartisan shove by Gephardt" would bring along most House Democrats, and leave the Administration almost completely isolated in opposition to a bill with tremendous popular support.
"We recognized from the hearings that there was a very potent political issue that was going to be used by Republicans against us if we didn't respond," said an aide to Mr. Gephardt, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"It didn't take a pollster to watch the I.R.S. hearings and figure out we had a problem." Referring to the White House, he added, "Usually, they're more nimble on this since they poll every day."
Advisers to Mr. Gore insisted that the Vice President was not overly concerned with Mr. Gephardt's eclipsing him, because he could point to his own efforts to make changes at the I.R.S. through his reinventing Government initiative.
Though Mr. Rubin seemed focused on fighting for a policy victory, he is hardly politically tone deaf. He has been with the Clinton Administration since the beginning, and worked as the White House's economic policy coordinator, where he constantly negotiated political and policy trade offs, before moving to the Treasury Department.
So with an eye to the political reality, Mr. Rubin decided that he had pushed Republicans as far as they were likely to go -- and far enough for the Administration credibly to claim a victory. And he was clearly trying the patience of the more politically minded White House staff.
Asked to name Mr. Rubin's allies in the White House on the I.R.S. matter, one official deeply involved in the discussions could name only Sylvia Matthews, a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Clinton who had been Mr. Rubin's chief of staff. "There were not a lot of allies in the White House," the official said.
In fact, there had been a growing sense among White House officials that for several weeks Mr. Clinton, while trusting Mr. Rubin, was eager to get a deal. Senator Kerrey, a primary author of the proposal to set up an I.R.S. board, had held a long phone conversation with the President in early October.
Mr. Kerrey said that he had given Mr. Clinton details of the legislation and that the President had become more enthusiastic as he listened. A senior Administration official said Mr. Clinton subsequently told his staff to find a way to support the Congressional plan.
"His message was, 'Why are we beating ourselves over the head trying to find differences when there is a possibility of consensus?' " the official said.
 
Rescuing the President From Potential Debacle
Though a few Clinton advisers groused that the episode demonstrated the triumph of politics over policy in the Clinton White House, most of those interviewed boasted that, once again, they had rescued the President from what could have been a debacle. An added benefit for Mr. Gore, one White House official said, was that "if there was any good politics in there for Kerrey and Gephardt, it went away."
By this weekend, Paul Begala, a Presidential counselor, had declared victory. "I have no doubt there are some in the Republican Party who hoped to demagogue this issue for months without any real reform," he said.
"And I'm sure that they are quite frustrated that the President's commitment to real reform has allowed him to take one more issue away from them and make it his own. They thought that they had something that would last 18 months in bashing the I.R.S. It did not even last 18 days."
But Mr. Kerrey noted that the outcome was not without political pain for Mr. Clinton. "The President made the correct decision and a difficult decision," he said, "given that he knew there would be stories about him caving in."

HEADLINE: Economic Analysis;
Can America Buy Time for Asia?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The financial shakeout in Southeast Asia raises an urgent question: Are American consumers willing to buy more goods from places like Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to help revive their economies?
Asian shoppers, traumatized by plunging stock prices and falling currencies, are already spending less. To make up the shortfall, Southeast Asia will need to increase its exports -- especially to the United States, the most robust of the major industrial economies -- until its own consumers regain the wherewithal and confidence to buy more of what their industries produce. 
 "Certainly, I expect greater exports from Southeast Asia," said Dan Rodrik, an economist and trade specialist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. "They will be sending us, or trying to send us, growing quantities of what the region produces, which is everything from garments to electronic products to auto parts to appliances."
The Asian financial crisis touched millions of Americans last week when a severe plunge in the Hong Kong stock market spread to Wall Street, driving down the Dow Jones industrial average by 319.24 points on Thursday and Friday, or 4 percent. But once the Asian markets calm down -- and they showed signs of doing so on Friday -- the longer struggle will be to find enough buyers for the goods produced by Southeast Asia's growing, modern industries.
"If you want to put a favorable spin on it," said Albert Wojnilower, senior economic adviser for the Clipper Group, a Wall Street firm, "you can argue that Americans, because of their strong economy, seek to buy more than their own economy can produce, so they can reach out safely for more imports."
The big lure for Americans is likely to be lower prices for imported goods from Southeast Asia. The financial crisis has considerably weakened Asian currencies against the dollar. This means that Southeast Asian exporters can cut their prices in terms of dollars and still generate enough revenue to cover production costs -- and profits -- in less valuable Asian currencies. In the process, the American inflation rate stays down.
But there is a downside for the American economy. "The negatives are the potential for downward pressure on wages in industries that compete with Asian imports and the political ramifications of a continually rising trade deficit," said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management and a former trade official in the Clinton Administration. The nation's merchandise trade deficit is running at a record annual rate of more than $190 billion, 11 percent of which is with Southeast Asian countries.
The financial crisis started in Thailand early last summer when that country's currency, the baht, fell sharply in value. It has already slowed economic growth and spending in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. Real estate prices have plunged, unemployment has risen and loan repayment has faltered. In such circumstances, consumers naturally tend to reduce their spending.
So far, the pressure from Asia for Americans to buy more Asian goods is barely evident in American trade statistics, which are available only through August. The data show small recent rises in imports from Indonesia and Thailand, compared with 1996 figures, but no unusual changes in American purchases from elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Imports from this region account for 15 percent of the nation's imports, not including shipments from China and Japan.
The anecdotal evidence is mixed. Clothing imports from Indonesia, for example, rose sharply this summer, even though apparel imports have been shifting from Asia to the Western Hemisphere, particularly to Mexico. "Indonesia is putting on a big push to sell us more," said Jay Meltzer, director of Johnson Redbook Service, which tracks retailing.
United Technologies, on the other hand, insists in briefings for Wall Street analysts that its Asian customers are still strong buyers of its products -- elevators and air-conditioners made at its own factories in Asia. "We have not noticed any drop in demand, period," said Peter Murphy, a company spokesman. "We are still exuberant."
Exports from the United States to Asia constitute the other aspect of this dynamic. Office buildings, factories and public works projects were under construction when the financial crisis hit, and while many are still going forward, others have been cut back. That raises the possibility that tens of millions of dollars in orders for heavy equipment, machinery and architectural services from the United States might be cut back.
Some argue that such cutbacks could hasten a slowdown in the American economy. Through August, exports to seven small Asian nations totaled $62.4 billion, or 14 percent of the United States' total exports this year. But others are optimistic.
"The point is that we have an enormously diversified export base," said Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist at the World Bank, "and therefore any decrease in sales to one particular country or even to a couple of countries is not going to have that much impact on aggregate U.S. exports."

HEADLINE: For Hillary Clinton at 50, Yet Another Beginning

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
There was a certain unintended twist in the setting for Hillary Rodham Clinton's meeting with journalists and child care experts this week. She gathered the group in the White House Map Room, a locale immortalized in the recently discovered videotapes of her husband's glad-handing coffees with big-money Democratic donors.
But if she was aware of it, she did not let on. Wasting no time on formalities, she plunged into her subject, Thursday's conference on child care policy, another of the Clintons' continuing earnest forums on national needs. Sitting beneath a World War II map of the "Estimated German Situation, 1 May 1945," Mrs. Clinton opened a thick black briefing book and dived right into what she called "a frontier issue." In the ensuing hour she stayed strictly on task, not letting the fact-filled discussion stray to other subjects. 
 So this is the "reborn" Hillary Clinton, famously turning 50 on Sunday, a policy diva in a baby-blue tailored suit and a frosted-blond pageboy. She is very much the same Hillary Clinton who has been the object of public affection, fascination and fury over the past five years: enigmatic, clever, frustrating and remarkably composed.
But her return to the spotlight marks a carefully plotted repositioning, after a period of low visibility that began with the unprecedented appearance of a First Lady before a Federal criminal grand jury.
The White House years have left her a bit chastened, perhaps, and her tactics have changed -- she will no longer direct a gigantic policy-making enterprise like the failed health care task force of the first term. But her starring role in the child care conference this week demonstrated that she will continue to be a central policy voice in the Administration.
It is no coincidence that the child care symposium came the same week as Mrs. Clinton's birthday, which is being treated as an unofficial coming-out party for the second-term First Lady.
And it is no accident that the birthday is being celebrated with a policy-making forum. This was how Mrs. Clinton wanted it, despite her friends' efforts to mark the occasion with a nostalgic trip down Hillary Lane. Friends and staff members have been presenting her with a gift a day for the 50 days leading to her birthday. More than a hundred pals are preparing a commemorative book of letters and reminiscences that will be presented to her on Sunday. On Monday, the City of Chicago will put on a day and night of festivities that will include visits to many of her childhood haunts, an occasion one friend described as "all the stations of the cross." And on Tuesday, she does "Oprah."
Although reaching the half-century mark is a traumatic passage for many people, Mrs. Clinton is little given to introspection or self-doubt, her friends say. She is obsessed not with her identity, but with her calling. Her mission, as she sees it, is to advance the status of women and the fortunes of her husband.
"This is a person, as long as I've known her, that has this strong sense of responsibility, a very moral sense that you should do whatever you can do," said Ann F. Lewis, a longtime friend of Mrs. Clinton's and now the White House director of communications. "She has always felt that way and she thinks of that as her role in the White House, too."
Mrs. Clinton is struck by how little time she has remaining on the global stage as First Lady and has begun to think about how she can carry on her good works after leaving the White House 39 months from now, said close friends who have spoken with her recently.
Her thoughts have turned to the best platform from which to address her lifelong concerns, whether a political office, a foundation or a university chair, friends say. But she is also consumed by such mundane matters as finding and furnishing a home, after having spent almost all of her married life in public housing.
"The really fun thing about thinking about her future is that nobody knows," said Mary Steenburgen, an actress and longtime Arkansas friend of the Clintons. "This is a time when both of them have literally the world open to them at a relatively young age. It's exciting to them, and scary, too."
For today, however, Mrs. Clinton seems energized by her husband's re-election, freed for now of the crippling scrutiny that preoccupied her during much of the first term and liberated by her daughter's departure for college. Mrs. Clinton has assumed again an ambitious and visible role in promoting her husband's agenda, and her own.
She is enjoying record approval ratings and hopes to translate her current public esteem into concrete accomplishments across a canvas of policy interests, from improving the state of the nation's child care to fostering women-run business ventures around the world.
In just the past 10 days, Mrs. Clinton has given a major speech on domestic violence and family planning in Argentina, appeared in a public service television spot urging women to get mammograms, presided over the child care conference and unveiled a painting by Georgia O'Keeffe that will hang at the White House.
Later this month she will travel to England and Ireland; November will take her for 10 days to Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.
Her busy schedule and narrowed agenda represent a public reanimation of Mrs. Clinton. They come after 18 months of near-invisibility that began at one of the lowest points of the first Clinton term -- her appearance before a Federal criminal grand jury in January 1996, when she strode into a Federal courthouse in a military-style greatcoat to answer questions about the mysterious loss and rediscovery of her law firm billing records.
Since then, Mrs. Clinton's tight-knit circle of aides has painstakingly plotted her return to the spotlight.
"This has been a disciplined and focused comeback, the result of a series of very careful choices," said a senior White House aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Instead of doing 50 things, she's chosen a few high-profile projects and foreign trips with children and women's issues as the central theme. They have picked their spots carefully. And it's worked. They have done a really good job of repositioning her."
This official said the public persona of the second-term Mrs. Clinton is very different from that of the first. "No longer is she the co-President and the co-Vice President of 1993," this official said. "But she's not Barbara Bush, tea and cookies, either."
Mrs. Clinton has traveled widely in her years in the post-health care wilderness, visiting Africa, China, the Indian subcontinent and Latin America. On all her trips, she concentrates on promoting the health, welfare and economic advancement of women and children. She took on the Chinese Communist Government in Beijing over child labor and women's rights and the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina over birth control and violence against women.
She is more outspoken, it seems, abroad than at home. But the rapturous reception she has received around the globe appears to have emboldened her to take a more visible role at home.
"She has taken more interest in international policy since Beijing, the agenda of educating girls, small business loans for women," Ms. Lewis said. "She will be doing more foreign travel. She can really make a difference when she goes into a country; she puts those issues higher on the agenda."
Although Mrs. Clinton has been subjected to some ridicule over her advocacy of a "politics of meaning" and her consultation with personal-growth gurus, she continues to believe that public and private life must be grounded in spiritual principles. She has broadened her thinking to embrace the concept of a "civil society" based on shared faith and mutual respect.
The Czech writer and President, Vaclav Havel, has been an inspiration and an adviser for that concept, Mrs. Clinton's associates say, and his influence can begin to be seen in her speeches. Mrs. Clinton and a small circle of aides are beginning to plan a yearlong global celebration of the arrival of the millennium, one that will center on more closely knitting together the human family.
"We cannot leave the raising of our children, the inculcating of values to the mass media and the consumer culture," Mrs. Clinton said in a speech in Buenos Aires 10 days ago. "We have to do a better job through our churches, our families, our civic associations. We have to build up civil society to reach out to all young people to help them understand why so many of you have fought so long and so hard for the values, the rights and the privileges that now in my country can be too easily taken for granted."

HEADLINE: Jiang Says U.S. Is Too Pushy for Democracy

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 25

 BODY:
President Jiang Zemin, on the eve of his visit to the United States, said today that America's efforts to impose its political principles on China were unfair.
Mr. Jiang said he welcomed the cooperative spirit of President Clinton's China policy speech delivered Friday, yet he took issue with Mr. Clinton's affirmation that the United States would press China to open its political system. 
 "Trying to impose a uniform system of democracy everywhere, that in itself is not democratic," Mr. Jiang said at a news conference.
Apparently anticipating tough questions from members of Congress and other Americans about China's repressive human rights record, Mr. Jiang spoke at length about how different views should be tolerated and how China should be allowed to determine its own speed for political reform.
"I hope Americans will understand that American democracy and freedom are not absolute concepts," Mr. Jiang said. "People from different countries will choose their own paths to democracy."
Economic and political reform should complement each other, Mr. Jiang said. He reiterated China's stance that it is in the process of advancing "socialist democracy," meaning a system of mostly indirect elections, largely controlled by Communist Party authorities, at local, municipal and national levels.
The main reason for not employing direct elections, Mr. Jiang said, is that China is not ready. "Of 1.2 billion Chinese people, more than 100 million are illiterate," he said.
He confirmed earlier Government statements that China will sign the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but did not mention a companion charter on civil and political rights.
Mr. Jiang, who has evidently been brushing up his English, mixed phrases into his Chinese as he expressed respect for American history and culture. "There are a lot of things we can learn from America," he said.
Asked how he planned to handle protests in cities he is to visit, Mr. Jiang said he expected his American hosts to keep them under control.
"I was invited by President Clinton," he said, "so it will be up to the United States to handle these events."

HEADLINE: Mandela Presses for Neutral-Nation Trial of Lockerbie Suspects

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: EDINBURGH, Scotland, Oct. 25

 BODY:
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa pressed Britain today to let two Libyans accused of blowing up an airliner over Scotland stand trial in a neutral country.
Justice cannot be done if Britain insists on trying the suspects in Britain or the United States, he said at a news conference during a meeting of Commonwealth leaders here. 
 Mr. Mandela set off controversy this week by visiting Libya en route to Scotland to support Libya's plan for the two men to stand trial in a neutral country.
Britain and the United States are demanding the extradition of the pair, suspected of killing 270 people in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Libya for more than four years to force compliance.
Mr. Mandela said he had not raised the matter with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, but he added: "I have never thought in dealing with this question that it is correct for any particular country to be the complainant, the prosecutor and the judge at the same time. Justice cannot be said to be done in that situation."
He noted that British relatives of Lockerbie victims backed a trial in a neutral country, as do some American relatives, as well as the Organization of African Unity, the Arab League, the Islamic Conference and the Nonaligned Movement.
British officials were adamant that there was no question of accepting the Mandela proposal, even if a foreign court abided by Scottish law. "We believe they should be brought to justice here or in the United States," one said.
He said the Government took the views of the relatives seriously but saw "formidable obstacles" to a trial in a neutral country. The International Court of Justice in The Hague has been mentioned as one possibility.
It would be necessary for the British Parliament to pass primary legislation, and any third country would struggle to find the expertise in Scottish law needed at short notice to permit a meaningful trial, the officials said.
They said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had underlined Britain's determination to insure a free trial by inviting representatives of African and Arab countries to come to Scotland to study its legal system and observe the trial.
"We wholly reject any suggestion that it would be an unfair trial," Mr. Cook told ITN news on Friday. "Scotland was where the murders took place. Scotland is the place where the trial should happen."
But Mr. Cook will come under further pressure when he meets Jim Swire, the father of one of the victims, on Sunday. "I will be telling Mr. Cook that we should have a trial in a third country under Scots law and that he has been badly advised in his opposition to this," Mr. Swire told The Scotsman newspaper.
The Commonwealth also decided to continue Nigeria's suspension from the group, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy of Canada said. It went into effect two years ago after Nigeria executed nine human rights activists. If Nigeria does not make progress toward restoring democracy by next October, it faces the threat of expulsion or oil embargo.
Much of the gathering of leaders of 54 nations dealt with less sensitive economic issues. Prime Minister Blair was quoted by a spokesman as saying liberalization of trade barriers was "essential for long-term global growth."
But Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan said, "Free markets might be the rage of our times, but the rules are strangely wayward."

HEADLINE: Thousands of Women Share Wounds, and Celebrate

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25

 BODY:
For LaChanda Bartell, as for many of the other women here this weekend, the Million Woman March was about something larger and more elusive than issues like education and political empowerment on the 12-point program developed by march organizers. More than that, it was both about healing the wounds that come with being a black woman and about celebrating the special joys that come with that as well.
"There are a million plus reasons to be here," said Ms. Bartell, 37, an owner of a printing company and clothing boutique. She arrived here on Friday from Detroit in a van with other women whose interests ranged from strengthening families to politics. "But I think healing is the number one thrust that has jelled the women to say I want to be part of this," Ms. Bartell said. "Healing mentally, physically, spiritually. 
 "I also believe the women are going to come to an awareness that it's not so difficult to come together," she said, "that through mobilizing we can make accomplishments that reflect how strong so many of us are."
Sharing that sentiment, tens of thousands of black women from across the country traveled here by bus, airplane, train and van on Friday and today to meet one another and to send the world a message that they were united and had a definite agenda for the 21st century.
The top priority for many of the dozens of women interviewed was to find ideas they could take back to their towns and cities to help young people and the scores of women who struggle to raise families alone.
As dawn broke over the city today and a light rain fell, the mood was festive. Women began marching to a backdrop of drums and vendors hawking T-shirts, buttons, caps, and red-black-and-green liberation flags.
Patricia Coleman of Washington, 48, a medical technologist, said: "First thing, we have to learn to respect ourselves. With that, you can just go on from there. It's something we can pass on to the kids. I think parenting is a real big issue. We have so many young women having children and the parenting skills are lacking."
Gloria Graves, 44, a real estate broker who came here from Detroit in the van with Ms. Bartell, said: "I thought it was very important that we as black women come together in prayer and unity and the belief that we can bring back the family unit that has been lost. I wanted to meet other strong black women who had the same agenda and be united. It's been just great."
"It's about time we as black women got together," said Lynda Overby, a 40-year-old mother of four and grandmother of three who lives in Philadelphia and works as a surgical technician. "I think this march is really for our children, our future, a chance to look at topics like children and education."
Farmina Williams, 35, a hairstylist who is expecting a fifth child in January, made a 19-hour trip by car from Tulsa, Okla., with her husband, a friend and her 17-year-old sister-in-law.
"For me, it's very spiritual," Ms. Williams said of the march. "If I meet someone and I see where their mind is, it helps me see where my weaknesses are. I think the main issues here are children and schools." Her friend, Vondie Harding, an administrative assistant who is the single mother of four children said: "There were several things on the agenda that attracted me -- the C.I.A. investigation into drugs, funding for black schools. The reason foremost was the common ground black people share in poverty. This was an opportunity for me to move on it, to put an effort behind it." Kazembe Williams, Mrs. Williams's husband, said he attended the Million Man March in Washington in 1995 and was so overwhelmed by the love he experienced that he was determined that his wife be part of a similar event.
"The world knows the black woman has been the backbone of every struggle," Mr. Williams said.
Jawir Mumin, who with her sisters owns and operates a fine arts and crafts marketplace in Columbus, Ohio, said she came here to experience sisterhood and to encourage more black women to go into business for themselves. "As sisters, we understand the value of sisterhood and the value of women in the community," said Ms. Mumin, who is 41.
"I think economic security and entrepreneurship are important because they represent freedom and self-expression," Ms. Mumin continued. "The new welfare reform does not only affect women on welfare but it brings to light issues affecting all women as it puts a lot of low-income women in the workforce."
Yolanda Lee, who drove from Columbia, S.C., with friends, said she wanted to meet other women who were struggling for professional success in a society that still can be hostile to the aspirations of black women. "I'm here because I support women's rights," said Ms. Lee, 43, a histology technician. "I'm a single, professional woman, and we need something positive. I'm interested in the speakers, Winnie Mandela in particular."
Devona Gonsalves, one of her friends from Washington, said she had attended the Million Man March and thought this was an opportunity to show what women can do. "This march is a way to show it's not a negative thing to be a woman and black," said Ms. Gonsalves, a 27-year-old records manager in the State Department. "Or a woman, period."
Edwina Moten, her 3-year-old niece, Brieanne Glanvile, by her side, estimated that she was one of about 900 women who had come to the march from Kansas City, Mo. Ms. Moten, 42, teaches high school students with disabilities. Ms. Moten said she was especially interested in all issues related to young people and planned to talk with other women about what they are doing.

HEADLINE: China Leader, on Milestone Visit, Might Not Always Follow Script

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 25

 BODY:
When President Jiang Zemin of China wants to impress someone, he often breaks into song.
At dinner with the Philippine President, Fidel Ramos, in Manila last year, Mr. Jiang surprised his host by showing that he knew the words, in English, to "Love Me Tender." The two men sang a duet. Then Mr. Jiang sang "Swanee River" solo, saying afterward that it was his favorite tune. 
 Mr. Jiang, 71, lacks the charisma and authoritative manner that might be expected of a man who stands at the helm of the world's most populous nation and its fastest-growing economy. In most public settings, he appears stiff and awkward, and prefers to follow a script.
But his penchant for unexpectedly displaying his artistic talents -- Mr. Jiang also likes to play piano and recite poetry -- points to an unpredictable, wacky side as well.
Mr. Jiang sets out on Sunday on his first state visit to the United States, a week-long trip that begins in Hawaii. Billed as a milestone in United States-China relations, and the most important visit by a Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping went to America in 1979, the trip is also a chance for Mr. Jiang to introduce himself on the world stage now that he has consolidated power.
When Mr. Jiang was named general secretary of the Communist Party in June 1989, the common view in Beijing was that he was a political lightweight and he would be lucky to last three years in the post.
In 1997, he passed his eight-year mark, and succeeded Deng as China's paramount leader when the patriarch died in February. Mr. Jiang then presided over a smooth transition from British rule in Hong Kong and called a Communist Party Congress that, mostly, went his way.
During those eight years, Mr. Jiang has successfully isolated and controlled several potential rivals, including a former President, Yang Shangkun, and his brother, Yang Baibing, who were building a powerful faction in the army.
Yet for all his successful political maneuvering, and good luck this year, Mr. Jiang is not regarded by Chinese officials as particularly able or insightful, nor is he as deeply knowledgeable about economic matters as his predecessor, Zhao Ziyang.
Mr. Jiang is often wooden in official gatherings. When he first met President Clinton at a conference in Seattle in 1993, he used up most of the allotted 60 minutes for their meeting by reading a prepared text.
By limiting himself to restating positions that have already been worked out, Mr. Jiang suggests an unwillingness or a lack of authority to make decisions. Some Chinese officials say his eagerness to sing and play piano in both public and private settings reflects a desire to show off and compensate for his political shortcomings.
"Jiang has a deep desire to make everyone like him," said a Shanghai official who served under Mr. Jiang when he was Mayor of Shanghai in the 1980's.
Mr. Jiang does, however, rely on a trusted group of advisers. First among them is Zeng Qinghong, often called Mr. Jiang's "eyes and ears" for his role of collecting political gossip and swiftly identifying any anti-Jiang moves by rival leaders.
It is hard, many Chinese officials argue, to identify anything that Mr. Jiang believes in or stands for. He likes to recite sections of the Gettysburg Address and Declaration of Independence in English, yet here too he has appeared more interested in showing off his knowledge of such texts than in expressing any serious opinion about them.
Born near Shanghai to an educated family, Mr. Jiang was taken into the care of an uncle who was later said to have died as a "revolutionary martyr" with the Communist army, where a network of revolutionary veterans later proved instrumental in promoting Mr. Jiang's career.
As an engineering student in Shanghai just prior to the Communist-led revolution in 1949, Mr. Jiang was exposed to popular Western music, taking a particular liking to Benny Goodman.
After the Communist takeover, Mr. Jiang first worked in mid-level management jobs at a soap factory in Shanghai, a sign that he was unlikely to have played a significant role in the Communist underground, which generally rewarded its volunteers with important jobs after the revolution was won.
Mr. Jiang won the chance to study in Moscow at the Stalin Automobile Factory for a year, and then spent years as a mid-level official in the machine-building industry. He was not purged during the Cultural Revolution, a badge of honor for many reformist officials once they were reinstated to power.
Wang Daohan, a comrade of Mr. Jiang's stepfather, helped Mr. Jiang win the prestigious job of Mayor of Shanghai in 1985, where Mr. Jiang mastered the art of tending to the elder men who ruled China and who traditionally came to Shanghai for part of the winter.
One defining moment in Mr. Jiang's career came in the middle of the two-month period in 1989 when, as in Tiananmen Square, student-led demonstrations filled the streets of Shanghai, where he had become municipal party chief. His test came from a liberal newspaper called the World Economic Herald.
Led by a gutsy editor, the newspaper published a special issue that was sympathetic to student demonstrators, effectively thumbing its nose at Mr. Jiang without technically breaking any rules. Mr. Jiang dithered for several days, seeking guidance from his superiors in Beijing, and finally ordering the newspaper closed, a move apparently intended to demonstrate his toughness to Deng.
When many writers and university professors spoke out against the newspaper's closing, Mr. Jiang telephoned several of them to ask that they "understand my position," implying that he was simply following orders, said a former Shanghai official.
Then he dispatched a trusted aide to reopen the newspaper under a new editor, telling associates that he actually supported its right to publish, with the right supervision. As it turned out, journalists at the newspaper refused to go along with the new management, and attempts to revive it were abandoned.
"That was the essence of Jiang," said a Chinese journalist in Beijing. "Closing it, opening it, trying to seem tough to one side, and compromising to the other."
Mr. Jiang's once-in-a-career chance came soon thereafter, as an intense power struggle erupted in Beijing between Deng and Zhao Ziyang, who was then head of the Communist Party, over how to cope with the widening demonstrations. When Mr. Zhao was fired and placed under house arrest, it was widely expected that his job would go to one of the next men in the Party hierarchy, Prime Minister Li Peng or the Security Service boss, Qiao Shi.
To the amazement of virtually everyone, Deng and his fellow elders settled on Mr. Jiang, clearly a compromise candidate, and a weak-looking one. When he moved to Beijing, Mr. Jiang was said to have been unable to bring more than a few aides with him, leaving him ill-equipped to conduct the fierce political infighting that goes on in Zhongnanhai, the secluded compound where senior leaders live and work.
In his early years at the helm of the Communist Party, Mr. Jiang operated in the shadow of Deng, and many of Beijing's political cognoscenti believed he would fall swiftly after Deng's death. The two leaders previously chosen by Deng to succeed him, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, were each sacked.
Mr. Jiang was fortunate that Deng survived eight years, giving the new leader time to expand his power base. He added the title of President in 1993. Eventually, Mr. Jiang promoted so many colleagues from Shanghai to high posts that Beijing leaders began to complain that a "Shanghai faction" was wielding too much influence.
By the time Deng died last February, Mr. Jiang was apparently ready. As he prepared for the Communist Party Congress last month, he recognized that he needed some kind of decisive political move at the Congress, to prevent it from being themeless.
Until this year, the leadership seemed unable to make any difficult decisions about how to handle the biggest obstacle to economic reform, the elephantine state sector. But this year Mr. Jiang pushed through just that, with a broad plan to shed state control over medium and large enterprises by selling them.
At the same gathering, Mr. Jiang was also able to outmaneuver Mr. Qiao, one of his main rivals, forcing him to step down from the party's Central Committee.
Mr. Jiang's wife, Wang Yeping, is retired from her position at an electrical engineering research center in Shanghai, and appears in public rarely. Their two sons, work in Shanghai, one at the Shanghai Metallurgical Research Institute and the other at a computer software company.
These days, a staple of Communist Party political culture is the site visit, where a national leader goes to a factory or university or hospital, and local officials in charge offer special arrangements, knowing that a career can be made or broken in a few seconds with the word of a senior official. When Mr. Jiang goes for a visit, many work sites know how to prepare.
"Everyone knows you need three things to make a successful Jiang visit," said the Chinese journalist. "One is to let him show off his English or Russian; second is to make him sing, preferably with a pretty young woman; third is to let him play the piano. If you have all those three, he will be very happy."

Heroic, or Just Quixotic, Messinger Tilts in Populist Tradition

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
Quiet heroism was in the air the other night at Holy Apostles Church in Chelsea. Its congregation has not only fed 3.3 million meals to homeless people in the last 15 years, with the help of thousands of contributors and volunteers, but it rebuilt the 154-year-old Episcopal church after a ruinous fire in 1990.
The main speaker at a reception celebrating those achievements, held in the luminous white nave of the little church, was Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, a politician almost as down on her luck, politically speaking, as the men, women and children the church looks after. 
 You would not have known it from the fierce rallying cry that she issued, a cry that carried echoes of Bryan and Truman and Humphrey and all the other Democratic tribunes of the dispossessed; a cry of a kind seldom heard in the party of Bill Clinton; seldom heard, for that matter, in a city and a state where Roosevelt and Lehman and their followers once made "liberal" a shining accolade, not an epithet, and only episodically heard in the campaign of Ms. Messinger, the Democratic nominee for mayor, as she struggles to find a strategy to save herself from burial by landslide.
Never mind. That night, Ms. Messinger gave them the old-time religion, fierce and undiluted.
"What does it say about this city," she demanded, "that two years from the end of the century, more and more people need to turn to resources like the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen? In the richest city in the richest country on earth, how can it be that every month, 73,000 people are turned away from pantries and soup kitchens unfed, 45,000 of them children, when it would only cost the municipal government $2 million, in a budget of more than 30 billion, to insure that no one would be turned away? And the money is not found?"
Those questions, based on statistics her opponent would challenge, crystallized Ms. Messinger's campaign against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
As did her comment notable for its insistent moralism in a time of political pragmatism: "When some people are doing so well, it is wrong for others to go hungry and have no place to live."
Hers is the hardest kind of campaign -- a "yes, but" campaign against a popular incumbent, an attempt to make the case that while things are better for most people, they are not better for all. That, she says, is unacceptable.
At its best, the campaign blooms with outrage, though it lacks specifics. She seldom talks about where she will find the additional dollars she promises to spend, neither proposing cuts in program A to finance program B nor advocating tax hikes.
Ms. Messinger does not argue with statistics that show crime dropping precipitously over the last four years, on Mr. Giuliani's watch; she contends that the improvement has been bought, in part, at a cost of increased police brutality, and rejects as "hogwash" the contention that you can't have one without the other.
She does not belittle the Mayor's efforts to curb the growth of gangs through the use of sophisticated police methods; she contends that they are not enough, and that young people must be given alternative outlets for the steam of adolescence. She accuses the Mayor of eliminating after-school programs for 280,000 students, something she describes as folly.
She does not question the prosperity that has been generated by the boom in Wall Street; she contends that it must be more evenly distributed.
"This city's best-kept secret is the people who've been downsized, squeezed out of jobs," she said at another campaign event last week, a "town meeting" in the social hall of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Jackson Heights, Queens. "Unemployment in this city is almost 10 percent, twice the national average.
"It's not enough to put your thumbs in your suspenders and say, 'Wall Street's doing great; executives are getting six-figure bonuses.' It's not enough to give tax breaks to the corporations. How about small businesses?"
That burst of populism drew applause from the audience, a modest one of about 65, including a dozen officeholders and party officials. Small as it was, it was one of the better crowds of Ms. Messinger's campaign, which has had trouble generating excitement. One reason was evident that evening: the sole camera present was for Korean television, rendering the event invisible on television in the city.
The strain of playing catch-up is starting to show in Ms. Messinger's entourage. People blame her problems on the news organizations. They rail against prominent Democrats like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, calling them "sell-outs" who have done little to help her. But the candidate keeps plugging away, like Sisyphus, at her daunting mission.
"I know the style has changed, even in New York," she said in a conversation in her campaign van. "The people who set the political style -- who are they? -- they say it's not productive, dangerous, you risk your political neck when you talk about the government making a difference for people who need help. It's not fashionable to talk about putting roofs over poor people's heads."
She knows Mr. Giuliani is a formidable opponent, though she derides him as an autocrat who lacks the capacity to negotiate. She concedes that it is "very hard to get any response" to some of her main campaign themes.
"People see the signs of prosperity," she said, "so they think I must be exaggerating when I talk about unemployment. The ones who are hurting think it must be their own fault they aren't part of the boom. Giuliani has people feeling good."
The words spill out with passion, and the ideas are laced with statistics and anecdotes. She is a better speaker than Mr. Giuliani, when she is on form, and she talks earnestly and easily with voters about their problems. But she is not the Mayor, she is not on television, and she lacks the magnetism -- the money of a Rockefeller, the looks of a Kennedy -- to offset those handicaps.
Ms. Messinger's No. 1 priority is education, she says. Not coincidentally, it is also among the electorate's prime concerns, according to polls by The New York Times and others. She is frustrated that employers have not rallied to her, because "they know," she said, "that the jobs of the future will require what city schools are not delivering."
"Our schools are in gross distress," she told the group in Queens, and she blamed it on the man she calls "Rudy." (He describes her, coolly, as "my opponent.") The Mayor, she said, had cut $6 billion for education from the projected budget of the Board of Education, although Mr. Giuliani has called the Board's budget requests bloated. Ms. Messinger promised, like so many before her, to rebuild battered school buildings, reduce class sizes to a maximum of 25 and make sure students can read.
That part of her message, unlike the others, appears to be getting across. The latest Times poll shows her leading Mr. Giuliani among parents and, by a slightly larger margin, among parents with children in the public schools. More than two-thirds of all respondents said the Mayor was paying too little attention to the schools.
But whether that is enough to persuade voters to abandon a popular mayor is another question.

At a news conference at Sylvia's, a restaurant in Harlem, when asked if former Mayor David N. Dinkins had the power to reinvigorate Ruth W. Messinger's candidacy: 

"I can't evaluate the other side. All I can do is do what we're doing. And we're going to reach out to all communities. And we're going to campaign very much the way the city's been governed for the last four years, which is one city, one standard. Everyone in the city is entitled to have me reach out to them. And people are going to have to decide if that's what they want for their future."
 
RUTH W. MESSINGER
On Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, while campaigning in the eastern Bronx with State Senator Larry B. Seabrook:
 
"If you -- we, the people of the city -- allow this man to be elected, nothing that we have seen yet tells us where he is headed next. He'll be a lame duck Mayor the day he gets re-elected, if we allow that to happen. He's made it quite clear he thinks a great deal of himself. He thinks he has so many other options coming down the road. He's positioning himself for those options with the national Republican Party. Now, you think he'll pay more attention to our schools in the next four years? Ridiculous. You think he'll pay more attention to the unemployment? Why should he?"

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Meet the Occasionally Gentle Giants: The Two Sides of Four Linebackers

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
Jessie Armstead says football almost gave him an identity crisis. Writing is one of his hobbies.
Corey Miller says fatherhood is his most important job. He watches "Barney." 
 Scott Galyon teaches school in the off season. He wonders why people don't return his smile more often in line at the grocery store.
Corey Widmer plays classical piano daily, though he wishes his left hand were more adroit. "Something like Chopin is tough on me," he said recently.
Tame bunch, these Giants linebackers.
And when they're not pursuing their other interests, they're out chasing quarterbacks and running backs hoping to slam them into the ground, delivering a blow with such force that perhaps the football, or even a helmet, might spurt free.
In the modern world of pro football, even linebackers, the traditional standard-bearers of the game's malevolent underpinnings, have all their teeth and most of their marbles. So it's no surprise that the Giants linebackers, at the center of a resurgent Giants defense, embrace the two-faced concept of their lives as well as any in the National Football League.
"It's a brutal world out there on the field," Miller said last week as the Giants prepared for today's game with the visiting Cincinnati Bengals. "But that doesn't mean you have to be an animal off it."
So Widmer heads for his piano to calm down, where he composes his own music. "My melodies can be somber, with a classical type of tone," he said after a recent practice, standing beside the locker where he piled the pads and other armor of his job. "It relaxes me. I'm going to go into a recording studio and record some of it. Because in my head when I play my music on the piano, I can hear the whole symphony -- the woodwinds, the trombones, the flutes, the strings."
Armstead, the star of the group who is having a Pro Bowl-caliber season, has been known to head for a different keyboard in his spare time.
"I was editor of my high school newspaper," Armstead said. "And in college at Miami, I had an English teacher who pushed me to write some articles that ended up published down there.
"She said to write what touches you. I wrote about when I tore up my knee. She liked what I did and asked me to write some more. I enjoy it."
Galyon went back to his hometown of Seymour, Tenn., last winter and taught economics in the high school there. "I used N.F.L. contracts and the salary cap as examples for some lessons," he said. "People back home are pretty fascinated with that. And, they want to know what it's like living in New York."
In Seymour, which Galyon said has one traffic light, he explained to friends that things are a little more frantic in his new neighborhood.
"It's just a shame everyone is so busy up here," he said. "People are nice, but I'll be in the grocery store and I'll make eye contact with someone and say: 'How ya doing?' And they'll look away, down at their feet.
"I'm sure they're thinking, 'What's wrong with that guy?' But back home, that's what everybody does."
This group of Giants linebackers inherits a grand heritage, one that dates from Sam Huff and carries forward to Lawrence Taylor. Their reputations are not highly developed, since Giants fans don't simultaneously visualize them and their jersey numbers as they once did Taylor and his No. 56, Harry Carson and his No. 53, Carl Banks and his No. 58.
But Miller as the steadfast strongside linebacker, Widmer as the ferocious, yet cerebral, middle linebacker, Armstead as the freelancing playmaker at weakside linebacker and Galyon as the pass-defending specialist in the team's nickel defense are an underrated group coming of age within an underrated Giants defense.
And they are an overachieving crew, too. Miller and Galyon were each picked in the sixth round of the N.F.L. draft, Widmer in the seventh and Armstead in the eighth. Players drafted that late are not projected to be starters, let alone stars.
Indeed, Widmer was selected as a defensive lineman. Miller was told on draft day by Bill Parcells, the Giants coach at the time, that he would be converted to a tight end. Armstead was asked to move his skills to strong safety as recently as three years ago. Galyon, until two months ago, was thought of primarily as a special teams player.
Armstead, who celebrates his 27th birthday today, has always had the best football pedigree of the bunch. Coming out of Dallas, he was considered the best high school linebacker in the nation. When he got to Miami, he was nicknamed Superman.
"That's until some Kryptonite got me in the knee," Armstead said. During his sophomore season, Armstead had major reconstructive knee surgery. He was never highly rated by pro scouts again. Not just because of his knee, but also because he was listed at 6 feet 1 inch and 220 pounds.
"I've been told I was too small all my life," Armstead said. "Even in high school, they said I was too small. When I got to the pros, they said I didn't have a position. It was enough to give a man an identity crisis."
But Armstead, who can rarely be found without a smile on his face, had an answer. "The Jessie regimen," he said. "Eat, lift, run. Then do it again."
And now, with his weight up to 240 pounds and his speed in the open field still intact, Armstead is terrorizing offenses. He leads the Giants in tackles, just as he led them last season.
Giants coaches continually refer to Armstead's sharp football instincts. "What that means," said the team's linebackers coach, Mike Haluchak, "is he has a sense for where the ball is going to be on the field. And he knows the best angle to get there."
Armstead may have been a natural linebacker, but Widmer, 28, and Miller, who turned 29 yesterday, learned on the job as Giants. Widmer had been a defensive tackle at Montana State, and Miller was a defensive end at South Carolina. But since each is asked to fend off blockers and defend the run in the Giants' current 4-3 base defense, a certain in-the-trenches mentality has been helpful.
"I've always liked smash-mouth football," Widmer said. "But you can't get too crazy. They're going to pass, and then what will you do? You've got to keep your head."
Though an emotional player who can often be seen screaming at opponents and teammates, Widmer has the most placid off-the-field interests. Besides the piano, he flies gliders at home in Montana. "It's a great place to fly because if you encounter any problems, you just land in somebody's backyard," he said.
Widmer also comes from a family of artists and avid players of the real-estate market in his hometown of Bozeman, Mont.
"My mom convinced me to buy my first duplex when I was 20 years old," Widmer said. "Bought it for $35,000, sold it for $95,000. I've since bought five more."
Miller has a physique like Samson and is one of the few players in the Giants' locker room who played on the last Giants playoff team in 1993, but he is one of the least heralded players of the Giants' surprising 1997 season.
"Strongside linebacker is not a position where you make a lot of plays," Haluchak said. "Corey's job is to control the tight end, and sometimes take on linemen and fullbacks. He makes the ball go where we want it to go and then others make the tackles. But he's outstanding at his job."
Miller accepts the grunt work with good humor. "I'll do all the work," he said last week, laughing. "And let the other guys go to the Pro Bowl and sit there sipping mai tais."
Miller is talkative with reporters, which got him in trouble with the staff of the former Giants Coach Dan Reeves. "I have to be myself," he said. "And pro athletes can do a lot of good and influence a lot of people with what they say."
Miller, who grew up in the small town of Pageland, S.C., also speaks often at church groups, telling his story. "I don't sugarcoat it," he said. "I tell them that as a teen-ager I'd go to school drunk. My cousin and I used to break into stores and steal stuff. Just for kicks, we'd head into the better neighborhoods and beat up white kids, get involved in all sorts of racial stuff.
"Thank God for my parents; they instilled a Christian ethic and kept me from going too far over the edge. God took someone like me and turned me around. And now I know that the most important job I have is being a good father. It's hard but rewarding work." Miller and his wife, Lisa, have two sons, C. J. and Christian.
Galyon is in his second year out of the University of Tennessee. In passing situations, he enters the game with an extra defensive back while Widmer and Miller leave.
Fox called Galyon "a pleasant surprise."
Galyon also has a flair for the dramatic. His first N.F.L. tackle was on Emmitt Smith, whom he stopped for no gain on a third-and-1 last season.
Against Detroit last week, Galyon charged into the Lions' backfield on Detroit's first running play and pulled Barry Sanders down for a 4-yard loss.
"I'll tell you what I like about these guys," Fox said. "The characteristics you need to play this game have nothing to do with how you're built or how fast you run on the track. It's a tough game, and you need people of high character. That's what these guys have, and that's what makes them unique."
Well, that's not all that makes them unique. With the writing, the religion, the music and the teaching skills, they would make for entertaining guests at a dinner party.
Just don't invite them over for an enlightening Sunday brunch. It would interfere with their day jobs.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester;
In County's North, a Land Rush for Building Lots

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
THE booming economy, combined with low interest rates and a pent-up demand for new construction, has created a land rush in Westchester, with some areas experiencing strong double-digit increases in sales in the last year.
The activity is concentrated in the northern reaches of the county, where sizable building lots are still available. "In the southern part of the county, they're out of land," said Ebie Wood, a regional manager for Houlihan/Lawrence. "People there are buying existing properties and knocking them down. That doesn't show up as a land sale, but that's essentially what it is." 
 In Pound Ridge, one of Westchester's most rural northern towns, land sales have almost doubled this year. And that number is expected to go higher before the year's end, according to Ms. Wood.
"There have been 22 sales in Pound Ridge so far this year," Ms. Wood said. "And there are two more pending, and four are in negotiation." That is up from 12 sales in all of 1996 and 6 in 1995.
Sales have also jumped, although not so dramatically, across the northeast quadrant of the county. In an area that includes Armonk, Chappaqua, Somers, Bedford, Pound Ridge, Lewisboro and North Salem, there have been 76 sales so far this year, with 23 pending, according to Ms. Wood. Last year, in the same area, there were 73.
Ms. Wood and other brokers say that the people buying land range from wealthy individuals looking for large properties on which to build a single-family home to developers primarily interested in building lots, preferably with all their approvals already in place.
"The big builders are back and they don't want to battle the local people or raise the ire of the community," said Stuart R. Scamberg, a lawyer who represents property owners. He said he had noticed increased activity in the last few years. "There are more applications pending and we spend more time in front of municipal boards, that's for sure," he said.
Mr. Scamberg said he had also noticed some other trends. "For one thing, land around golf courses is extremely hot," he said. "And high-end single building lots, selling for $500,000, are in demand. These are mostly bought by wealthy individuals. There seems to be a great deal of money around."
Of the large builders, the most active in the county is Toll Brothers of Huntingdon Valley, Pa. It entered the county in 1993, has completed five single-family communities and is now building six more. "We continue to see opportunity in Westchester," said Robert Parahus, a vice president. "We're under contract to buy 63 building lots in Cortlandt Manor."
Toll Brothers evaluates each property on "whether or not we can make money with it," Mr. Parahus said, adding, "We need to be able to develop a substantial number of homes to be able to come out with a profit." The average home built by Toll Brothers in Westchester sells for $500,000, Mr. Parahus said.
In general, land prices have come down since the boom years of the late 1980's. "At the height of the market, building lots of an acre or more were selling for $300,000," said Patrick Browne, a broker with Preferred Realty Better Homes and Gardens, in Cross River. "Now builders won't pay more than $100,000 to $150,000 for a lot."
That is because properties are often more strictly zoned now, allowing for less development. "And they are subject to more stringent environmental regulations, especially for land in the New York City watershed," Mr. Browne added.
Last year, Gilbert Johnson, a local builder, purchased six building lots in Pound Ridge, paying approximately $100,000 per two-acre lot. "There were multiple bidders so I had to pay the going rate," Mr. Johnson said.
The property had some of its approvals but not all. "I had to spend an additional $12,000 to get the remaining approvals," Mr. Johnson said, "and another $130,000 improving the land and getting it in shape to build on it."
A lot of the remaining land is difficult to build on, requiring fill, blasting and other costly operations. "The easier land has already been developed," Mr. Johnson said. "Every builder has to factor in additional costs. There's always going to be a Murphy's Law part of the property. You just don't know which one it will be."
Mr. Johnson, who had previous experience buying land in Pound Ridge in the early 1980's, added: "Nobody can expect the appreciation we saw in the late 1980's. You can't flip properties and make money like you could then."
John Ciardullo, a developer, learned this the hard way. He bought 100 acres in Waccabuc in 1985 for $900,000. "A few years later, it was worth $3 million," Mr. Ciardullo said. He didn't sell, however, hoping to develop it, and he wound up spending an additional $3.5 million for legal and consulting fees over a 10-year period completing environmental impact statements.
ALTHOUGH he now has all of his approvals and is preparing the property for 21 homes, Mr. Ciardullo said, "I will never do anything again involving Seqra," referring to the State Environmental Quality Review Act, which places stringent controls on development in watershed areas.
Such economic factors have forced the smaller players out of the market, according to Mr. Scamberg. "After the stock market collapse of 1987, the small players left and most have never returned," he said "Only the big player can afford to remain."
The current building boom is a reflection of the strength of the overall housing market in Westchester, which for the last few years has experienced record sales. "The inventory of resales had to be cleared out before we'd see this amount of interest in land on the part of builders," Mr. Browne said.
It also reflects confidence in the long-term health of the economy. "The low interest rates definitely help," Ms. Wood said. "But building a house is a long-tern project. To do it, you have to believe that the economy is strong long-term."
Certain sociological factors have also played a role, according to Ms. Wood. "The northern part of the county has become more desirable to buyers due to life style changes, which allow more people to work from home," she said. "The commute into midtown Manhattan isn't as wildly important as it once was."

HEADLINE: MARIJUANA AND PRO BASKETBALL -- A special report.;
N.B.A.'s Uncontrolled Substance.

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS

 BODY:
Contrary to the wholesome image marketed by the National Basketball Association, 60 to 70 percent of its 350-plus players smoke marijuana and drink excessively, according to conversations with more than two dozen players, former players, agents and basketball executives.
"If they tested for pot, there would be no league," said Richard Dumas, the former Phoenix Suns guard who was banned from the league for drug and alcohol use and is now playing in Europe. "Weed is something guys grow up doing, and there's no reason for them to stop. Because almost everyone does it, no one wants to test for it. They're afraid to." 
 Two decades ago, the league nearly collapsed under a perception that its athletes were high on cocaine. Now, many people are saying the N.B.A.'s 14-year-old drug policy is so antiquated and ineffective that it protects players despite behavior that is illegal and commonplace. Under the collective bargaining agreement, the league, which begins its new season in five days, allows mandatory drug testing of rookies only, does not list marijuana as a prohibited substance, and prevents teams from testing veterans for cocaine and heroin except under rare circumstances.
"The policy is ridiculous," said Karl Malone, Utah's All-Star forward and last year's most valuable player. "Marijuana is not tested for, and yet that is the big thing guys are getting in trouble with in the league. It's terrible. What you're saying to the young kids playing in college is this: Smoke all the pot you want to, because it won't be detected until you are picked up by the cops and it's all over the newspapers."
Malone could have been talking about any of three players who were involved in marijuana cases over the summer: Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, Portland's Isaiah Rider and Toronto's Marcus Camby. A possession charge against Iverson was dropped in a plea bargain, Rider pleaded no contest on a possession charge stemming from the previous summer, and Camby agreed to do community service to avoid prosecution on a possession charge. The publicity has tarnished the polished product that Commissioner David Stern has pushed into living rooms around the globe.
According to many of the players interviewed, when the games end, the night is just beginning. Marijuana, drinking and clubs are part of a post-game party scene in almost every N.B.A. city. Cocaine, once the bane of pro basketball, has fallen out of favor, but a fast-paced life style has been thriving in a league that is increasingly richer and younger. More exotic drugs are available, including MDMA, an amphetamine also known as ecstasy or the love drug because it supposedly enhances sex.
Six years ago, the sport was stunned with the revelation that Magic Johnson had tested positive for H.I.V., prompting a graphic and painful discussion of sexual promiscuity. Now, the case of Marv Albert, the league's respected voice on network television, is only the latest evidence that the party life style associated with the game is spinning out of control. Aside from problems with marijuana, N.B.A. players have been written up in police reports on almost 20 occasions in the last year for accusations ranging from driving under the influence of alcohol to domestic violence.
Although there are no formal statistics on marijuana use in the N.B.A., many people interviewed placed the figure between 60 and 70 percent of players. One agent suggested the number was even higher.
"No one can really know, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was close to 70 percent," said Robert Pack, the Dallas point guard. "I haven't seen 70 percent of guys do it, but everyone knows guys who do. I think most of the ones who do smoke marijuana try to keep it hidden."
"You don't follow guys home, but just from what you hear, I think it's closer to 70 percent," said Derek Harper, the Orlando Magic point guard. "It's scary, because you don't know when guys are using it. You don't know if guys are under the influence while they're playing or what the case is."
Stern admitted in a recent interview that he has "serious questions concerning drinking and marijuana," and that perhaps too much attention was paid to economic issues in the last collective bargaining agreement, signed more than a year ago. If the owners decide to reopen the agreement in July, the league will propose tightening the drug policy, Stern said, by suggesting some degree of private testing that might allow the union to supervise it, and that would include marijuana. But the National Basketball Players Association has historically resisted mandatory testing and budged only a little in 1988 by agreeing to rookie testing.
"I think the union has a balancing act," Stern said. "I think anyone representing someone is fair in saying, 'Don't discriminate by asking us to take oaths and allegiances that you don't place on other people.' Saying, 'Are or have you been a member of the pot-smoking party,' is a series of words that raises a sense of witch hunting.
"But on the other hand, we do have a group of people, including players, who collectively work hard and obey the law. You have to ask yourself what additional obligations come to people in those positions. I think we and the union sort of disagree as to where you draw the line."
 
League Image Vs. Star Power
Will either side compromise? If there is enough solidarity among players who do not want an updated policy, how does a league, bankrolled by its stars, reel in the freedom it has given them in past negotiations?
"I've often heard it from players that they suspect people in management are using drugs," said Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players association. If tougher drug testing were applied to all league employees, other workers would resist just like the players, he said.
"If there is a marijuana problem, it's one reflective of society," Hunter said. "The conflict comes in because you have states around the country that are looking to legalize it. We intend to take a reasonable and prudent stance on this issue. We have a concern about player image and the success of the league. We don't want to undermine it or destroy it. But I don't intend to impose on our players more than what is imposed on people in society."
But do N.B.A. players mirror society? The average player's salary is $2.2 million, affording a life of stardom, wealth and power that can lead to a feeling of invincibility. Some players have appeared out of control, and alcohol has been a problem.
"Alcohol is a much larger problem than marijuana or the designer drugs," said the Knicks' Buck Williams, who was union president during the last collective bargaining negotiations.
Said Dennis Scott, who was traded to Dallas from Orlando during the summer: "After a game, especially if a guy has had a bad night, I've seen players drink until they pass out in their chair. If they're lucky, someone is watching their back, ready to haul them back to their hotel room."
One theory to explain widespread alcohol abuse is the increasing number of players who leave college early or bypass college to join the league without any real experience in adult society. Others believe drinking problems are associated with the pressure of trying to be a star.
In any event, players are vulnerable to the post-game party scene that frequently takes place in the clubs.
"If you do go out, the temptation will be there," Pack said. "The party atmosphere is a real lure. People you don't know want to be your best friend. It's about making the right decisions. If you expose yourself to the clubs, temptation is there waiting for you."
 
Few Offenders Are Caught
 Dumas, who was suspended after testing positive for cocaine as a rookie in 1991, was tossed out again in 1995 because he violated a clause in his contract that prohibited him from consuming alcohol.
"It's a life style that's very, very fast, and some guys don't have a grip on it," he said. "You go out to a club and you start drinking. And then some guy says, 'Hey try this.' You might be so drunk, you'll say yes."
Chances are, you will not be caught. Dumas and Roy Tarpley are the only players in the 1990's to have been barred from the league under the current policy -- which means either the league is a model in creating a drug-free zone or usage is going undetected.
Under the drug policy, teams have little opportunity to find out whether a veteran player, who might represent a huge salary investment, is using drugs. Suspicious behavior by a player -- missing flights, acting erratically, arriving at a game sleep-deprived and glassy-eyed -- is not enough reason to test him. There has to be definitive proof of drug use, such as a witness who is willing to come forward by name. Any evidence has to be presented to an arbitrator, who decides whether there should be a test.
"In all of the years I've been a general manager -- 11 years since 1986 -- I have never had a player tested," said John Nash, the Nets' General Manager. "Not that I didn't have suspicions. But I didn't have enough evidence to test a player."
This is by design, said the players association's Hunter, who is not willing to bend on this issue.
"You could have a problem player on your team, and all of the sudden he becomes a player who is under suspicion," Hunter said. "If you take action based on that suspicion, with nothing to substantiate it, it's not constitutional. I would never agree to anything like that. It's too ripe for abuse. It gives management a stick to abuse players who may not have a drug problem. They could use that as subterfuge to get to the guy because of other conduct. Testing based on suspicion is a way to control or monitor players they don't like."
The N.B.A. is a player's league, built on the marketability of the individual. Games are billed as Patrick Ewing versus Shaquille O'Neal. And this kind of star power, some people contend, is the reason mandatory drug-testing will never come to pass.
"I think it's like, be careful who you test because it might show up in some guys you don't want it to show up in," Malone said. "If I were smoking marijuana and I was tested, there should be a penalty.
"I think, if nothing else, fans have a right to know if a player is on drugs because they are paying to see them perform to the best of their ability. You should know if a player has a drug problem, but you have no way of knowing because that is unconstitutional? Give me a break. To me, if you don't want to be held to a standard, don't come into this league. If you don't want to be tested, what are you afraid of?"
Testing could also help some players who might not be able to recognize a dangerous health condition. Who knows whether Reggie Lewis of the Boston Celtics would be alive today if the league had a screening process? In July 1993, his death was officially attributed to heart damage caused by a virus. But a Wall Street Journal report in 1995 contended that Lewis had signs of heart damage consistent with cocaine use. League officials disputed the report, which undermined the perception that the N.B.A. had eradicated cocaine use by its players.
"It's not as widespread as marijuana, but cocaine is still there," Dumas said. "It's something guys have learned to keep very quiet and very low-key."
Cocaine became an N.B.A. problem after a series of arrests in the late 1970's and early 80's. That unsavory image led the union leaders Quinn Buckner, Bob Lanier and Junior Bridgeman, in concert with the league, to implement what was then considered the toughest drug policy in sports. Beginning in 1984, the policy called for an immediate ban of any player convicted of, or pleading guilty to, a crime involving cocaine or heroin. That rule still applies.
A player who believes he has a problem can come forward and receive treatment. A second request for help carries a suspension with pay, and a third leads to a suspension without pay. In the infancy of the policy, Lewis Lloyd, Mitchell Wiggins, Micheal Ray Richardson and Duane Washington were barred for cocaine use. By 1988, cocaine seemed like a designer drug that had fallen out of style.
 
Running Afoul Of the Law
 Fair or not, one name inevitably surfaces as an example of players behaving badly: Allen Iverson. On the night of Aug. 3, Iverson and two friends were pulled over by the police for traveling 93 m.p.h. on Interstate 64 in Virginia. The state trooper smelled marijuana, and soon discovered a .45-caliber pistol on the floor mat, along with marijuana cigarettes. Iverson and his friends were arrested. Iverson said the gun was his, and on Oct. 6, he pleaded no contest to a charge of carrying a concealed weapon. The marijuana charge was dropped, but as part of the plea bargain, he must undergo monthly drug testing for two years.
The league is attempting to hold players responsible for their legal behavior. This past month Stern handed down a one-game suspension for Iverson, and at the same time assessed a two-game suspension for Rider, as a way of saying enough is enough.The commissioner did not base his sanctions on the drug policy but on his power to discipline players for conduct detrimental to the league.
The subject of marijuana was raised in the last round of collective bargaining, part of an unsuccessful effort by the league to update the drug policy.
"They didn't have any substantial evidence to base a more complete program on," Buck Williams said. "We didn't want the N.B.A. to go on a witch hunt."
Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said the league is not seeking a strictly punitive solution and is willing to expose people who work for the league to the same testing as players. "We were assured by the union that they would work to come up with a more up-to-date, comprehensive policy," Granik said. "They basically have refused to make any amendments."
And why shouldn't they refuse?
"As far as use, it's bad in the league, but I think half of America might smoke marijuana, whether you want to believe that or not," said Toronto guard Damon Stoudamire. "So I think to single out players, because of a couple of players who had incidents -- no, I don't think that's the way to go."
Other people counter that widespread marijuana use is just another symptom of a troubled league, where some players continue to push the limits of what is legal in a party-till-you-drop routine.
"As long as you perform," Dumas said, "no one is going to ask questions."
Stern disputes that notion and said the league is concerned about the physical effects of marijuana.
"There is the issue of muscle deterioration that could come with the retention of substances like marijuana in the body, and concerns about the recovery time of injuries that might be lengthened by marijuana," Stern said. "I'm not saying it's a problem. But it's an issue that we'd like to address. Beyond that, there is an opportunity for athletes to lead as examples."
A player getting high and drunk in a strip club or a hotel room is not the image the league wants drifting into the public eye.
"Playing in this league carries with it a responsibility," Malone said. "I worry about the image of this league all the time. I want to leave this league in as good or better shape than when I came. If every other guy took that approach, it would be better than picking up a paycheck and saying, 'I'm going to do what I want to because of who I am.'
"We talk about the N.B.A. not doing enough, but the responsibility has to fall on each individual. Still, everyone has to police it, from the league office to the union. You have to have cops in society. You hope you don't ever have to use them, but you have too many knuckleheads out there, too many guys doing crazy things without realizing the consequences."

HEADLINE: Children's Museum Finds Support

BYLINE: By MARY CUMMINGS 

 BODY:
THE Children's Museum of the East End does not have a space of its own. But if the seven women who thought up the idea in April 1996 and organized a pilot exhibition that opens today at Guild Hall in East Hampton have their way, it will.
"It has really been an exciting project," the principal designer of the show, Jo Ann Secor, said about the effort to establish a home. "And a whirlwind." 
 Ms. Secor, director of museum services for Lee H. Skolnick Architecture + Design in Manhattan, said that she and her husband, Lee Skolnick, the architect, had been pressed into service shortly after the director of Guild Hall, Henry Korn, had offered space to the fledgling institution and invited the committee to try out the museum idea with an exhibition that would run simultaneously with "The Moran Family Legacy" from today to Jan 11. With the East Hampton Library as co-sponsor, the exhibition features paintings by Thomas Moran, whose family was at the center of East Hampton cultural life at the turn of the century.
Ms. Secor said that Mr. Korn, who knew of the firm's work for children's museums elsewhere, introduced the couple to the committee, starting the process that led to the show, "Time and Place/Light and Space."
Mr. Skolnick and Ms. Secor, who have two school-age children, were eager to help despite a schedule that includes work for children's museums in Alabama, Florida and West Virginia.
With a house in North Haven, Ms. Secor and Mr. Skolnick were in a position to understand the committee of seven mothers of young children who live year-round in the Hamptons.
A statement by the committee said that families on the East End could feel isolated and that for all its natural beauty and rich heritage, the area lacks an inviting place for children to explore the wonders around them.
The members -- Beatrice Alda, Janet Jennings, Jorie Latham, Jaqui Leader, Jacqui Leader, Bridget LeRoy, Lucie Muhlfeld and Kari Lyn Sabin -- agreed at an initial meeting to create "a safe and fun place where young children and adults can learn together through interactive exhibits and activities."
After the group sought volunteers, Ms. Secor said, a result was an "almost 100 percent" volunteer effort, including work by carpenters andartists, as well as materials donated by merchants.
In the Hamptons, where social divisions are skewed by the presence of a super-rich summer colony and distrust can run deep between locals and newcomers, year-round residents and weekenders, suppliers of services and those they serve, the broad-based support that the committee has enlisted attests to the determination and social skills of its members.
"The committee is extraordinary," Ms. Secor said. "It's made up of very talented people. It's one thing to have the enthusiasm, another to actually apply it, put the vision down on paper and develop the program."
The committee members have a tradition of civic activity. Ms. Alda, daughter of Alan Alda, is project director. She is a trustee for a foundation that aids children at risk of problems.
Ms. Jennings, a painter, has worked with children in arts programs. Ms. Latham is a performer in schools, and Ms. Leader runs a children's theater workshop and directs the East End Special Players, a theatrical troupe with retarded people.
Ms. LeRoy is a writer and a co-founder of The East Hampton Independent and a sister paper in Southampton. Ms. Muhlfeld, a freelance fund-raiser, has taught dance, and Ms. Sabin has been a partner with her husband, Andrew, in the South Fork Natural History Society.
Using Moran, his family and the East Hampton artists' colony as a springboard, Ms. Secor said, the designers devised ideas to incorporatethe images and themes from that exhibition in their exploration of the East End in Moran's time and now.
One Moran landscape, "A Midsummer Day, East Hampton, Long Island," from 1903), was enlarged for "Time and Place." Behind "discovery doors" are sections of text on in East Hampton around 1903. A child who opens a cutout for the cow, for example, will learn, "Every house had a cow."
In accordance with current ideas on encouraging children to think creatively, the exhibit seeks to be interactive, hands-on and multimedia. Children will fish in a make-believe pond with magnetized rods. As they "shop" at a farm stand they will pick up pointers on plants, economics and the advantages of a shopping list. And when they dig into the costume bin to dress up in 19th-century clothing, Ms. Secor said, they will find out that "people were quite decorated 100 years ago, as opposed to today."
"It's a temporary installation," Ms. Secor said. "But we did design it so the entire thing could be packed up and stored for reinstallation at another time."

HEADLINE: Who Can Afford Him?;
Stephen King Goes in Search of a New Publisher

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
The horror. The horror. Superstar storyteller and scaremeister Stephen King is abandoning Viking, his publisher of 18 years, fleeing what seemed like a contented and placid literary relationship that spanned 44 titles from "The Dead Zone" to "Desperation."
With a strange mixture of anticipation and cold dread, a few major publishers are considering Mr. King, like classmates warily circling Carrie at the high school prom. They are pondering whether to pounce on his newly completed manuscript, "Bag of Bones," a 1,000-page novel about an author who develops writer's block after the death of his wife. 
 In fact, a handful of top New York-based publishing houses are rushing to put proposals together to land Mr. King. But many executives in the running say privately that the rare contest for a superstar author will be a test of the industry's resolve to rein in astronomical advances in a particularly bleak sales climate.
"This is really a reality check for all those people who have been saying that the business is out of control and the advances are going through the roof," said one top publishing executive participating in discussions. "We'll see how many people are going to go out there and pay a ridiculous amount of money."
By most reports, the new tome is vintage King, a gripping tale from an author so beloved that a recent trade industry survey indicated that readers would like to be marooned on a desert island with their first choice of a Bible or their second choice of a King horror novel.
But several publishing executives involved in the talks fear that even another best seller from Mr. King will almost certainly lose money in a conventional publishing deal given the asking price of more than $17 million for a "Bag of Bones."
"It's pretty impossible to make money at that level," said Paul Fedorko, the publisher at William Morrow, which is trying to piece together a proposal that would include deals with other divisions of Morrow's parent, the Hearst Corporation. "But if you can put something else together then it's worthwhile to be in business with Stephen King."
Publishers are also weighing whether the sizable advance is better spent by spreading such a sum among up-and-coming authors rather than using it for a brand name whose net sales appear to have leveled at just over a million. At times, the rhetoric coming from New York publishing houses has the distinct ring of a major league franchise owner mulling whether to put a top athlete on waivers.
"Do you want to have one superstar with a lot of utility infielders around him or do you want to have nine All Stars on the field?" said a top publisher who considered making a bid. "We're fed up. I just feel that we're doing all this work for a poor bottom line.
"I realize that life isn't fair, but it ought to be tolerable," the publisher continued. "I have no problem with building up a superstar author where everybody makes money. But to be forced to pay top dollar so you basically can make no money?"
Mr. King's work has been a staple on best-seller lists since "The Dead Zone" was published in 1979. But even best-sellerhood is a relative concept: 20 of the author's books have made The New York Times best-seller list, for instance -- but newer books tend to spend less time there.
Mr. King became a literary free agent earlier this month after negotiations for a new book deal reached an impasse with Viking, where he had long been considered the undisputed pillar of the publishing house, both under his own name and his pen name, Richard Bachman.
But recently, Mr. King was forced to share the rarefied air of superstar status after Viking's corporate parent, the British media conglomerate Pearson P.L.C., acquired the Putnam Berkley Group early this year and created Penguin Putnam Inc. That brought into the same luxury stable the author Tom Clancy, whose sales record far outstripped Mr. King's. In 1996, according to Publishers Weekly, Mr. Clancy sold more than 2.4 million copies of "Executive Orders" while Mr. King sold 1.5 million of his books.
In the top echelon of the publishing industry, the conventional wisdom is that Mr. King was bolting Penguin Putnam because he was irked that Mr. Clancy negotiated a more lucrative deal. In August, Penguin Putnam announced a complex new deal with Mr. Clancy that includes a partnership to develop on-line games and the publication of two novels.
Penguin Putnam officials declined to reveal the total cost, but publishing executives estimate that Mr. Clancy could earn more than $20 million for each book, which does not include money spent on the on-line ventures, bringing the estimated total of the deal to nearly $100 million. In his last deal with Penguin, Mr. King earned almost $16 million for each book based on a four-book sale for $63.5 million.
The bottom line for Penguin Putnam is apparently the view that Mr. Clancy sells so many books that he will earn a profit even with a sizable advance.
Mr. King, who lives in Maine, was unavailable for comment. His lawyer and agent of 10 years, Arthur B. Greene, said the author was traveling in Australia.
Mr. Greene said that Mr. King decided to sever ties with Penguin Putnam after reaching an "impasse," which he declined to describe. "There were aspects that he wasn't satisfied with. He became a bit stale," Mr. Greene said, adding that he was referring to the author's treatment and growth.
Mr. Greene said he had "no idea" how much Tom Clancy made on his contract with Penguin Putnam and that Mr. King was simply searching for a "new enduring relationship." Mr. Greene also declined to elaborate in detail about what Mr. King is hunting for, but he said, "it's the publishing strategy principally and, of course, financial considerations."
Mr. King's spurned publisher, Penguin Putnam, is saying little publicly while keenly watching the actions of its rivals. Although Mr. Greene said that Mr. King's relationship with Penguin Putnam is over, Marilyn Ducksworth, a senior vice president for the company, said gamely that, "as far as we're concerned we are still in negotiations."
But despite that belief, several publishing companies started receiving query letters from Mr. King's attorney last week when many of their top executives were away at the Frankfurt Book Fair.
"After being published for more than 20 years by one company, Stephen King has decided to make a change," the letter stated. "We're contacting a small group of publishers and are indicating to them that Mr. King is looking to establish another longstanding relationship, which will be artistically and financially beneficial to all parties."
The news was so surprising that one publisher thought it was a joke.
"Here's a guy who has been a success," said Mr. Fedorko, the publisher at Morrow. "What happened? What is going on here? Is this a scam of some sort? Frankly, I thought it was a friend kidding me."
The query letter from Mr. King's attorney set a Wednesday deadline for submission of proposals, but that deadline was eventually extended and several publishers met with the lawyer late last week.
The letter did not specify the asking price for "Bag of Bones," but in meetings it became clear to participants that the focus of Mr. King's search for a new publisher was not a literary issue, but simply business -- with an asking price of more than $17 million.
Mr. King was not present at any of the meetings, a fact that some publishers found troubling because typically authors participate in significant negotiations. Several said that Mr. King's lawyer listened sympathetically to their concerns that it would be difficult to make money on Mr. King at his present sales levels. But they were told that the author expected a new publisher to make greater efforts than Viking to increase sales.
"There was an air of unreality to the meeting," said one publisher, who said he left feeling like the imprisoned character in the Stephen King book "Misery," which was made into a film in 1990 about a writer tortured by a psychotic outraged over a plot twist.
And so that leaves publishers playing out the standard tension scenes of any horror movie as they warily pass each other in Manhattan restaurants. Will a competitor take the plunge and pay Mr. King an enormous advance?
"What's interesting about this is to see whether all this talk about a recession in the book business has had some impact," said one of the players.
"All it takes," he added, "is one."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Technology Stocks Hit By Variety Of Problems

BYLINE: BY DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Technology stocks, the perennial leaders of the current bull market, are under fire.
Since mid-April, when the stock market began surging out of a sharp decline, technology issues had been leaders of the pack, helping lift the broader market to record after record high. 
 But for the last two weeks, the share prices of technology companies have been plunging on everything from fears that earnings growth could be decelerating at home to worries about economic turmoil abroad.
The strength of technology -- now considered a bellwether sector -- is critical because the market is at an impasse. Yet several analysts interviewed over the weekend suggested that mounting problems in the once high-flying technology sector could spell further trouble for a market already seething with anxiety.
Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose as high as 8,060.44 on Tuesday, before plummeting 345.03 points, or 4.3 percent, over the next three days. The fall was triggered by a currency crisis that began in Thailand earlier in the year, but quickly spread across Southeast Asia and into Hong Kong, where stock prices plunged 18 percent in the week.
And with an Asian financial crisis threatening to further disrupt world markets this week, some analysts are nervous that a weakening technology sector might precipitate a steep fall in the broad market here.
"The reality is the market has placed a great burden on technology companies to perform above the bar because prices have been bid up so high," said Charles Federman, chairman of Broadview Associates, a technology banker in Fort Lee, N.J. "The companies are fundamentally sound, but their growth rates can't keep up with their stock prices. So I think we're going to see a raft of earnings disappointments."
To be sure, many analysts say that third quarter earnings growth in the sector has been robust, and the fundamentals of many of technology companies remain sound.
Yet slowly but surely, questions are arising. Is the technology industry headed for a slump? Personal computer sales growth appears to be slowing, and overcapacity in the industry has led to a sharp drop in the prices of computers and memory chips. In fact, an entire legion of big name companies -- from Intel to Silicon Graphics -- have issued warnings about slowing earnings prospects.
"The deterioration has been coming for a long time," said Fred Hickey, an independent analyst who publishes The High-Tech Strategist, a newsletter. "The investors are finally beginning to connect the dots."
Among Mr. Hickey's concerns are price pressures, declining growth rates and the rapidly souring prospects of doing business in Asia, which many companies had looked to as a potential growth vehicle.
These concerns helped undermine a rally early Friday, as the United States stock markets attempted to follow the lead of European and Hong Kong exchanges, which had rebounded earlier that day from a steep fall on Thursday.
When the wreckage was overturned, technology issues had taken a beating, partly because Intel said it would postpone opening a $1.3 billion plant because of weakening demand for its computer chips.
"Intel is one of the bellwethers of technology, so when investors see that kind of change, they get concerned," said Gus Richard, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco. "Semiconductor companies tend to move in herds. If one starts spending, they all start spending; and if one stops spending they all stop."
Mr. Richard said that although the downturn in Asia is not a direct threat to the broad technology sector, semiconductor capital equipment makers would be hurt by turmoil in the Pacific Rim, which accounts for about 40 percent of their business. If Asian companies in the computer chip pipeline suffer, demand for American products could also suffer.
As a result, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index -- one of this year's best performers -- plunged 5.2 percent on Friday, and is down 16.7 percent in a month. A broader technology measure, the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index, also took a beating, dropping 2.5 percent.
Technology stocks tend to be volatile, largely because their high share prices, analysts said. And so if earnings disappoint, or sentiment shifts, those stocks get hammered.
Also, the same kind of momentum investing that helped push the value of the technology sector up to $1.5 trillion -- or 13 percent of the US stock market -- can just as quickly reverse course when the news turns sour.
One question is: just how strong are the companies. While some analysts, like Roger McNamee at Integral Capital Partners in San Francisco, argue that technology companies are resilient and that the recent selloff creates "a massive buying opportunity," others aren't too sure.
"There are manic bulls out there," Mr. Hickey said. "If there is one company doing well, they'll say everything's fine. The fact is: when you have p/e's in the 50's, you can't have decelerating growth rates."
Indeed, Mr. Hickey and others believe the industry's wounds are being masked by the performances of a handful of high-profile companies, such as Dell and Microsoft. Many other computer companies, from Acer to Gateway, are facing weakening prospects, they say, partly because of the introduction of more inexpensive personal computers.
But Charles Hill, director of research at First Call Inc., which tracks earnings reports, suggests that the threat of technology, one of the pillars of this bull market, tumbling over is a little premature.
Third-quarter earnings are up an average of 14 percent for the bigger companies, thus far, and smaller companies are up even more. The problem is: many of these firms are not keeping pace with expectations.
"The difference for technology this time is we're only meeting expectations, while we were beating them in the first and second quarter," he said.

HEADLINE: Station Weighs Local Appeal Against Ready-Made Programs

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SHAPLEY 

DATELINE: READING, Pa.

 BODY:
Maybe it is the barking of the ownerless dogs penned in the county humane society across the street. Maybe it is the lingering scare from the explosion at the neighboring gas processing plant, which sent a brick through the station manager's window.
There are plenty of reasons why the staff of Reading Broadcasting Inc. has been tense behind the tidy white facade of WTVE-TV Channel 51 on North 11th Street. The station, like many of the nation's small, independent commercial broadcasters, has become an economically endangered species, thanks in part to the 1996 Telecommunications Act. 
 WTVE must attract more viewers or face stagnation.
For the small UHF station, time is literally money. Air time is its currency. Its owners are constantly preoccupied with the question of how much of this time they must sell to the producers of canned programming and how much of it they can afford to keep for locally produced or otherwise distinctive fare that has special attraction in their area.
The former brings in steady revenue at little cost but also offers little growth potential. The latter is the key to growth -- but, without the access to deep pockets that chain ownership gives to their rivals, WTVE's owners can ill afford to spend too much of the station's air time on these offerings.
The results of this weekly balancing act can be read in the station's weekly program guide.
Until last year, WTVE broadcast HSN Inc.'s Home Shopping Network for 22 hours a day. But, said Peter Bowman of BIA Media Inc., a consulting firm in Chantilly, Va., "Historically, the key to broadcast success has been localism."
So WTVE's owners decided to change the mix. Now about 75 percent of the station's 168-hour weekly broadcast time is sold to distributors of canned programming and infomercials. The station obtains some vintage situation comedies like "The Adventures of Dobie Gillis" for free in exchange for commercial time.
On a recent Sunday, for instance, Reading viewers who clicked away from network affiliates in Harrisburg (50 miles west) and Philadelphia (40 miles southeast) could start the day with WTVE's "Bethany Hour" and "Love of God," then watch "Woods and Wetlands" and "North American Fish and Game."
After that, the station's 1,200-kilowatt tower atop nearby Mount Penn sent out seven hours of marketing pitches for such items as exercise equipment or spray to cover bald spots, followed by two hours of "My Mom's a Werewolf." At 6 P.M., it was time for Sunday's single local show, "La Tarde Alegre."
The sale of 120 hours of air time a week to program distributors brings the station three-quarters of its annual revenue of more than $1 million.
The buyers are Master Media Enterprises Inc. of Fort Mill, S.C., which distributes the Sunday religious fare; Baer Media of Southaven, Miss., which distributes the outdoors programs, and the Paxson Communications Corporation, which delivers WTVE's viewers 15 hours of infomercials a day, and, finally, purveyors of local infomercials.
With that revenue, the station pays the salaries of its 30-person staff (30 percent of its overhead), its electric bill (15 percent of its expenses) and the remaining payments under an arrangement that brought it out of bankruptcy in 1985.
For Mike Parker, the station's de facto owner, who wants to build the station's identity as an appealing local broadcaster in touch with its community, the high point of the Sunday schedule comes with "La Tarde Alegre," a one-hour Hispanic community affairs show produced in WTVE's studio by a Hispanic businessman who also finds advertisers for the show.
At other times during the week, the station broadcasts videotaped events like the Saturday games of the Hershey Bears ice hockey team, with ad time sold to local merchants like the owners of Jack O'Reilly's Tuxedos. Other locally produced shows include "Healthbeat" and "Elderly Update."
"These get us away from the image of just being watched by people by the telephone with their credit cards," said the station's program manager, Dan Bendetti, who is also its local advertising salesman.
Mr. Parker said he thought local programming would set WTVE apart from its larger rivals. And, thanks to a Supreme Court decision last March requiring that cable companies carry most local broadcasters' signals, WTVE's signal now reaches more than a million households, he said.
Mr. Parker obtained 25 percent of the station in 1993 when it emerged from bankruptcy and now has a 33 percent stake. A turnaround specialist, Mr. Parker recently sold WHRC-TV Channel 46 in Boston to Paxson.
The 1996 Telecommunications Act set off a wave of broadcast mergers and buyouts by lifting the limit on the number of stations a single entity can own. Now an owner may have any number of properties so long as its total national audience does not exceed 35 percent. Radio and television acquisitions reached a record $25.4 billion last year.
But despite Congress's stated intention -- to unleash market forces and increase the diversity of voices the public hears -- the number of television station owners has declined. "The independent commercial station will go the way of the corner store when Wal-Mart moves to town," Mr. Bowman said.
"There are 76 fewer TV broadcasters today than just before the Telecom Act was enacted," Mr. Bowman added. The number of owners dropped by 16 percent between January 1996 and mid-October of this year, to 395. The exit of smaller, poorer stations may be inevitable, he said. But, he added, "The merger wave increases the stratification of have-not stations at the bottom."
Some stations in Harrisburg, at the western edge of WTVE's broadcast signal, have benefited from the trend. This city's 584,000 households constituted little more than a television backwater until 1995, when a unit of Clear Channel Communications Inc. paid $30 million for a Harrisburg UHF station. The Allbritton Communications Company, a subsidiary of the privately owned Perpetual Corporation, paid $113 million for another in 1996. The Tribune Broadcasting Company, the nation's fourth-largest chain, bought a UHF station in nearby York.
That has not yet happened in Reading.
But, even while fighting a challenge to the station's license by the Adams Communications Corporation of Chicago, WTVE's owners are planning to pay $1.5 million for a new signal tower that could reach tens of thousands more households in the Philadelphia area.
With a unique identity and more potential viewers, Mr. Parker wants to be one of the first local stations to broadcast digital signals.
Then would he sell to a chain?
"I have a responsibility to my shareholders to maximize market value," Mr. Parker said. "But the same economics that apply to a sale apply to operating a good station. As the revenue goes up, the quality of local programming can go up, and the more valuable the asset is."

Deficit Falls to $22.6 Billion As Tax Revenues Surge
President Clinton will announce today that the Federal budget deficit for the just-completed fiscal year fell to $22.6 billion, its lowest level in decades, largely as a result of strong economic growth that has created a surge in Federal tax revenues. The Administration started the year expecting a deficit of $128 billion. 
 With the nation's fiscal condition improving so rapidly, Republicans in Congress are already talking openly about the deficit being wiped out, and are debating how best to spend any surpluses. Page A1.

HEADLINE: An Indefensible Treaty

BYLINE: By Jack Kemp; Jack Kemp is a co-chairman of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution and a co-director of Empower America.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Imagine a nuclear arms reduction treaty in which three nuclear powers -- say, Russia, France and China -- committed to no specific reductions while other nations disarmed. It seems absurd.
Now imagine negotiating a global climate change treaty to reduce carbon emissions, but with no specific commitments from 3 of the 10 biggest carbon producers, and without even a clear global target. It seems equally absurd. 
 Clearly this is the view of the Senate, which in late July passed a resolution by a 95 to 0 vote stating that the United States should not sign any climate change agreement unless it "mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse emissions for developing countries and would not result in serious harm to the economy."
Frankly, even if these conditions are met, the President should sign no treaty. Whether humans are influencing the climate is unknown. Despite the mantra from the Clinton Administration that the science is settled, it is not. The May issue of Science magazine made this clear. So too did the Heidelberg Appeal, a petition signed by hundreds of distinguished scientists urging against precipitous action.
Bert Bolin, who directed the United Nations scientific report on the issue, disagrees with President Clinton's and Vice President Gore's belief that climate change is causing more violent and unpredictable weather. This year, even the Sierra Club's conservation director, Bruce Hamilton, admitted, "If you look at the science, it's all over the board."
But even if you buy the premise behind global warming, this treaty is indefensible. A "global" warming treaty is no such thing if it omits developing nations where most growth in emissions will take place. This includes China, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and other developing nations, which are expected to produce 60 percent of global carbon emissions in the next few decades. In fact, China is expected to become the biggest carbon producer on the planet.
By failing to include developing nations, we are working against the very purpose of a treaty intended to address the worrisome potential problems of global warming.
Yet the Clinton Administration seems to be pursuing just such an agreement in the negotiations leading up to December's international global climate change meeting in Kyoto, Japan.
In his recent speech outlining his position, the President said the "United States will not assume binding obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully participate in this effort." But what does "key" mean? Does the President intend to sign a treaty that does not include other nations, say, China, Brazil or Mexico? If so, he should say so.
Moreover, with the December treaty deadline fast approaching, our Government has not conducted its own thorough analyses of the treaty's impact on the American economy nor has it embraced any of the many macroeconomic studies already produced.
How can such far-reaching policy be negotiated without a thorough examination of the treaty's effects on the economy, American workers and communities? How can we find solutions that protect workers and communities without first identifying specific global goals? How can we protect ourselves from economic upheaval without honest public analysis of the economic impact associated with the lower carbon emission plan that would be imposed? We have hard work to do before we make hasty agreements.
As Bill Cunningham, a spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., noted in a statement delivered last March:
"Let there be no mistake, whatever happens with respect to greenhouse, it will be working people who finally pay most of the cost. Whatever taxes governments raise, whatever regulation they impose, whatever measures business introduces -- it will be working people who finally must implement the changes and pay much of the cost."
Taking time to act intelligently will serve us all better than trying to live with a flawed agreement.

HEADLINE: Smart Rules for Health Plans

 BODY:
The "bill of rights" for patients that was tentatively approved last week by a Presidential commission would, if adopted by Congress, build in sensible consumer protections without strangling health plans with innovation-killing rules. There are important holes in the commission's work, but on the whole its draft is promising.
The rise of managed care has brought innovative coverage and a surprisingly swift deceleration of health care inflation. But managed care imposes obstacles to choosing doctors and treatments and can reward plans that skimp on care. The insecurity surrounding managed care has triggered calls for Government action, and Congress is inundated with ill-conceived bills that would dictate how health plans treat patients. President Clinton deftly cut off the rush to legislate by appointing the commission, which will reconvene in November to adopt a final report. 
 The draft requires disclosure of key information -- such as the number of times surgeons have performed specific operations and their outcomes -- so that consumers can judge which plans are best. The draft also guarantees consumers the right to appeal to an external authority their plan's decision to deny care for a treatment that the patient believes was covered by the plan's contract. The commission's focus is exactly right. Patients can feel secure about their health plan only if they have enough information and a right to appeal denials of promised benefits.
The commission's report is also interesting for what it does not say. On the positive side, it does not delve into specific mandates, like restrictions on the right to hire and fire doctors, that would raise costs and crimp flexibility. Anything that raises medical costs leads employers -- which cover most non-elderly Americans -- to drop health coverage entirely. On the negative side, the plan does not say how to implement any of its recommendations.
The plan also sidesteps the crucial component of a consumer-friendly health care system: choice. The best way to achieve choice is to require that employers give employees a choice of health plans. Only when consumers can drop one plan for another will their needs drive what health plans do, rather than the other way around. The commission need not fear that employers will drop coverage when faced with a mandate to offer choices. In fact, the evidence is clear that employers save money on premiums when they set up competition among employee health plans.
Of course the biggest hole in the commission's plan is not of its doing. Nothing in a bill of rights can cover 40 million uninsured Americans.

HEADLINE: Carl Feiss, a Pioneer of Urban Preservation, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Carl Feiss, a visionary architect and pioneering urban planner who helped transform the science of clearing slums into the art of historic preservation, died on Oct. 10 at a retirement home in Gainesville, Fla. He was 90 and had played an important role in historic restorations in Charleston, S.C., Savannah, Ga.. Annapolis, Md., Alexandria, Va., and scores of other cities in the United States and abroad.
Mr. Feiss was one of the first of the professional planners who emerged in the 1930's to elevate what had been a grab bag of activities by civil engineers and other municipal officials into a distinct discipline. In the forefront of his field almost from the beginning, he ended his career teaching a new generation of planners at the University of Florida. 
 Mr. Feiss, whose father was a men's clothing manufacturer, grew up in an artistic Cleveland household. (Mr. Feiss was a lifelong painter.) He earned a degree in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania, spent three years teaching at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and then obtained one of the first master's degrees in urban planning offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Within a year of receiving his degree, in 1938 at age 31, he had been made the director of the housing and planning division of the Columbia University School of Architecture. He had also become deeply involved in zoning and other planning issues in New York City.
Although he was so devoted to public construction projects that he once suggested that the much-maligned form might someday produce an American Parthenon, from the start Mr. Feiss was a planner with a difference. He advocated low-density, low-cost development of vacant land and tangled with New York's master builder, Robert Moses, over grandiose plans to build expensive public housing on the rubble of cleared slums.
He then spent five years in Denver, where he ran the city's planning commission, established an urban planning department at the University of Denver and helped found the Denver Art Museum. Mr. Feiss went to Washington in 1950 as the chief planner for slum clearance for the forerunner of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and had an epiphany.
At a time when urban renewal generally meant bulldozing neighborhoods to make way for modern steel-and-concrete structures, Mr. Feiss decided that for all their rundown condition, many buildings being swept away were architectural or historic gems whose restoration could be the basis for renewal of an invaluable municipal heritage.
He left his post in Washington in 1955 and became an independent consultant. He led the campaign that produced the Federal Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and a National Register of Historic Places, and was a sought-after expert on the complexities of historic preservation.
Mr. Feiss, whose clients included state, county and city agencies from Connecticut to Bogota, Colombia, hardly invented the notion of preserving and restoring rundown neighborhoods of architectural or historic significance. The idea, long the province of the docent class, generated almost too much support: at a time when the bulldoze-and-build approach offered the advantage of straightforward simplicity, the trick of historic preservation was to get an assortment of often squabbling civic groups, public agencies, elected officials and private businesses to work together.
Mr. Feiss, who wrote and lectured widely on the subject and all but invented the methodology of preservation, was a master at coordinating an intricate array of tasks: creating an inventory of worthy buildings, mapping district lines, obtaining necessary zoning and other legislation, creating and enacting economic revitalization plans and arranging creative financing.
Success did not occur overnight. He spent seven years working on the Savannah project, for example.
His spirit, determination and attention to detail were not limited to his professional life. On visits to the great James River plantations of Virginia, he would pinch a bit of the ancient boxwoods, then plant them at his home in the Cleveland Park section of Washington, where he would proudly identify each bush by the plantation it was from.
He is survived by his wife, Alleen, of Falls Church, Va.; two daughters, Alison Kriviskey of Falls Church and Caroline Feiss of Seattle; a sister, Gertrude Feiss of New York City, and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Christine Whitman for Governor

 BODY:
For most of this year, the New Jersey gubernatorial race sputtered along with little drama. Early surveys showed Gov. Christine Todd Whitman ahead, helped by the state's improved economy, the drop in crime and welfare rolls and, not least, her record of cutting taxes as she promised four years ago. Lately, James McGreevey, a State Senator and the Mayor of Woodbridge, has gained, hammering the Governor over school standards, soaring property taxes and auto insurance rates. Mrs. Whitman, a rising star in the Republican firmament a few years ago, is fighting back hard in a tight race that is drawing national attention.
Today we endorse Mrs. Whitman for re-election, though the choice was not easy. Mrs. Whitman is an impressive politician with an excellent command of issues. But her 30 percent income-tax cut, which we opposed, has damaged the state's fiscal health because it was largely financed by a raid on the state pension systems. Mrs. Whitman compounded the error this year with a $2.7 billion bond issue to keep the pension system solvent. On the other hand, the Governor has compiled a solid record on the environment and education issues. Her approach to helping people on welfare find work has been humane. She has championed abortion rights, affirmative action and other causes of the moderate wing of the Republican Party. If she wins, she can help her party get beyond its punitive agenda in Washington. 
 There is much to like about Mr. McGreevey, a little-known but energetic politician who came from behind to win the Democratic primary in September. Contrasting his own working-class background with that of the patrician Governor, he has attacked Mrs. Whitman's fiscal policies, called for higher school standards and demanded action to lower New Jersey's car insurance rates, the nation's highest. But Mr. McGreevey has failed to offer a coherent explanation of how he would meet his promises. He cannot escape having voted in the State Legislature for Mrs. Whitman's tax cut, and he has not said where he would get the money to pay for upgrading schools as well as the state aid that would help local districts cut property taxes.
Like many Republicans, Mrs. Whitman entered office promising to bring sensible business practices to government. Her privatization schemes have largely fizzled, but the Governor bargained hard with state unions and in general kept the cost of government under control. The impact of her worst mistakes, the tax and pension schemes, was mitigated by economic good times.
One of the trickiest problems tackled by Mrs. Whitman has been the state's response to State Supreme Court rulings demanding more spending for poor students. The issue has tormented New Jersey governors for over two decades as the state's highest court repeatedly demanded parity in spending between rich and poor districts. Mrs. Whitman's approach has been to argue for moving away from arbitrary spending levels, toward education standards and accountability. The court found merit to her argument but still insisted on more money for impoverished districts. The Governor and the Legislature found the funds, and they now must follow through on their promise to achieve the high standards they say they want.
Like some politicians, Mrs. Whitman is most distinguished by the enemies she has made. The Republican right wing has reviled her for the sin of favoring affirmative action, abortion rights and equal treatment of homosexuals. In backing Senator Bob Dole last year, she warned the party not to turn its back on moderates. In the battles on Capitol Hill over welfare and Medicaid spending, Mrs. Whitman has played a visible role, demanding that Republican Congressional leaders support programs that help the urban centers of the North. The Governor turns aside questions about running for higher office if she wins re-election, a sensible position given her current political troubles. But we hope that with a victory at home, she will not hesitate to demand humane national policies on education, the environment, race and treatment of the poor.

HEADLINE: Study Predicts Food Gap for Poor Countries

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
A survey of what people will be eating -- and feeding their animals -- into the first two decades of the next century finds that problems from rising consumer demands to falling water tables could create huge food gaps in the poorest countries despite their economic growth.
Imports of meat and cereals are likely to rise in countries that once were largely self-sufficient, benefiting exporting nations like the United States, Australia and Argentina but making the cost of feeding families in developing nations higher, says the survey, which was done by a unit of the World Bank. 
 A report on the survey published yesterday, "The World Food Situation: Recent Developments, Emerging Issues and Long-Term Prospects," says that improvements in living standards in a world growing by 80 million people a year put pressure on food stocks at a time when there are no prospects of another green revolution to guarantee increased agricultural yields.
The report says that increases in yields of major cereal crops, including wheat, rice and corn, are expected to slow in the next 25 years, following already slower growth since 1982.
Stepped-up grain production is reaching the limit of what it is possible to produce, especially in Asia, the study found. In the richer countries, especially in Europe, opposition to genetically altered foodstuffs slows research, hurting poorer countries that need larger crops most.
The demand for meat, mostly poultry and beef, is rising everywhere, the report says, but is growing fastest in developing countries. In 1993, poorer countries accounted for 47 percent of the world's meat demand. By 2020, these countries could be consuming 63 percent of meat products.
Given such consumption changes, huge questions loom over China and India, which together have almost half the world's people.
Better living standards and changing tastes that come with urbanization could strain the world's food supplies on a still unpredictable scale, the report's researchers concluded.
The report was prepared by the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington for the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research at the World Bank.

McGreevey Lists Priorities: Schools, a Master Plan and Economic Development

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Oct. 23

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with James E. McGreevey conducted today by editors and reporters from The New York Times.
Q. How would the first state budget, if you are elected, reflect your values? What would be the top three areas where you would seek to increase spending, and then as a follow-up, what would be the areas that you would protect from spending cuts? 
 McGREEVEY There are three broad areas that I think are of essential concern to New Jersey. And how we do it and how we plan for it.
One is the state master plan. Tom Kean developed a master plan, which is basically collecting dust on a shelf. No teeth, no implementation. And the reason why, every mayor has a master plan required by state law to know where there's housing or where there's industrial development and where there's commercial development.
My concern is -- as a state -- is that we've had these tremendous cities in the state of New Jersey and people left our cities and they continue to move out and out and out and out. And by contrast you can drive 60 miles outside of London and still see green hills. Because it's how we approach, we have a disposal-driven mentality. . . .
Secondly, of major concern is education is a critical concern. And we all know the litany. We spend more money than any state in the nation on education, but only a small percentage of that gets in the classroom. Fifty percent more to administrative costs. The standards stink. We don't teach our kids the difference between right and wrong. We don't have school-based performance standards. We don't have a mentoring program. Our students are spending only 42 percent studying core academic subjects. . . .
Q. Let's say, take three state agencies. What would be the agency in state government that you would protect from budget cuts?
A. We were talking about education. We were talking about planning and also talking about economic development. And in terms of the state budget per se -- can I -- I'd like to go back to education for a second and talk about how we spend those dollars.
What I would do, not just in terms of dollars, but in terms of education, I think we need an education blueprint in the state of New Jersey. A specific model of where we want to be. A specific model of what education will look like in the state of New Jersey, between birth and between whether it's secondary school, community college or university training. And that includes an outline of how we're going to spend our resources, what the standards are going to look like and where we're going to put our money. And we know we spend about $12 billion a year on education. But it's also about how we spend that money and what are those standards. . . .
None of this is easy in the sense of developing consensus. I mean, I tore down a town hall in Woodbridge and I had 12 town meetings all throughout Woodbridge to build a consensus. None of this is going to be easy. . . .
We have to spend less on administration. I mean that has to happen. But we have to develop consensus about how that's going to accomplish -- you know -- the obvious cases are the egregious, you know, the buyouts, the quarter of a million dollars of sick time, and how we're going to reduce 50 percent -- we're 50 percent above the national average in administrative costs; how we're going to get more money in the classrooms; what the classroom day is going to look like.
Q. Are you outlining a series of town meetings over nine months?
A. Yes. I would do with people to develop consensus on -- but it, I mean, it's on different focuses. It's on primary, I mean pre-pre-k, primary, secondary and then post-secondary in terms of technical training and univer---- we have excellent universities. That question is more just a question of affordability.
Q. What percentage of your time in the first nine months would you devote to developing this consensus?
A. On education? I would say 20 percent.
Q. Where do you think you'd spend the other 80 percent?
A. In addition to the budget itself, I think another approximately 25 percent of my time would be working with the business community and the labor community in targeting economic development and job opportunities and beginning to develop a rational plan for attracting specific job growth and job industries to the state of New Jersey.
And lastly, the remaining of my time is working with mayors and municipalities, in improving the excellence of municipal government. You know, as Mayor I recognize the limitations that mayors have. But municipal government is the level of government which most directly deals with individual citizens and providing for excellence and also insuring the greatest return for our tax dollar.
Q. Mr. McGreevey, you had said in interviews and on the campaign trail that the tax crisis facing New Jersey residents today is a property tax crisis. And you have talked about, if elected, creating a commission which would then make recommendations on changing the tax structure in New Jersey. What would you ask this commission to look at?
A. The long-term goal is to obviously reduce the reliance on property taxes. Long-term goal.
Short-term goal is to undo the damage that Governor Whitman has wrought on the citizens of the state. And that is the substantial reduction of state aid funding to school districts and municipalities.
The state share has dropped from 42 percent to 37 percent. Middle-class property-tax payers across the state are getting hammered. I would dedicate up to 50 percent of increased revenues to targeting specific for school district property tax relief.
Q. On your auto insurance plan, and we have discussed this, that on your brochure it suggests that you support changes in how auto insurance rates are determined based on geography, based on where you live in New Jersey. And Governor Whitman has strongly suggested that you're telling different audiences in New Jersey different things about your position on this issue, which would lower rates for some urban drivers. However, there's some belief it would increase rates for some suburban drivers.
A. Yes. I would not end demographic rating.
Q. You would not end demographic----
A. Rating or geographic rating. It's not a matter of pitting urban drivers versus suburban drivers. It's a matter of having a governor on the side of the driver as opposed to the insurance company.
The Governor granted 12 discretionary rate increases over the four increases that were automatically given.
The Governor abolished the Public Advocate. Literally, there is no one in the room to represent our interest. It's the insurance companies and the department of insurance. Governor Kean, Governor Byrne, Governor Florio: all had a public advocate to represent our interest. It was this Governor who abolished the Public Advocate. Literally, no one speaks for the public. This system is wholly out of kilter.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lowers Goals on China After Glitches in Early Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
When President Jiang Zemin meets President Clinton on Wednesday in the first state visit of a Chinese leader in a dozen years, there is likely to be a nuclear agreement and possibly one to provide American assistance to clear China's air pollution from its coal-fired power plants.
There will be talk of a new age of economic cooperation, greased by at least $4 billion or more in freshly signed deals, more than half with Boeing. 
 Naturally there will also be plenty of food and plenty of champagne. And the White House will declare, as its top officials have been saying for weeks now, that the main accomplishment of this summit meeting is that it is happening at all.
But that declaration is making a virtue of necessity, senior Administration officials privately admit, because the months of frenzied pre-summit negotiations between Chinese and American officials have produced significantly less than once hoped.
The agreement to get China to reduce its dangerous exports of nuclear expertise will be the substantive centerpiece of Wednesday's meeting, and it will clear the way for billions of dollars in sales of American nuclear power plants to a country whose economic ambitions outstrip its electrical capacity. China has also promised to stop selling anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran, reducing threats to American naval ships in the Persian Gulf and helping to mute Republican criticism of Mr. Jiang's visit.
But the once-feverish discussions about getting China to open its markets to foreign competition, especially with state-owned enterprises that are attempting a perilous transition to private ownership, have all but stalled -- and with it, China's hopes that this summit meeting would speed its entry into the World Trade Organization.
In other areas, progress will be at best incremental, senior officials say, and the main importance of this meeting is to provide a new beginning for what they concede has been the single most badly handled foreign policy of Mr. Clinton's Presidency.
In a speech on Friday, Mr. Clinton reiterated the need for broad engagement with China -- "expanding areas of cooperation, dealing forthrightly with our differences" in order to "advance fundamental American interests and values."
But his defense of this visit by Mr. Jiang seemed passionless, and his critics are bound to argue that Mr. Clinton will not get enough in return for ending America's diplomatic quarantine of China after the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
Representative Christopher H. Smith, a Republican of New Jersey, who will hold hearings on Tuesday on Chinese human-rights abuses, said the summit meeting itself "should never have happened without preconditions on human rights."
"We don't want nice-sounding words and sound-bites," he added. "We want meaningful action for the victims of this dictatorship, which understands only power."
There are already concerns about the 71-year-old Mr. Jiang's reaction to the sight of protesters. He says his host, Mr. Clinton, should "handle these events." Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today on NBC's "Meet the Press" that demonstrations were an example of democracy at work, that the Chinese had dictated their own itinerary, and that Mr. Jiang should not expect "a totally fuzzy time."
The biggest accomplishment of this summit meeting is expected to be a written pledge from China to phase out its nuclear assistance to Iran, even though there is no international obligation to do so.
In return, Mr. Clinton will lift a 12-year American ban on sales to China of nuclear technology for civilian power, which Beijing wants to buy and Westinghouse and ABB Combustion Engineering Nuclear Systems desperately want to sell.
Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, insists that sales of power plants "are the cart, but assurances to end nuclear cooperation with Iran is the horse."
"This is not in the first instance about whether we sell civilian nuclear power to China," he said. "It's about nonproliferation."
But many in Congress question the Administration's willingness to crack down on China for the sale of dangerous materiel to Pakistan and Iran. The issue has become highly politicized; Republicans have accused Mr. Clinton of downplaying alleged Chinese violations of past pledges to stop dangerous exports.
So Mr. Clinton has made security issues like proliferation and restraining North Korea important justifications for deepening American "engagement" with China at the highest level, and for his refusal to allow American policy toward China to rise or fall on human rights.
For the American business community, however, the power plants are the horse. To them, the nuclear sanction is another example of how Washington drives China into the arms of French, Russian and Canadian businesses. America's allies long ago came to terms with post-Tiananmen China, noting that China has possessed nuclear weapons for three decades. And Westinghouse and ABB Combustion Engineering have spent months documenting to lawmakers how sanctions have already cost the United States $16 billion in lost sales.
"Clearly, the Chinese have the capability to build power reactors on their own and get help from others," said R. Ian Butterfield, director of government affairs at Westinghouse, which is ready to swoop as soon as Mr. Clinton signs the waiver. "What they are looking for now is advanced technology, and they are making it clear that they want to standardize on one nuclear-power technology for the country."
Far more business is at stake during this visit, he argues. If China's economy keeps expanding rapidly, the country will need $60 billion in new reactors over the next 15 years, and American companies think the vast majority of that business can be theirs.
But the cost will be high: China wants extensive nuclear power technology transfer, just as it has obtained knowledge from Boeing about building sophisticated aircraft. And it wants assurances that the United States will be a reliable supplier, no matter what the Congressional mood.
Early this year, Mr. Clinton's aides were betting that the meeting's centerpiece would be China's impending entry into the World Trade Organization, a sign of the country's economic arrival. The unspoken part of the deal was that Washington would end the annual Congressional debate over "most favored nation" trade status for China.
But months of negotiations have produced little but doubts over whether Mr. Jiang is truly willing to make the sacrifices to join the W.T.O. -- summit or no summit.
China has missed several deadlines to produce a timetable for dismantling layers of protection and subsidies for China's inefficient state enterprises, which employ nearly two-thirds of the urban population.
After his trip to China last month,Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin reported to President Clinton that Mr. Jiang has considered the political impact of the economic dislocations of joining the W.T.O. -- and was aware that opening markets too fast could worsen the pain. "He is quite realistic about the challenges of making this work," Mr. Rubin concluded.
The economic crisis unfolding in Asia may further slow that opening, especially if Mr. Jiang concludes that a battered Hong Kong will not prove to be a cash cow, helping to pay for the privatization of Chinese enterprises. The first stock offering in two of those companies, including the huge China National Aviation Corporation, were indefinitely postponed over the weekend.
China's rethinking of when to enter the W.T.O. is understandable. Investors poured $42 billion into the country last year, roughly 40 percent of global investment in developing nations. Its growth is double digit and even without Hong Kong, it now has foreign currency reserves of an astounding $130 billion. Because Congress has consistently extended "most-favored nation" status to China, the Chinese are enjoying all the biggest benefits of joining the W.T.O. -- low tariffs for exports -- without any of the responsibilties of membership.
"The Chinese know that they only get into the W.T.O. one way -- on commercially acceptable terms," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. But some experts wonder if the American position is shortsighted.
"I think the U.S. side made a mistake and should have recalibrated its approach," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, who argues that it is better to get China inside the tent, preventing it from backtracking on past liberalizations. "Unless there is a change in policy there is a risk that China stays out indefinitely."
At every meeting, the Americans ask that dissidents like Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng be granted medical parole. They also want Red Cross visits to Chinese prisons and an institutionalized "dialogue" on human rights, an end to religious repression in Tibet and elsewhere, and continued freedoms in Hong Kong. The Chinese respond, almost ritually, that these are purely internal affairs.

On being endorsed by the editorial boards of The New York Times, Newsday and The Daily News yesterday, as he walked down Broadway. 
 "I'm always surprised when you get endorsements. I'm very happy we got them. Actually, the last time I didn't have The Times and the Newsday endorsement. The News endorsed me the last time that I ran, but The Times and Newsday did not. We feel that the administration has worked very hard, and we were very proud that we were able to obtain those endorsements. But ultimately it's Nov. 4 that counts. Endorsements, polls.

"Friends, I pledge to you, in the spirit of the West Side, in the spirit of the borough of Manhattan, an administration true to the principles of my colleagues who just spoke, true to the work that Barney Frank has done in Congress for many years, a city in which we will grow the economy and create jobs for New Yorkers, a city in which we will fight to stop police brutality, a city in which we will invest in our children and their teachers and their principals, so that everybody is learning. And I pledge to you a city in which we all work together, in which the new mayor is plenty tough, but is not mean, does not bully, does not divide and prosecute and persecute.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE DEMOCRAT;
McGreevey Says Education Plan Would Be His Legacy as Governor

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Oct. 23

 BODY:
Detailing how he would spend much of his time as governor, James E. McGreevey, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, said today that his focus in a first term would be on public education, economic development and carrying out a master plan for growth in the state.
In an hourlong interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times's printing plant here, Mr. McGreevey offered his most specific breakdown to date of what his priorities would be if he were to win the election on Nov. 4, and said that education would consume a great deal of his time. 
 "I think we need an education blueprint in the state of New Jersey," Mr. McGreevey said. "A specific model of where we want to be. A specific model of what education will look like in the state of New Jersey, between birth and between whether it's secondary school, community college or university training."
If he were successful in his bid to unseat the state's Republican Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, Mr. McGreevey said he would spend his first nine months in office holding town meetings and trying to build a consensus on education among parents, teachers and administrators. The focus of those meetings, he said, would be how resources should be used and what curriculum standards should be required. Education alone, he estimated, would dominate 20 percent of his time in office during a first term.
Mr. McGreevey said he would cut administrative spending in schools and try to get more of those dollars into classrooms. And he referred to curriculum standards used in other parts of the country -- like a Harvard University model used in Massachusetts schools and a University of Chicago model used in Chicago schools -- as examples that New Jersey should follow.
"I can say now that I'd scrap this Governor's standards," Mr. McGreevey said.
During the first year of his term, Mr. McGreevey said, he would not change the way education is financed. He said he felt that the State Supreme Court's recent mandate to give more money to poorer districts had achieved parity on an interim basis and that he would not propose any changes in spending until the final three years of a first term.
"What I need to grapple with is to insure that the money that's being spent now is spent wisely and appropriately," he said. "This isn't about telling everybody what they want to hear," he said in response to the fact that not all school districts are happy with the current spending plan. "For now, it stays the same."
Mr. McGreevey, a State Senator who is also the Mayor of Woodbridge, has been able to draw almost even with the Governor in public opinion polls largely through his unrelenting focus on the state's high auto insurance costs and property taxes. Yet while he continued to reiterate his plans to force a reduction in auto insurance rates and relieve property taxes with more state assistance to municipalities, he made it clear during the interview that he would like the betterment of education to be his ultimate legacy.
Relaxed and seeming to enjoy the fierce final days of the campaign, Mr. McGreevey was at times playful, yet constantly concerned about the image he was projecting during the interview. He anxiously joked about his syntax. "Is this verbatim, this transcript?" he asked, pointing to the tape recorder in front of him. And at one point, after inadvertently slouching back in his chair, he admonished a photographer: "Don't take my picture while I'm lying all the way back here," he said. "I look too relaxed."
Mr. McGreevey referred often to the policies and programs of other states' governors -- most of them Republicans -- to illustrate how he would also govern. He cited New York's Governor, George E. Pataki, as an example of someone who had successfully used union labor for state projects.
He said he would follow the examples of North Carolina's Governor, James B. Hunt Jr., and Indiana's former Governor, Evan Bayh, who focused on specific industries for growth in their states. And he pointed to the former Governor of Massachusetts, William F. Weld, who had successfully spurned development on the environmentally hazardous industrial tracts known as brownfields.
Often referring to his tenure as Mayor of Woodbridge, Mr. McGreevey said he would draw from that experience to take on the far more formidable challenges of running the state. For example, he said, his experience in bringing together knowledgeable people to redraw Woodbridge's garbage collection routes would lend itself to the task of revamping the state's public school system.
"It's about bringing people into the process," he said. "In terms of education, I want to bring in the best minds for educational excellence."
He said that his priorities in education were primary and secondary schools, but that he was also committed to spending $57 million on an urban-based, early childhood education program and that he also wanted to keep tuition costs down at state colleges and universities.
Mr. McGreevey linked his proposed educational initiatives to his economic development plan. He said he would choose the biotechnology, telecommunications and plastics industries for growth in the state, and he would then plan school curriculums to address the specific skills required of jobs in those industries.
And even though Mrs. Whitman's first term is concluding with the economy's moving at a healthy pace and with the state's unemployment rate at its lowest in years, Mr. McGreevey continued his assault on the Governor's economic development record, contending that most of the 190,000 jobs that had been created under her watch were low-paying, service-oriented positions and that she did not have an "overarching plan" for growth and development. "This Governor doesn't have a game plan," he asserted.
Mr. McGreevey said that he would adopt a master plan created under Thomas H. Kean, the former Republican Governor, as a guide in developing a long-term outlook on how the state should evolve. "One of the first things that I'd like to do is that we need to have a plan, and I think the master plan provides that, as to where New Jersey is going," he said. "Whether it's residential development, whether it's investment in infrastructure, whether it's targeting economic development to our cities, whether it's housing. There needs to be a plan."
Mr. McGreevey said he would seek to offer commercial tax abatements to provide for business development around the state's ports in Newark, Elizabeth and Camden. The state, he said, should be "aggressively" using the ports as a point of distribution and assembly for products going in and out of the country. "We're talking about a $20 billion economic engine where we're taking products in from around the world and sending them out," he said. "We ought to be putting them together or taking them apart."
Mr. McGreevey continued his well-seasoned attacks on the Governor for using a bond sale to balance the budget and to address pension liabilities, even though he similarly took on debt to balance the Woodbridge municipal budget when he became Mayor. The difference, he insisted, was that he inherited a fiscal problem, but the Governor created one by borrowing from the pension plan in previous years. "The Governor caused the harm, then cured the harm, then wants to get praise for the cure," Mr. McGreevey said.
Mr. McGreevey, a 40-year-old native of central New Jersey's working-class suburbs, contrasted his upbringing with Mrs. Whitman's affluent background. "The fundamental difference between the Governor and I is where we come from," he said.
Holding a State Senate seat and mayoral post simultaneously throughout most of the 1990's has kept Mr. McGreevey in a perpetual state of campaigning, and he waxed romantic during the interview about his affection for the political stump.
"No where else in life would I have had the chance to meet so many people with so many different experiences," he said. "If you love people, if you love life, it's a great opportunity." A professed workaholic who is separated from his wife, Mr. McGreevey said that the only significant other in his life these days is "the undecided voter."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
A Potential Rival Is Depicted as 'From the Left'

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:

PRODUCER -- Russo, Marsh and Raper, Sacramento, Calif.
 
ON THE SCREEN -- The advertisement, a parody of the introduction to "Crossfire," the CNN political debate program, begins with a blurry picture of Geraldine A. Ferraro, who serves as a commentator on the show. Over music reminiscent of the "Crossfire" theme, an announcer introduces Ms. Ferraro, as the words "From The Left," appear on the screen. The announcer's words appear as he speaks about Ms. Ferraro's congressional voting record on taxes, welfare and balancing the budget. A picture of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato then appears, beside which are the words "On Our Side." As the announcer touts Mr. D'Amato's record, the words appear on the screen. 

THE TEXT -- "Next, in the crossfire, from the left: Geraldine Ferraro. Ferraro voted repeatedly for higher taxes on New Yorkers. She supported more welfare and opposed workfare. She even voted against the balanced budget amendment. And on our side: Al D'Amato. D'Amato voted repeatedly to cut our taxes. He led the fight for workfare, not welfare. And he co-sponsored the balanced budget amendment. From the left, it's Geraldine Ferraro. And on our side, it's Al D'Amato."
 
ACCURACY -- The ad exaggerates Ms. Ferraro's positions on raising taxes. In 1981, Ms. Ferraro voted against a measure to cut income tax rates by 25 percent across the board, part of President Ronald Reagan's landmark package of tax and spending cuts. In 1984, she voted for the adoption of a conference committee report on a bill to raise $50 billion in new taxes. But the bill, which also included spending cuts and was intended to reduce the deficit by $63 billion over four years, was also supported by President Reagan, who signed it. Mr. D'Amato opposed it.
 
On welfare, Ms. Ferraro frequently assailed the Reagan Administration's welfare cuts, which she contended were too harsh and provided no mechanism to move people from welfare to self sufficiency. She voted in 1979 for a bill that would establish a national minimum welfare benefit. The same year, she voted against an amendment to a bill that would have allowed states to establish work requirements for welfare recipients.
On the budget, Ms. Ferraro did join 167 other Democrats and 20 Republicans who in 1982 voted down a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would have required a balanced budget. Those who opposed the measure contended that it could tie the hands of the Government and damage its ability to stimulate the economy during slow periods.
 
SCORECARD -- Deftly playing on her role as the more liberal commentator on "Crossfire," Mr. D'Amato's ad effectively uses Ms. Ferraro's high-profile position to portray her as a public figure still proud to be known ideologically as "from the left." And it concentrates on two pocketbook issues important to many voters in an era of shrinking government: taxes and welfare spending.
But the ad's contentions about Ms. Ferraro's positions are presented with no context and could ring somewhat hollow for viewers, many of whom will recall that her last policy-making job was more than a dozen years ago. RANDY KENNEDY

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE MAYOR;
Experts Call Giuliani's Term One of Modest Achievement

SERIES: RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Incumbent's Record

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The most devastating charge Rudolph W. Giuliani made against David N. Dinkins in 1993 was that Mr. Dinkins had allowed city government to slip from his control. Mr. Giuliani then spent about 18 hours a day for the next four years making sure that no one ever accused him of the same thing. And no one has.
Measured against the recent standards of New York City history, in fact, the city's 107th Mayor has exercised the most muscular use of government power in many years, combining good fortune and limitless self-confidence to banish the gloomy hesitancy that so long hung over City Hall. 
 By improving the effectiveness of the Police Department -- the most conspicuous agency of the city government -- Mr. Giuliani was able to persuade many New Yorkers that a host of seemingly intractable urban ills, from murder and organized crime to panhandling, could actually be tamed.
Not all of the city's 40 percent reduction in overall crime can be traced directly to him, but through force of will and communications bravado, Mr. Giuliani translated the dry statistics into a tangible feeling of security for a broad swath of the city.
No one was more surprised by the magnitude of the year-after-year crime drops than the Mayor, whose innovations in policing were enhanced by an unexpectedly strong trend toward civil order in cities around the country.
But New York's predominance in reducing crime became the perfect symbol for Mr. Giuliani's striking success in converting national trends into personal accomplishments, making the office of mayor seem far more potent than it actually is.
His timing, in that sense, has been unerring: he began his well-known quality-of-life campaign just as business improvement districts were having their greatest impact cleaning up the city's most visited commercial areas, and just when years of planning to rebuild Times Square were coming to fruition. The reductions in crime, coming as the national recession ended and Wall Street profits began to boom, led to substantial improvements in business and tourism against a backdrop of a suddenly alluring Manhattan. As New York's sense of its own capability began to return, the Mayor was there to act as its shepherd, just as he led the parade when the Yankees won the World Series last year.
But an examination of the Mayor's record in the world beyond law enforcement shows that it often falls short of his assertion that he has turned the city around. In area after area -- long-term balancing of the budget, municipal workers' productivity, reshaping the school system, moving people from welfare to meaningful, full-time work, reducing homelessness, improving race relations -- Mr. Giuliani's performance has not matched his self-appraisals.
Many impartial experts in urban affairs say that Mr. Giuliani's real achievement is considerably more modest than a full-scale renaissance of New York City. They view him as having achieved greater efficiency rather than a true transformation of local government, as having restored an impression of order to the governance of New York rather than meaningful, lasting discipline in such areas as city spending or police behavior. Those, in and of themselves, are not inconsiderable accomplishments for someone in office less than four years, but they are not as all encompassing as the Mayor claims.
Peter C. Goldmark Jr., the departing president of the Rockefeller Foundation and a prominent local government official for many years, called the reduction in crime "a towering achievement" that has fundamentally changed the prevailing opinion of New York City. But he gave Mr. Giuliani much lower marks on education and race relations, and said the administration had made no lasting changes to the way the city spends money or builds.
"If I were putting him in the gallery of mayors alongside the six I've known, I'd put him in the lone ranger category," said Mr. Goldmark, who was chief of staff to former Mayor John V. Lindsay, the last Republican Mayor before Mr. Giuliani. "He hasn't built any broad alliances, or brought in any large portions of population. He is a battler who has taken on enemies when they presented themselves, but he has not fundamentally changed the way the city operates."
William B. Eimicke, director of the program on politics and public policy at Columbia University, said that only two basic issues had received the Mayor's full attention: public safety and fiscal policy. Mr. Eimicke argued that this narrow focus made Mr. Giuliani a good mayor, because he had followed through on the areas he said were important to him, but not a great mayor, because he had failed to expand his vision beyond its core.
"Those were good priorities, and he mapped out that course and stuck to it," said Mr. Eimicke, an authority on urban innovation around the country. "But the job of mayor is more than that. Other mayors have gone beyond that core and found ways to be more creative and deliver services better. The question for the next four years is, will he become a reinvention mayor and go beyond just being good? Can he really be great? The jury is out on that."
Mr. Giuliani can be merciless to a commissioner whose department is performing poorly, but outside the tightly closed doors of his inner circle, he is loath to acknowledge blemishes on his record. In an interview last week, he rebutted every criticism leveled at him, maintaining that New York's turnaround was not only virtually complete but also greater than any other city's. Where critics see deficiencies, he sees accomplishments overlooked.
"A lot of what we've done is ignored, because it doesn't fit somebody's classical model, but it's quite significant, quite a significant turnaround," he said between campaign appearances. "I don't know of any city that's had the kind of turnaround that we've had in the last three years. Not just in crime, but in the delivery of services, the mood of the people. We used to be a city where no one wanted to come to, and now you can't get a hotel room."
His biggest accomplishment, he said, has been ridding the city of a sense of helplessness and restoring hope. "People used to say the city was unmanageable, that it couldn't be run, that it was ungovernable," he said. "Now people believe the city can have success."
 
The Vision
Innovation In Limited Doses
Mr. Giuliani ran on a platform of rethinking and reinventing government, and even now argues that his law-enforcement techniques and workfare program constitute the country's greatest urban innovations. But unlike other mayors in Chicago, Philadelphia or Houston to whom he is often compared, Mr. Giuliani has neither fundamentally changed the city's relationships with the unions representing its workers, whose wages remain the city's biggest expenditure, nor achieved the extensive program of privatization he once promised.
In his first year in office, the Mayor put a few small road and park contracts up for bidding, but the effort halted after he decided not to further challenge the municipal unions, most of which have endorsed him for re-election. His plan to sell three city hospitals stalled in the face of legal and political opposition.
Mr. Giuliani has reduced the size of the work force and the rate of growth in city spending, while cutting taxes slightly for businesses and instituting an atmosphere of retrenchment at City Hall, all moves that have been received warmly by the financial community. But without exception, the outside government agencies and private companies that monitor the budget have warned that these actions have not gone nearly far enough. The city's bond rating, which declined under Mr. Giuliani, has not risen amid all the talk of a renaissance, and spending has continued to grow.
Though some city functions are now more efficient, other agencies with budgets that were cut are simply doing less with less. Polls show that most residents, for example, do not share his opinion that the city is now cleaner than ever.
"Giuliani has been good for New York's image, but he hasn't really tried to change the political culture of the city like they have in Houston or Indianapolis," said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in Malibu, Calif., who writes frequently on the country's mayors. "It's harder in New York because of the power of the public employee unions, but he's really been disappointing when it comes to pushing thoroughgoing civic reforms."
Nor has Mr. Giuliani always lived up to his inaugural image as a clean-cut reformer. The practice of rewarding friends and political allies with jobs has hardly ceased despite the Mayor's insistence that he does not engage in patronage, and two of his closest allies and advisers have been allowed to build up lucrative practices lobbying city agencies. As in most administrations, the quality of the Mayor's appointments has been mixed, with a few acclaimed commissioners and many more who have remained anonymous, mostly because of Mr. Giuliani's policy of being the spokesman for anything good that happens within the city.
 
The Message
A Willingness To Confront
 Much of the Mayor's surging popularity is due to his intuitive understanding of the fears and desires of the city's middle class, his most reliable voting bloc, and of the business community.
He forged a new style of politics for a city accustomed to years of paternalism from its leaders, angering traditional liberals by making social benefits much harder to get, while defying his fellow Republicans with his constant promotion of the rights of immigrants. The mixture has not proved popular among many black residents and has done little to heal the city's racial rifts, but it has brought together a pragmatic coalition of recent immigrants, ethnic whites, Jews, and many Hispanics in an assertion of power rooted in the boroughs beyond Manhattan.
He seemed to immediately grasp the symbolic effect of ignoring prominent black critics like the Rev. Al Sharpton, long a critic of the white establishment, after a police incident at a Harlem mosque two weeks after he took over from the city's first black Mayor. He knew that his very visible willfulness in pursuing squeegee men and graffiti writers would buy him the reputation he needed for future confrontations.
Earlier this year, the Mayor was able to benefit from that reputation, along with some quick and dramatic action, to emerge without serious political damage from a case involving charges of serious police abuse in Brooklyn. Although black and Hispanic New Yorkers have long complained that the crackdown on crime has led to increased police harassment, the Mayor's base seemed unconcerned, and polls show that his support among blacks has risen substantially from 1993.
"That rebuilding of confidence was his greatest accomplishment," said Fred Siegel, a professor of history at Cooper Union whose new book, "The Future Once Happened Here," casts a skeptical eye on the accomplishments and failures of Mr. Giuliani and other big-city mayors. "He brought to an end that whole evacuation mentality of the middle class that you used to hear at dinner parties in the early 90's."
The Mayor was two years ahead of the national mood on welfare reform, and never fails to remind middle-class audiences that he created the country's largest workfare program. As a result, the number of people on welfare in New York City has declined to 780,000, a decrease of 320,000, saving $700 million to date. But the city's program, criticized for its lack of dignity by religious groups, has made little effort to find real jobs for those on welfare, and the city has not tried to track what happened to those who left the rolls. The Mayor said his goal is not to find "meaningful jobs," but to make people less dependent on government.
Similarly, the Mayor knew exactly what the business community wanted to see and hear after its dissatisfaction with former Mayor David N. Dinkins: tax cuts, fewer regulations, an open door. The tax cuts, 82 percent of which have gone to businesses, have been small, but along with the effort to drive organized crime out of the private garbage-hauling industry and from wholesale markets, they have helped send a message that the city is a better place in which to do business.
"When we now talk to businesses about coming to New York, crime is no longer on the list of concerns," said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the New York City Investment Fund, a private group established to funnel corporate funds into job creation and development in neighborhoods around the city. "I think the consensus in the business community is he deserves credit for convincing people that he is a tight fiscal manager, and that he has focused on issues of serious concern for folks who are watching the economy of the city."
While the city's economy has gained notable strength in recent months, the unemployment rate, at 9.3 percent, is nearly twice the national average. And while the city's economy is creating jobs at a quicker pace than at any time this decade, New York City still has not gained back all the private sector jobs it lost during the recession of the late 1980's.
 
The Technique
Dogged Leadership, At Times, to a Fault
The one area where polls show the Mayor badly misjudged the public mood was in his treatment of the school system. Mr. Giuliani slashed the requested budget of the Board of Education for his first two years in office by $1.2 billion, chasing Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines out of town with withering attacks. Only in his final year, facing widespread public criticism as buildings crumbled and students were packed into hallways, did he join forces with a new Chancellor and begin putting money back into the schools.
The Mayor acknowledges that the performance of the schools has not measured up to his hopes, which he said is understandable because he still does not have direct control over the system.
The downside of his well-known eagerness to demonstrate control and accept accountability has been the peremptory, sometimes abusive treatment given to those who displeased him, including Mr. Cortines and former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton. The administration's reluctance to discuss anything but its own successes has led to a large number of lawsuits from other public officials, civic groups, and journalists whose requests for information have been rejected.
Still, the Mayor's techniques have been effective, particularly because polls have shown that city residents want their mayor to be an aggressive manager and a tireless cheerleader, and Mr. Giuliani has unquestionably filled the bill. City residents never expected crime to fall so far, and having enjoyed the benefits, New Yorkers seem inclined to give the Mayor a great deal of maneuvering room on everything else.
"Giuliani is a shining example of the advantages of diminished expectations," Mr. Kotkin said. "People are used to being disappointed by government. With Giuliani, at least they can say, 'Hey, this guy did something.' "
 
Race for City Hall
Future articles will examine the specifics of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's record on certain issues, and Ruth W. Messinger's record as Manhattan Borough President and as a Councilwoman.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL DEFICIT AT LOWEST POINT IN TWO DECADES

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
President Clinton will announce on Monday that the Federal budget deficit has fallen to $22.6 billion, the lowest since the early 1970's, largely because of strong economic growth that brought a surge in tax revenue, Administration officials said today.
The figure, covering the Government fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, was within the range predicted by economists and Congressional analysts in recent weeks. It capped a year in which the economy drove down the deficit at a stunning rate, even before the balanced-budget agreement, reached by the White House and Congress this summer, took effect. 
 The Administration had started the year expecting a deficit of $128 billion, and as recently as late summer, both the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office were predicting a deficit of $34 billion to $36 billion.
In dollar terms, the deficit has not been so low since 1974, when it was $6.1 billion. As a percentage of the nation's economic output, the deficit now stands at less than three-tenths of 1 percent, equaling or perhaps slightly lower than in 1970, the year after the Government last had a budget surplus.
Mr. Clinton will announce the figure, which is based on the Treasury Department's final calculations of the Government's expenditures and tax receipts for the year, when he delivers a speech on the economy to the Democratic Leadership Council in Washington, Administration officials said.
As an economic matter, analysts said, the deficit is now so low that it almost does not matter whether it is eliminated. It is far below that of any other big industrialized nation, and is one reason the United States has enjoyed a combination of steady growth, low inflation, low unemployment and heavy business investment in new technology, economists said.
But the deficit's political symbolism remains important, not least to Mr. Clinton. His aides have long said they hope to make the nation's restored fiscal health one of his most powerful legacies. And with a shrinking deficit, the annual budget process, so long focused on partisan fights over spending cuts and tax increases, are undergoing an abrupt twist.
Republicans in Congress are already talking openly about the deficit being wiped out well in advance of the 2002 deadline set in the balanced-budget accord, and are debating how best to spend any surpluses. While some Republicans want to pay down the national debt, which continues to grow, others are eager to use any surpluses for annual tax cuts or to increase spending on politically attractive projects like roads and bridges.
Administration officials have been more cautious, saying that the deficit is likely to increase again next year, partly because of tax cuts, and that there is no assurance the budget will be balanced before 2002. Yet even within the White House, an effort is under way to determine how best to allocate any surpluses, and how an improving budget picture would influence problems like the long-term solvency of Social Security.
But economists and budget analysts said it was far from certain that the good fiscal news would continue unabated, even if the economy continued to grow at a healthy pace.
Some of the deficit's fall since 1992 -- when it peaked, in dollar terms, at $290.4 billion -- can be attributed to painful steps taken in Washington, particularly the tax increases of 1990 under the Bush Administration and of 1993 under Mr. Clinton. But much of the reduction in the last few years resulted from an economy that grew faster than expected -- and that generated tax revenues at a pace surprising even for such an elevated rate of growth.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the House Budget Committee this month that "much of the fiscal improvement of recent years is less the result of a return to the prudent attitudes and actions of earlier generations than the emergence of benevolent forces" -- among them the end of the cold war and the ensuing drop in military spending, the economy's recent ability to grow without inflation, and the breathtaking rise in stock prices.
Economists inside and outside the Government said it seemed likely, in fact, that the surging stock market deserves a good portion of the credit for the surprisingly fast decline in the deficit. They said a substantial portion of the unexpectedly high tax revenues appears to be coming from capital gains, as investors cash in on rapidly rising share prices.
Some gains, they said, may be coming from people who are being paid with stock options or with bonuses that are linked directly or indirectly to the performance of their companies' stock prices.
"The area of uncertainty is, to some extent, how long will this surge in the stock market go on," June O'Neill, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, said several weeks ago.
For all the progress in reducing the deficit, it is also a matter of debate among members of Congress and among economists whether it is fair to say that the budget is approaching balance. That is because the Government's accounting allows it to include the surplus of Social Security tax revenues over outlays -- a surplus that for 1996 was $66 billion -- in its deficit calculations, even though Social Security is technically not considered to be part of the Federal budget.

HEADLINE: Legal Bills Soar in Fund-Raising Inquiries

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
When Dan Denning went to work for the National Policy Forum, a defunct Republican think tank, little did he imagine that three years later he would be hauled before two Congressional investigative committees and a grand jury. After all, he was just a mid-level financial officer, he said, who did nothing more than persuade lawyers to approve bank loans for the organization.
But today, the Forum, which was closely aligned with the Republican National Committee, is under scrutiny as a conduit for possibly illegal campaign donations, and Mr. Denning's knowledge of its inner workings is of great interest to Congressional and Justice Department investigators. 
 Although he says he has always played by the rules, Mr. Denning did not want to face the inquiries without a lawyer. Now, he says, his life has been turned upside down. He has $20,000 in legal bills and has had to take out a home equity loan.
"I could understand if I had my hand in the cookie jar," said Mr. Denning, now an officer at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. "But I've tried to live my life by the rules. And when something like this happens, you have to get a lawyer. You've got no choice."
Mr. Denning is not alone. The number of people drawn into the campaign finance inquiry, both central figures and ordinary people with useful information, has grown into the hundreds, according to Richard Hertling, a spokesman for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, who said it was impossible to come up with a precise figure. Multiple investigations, by Congress, the Justice Department and various Government agencies, may make this the most costly political inquiry in recent times -- and a veritable bonanza for a small group of lawyers expert in the campaign finance law.
The scope is enormous: the Justice Department has a 120-person group calling witnesses, and Attorney General Janet Reno said recently that it had issued 500 subpoenas to date. Two Congressional committees with $10 million budgets have called 370 witnesses for depositions and issued over 700 subpoenas. A grand jury has been convened in Washington. The Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Election Commission have their own questions.
The highest legal bills are those of the Democratic National Committee, at $9.7 million by the end of this year. About $5.2 million has gone to lawyers -- mainly Debevoise & Plimpton, the party's outside counsel -- who represent former officials, and the rest for the production of documents. The committee has had to hire 34 people to review the 800,000 documents sought.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, has spent $1.2 million on outside lawyers since the investigations began.
While most people facing questions have to pay out of their own pockets, both parties are footing the bills for their top employees.
This has prompted Steve Grossman, the Democratic chairman, to complain that so much lawyering is "a clear Republican stategy to paralyze us."
"If they can cause the D.N.C. to spend so much time dealing with hearings," Mr. Grossman said, "it will take so much financial and human resources that the Republicans can pick up all the marbles in the 1997 and 1998 races."
The Republicans, in turn, have their own spin. Michael Madigan, the Senate investigating committee's chief counsel, said, "If the D.N.C. is paying for you and you are an ex-employee, you are less inclined to say something that might be harmful to them when they are paying for you."
The Democratic committee's deep pockets do not extend to the White House or Clinton-Gore re-election employees, even though President Clinton said last August that he would "do everything I can" to raise money for the legal bills of members of the White House staff. The President will pay for his own campaign finance-related legal expenses from a $2.5 million defense fund established to take care of bills from the Whitewater investigation and other personal matters. Harold M. Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, is paying his $200,000 legal bills from his own pocket and Dick Morris, the former Clinton political adviser, gets his legal work for free, from a friend who calculates the cost at $200,000.
"The legal bills are dramatic and substantial," said Robert Bauer, a Washington lawyer retained by the Democratic Party. "Legal representation for these kinds of things is extraordinarily time consuming. And then there are the aftershocks. These are other groups and individuals who are not immediately involved in the process, but fear they may be. They are suddenly more focused on seeking legal help."
The Justice Department will reimburse Government employees if it determines it is in the interest of the United States to do so. Sheila N. Heslin, a former National Security Council employee who tried to keep Roger Tamraz, a pipeline entrepreneur who donated $300,000, out of the White House, has made such a request.
"Ms. Heslin is a prime example of someone who did the right thing," said her lawyer, Richard Janis. "And now the Government is telling her she has to pay her own legal bills while others, including a top D.N.C. official who tried to pressure her, are getting legal support from their political organizations."
Ms. Heslin could have been accompanied before the Senate Committee by a Justice Department lawyer, but since Justice is also investigating the matters she is testifying about, she declined because of the conflict of interest, Mr. Janis added.
Ms. Heslin, currently unemployed, faces bills in the "tens of thousands of dollars," Mr. Janis said. "Sheila Heslin had no prior experience dealing with such matters. She was interviewed by the F.B.I., the C.I.A., Justice and the Senate committee on matters relating to classified information. She was required to be vigilant to avoid unintentional disclosure of classified information and her testimony was not helpful to a number of people. It is understandable she sought legal assistance."
In some cases, it is unclear who is paying the legal bills. A Washington lawyer, Reid Weingarten, would not disclose how much he is being paid or by whom for his two clients: Charlie Trie, the Little Rock, Ark., restaurateur who raised questionable cash for President Clinton's legal defense fund that was later returned, and Pauline Kanchanalak, the international consultant whose $253,000 in donations to the Democrats was also returned.
When Haley Barbour, the former Republican Party chairman and former head of the National Policy Forum, appeared before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, he was accompanied by six lawyers, courtesy of the Republican National Committee. The committee has spent the better part of its $1.2 million in legal fees on Mr. Barbour, who is also the subject of a grand jury investigation.
The inquiry focuses on a loan obtained by the Forum from a Hong Kong businessman that helped the Republican Party, as well as on donations, later returned because they were illegal, from the businessman's company to the Republican Party.
Then there are the Buddhist nuns who appeared in ceremonial garb before the Senate committee to testify about a fund-raising event by Vice President Al Gore at their Los Angeles temple. The nuns have spent "six figures plus," according to their lawyer, Brian Sun, to respond to Senate subpoenas, depositions and requests for documents. The nuns' legal bills are paid by the Temple.
Mr. Sun said his other client, Johnny Chung, the Taiwanese-American businessman who visited the White House more than 50 times during the 1995-96 campaign, was also facing six-figure legal bills, although Mr. Sun would not say whether Mr. Chung or someone else is paying.
"It's as though someone has stuck a hand in your pocket and will continue to stick you up until they are satisfied," said Mr. Denning, the former Forum financial officer. "The Senate Committee has got millions and the Justice Department has more attorneys than God. They don't think about the cost to the average citizen of putting them through this process."
Mr. Madigan, the Senate committee's chief Republican counsel, defended the process. "For this committee to do its job," he said, "it needs to get information. And it has the authority to obtain that information. A number of the people we interviewed had no need for a lawyer in the first place. They were witnesses and not the target of anything. All they were being asked is to state the facts. But many came with lawyers."
Some of those subpoenaed worked for nonprofit organizations that are going back to donors to cover their legal bills.
Peter Flaherty, head of Citizens for Reform, a nonprofit group that ran ads supporting Republicans, said that his legal bills were $100,000 and that he had gotten the money by appealing to conservative donors on First Amendment grounds. "Money for lawyers is the hardest money to raise and we're lucky our donors are willing to put it up," Mr. Flaherty said.
One leading figure who has escaped legal bills is Mr. Tamraz, the pipeline promoter who elbowed his way into the White House. He appeared at his depositions and as a witness without counsel. According to Senate lawyers, Mr. Tamraz showed up for an initial interview with a lawyer who, once he started objecting and telling Mr. Tamraz not to speak, was never seen again.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CAMPAIGNING;
Giuliani Goes After Voters In Messinger's Stronghold

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began the last week of campaigning yesterday with a foray into the heart of Ruth W. Messinger's base on the Upper West Side, even as he warned his supporters across the city not to grow overconfident. Meanwhile, Ms. Messinger, trailing in the polls and short on money, insisted that the mayoral race was not over and pleaded for votes in four boroughs.
Mr. Giuliani, buoyed by the editorial-page endorsements of three of the city's daily newspapers yesterday, marched down Broadway between 86th and 80th Streets, throwing himself into receptive sidewalk crowds, getting spontaneous applause at Ollie's restaurant and making brief stops at two of the neighborhood's culinary citadels, H&H Bagels and Zabar's. 
 The move into the heart of Ms. Messinger's neighborhood reflected the growing confidence of the Mayor, who had spent the previous week shoring up his base of support in the more conservative white ethnic neighborhoods outside Manhattan. Its symbolism was not lost on either candidate, even though the Mayor took pains to deflect attention from it.
"I've lived on the Upper West Side for 11 years of my life," the Mayor said, referring to a period in the 1970's, "so it wasn't as if I felt that I was going some place I hadn't been before. I've been there many times as Mayor. I was there as a candidate last time. I campaigned on the Upper West Side both times I ran for Mayor. So, no, it wasn't intended to have anything to do with the opposition. It's intended to say to the people of the Upper West Side: I want your vote."
Ms. Messinger, who also stumped on the Upper West Side, played down the Mayor's appearance in her political redoubt, saying, "There's room for both of us on the West Side."
Later, walking through a street fair on Broadway between 96th and 110th Streets, she added, "There are two people who told me they saw him in Zabar's and told him to leave the West Side." (In fact, Mr. Giuliani entered the store, saw that access was hindered by the crowds near the cash registers and quickly left.)
Joined by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, Ms. Messinger told listeners in the neighborhood that "in the spirit of the West Side" she pledged "a city in which we all work together, in which the new mayor is plenty tough, but is not mean, does not bully, does not divide and prosecute and persecute."
Ms. Messinger began the day by campaigning in the mostly Jewish section of Midwood, Brooklyn, along Avenue J. Later, she stopped at the Caraville Restaurant on Avenue M, greeting diners and waiters. And she attended morning services at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem, where she was acknowledged by the pastor but did not speak. She attended the annual brunch of the Benjamin Franklin Democratic Club in Riverdale, the Bronx, with Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, Public Advocate Mark Green and others.
In those appearances, and later in Queens, Ms. Messinger seemed to be appealing to her listeners not to abandon hope. "The best way that you counter the polls," she told the Bronx club members, "every single one of you, is to understand that this election doesn't happen for another nine days, that you can in fact each call 10 people every night, tell them who you're voting for."
Mr. Giuliani's warm reception in a famously liberal district was the latest vivid reminder of how much his Democratic rival has to overcome a week before Election Day. Last week, polls showed Ms. Messinger still struggling to gain citywide name recognition; campaign finance records showed her with $46,343 remaining, compared with the Mayor's $1.6 million, to finance crucial voter drives in the race's last days.
Except for a few negative comments, including from one man who followed the Mayor's entourage while comparing him to a dictator, Mr. Giuliani encountered mostly well-wishers, like Bill Priest, 55, a registered Democrat who has lived on the Upper West Side almost all his life and works in publishing.
"I got to say good luck to you," said Mr. Priest, shaking the Mayor's hand. He said he will be voting for a Republican for the first time next week.
"He's done a very good job," Mr. Priest said. "He's not everybody's friend all the time. At times, people dislike him. But the whole picture -- he's done a fantastic job."
Also yesterday, Mr. Giuliani, in appearances in Bensonhurst and East New York, Brooklyn, played down his lead in the polls in an apparent effort to make sure that his supporters do not become complacent. Later, about 1,000 Hasidic men showed up in a cold rain to hear Mr. Giuliani talk for five minutes in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, showcasing his support in a community known to turn out at the polls in force.
The Messinger campaign suffered a setback yesterday when the editorial boards of The New York Times, The Daily News and Newsday endorsed the Mayor. The New York Post gives Mr. Giuliani the nod in today's editions.
"I think that it is very bad for the future of this city when relatively thoughtful people are willing to endorse a mayor who has not told them what he will do in his second term," Ms. Messinger said, "who has not promised to serve out his second term, and who has managed to pretend that the schools are fine because he dribbled a little bit of money back on them, that rising unemployment is a sign of economic health."

The Coming Food Gap
Problems like falling water tables and rising consumer demand could create huge food gaps in coming years in the world's poorest countries, a study found. The report, prepared by a Washington group, says that improved living standards and population growth are expected to put pressure on food stocks at a time when big increases in agricultural yields appear unlikely.

Budget Deficit Dips As Economy Strengthens
President Clinton will announce today that the Federal budget deficit has fallen to $22.6 billion, its lowest level in decades, largely as a result of strong economic growth that has created a surge in tax revenue, Administration officials said. The figure, covering the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, was within the range predicted by economists and Congressional analysts in recent weeks, and capped a year in which the economy drove the deficit downward at a stunning rate, even before the balanced budget agreement this summer by the White House and Congress took effect. A1
 
Gingrich Making a Comeback
Newt Gingrich, the field marshal of the Republican revolution, is once again out on the House floor. Instead of turning Republican leadership meetings over to subordinates, Mr. Gingrich is now running them himself. And since August, he has kept up a grueling national fund-raising and speaking tour -- all part of a concerted effort to strengthen his position as Speaker and reclaim his role as the intellectual leader of the fractious Republican Party. A18
 
Crack Cocaine and Violence
A Justice Department study has found that the most important reason for the sharp decline in homicide rates over the past five years may be the waning of the crack cocaine epidemic. The report acknowledges that improved police work, longer prison sentences and improved emergency medical care have also contributed to the lower homicide rate. A12
 
King's Son in Line for Post
Martin Luther King 3d has emerged as the most likely candidate to take over as the head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The conference's directors are expected to meet this week to vote on the appointment of the group's new leader, but the final decision will be made by conference delegates. Several members of the conference's board confirmed a report that Mr. King was the heir apparent to the civil rights group founded by his father, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and others.

M.T.A. Begins Process Of Automating Subways
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to buy a communications system that would allow computers, rather than people, to drive and dispatch the trains. The result for riders, the authority hopes, will be trains that run faster and more frequently, because the system will allow them to run closer together -- and at the same time, more safely, because human error that has been blamed for many crashes will be eliminated. B1
 
Toll System Expanding
The E-Z Pass system will be switched on at the toll plazas of the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels just after midnight. For the first time, commuters will be able to drive to and from the city by any route without having to dig for dollar bills, scrounge for coins or hold up traffic asking for a receipt. B1

The Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit are near agreements with Amtrak and its track workers union that would keep the commuter trains running even if there was an Amtrak strike on Wednesday. B2
 
Mayoral Candidate Forays
Mayor Giuliani began the last week of campaigning for the Nov. 4 election by making a foray into the heart of Ruth W. Messinger's base of support on the Upper West Side, where he was generally received warmly, even as he warned his supporters across the city not to grow overconfident of victory. Ms. Messinger, who is trailing Mr. Giuliani in the polls and with her campaign running low on money, asserted that the race was not over and she appealed for votes in appearances in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.

McGreevey's Education Ideas

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

DATELINE: EDISON

 BODY:
Detailing how he would spend much of his time if he were elected governor, James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate, said that his focus would be on public education, economic development and carrying out a master plan for growth in the state. In an interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times's printing plant in Edison, Mr. McGreevey offered his most specific breakdown of what his priorities would be if he were to win the election on Nov. 4, and said that the state's schools would consume a great deal of his time.

HEADLINE: When (and Why) Dad Has the Babies

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
MANY working mothers will attest to this: When a woman does the laundry and cooking, she gets clean clothes and food on the table. When a man does the housework, he gets a standing ovation. A good mother is natural, a good father divine.
And so it is that the male sea horse has long been viewed with awe, as a kind of submarine saint. Not only does he look like a Gothic hallucination, with his horse's head, anteater's snout and spiraling dragon's tail; he also behaves like a fantasy. As scientists discovered many decades ago, the male sea horse is the one that becomes pregnant, carries the young in his belly and gives birth. He is such a flamboyant specimen of devotion, such an exemplary parent, that the female sea horse is easily forgotten. How does that deadbeat mom spend her time, anyway? 
 Doing most of the work, it turns out, but behind the scenes and without making a fuss. In results that shatter a staple of sea horse lore, Dr. Heather Masonjones of Amherst College in Massachusetts has determined that despite appearances, the female sea horse contributes more effort and energy to the welfare of her young than the male does, and that, therefore, sea horses are not quite the procreational iconoclasts they were assumed to be. Dr. Masonjones has found that although the male does carry the gestating embryos in a brood pouch, he does not transfer nourishment to them through a placenta-like organ, as had been thought; instead, the embryos feed off nutrients in the egg -- food they had received beforehand from their hard-working mother. Dad operates essentially like an incubator -- a great guy, yes, but not a martyr to his children.
Dr. Masonjones studies dwarf sea horses, one of about 35 species of the fish found worldwide, and though she suspects her findings are applicable to other types of sea horse, she has yet to prove it. Her new results are part of her recently completed doctoral dissertation and are now being submitted for publication. She presented some of the work at a recent meeting of the Animal Behavior Society at the University of Maryland.
In tandem with being less motherly than legend has it, male sea horses turn out to be less brotherly as well. Scientists had thought that given the considerable commitment of male sea horses to child care, sex roles would be swapped in toto, and the males would sit back peacefully while the females thrashed it out with one another over the right to mate with them. But as Dr. Amanda Vincent of McGill University in Montreal, and Dr. Masonjones have shown, some of the old verities of the animal kingdom apply: put a few females together with a male, and not much happens. Put two or more bachelor males in with a female, and the males go at it, interlocking their tails, extending their lower jaws and snouts, and jabbing at each other as they might at food. It is an odd, mannered, viscous performance, the Jets and the Sharks by way of molasses, but the surliness is clear. "You can hear them snapping at each other," Dr. Masonjones said. "It sounds like the snapping of fingers."
The latest insights into one of nature's most eccentric specimens demonstrate once again the danger of making simplistic, overarching assumptions about reproductive behavior and the ever-shifting dialectic between male and female. And though the results strip some of the sentimental gauze from the male's reputation, they enhance the sea horse's status as one of the most compelling and complex creatures, gilled or otherwise. Sea horses are fish, but they are not cold fish; they are great romantics. In a world where infidelity is almost universal, sea horses pair up and seem to be unerringly faithful to their mates, reaffirming their bond each day through elaborate courtship rituals. They are great pretenders, able to blend in with their surroundings so convincingly that they are nearly impossible to investigate. Dr. Vincent, considered the world's leading expert on sea horses, is one of the few people to study them in their native habitats, and even laboratory investigations of the creature are rare.
Sea horses may be too ethereal for their own good. Nobody knows how many sea horses swim the world's waters, and few countries bother regulating or tracking them. Dr. Vincent estimated that in the last five years, sea horse populations have plunged by 15 percent to 50 percent, depending on the species. The animals are harvested by the tens of thousands for use in traditional Chinese medicine, and demand for them has surged along with the boom in the Chinese economy. Sea horses are also gathered to supply the aquarium trade, although they fare poorly in captivity. They are sold as "curiosities," made into key rings, paperweights and mobiles. Their marine habitats are threatened by agricultural runoff, sewage, overfishing, boat traffic and a variety of other human activities.
"We need to put the brakes on now, before there's a catastrophic collapse," Dr. Vincent said. "You can't afford to lose 50 percent of a population in five years." She and a global network of activists and scientists are struggling to devise an amalgam of solutions to ease the pressure on sea horses. They are working to establish small-scale aquaculture programs in places like the Philippines and Vietnam, where the fish would be reared for trade rather than plundered from the wild; they are consulting with practitioners of Chinese medicine to learn how sea horse extracts are used, and what ingredients might serve as substitutes; and they are lobbying for the enactment of regulations to monitor and control the international trade in sea horses.
In September, the Australian Government responded by announcing that it would regard the family of fishes that includes sea horses, pipefishes and sea dragons as a form of wildlife. "They're the first marine fishes in Australia to be considered wildlife, rather than just food," Dr. Vincent said. "That means exports of them will be controlled and documented."
Sea horses may be poorly understood, but they have been known, and exploited, since antiquity. They are pictured on Greek vases, for they were thought to be the offspring of the stallions that carried the god Poseidon's chariot across the waves. The Roman naturalist Pliny wrote that ashes of sea horse could cure baldness, impotence and rashes. By the 18th century, scientists realized that sea horses are fish, though highly modified ones. Unlike most fish, they wear their bones on the outside, as an exoskeletal armor that offers considerable protection against predation. Their genus nomenclature, Hippocampus -- hippo meaning horse, and campus, worm -- was used to name the sea horse-shaped structure in the brain responsible for memory.
Sea horses range in size from half an inch to more than a foot in length, and they are found in coastal waters throughout the world, congregating in sea grasses, mangrove swamps and coral reefs. Like chameleons, sea horses can change color to match their surroundings, going from drab to psychedelic in a matter of moments, and they can even grow skin filaments to better mimic algae or coral. The camouflage is both defensive and offensive. Sea horses are ambush hunters, wrapping their tails around a strand of seaweed and waiting for a small crustacean or other live prey to swim by, at which point they lunge forward and suck the meal in through their trunk-like snouts.
In love, sea horses are thoroughbreds. Once they have chosen a partner, they have eyes for no other. A married sea horse of either sex cannot be persuaded to cheat on its mate even when presented with a tankful of willing singles. The pair reaffirm their bond each morning through a courtship ritual of quivering, tail-wrapping, and dancing round and round a blade of sea grass like figurines on a music box. The female roams farther afield than the male, ever on the lookout for better feeding grounds. She needs the calories to generate a clutch of eggs. And when her eggs are ripe, the tango begins. She approaches her mate and raises her head upward in a slow arc. He quivers in response. She nods more emphatically, and he nods in refrain. Facing each other swan-style, they entwine their tails and rise upward in the water. They disengage and do it again, 5, 10, 50 times, for hours and hours. "They're trying to line their bodies up perfectly," said Dr. Masonjones, "so the female can insert her ovipositer into the male's brood pouch."
Eventually, their bodies harmonize, and she transfers her eggs into his womb. As she does so, the male releases a burst of sperm from a cloacal opening above the pouch, fertilizing the eggs internally. Here Hippocampus stands alone. In many species of fish, males tend to the eggs and even brood live embryos in their mouths, but nowhere else in the animal kingdom is fertilization known to occur within the male's body. The eggs seeded, a sphincter muscle snaps the brood pouch shut, and a membranous seal forms behind it.
Throughout the 10 or 12 days of gestation, the fluid within the pouch is completely insulated from the external environment, its salinity and oxygen maintained at constant levels. Placenta-like epithelial tissue extends from the pouch lining to surround each embryo. That tissue was thought to permit the transfer of calories from the father's bloodstream to the young, but Dr. Masonjones has concluded that the placenta serves mainly as a waste-removal and gas-exchange system.
Her experiments with dwarf sea horses, which are about two inches long, show that all the protein, fats and carbohydrates needed to feed the infants are derived from the meat of the mother's eggs. The role of the brood pouch, she says, is to act as a safe and predictable haven, a shelter from the fickle seas, so that the young need not devote egg energy to regulating salt and oxygen concentrations, but instead can spend it all on getting bigger faster. "At this point, it doesn't look like there are many energetic costs of brooding to the male," Dr. Masonjones said.
Once the two dozen or so fry are sufficiently baked, the father goes into labor, which can last up to two days. Eventually the seal is broken, the pouch reopens, and a stream of fully developed, but very tiny, sea horses comes trotting out. Now they are on their own and must begin hunting immediately. Most die of starvation.
There is no respite for the parents either. While the father was brooding, the mother was feasting, and making a new batch of rich, yolky eggs. The day after the male gives birth, his mate returns with the new clutch of ova to be fertilized and incubated. Throughout the seven-month breeding period, the male sea horse may become pregnant a dozen times, giving birth to more than 300 young.
It is because the partners must be in perfect procreative synchrony, the mother ready with new eggs at exactly the moment when the father's pouch is open for business, that infidelity, nature's favorite ploy, becomes almost impossible. There is nothing to do but stay true, and start each morning with a twirl through the grass.

Chart/Drawings: "Male and Pregnant"
The sea horse has long been a favorite of feminists because, almost unique among animals, it is the male of the species who gives birth to the young. Now researchers who study the elusive creatures have discovered their method of reproduction may actually be in the male's best interest: because females do not have to bear the young, they can produce more eggs for the male to fertilize.
In mating, the female expels eggs into the male's pouch, where they are fertilized. The bright red eggs impart a glow to the male's pouch.
The dwarf Sea horses shown here, Hippocampus Zostrae, can reach 2 inches in length, and other species can grow to 14 inches.
Sea horses have elborate courtship rituals. Here, they entwine their tails and "promenade" through the water.
After 10 days the babies emerge from the male's pouch. They grow to adulthood in about three months.

HEADLINE: Male Chromosome Is Not a Genetic Wasteland, After All

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
WHY the Y chromosome? The question can now be answered, after the discovery of almost all of its genes and the emergence of a pattern that explains how the Y chromosome evolved.
The new findings may also help toward understanding the sources of male infertility, the cause of half the childlessness that affects some 10 percent of American couples. Defects on the Y chromosome affect only men, who have an X and Y chromosome in each cell of their bodies, while women have two X's. 
 Chromosomes, visible under the microscope as puffy X-shaped blobs, are nature's answer to the hard disk drive: they are high-density genetic storage devices organized along random access principles. The 70,000 human genes are packed into 23 pairs of chromosomes but are distributed, as far as anyone can tell, with no rhyme or reason as to which chromosome a gene is assigned to.
The one exception is the Y chromosome, which has very few genes on its main body, apart from the male-determining gene that switches the fetus away from the default human condition of femaleness.
It is strange that this bastion of maleness should be a wasteland, genetically speaking. Until recently, only eight genes had been found on it, compared with the several thousand packed into each of the other 45 chromosomes, including the Y's counterpart, the X chromosome.
Believing there must be something more in this desolate genetic terrain, two biologists at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., Dr. Bruce T. Lahn and Dr. David C. Page, made a thorough search of the Y chromosome and have now turned up 12 more genes. That makes 20 known genes on the main body of the Y, which they believe is close to the full inventory.
Knowing roughly what these genes do, the Whitehead scientists have been able to reconstruct the likely history of how the Y chromosome got to be the way it is. Their findings and theory are reported in the current issue of the journal Science.
In the beginning, when devising two sexes, nature needed to insure that the male-determining gene did not sneak into the female's genome or gene set. That is a tougher chaperoning problem than it may sound, because a principal way of creating genetic variety between generations is for pairs of chromosomes to line up and promiscuously trade fragments of genetic material before creating egg and sperm cells. This wholesale shuffling of the genetic deck is called recombination and is a principal reason that children differ from their parents.
To confine the male-determining gene to the male line, the chromosome containing it started not to recombine with its counterpart, except at the very tips, where it has the same few genes as the X chromosome.
But recombination is the genome's tonic for healthy living and all-round fitness. Genes that do not recombine eventually cease to provide useful service to an organism trying to survive in a changing environment. And useless genes tend to get lost. So the Y's decision not to recombine with the X meant that most of its genes became unfit and over the course of millions of years were driven into extinction. The Y has visibly shrunk to just a cut-down version of its sister chromosome.
The Whitehead biologists find that the 20 genes left on the Y fall into two classes. One class has counterpart genes on the X chromosome. Both the X and Y versions of these genes are switched on in many different tissues of the body and play housekeeping roles in the cell's economy. These nine genes are presumably the sole survivors of the Y chromosome's original full complement of genes.
The second class of Y genes are switched on just in the testis and are presumably involved in the manufacture of sperm. Dr. Page views them as male fitness genes, and has reason to believe that over the course of evolution they jumped onto the Y from other chromosomes.
One of these male fitness genes, which has been studied earlier in Dr. Page's laboratory, turns out to be missing in certain men who produce no sperm. The DAZ gene, as it is called (short for "deleted in azoospermia"), seems to be descended from a gene called DAZL (for "DAZ-like") which is found on chromosome No. 3. The DAZL gene, Dr. Page believes, must have copied itself onto the Y chromosome some 30 million to 40 million years ago, since only in old world monkeys, and not in animals that split away earlier from the primate lineage, is DAZ found on the Y chromosome.
The other testis-specific genes probably also hitchhiked their way onto the Y chromosome, Dr. Page suggests. Although the chromosome offers an unstable and hostile environment for most genes, it is evidently a sanctuary for male fitness genes. Once they have landed on the Y, these genes produce extra copies of themselves. DAZ, like the other 10 Y genes of its class, exists as a family of multiple copies. The reason for the amplification is unknown.
The two classes, housekeeping and male fitness genes, account for all the known genes on the main body of the Y chromosome and thus explain the one part of the genome where gene content seems to have a rational basis.
"It's a lovely piece of work," said Dr. Huntington F. Willard, an expert on the X chromosome at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "This is the first glimpse we have had that the human genome was thrown together with some forethought."
Dr. Page, who has been studying the Y chromosome for 15 years, described the diminutive chromosome as "a part of the genome I have cared deeply about for some time" and said it was "exciting to find a little pocket of the genome that makes some sense."
Besides male infertility, Dr. Page's findings are also relevant to Turner's syndrome, a condition in women who have only one X chromosome. In normal women, with two X's in each cell, one X chromosome's genes are permanently switched off so as to give women the same dose of X-based genes as men. Dr. Page has found that there is an exception to this rule: the X-based genes that are the counterparts to the housekeeping genes of the Y. The housekeeping genes remain switched on in both X's so as to equal the male cell's dose from its X and Y chromosomes.
This suggests, though it has yet to be proved, that the abnormalities seen in Turner's syndrome may arise because the single X chromosome produces only half the needed dose of the various housekeeping genes. The odd collection of symptoms found in Turner's syndrome -- short stature, webbing of the neck, infertility and a narrowing of the aorta -- may each be caused by insufficient quantities of a different gene. Once these genes are identified, it may be possible to devise drugs that make them more active.

Diagram of the Y chromosome shows its two classes of genes. The X-homologous genes (labelled black), so called because they have close counterparts on the X chromosome, are general housekeeping genes, switched on in many cells. The other class (gray), which includes the male-determining gene SRY, is switched on only in the testis. Third line shows result when given genes are deleted. (Source: Science)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Stocks' Free Fall Sends Dollar Down Sharply Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar had its biggest drop against the German mark in two and a half months yesterday and lost its early gains to end flat against the Japanese yen after the stock market's plunge.
The dollar dropped sharply against the mark in late afternoon trading after the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted more than 550 points for its biggest point loss ever, automatically shutting trading on stock markets in the United States. 
 The United States currency was higher against the yen during most of the session as traders sought the dollar as a safe haven from weak Asian currencies, but it lost all its gains after Wall Street's free fall.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7495 marks, down from 1.7730 late Friday, its sharpest drop since mid-August. The dollar was also trading at 121.88 yen, compared with 121.87 yen on Friday, after peaking at 122.29 earlier in the day.
The dollar also tumbled to a three-month low versus the British pound after Britain reiterated that it would not join Europe's planned common currency in 1999. The pound was quoted at $1.6595, up from $1.6335; it was its highest level since late July.
The dollar did rise sharply versus the Mexican peso as financial worries about emerging markets spilled into Latin America. The dollar hit an intraday high of 8.6500 pesos, its strongest since the peso's devaluation in December 1994, which preceded a deep economic slump in Mexico. The dollar settled at 8.4000 pesos, up from 7.8700 late Friday.
Tim Stewart, a global currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover, said he expected currency traders to move cautiously until stock markets begin to stabilize.
"Most people have had a pretty good year in the currency markets," he said. "It's not a period in the next few weeks to be brave."
While the dollar is often viewed as a haven for investors during times of financial turmoil, many investors yesterday turned to the mark and the Swiss franc. The mark rose strongly against the yen, which also contributed to the dollar's decline against the German currency.
The dollar also dropped sharply against the Swiss currency, to 1.4499, down from 1.4706 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Next Asian 'Domino' Won't Be China

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Financial turmoil in Southeast Asia has surely tainted the Asian economic miracle. Yet there is no reason to expect that all Asian countries will meet the same fate. Gregory Fossedal (Op-Ed, Oct. 24) says China may be the "biggest devaluation domino of all" because its currency is overvalued. But he fails to recognize fundamental differences between China and those Southeast Asian countries. 
 First, most Southeast Asian countries suffered huge trade deficits as a result of currency overvaluation. The Chinese currency is not overvalued. The current exchange rate is 8.28 yuan to the dollar. If purchasing-power parity is used, the exchange rate would be about 1.7 yuan to the dollar. China has enjoyed a trade surplus for the past three years, evidence that its currency is not overvalued and its exports are not "becoming less competitive."
Second, most Southeast Asian countries (except Singapore) have relatively meager foreign exchange reserves. But China has a reserve of $132 billion, the second highest in the world next to Japan.
Third, although China incurred foreign debt of $110 billion, 80 percent of this is long-term debt that need not be paid back in the short term. And most of its loans from the World Bank are for the improvement of infrastructure, not for "luxury" projects.
Finally, the Chinese inflation rate has fallen precipitously since last year, allowing China's central bank to lower interest rates. These factors suggest that China will avoid the domino effect. A stable currency and a steadily growing economy will facilitate China's economic and political reform.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Set Record in September

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes inched higher by two-tenths of a percent in September, setting a record, the National Association of Realtors said today. The gains came entirely in the Northeast.
Existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.32 million units, up from a revised 4.31 million in August. It was the highest level since the trade group began tracking sales in 1968. Most economists had expected a drop of about 1.2 percent. 
 Strong economic growth and plentiful jobs are giving Americans the wherewithal to buy homes, and mortgage rates are near the low point for the year. The Department of Housing and Urban Development said last week that the nation's home ownership rate rose to a record 66 percent in the July-September quarter.
The median price of an existing home -- meaning half sold for more and half for less -- was $125,600 in September, up 6.6 percent from last year.
By region, sales jumped 11.7 percent in the Northeast, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000. They were unchanged in the South at 1.64 million. They fell 2.8 percent in the Midwest, to 1.09 million, and dropped 4.1 percent in the West, to 940,000.

HEADLINE: HORSE SHOW;
Gem Twist, U.S. Star, To Take His Final Bows

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
Because he hated his heels to touch the fences he was bred to scale, he gained a reputation as a perfectionist who did not suffer human fools lightly, no small feat for a mere horse.
But Gem Twist, the New Jersey-born Pegasus who will experience the ultimate equine retirement bash this week during the National Horse Show's four-day stint starting tomorrow at Madison Square Garden, was no mere horse. He was a patriot, the pride and joy of the United States Equestrian Team, which had labored for years under the stigma that European horses were superior to homegrown. When his owner, Michael Golden, once pondered a foreign nation's seven-figure offer for Gem Twist, a veteran American rider informed him he had better plan on relocating to that nation, too, if he ever had the gall to export this horse. 
 Gem Twist, an Olympic medalist, a tenacious 10-year veteran of the international Grand Prix circuit, and a riveting peacock in the show ring, where he amassed more money, and more honors, than any of his contemporaries, became a legend in his town with his ability to fly without wings. And his owner's, trainer's and riders' lives were touched and changed (painfully on occasion) by the 18-year-old champion who will, unknown to him, take his final public bows Saturday afternoon at the Garden.
"People used to tell me he was the horse of a lifetime," said Greg Best, the Flemington, N.J., native who won everything from 1987's rookie of the year title to two Olympic silver medals aboard Gem Twist until he splintered his shoulder in a career-stopping fall at Devon, Pa., in 1992.
"But now I realize he was the horse of a hundred, thousand lifetimes," he said. "Gem gave me a vehicle for launching a career; the phase of my life that was spent with him exceeds comparison." Best, 33, is traveling from Waipuckurau, New Zealand, where he runs his own horse business, to celebrate Gem Twist's career. "It's going to be emotional, for sure, to be there at the Garden with him for the last time. He was always the hometown boy there, and I was the hometown boy who got to go along for the ride."
The silvery gelding won 40 major events, accumulated more than $800,000 in prize money, attracted purchase offers of $2.5 million, and is the only superstar to win the American Grandprix Association's horse of the year award three times. Gem Twist is also the only jumper to claim the A.G.A.'s championship for three different riders: Best in 1987, Leslie Burr Howard in 1993, and Laura Chapot, the daughter of Gem Twist's original owner and lifelong trainer, Frank Chapot, in 1995.
Not bad for an aloof, mottled gray gelding purchased as an unproven 3-year-old with great bloodlines but no guarantees for future greatness by an astute businessman and very amateur horseman, Golden, who got both more and less than he bargained for when he chose Icey Twist as his first horse. ("It sounds corny, but I changed his name because I had this gut feeling he was going to be my rare jewel, a Gem," Golden said.)
Since Golden, president of the Whippany, N.J.,-based Stephen Gould Corporation, had never bought a horse before, he had no inkling that he was getting the deal of the century on the horse of the century when he shelled out $12,000 for Gem Twist. Nor did Frank Chapot, the six-time Olympian whose favorite U.S.E.T. mount, Good Twist, was Gem's father, have any idea what he was giving up when he sold the rambunctious youngster to Golden.
"I wasn't enough of a genius to see what kind of future he was going to have; if I'd known, I would have charged $2 million," said Chapot, whose Chado Farm in Neshianic Station, N.J., will serve as Gem Twist's retirement home after serving as his headquarters throughout his career.
Once Golden took possession of Gem Twist and began riding him under the watchful eye of his instructor, Arlene Orr, it did not take long to realize the horse was simply too much horse for the owner. "Let's just say that whenever we went into the arena, everybody else automatically cleared the ring," said Golden.
Golden and Gem Twist parted company, at least as a jumping team, the day his steed tackled a two-foot-high combination jump in the schooling ring as if it were a six-foot monolith on the Grand Prix circuit. Golden was already dangling from the saddle when the horse decided to take off straight toward a parked tractor, and in the instant that he envisioned himself as a broken-limbed hood ornament, Golden bailed out. For good. Gem Twist went back to Chapot for further training, and when Chapot decided the horse's radical jumping style was having the same effect on his back as a trip to a bad chiropractor, Greg Best, then a Penn economics major with a weekend minor in exercising jumpers, got the call that changed his life.
"It was one of those rides where Frank just told me to get up there and see if I could stay on," said Best, who wound up staying aboard for six years. "He was a creative horse, and charismatic in his own way: he seemed to like to get himself into awkward situations and then figure a way out of them." Best and Gem Twist made the definitive Grand Prix debut in 1987: the 8-year-old jumper took horse of the year honors and the rider was the rookie of the year. A silver medal at the Pan American Games followed, and then the rookie duo surprised the horse world by dashing through a jumpoff to a silver medal for show jumping at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, where the United States also collected a team silver. It was in Seoul where Gem Twist unveiled the crowd-pleasing post-leap bucking that, along with his determination never to touch a jump, became a signature.
After Best's unfortunate tumble in September 1992, Leslie Burr Howard replaced him as Gem Twist's rider, and though it took the new pairing 18 months to win a Grand Prix, the veteran rider kept Gem Twist safe enough in the 1992 standings to secure his third horse of the year title.
"He was such a smart, clever horse, and though he seemed ordinary in the schooling area, when he went in the ring, puffed himself up, grew two hands taller," Howard said. "It was like an actor going onto the stage."
The improved teamwork of Gem Twist and Howard in 1993 yielded that year's A.G.A. Championship, and when Chapot, still Gem Twist's trainer, looked for a horse to take his daughter, Laura, through her Grand Prix initiation season in 1995, he put her aboard the most reliable mount he could find. Gem Twist, older and wiser and snowy white at 16, not only carried another newcomer to rookie of the year honors, but also won the A.G.A. championship, a repeat of his double coup with Best in 1987. The horse had, as his owner puts it, "come full circle. Frank was the first person to ever ride Gem, and now Laura will be the last."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Down to the sea in marketing: three big new campaigns for the cruise line industry.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
CRUISE line advertising is still a long way from reaching saturation levels, but it has been growing steadily for several years and shows every sign of continuing to set records.
Early this month, for example, the Cruise Lines Industry Association, a trade group, began an $8 million yearlong campaign called "You haven't lived until you cruise." Norwegian Cruise Lines recently rolled out an ad campaign primarily aimed at travel agents that will cost nearly $1 million this quarter. (It will follow up with a national consumer ad campaign in January.) And Royal Caribbean International is spending $5 million for sole sponsorship of the halftime show during the Super Bowl, to be held in San Diego on Jan. 25. 
 The Royal Caribbean ads will be aimed in large part at extolling the pleasures of cruising on any of Royal Caribbean's 12 ships or on any of the 5 ships of Celebrity Cruises, which Royal Caribbean acquired last summer.
"The challenge is to be seen as a global provider of vacation options, not just these two little cruise lines in Miami," said Mark Kammerer, director of marketing for Royal Caribbean. "Next year, our joint revenues will exceed $1.5 billion."
The ads for Royal Caribbean are being created by McKinney & Silver, a unit of the CKS Group in Raleigh, N.C. Celebrity is handled by Harris Drury Cohen, an agency in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that is also working on the Cruise Lines Industry Association campaign.
Discounting concerns that the price it paid for the Super Bowl sponsorship is akin to putting all of Royal Caribbean's advertising eggs in one basket, Art Sbarsky, Celebrity's senior vice president of marketing, said that at least 85 percent of the millions who watch the halftime show on television have never gone on a cruise.
Expanding on Mr. Kammerer's theme, Mr. Sbarsky said: "If we were just a cruise line, our sponsorship wouldn't make economic sense. But we're a huge vacation company." Seeing a backdrop of Super Bowl spectators basking in the San Diego sun in midwinter, he said, is likely to make those millions of television viewers think about vacations. If the ads do their job, that will translate into cruise vacations with Royal Caribbean or Celebrity.
Sponsorship of the San Diego Super Bowl provides another benefit to Royal Caribbean. "The following year the Super Bowl will be played in Miami, our backyard, " Mr. Kammerer said, "and we have the option for that halftime show.'
The previous campaign for Norwegian Cruise Lines -- "It's different out here" -- created by the Omnicom Group's Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, won awards from the advertising industry. But the ads raised eyebrows in the cruise industry for their sensual imagery, and drew criticism from Bob Dickinson, the president of Carnival Cruises, the industry giant. Ads that emphasize glamour rather than value, he said, "send messages that 'I need a $50,000 wardrobe' or that 'I need my breasts augmented or my teeth capped' to go on this cruise line or that."
Norwegian's new ads take a much different tack.
Created by Young & Rubicam Chicago, which won the account three months ago, the ads in the trade press are intended both to build the Norwegian Cruise Line brand and to differentiate it from other cruise lines and land-based vacations. Its general theme, the "Norwegian Way," highlights the tradition of Norwegian seafaring excellence.
Thus one ad, with an Old World globe adorned by wooden Viking ships, asks: "O.K., so Norwegians discovered all the world's sea routes. But what have they done for you lately?" The facing page says: "New routes. New ports. New itineraries."
Another ad shows a partly opened can of sardines on one page, dancing and dining passengers on the other page. "Ask any Norwegian," the headline says. "It's not the size of the vessel. It's the space per passenger."
A plaque depicted in another ad, obviously aimed at the spate of megaships that cruise lines have added recently, describes the Norwegian Way thus: "We believe a ship should be a ship, not a floating mall. Authentic, romantic, civilized. Long on choices, not on lines."
It should be noted, however, that the cruise line's Norway, at 1,035 feet, remains the longest cruise ship afloat. But Nina Cohen, vice president of marketing for Norwegian Cruise Lines, said what other Norway loyalists maintain -- that the classic lines and generous amounts of wood used in construction of the ship (which was built in 1960 as the S.S. France) give it an unexpected intimacy.
Beyond that, she noted that while the company has been Norwegian since it began, "The Norwegianness has never been used as a raison d'etre."
"In fact," she continued, "we called ourselves N.C.L. Now we're breaking out." The company is doing so not just in its ads, but by changing the name of three ships: the Seaward, to Norwegian Sea; Dreamward, to Norwegian Dream, and Windward, to Norwegian Wind.
"The ads are whimsical, tongue in cheek and relevant," Ms. Cohen added. "How can you not love them?"

HEADLINE: Christmas Fades As Retail's Rescuer;
Stores Look to Rest of Year As December Sales Flatten

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
For weeks, retail executives have been making grand predictions about the imminent holiday. It is going to be smashing, they say, citing all the new toys, themed baby clothes, home decorations and eager shoppers dying to buy it all.
The holiday they are speaking so fondly about is not Christmas, though, but Halloween. 
 When the subject turns to the December selling season, traditionally a shopping blowout, everyone is less chatty. This Christmas will be decent, retail experts agree, but probably not fantastic.
It is no coincidence that retailers are keeping expectations low for the Christmas season, even when all the consumer surveys and economic indicators suggest that Americans have plenty of money to spend for the holidays. That is because Christmas is slowly shedding its role as the annual rescuer of American retailers, the sure-thing season that makes up for a year's worth of mistakes.
Indeed, sales of general merchandise, apparel and furniture in November and December fell to 23.9 percent of annual sales in 1996 from 25.4 percent in 1988, Commerce Department figures show. That adds up to a huge $9.5 billion that shifted away from the holiday season or evaporated altogether. This is anathema in the retail business, where the holiday season has long been counted on to cover a multitude of shortcomings.
The one sector of the retail industry that has enjoyed better trends -- luxury goods -- may also hit a speed bump this Christmas if days like yesterday, when the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 554.26 points, continue. An embattled yen and serious trouble on the Hong Kong stock market have resulted in declining sales of expensive shoes, handbags and liquors by Japanese tourists. And the people who have profited mightily from gains in the stock market here may not be running so quickly to Neiman Marcus and Tiffany this season.
To be sure, the holiday-season quarter remains essential for shopping malls and traditional retailers -- representing up to 40 percent of annual sales for some merchants and nearly half of the annual profits for most retailers. But just as they have watched more competition enter their market over the last decade, now they are also watching several other industries lap up shoppers' dollars, even at Christmas.
"People just don't spend money on Christmas the way they once did," said Peter N. Schaeffer, a retail analyst at Dillon Read. "It all goes back to Americans working more hours and harder than ever before and spending money differently. They are making the abode more comfortable. They are buying sport utility vehicles. And if I spend $200 on my kid's hockey equipment, I am going to buy him less at Christmas. It's that simple."
As sales of items like clothing have flattened, sales of airline tickets, restaurant meals and services have risen, appealing to overtaxed consumers who prefer the quick thrill of a nice meal or a pleasurable vacation to another shirt, compact disk or tie.
"It hit me on one Christmas Eve when I was standing in Nordstrom and I thought, 'This is nuts,' " said Katy Khakpour, a receptionist who lives in Seattle. "I'm spending Christmas Eve racing around trying to find last-minute gifts, and this is not what this celebration is supposed to be."
For the last few years, Ms. Khakpour and her sister and mother have opted not to shop the day after Thanksgiving, traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year, treating themselves instead to high tea at the Four Seasons Hotel. And they have stopped exchanging gifts. "We know as adults that if we need anything throughout the year, we can get it," she said.
As a result of these trends, traditional retailers and mall developers have had to work harder to make the rest of the year count more. Retailers as varied as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the Zale Corporation and the Dayton Hudson Corporation have looked to marginal holidays like Halloween and Mother's Day for new selling opportunities. Others have tried hard to build customer loyalty with packages similar to airline mileage programs that they hope will translate into added sales year round. For example, frequent shoppers can join a club at Neiman Marcus and with multiple purchases can earn points for later discounts or perks like lunches with celebrities.
"Retailers are up against the same situation that supermarkets are in," said Therese Byrne, editor of Retail Maxims, a newsletter on retail issues, who has studied seasonal selling cycles for two years. "You need people in the stores at least once a week."
So where are the dollars going that once flowed to traditional retailers?
One area of the economy that appears to have taken market share from retailers is travel. Passenger revenue on domestic airlines has increased nearly 29 percent since 1990, according to the Air Transport Association of America, and hotel occupancy rates have hit record highs over the last year. Dozens of luxury resorts sold out for the holiday season months ago.
Often, families may choose to go on a trip rather than buy a dozen presents. "I spend much more time getting away," said Amy Wells, 22, an insurance company receptionist in Portsmouth, N.H. "Travel is the biggest and best gift of all."
Some retail sales also appear to be shifting to restaurants. Inflation-adjusted sales in American restaurants grew to $320 billion last year from $200 billion in 1987, fueled by the success of chain restaurants like the Outback Steakhouse, the Olive Garden and the Cheesecake Factory -- places that appeal to children as well as adults and offer reasonably good food, served fast.
The urge to get away from it all -- whether it is a week in St. Barts or two hours at the Olive Garden -- underscores the shifting needs of the American family, where time-pressed dual-income parents are looking for ways to relax.
Retail experts said that gift certificates for services like day spas or tuitions for ballet school or camp -- areas that are hard to measure in dollar terms -- were now often given as gifts. What is more, savings for college and investments for the future have also pulled at the nation's longest purse strings: those of baby boomers.
"For baby boomers," Ms. Byrne said, "everything they have has to be the best, and that extends to their kids. That doesn't mean they are going to buy them things. It is ultimately about getting them into activities and preparing them for the future."
"People are into experiences," she added. "The last thing they need is the aggravation of a mall."
That seemed to ring true for Ellen Cooper Klyce, who lives in Memphis and has three school-age children. "I'm trying to simplify and not have so much stuff in my life," Ms. Klyce said.
"In our family, we also give promises in a coupon book redeemable by the end of the next year," she said. "So I may give a coupon book with promises not to nag, or to give an encouraging word or to buy an ice cream sundae."
The smartest retailers have attuned themselves to the shifting values and spending habits of Americans and have worked to get them into stores the rest of the year.
Consider Zales Jewelers. Not so long ago, aside from selling engagement rings, jewelers had only Christmas to look forward to. With less traffic in malls at Christmas, though, Zales began aggressively pursuing shoppers during other holidays.
"We are here to do business all year round," said Robert J. DiNicola, Zale's chief executive. While the retailer may once have simply hoped for the best on Mother's Day, it now devotes 20 to 25 percent of its second-quarter marketing budget to the holiday.
It has a similar strategy for Valentine's Day, using advertising, signs outside the store and pure salesmanship to convince people that a bracelet or watch is a year-round gift. "We want our associates to drag them into the stores," he said.
As a result, 78 percent of the company's profits now come in the fourth quarter, down from 95 percent a few years ago. The company expects fourth-quarter profits to represent 60 percent of the entire year within the next few years.
Zales is not the only one trying to convince Americans that there is more to celebrate than Christmas. Discount and department stores have become obsessed with Halloween. This year, stores like Wal-Mart and Target devoted large sections of their stores to displaying everything from home decorations to adult costumes to bibs that say "My first Halloween."
"Halloween is now a very major sales event," said Douglas A. Scovanner, chief financial officer at Dayton Hudson. "Same-store sales last year at Target in October increased 9 percent, due in no small part to Halloween."
Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said he expected Dayton Hudson's fourth-quarter earnings to represent 45 percent of the year's total, compared with 54 percent last year.
Even at Toys "R" Us, the mother of all holiday retailers, efforts have been made in recent years to beef up the rest of the year.
"The holiday season is getting a little less of the overall holiday business," said Michael Goldstein, the chief executive of Toys "R" Us. The company recently put a 52-page advertising insert in Sunday newspapers, trying to drum up early business. "Six years ago, we never would have done that," he said. The company has also added gift registries to try to make the store a destination for new mothers and parents shopping for a child's birthday party. Such things "help us through the rest of the year," he said.
Mall developers have even joined in the game. Seven of the country's largest developers now offer a Visa card that consumers can use to shop in 500 malls nationwide and receive 2 percent rebates on every purchase, said Adrienne Davis-Brody, senior vice president for marketing at the Wells Park Group, a developer. Shoppers who get the card also get benefits like free parking, gift wrapping and the use of a photocopy or fax machine in the mall.
Even retailers who still make more than 80 percent of their sales during the holidays are faced with a stronger need to lift profits the rest of the year through greater control over expenses, reduced inventory levels or clever programs that give incentives to shoppers in the middle of July.
"If you are not making your profit line the first three quarters," said Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of the National Retail Federation, "you are running a great risk during the fourth quarter to make your overall goal. Ten years ago, you stood a greater chance of doing so. You can't take your eye off the business at any point in the year these days, because if you do, you are heading for a real problem."

GRAPHIC: Graphs: "Retailers Are Selling Less at Year-End . . . " tracks November and December sales as a percentage of the year's total, for department and discount stores and retailers of apparel, furniture, appliances or miscellaneous goods like cards and gifts. Graph runs from 1987 through 1996.
 
" . . . And Consumers Are Spending Elsewhere" compares spending on several categories as a percentage of annual household consumption on most goods and services other than contributions, personal insurance and pensions. Figures are shown for '72-'72 and '94-'95. (Sources: Commerce Department; Bureau of Labor Statistics)(pg. D1)
 
"More Like Other Seasons"
Many retailers still depend on peak sales volumes at holiday time, especially in nondurable goods categories like jewelry and apparel. But November and December's contribution to total sales each year has been shrinking over the past decade in most categories.
Graph shows the change in the two months' share of total annual sales in several categories from 1987 to 1996, in percentage points. For example, bookstores rang up 23.49 percent of 1987 sales in November and December, but only 20.79 percent of 1996 sales in those months, a decline of 2.70 percentage points.

HEADLINE: The Plunging Dow

 BODY:
There are three salient facts to keep in mind before sizing up yesterday's scary 554-point drop of the Dow Jones industrial stock average. Its drop of 7 percent was much smaller than the 22 percent, 508-point drop on Oct. 19, 1987. The economy can absorb shocks better today than 10 years ago, because inflation is lower, employment is higher and, most important, banks are financially sturdier. The Federal Reserve Board, under its current chairman, Alan Greenspan, reacted correctly in 1987 to keep the economy rolling on an even keel, and will have to do so again today.
The 13 percent fall in the Dow from its August peak of around 8,200 should be put in perspective. Mr. Greenspan warned investors of "irrational exuberance" last December when the Dow was under 7,000. Now that it has dropped back down to about 7,160, it is still high -- relative to corporate earnings -- by historical standards and still above the levels that worried Mr. Greenspan late last year. What will happen when the stock and financial markets open today is anybody's guess. Millions of Americans have experienced only sunny days in the market, and it is difficult to predict how they will react to a severe downturn. 
 But there is reason to believe that a resilient economy and Federal Reserve intervention can prevent avalanche selling on Wall Street from burying jobs and income on Main Street. The "lost" wealth, measured from the Dow's peak, might lead some investors to cut back spending, but the Fed has the tools to offset that problem by nudging interest rates lower as needed. Stock crashes create problems for banks, securities firms and mutual funds that are hit by a rush of investors redeeming shares and demanding cash. But the Fed has the luxury of working with a banking system that is flush with reserves and the leeway to pump money into an economy that is almost inflation-free.
True, there is the worrisome image of Japan, where stock and real estate markets crashed, dragging the economy along with them for most of the 1990's. But Japan's banks were buried in bad loans, and its central bank reacted slowly and ineptly.
Last week's turmoil in Hong Kong and financial capitals in Southeast Asia probably frightened investors on Wall Street enough to spark self-fulfilling waves of selling. But Southeast Asia has a limited impact on the American economy, and if the American stock market had not been spooked by Hong Kong it would almost inevitably have been spooked by something else. There remains a danger that currency disruption and stock market crashes will spread from Asia to other regions, but such contagion, given that scared foreign investors will likely pour their money into the United States as a safe haven, ought to pose a limited danger here. The economy's vital signs are strong, which reflects many years of solid monetary and fiscal policies that should now serve Americans well.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET PLUNGE: THE IMPACT;
Consumers Likely to Keep On Spending Unless . . .

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Judging by the initial reaction, yesterday's 554-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, despite all the scary reminders of 1987, seems unlikely to have much impact on people's spending -- as long as stock prices do not plunge much further.
"I am assuming the market is going to revive on Tuesday," said Madeline Hochstein, president of DYG Inc., a public opinion polling firm. "Another 500-point drop over the next couple of days, and you enter a different ball game. People would start pulling back on their spending." 
 Her views, repeated in a dozen interviews with economists and pollsters, demonstrated a vast change over the last decade in the prism through which Americans -- at least the 40 percent of the population holding stocks -- view reversals in the market.
In 1987, many people saw the October crash as their worst fears come true, a repeat of what had happened to their parents in October 1929, and the Depression it soon ushered in. The selloff this month, in contrast, draws comparisons not with 1929, but 1987. That crash was damaging -- real estate prices fell, for example, and Wall Street firms went through huge cutbacks. But there was no immediate recession, and stocks soon embarked on the long bull market that has lasted until now.
"The 1987 experience taught people, rather traumatically, that things can go wrong," Ms. Hochstein said. "Now we have been through 10 years of learning that things can go wrong; you can have a recession, you can be downsized, and still you can survive, even quite nicely."
The stock market's spectacular rise this year -- the Dow average was up 28.1 percent from January to its peak in August -- has clearly had a "wealth effect," many economists say, contributing to the nation's strong economic growth mainly through spending on luxury cars, travel, home remodeling, sales of appliances and computers, and investment in new machinery.
Yesterday's market shock did not seem sufficient to shake that spending, in part because interest rates have fallen even as the Dow industrials declined 11.2 percent over the last four trading days, including yesterday's 7.18 percent drop.
"One offsets the other," said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. The 30-year mortgage rate, now down to 7.3 percent from 8.2 percent last April, is likely to drop to 7 percent shortly, Mr. Seiders said, based on what has occurred in the last few days. "At this point, I am not much worried," he added, "as long as stock prices don't fall much further."
The rule of thumb among economists for measuring the effect on spending of a stock market selloff is this: For every dollar that an investor loses in portfolio value, he or she spends three cents less over the next year or two.
Chris Varvares of Macroeconomic Advisers Inc. in St. Louis calculates that stock prices are down roughly 15 percent since August, shrinking stock wealth by $1.6 trillion. "At three cents to the dollar, that comes to roughly $50 billion in spending cutbacks over the next two years," he said -- only a small fraction of the nation's income over that period.
Still, the selloff over the last four trading days is worrisome to Henry Kaufman, an economist and money manager, in a way the 1987 crash never was. While the Dow has lost only 11.2 percent -- half the drop on the day of the crash in 1987 -- the American stock market is responding to global turmoil beyond its control. The 1987 crash initiated the turmoil that brought down stock prices elsewhere in the world, but a decade later the Dow is plunging in response to the Asian financial crisis.
"We have little historical precedent to guide us in this situation," Mr. Kaufman said. "The problem is in the Far East, not here. That is new for Americans, and much of what happens next in the United States could depend on what happens next in Japan. That country has not had a stock market rally at all this year, and further deterioration in response to the Southeast Asia turmoil could spread fresh trouble to the United States."
Not surprisingly, after the market shut down yesterday, many Wall Street analysts tried to put the best light on what had happened. Mr. Kaufman, for example, noted that rising stock prices had added more than $5 trillion to household wealth since 1995, and very little of that has been lost, so far.
Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, offered similar comfort. "When you wake up on Tuesday," he said, "you have to think that if you put $1,000 into stock at the end of 1994, you still have $2,000 left."
And then, whistling past the graveyard perhaps, Mr. Roach said: "Remember, in 1987, the worst meltdown we had ever seen since the Depression, turned out to be the greatest buying opportunity in our lifetime."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Thrive as a Haven From Stocks

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Supported by a flight to safety from plunging stocks around the world and the first trading halt on Wall Street since the 1987 crash, Treasury securities surged yesterday and pushed yields down to 20-month lows.
The rout in stock prices overshadowed factors that in other circumstances might have caused bond prices to fall. 
 Potentially strong economic data due this week -- including information on consumer confidence, the quarterly employment-cost index, home sales and third-quarter economic growth -- coupled with a fresh supply of Treasury debt had been expected to put pressure on bond prices.
But yesterday the main focus in all the financial markets suddenly became falling stocks and a 554.25-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, which caused trading to halt in American stock markets.
"The stock market got a reality check," said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities, in Boca Raton, Fla. "Normally, the fixed-income market does not focus on equities. But when you least expect it to happen to the market that can hurt the most people at one time, that's when it happens."
Investors and traders pouring money into the safe haven of Treasury bonds helped the benchmark 30-year issue rally 126/32 to a price of 1036/32 . Its yield, which falls when prices rise, declined to 6.14 percent from 6.27 percent on Friday -- the lowest yield since 6.09 percent on Feb. 14, 1996.
Traders said that the 30-year bond got a big lift late in the afternoon, after a 350-point decline in the Dow average led to the first-ever use of a half-hour trading halt, one of the "circuit breaker" mechanisms devised in the aftermath of the 1987 crash to limit market volatility.
On reopening, the Dow average quickly fell another 200 points, which led to the declaration of an hourlong halt that ended the session because only a half-hour of trading remained.
"When the stock market reopened, the bond raced up two points before tapering off a bit," said Jack Ablin, executive vice president and head of fixed income at Barnett Capital Advisors. He said the reason bonds tapered off reflected the impact of the second circuit breaker, which meant "no other money could leave" on the stock market.
This week the Government will be selling $26 billion of new two- and five-year notes. Such Treasury auctions by themselves can cause prices to drop by raising the prospect of a supply glut. But the surge in demand for Treasuries from fund managers and foreign investors seeking the safety of United States debt securities diminished that possibility.
In when-issued trading ahead of today's two-year note auction, the securities were offered at a price to yield 5.55 percent, down from 5.75 percent on Friday. Tomorrow's five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.69 percent, down from 5.90 percent on Friday.
Traders said yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills went well, as the short end of the Treasury market benefited the most from the selloff in stocks. The discount rate for a three-month bill was 4.97 percent, up a hundredth of a percentage point from last week; the rate for a six-month bill was 5.08 percent, down from 5.15 percent.
Despite the bond rally, traders had mixed views on what the stock market turmoil could signify for bonds in coming weeks and months.
Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said the flight to safety from Asia would help the bond market for a while. "Eventually, however, the Asian countries will need cash to defend their currencies and shore up weakened balance sheets," he said. "U.S. securities will be sold and interest rates will be higher than otherwise would be the case."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: In Miami, a Romance, However Brief, With the Marlins

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The home of the new World Series champions woke up today giddy from celebrations that did not even begin until the early morning hours, its euphoria tempered neither by the workday nor the uncertainty over the possible sale of its winning team.
Nowhere in South Florida was the Marlins' 11th-inning victory over the Cleveland Indians early Monday sweeter than in the city of Homestead, which built a $12 million spring training stadium for the Indians for the 1993 season, only to be abandoned by the team after Hurricane Andrew devastated the city in 1992. The Indians, citing "an act of God," got out of a two-year contract and went on to train in Winter Haven in Central Florida, while the Homestead stadium was repaired but has yet to attract a tenant. 
 "We got a double victory out of this -- we got to see the Marlins win, and we got to see the Indians lose," Mayor Tad DeMilly of Homestead said today.
After the destruction caused by Hurricane Andrew, Mayor DeMilly said, "for these guys to come in and kick us in the shins created a long-lasting negative impression." He added, "I don't care if they'd played Little Leaguers, we would have supported the Little Leaguers."
Emotions seemed to run as deep elsewhere in South Florida, where thousands of fans poured out in the streets from sports bars and home parties shortly after midnight on Monday to dance on top of cars and honk horns, to yell "MAAARLINS!" until they were hoarse and to slap one another silly.
At Pro Player Stadium, where the Marlins gave South Florida its first professional sports championship since the Miami Dolphins won the Super Bowl in 1974, Eddie Russo, 27, remained in his seat for a half-hour after the game, letting the tears flow.
"With all the ebb and flow of the game, my body and mind just couldn't handle it anymore," said Mr. Russo, a resident of Parkland, a Fort Lauderdale suburb. "This is big."
In Coconut Grove in Miami, South Beach in Miami Beach and the Las Olas Boulevard area in Fort Lauderdale, fans wearing fish-shaped hats and Halloween masks protruded from windows and sun roofs in car caravans going nowhere as traffic jammed within minutes after the game. In the Little Havana section of Miami, revelers came with conga drums and pots and pans, creating an impromptu carnival.
Xavier Cortada, a 33-year-old painter, said he had not seen such spontaneous euphoria since 1980, when 125,000 Cuban refugees arrived at Florida's shores in the Mariel boatlift and Cubans here thought that the fall of Fidel Castro's Government was imminent.
Cuba has not changed politically, but it produced the World Series' most valuable player, Livan Hernandez, who defected in 1995 while traveling in Mexico with the island's national baseball team and is now the toast of both Cuba and Florida.
Paint on cars read "Go Fish" or, in one case, "Go Pescados." Debbie Cohen, 38, and Tom Murphy, 49, a married couple visiting from Long Island, were swept up in the frenzy after watching the game in a Coconut Grove restaurant.
"Everywhere you go in Florida, everybody is so psyched," said Ms. Cohen, a Yankees fan. "We had to root for the Marlins."
The Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Miami and Greater Fort Lauderdale estimated that the series generated more than $50 million in economic benefits for the local economy.
Parades are planned on Tuesday in both Miami and Fort Lauderdale. The Marlins will hold a rally in the evening at Pro Player Stadium.
But the nagging question of the future of the team hung over the festivities. The team's owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, announced in June that he would sell the Marlins, although he vowed to consider only investors who would keep the team in South Florida. He says the Marlins are losing $30 million a year and he has lobbied for a new publicly financed, more intimate stadium that would be only for baseball and would have a retractable dome.
The current stadium was built for the Miami Dolphins football team. While its size allowed about 67,000 fans to attend each World Series game there, many consider it too large for baseball.
Mr. Huizenga's spokesman, Stan Smith, said today that the owner had not changed his mind about selling. But in recent interviews, Mr. Huizenga has indicated that he is reconsidering. Early this morning, in the champagne-sprayed Marlins locker room, Mr. Huizenga shouted to anyone within earshot: "It doesn't get better than this, does it?"
Mayor Joe Carollo of Miami and his main opponent in the November election, Xavier Suarez, have both said they support public financing for a new stadium in Miami, although they disagree on a location.
But even some feverish Marlin fans were not enthusiastic today about the prospect of more public spending to insure the long-term future of the franchise.
"There are more important things for the public to pay, like education," said Jose Suarez, 43, an electrician from Miami. "How come a man with so much money can claim losses? He can pay for a stadium."
But today was no day for weighty issues. The mood was exemplified by Aldrin Gomez, 28, a jai alai announcer in Hialeah whose jeans dropped to his knees as he ran to an intersection in Little Havana with arms raised. In his underwear, surrounded by a throng laughing at him, he laughed along and pulled his pants up.
"Maybe I lost weight" watching the game, he said. Asked about the fate of the team, he said he would support a plan to finance a stadium with taxpayers' money but brushed off any more questions. "We're not worrying about that right now," he said, running off for another victory lap in drooping pants.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: SIDE TRIPS;
In Chinese Politics, Too, All Photo Ops Are Local

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
When President Nixon went to China in 1972, one of his main goals was to be photographed in the country's most illustrious settings: on the Great Wall, at the Forbidden City, even in Mao Zedong's private bedroom.
The same is true for Jiang Zemin, as he visits the United States this week. 
 Just as Mr. Nixon's overriding intention as a politician in 1972, an election year, was to enhance his prestige at home by basking in the exotica and stateliness of a China visit, Mr. Jiang's main purpose in coming to the United States is to look good back home in the year he is solidifying his position as China's foremost leader.
When asked, Chinese diplomats insist that Mr. Jiang's trip is intended to develop better relations with the United States in a quest to make the world a safer place. But in the reality of politics, domestic concerns come first, and for the Chinese that means promoting Mr. Jiang's image in the place he cares about most.
Chinese television audiences will doubtless be fed images of Mr. Jiang's visit for weeks and months to come. Well-known backdrops of Washington and New York are likely to appear stately, while hula dancers in Hawaii and the colonial dress of Williamsburg may look strange and mysterious to the Chinese.
But Mr. Jiang is not as much concerned about the impression he makes on the typical Chinese citizen as on members of the political and bureaucratic elite, whose allegiance and respect he needs to govern effectively. Chinese leaders are not elected by popular vote, but public opinion, hard as it can be to gauge, affects the elite and how they work.
In China, where centuries of tradition have made symbol and ritual far more important to politics than they are in the United States, images of the nation's leader on a foreign visit take on added significance.
For Mr. Jiang, there may be no more politically weighty photographs than those of him in America, meeting well-known figures and touring famous places.
"This trip is extremely important to Jiang," said Liu Junnian, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "America is still by far the most important country to China. Having meetings there is automatically significant, and it also makes Jiang look stronger by going there."
Indeed, Mr. Jiang's trip is probably more valuable politically to the Chinese side than to their American counterparts.
While each leader may have diplomatic objectives in the summit meeting on Wednesday, that is only one day of seven that Mr. Jiang is spending in the United States, and for the Chinese each day and each city offers some valuable images of America.
American negotiators preparing for the visit have said they were perplexed by the way their Chinese counterparts seemed extremely particular about the details of protocol and symbol that often seemed hard to understand. But Chinese negotiators are likely under pressure to please their superiors, who care most about how the trip looks back in China, not here.
The benchmark for Mr. Jiang's visit, without question, is the trip to America by Deng Xiaoping in 1979. That trip, while also freighted with heavy geopolitical significance -- China's plans to invade Vietnam and how the Soviet Union would react -- is best remembered in China for the way it certified Deng's emergence as China's foremost leader.
Deng's trip came just a month after he had consolidated his power at a key Central Committee meeting, endorsing a major advance in economic reform, then concentrated in farming. It also approved Deng's plan to open China to far more contact with the United States.
Yet Deng's goal, and his success, was to show Chinese viewers two things above all: that his leadership of China was unquestioned internationally and that he was as capable in foreign affairs as in domestic ones.
Similarly, this year's trip comes shortly after Mr. Jiang's own success at a Communist Party Congress, where he established himself as China's current leader. His trip is likewise intended to show that he is both firmly in charge of his nation and capable of conducting foreign affairs.
A complicating factor for Mr. Jiang is that the bureaucratic elite in Beijing whom he is most trying to impress will inevitably compare his trip with Deng's. And Deng's great success, winning over millions of Americans with a well-timed doffing of a cowboy hat, may be hard to top.
American negotiators urged Mr. Jiang to visit Chicago, to signify the growing trade and economic cooperation China has with the Midwest, particularly in climbing grain sales to China.
Yet the Chinese turned down that option, choosing instead to visit several sites of historical significance, from Pearl Harbor to colonial Williamsburg to Philadelphia and its Independence Hall.
"Chinese people have always respected American history," Mr. Jiang told reporters in Beijing. "I want to understand even more about America."
Mr. Jiang, an engineer who is China's first top leader to graduate from a university, apparently also wanted to draw attention to his taste for academia. Besides visiting a former professor in Philadelphia, he is also scheduled to visit Drexel University, his son's alma mater, and to deliver a major policy address at Harvard University.
Anticipating major demonstrations in Boston, American officials suggested choosing another city. But Mr. Jiang apparently was adamant that he wanted to speak at Harvard.
"He has his own personal political agenda," said Harry Harding, a China scholar at George Washington University. "This is a way of ratifying his position."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: PROTESTS;
Soapbox Is Crowded, And Lather Is Richer

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
A group calling itself Project Democracy in China had hoped to assemble Chinese dissidents in Lafayette Park across from the White House to protest the visit this week of China's President, Jiang Zemin. The problem was that so many people were applying at the park to protest the visit that the Parks Service had to turn the group away.
"There's an amazing breadth of opposition," said William Schroeder, a spokesman for the group, which now plans to hold daily protests in a corner of the Capitol grounds. "And they've all taken this occasion to come together in one place." 
 China has always had its enemies in the United States, from exiled dissidents to ideological warriors in search of a new Evil Empire.
But Mr. Jiang's visit has galvanized them like nothing since the Tiananmen Square massacre of democracy demonstrators in 1989.
Everywhere from college campuses to Congress, China's critics are a a growing group. They have disparate politics and concerns, with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. railing against prison labor, the Family Research Council against religious persecution, the Sierra Club against China's choking pollution. There are few issues in America today that unite the likes of Richard Gere and Oliver L. North.
All, with varying degrees of vehemence, oppose the Clinton Administration's policy of engaging China diplomatically and economically, especially in its emphasis on billion-dollar business deals.
"I think there's an increasing awareness of the broad spectrum of threat Communist China poses to the American workers, to our environment, to the human rights ideals this country has stood for for more than two centuries," said Mr. North, the former National Security Council aide involved in the Iran-contra affair, who is a talk-show host. "And I think it's been slow in coming."
Despite an admonishment from Mr. Jiang to keep unruly protesters under control and out of sight, the demonstrations are likely to punctuate the official proceedings, ruffling a visit that both Mr. Jiang and the Clinton Administration hope to use to smooth relations.
On Sunday nine protesters were arrested near the White House. A Chinese group plans to follow Mr. Jiang around the East Coast in minivans decorated to look like jails. Tibetans will converge at the Chinese Embassy on Tuesday and at a "stateless dinner" on Wednesday.
Today the Catholic Alliance, an offshoot of the Christian Coalition, held a vigil to focus attention on China's repression of religion. It was a small group, if spirited.
Chastising the President along with business executives, the Rev. Rob Schenck of the National Clergy Council prayed for help against companies "who choose to profit at the expense of those who lose the most sacred right of all."
While the Chinese remain adamant that the White House protect Mr. Jiang, the Administration itself may well be the focus of much anger.
As Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri, put it: "Betraying our country's heritage of leadership in defense of freedom and a stable international environment is not the way to establish a relationship with China." He was responding to the President's defense of "a pragmatic policy of engagement."
Today 11 Republican Senators, including Mr. Ashcroft, sent Mr. Clinton a letter opposing a tentative agreement that would clear the way for the sale of billions of dollars' worth of American nuclear power plants to China in exchange for its pledges not to export Chinese nuclear expertise.
Although that agreement is supposed to be a centerpiece of the visit, the Senators warned that "China has made and broken nonproliferation commitments for over a decade."
While Mr. Clinton promised as a candidate in 1992 not to coddle China's dictators, he later agreed to separate renewal of China's trade status from its record on human rights. Now that approach is entrenched in policy.
In Congress, Republicans have seen China as an issue on which to attack Mr. Clinton's stewardship of foreign policy. Critics of China and its policies have received an enormous boost from the religious right, which in recent years has rallied strong support on behalf of religious freedom, championing the cases of those jailed or persecuted for practicing their faith.
Few of China's critics call for cutting off relations, but most say the Administration must use its leverage to force Mr. Jiang to respect human rights. "This is the time to engage them," said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, "but to engage them with American values and moral principles."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: TRADE;
U.S. Business Ties to China Are Far Richer Than Any Diplomatic Links

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
Early this summer, the president of Intel Corporation, Craig Barrett, went to see the former mechanical engineer who now runs China, Jiang Zemin.
Behind the high walls of the Zhongnanhai compound, where China's leaders live, the two men talked for an hour about the power of the Pentium II, Intel's newest chip. 
 They talked about the potential of "Webcasting" -- or broadcasting via the World Wide Web. It was a technology that Mr. Jiang said he welcomed in China, somewhat to his guest's surprise, and Mr. Barrett said the talk left him with new insights about the pragmatic mind-set of the former factory engineers who are now in charge.
It was, in a way, a presummit summit meeting, and the fact that such talks have become more commonplace illustrates a central truth about the American-Chinese relationship: While the two Governments have kept each other at bay during most of the 1990's, the American business community has developed a web of relationships -- including some with the Chinese Government's top officials -- that is far richer and deeper than anything diplomacy has yet accomplished.
So this week, Mr. Jiang will be spending considerably more time with American businesses -- from I.B.M. to AT&T to Hughes and even the New York Stock Exchange -- than he will with President Clinton and official Washington.
As a result, one subtext of the summit conference that begins Wednesday is an effort to find a way for American foreign policy to catch up to the corporate foreign policies of Intel and Microsoft, Westinghouse and Boeing. "In many senses," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told American executives in Beijing last month, "you have invested in this relationship more fully than we have in Washington."
But much like Washington's interactions with Beijing, corporate America's have been a mix of success stories and daunting setbacks. To talk to American executives in China is to hear tales of executives in hot water for crossing swords with the wrong provincial governor while others were feted on yachts sailing through the Three Gorges. And here in Washington, companies with big stakes in China have often been on the opposite sides of major battles.
Just last year, Boeing pressed for permanent renewal of China's trading privileges at the same time that its neighboring corporate superpower, Microsoft, successfully pressed the Administration to threaten to impose $1 billion in sanctions against Chinese goods if Beijing failed to stop the piracy of software, videotapes and music. In that battle, Mr. Jiang backed down, finally convinced that a reputation for piracy could chill foreign investment.
With increasing frequency, American companies are in a tug of war with Beijing over its insistence that investments are tied to extensive transfers of technology -- often to develop industries that will compete with foreign firms. Chrysler backed out of a major car deal several years ago rather than turn over too much technology to Chinese automakers.
McDonnell Douglas, now part of Boeing, and its Chinese partners are being investigated by a grand jury in Washington in connection with the diversion of equipment for fabricating the skins of aircraft to a military site. (The diversion was detected and stopped before the equipment was put into use.)
American companies also must steer clear of the human-rights practices that often tar China's reputation in the United States -- for example, making sure not to use the products of prison labor and not to deal with subcontractors who do.
Such conflicts will go unmentioned during Mr. Jiang's visit. But even the U.S.-China Business Council, the chief lobbying group for smoother relations with Washington, notes that in the past two years Chinese leaders have tilted laws and new regulations "to the advantage of domestic firms" and to the disadvantage of foreigners.
So to the many crosscurrents of Wednesday's summit meeting, add one more: Just as the diplomatic relationship between Washington and Beijing is finally speeding up, the corporate relationship shows signs of chilling.
American investment in China actually declined last year by 7 percent, and the number of contracts signed -- the rough equivalent of looking at the numbers of shares traded on a stock exchange -- fell by 28 percent.
That reluctance to pour in more money will almost certainly be accentuated now that Hong Kong's stock market has taken a beating, and growth throughout Southeast Asia looks like it could be slow for several years.
"You are going to be hearing a lot of happy talk for the next few days," the chief executive of a major company doing extensive business in China said this weekend. "But the truth is that the same chief executives who will be toasting Jiang at the state dinner know enough about China that they will probably be cutting back their presence for a while."
If Washington and corporate America seem once again out of sync, the explanation may be that they are focused on two very different Chinas. Washington still focuses on managing China's interactions with the rest of the world -- as an arms proliferator, a potential threat to Taiwan, a growing diplomatic force in Asia. But the American business community is focused on China's internal changes -- the pace at which it privatizes its state-run enterprises and its willingness to lift the many restrictions that keep foreigners from competing directly for the hearts of Chinese consumers.
"The truth of the matter is that we still cannot sell directly to the Chinese people," Vaughn A. Koshkarian, who heads Ford's operations in China. Everywhere else in the world, Mr. Koshkarian notes, Ford keeps extensive records about who buys its cars. In China's case, it must sell to Government-affiliated distributors. Exasperated, Ford's executives in China once sent the company's interns out into the streets of Beijing for days at a time, recording the location of every Lincoln Town Car so that Ford could begin to communicate with the actual owners.
But the real lesson that American business brings back to Washington is this one: Government-to-government agreements are nice, but what works on the back streets of Shanghai and Xian is a conspicuous display of political power.
Procter & Gamble has flourished where other foreign consumer-product companies have failed, its competitors say with a mix of envy and anger, in part because its chief business partner in China happens to be one of Hong Kong's most powerful billionaires, a man with excellent connections in Beijing. During his tour of China, a diplomat told Mr. Rubin about a lawyer who had a remarkable string of victories in the Chinese courts, even in suits against local companies.
"I asked him, 'How do you do that?' " the diplomat said.
"He said it's easy: He just invites some very powerful people in Beijing to come sit in the front row."
But for all their complaints, American executives have found that the Chinese no longer reflexively react to every American call for change with a call for America to get its nose out of China's "internal affairs."
The dispute over piracy has resulted in the closing of more than 50 factories that were churning out counterfeit copies of "The Lion King" and Windows 95. .
Another sign that China is willing to listen to American economic suggestions -- as opposed to its advice about human rights -- came at the end of Mr. Rubin's trip to Beijing.
The Treasury Secretary told Zhu Rhonji, China's economic czar, that he was flattered by the fact that China keeps its $130 billion in foreign currency reserves in the form of Treasury bonds. But, Mr. Rubin asked, should not some of that money be spent on new power plants and other essentials that could ease China's industrial transition?
It might seem like a conversation between financial policy wonks, but something else was at work. "A few years ago the Chinese probably would have told us that this was their business, not ours," one of Mr. Rubin's aides said later. "Instead, they said, 'Could we run over those numbers again?' "

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: SCHOOLS;
Schools Under Giuliani: Raging at System, Then Nurturing It

SERIES: RACE FOR CITY HALL: The incumbent's record.

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
When it comes to New York City's public schools, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's term can be divided into two parts.
During his first three years in office, the Mayor railed against the girth of the Board of Education's central administration, pared $1.3 billion from the board's projected spending, and branded the board's decision to squirrel away $100 million in a reserve fund an "absolute tragedy." 
 Then, over the past year or so, Mr. Giuliani has permitted the Schools Chancellor to create $100,000-a-year jobs for a half-dozen new aides, added more than $200 million worth of programs to the schools' budget, and hailed the board's retention of a $156 million surplus as "good management."
What accounts for the difference?
The Mayor says the answer is simple: Since October 1995, he has had, in Rudy Crew, a Chancellor whom he can trust to spend the city's money wisely. He did not feel the same about Dr. Crew's independent predecessor, Ramon C. Cortines, whom Mr. Giuliani berated, on an almost daily basis, until he announced his resignation in the spring of 1995.
"This is a partnership based on shared principles," Mr. Giuliani said in an interview last week. "Rudy Crew is getting it done."
But critics fear that Mr. Giuliani's recent nod to the system's enormous needs -- he added money for reading instruction, textbooks, art teachers and computers this year -- is motivated as much by election-year politics as by a desire to help improve a troubled system.
And as evidence, they point to the most significant education initiative of the Mayor's first 32 months in office: a plan to transfer more than 1,000 public-school children to parochial and other private schools.
It was, the Mayor acknowledged then, hardly a vote of confidence in public education in New York. And that sentiment, even if the Mayor does not give voice to it these days, still concerns parents and teachers.
"I think he is really at the beginning of putting his mark on the school system, in any positive way," said Sandra Feldman, the president of the city's teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, which has not endorsed a mayoral candidate this year. "What will be his education legacy is yet to be determined."
So far, his major accomplishments have been political. Last year, the Mayor reluctantly set aside his demand that the Board of Education be dissolved and that he be given direct control of the school system. His turnabout -- whether motivated by his confidence in Dr. Crew, as the Mayor contended, or by the lukewarm support in Albany for mayoral control, as his critics suggested -- helped pave the way for the passage of a sweeping new law.
The law stripped hiring powers from the city's 32 community school boards, many of them seen as bastions of corruption, patronage and ineffectiveness. Those powers were transferred to the district superintendents who now report directly to the Chancellor.
"I played a card that I had developed, which is, I compromised," Mr. Giuliani said. "So I was able to play that card and get for him the power that I always thought should belong ultimately in a mayor."
The roots of that compromise can be traced to October 1995, when Mr. Giuliani ended his two-year feud with the independent Board of Education (the Mayor appoints only two of its seven members) by agreeing to support Dr. Crew, a compromise candidate, as the next Chancellor.
Since then, the Mayor's hold on the charismatic Chancellor and the board majority has been so firm and steady that Dr. Crew has been perceived as his Chancellor. The Mayor devoted an entire campaign advertisement to encouraging parents to "thank another Rudy."
Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia University, said that supporting Dr. Crew was "the Mayor's biggest accomplishment."
 The rapport between Dr. Crew and the Mayor stands in stark contrast to the sniping that dominated the relationship between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Cortines. Once a week, Dr. Crew meets with the Mayor, seeking his counsel on every significant decision.
Dr. Crew's loyalty to the Mayor is so strong that the Chancellor declined, in an interview, to characterize the budget cuts that preceded his arrival as harmful to the system -- even though schools had to gut programs in art, music, physical education, guidance and after-school sports.
Thus far, the Mayor has not used his heightened political control of the system to effect much change. By most yardsticks, the system looks much as it did at the end of the term of Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The city's portion of per-pupil spending, having been slashed by 11 percent during the first two years of the Giuliani administration, has increased this year to about the same level -- when adjusted for inflation -- as it was when Mr. Giuliani took office: about $3,400 per student, according to the Independent Budget Office, a city unit that provides nonpartisan budget data to elected officials and the public.
Mr. Giuliani boasts of creating seats for 80,011 students during his administration, half of them in trailers, but that is only slightly higher than the number of students who entered the growing system over that period. The system, in a debt inherited from the Koch and Dinkins administrations, still has 87,000 more students than its classrooms were built to accommodate.
Then there is the central administration.
Under Mr. Giuliani's persistent prodding, Mr. Cortines contended that he had winnowed nearly 2,000 full- and part-time jobs from the board's central headquarters, reducing its ranks from 5,630 in February 1994 to 3,738 in June 1995 through layoffs and attrition.
But that was not enough to satisfy Mr. Giuliani. In an interview in March 1996, six months after Dr. Crew's arrival, the Mayor called on the Chancellor to pare another 2,000 jobs from the central administration.
So far, Dr. Crew has come up short. A spokeswoman for the Chancellor, Karen Crowe, said he had eliminated 243 full- and part-time administrative positions, mostly through attrition. Dr. Crew has also created more than a half-dozen new high-ranking jobs, including one overseeing a special district for failing schools, three in the division of instruction, one to oversee parent relations and two in public relations.
Mr. Giuliani lodged no protest.
The Mayor, like the Chancellor, has taken some credit for a rise in students' scores on reading tests administered last spring. But the upward trend is a fledgling one. On a state test last spring, 69 percent of third graders were found to be reading at or above the state minimum standard, the first increase since Mr. Giuliani became Mayor.
On a city test in April, 49.3 percent of third graders were found to be reading at or above their grade level -- an increase of 2.6 percentage points over the previous spring. But because it was only the second year those tests were given, long-term comparisons are impossible.
Despite the rise in scores, parents' displeasure persists. In a New York Times poll released last week, 76 percent of respondents said they were not satisfied with the quality of the city's public schools. And in two celebrated instances last month, parent groups, using the threat of a lawsuit, prevailed on the system to add an extra teacher to their elementary schools because they thought class sizes were too large.
But parents' qualms about the public schools do not appear to have had much impact on Mr. Giuliani's strong political standing, in part, perhaps, because over the past year the Mayor has introduced a flurry of education initiatives.
He gave elementary schools $125 million to add reading teachers, reading workbooks and after-school reading tutorials. He spent $22 million to provide new computers and printers to intermediate schools. And he gave the system about $55 million, about $50 per pupil, to begin replacing textbooks, many of which dated from the Kennedy Administration.
Roscoe C. Brown Jr., the former president of Bronx Community College and an informal adviser to Mr. Dinkins on education, said he was reluctant to give Mr. Giuliani credit for restoring money "in the context of the fairly Draconian cuts that occurred before."
"If you give it back more recently than you took it away," Dr. Brown said, "then it appears a positive outcome."
Given that the reading program, among others, has been financed only for this year, the depth of Mr. Giuliani's new commitment to the system will be gauged by whether he continues to invest in it.
"Four years has not been a lot of time to turn this ship around," said Seymour C. Fliegel, a senior fellow at the Center for Educational Innovation, a conservative policy group that advises the Mayor on education.
"I give him the benefit of the doubt," Mr. Fliegel said. "Let's see what happens in the next four years."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET PLUNGE: THE POLICY MAKERS;
Washington Tries to Reassure Investors After Plunge: A Muted Response Is Coordinated by Officials

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration sought today to reassure investors after the stock market's plunge, but shied away from addressing the challenges that economic policy makers will face if the market decline continues.
And just as he did a decade ago on Oct. 19, 1987 -- the day the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points -- Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the official in Washington with the greatest potential influence on the markets, remained silent. But attention turned to whether Mr. Greenspan, who had been hinting recently that interest rates might have to rise to help contain any threat of higher inflation, instead might be driven to reduce rates to reassure investors. 
 A spokesman for the central bank said Mr. Greenspan, who is scheduled to testify to Congress on Wednesday, had been busy monitoring the situation, but declined to provide any details.
"Clearly, he no longer has to worry about 'irrational exuberance,' " said Ed Yardeni, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, citing Mr. Greenspan's comment last year about the possibility that the market had become overheated. "Now he needs to calm some irrational hysteria. I think he will do just that by suggesting that the Fed may lower interest rates if necessary."
The market plunge today, of 7.2 percent in the Dow Jones industrial average, was far more moderate than in 1987, when the Dow fell 22.6 percent on a single day. Unlike the 1987 crash, this drop did not leave financial firms scrambling to cover debts. But Mr. Greenspan, analysts said, will face a major challenge if the market continues to fall on Tuesday. Further sharp declines in stock prices would create increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to repeat the statement it made the morning after the market crash in 1987, when it reassured investors by promising to inject money into the financial system to avert the risks of cascading defaults among brokerage houses and banks.
But any move to loosen monetary policy would push interest rates down at a time when the central bank has been worried about a potential outbreak of inflation and has been leaning, instead, toward raising short-term rates. A crucial indicator that may provide a clue to inflationary pressures, the employment cost index, is to be released Tuesday.
Whatever the indicator shows, Mr. Greenspan, analysts said, will have to balance the short-term need to help stabilize the markets against the potential long-term risk of overstimulating the economy.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin sought to reassure the public. He said the nation's fundamental economic situation remained strong, and he and other officials said there appeared to have been no big problems on Wall Street that might have set off alarm bells about the financial system's basic ability to handle a market decline. "Our consultations indicate that the payment and settlement systems and other market mechanisms are working effectively," Mr. Rubin said.
Another part of the calculation facing American officials tonight was whether to revisit their arms-length approach to the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, where the run on the markets began.
When the International Monetary Fund bailed out Thailand this summer, with a $17.2 billion aid package, the United States was part of the discussions but not a contributor of cash. The thinking in the Administration at the time was that the financial crisis was a regional problem that should be first addressed by Japan and other major economic powers in the Asia, just as the United States took the lead when Mexico collapsed.
But Clinton Administration officials have gradually been rethinking that strategy as the crisis has deepened and resonated around the world. Over the weekend, Mr. Rubin suggested that the United States might take a more active role, through the I.M.F. and other international institutions. Others in the Administration have said internally that the United States needed to make a significant contribution to the Asian bailouts to reassure investors in the region.
Now all those decisions must be made in a different context: Stopping the cycle of selloffs that began in Asia and then circled the globe.
Mr. Greenspan and other policy makers in Washington have long been concerned about the possibility of a plunge in the market and its possible effects on the United States economy and in other markets around the world. Mr. Greenspan issued his latest warning about the sustainability of the bull market less than three weeks ago.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan's view of the Fed's role in a financial crisis was forged during the 1987 market crash. Mr. Greenspan had then been leading the Fed for just 10 weeks, and won wide praise for his public commitment to provide whatever liquidity the financial system needed.
But Mr. Greenspan has been careful to avoid drawing exact parallels between the situation then and current economic conditions. Moreover, the Fed chairman noted in one speech, that while there was not any large-scale, lasting disruption to the economy after the market fell in 1987, no one can be sure in today's circumstances just how much consumers and businesses might alter their behavior in the event of a sustained market downturn.
The muted response in Washington to today's plunge on Wall Street was coordinated through a working group of senior officials including Mr. Rubin; Mr. Greenspan; Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Brooksley Born, the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and other regulators and economic policy advisers.
Mr. Rubin briefed President Clinton on the market activity during the afternoon, White House officials said. Paradoxically, the market began plunging in earnest even as Mr. Clinton was delivering a speech in which he announced that the Federal budget deficit had fallen to $22.6 billion in the year ended Sept. 30, its lowest level since the early 1970's.
Indeed, in many ways, the juxtaposition of Mr. Clinton's announcement about the deficit and the market selloff served to emphasize the differences between today's economy and the conditions prevailing when the market fell off a cliff in 1987.
Not only has the budget deficit been tamed, but interest rates are far lower than they were 10 years ago and have been heading lower. Inflation has so far remained dormant, despite low unemployment and steady growth. While the Fed had been raising interest rates prior to the 1987 crash, the central bank this year, while wary that inflation could again take root, has remained on the sidelines since a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds target rate, to 5.5 percent, in March.
"The risks of problems in one part of the world spreading to others does make life more complicated," said L. Douglas Lee, the chief economist in Washington of the HSBC Corporation. "But you always have to return to the fundamental economic situation, and in the U.S. our economy is fundamentally quite healthy."

HEADLINE: Billing Problem Leads to Losses For Big H.M.O.

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Oxford Health Plans, the big New York area health plan that has been invoked as an industry model for its ability to keep costs down while satisfying patients, said yesterday that it had been losing money because it fell behind in sending bills to customers and underestimated how much it owed doctors and hospitals.
Because of the problems, the company faced the choice of whether to raise premiums more than expected -- perhaps angering the corporate customers with which it contracts -- or to take a big writeoff. 
 It chose the latter, deciding against any changes that would affect plan members. But the move startled investors, and they jettisoned their holdings of its stock yesterday.
The shares of Oxford fell $42.875, or 62.4 percent, to $25.875, in Nasdaq trading, making its stock the biggest decliner on a day when stocks in general plunged by about 7 percent. The market value of Oxford, whose 49 million shares traded made it by far the day's most active issue, plummeted by more than $3 billion, ending the day at slightly more than $2 billion.
Oxford's announcement was only the latest in a string of disastrous financial reports in the managed health care industry, as Aetna, Cigna and other companies said that higher costs would reduce their profits, too. Some economists have begun to question whether, over the longer term, health maintenance organizations can deliver on their promise of keeping health costs under control.
"Oxford joined the long list of H.M.O.'s that lost control over costs," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Oxford said it would report a loss of 83 cents to 88 cents a share for the third quarter, in contrast to analyst forecasts for earnings of 47 cents a share, according to I.B.E.S. International.
Much of the loss will be caused by a charge against earnings of $47 million to $53 million to increase reserves, as revenue for the quarter comes in an estimated $111 million less than expected.
Stephen F. Wiggins, chairman of Oxford, said that the company had belatedly discovered that many customers were not paying premiums, often because the company was late in sending bills during eight months from September 1996 to last May. Customers balked when Oxford tried to collect the back payments.
Oxford acknowledged earlier this year that it had fallen behind by hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to hospitals and doctors as it struggled with a new computer system that was intended to help it handle a rapid expansion. With incomplete information in its computers, it had to advance money to doctors and hospitals without verifying that they were obeying Oxford's cost-saving rules.
Oxford, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., is the biggest health maintenance organization in the New York area, with 1.9 million members, up from 1.4 million in 1996.
While Oxford recruited 109,000 new members to its plans from July through September, that expansion slightly trailed company expectations. And some employers with Oxford plans refused to pay the late-arriving bills and dropped the company as an insurer for their workers.
Analysts said the rapid expansion of Oxford was a big reason for its troubles. "When you add 500,000 members a year, it's hard to keep up," Mr. Abramowitz said. He said that Oxford's main rivals in New York, the United Healthcare Corporation, Foundation Health Systems and Aetna, would be the biggest beneficiaries of the company's problems, possibly adding new members at a faster pace.
Compounding Oxford's difficulties was the very feature of its plans that had helped fuel their rapid growth. The plans' liberal rules, compared with other H.M.O.'s, permit many members to go to any doctor or hospital, if they pay more for the privilege. If they choose physicians who are not in Oxford's network, the H.M.O. has little control over how many tests and other services those doctors perform.
"Once you open up all kinds of choice, you've taken away one of the effective tools to control costs that a managed-care organization has," Dr. Henry Simmons, president of the National Coalition on Health Care, said.
Mr. Abramowitz said that while the H.M.O. business in general had grown more difficult, free-choice insurance like Oxford's "is even more difficult, and when you switch information systems, it's extra difficult."
"A company can only digest so much change at one time," he said.
Mr. Wiggins said that Oxford still would make incremental technology changes, but that most problems had been "cleaned up now." He said Oxford would add "about half a percent" to spending on administration next year in an effort to insure that there are no similar problems.
"The important thing," he added, "is we're the same company we were on Friday, except our market value has dropped by half. We still have a very strong enrollment. We are now in our fourth month of on-time billings."
One analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Oxford had a credibility problem because it had repeatedly said earlier this year that its problems had been solved. Still, if the company succeeds now in improving its customer services and in promptly paying doctors and hospitals, the worst could be over.
Analysts noted that most big H.M.O.'s have had problems recently. Aetna and Cigna said earlier this month that higher medical costs were cutting earnings. United Healthcare, Humana and Pacificare have also reported disappointing earnings in the last two years.
Some health care economists said those problems indicated that managed care might be losing its ability to keep costs contained. "The H.M.O. industry has lost a lot of clout," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University.
He said H.M.O.'s had greatly expanded their networks of doctors to attract members. "The wider the network, the less leverage the H.M.O. has over the individual doctor and hospital" to restrain expensive practices, Mr. Reinhardt said.
Dr. Simmons, of the health care coalition, said, "Managed care alone can't possibly fix the total problem of rising costs, falling insurance coverage and serious problems of quality of care."
The coalition, a group of 87 employers, unions, and religious and consumer organizations, published research last week that contended that the slowdown in health costs of recent years was only a temporary blip.
Oxford and other H.M.O.'s have already said that they will raise premiums by 4 percent for 1998.
Analysts, including many who had been enthusiastic supporters of Oxford, said that it would take time for the company to cure its ills. "This will clearly linger through the 1998 earnings results," said Roberta Walter, a health care analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.
Mr. Wiggins, Oxford's chairman, said that as the holder of about three million company shares, he was "the big loser" in the stock price slide. He said that recent stock sales by company insiders, including himself, were made to raise money for taxes on stock options they had to exercise.
"I know it will take a while to rebuild investor confidence," he added.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET PLUNGE: THE ASIAN CRISIS;
Hong Kong's Slide Goes Deeper

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Tuesday, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Hong Kong stocks plunged further today, with the benchmark Hang Seng index ending the morning trading session down 1,621.8 points, or 15.45 percent.
Following Monday's sharp drop on Wall Street, the Hong Kong market today fell more than 12 percent at the opening. Scarcely an hour later, the Hang Seng sank like a stone past 9,000, a level not seen since 1988 and what many market analysts had regarded as a psychological barrier. 
 As Hong Kong stocks plunged this morning, Tung Chee-hwa, the man chosen by Beijing to run Hong Kong under Chinese rule, called a crisis meeting of his Cabinet. Afterward, he appeared unconcerned about the plunge, telling reporters that "our fundamentals are strong, that is the most important thing."
The turmoil on Hong Kong's exchange was mirrored throughout Asia this morning, with markets from New Zealand to Tokyo, Manila to Singapore all sharply lower.
The selloffs were accelerated by the overnight plunge on Wall Street.
"Today's crash is the direct consequence of the U.S. market selloff," said John M. Mulcahy, a managing director at Indosuez W. I. Carr, a brokerage firm here.
But even as the market here plummeted, Mr. Mulcahy said that it was uncertain where the damage would end. "All is contingent on what happens on Wall Street overnight," he said, referring to trading later today in New York.
Across Hong Kong, crowds of people gathered in front of market monitors watching the devastation, most murmuring quietly to one another. Some, however, said that some of the stocks seemed cheap. "I'm feeling really good," said Fung Wan, a 66-year-old retired cabbie who was hanging out at the Nang Yang Commercial Bank in front of a market monitor. "I didn't buy when the prices were really high. I'm here to buy cheap stocks."
So far this month, the Hong Kong market has lost 30 percent of its value as institutional investors and small shareholders alike have fled the turmoil created by the Government's dogged defense of the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong's market collapse has deepened the spreading economic and currency crisis in Southeast Asia that was brought on by reckless public spending, declining exports and widespread corruption. And while Hong Kong suffers none of the economic maladies of its neighbors, it is the last in the group whose currency is bonded to the United States dollar.
Last week, convinced that the Hong Kong dollar was overvalued and could be brought down, speculators attacked the currency with a fury. But Hong Kong fought back with equal ferocity to maintain the rate of about 7.75 to 1 that it has fixed against the United States dollar. The moves raised overnight borrowing rates radically and, according to BZW Asia Ltd., required spending $8 billion last Wednesday and Friday to buy Hong Kong dollars.
In the face of this defense, Hong Kong stocks, many of them property companies that are adversely affected by climbing interest rates, went into free fall. They sank 10.4 percent on Thursday, their worst performance in eight years, before surging back by 6.9 percent on Friday as investors bet the worst was over. It was not.
But not all economists were as distressed as small investors who saw their holdings being savaged. "This is a necessary adjustment that Hong Kong has to go through," said Jan Lee, the chief economist of the economic research department of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. "We expect further higher rates."
Despite the plummeting stock market, the Hong Kong Government on Monday reiterated its vow to defend its currency. The hard-line stand has had the desired effect. Virtually no one here expects the link to be ruptured.

HEADLINE: Oklahoma Case Highlights How Economic Burden of Jury Duty Affects Panel's Makeup

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

DATELINE: DENVER, Oct. 27

 BODY:
An auto mechanic told Judge Richard P. Matsch of Federal District Court here that he did not think he could make ends meet if he was chosen to sit on the jury for the second Oklahoma City bombing trial.
Each juror, under a fee set by Congress and last adjusted in 1990, will be paid $5 an hour, or $200 a week. But day care alone for the man's two children costs $168 a week, he said. His employer will pay his salary for only four days of jury duty; the trial could last months. 
 "We know financial hardship is something that's involved in a lengthy trial," Judge Matsch told the man sympathetically, "and we're not making light of it at all."
Had the man, the judge asked, tried to negotiate with his employer? Yes, the man replied, but it was all up in the air. His parents would try to help him out.
"Good," the judge said. "We appreciate that."
The search for 12 jurors and 6 alternates to hear the trial of Terry L. Nichols is now in its fifth week and Larry A. Mackey, the lead prosecutor, said tonight that opening arguments would probably be next Monday. But as the selection has unfolded, it has offered a detailed look at an issue that has long concerned legal scholars and professionals: the financial burden of jury duty and its effect on the makeup of a jury that is asked to work for less than the Federal minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour.
"It's the single biggest impediment remaining to recruiting jurors from a cross section of the community," said Jeffrey Abramson, a visiting professor of government at Harvard University and the author of "We the Jury" (Basic Books, 1994).
Several people in the pool of potential jurors for the Nichols trial are retired; others said their employers would make up the difference between their salaries and their jury pay, which will rise to $50 a day if the trial lasts beyond a month. But some said their financial obligations would make it difficult to serve.
Judge Matsch excused a heavy-equipment operator who feared bankruptcy. He also excused a woman who makes her living cleaning houses while caring for her grandchildren and a daughter seriously ill with leukemia. But he urged others to do everything they could to serve.
"We don't put jury service out for volunteers or say that only the people who are retired or don't have a job or don't have anything better to do should serve on juries," he told one prospect. "Obviously, that would not serve the constitutional function of the jury, which is to have a cross section of the community."
Mr. Nichols, 42, is charged with murder and conspiracy in the bombing that killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. His co-defendant, Timothy J. McVeigh, was convicted on identical charges in June, in a trial that lasted 11 weeks. Mr. McVeigh has been sentenced to death.
To cope with the economic burden of a long trial, some prospective jurors here said that they could draw on their savings, move in with their parents or send their children to neighbors for day care. One woman, whose husband was forced by degenerative spine disease to retire without a pension, told the judge she holds down four part-time jobs: mending baseball uniforms, working as a seamstress for a sporting goods store, teaching reading and baby-sitting.
To serve on the jury, she said, she could quit the baby-sitting job, but "I would have to sew after I got off and I would, you know -- it would be putting in probably 18-hour days, 16-hour days." She said she thought the school system where she teaches would continue to pay her. If not, she said, she could use her sick leave.
"So it's doable?" the judge asked her. It was, she said.
The effort that the jurors here are being asked to make is unusual but not unique. The latest figures on the Federal Court system show that 108 criminal trials lasted more than 20 days in the year ending Sept. 30, 1996. Most of the 7,202 criminal trials in that year lasted one to three days.
This year's Congressional appropriation for the fees of Federal jurors, including those on grand juries, was $67 million. The appropriation for lawyers appointed to represent indigents was $325 million; the lawyers, including those serving Mr. Nichols, receive $125 an hour.
"Jurors don't have a lobby," said Seth Andersen, director of the Hunter Center for Judicial Selection at the American Judicature Society, a national nonprofit organization based in Chicago that has long advocated judicial reform.
"Juror pay in the Federal system and in each state system has to be set by statute," he added. "Who would lobby the legislature or lobby Congress to increase jury pay? No one really does it."
Jerome Shestack, president of the American Bar Association, said the organization advocated "reasonable compensation" for jurors, but "the standards are fairly vague."
Traditionally, jury service is seen as "a civic virtue," Mr. Shestack said.
The notion that pay is not important is "O.K. for one or three days," but not for several months, he said.
G. Marc Whitehead, a lawyer with the firm of McDermott, Will & Emery in Chicago, who heads the Jury Initiative Task Force at the American Bar Association, said the issue of pay was reducing diversity on juries because people of modest means could not afford to serve.
"How can you ask a divorced mother with three children at home, or an entrepreneur, to make this huge sacrifice on the part of society, without some reasonable measure of compensation?" Mr. Whitehead asked.
In state trials, jury pay is often even lower, and varies widely. California pays jurors $5 a day; Arizona pays $12. A campaign to improve a wide range of conditions for jurors in New York State, led by the state's Chief Judge, Judith S. Kaye, resulted in legislation that raised jury compensation from $15 a day to $27.50 this year and to $40 next year.
Yet in most jurisdictions, "the legislators just don't see it," said Tom Munsterman, director of the Center for Jury Studies of the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va. "Who speaks for the jurors? No one."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CANDIDATES;
In New Jersey, Rivals Stump At Schools And a Stable

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: ALDINE, N.J., Oct. 27

 BODY:
Slogging along the edge of a muddy pasture today, in cowboy boots and jeans, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman waved her baseball cap to cajole a stubborn herd of 88 Holstein cattle into their daily ritual of moving down the middle of the road and crossing over into their milking stables.
But herding the cattle in this Salem County town seemed a cinch compared with wooing recalcitrant undecided voters in southern New Jersey. The Governor herself stayed smack in the middle of the road -- making an appeal to moderate voters on the Howard Stern radio program in the morning and touching on conservative themes about personal responsibility to Gloucester County high school students in the afternoon. 
 The Governor's Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey, addressed a group of Union County high school students on the subject of race, and attended an afternoon rally in Trenton with two dozen Democratic mayors, who joined him to criticize the Governor for the continued rise in property taxes.
Mr. McGreevey, who has repeatedly assailed Mrs. Whitman for borrowing $2.75 billion to balance her budget and shore up the state's pension plan, asserted that the day's precipitous drop in the stock market had underscored the "precarious nature" of Mrs. Whitman's financial policy. "The Governor has held the taxpayers of the state of New Jersey ransom to the market," Mr. McGreevey said.
Although the state's investment in the stock market is a long-term proposition, Mrs. Whitman's fiscal policy and her moderate social positions have caused many in the right wing of her party to take a tepid view of her candidacy. In an attempt to excite her party's base, the Governor campaigned with Terry Branstad, the Governor of Iowa.
"I think the conservative wing of the party will be relieved and feel a lot better when they see people like Terry Branstad, who's a conservative," said Lyn Nofziger, a consultant to Mrs. Whitman. Mr. Nofziger said that other more conservative Republicans, like Jack Kemp and Dan Quayle, are expected to join Mrs. Whitman on the campaign trail.
At Paulsboro High School in Gloucester County, Mrs. Whitman alluded to news accounts of violence involving suburban teen-agers. "We have to have a discussion in this state about personal responsibility," she said. "Every time you make a decision, there are consequences."
Earlier in the morning, she spoke with Mr. Stern on the telephone, and her voice was hoarse because she is battling a cold. "It's very sexy," the typically provocative Mr. Stern said of the Governor's raspy voice. "It's husky. I like it."
And while the unpredictable radio announcer said he supported the Governor because she "didn't buckle under to the right wing of her party," Mrs. Whitman was careful not to let the radio interview move so far left that it might offend conservative voters. When Mr. Stern commended her for sticking to her support of abortion rights, she responded, "What I wish we could get the discussion on is how to keep young women from getting pregnant in the first place when they don't want the baby or can't take care of the baby."
Mr. McGreevey's proposal to reduce auto insurance premiums received a boost today when Ralph Nader, the noted consumer activist, compared it to a plan passed by California voters in 1988, which he said has saved drivers in that state billions of dollars.
At the same time, Mr. McGreevey released a television advertisement that accused Mrs. Whitman of being too close to auto insurance companies. The 30-second spot says Governor is "secretly" allowing an insurance company to raise its premiums in exchange for a donation to the Republican Party. Officials in the Whitman camp quickly dismissed the advertisement as false.
During the evening, Mr. McGreevey attended a fund-raiser in Bayonne, and was a featured speaker at a formal dinner at the new performing arts center in Newark.
Republican officials hope that Mrs. Whitman's focus in south New Jersey will result in a much stronger showing than she had four years ago, when Jim Florio, who was then Governor, dominated his native region. Jack Collins, the Speaker of the State Assembly, said that internal public opinion polls showed the Governor leading Mr. McGreevey in many southern election districts.
As she campaigned in Aldine, Mrs. Whitman was joined once again by the football legend Jim Brown, who at times attracted more attention than she did, as farmers hustled over to shake his hand, and boys crowded around for autographs.
As residents gathered around bales of hay serving as chairs, Mrs. Whitman discussed her agriculture and small-business initiatives, and spoke with reverence of the people who make their living as farmers. "You have my utmost respect," she said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET PLUNGE: THE STREET;
Horror and Pain, but Oddly, Some Relief

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Many emotions swept over Wall Street yesterday: horror, panic, pain. But for a lot of market gurus, the strongest feeling was of relief.
That may sound odd on a day when stocks fell farther and faster than they have in a decade, with the Dow Jones industrial average plunging a record 554.26 points. 
 But as traders and investors watched the lines on their computer screens head steadily south, one thought seems to have flashed across a lot of minds: It's about time.
Not that anyone was celebrating the losses that millions of Americans will see in their mutual funds and brokerage accounts, not even the pessimists who had been held up to public ridicule for being bearish. "Sure, the champagne bottle's open, but we have very mixed emotions about this," said James B. Stack, editor of Investech Market Analyst, a newsletter in Whitefish, Mont., that had been predicting the bull market's demise.
But even some optimists almost welcomed the market's setback, which clipped more than 7 percent off the Dow yesterday and left it down about 13 percent since August. "It's almost good to have it out of the way," said Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter. "It sort of relieves some of the pressure."
Of course, that assumes that yesterday's drop does not turn into a rout, as it did in 1987, when the Dow fell more than 20 percent in a single day. Whether that occurs has as much to do with investors in Detroit and Duluth and Denver as it does with the financial crisis in Malaysia and Thailand and Hong Kong.
For a decade, American investors have learned that every market retreat is an opportunity to buy, because stocks always seem to recover from their dips. And that is what has made some on Wall Street so nervous.
Why? Before yesterday, the stock market had completed its longest stretch ever without the sort of decline that Wall Street calls a correction, meaning a drop of 10 percent from a peak. In this case, that peak occurred Aug. 6; the rally that preceded it lasted seven years, or twice as long as the next best period in financial history, way back in the early 1960's.
Historically, such setbacks occurred every 18 months or so. So even while stocks soared on a strong economy, low inflation and great earnings, there has been an undercurrent of anxiety on the Street.
By many traditional measures -- compared with companies' earnings, or the value of their assets -- stock prices were extremely high. For example, the stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average have been trading for about 25 times their earnings; historically, that number is more like 16 times, according to data from the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
And companies were paying out extraordinarily meager sums to their shareholders in the form of dividends. These dividends amounted to just 1.7 percent of prices -- the dividend yield, in Wall Street's parlance. Historically, stocks have yielded an average of 3.7 percent.
But these high valuations have persisted for ages, and investors who bailed out because of them have been left in the dust. Indeed, some seers said that the market and the economy had entered a new age in which the old rules were null and void.
So part of the relief on Wall Street stems from the feeling that 300 years of financial history has not been overturned. "Valuations do matter in the end," said William E. Rhodes, a vice president for investment strategy at Merrill Lynch. "You always hear, 'It's different this time,' and the situation is different -- but that doesn't mean the rules change."
Some on Wall Street were also worried about less concrete, more anecdotal evidence that stocks had moved too far, too fast: the wave of corporate takeovers paid for with stock, which seemed more attractive than cold cash; the rise of mutual fund managers as media stars; stories about people taking out second mortgages to gamble in the market, and, of course, stock tips offered by everyone from New York taxi drivers to Montana fishing guides.
Of course, the catalyst for the sharp drop yesterday was not valuations or economic fundamentals, but plunging markets in Southeast Asia. These markets have been in trouble for weeks, but until recently -- and particularly until Hong Kong cracked -- American investors pretty much ignored the possibility that what happened overseas could have implications at home.
To many market seers, those implications have now been absorbed, and then some, by investors. "I can't believe the fortunes of D.L.J. are too grossly affected by Hong Kong, but the stock is down 10 percent," said Laszlo Birinyi, a market strategist in Greenwich, Conn., referring to the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
"Financial crises actually tend to be good times to buy," he added.
Moreover, there are those on Wall Street who see a silver lining, although a costly one, in yesterday's plunge. "Some people have been buying stocks because they believe stocks never go down," said Roger Ibbotson, chairman of Ibbotson Associates, which analyzes long-term returns. "The occasional shake-out teaches a lesson too many people have been forgetting."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET PLUNGE: THE INVESTORS;
For Many Market Players, Panic Is for the Other Guy

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
When the great bull market began to teeter yesterday, Esther Curtis was out shopping for groceries.
Ms. Curtis, who is retired and lives in Columbus, Ohio, is an avid investor but not a frightened one. She remembers Oct. 19, 1987, and that strengthened her resolve to ignore any wild swings.
"I'm just holding tight here," Ms. Curtis said in a telephone interview. "I've been in it long enough not to panic. The economy's doing well and the companies are doing well, so I just have the faith." 
 Ms. Curtis is not alone. Traders and investors may well be worried that one of the mightiest bull markets of all time could be stumbling, but while mutual fund companies did say there were some redemptions, almost no one actually admitted feeling panic.
Indeed, the resilience of individual investors, who have rushed into the market since the 1987 market crash, has buoyed stocks repeatedly when there have been dips. Over the last dozen years, Americans have doubled the percentage of household financial assets invested in stocks, pouring money into employers' 401(k) plans and mutual funds in an effort to insure their futures. Wall Street has benefited heavily from the trend, and that may have tempered reactions yesterday at the exchanges.
"It wasn't that bad," said Steve Simmons, a floor trader at the New York Stock Exchange. "The only time it got a little edgy was when it was down 500. All in all, people are kind of laughing it off. It's been a fantastic year. It's kind of like we got in today, got beat by the better team, but tomorrow is another day."
Outside the exchange, a curious crowd had gathered. Harold and Nicola Schlicht, honeymooners from Germany, were on a boat to Ellis Island when the public address system suggested that tourists head for Wall Street. "They said it could be an interesting spot to go today," Mr. Schlicht said. "They said it might be historic." The Schlichts got to Wall Street, though, only to find that the market had closed early. "We're going to go back tomorrow," he said. "And we'll have to line up."
Many pros were unfazed by the plunge. "It was long overdue," said Blane Barbour, an investment banker in Manhattan. "I'm not a pessimist. The market has to stabilize."
And Jerry Hill, an account manager for Tandem Computers who was taking a break on Wall Street, said: "I'm not thinking it's the same thing as '87. The market is always subject to the fear factor, the psychology thing. But the truth is it's the only game in town. The last time, in '87, I hit the panic button and I sold. This time I just don't see enough indicators to make me panic. I personally think this is an overreaction to what is happening in Hong Kong."
By all accounts, trading was orderly. In fact, even though a lot of shares were sold, no one was admitting to doing the selling. Few people were surprised that someone was, though, given the market's long bout of exuberance. And almost everyone interviewed said the selloff presented a buying opportunity.
People talked about a market rocked by events oceans away, in Hong Kong, Japan, Europe and Thailand, and many investors, large and small, called their brokers and looked up various Internet sites to check their holdings. But smaller investors are not yet fleeing.
"It's foolish to sell at this point," said Sue Zane Williams, a retired public school teacher in Honolulu. "Why take a loss? It'll probably come back up."
Some Wall Street analysts have voiced fears that a big plunge would cause panic among many of the 25 million first-time investors who have come into the market since 1990. But in Times Square, a crumbling market was tourist fodder. People craned their necks to catch a glimpse of the huge television set on which CNBC labeled the action "Monday's Selloff," with some gawkers even training video cameras on the towering screen.
Mutual fund investors, meanwhile, made tentative steps to hedge their bets. At fund companies, calling volume was up modestly, but few reported large redemptions.
At Fidelity Investments, where phone traffic was heavy over the weekend, investors made "slight redemptions" from stock funds, said Andy Trincia, a spokesman. Much of the money, he said, was moved into taxable fixed-income funds or money market accounts.
The Vanguard Group, in Valley Forge, Pa., saw the year's first large exodus from equity funds. "There is a little bit sharper and clearer evidence that people want to move to a safe haven," said Brian Mattes, a vice president. But he added, "For every one of those, there appears to be someone who's saying this is a buying opportunity."
Despite all the calls, some analysts say many investors will not respond until they digest the day's news.
"The real volume will be seen tomorrow," said Eric Kobren, who publishes Fidelity Insight, a fund newsletter. "Individual investors continue to be the cushioning agent of the market, while it's the professional money managers who are quicker to pull the trigger and sell."
On-line brokers were in the thick of the activity. Trade-Well Discount Investing, a Manhattan service that allows investors to buy and sell over the Internet, reported that the number of on-line trades doubled to about 150 from a normal day of 75 trades.
But there was no shortage of experts offering this message: relax -- this is not the beginning of a bear market.
"I don't see this as a sign that the American economy is going to shrivel up," said Merton H. Miller, a University of Chicago professor who won the Nobel award in economics in 1990.
Lavonne Raney, 81, of Columbus, Ohio, said she had been here before. "I've lived through many of these," she said. "I was a little girl when the 1929 crash came."
Ms. Raney survived 1929, and she survived 1987, and that is why she believes she is going to survive 1997.
On Wall Street, though, it was undeniably a tense day. "When there was no bounce after the market reopened after the first trading halt, people were wondering whether the market would make it to the closing bell," said one floor trader who refused to be identified. "So instead of being a leisurely jog to 4 o'clock, it became a sprint. The real test tomorrow is: Do mom and pop have the intestinal fortitude to withstand this kind of bloodletting?"
Some show more faith than others. On their annual vacation to New York City, Susan Garbuio and her husband, William Nern, decided there were bargains to be had.
"We were having lunch and we heard that the market went down," said Ms. Garbuio, so they dropped off their packages at their hotel and went straight to a Charles Schwab office to buy stock.
But David Gilden, of Las Vegas, Nev., said, "I'm still in shock." Mr. Gilden, a retired marketing executive who has invested in stocks for more than 30 years, sold some of his mutual fund shares because they were down more than 6 percent, and he may sell more tomorrow. But he plans to hold onto most of the cash, which he socked into a money market fund. And he expects the market to fall further.
"Maybe if it was just the U.S., it would come back," he said. "But you're talking about the whole world."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET PLUNGE: THE SELLOFF;
STOCKS FALL 554 POINTS, OFF 7%, FORCING SUSPENSION IN TRADING

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
A worldwide plunge in stock prices erased more than 7 percent from the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday and forced the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading. The only other interruptions like this came after the wounding of President Ronald Reagan and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
No one knew just how far the market might have fallen had not market rules -- adopted in the wake of a stock market crash 10 years ago -- required the exchange and other American stock markets to close at 3:30 P.M., half an hour before the scheduled 4 P.M. closing bell. 
 The tumble further unnerved Asian markets as trading resumed there. After the midday break today, Hong Kong stocks were down more than 12 percent -- the sharpest fall since 1989.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues closed today down 725.97 points, or 4.26 percent, at 16,312.39. Other markets in Asia were sharply lower in morning trading.
The overnight fall on Wall Street raised concerns among investors in Asian markets that a prolonged downturn in the United States stock markets would reduce consumer demand for Asian exports. Traders also feared that the global selloff had not yet hit bottom.
As Hong Kong stocks plunged this morning, Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive of Hong Kong, called a crisis meeting of his Cabinet. Afterward, he said he considered the plunge to be temporary, telling reporters that "our fundamentals are strong, that is the most important thing." Page D25.
Yesterday, the Dow average ended down 554.26 points, or 7.2 percent, at 7,161.15, the worst day in a decade and the 12th worst ever. The drop was, however, only about a third as large as the 22.6 percent, 508-point drop on Oct. 19, 1987.
The latest plunge has been somewhat of a surprise to most American equity analysts. They had been closely watching the Federal Reserve Board and the economic statistics for any sign of rising inflation and of a Fed inclination to raise interest rates. There is little sign of danger on those fronts.
Instead, "The fear is of profit deflation emanating from Asia," said Doug Cliggott, the chief equity strategist at J. P. Morgan. Since July, several Asian currencies have fallen sharply, and more recently stock markets have followed. It appears that much of Asia, the world's fastest-growing region for much of this decade, is likely to see little if any economic growth in the near future. There is a risk that prices of many goods will fall as countries compete for dwindling export markets.
For much of the summer and early fall, even as Asian problems were growing, the American and European stock markets remained relatively strong. "Many market professionals thought the stock market was overvalued, but the market kept going up and the momentum kept them in," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist for Hoenig & Company. "Now they know it is overvalued and not going up anymore."
The Asian problems clearly threaten the profits of many multinational companies, but the reaction to them has also driven many investors into United States Treasury securities, as the safest investment around, and helped drive interest rates down.
That means, Mr. Barbera noted, that American investors may be feeling poorer with lower stock prices, but they will also be enjoying lower mortgage interest rates.
Since the Dow peaked on Aug. 6 at 8,259.31, it has fallen 13.3 percent. This is the first time since 1990 that the Dow has suffered a drop of at least 10 percent, based on daily closes. In the 1990 drop, which came as the country entered a brief recession and as Iraq invaded Kuwait, temporarily driving up oil prices, the Dow fell 21.2 percent in less than three months.
Yesterday's drop was considerably less severe than the worst loss of the 1929 crash, a 12.8 percent decline on Oct. 28, 1929 -- 68 years ago almost to the day.
Within the stock market yesterday, the fall was relatively orderly, in sharp contrast to the 1987 plunge. Traders said there was selling from nearly all types of traders, whether individual or institutional, domestic or foreign. Big Board volume was 685.5 million shares, the largest ever, but only a little above the previous session. Although it no doubt would have been higher had the market not closed early, so far the market has not seen the explosive growth in volume seen in the 1987 crash.
Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market said their systems worked well. It appeared that most people who wanted to trade -- at least before the markets closed early -- were able to. In 1987, that was not the case. "The panic of 1987, which I think was fed by the fact that phones were not being answered and people could not find out what prices were, was absent here," said Frank Zarb, the president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs Nasdaq.
Yesterday represented the first real test for so-called circuit breakers, added after 1987 in an effort to insure that prices would not plunge without reason and to give the public a chance to assess lower prices and consider buying stocks at cheap prices.
The Big Board's rule calls for a half-hour trading halt when the Dow falls 350 points and another hour if the loss widens to 550 points. With the first milestone hit, trading was halted at 2:35 P.M. Some had worried that it would be difficult to reopen after such a halt, possibly because of an imbalance of orders that came in during the break. That proved not to be the case -- only two Big Board stocks experienced any significant reopening delay -- but there was no relief from the downward pressure.
The market had halted with the Dow at 7,361.04. By 3:17, only 12 minutes after the market had reopened, the Dow was down another 100 points, and by 3:30 it had fallen a total of 550 points, and a few more by the time the closing order could be executed. Under the circuit breaker rules, the market could have reopened after a one-hour halt, but because the halt came after 3 P.M., the market closed for the day.
The most important test of the circuit breakers will come this morning when the market reopens.
The Dow ended the day yesterday down more than most market indexes, although the selling was widespread. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 6.9 percent, the Nasdaq composite lost 7.0 percent and the Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks was off 6.1 percent. Earlier in the day, all those indexes had been off significantly more than the Dow, which contains only 30 stocks.
It was possible that some selling in the Dow stocks came as the market neared the circuit breakers, with traders knowing that if the Dow stocks fell even a little more, all stocks would stop trading .
It appeared there was substantial selling of stock programs, or groups of stocks sold simultaneously by one trader. That may indicate use of some strategies known as "dynamic hedging," which call for traders to limit losses by selling as prices fall. The best-known form of program trading, called "index arbitrage," is now effectively banned when the market has a big move.
In 1929, the Big Board never closed early, although there were shortened trading hours and even market holidays, supposedly to catch up with paperwork. The only times in recent years when the Big Board has closed early due to concerns about prices were in 1963, when trading was halted in the aftermath of the assassination of President Kennedy, and in 1981, following the attempted assassination of President Reagan.
The slide in American stock prices has mirrored declines around the world that began with last week's sharp falls in Hong Kong. Nearly every market, from Britain to Brazil and from Australia to Austria, has fallen sharply.
But last week it was the United States that was doing relatively better, and thus helping to slow the worldwide selling. Yesterday the American market performed far worse than other major markets, although not as badly as Latin American markets, which were open at the same time as New York and could witness the carnage in that market.
European markets fell between 2 percent and 4 percent yesterday, and then the United States fell even more. By the end of the day in New York, only one of the S.& P. 500 stocks gained for the day. Apple Computer rose 19 cents to $16.75, apparently on speculation that Steve Jobs, its co-founder, would agree to be chief executive again.

Charts: "Another Black October Day"
A sharp correction in stock prices had been so widely expected in recent months that until yesterday its failure to appear was beginning to irk some market analysts. But yesterday's plunge still managed to spring some surprises: in its scale, in the events that set it off and in the way it tripped circuit breakers installed after the 1987 crash.

Since July 1, the Dow has gained or lost at least 1 percent in a day 25 times. So far in 1997, 30 percent of trading days have seen 1-percent moves in the Dow; the average for years since 1940 is 17 percent.

"ERASING PAPER WEALTH"
Yesterday's market decline wiped out billions of dollars in market capitalization around the world. Owners of most stocks are now poorer -- on paper -- than they were yesterday. But the bull market's gains before yesterday mean that most investors still own stocks worth more than they paid for them, and so have not yet lost any money they invested, but only forgone some profits.

Bulk Discount Approved For Buses and Subways

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority gave final approval yesterday to a bulk discount that will effectively cut the bus and subway fare to $1.36, from $1.50, in January.
The 9 percent discount, equivalent to getting 11 trips for the price of 10, will be offered to Metrocard customers who put at least $15 on their cards. 
 Several speakers at yesterday's M.T.A. board meeting, however, said the authority should be doing even more for riders because its revenues are running about $100 million ahead of schedule this year.
Between increased ridership, higher tax revenue from New York's economic boom and lower-than-expected expenses, the authority could have an extra $160 million by the end of the year, the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said.
Mr. Vallone asked the authority to roll the fare back to its 1995 level of $1.25. Jonathan Sigall, a staff planner for the Permanent Citizens Advisory Council to the M.T.A., urged the board to consider offering monthly passes. And an aide to Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Democrat representing parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, asked the board to provide free rides for children and the elderly.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY MARATHON: SPECIAL PREVIEW SECTION;
Marathon Is Staged As Outdoor Theater

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
AS SHE entered Central Park for a training run before the 1996 New York City Marathon, Tegla Loroupe of Kenya was spotted by a homeless man, who sat up from a bench and called out to the two-time winner, "Are you that runner, that Tegla?"
"I wasn't expecting that," Loroupe said. "But that is why I love New York, the people." 
 Where else but New York will someone yell out of a window as the four-hour marathoners reach the halfway point, "You can all stop now, we have a winner."
And what other city would cheer, "Come on, Sister," for a hairy-legged man wearing a habit and running as a billboard for Blue Nun wine?
"I don't want to sound religious, but marathon day is almost the best day for humanity," said Phyllis Marchand, the deputy mayor of Princeton, N.J., who will be running her 14th New York City Marathon on Sunday.
"The diversity and pulling together of people is something that I think is extraordinary. You see police interacting, you see Hasidic Jews working with African-Americans, who are working with the Latino community. I wish every day could be marathon day."
There is nothing quite like the organized chaos of the New York City Marathon, which winds its way through the city's five boroughs for 26.2 miles in a procession that is equal parts race, fitness celebration, street festival and sociological statement.
The race is singular in many ways, from the size of the field (30,463 entrants as of late September) to the embrace of the crowd (an estimated 2 million spectators line the streets from Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn to the finish line in Central Park).
Gina Martinelli, a physical therapist from Havertown, Pa., would like to run a marathon in as many states as possible. She has run four marathons thus far, from Anchorage, Alaska, to Boston, and now she will attempt New York.
"I want to be able to say I accomplished the biggest marathon in the world," Martinelli said.
This year's field, which is approximately one-third local, one-third national and one-third international in makeup, includes runners from every state but North Dakota, and from 95 countries ranging from Albania to Zimbabwe.
A woman from Iran will compete among the recreational runners this year, and another from Algeria and China. And among Sunday's marathoners will be 1,592 administrators, 1,400 attorneys, 1,275 teachers, 72 hairdressers and 55 bartenders.
"You can look at the professions and it pretty much reflects what's going on in this country," said Marchand, the deputy mayor of Princeton. "Last year, or the year before, I looked under politicians, and there were 2 women and 4 men; there were probably more, but they didn't want to own up to it."
In its 28th running, the New York City Marathon is facing growing competition for top runners from other fall marathons in Chicago and Japan.
Todd Williams, America's top 10,000-meter runner, decided to make his marathon debut on Oct. 19 in Chicago, where the course was flatter and faster and the financial incentives were more enticing. Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, the 1996 Olympic champion, will run her fall marathon in Fukuoka, Japan.
New York has received criticism for not catering enough to top American marathoners. Some runners and agents say that New York's prize structure is not big enough or deep enough, noting that its first-place prize of $50,000 is $25,000 less than Boston awarded in April.
Dave D'Alessandro, a top executive with the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company and the man credited with revitalizing the Boston Marathon, has accused New York of losing its focus and diminishing its international aura, calling the event "overwhelming."
Allan Steinfeld, race director of the New York City Marathon, takes sharp issue with these criticisms. The prize money doubles for Americans who finish among the top five, he notes. Boston requires qualifying times for entry, which makes it different from New York, where 10,562 runners entered this year are competing in their first marathon. Finishing is important to them, not winning.
"We have an open race; it's a people's event," Steinfeld said. "At the same time, we will match our elite athletes and their fame and fortune against any marathon. When something happens in New York, it is national and international news."
New York has faithfully maintained the ideals of the race's founder, Fred Lebow, which is to put on an international marathon that reflects an international city, Steinfeld said.
Even though the race is now being shown nationally on ESPN2 instead of its parent company, ABC, Steinfeld said the marathon will reach 300 million households worldwide in 75 to 100 countries. (In New York, the race will be televised on WPIX, Channel 11.) The yearly local economic impact is $100 million, Steinfeld said.
"It's more of an international race than any marathon in the world," he said.
Among the elite runners, Loroupe owns the fastest women's time in the world this year: 2 hours 22 minutes 7 seconds. German Silva, a two-time winner from Mexico, is returning in hopes of a third title.
"If you win New York, you are recognized everywhere," Silva said. "I love the environment, the hotels where everybody is speaking different languages, the neighborhoods. When I won, I couldn't pay for a meal."
Mark Coogan, a 1996 Olympian from Boulder, Colo., is the top American contender in this year's field. Born in Manhasset, N.Y., Coogan will be running his first marathon in New York City. As a high school runner, he kept a poster in his room showing the arm-raised ecstasy of Rod Dixon of New Zealand, the 1983 winner, and the crumpled agony of Geoff Smith of Britain, who was passed after 26 miles and lost by 9 seconds.
"If you're a marathoner, New York is one you should try," Coogan said. "I've been watching tapes of previous races. I get nervous watching people line up on the bridge, the crowds, the boats. I've been to the race the last three years, and your heart starts going fast, and you tell yourself, 'Why am I not doing this?' "
Is there a more compelling scene in all of sports than the start on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, with 30,000 runners squeezing through the start like corpuscles through an artery, beginning a 26-mile journey that others might consider impossible or crazy?
"It's exciting to see the city in the distance," said Leslie Buckland, a 68-year-old adventurer from Manhattan who reached 24,500 feet on Mt. Everest last May and who will run his 22d New York City Marathon.
"It's rather like running to a castle in medieval days. You tell yourself, 'I'm going to storm the ramparts of Elsinore,' and then you start running. Every time I do the last 100 yards, I'm weeping. How many people in their lives have thousands and thousands of people cheering for them?"
At 16 miles, the runners come off the Queensboro Bridge and are greeted by a wall of sound along First Avenue. Always runners are warned not to be seduced by the siren call of the crowds with 10 miles remaining. Almost always, they succumb to the cheering.
It is the hospitality here and in the ethnic neighborhoods, especially, that makes the race what it is and that dispels, for an afternoon anyway, any notion of New York as a dangerous, forbidding, uncaring city.
No one who has run the race can fail to be moved by the bands playing, the children slapping hands as the runners pass, the volunteers handing out water, candy, slices of orange and unfailing encouragement.
"When you run through New York, it seems like you run through so many different communities and so many thought processes," said Keith Brantly, a 1996 Olympian who finished fifth in New York in 1993.
Susan Wilson, a native of Manhattan who lives in Princeton, has run everywhere from London to Hanoi, and at 67, she will attempt her first marathon. New York seemed to be the natural place.
"I remember learning how to roller skate in Central Park," Wilson said. "When I started running 15 years ago, I started around the reservoir. It is sort of my backyard.
"I'm looking at this as a one-shot deal, with my fingers crossed. There's nothing like the crowds they're going to have. You'll see people at their best. I think it will be a transcendent experience."

Charts: "Marathoners, New Yorkers and 'Others' "
According to information provided by the entrants, the quintessential New York City marathoner would be male, married and thirtysomething, with a graduate degree and a New York address. Even though applicants could choose from 71 professions - including bartender (55 entrants), filmmaker (90), retired (318), security guard (40) and unemployed (71) - the most prevalent occupation was "other" (7,839).
 
"Years and People to Remember"
1970
The first marathon is a multiple-lap run through Central Park, with 127 starters and 55 finishers. The winner is Gary Muhrcke, a New York City firefighter.
 
1976
The marathon visits all five boroughs for the first time, and Bill Rodgers scores the first of his four consecutive victories. The marathon and its new champion become instant stars.
 
1983
In a steady rain, Rod Dixon, above, closes a large hap and passes Geoff Smith at the 26-mile mark on his way to a dramatic nine-second victory.
 
1988
Grete Waitz, left, remains the race's most-loved and most-decorated champion. In 1988, the Norwegian captures her ninth and last title - after having won eight from 1978-86 and setting three world records along with way. In 1992, when she ran with the race director Fred Lebow as he battled cancer, it seemed as if the cheers of "Grete, Grete" had never stopped.
 
1994
German Silva of Mexico wins the first of his two titles despite making a wrong turn into Central Park seventenths of a mile from the finish.
 
1996
Giacomo Leone, who wasn't chosen for the Italian Olympic team, surprises everyone with his closing speed and joins past Italian winners like Orlando Pizzolato and Gianni Poli. Anuta Catuna of Romania is the women's champion.

Am I a Little Tipsy, or Did That Martini Glass Just Grow?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
THE martini has just been supersized. In one fell swoop, the standard 6-ounce glass has ballooned to 10 ounces at restaurants like Ben Benson's and Smith & Wollensky in Manhattan, where the steaks used to be the biggest thing on the menu. The king of drinks now joins the one-pound muffin, the triple bacon cheeseburger and the Lincoln Town Car as a potent symbol of America the Huge.
Ten ounces. That's a long way to the bottom of the glass. The big-gulp martini may be the first cocktail that requires channel markers and a lifeguard. It certainly changes the complexion of the three-martini lunch, which will now have to be regarded as a suicide pact rather than as a meal. 
 It also makes William Powell as Nick Charles look like a sissy. Close scrutiny of "The Thin Man" movies shows that the wicked martini of the 1930's came attired in a dainty curved glass, a four-ouncer by the look of it, that would be appropriate for a late-afternoon sweet sherry. No wonder he was always trying to catch up on his drinking -- he was sipping from a thimble. Myrna Loy, as Nora Charles, knocks back five martinis in a row at the beginning of the movie, and it looked pretty audacious at the time. Now we know she was just trying to get a decent-sized drink.
Ignore economic irrelevancies like interest rates, the Dow Jones industrial average and housing starts. The martini just went up four ounces. The recovery is official. WILLIAM GRIMES

HEADLINE: Reform Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Contrary to Peter Passell's Oct. 23 Economic Scene column on Social Security, I don't propose to "limit reforms to tucks and trims that would delay the day of reckoning for perhaps an extra decade." What I and others propose is to choose among several options to bring the program into balance for the 75-year period for which actuarial estimates are usually made. 
 These options include extending coverage, increasing taxation of benefits, improving the accuracy of cost-of-living adjustments, increasing the contribution rate (less than a third of 1 percent) and reducing benefits for those retiring in the future by 3 percent to 6 percent.
The need for even these modest tax increases and benefit cuts could be greatly reduced by changing the policy of investing Social Security money only in low-yield government bonds and instead allowing partial investment in equities. These are not "tucks and trims." They would maintain Social Security in long-term balance without diverting money into a new system of individual accounts that do nothing to help Social Security's financing.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Non-Panic of '97

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
This was not It.
In July, just as the stock market was reaching its peak, I donned my sandwich boards and wrote: "You're going to see a correction one of these days that will curl your hair, followed by a year in the doldrums before the next recovery. . . . Repent! The end is near." 
 Greed being what it is, I didn't dump much after my own jeremiad, which is why nobody can hate me after the babyboomers' babybust and bounceback.
But this was not a hair-curler. Instead, it was the shakeout of nervous professionals who were looking for some outside event to justify a rush to lock in the year's profits.
Turmoil in the Asian markets, reflecting incipient deflation there, was the cathartic our traders were waiting for. America's small investor, however, was not suckered by all the globalony. When market averages backed 10 to 15 percent off their highs, the little guy resisted all chicken-littling. Only the market, not the sky, was falling.
What explains the Non-Panic of '97?
It was not Robert Rubin standing on the steps of the Treasury saying "the fundamental economy is strong." Such pronouncements by government officials smack of "prosperity is just around the corner"; they reassure nobody.
One reason for the non-panic was that the media, which love anniversaries, have been reminding us for weeks of the 22 percent market break of '87, compared with which Gray Monday's drop of 7 percent was not so terrible. "Selloff" was the preferred term of commentators; few used the scarier term "crash."
A better reason is that the fundament is strong. Inflation and unemployment are down, and growth and profits are up.
Global domino effect? A worry but not a panicker; any drop in demand for our exports to Asia is not going to put much of a crimp in our huge national product. And Asian investors aren't crazy; they'll look for safe havens, of which there are no safer than U.S. stocks and bonds.
That's why this week's market turmoil is not It. Like Californians after a mild quake, we can say, "But this wasn't the Big One."
There is a good message in all the bouncing down and up, however, to be directed to the new-age, new-paradigm new-economists who waltz hand in hand with Goldilocks and Rosie Scenario.
That message is: There are other ways to go besides up. Just as the fluctuating nature of the stock market has not been fundamentally altered by the end of the cold war or the beginning of the globalized computer age, economies will stumble and recover as they have in the past.
Just as markets breathe, economies breathe. That natural inhaling and exhaling, contraction and expansion, means that the business cycle has not been steamrollered into permanent flatness. Someday we will have a recession.
A market drop may not trigger a recession, but a recession always harms the stock market. Reduced profits reduce tax revenues and increase the budget deficit.
Now to the big lesson we can draw from the market's wake-up call. President Clinton proudly pointed to the shrinking of our deficit to the lowest in decades. His economists see the deficit in the fiscal year that ended last month to be $22 billion.
But in February of this year, the Office of Management and Budget was predicting a deficit of $125 billion. It was off by $100 billion, plus change, not because of any spending restraint but because an economic boom produced greater revenues.
If we can be that wrong on the downside, we can be that wrong on the upside. As recession follows prosperity (as night follows day, and as market shakeouts follow run-ups), then all the optimistic budget agreements on which we base our spending and taxing will be knocked into a cocked hat.
The message this week is that markets have a downside, and that it is wise to keep a little cash on the side. Economies also have a downside, and it would be wise for our political leaders to treat as hogwash the predictions of the new-era economists that the only way is up.
Hand me those sandwich boards. As I was saying about a market break before a real recession, Repent! The end is near.

HEADLINE: Britain Is No Model On Job Creation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A news analysis on the decision by Germany's central bank to raise short-term interest rates (Business Day, Oct. 23) suggests that European countries are becoming less competitive because of social welfare policies and says that Britain has promoted job creation through labor market flexibility. 
 According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, productivity growth in European countries has consistently been faster than in the United States. Since 1979, productivity in France and Germany has increased by 48.8 percent and 54.9 percent, respectively. This compares with an increase of just 13.8 percent in the United States.
While Britain does have significantly lower unemployment than most European countries, it has not achieved this through job growth. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Britain actually lost 70,000 jobs from 1989 to 1996. Job growth in France and Germany was extremely slow, but at least there was growth.
The decline in Britain's unemployment rate was because many workers became so discouraged that they gave up looking for work and were therefore no longer counted in the unemployment data.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS;
In Their Own Words

 BODY:

RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI
During a visit yesterday to Maria Hernandez Park in Bushwick, Brooklyn, the Mayor commented on the plunge in stock prices on Wall Street on Monday. 
 "The city is a lot more stable today than it was 4 years ago, or 10 years ago. The general reserve of the City of New York is five times what it was in 1987, two and a half times what it was in 1993. In other words, we're saving $500 million now. We used to save only $200 million and $100 million. Through welfare reform, again for which there's a lot of political criticism, we saved over $650 million. So the city is in a lot more stable position than it was in a few years ago. We've cut the work force by 24,000 city-funded; over all by 36,000. So the margin of what the city could now absorb is much greater than it was back then."
 
RUTH W. MESSINGER
To students at Long Island University in Brooklyn yesterday.
"The ups and downs on Wall Street have shown that it's not good for the city to have so many of our eggs in that basket -- that what the city needs to do is encourage new kinds of businesses to grow. We definitely need to encourage businesses to grow because we are living right now with an unemployment rate in the City of New York which is much too high. When I say much too high, I mean it is higher than that of almost every other city in the country, every other large city in the country. And I mean that what is most troubling is that our unemployment rate now is 9.3 percent, is just about twice the national average. So whatever is happening nationally that has allowed the economy to grow, jobs to be created and unemployment to go down is not happening here."

HEADLINE: Dollar Finishes Lower in a Broad Slump

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled to a five-month low against the Swiss franc and a four-month low versus the German mark yesterday despite a powerful rebound in United States stocks.
The dollar also finished lower against the Japanese yen and other European currencies despite rebounding slightly in volatile trading after stocks recovered from their big losses on Monday. 
 The dollar was unable to recoup all of its early losses yesterday, however, because trading was lighter in North America than overseas, where most of the damage to the dollar occurred before the United States stock market opened, said Christopher Low, a senior economist at HSBC Securities.
Traders turned to the European currencies as havens instead of the dollar because those countries' economies are seen as being less dependent on Asia, where a financial crisis had led to the global drop in stocks in the last week.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4223 Swiss francs, down from 1.4499 late Monday, to reach its lowest point since May 30. It also settled at 1.7368 marks, down from 1.7495, and its lowest level since June 26.
The dollar traded at 120.47 yen, down from 121.87. It also remained weak against the British pound after dropping to a three-month low on Monday when the British Government said it would not quickly join Europe's planned common currency. Yesterday, the pound sold for $1.6711, up from $1.6595.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Expected to Postpone Discussion of Higher Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Even after the sharp rebound today in stock prices, analysts said that turmoil in the markets would force the Federal Reserve Board to postpone consideration of raising interest rates until next year, and that it could diminish any risk of the economy's overheating.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is scheduled to lay out his view of the economy to a Congressional committee on Wednesday morning. Economists said he would almost certainly avoid making any comments that might unnerve the markets, especially in the wake of the rout on Monday that erased 7.2 percent from the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 In Congressional testimony three weeks ago, Mr. Greenspan warned that the bull market might not be sustainable, and he suggested that further declines in the already low unemployment rate could cause inflation. His comments led investors to conclude that the Fed might raise rates as soon as its next policy meeting, on Nov. 12, if unemployment fell more and growth remained strong.
But because Wall Street bounced back so strongly today -- and because the financial system had no apparent problem weathering the plunge on Monday -- analysts said Mr. Greenspan was unlikely to make any explicit promise to loosen monetary policy to reassure investors.
"The market turmoil has obviated the need for any Fed tightening in the near term," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan & Company. "If anything, it's the chairman's role to calm the markets rather than giving them anything to worry about."
The analysts said they expected Mr. Greenspan to emphasize the message that the Clinton Administration stressed in the last two days: the economy and the financial system remain fundamentally sound. Speaking in Chicago this morning at about the time that the Dow Jones industrial average was shooting back into positive territory for the day, President Clinton said the economy was "as strong and vibrant as it has been in a generation."
Mr. Greenspan will be able to point to statistics released today suggesting that the risks of inflation are not rising substantially. The Labor Department reported wages are not rising at a rate that greatly increases the danger of inflation. The Conference Board, a business group, said the high levels of consumer confidence that had helped drive growth had begun to ebb even before the Monday stock rout rattled investors.
Economists said the Federal Reserve might also have pared its growth projections to account for the troubles afflicting Asia. The United States sends about a third of its exports to Asia, and the weakened economies there, combined with a strong dollar, are expected to reduce demand for American goods enough to trim economic growth in the United States for the rest of this year and into the next.
The devaluation of many Asian currencies will also depress the price in dollars of goods imported from that region, helping restrain inflation in the United States, economists said.
"Economic growth is in the process of slowing down," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "The stock market correction is going to make the slowdown a bit more pronounced, especially because the balance of trade will deteriorate as a result of the Asian currency meltdown."
Mr. Sohn said that Mr. Greenspan's concerns about the tight labor market were unlikely to have dissipated, and that the economy might not slow enough to avert the outbreak of wage and price pressures early next year.
"I don't think we should eliminate the possibility of a Fed tightening in February if financial market conditions stabilize," he said.
Even in the absence of market turmoil, the economic reports issued today would probably have strengthened the case for the Fed's holding interest rates steady for at least a month or two.
The Labor Department's Employment Cost Index, a broad measure of changes in wages and benefits, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter, the same increase shown in the previous quarter. The figure matched the expectations of analysts and suggested that wages were not rising rapidly enough to set off inflation alarms.
Wages and salaries rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter, compared with eight-tenths in the second quarter, but benefit increases slowed to four-tenths of 1 percent from six-tenths.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 123.3 this month from 130.2 in September. Because much of the economy's strength this year has come from the willingness of consumers to spend and accrue additional debt, any reduction in their optimism could translate into less spending and a reduction in growth to a rate less likely to set off inflation. But whether the stock market's gyrations will further erode consumer confidence is an open question.
"It's too early to determine whether the October decline signals the beginning of a downward trend in consumer confidence or whether it's simply a temporary blip in a still-strong upward pattern," said Lynn Franco, the associate director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.

HEADLINE: After First Sinking With Asia, Europe Recovers With U.S.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 28

 BODY:
European stock markets recovered in part from early selloffs today, lifted at the end of their trading sessions by an upturn on Wall Street.
Faced with another overnight rout on Asian markets, European markets plunged at the opening. In London, Europe's biggest market, the Financial Times Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares fell as much as 9 percent in the morning. 
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index of 30 leading stocks plummeted 400 points, or 13 percent, in the first 30 minutes of trading. Stocks in France, Switzerland and other markets also fell sharply.
"The volume was extraordinary; we nearly had a record high," said Reta Francioni, a member of the Frankfurt stock exchange's executive board. "But it was a correction, not a crash. We had orderly markets."
The markets later steadied and then recovered some lost ground as United States stocks, which open in the last hour to two hours of European trading, began to climb.
The Financial Times index closed just 1.76 percent, or 85.3 points, lower. The DAX ended the session off 8.04 percent, or 311.90 points, but the loss was further cut in after-hours electronic trading, with the DAX index ending down 5.83 percent, or 225.70. French and Swiss stocks recovered from slumps of as much as 10 percent. The Paris CAC-40 index closed down 118.31, or 4.27 percent, while the Swiss market index closed down 253.8, or 4.59 percent.
As European markets steadied today, economists contended that the turmoil in Asian markets should not significantly change the basic economic outlook for Europe.
Though Europe's inchoate economic recovery has been driven primarily by exports, many experts argue that exports to Southeast Asia do not account for enough of the total to make a big dent in the growth prospects for countries like Germany and France.
Kermit Schoenholtz, chief economist for Salomon Brothers, said the turmoil in Hong Kong and the panic in world stock markets had not changed the fundamental prospects for strong economic growth in Europe's biggest countries next year.
"Personally, I believe that growth in core Europe in 1998 will be the fastest since 1990," Mr. Schoenholtz said today. "It will probably exceed the growth rate of the United States for the first time in several years."
To be sure, there were plenty of signs of panic, particularly in the emerging markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Russian stock markets, which have climbed faster than those of any other country in the world and have tripled the last 12 months, were shut down for several hours today as panic set in. Brokers said prices plunged at least 20 percent in over-the-counter trading.
Currencies in Eastern and Central Europe lost value against the dollar amid speculation that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic might follow the path of Southeast Asia.
But some experts doubted Central and Eastern Europe would fall. "In Eastern Europe, the financial systems are in better shape," said Stuart Parkinson at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Sneezes and the Russians Catch a Chill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 28

 BODY:
During Soviet days, a stock-market plunge in the West would have been cause for rejoicing in the Kremlin.
But with a pro-capitalist Government, a fledging stock market and a crying need for Western financing, the new Russia is increasingly integrated into the world economy. So much so that Monday's stock plunge in New York sent shock waves through Russia's capital, prompting a frantic effort by top Yeltsin aides to head off the panic selling of stocks and Government bonds. 
 Even so, the Kremlin's effort failed to stop the precipitous fall in the stock market here, as shares fell about 40 per cent from their August high.
Economists also warned that unease over emerging markets has already hurt the federal Government, which has sold bonds internationally and domestically to help finance the budget deficit. Local governments hungry for capital have also been hurt. The result could be still more painful retrenchments in government spending.
"The Russian economy fully felt itself to be a part of the world economic system," observed Sergei Dubinin, chairman of the Central Bank.
This is by no means the equivalent of Black Tuesday, the day in 1994 when the ruble collapsed and the panic that ensued affected everyone. The average Russian, however, owns no stocks, mutual funds or Government bonds.
But like stock markets in the West, the Russian stock exchange had been on an ascending track, tripling over the past 18 months. Foreign investors have not been the only ones snapping up the stocks. Increasingly, Russian companies and the Russian business elite have also been getting into the act.
While brokers here have boasted that the Russian stock market was the hottest in the world, there have been increasing indications that the bull market was turning into a Russian bear.
Last week, the Russian stock market took a hit as the economic turmoil in Southeast Asia began to sour foreign investors on all emerging markets, despite the dissimilarities between the Russian and Southeast Asian economies.
Monday's plunge on the New York Stock Exchange sent the market here into a tailspin. The leading shares in the Russian market lost 19 per cent of their value today.
Peter Kizenko, the chief of equity trading in Moscow for ING Barings estimated that stocks in general were down about 40 per cent from their high in early August. "Russia is cheap once again," quipped Mr. Kizenko, who added that he expected the market to recover.
But not everybody was laughing. The Russian Government halted trading for several hours today in a vain effort to halt the slide. The Central Bank bought up rubles to stabilize the Russian currency.
Central Bank officials also sought to boost the slumping market for Russian treasury bonds. The once sky-high interest rates of the treasury bills have declined considerably this year and the Russian Government is not eager to assume the huge costs of paying higher interest rates to attract buyers.
Top Central Bank officials bluntly warned Russian banks and companies -- which depend heavily on Government connections and good will -- not to abandon the treasury bill market.
Sergei Aleksashenko, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, said it would take "traditional and uncustomary measures to support the stability of the state bond market."
"Those Russian companies that blindly copy foreign investors' actions may lose their capital," he added sternly.
But the effects were already being felt abroad. Charles Blitzer, chief economist for emerging markets at the London office of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the interest rate for Russian Eurobonds had already shot up.
The rising cost of borrowing, he noted, will mean "less foreign borrowing and will slow down economic growth." After a long period of economic decline and stagnation, Russian economists have hoped that the economy would begin to grow in 1998.
Still, Mr. Blitzer and most other economists stress that Russia's change of fortune has little to do with economic developments within Russia -- and everything to do with the global capital markets. Investors have sought safer assets because of anxiety over soaring stock prices in the United States this year and troubled Asian economies.
"What is going on in terms of Russia is not a market vote on that country," he said. "Nothing fundamental has happened in Russia."
That thought, at least, was some consolation to Russian politicians, who tried to put on a brave face.
"We aren't behind an Iron Curtain, so we have to take our share of both the good and the bad," First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais said today during a visit to London. "The crisis will weaken the weakest and strengthen the strongest."

HEADLINE: Impasse Remaining, Senate Ends Effort on Highway Bill

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The Senate today abandoned its efforts to pass a six-year highway financing bill after supporters of a campaign finance overhaul once again blocked the popular $145 billion highway measure from being brought toward a final vote.
In a day of increasing brinksmanship across the Capitol, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, pronounced the highway measure "apparently dead for the year." In an effort to press the Democrats by blaming them for denying money for new roads, bridges and public transit projects across the nation, Mr. Lott also said he would not agree to the simple six-month extension the House favored. 
 Raising the stakes in the campaign finance standoff, Mr. Lott also said he would keep from the Senate floor trade legislation avidly sought by President Clinton unless Democrats agreed to separate that issue from the campaign finance controversy and to provide a significant number of votes to break an expected filibuster.
The threats capped another day in which Congress, no longer united by the spring's common drive to approve a balanced budget agreement, remained nearly stymied by partisan standoffs. Besides campaign finance, legislators were stuck over a contested House seat, discontent over legislation to store nuclear waste in Nevada and the inability of the White House and Congress to reach agreement on several controversies snagging major spending bills.
The Federal highway program expired on Sept. 30, and states have been using reserve money to keep as many as 1,900 construction programs going. But the Senate's Democrats, joined by a handful of Republicans, have been bottling up all but essential spending bills in their effort to secure a commitment to an early vote on campaign finance legislation next year.
Today, for the fourth time in several days, 45 Democrats, joined by 3 Republicans, prevented consideration of the full six-year highway bill. Senate Republicans fell 8 votes short of the 60 needed to stop a filibuster against the highway construction program.
After the vote, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said Democrats would allow a simple six-month extension of the highway and bridge construction financing to move forward.
But Mr. Lott said he would not agree to a six-month program.
"I think it is unfortunate," he said. "The Democrats continue to play games with campaign finance reform."
The National Governors' Association sent a plea to Senate leaders that the legislation be extended for a short term, saying a lapse of financing for several months would "have disastrous affects on many states' transportation programs."
With just weeks remaining in the Congressional session, the legislative slowdown has threatened to engulf Mr. Clinton's faltering bid for "fast track" authority to negotiate free-trade deals that Congress can approve or disapprove but not amend. Mr. Clinton considers such authority a cornerstone of his economic program and his definition as a New Democrat.
"For the life of me," the President said in a speech this week, "I can't figure out why anybody in the wide world believes it will create jobs for us to stay out of markets that other people are in when we can win the competitive wars."
The trade authority is bitterly opposed by organized labor and by many of the President's fellow Democrats, particularly in the House where the Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, is leading the opposition.
Until now, House Republicans have refused to schedule action on the trade measure until Mr. Clinton can promise them 70 Democratic votes. They have argued that they do not want to risk an embarrassing defeat on free trade.
"I'm perfectly willing to put it on the floor tomorrow," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. "But I'm not willing to put it on the floor and have it lose, so we've got to get the votes together."
A dozen Democratic supporters of the trade measure met with Speaker Newt Gingrich today to urge him to push forward with a vote. They said many wavering Democratic lawmakers simply would not make up their minds until they were forced to, because they hoped that they could avoid taking sides between Mr. Clinton and organized labor.
"It's time to burn the ship so that there's no retreat," said Representative James P. Moran, Democrat of Virginia.
After his meeting with the Democrats, Mr. Gingrich went to the White House to consult with the President . Barry Toiv, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said tonight that the two leaders discussed strategy on how to propel the trade measure forward but did not set a timetable for a vote.
Because of the lack of Democratic support in the House, the White House has looked to the Senate to begin the trade debate, in hopes that it will muster the 60 votes needed to break an expected filibuster by Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, and give momentum to the bill.
But today Mr. Daschle said Democrats would stand firm in their vow to block virtually all Senate action as a tool in their effort to win a commitment to a renewed campaign finance debate early next year, including the trade measure.
"I just happen to disagree with the White House about the urgency of this legislation,' he said before catching himself and insisting that he had no disagreement with the White House on the trade bill.
Mr. Daschle went on to say the President and his aides had not asked Senate Democrats to exempt the trade legislation from their strategy of gridlock "because they understand the unanimity and the depth of feeling that our caucus has on campaign reform."
The Senate did manage today to give final passage to a $13.8 billion spending measure that increases money for national parks and retains the National Endowment for the Arts. But White House officials said Mr. Clinton could veto the bill because of various timber provisions affecting Northwestern forests.
"We are mulling it over," said Lawrence Haas, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Lose Their Haven Status as Stocks Recover

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities declined sharply yesterday, once again zigging as the stock market zagged.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 337.17, to 7,498.32, overcoming more than half of Monday's 554-point loss, and with that rebound investor demand for government securities as a safe haven dried up. 
 Bond traders began refocusing their attention on the concerns that were in place before stocks plunged. Rate fears top that list of concerns.
Market participants have again started demanding higher yields to compensate for any risk that strong economic data could cause the Fed to step in and raise short-term rates to keep inflation contained -- a move that would cause bond prices to tumble.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 2 4/32, to 101 9/32, pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, up to 6.28 percent from 6.14 percent on Monday. Yesterday's decline erased about two-thirds of the gains made over the last three days.
Volume yesterday was the highest ever, according to Maureen Mooney, an analyst with GovPx, a bond pricing service, surpassing the $139.4 billion record set on March 26, a day after the Fed raised short-term rates. Late yesterday the volume of Treasuries bought and sold was well over $148 billion and climbing, with $150 billion within sight.
Despite the heavy trading, analysts said yesterday's Treasury auction of $15 billion of new two-year notes was only mediocre. The notes were auctioned at a price to yield 5.720 percent, the lowest since 5.662 percent on Nov. 19, 1996. The market's recent surge did not allow dealers to set up properly for the auction. Often dealers will raise yields ahead of an auction to insure good demand, so that the securities will move quickly to investors and away from the shelves of dealers.
Today the Treasury will auction $11 billion of new five-year notes. In when-issued trading yesterday, dealers were offering the note at a price to yield 5.88 percent, up from 5.69 percent on Monday.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said, "The 30-year Treasury bond yield should return to around 6.30 percent."
The release of the Employment Cost Index for the third quarter yesterday, showing a rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent from the second quarter, was within expectations and reinforced the view that inflation pressures remained under control.
Still, traders will be awaiting today's testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, before the Joint Economic Committee for any clue to Fed intentions about interest rates or mention of the recent turmoil in the stock market.
Amy Ary, chief fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research in Boston, expects that today will probably bring more losses to the bond market, unless there is another drop in the Asian and European stock markets. "But given how well the U.S. recovered," she said, "it would be unlikely to see overseas markets deteriorate further."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Japanese Stocks Bounce Back Day After Trading Was Curbed

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Japan's long-suffering stock market enjoyed a rebound this morning, sharing in some of the relief Wall Street experienced yesterday.
The Nikkei stock average rose 3.46 percent, gaining 564.93 to close at 16,877.62 in the morning session. Large exporters, led by Honda, Toyota, and Canon, paced the climb. 
 The gain, however, left the average short of where it was trading before the recent plunge and still below the psychologically important 17,000 point level.
On Tuesday, the Nikkei had plunged 4.26 percent, as investors panicked on concerns that a prolonged downturn in the American stock markets would reduce consumer demand in Japanese exporters' biggest foreign market.
For the first time since the Persian Gulf war of 1991, the Tokyo Stock Exchange imposed some limitations on trading on Tuesday. The exchange does not apply circuit breakers in the spot market, although they are used in some cases in the futures market. But to stanch Tuesday's bleeding, officials took the unusual steps of narrowing the price increments at which shares trade and doubling the interval between the postings of share prices.
The immediate cause of Tuesday's selloff here was Wall Street's slide on Monday, and Government officials and business leaders rushed to reassure investors that the American economy was fundamentally sound. But many analysts brushed aside their words as irrelevant to the long-term outlook for Tokyo stocks, which are weighed down by the dismal state of Japan's own economy.
The influence of the fall in American stock prices on the Japanese market is light, because so many stocks have already fallen so far that it's not possible for them to go lower, said Norimitsu Otsubo, senior analyst at Wako Research.
Indeed, so many shares are trading below 200 yen (about $1.65), including those of such household names as Kanebo and NKK, that the Japanese press has dubbed them "chewing gum" stocks because about the only thing you could buy if you cashed one in is a pack of gum, which sells for around 100 yen.
Even if today's rebound on Wall Street is sustained, few analysts here expect the Nikkei to follow suit. "The correction in Japan will continue," said Yasushi Suzuki, manager of investment and information services at Nomura Securities Inc. "The economic slowdown here is continuing."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Follows U.S., Staging a Strong Rebound

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Wednesday, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded early here today on relief after Wall Street's explosive rally on Tuesday.
Other Asian markets were also sharply higher at midday. 
 Hong Kong's chief stock index, the Hang Seng, surged more than 17 percent in the first three minutes of trading before settling back. At the midday recess in trading, the index was up 1,512.42 points, or 16.69 percent, at 10,572.31 points. The rally was led by shares of real estate and financial services companies.
Asia took its cue this morning from the revival of American stocks, much as Latin America did on Tuesday. Mexico's chief market index roared back 7.2 percent, Brazil's rebounded by 6.4 percent and Argentina's gained 6 percent.
Despite today's early surge in Hong Kong, there is no sign that the crisis that has gripped the market here since last week has passed.
On Tuesday in Hong Kong, the epicenter of Asia's market turmoil, stocks plunged 13.7 percent, more than double the previous session's descent. It was the biggest decline in points ever and the biggest percentage drop since 1989. Since August, the selloff has erased nearly a third of the Hang Seng's value.
"We're dead; we're dead," people repeatedly moaned on Tuesday as they punched stock codes into terminals at Kincheng Bank in the dense streets of Causeway Bay and stared in disbelief at the numbers that popped up.
Chan Yuk Shui, a 65-year-old retired businessman, groped for a metaphor to describe his anguish and settled on the Shanghai crustaceans that are bound in twine and boiled alive as a seasonal treat. "We've all become hairy crabs; we're all tied down," Mr. Chan lamented. "What can we do? We can't go jumping off buildings." Around him, other retirees prepared to camp out at the market terminals. "We came here early in the morning to 'work,' " one said. "We're going to stay here until the market closes. We thought we could make some money for our retirement funds, but we've lost everything."
At computer terminals scattered throughout Hong Kong on Tuesday, crowds were packed two and three deep as investors watched their portfolios shrink.
Many saw their life's efforts shredded before their eyes.
For here, playing the stock market has become an obsession, an activity that resembles less the careful reasoning of the conference room than the frenzied betting of the race track.
"There's a kind of casino mentality," said Diahann L. Brown, a vice president at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. "I would say it really became so this year. But I would say you saw a new kind of investor who came into the market this year, secretaries, hairdressers, people not earning lots on the market."
The market debacle has cast a cloud over Hong Kong's economy and shaken public faith in the leadership installed by Beijing. On Tuesday, Tung Chee-hwa, the shipping magnate appointed to administer the territory when China took control in July, summoned officials for an emergency meeting and afterward sought to reassure investors.
"The market still goes up and down," he told reporters. "What has happened this morning was a reaction of what happened around the world, particularly in New York, and from our side we don't see any panic. The fundamentals here are very good, the economy is going well in Hong Kong and the economy in China is going very well."
For much of the Hong Kong population, though, those words rang hollow. Most analysts agree that the Hong Kong economy is sound; the problem is not inflation or weak consumer demand but the Hong Kong Government's determination to defend the Hong Kong dollar at all costs, a policy that has pushed up interest rates and depressed stocks.
The dogged defense of the currency has not only eroded small investors' nest eggs; it has also thrown into question their hopes of buying a home. Fully half of Hong Kong's citizens live in subsidized Government apartments, but Mr. Tung has said he wants 70 percent of the population to own their homes by early in the next century. That will be harder to accomplish if investors' savings evaporate and mortgage rates go up, as they have been doing lately.
On the other hand, some analysts see a silver lining in the current turmoil -- sky-high housing prices might become more affordable. "What is happening in the stock market definitely has some impact on the property market," said Swavi Cheng, a broker who was waiting for customers at the Centaline Property Agency. "We're seeing fewer speculators in the market. A lot of them have money tied up in the stock market."
Nonetheless, she said, "end-users are still coming to us to look at flats; they're hoping prices will come down as more pressure is put on the market."
The question of where the Hong Kong market, and indeed all the markets in Asia, will go next continues to evoke a mixture of concern and confusion among economists and analysts here.
"I'm not quite sure I can offer any sensible insight," Miron Mushkat, the chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region for Lehman Brothers, said on Tuesday.
"There was some bargain hunting last Friday," when the market climbed more than 700 points in an effort to regain some of the ground lost last week, he said, adding, however, that "others saw this happening and sold."
"The market is trying to find a level that is consistent with economic and financial realities," he said. "No one can fully understand what these realities are."
Richard Margolis, a senior vice president at Merrill Lynch & Compnay, said that despite the mayhem visited on the Hong Kong market, the regulatory and oversight mechanisms put in place after the crash of 1987 would insure that Hong Kong weathered the current crisis.
"So far what we've had this time is asset values taking a pretty severe whacking," he said. "But institutionally, Hong Kong is rock solid, which is a sign that the lessons of the past have been learned. The infrastructures of the marketplace and the supervision and regulation have changed all out of recognition. And again, China has done what anybody would have asked, which is nothing. Which is to say, this is for Hong Kong to sort out by itself."
Even so, Mr. Margolis conceded, "we'll have to go through a difficult period for a year or two, but we've lived through this in the past; we'll live through this one."

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Exploiting the Fame of Times Square

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
On the fringes of Times Square, at 48th Street and Seventh Avenue, there is a rooftop billboard that most passers-by find more confusing than promotional. It displays the number 999 in large figures; below that is the word "pharmaceutical" and four Chinese characters across the bottom.
The company that is paying as much as $25,000 a month to lease the sign is a Chinese company whose name is 999 Pharmaceutical. But anyone with an urge to try some 999 products is bound for frustration. None are sold in this country. 
 So why a sign advertising an unobtainable brand's name to people who can't read the message?
"There are very few venues that are global, but one of them is Times Square," said Wei-Tai Kwok, managing director of Dae Advertising, the San Francisco agency that developed and arranged to place the sign. "With all the tourists coming to Times Square and taking pictures, the sign is a way to target the global customer. They are not trying to promote individual products."
Other advertising executives, and real estate specialists, say the sign is an indication of the growing recognition of Times Square's value as a tourist mecca and a place the whole world looks to on New Year's Eve, when the ball drops on the top of the building at One Times Square to signal the arrival of the new year.
Jeffrey Katz, the president of Sherwood Equities, was one of the first to recognize the sharply increasing value of signs in a Times Square that is being transformed from a seedy home to pornography to a glittery entertainment zone with new cinemas and stages and names like Disney and Warner Brothers. Mr. Katz owns the building at the north end of the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, known as 2 Times Square, and the adjacent 1600 Broadway.
He was also an investor in One Times Square at the south end, recognizing that while the narrow tower was no longer suitable as an office building, it was wonderfully placed as a support structure for signs. The building, which had been purchased by Lehman Brothers a few years ago for $27.5 million, was sold this summer to some German investors known as the Jamestown Group for $110 million, an astounding $1,000 a square foot.
Mr. Katz arranged to lease the first four floors to Warner Brothers for a studio store, like the one on 57th Street. When the renovation is ready, Warner's Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck will be positioned to battle it out with Mickey and Minnie Mouse at the Disney store diagonally across the street.
Mr. Katz echoed Mr. Kwok's comments about the appeal of the location, where 20 million visitors a year take pictures with signs in the backdrop. "The theme is there are very few global formats," he said. "There are no global magazines or television. But Times Square is a global image format."
Although 999 Pharmaceutical is not a big name in the United States, Mr. Kwok pointed out that some Japanese companies, like Sony, that are household names today were little known when Sony put up a sign in Times Square in the early 1960's.
Mr. Katz said Akio Morita, then a top executive of Sony, arranged to put a sign on 1600 Broadway, which towered over the building in front of it. "They stayed there until I poured the 15th floor of 2 Times Square," Mr. Katz said. Sony withdrew after that, because the newer building obscured the sight line from the main part of the square.
Now that the economic value of signs has been recognized -- the ones on One Times Square are estimated to produce $7 million in annual net income -- building owners are in the sign business, renting out space and paying the sign companies a fee.
As recently as 10 years ago, executives say, the sign companies would go to the owner of a rundown building and offer to rent the roof for a modest sum, perhaps $100,000 a year. The owner was happy to get the income, but the sign companies could sometimes lease the signs for four or five times as much.
Now that the value of signs has been realized, some latecomers are getting into the game. One of the few buildings in the area that has gone unadorned except for a movie marquee is 1500 Broadway, between 43d and 44th Streets. But now the framework is being erected for a giant video screen on the seventh floor setback of the building.
"The sign is being built by Rainbowvision and will resemble the Panasonic and Concorde signs," said Orna Shulman, executive vice president of Intertech Corporation, which bought the building in 1995. She said additional signs are being planned for the setback roof and over the doors to the office building.
"The building should have signs and it will," she said. "The effect will be quite fantastic."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE ISSUES;
320,000 Have Left Welfare, but Where Do They Go From Here?

SERIES: RACE FOR CITY HALL: The incumbent's record.

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
In the bleak days of the recession, when Rudolph W. Giuliani first seized the reins of New York City, hundreds of grizzled men nested on the busy streets, dozens of homeless families slept in government offices and 1.1 million people eked out a living on welfare, the highest number since the Great Depression.
Mr. Giuliani promised to put the jobless to work, to take the homeless off the streets and to profoundly reshape the social contract between the city and its poor by offering a helping hand from government only to those willing to help themselves. 
 Four years later, there are 320,000 fewer people on the welfare rolls. Nearly 200,000 welfare recipients have swept streets and cleaned parks in what has become the nation's largest workfare program. The homeless men and women who begged for pennies have greatly decreased, at least in the busy center of town, and some shelters now require work in exchange for beds.
Mr. Giuliani touts these changes, particularly the overhaul of welfare, as "the most important thing we have done." And some policy experts call it one of New York City's most dramatic social transformations.
"It is an enormous change," said Fred Siegel, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. "In the Dinkins years, there was no attempt to come to grips with the cost of dependency to the city, and the cost of dependency to the people caught in it."
But much that was promised has yet to be delivered.
For while Mr. Giuliani revolutionized social policy by eliminating New Yorkers' relatively easy access to benefits, his critics say he has failed to move the jobless into real jobs and the homeless into permanent housing, steps that would enable the poor to complete the journey from dependency to self-sufficiency.
Mr. Giuliani, who has not created a successful job placement program, has moved only a tiny proportion of all workfare participants into permanent jobs, according to data that the city reports to the state.
And while he often points to the declining welfare rolls as proof that people are finding work, the Mayor has chosen not to track what happens to those who lose their government checks.
Meanwhile, dozens of homeless families still sleep on the floors of government offices each night, and thousands more have been turned away. In 1994, the city rejected only three families seeking emergency shelter, city statistics show. In 1997, the number was 7,747, under a new city program intended to weed out families whom the Mayor contends are not really homeless.
Homeless adults have been swept from Manhattan's busy streets, but their numbers in city shelters have surged by 15 percent over the last two years, to 7,119 on an average night. It is the first increase since 1990 and it results, in part, from the city's failure to develop enough affordable, permanent housing.
"They have made considerable progress, but they still have a long way to go," said William J. Grinker, a former commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration who advised Mr. Giuliani on social issues during the 1993 mayoral campaign.
"It's one thing to create a workfare program, but it's another thing to get people into real work," Mr. Grinker said. "And in terms of a comprehensive employment strategy, in terms of strategies to reduce long-term homelessness, I haven't seen that kind of planning yet."
Mr. Giuliani's aides say the city is moving in that direction. After reducing city spending on housing programs for homeless adults, the administration now hopes to get state money to create new permanent housing. Mr. Giuliani also plans to spend $7.5 million on a new program that will reward contract agencies that help workfare participants find and keep jobs. And the city hopes to expand its role as a quasi-employment agency, screening and training welfare recipients for work in big companies like Macy's.
"I think you will see an expansion of these programs," said Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser to the Mayor.
But Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Coles also say the decline in the welfare rolls and the creation of the nation's largest workfare program are tremendous accomplishments in and of themselves.
"I think that's as big a change in thinking as the reduction in crime," Mr. Giuliani said in an interview last week. "And I think it has as much of an impact. What I see us doing is re-establishing the centrality of work as an important experience in people's lives."
Mr. Giuliani, who slashed spending on child welfare during the first two years of his term, also claims credit for altering the long-beleaguered child welfare system.
After a series of blunders by city child welfare workers contributed to the beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo in 1995, Mr. Giuliani created New York City's first stand-alone agency for children, the Administration for Children's Services. And he appointed Nicholas Scoppetta, a well-regarded former prosecutor and an advocate for children, to lead it in January 1996.
Since then, Mr. Scoppetta has hired 1,000 new caseworkers, pushed the average caseload down from 20 to 14 per worker and expanded employee training to 10 months from 4 weeks. And he has won high marks for an ambitious and detailed plan to transform the city's management of endangered children.
But change has come slowly. A court-ordered panel of child welfare specialists, which assessed the agency between July 1996 and March 1997, found an agency in grave disarray. In the panel's most recent report, issued last week, 43 percent of the abused and neglected children who were left in their homes under the watch of city caseworkers were found to have been mistreated again by their caretakers. And caseworkers closed 30 percent of their investigations prematurely, leaving children unnecessarily endangered, the panel found.
The number of children in foster care, which had been declining, surged to 11,158 in 1997, a 40 percent increase over 1995, as caseworkers pulled children from troubled homes more aggressively. Unprepared for the deluge, city officials found themselves short of beds and sometimes forced to house children overnight in city offices.
This summer, Mr. Scoppetta managed to win financing for new beds in group homes, many of which had closed in previous years because of city and state budget cuts. And he said his agency was improving.
"It's a better agency today than it was," Mr. Scoppetta said. "It's going to take some years before we reap the benefits of this investment."
But policy experts warn that the coming years will pose even greater challenges as thousands of welfare recipients lose their benefits under new state and federal laws. Many experts in social services fear this situation will strain the child welfare system and homeless shelters. By the end of next year, for instance, 179,000 single adults on welfare will lose their benefits under state law.
Will New York City have a successful job placement program by then? Will there be enough jobs in the private sector? Will the ranks of the homeless swell and will there be places for them go?
"It's an enormous task," said Liz Krueger, the associate director of the Community Food Resource Center, a non-profit group that acts as an advocate for the poor. "Right now, we're not ready."
Future articles will examine Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's record on the city's budget and economy and Ruth W. Messinger's record as Manhattan Borough President and as Councilwoman.

HEADLINE: This Time, a Market Slump Would Differ in Its Effects

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
For a long string of years, most New Yorkers did not need to think much about Wall Street and the stock market as prices climbed with seemingly inexorable stability.
But the tumult of the last week has brought it all back into focus -- both how much the industry remains a force in the New York economy and how much it remains a mystery. On Monday, there were people facing co-op boards with suddenly heightened timidity because their net worth had declined by 20 percent, and home buyers, shopping for mortgages, who watched interest rates seesaw with the stock market. 
 The city has changed since its last market crucible in 1987 and so has the market. With prices plummeting one day and soaring the next, the market's role in the city economy is unquestionably back on the minds of residents and politicians no matter what happens next. The era of complacency is over.
Economists and securities industry officials say that New York is the stock market's unquestioned national capital as much as a decade ago but that what the city draws from the relationship is not the same.
The city, in short, has fewer jobs and more money. It is less a captive of the industry's employment rhythms and more a slave to its profits. That means the impact of a downturn in the market, or even a period of prolonged turmoil, would take a much different form than it did in 1987.
Mass layoffs in New York would probably be less likely than in 1987, for example, because the job base has increasingly been shifted out of New York -- to the nation, the world and the rest of the region. The kinds of jobs that the industry has added in the city in recent years, especially the high-technology positions required to run the increasingly elaborate and automated trading systems, are also considered more stable, given the dominance of computer trading.
Other parts of the local economy are also healthier than they were a decade ago. Because there has been little new commercial office construction, there is no vast pool of space that would drag the economy down, as was the case after the 1987 crash. State and local governments have also become more efficient, economists say, and thus less likely to drag down the economy through layoffs.
"The city is in a much better position to weather a storm," said Rae Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "It's not that it wouldn't be painful, but that we're simply in a better position to withstand it."
Countering the story on jobs, however, is the much harder to predict question of Wall Street's money. The impact of a decline in bonuses and salaries would ripple through the economy with more force than it ever did in the past. Industry salaries accounted for 12.8 percent of the total private sector payroll in the city in 1987. Today, Wall Street salaries are sharply higher than a decade ago. And even though there are slightly fewer securities jobs in the city, those that remain account for 17.8 percent of the money earned in the city's private-sector economy.
"The key contribution of Wall Street now is the income and the earnings -- that's a shift from what happened in the 1980's," said John L. Wieting, the New York Regional Commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Then it was a major force in job growth."
That flow of bonuses and salaries affects everything from residential real estate to car sales, and while few experts were predicting any change in the flow of that money, there were a few anecdotal signs that at least a period of momentary monetary caution may have arrived.
One media analyst for Bear Stearns, who was looking in the $900,000 range for a six-room apartment on the Upper West Side on Monday morning, called his real state broker that afternoon and said he wanted to downscale.
Barbara Corcoran, the chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, said the analyst told her he had decided to keep his purchase at about $500,000. "He was very clear on what he wanted in the morning and by afternoon, he had reassessed," she said. "It was a direct response to the market."
Kevin J. Pallonetti, 30, who owns an electronic parts distributorship in Great Neck, N.Y., and is in contract to buy a town house with his wife, said he called his mortgage broker six times on Monday morning. His hunch was that interest rates would drop and that if he moved quickly he could lock in a lower rate for his mortgage. Mr. Pallonetti is still waiting, betting rates will go lower.
The securities industry's role in the region has changed. A decade ago, for example, New York State had about 38 percent of all the nation's jobs in the industry. Today, it has about 28 percent. Total employment in the industry in New York City -- about 154,000 jobs as of September, according to the Federal figures -- is slightly lower than a decade ago, though it is up sharply from the bottom of 129,000 jobs in 1991.
But employment elsewhere has soared. Securities jobs in New Jersey, for example, have doubled in the last 10 years, to nearly 33,000.
Industry experts said they believed Wall Street has also deliberately changed in part to try to avoid the thousands of layoffs that occurred in the early 1990's.
"Nobody wants to work in an environment where you're vulnerable to those kinds of swings, and no institution wants to lay off," said Rocco J. Maggiotto, chairman of the securities industry practice at Coopers & Lybrand. "Most major firms made significant investments in back office functions so that their cost of executing trades was significantly reduced. If another downturn did occur, they would not need layoffs."

HEADLINE: What to Make of Wave That Started Over There;
U.S. Businesses Can Shrug Off Asian Tumult

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
When currencies and stocks in Hong Kong -- or Thailand or Indonesia -- take a tumble, must America feel their pain?
Sure, the deepening financial woes in Asia and, more particularly, the spread of the problem to Hong Kong, China's monument to global capitalism, clearly prompted the big drop Monday on Wall Street. 
 "Irrational exuberance gave way to irrational gloom," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
But for all the increasing interconnectedness of global markets, many observers say that the linkage between Asia's economic prospects and the profitability of American companies is not strong enough to justify the trillion-dollar loss in stock values in a week.
"All of us have been guilty of exaggerating the importance of Asia as the driving force behind the world economy," argued Peter Kenen, an economist at Princeton University.
Indeed, the rebound yesterday on Wall Street, in which the Dow Jones industrial average rose 337 points, appeared to reflect some serious second thoughts about just how the dire the situation for American business really is.
While Asia's problems, to some extent, will cause a number of big American corporations to face lower exports, more import competition and diminished returns on foreign investments, the size of those changes simply does not justify a fundamental shift in outlook. In fact, some countervailing forces work to keep the American economy on the prosperity track.
Hard times in Asia "will likely impede U.S. growth only modestly," concluded Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs who has been bullish for much of the 1990's. "At the same time, the inflation and interest rate backdrop has become more favorable."
John Maynard Keynes compared the stock market to a beauty pageant in which the winner is not the woman the majority thinks is most attractive but the woman most people think that others will find most attractive. From this perspective, it should hardly be a surprise that fears that a collapse of the currencies in Southeast Asia would lead to a selloff of American stocks proved to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
That said, virtually all analysts agree that in the long run the price of stocks turns on the more tangible question of expected earnings per share down the road. And while Asia's economic predicament is, on balance, bad news for globally minded American enterprises, it hardly presents a serious obstacle to continuing growth in profits for corporate America.
Start with import competition. The sharp depreciation of Southeast Asian currencies in the last three months is already beginning to show up as an increase in Asia's volume of exports. But Southeast Asia largely competes in world markets with low-wage countries like Brazil, China and Mexico -- not with California, Michigan and Texas.
Albert Fishlow, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, notes that some American companies stand to reap a windfall from Asian currency depreciation, since the prices of imported components for their own products -- computer memory chips, for example -- are likely to fall in coming months. Others American companies will benefit because they use Southeast Asia as an export platform to Europe, Japan and North America. "While local sales by foreign subsidiaries may be hit by recession in Asia, increased exports could more than offset the loss," he said.
Recession in Southeast Asia means these countries will buy fewer 747's from Boeing, fewer videos from Disney and fewer bushels of soybeans from Illinois. But once again, the magnitude has not been put into perspective. American exports to the countries in the deepest trouble -- Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and the Philippines -- amounted to just $30 billion in the first eight months of this year, less collectively than exports to Canada, Japan or the European Community individually.
And some of the nation's largest consumer products companies say the turmoil in the Asian markets will have little effect on their businesses.
The companies, including Procter & Gamble, Gillette and Colgate-Palmolive, say Asia represents less than 10 percent of their sales, which minimizes their vulnerability to wild market swings and declines in consumer demands that might follow currency devaluations.
To Colgate, for example, Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, represents just "5 percent of our sales, and the populations of those countries represent a small portion of all the countries we serve," said Robert A. Murray, a Colgate spokesman. A number of companies questioned said they had also taken actions in the currency markets to hedge against the risk of wide fluctuations.
Moreover, the $8 trillion United States economy is so substantial and diversified that weakness in any region of the world is not enough to divert it significantly from its path. "Slow growth in Japan since 1991 has hardly put the brakes on Wall Street or the American economy," Mr. Fishlow said.
If the potential for collateral damage from a recession in Southeast Asia has been exaggerated, the potential for indirect gains has been all but ignored. One reason American business has enjoyed seven fat years is that growth in much of the world has been tepid. For while slow growth abroad dulls America's export performance, it also prevents the sorts of production bottlenecks that lead to inflation -- and recession.
World commodity prices, measured in dollars, are virtually unchanged from 1990 levels. In the last year, crude oil prices have actually fallen by 20 percent, rubber prices by 32 percent and timber prices by 27 percent. Moreover, with both Japan and Europe running in slow motion, America's huge appetite for manufactured goods has been easily satisfied by foreign producers. And with growing excess production capacity in Southeast Asia as well, more signs point to deflation than to inflation.
By the same token, economic trauma in Asia reduces the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates anytime soon. With Hong Kong's once rock-solid currency under pressure, Latin America deeply worried about contagion and stock markets around the world still on edge, the Fed will be in no mood to tighten money. "They aren't going to add fuel to the fire," Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said.
None of this guarantees that investors will ignore all that has happened in the last week, say "never mind" and simply pump Wall Street back to record highs, the way they did relatively quickly after the crash of 1987. It does suggest, though, that Asia's trauma will hardly be felt by most Americans. "Globalization matters," Mr. Kenen concluded, "but less than people think."

Mounting financial and currency problems in several Southeast Asian countries set off a string of events that led to a broad selloff in American markets. Jittery investors worried that American business would be hurt by a downturn in the region. But Southeast Asia, while among the fastest growing regions anywhere, still accounts for only a small fraction of total U.S. trade and economic activity.

HEADLINE: UAL and T.W.A. Report Improvements in Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation and Trans World Airlines Inc. reported improved third-quarter earnings today, capping a robust quarter for the airline industry as more travelers paid higher fares and the companies cut costs.
Earnings at UAL, the parent of Chicago-based United Airlines, rose 5.3 percent, aided by a surge in September travel and lower fuel costs. St. Louis-based Trans World Airlines reported its first profitable quarter since the crash of Flight 800 in July 1996, as the company flew smaller planes and cut operating costs. 
 The third quarter is typically the most profitable period for airlines as travel increases for summer vacations. The airlines also received a lift from a 5 percent increase in business fares at the beginning of September.
"We are encouraged by September's revenue strength, and unless the recent stock market volatility and uncertainty disrupts the general economy, we expect this strength to continue into the fourth quarter," said Gerald Greenwald, chairman and chief executive of UAL.
Earlier this month, the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines; Continental Airlines Inc. and the Northwest Airlines Corporation all posted profit gains of 13 percent to 15 percent, while profits soared 52 percent at the Southwest Airlines Company and 72 percent at US Airways Group Inc. Earnings at Delta Air Lines Inc. rose 6.8 percent. All exceeded analysts' estimates.
Using pro-forma calculations to reflect employee stock-option plan distributions, UAL's profit before special items rose to $499 million, or $3.75 a share, up from $474 million, or $3.58 a share, a year earlier.
The results beat analysts' expectations of $3.68 a share. The company's shares rose $1.375, to $87.50, on the New York Stock Exchange today.
A gain of $235 million, reflecting the sale of Apollo Travel Services to Galileo International, resulted in net income in the latest quarter of $734 million, or $5.52 a fully distributed share. A year earlier, charges of $38 million resulted in net income of $437 million, or $3.29 a share.
The company, majority-owned by its employees, says fully distributed earnings are the best measure of its results.
Revenue rose 3.3 percent, to $4.64 billion, from $4.49 billion.
T.W.A. reported third-quarter profit from operations of $13.3 million, or 17 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $6.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Per-share amounts reflect the payment of preferred stock dividends. Revenue fell 9.4 percent, to $908.4 million, from $1 billion a year earlier.
After charges of $6.99 million in the most recent quarter and $7.42 million a year earlier, T.W.A. had net income of $2.42 million, or 4 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $18.2 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. T.W.A.'s shares rose 37.5cents, to $7.3125.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: THE CHINESE-AMERICANS;
Pride and Censure Mix With a Dash of Apathy

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
If President Jiang Zemin of China studies the official receptions here this week and the disparate throngs protesting or quietly watching beyond, he will be able to sample a range of Chinese-American concerns as wide as China itself.
Kung-Lee Wang, an economist and business consultant who co-founded the influential Committee of 100 Chinese-American leaders, says he will be at the reception for President Jiang on Wednesday because he yearns to see a fuller opening of China's vast economic and cultural marketplace to America. 
 "We are not there," Mr. Wang warned. "The Europeans and the Japanese are there." Counseling creative patience on human rights matters, he said, "I would not let that one issue become the veto issue."
But half a block from Mr. Jiang's meeting with Mr. Wang and 30 other local Chinese-American leaders at Blair House, vocal dissidents will mass in Lafayette Park to focus on human rights, not economic opportunity, as the prime issue of the China leader's visit with President Clinton.
"We have been stripped of our nationality and forced to become stateless international refugees," Liu Binyan, a celebrated victim of Beijing's intolerance, said on the eve of a protest that will echo with the grievances of the brutal crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy protest eight years ago.
Daphne Kwok is one Chinese-American activist who will be studiously ignoring human rights and economic issues as her focal point. "I'm monitoring how the visit may or may not play into the campaign finance issue," said Ms. Kwok, devoted in her role as director of the Organization of Chinese Americans.
She says her group has 10,000 members and a sense of absolute outrage at the "systematic stereotyping" of Asian-American citizens in the investigations into alleged political fund-raising abuses by foreign-born donors.
"This is the real issue for Chinese-Americans," she said. "Here we are in 1997 with a major feeling, tolerated among the American public, that it is O.K. to make fun and stereotype Americans who have Chinese features."
Darting somewhere between Blair House and the park protest will be Norman Fu, United States correspondent for China Times, a Taiwan newspaper, taking notes as a reporter fascinated by President Jiang's presence here as "a paradoxical figure" who has had a classical education but a "callous" rise to power.
"What is no less interesting is my impression that there may be more Americans than Chinese-Americans opposed to his visit because of the human rights issue."
Beyond these individuals, the mood among the 1.7 million Americans of Chinese ancestry about President Jiang's arrival can be found ranging from the blase to the prideful.
"I'm kind of ambivalent," said Wu-Lang Lee, a Federal economist unstirred by the media drumbeat.
"It's a routine matter to me," said Mr. Lee, a Taiwan-born American who cares deeply about the security of Taiwan but expects President Clinton to win no great reassurances in that regard.
And pride? Shu-Ping Chan, a community relations specialist with the government of Maryland, insisted: "Listen, even among my friends who work for the Taiwan Government I'm finding political differences put aside. There's a bit of lingering pride that the Chinese Government is being recognized as a coequal. This is a chance for China to shine -- that's what I'm sensing."
Studying these facets and more, American scholars like Marshall Bouton, vice president of the Asia Society, find Chinese-Americans feeling "whipsawed," as he put it, by the Chinese leader's visit. There is a distinct sense of welcome, but wariness, too, that the visit might somehow redound negatively on them by feeding controversies like the foreign-money campaign inquiry.
"The visit is and ought to be a very welcome development in putting U.S-China relations back on an even keel after the very traumatic Tiananmen events," Mr. Bouton said. "Many in the community felt the trauma personally. But there was also that sort of shudder, if you will, at the tendency in our history for the Chinese community to be victimized when state relations turn sour."
Just a mile from all the toasting and protesting about President Jiang, Duane Wang, Shanghai-born and an American for four decades, intends to stay busy all week at his lumberyard in Washington's Chinatown.
"It all depends on where you're from and when you got here," was his summary of Chinese-American views. "I speak as an American. I find the visit a good thing because China is a very old country, and since Nixon opened it up, it has changed tremendously, even in human rights."
"Think of it this way: if it hadn't been opened up, there would have been no Tiananmen Square," said Mr. Wang, his faith in time and China strong. "President Jiang will learn. He will find out our system is good, and he will go home with a different attitude."
Others are not so sure.
"Personally, I think business will be foremost with President Clinton in the visit, not human rights, and I don't agree with that," said the Rev. Samuel Yau, pastor of the Chinese Christian Church of Greater Washington, which serves 350 Americans from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in nearby Silver Spring, Md.
Mr. Yau finds no special discussion or protest this week among his hard-working parishioners. He speaks of the campaign inquiry issue not as an outraged Chinese-American, but as as an American with faith in the political system. "I don't worry about the fund-raising charges," he said. "The system is very much stable in our country."
G. Greg Chen, a worker here in the Mayor's office, earns his living tracking and celebrating the grand disparity of views about China within Chinatown, but also fathoming the relative ignorance of non-Chinese Americans about his birthplace. He hopes the visit will ease both the simplistic "Communist dragon" image of China and local anxiety over racist stereotyping.
"We have lots of people contributing to their new country," Mr. Chen said. "You cannot treat Asian-Americans this way."

HEADLINE: So Far, a New Crop of Investors Refuse to Budge

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Nearly panicking as the stock market dived after today's opening bell, Jan Balou, a saleswoman in her 40's, dashed to the Michigan Avenue bus, and headed for her Charles Schwab brokerage office, ready to unload her investments.
Feeling frantic, she asked almost everyone on the bus -- and later on the sidewalk -- if Wall Street, long the toast of the town, was now just toast. She found not a Chicken Little in the bunch. 
 So, after all that, Ms. Balou decided to buy more stocks.
"Everybody else said, 'I'm hanging in,' " she said, "so I'm going to hang in, too."
For all the fretting about whether the new crop of investors could withstand a major downturn without scurrying back to their savings passbooks, the ordinary Joes and Janes like Ms. Balou refused to fold their cards today after Monday's Wall Street plunge.
Only time will tell, of course, whether that will turn out to be a smart move.
After watching the market drop more than 7 percent on Monday, and then sink lower this morning, 49-year-old Dalia Ratner said to herself, "Hmm, looks like a good day to buy more stocks."
Judging from dozens of interviews in Atlanta and Boston, in Los Angeles and Denver, in Chicago and Hicksville, N.Y., investors generally remain strongly bullish, and well schooled about the dynamics of the market.
With almost everybody and her sister invested in Wall Street, the stock market seems to have become a new national pastime, as people break the ice by talking about the Dow, instead of the ball game.
Indeed, old cliches like "playing them one at a time," and "giving 110 percent," seem to have given way to, "the underlying fundamentals are excellent," and "great buying opportunity."
Investors like Andrew Jaramillo, 27, who runs a flower market in Los Angles, were shrewdly looking for bargains today. As he stood in front of a stock quote computer, his biggest disappointment, in fact, was that the market did not stay down for a longer period.
"This morning we were going to buy Dell Computer at $70, but we just couldn't get on the phone," he said. "By the time we got on, it was already $86."
 Craig Holm, a 43-year-old health consultant from Philadelphia, sat in the Second Street Cafe in Brooklyn, analyzing the stock market and global politics, sounding a bit like Louis Rukeyser.
"Even if the Far East economies stumble," said Mr. Holm, "our economy is still strong" enough to ward off a terrible plunge in the market.
Dave Elliott, a Chicago construction worker in a hard hat, broke into a broad smile at the news that the market had soared today.
"I don't play the market, I invest for the long term," said Mr. Elliott, who checks his mutual fund on the Internet. "But it's nice to hear it's coming back."
And plenty of investors, especially the more prosperous ones, noted that the market has been so good for so long, that to pout about a downturn would sound a bit like a spoiled child.
Joy Cash, a 62-year-old psychotherapist in Denver, said she lost thousands of dollars in retirement funds on Monday, about the same amount she had made so far this year.
Some people were thrilled to see the market take a tumble on Monday.
Figuring that the stock market could not soar forever, Larry Williamson, 41, recently bought a boatload of puts, which make money when the market falls.
"I feel great, man, just great," he said early this morning, in a position to reap thousands of dollars. If the market recovers completely, of course, he is out of luck.
For all the talk about high finances in the go-go 90's, there still are many Americans who do not have a dime riding on the crap tables of Wall Street, and harbor a little resentment over any tears shed for the investors, especially the ones in fancy threads.
"When you live from check to check, like a lot of us, you don't have anything to put on the stock market," said Cecilia Moon, 40, who lives in a basement apartment in Chicago and checks parking meters for a living.
"A lot of these big-shot investors have been riding the gravy train," Ms. Moon said. "And then, if they lost a little, they'll get to write it off on their taxes."
Others without investments were happy to be free of the anxieties of the stock market.
"When something fluctuates so much, it makes me nervous," said John Obih, 45, who operates a roadside yard sale under a tent in Los Angeles.
"If you go to a store, you see the money. If you go to a house, you see it standing up," he added. "In the stock market, it is only a piece of paper. There is nothing to show for your money."
Inside the chapel at St. Paul's Bookstore in Chicago, visitors write down their worries, asking others to pray for them.
The list is usually full of concerns for sick children, a sense of loneliness or despair, a crisis in faith. In the last two days, plenty of people have been asking for prayers for the stock market.
Sister Tracey Duggs, a 25-year-old Roman Catholic nun at the store, who has taken a vow of poverty, said there are bigger concerns in life than the Dow Jones industrial average. But she is not beyond empathizing with some secular worries.
"My dad," she said, with a hint of concern, "likes to dabble in the market."
These market worries seem like small potatoes to David Wald, a retired lawyer, who remembers the stock market crash of 1929. He even saw a bright side to the market jitters.
"This is fun, you know, creating some action, stirring people up," he said, noting the buzz caused by the market's gyrations. "And what do I care, I'm 81 years old. What do I need money for?"
When Mr. Wald mentioned that he had long ago learned "an important secret about investing," several younger men and women drew near the oracle, listening for sage advice.
"Never listen to anybody," he declared. "They don't know what they're talking about."

HEADLINE: Debating Whether Crisis Had to Be

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28

 BODY:
The financial tumult that built speed in Southeast Asia and then repeatedly raced around the globe raises a question that few finance ministries around the world want to address: Could someone -- maybe the United States, maybe Japan -- have taken the lead early enough to stop a selloff from becoming a crisis?
Months ago, American officials, led by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, decided that there would be no Mexican-style bailout of the ailing Asian markets. After all, it is not in America's backyard. Financial turmoil in Asia is unlikely to affect the American economy significantly. Besides, the prescription for economic recovery is not clear. And most important, there is the risk that any quick fix by the United States might do more harm than good. 
 If the world became dependent on the world's economic superpower to bail countries out of every financial crisis, Mr. Rubin has said repeatedly, that might simply open the door to even more crises in the future.
In the last few weeks, however, American officials have begun to edge toward more active involvement, spurred by signs that a "contagion effect" from Asian markets to the rest of the world was taking hold. Today, at the Treasury and the White House, officials said there was discussion of taking a more public role in the International Monetary Fund's impending bailout of Indonesia -- including American participation in emergency back-up financing in case the I.M.F.'s program proves insufficient. It is the clearest evidence yet that the Administration is concerned that its influence in Asia could be harmed if Washington fails to take a more active role.
And while they will not discuss it publicly, American officials appear poised to act more forcefully. But late today, they were clearly hoping the market's rebound would make that unnecessary. "We feel a lot smarter this afternoon," one Administration official said, with an eye to Wall Street's 337-point rebound, "than we did this time yesterday."
But Mr. Rubin's calculations -- a weighing of the short-term benefits of calming world markets against the long-term costs of making America the world's financial savior of last resort -- are hardly over.
Indeed, in some ways the financial problems in Asia are now significantly larger. And American officials say they know they face the financial corollary of the Powell Doctrine during the Persian Gulf war: If the United States decides to shore up investor confidence, it may have to do so with such overwhelming force that the opposition would be overwhelmed.
"Rubin's facing an excrutiating choice," said Jeffrey Garten, a former Under Secretary of Commerce and author of a book about emerging markets. "If we can make it through this period without American intervention, it will force the economies of Southeast Asia to make very fundamental reforms. That is clearly the preferable course. But if we can't make it through, my guess is that other options have to be very much alive."
The Administration is benefiting from one of the realities of economic diplomacy: Unlike nuclear arms talks or negotiations in Bosnia, financial crises are considered so arcane that they produce little Congressional sniping -- as long as no taxpayer dollars are at risk.
"I wouldn't be inclined at this time to be critical of Secretary Rubin or anybody else for what they did or didn't do," the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said today. "I don't know what I would have expected."
At the heart of the Administration's strategy, officials said, are two guiding principles.
The first is that no country should receive help from the I.M.F. or other international institutions without first agreeing to comprehensive changes. Among those are painful austerity measures and actions that assure that banks that made bad loans or investors who made bad decisions "take a haircut" -- that is, lose substantial sums. Otherwise, calling in the I.M.F. will seem like an easy out to countries that overspend, overborrow and overbuild.
The second guideline has been to dispel the Mexico effect: make it clear that the United States is not in the business of providing direct help to countries that get in trouble.
"Our strategy has been to be activist and concerned," one senior Administration official said today, "but to know where the line is."
The question, on Wall Street and to a lesser degree in Washington, is whether that line should have moved as the crisis deepened.
"The official approach so far has been too little, too late," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "The initial policy line in Thailand -- urging countries to adjust their policies, working with the I.M.F. and the World Bank -- was appropriate at the time." But that strategy, he said, should have been revisited "once it became clear that it was not halting a further spiraling of the Asian crisis."
Both Mr. Lipsky and C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, say the key turning point came on Oct. 17, when Taiwan -- apparently under little or no pressure from speculators -- devalued its currency so that its goods would be competitive with those of Indonesia and Thailand.
"That was a moment the U.S. and other major economies needed to exercise some influence," Mr. Bergsten said. The next week, the speculators turned to Hong Kong -- Taiwan's most direct trade competitor.
Administration officials say they do not remember any high-level discussion of intervention, public or private, after Taiwan's sudden decision to devalue its currency. It is unclear whether the United States would have had the influence to reverse that decision, even if it had tried. But Treasury officials reject the suggestion that the Administration has been too timid in its statements.
Meanwhile, some in the Administration have been critical of the International Monetary Fund for what American officials say has amounted to mindless cheerleading for Thailand and other Asian nations, repeatedly declaring that stability was just around the corner.
But while today's resurgence in the American market may calm Asia, some critics remain convinced that the Clinton Administration could have acted more forcefully without turning itself into a bailout specialist. "This was not an issue of money, it was one of clarity of policy," Mr. Lipsky said. "There were moments where more could have been done."

To about 2,000 employees in the lobby of Lucent Technologies in Holmdel yesterday. 
 "I can't come before a group like this and not be blatantly political. I would like your votes on Nov. 4. But what I want you to do is I want you to support the people who have been making a difference in the state of New Jersey, and that's the people who have been in Trenton with me these last three-and-a-half years. Because we have made a commitment to you. We made a commitment, we said we would solve problems four years ago. We've been solving those problems, we've got more to work on, and believe me we will. We'll get property taxes, and we'll get auto insurance rates down, because we are committed to seeing that happen."

"All of New Jersey needs to recognize that not only is there a moral responsibility, but there are practical reasons to provide for economic development and job growth within our cities. We have a fundamental choice: either to attract private capital for job growth and economic development or to condemn our cities to neglect, where the loss would be far greater in the loss of potential human capital and productivity. The pastors of this state are already doing the hard work. They require a governor who will work in partnership, who will work in partnership to continue to provide opportunity."

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE -- STOCKS RALLY ON RECORD VOLUME AS SMALL INVESTORS TAKE LEAD;
Wall Street Sets the Tone

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Panic on Wall Street spread around the world, but was halted yesterday where it had been the most intense just a day earlier -- in America. For better or worse, the United States is now setting the tone for world stock markets.
Whether the buyers or the sellers yesterday will ultimately prove to have been the wiser investors will not be known for some time. But it is clear that the impact on world markets was intensified by American stock market rules that were aimed at minimizing market swings. Those rules may have helped bring in buyers yesterday, but the cost to world markets was significant. 
 First came the panic. Most world stock markets plunged further and faster early yesterday than they had at any time in recent years. The cause clearly was alarm over the previous day's declines in New York. Because rules had cut off trading on Monday after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 550 points, there was no way to determine just how far prices would have plunged in New York if stocks had been allowed to trade freely.
Then came the turnaround yesterday. Prices opened lower in New York, but rebounded after less than an hour. European markets that were still open turned on a dime, bouncing back from their deepest losses earlier in the day. It was not that there was suddenly better news on the prospects for European companies and economies. It was the reassurance provided by the largest and most important stock market.
And who had turned around that market? No data are available on who really buys and sells stocks. But computers that monitor trading can reach some conclusions. And those computers, reports Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm, indicate that it was smaller orders, of fewer than 10,000 shares, that provided all of the market's power. The bigger orders were generally negative for most of the day. Virtually all the bigger orders came from institutional investors, like pension funds and mutual funds. Some of the smaller ones did too, of course. But many of them came from ordinary investors.
Economic theory may assert that investors weigh each stock and then pick the most attractive one, but in practice money managers often follow the herd. They buy things that are going up, and they sell things that are going down, in each case assuming that there are likely to be good reasons for the moves, even if they are not immediately obvious. For now, it appears that Main Street was more willing to believe the old trend -- of prices that rise year after year -- than the new one that manifested itself in the last week.
Last week, when a plunge in Hong Kong set off international alarms, the New York market was a bastion of relative strength. Early in the week, American shares rose despite Asian weakness. And even on Thursday and Friday, when prices fell sharply in this country, the declines were not as great as in most foreign markets.
But on Monday, New York did worse than most markets and was forced to close early when a so-called circuit breaker kicked in after the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 550 points, or about 7 percent. An earlier circuit breaker had resulted in a half-hour break after the Dow fell 350 points. There are just 30 stocks in the Dow, but the thousands of stocks in all American markets are barred from trading after those 30 plunge the requisite amounts. The data indicate that both large and small orders put downward pressure on the market on Monday.
The rally yesterday can be cited as evidence that circuit breakers work. After American investors had the night to think it over, enough of them were willing to invest to halt the fall in prices not long after the market opened for trading. It appears that individual American investors were less upset than were the professionals who manage their money. Some bought, and fewer sold than mutual fund managers may have expected.
But the intensity of the overseas selling between the time the United States market closed early on Monday and the time it reopened yesterday indicates that those who designed the circuit breakers were wrong in one respect: The market reaction to the closing was not minimized by the fact that it was caused by an existing rule rather than by fearful exchange officials or politicians.
"We were very aware that ad hoc acts of closing the market could cause panic," said Robert Glauber, who was executive director of the Brady Commission, a Government body that studied the 1987 crash and recommended that circuit breakers be put into place. "Circuit breakers were put in place so no one would think anyone had pushed the panic button."
But somebody obviously thought just that, and the results were awesome. Hong Kong, which had started the panic last week by falling 23 percent in four days, fell 13.7 percent yesterday, after Monday's close on Wall Street. Australia was down by 1O percent, New Zealand by 12 percent. Japan fell only 4 percent, but that reflected extraordinary controls that limited how much individual stocks could fall and kept many of them from trading at all. In Europe, Germany and France had each lost more than 10 percent, and Britain more than 7 percent, by the time New York opened.
European markets had mild recoveries earlier in the morning, before 6 A.M. New York time, when the stock index futures on the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, which trade overnight, recovered a bit. But then those futures fell back in the overnight session to the maximum decline allowed, and European markets resumed their drop.
Another factor of international money management is that managers who need to raise cash sometimes choose to sell their most liquid investments -- that is, the ones that can most easily and quickly be unloaded. Liquidity has always been a major strength of the American market, but it vanished for a time on Monday under conditions that made it possible to believe it would not return. That fact could have led some money managers to sell foreign stocks in lieu of American ones they really wanted to sell.
History does not allow trial runs, or controlled tests with placebos given to half the investors. So it will never be known if foreign markets would have suffered as much had the American market been allowed to find its own level on Monday, rather than be closed.
Mr. Glauber, who is now a lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, remains a believer in circuit breakers. But he says they never should have been used this week. "The original design of circuit breakers from the Brady Commission was as strong medicine for a market in distress," he said. "The market was not in distress and it did not need the medicine. I think circuit breakers should be set wider so they trigger only in a disorderly market."
When the circuit breakers were originally adopted, they called for a halt when the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 250 points, and another at 400 points. Those limits amounted to falls of about 12 percent and 20 percent. But on Monday, even though the limits had since been raised to 350 and 550 points, they amounted to only about 4 percent and 7 percent. And, in fact, trading was orderly as the Dow neared that 550-point threshold. Mr. Glauber said the limits should be set at about 10 percent for the first halt, and 15 percent for the second one.
Circuit breakers in the American stock market are, by the way, one-way things. At 3:17 P.M. yesterday, the Dow was up 350 points. If melt-ups worried the rule makers at the Big Board as much as meltdowns do, that would have halted trading for half an hour. Instead, it continued, and prices soon fell back a bit. The Dow ended the day up 337.17 points, or 4.7 percent.
For now, the panic seems to have ended. But the probability is that it would have been less intense, and perhaps would not have been so widespread, if the American rules had been different. Circuit breakers, as they worked on Monday, saved some American investors from making sales at levels that were destined to seem cheap the next day. But they seem to have stimulated a lot more such selling in foreign markets. On balance, they may well have done more harm than good.

HEADLINE: Steady Retirement Money Is Foundation for Rebound

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Monday's stock market plunge may have unnerved some investors, but it did not spook people who save for retirement in 401(k) plans. At least that was what large employers, mutual funds and plan administrators said yesterday.
To be sure, service centers were flooded with calls, but most people were simply checking the value of their accounts. 
 Few people moved money from one investment account to another, casting doubt on a frequently expressed concern on Wall Street -- that novice investors would bolt at the first sign of a downturn.
If they did bolt, it would create quite a ripple. The number of people with 401(k) plans has doubled in a decade, to the point that one worker in five has a 401(k) or similar plan. And fully a quarter of this money is in stock funds.
At the General Electric Company, which has 200,000 people in its 401(k) plan, just 800 moved money from one investment option to another, said Charles E. Welch, a benefits executive. While that was five or six times normal, he said, it still came to just one G.E. worker in 250.
At the General Motors Corporation, where 282,000 salaried and hourly workers have $19 billion in retirement plans, "we did not see a mad dash to sell out," said Tony Simonetti, a spokeswoman.
Fidelity Investment Company, the mutual fund unit of the FMR Corporation, said that its automated system for 401(k) plans received a record 250,000 calls on Monday, up from 150,000 on a typical weekday. The number of callers who wanted to speak to an operator almost doubled, to 78,000, on Monday, said Bob Reynolds, president of Fidelity Institutional Retirement Group.
Rowena Itchon, a spokeswoman for T. Rowe Price, the third-largest mutual fund company in the 401(k) business, said that yesterday morning "we saw modest redemptions out of equity funds into money market funds and some fixed-income funds, but by the end of the day we saw quite a bit of money moving into equity funds."
TIAA-CREF, the largest private retirement fund, with two million participants, also said few people moved money. Calling volume, it said, was 25 percent above normal.
"Some people moved into equities and some out, but not enough that you could draw any inference," said Claire Sheahan, a spokeswoman. "Our participants seem to have gotten the message through our investor education programs that retirement saving is for long-term investors."
Many workers were apparently as nonchalant as Howard Stutz, a public relations executive in Las Vegas, Nev. "I didn't even call to check my balance," said Mr. Stutz, whose clients include several big gambling halls. "I am in a 401(k) for the long haul, so I am just going to leave it. The economy is good, and so I am not that worried."
About 24 million workers participate in 401(k) plans and similar retirement savings plans for nonprofit and government workers, double the number in 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly a quarter of its value in a day.
Last year workers had $810 billion in 401(k) plans, up from $155 billion a decade earlier, according to Access Research Inc., a Stamford, Conn., company that tracks 401(k)'s.
Workers and their employers contributed $69.3 billion to 401(k) plans in 1993, the latest year for which detailed figures were available, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a Washington nonprofit group whose estimates are regarded as authoritative. The trend in 401(k) contributions as tracked by the institute suggests that workers now add to their 401(k) plans at the rate of nearly $2 billion a week, or $100 billion a year.
The inaction by participants Monday and yesterday came even though workers are far more exposed to swings in the stock market today than when the market had its last sizable downturn.
Last year 26 percent of 401(k) money was in diversified stock funds, up from 10 percent in 1990, Access Research estimated, while stable-value funds like guaranteed investment contracts had fallen to 20 percent from 32 percent in 1990.
For long-term investors, stocks have historically provided bigger returns than bonds and much bigger returns than savings accounts and money market funds.
The emphasis on equities in retirement plans is even more pronounced in the new money going in. Last year 59 percent of 401(k) contributions went into stock funds and 11 percent into the stock of the employee's company, Access Research estimated.
What would it take to scare Mr. Stutz out of his nonchalance?
"If the market had gone down again today followed by another drastic drop tomorrow, I am sure the calls would have started going to our portfolio manager to ask him what this means," Mr. Stutz said. "But a one-day drop like yesterday, I figure that goes with the territory."
Jeff Croyle of Kwasha Lipton Group, the benefits consulting arm of the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, agreed. "The herd mentality would kick in after a couple of days" of sharp drops, he said.

HEADLINE: Amid Day-After Jitters, Opportunity Beckons

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Yesterday morning, shortly before the stock exchanges' 9:30 start of trading, Daniel K. Cantor seemed remarkably assured for a man who had lost millions of dollars the previous day.
The overnight news from Hong Kong, a flash point in the recent global market slide, was unnerving, down more than 13 percent. Tokyo and the other Asian markets were all heading down sharply, and the gloom was spreading to the European markets for another day. 
 It looked grim. But Mr. Cantor, who manages a $330 million mutual fund, the Stein Roe Growth and Income Fund, that lost 6 percent of its value on Monday, shrugged off both that battering and the cascading declines overseas. In the continuing drop, he saw bargains. "It's the sort of opportunity we've been waiting for," he said, expressing a view shared by many other eager investors yesterday.
When the New York market opened sharply lower, so much the better, he figured. At a few minutes after 10 A.M., Mr. Cantor bought 5,000 shares of Citicorp, when it was trading around $118. The shares closed at $127.50, up $4.1875 on the day, bolstering the assets of a fund that represents mainly the savings of individual investors and puts their money into the blue-chip household names of corporate America.
For a day at least, Mr. Cantor's view of financial reality prevailed. Investors as diverse as major corporations, like I.B.M., and individuals like Robert Baird of Denver said that they were untroubled by the previous week's market slide. The recent bad news, they said, was really good news -- justification for a daylong share-shopping spree. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 337.17 points, or 4.71 percent, while the Nasdaq rose 4.43 percent and the American Stock Exchange advanced 1.49 percent.
For Wall Street's professional stock traders, the day began in deep anxiety and ended in relief -- though not triumphant optimism that the market's decline had been permanently reversed.
At 5 A.M., Robert M. Murphy awoke at his home in Colts Neck, N.J., and a half-hour later was driving to his job on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Murphy is president of Robb, Peck & McCooey, a so-called specialist firm. Specialists are designated by the stock exchange to make a market -- standing ready to buy and sell specified stocks, if needed to keep the market operating and orderly. Mr. Murphy's firm handles the shares of 200 different companies, including Philip Morris and Eastman Kodak.
By 6:30 A.M., Mr. Murphy had arrived at the exchange and met with his colleagues at the firm, all of whom, he said, were "pretty much in shell shock." Given the overnight slide in the Asian stock markets and a trend of declines that continued in Europe, he felt certain the market here would open lower.
"My stomach tells me I'm going to have to put on the helmet and get back in the foxhole," he said. "It could be a pretty tough day."
His worries were shared by the hundreds of traders, sitting in row after row, in Smith Barney's cavernous stock trading room on the third floor of 390 Greenwich Street. As the market opened, Robert E. Moore, a managing director on the trading floor, spoke of the possibility that the Dow industrials could fall more than 300 points to the 6,800 range.
Before the opening, there was talk about the essential strength of the American economy -- the steady growth, robust corporate profits and low inflation. It was all true, but none of that had prodded the stock market higher recently.
The Smith Barney traders realized that the market would open lower in a knee-jerk response to the foreign markets. The real test, they said, would come later in the day, if a second wave of selling developed. Or a rally.
The answer came quickly. Shortly after the opening, the Dow Jones was indeed down 105 points. But then came glimmers of a rally -- a surge of orders from mutual fund managers, like Mr. Cantor, and reports that corporations were ready to step in and buy back their own shares. The financial news wires reported that I.B.M. said it would spend as much as $3.5 billion for its shares.
Just after 10 A.M., the tide had turned. "It has all the marks of a good rally," one relieved Smith Barney trader declared.
In Denver, Mr. Baird, a 36-year-old vice president at Samsonite, was smarting from Monday's selloff on Wall Street. His personal portfolio -- composed mainly of well-known companies, including Citicorp, General Electric, Motorola and Microsoft -- had lost $150,000 in a single day. Like the professional fund managers, he was thinking of buying. But, first, he wanted the market to drop further.
Had the Dow average declined an additional 300 points yesterday, Mr. Baird said, "I would have added to my positions in my core stocks."
Mr. Baird spoke to his broker at midday, but decided not to buy into yesterday's rally. He will watch the market closely for the next couple of weeks. "If it drops more, then I'm going to buy," he said.
In general, he believes in the soundness of the nation's economy. The market's recent slide did not tempt him to sell. "Our economy looks very healthy and corporate earnings reports are still showing some good gains," Mr. Baird said. "I'm sure the market will rebound."
The stock market has long served as kind of fun-house mirror of economic sentiment, exaggerating both optimism and pessimism. Big market moves do have an impact on consumer spending and corporate investment. Yet to have any sizable economic effect, the shift, up or down, must be large and lasting.
Economists estimate, for example, that for every dollar that a person loses in portfolio value, he or she spends 3 cents less during the next year or two. Corporate investment, economists calculate, falls a percentage point or two in a year if the market drops by 10 percent.
"The linkage is real, but it's not huge, unless the market really falls off a cliff and stays there," said David Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's DRI, a research firm in Lexington, Mass.
Yet it is globalization of the financial markets that has changed markedly in the years that Mr. Wyss, who is 52, has studied the links between the stock market and the economy. Yesterday, he was in his suburban Boston office at 7:30 A.M., anxiously monitoring the overnight activity in foreign markets on a pair of computer terminals, especially after the alarming drop abroad, as in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index.
"Years ago, people used to think Hang Seng was a surfing term," he said. "Now, you've really got to pay attention to international markets."
In Silicon Valley, the spreading falloff in global markets, before yesterday's rebound in the United States, was viewed as evidence of the fast-moving globalization aided by information technology.
Roger McNamee, general partner of Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park, Calif., noted that the information age had linked the world's far-flung economies more tightly and opened markets. Yet the accelerated flow of information and capital, he says, also carried the risk that the forces enhancing economic growth could also transmit trouble more quickly. "This is the flip side of the information economy," said Mr. McNamee, a truly mobile investor who always carries a pager, cellular phone and notebook computer.
Mr. McNamee's firm both invests venture capital in high-technology start-ups and manages a fund of more than $600 million invested in public companies. And yesterday afternoon, after the markets recovered some of their recently lost ground, he was feeling cautiously confident. The share prices of high-technology companies are notoriously volatile, prompting the Silicon Valley quip that investors in these start-ups should be given neck braces along with their shares.
Even if further large drops occur, Mr. McNamee said, he did not expect a rerun of the aftermath of the 1987 crash. In 1988, he noted, fewer than a dozen technology companies could sell new shares to the public, compared with the hundreds of new public offerings annually seen in the last couple of years.
"The total scale of the high-tech economy is so much greater than it used to be," Mr. McNamee said, "and there are so many more solid small companies than there used to be, so things shouldn't dry up."
In Dallas, Frederick E. Rowe, a money manager, used local terms to make the case for taking the market's gyrations in stride.
"Investors are like those cattle," he told a real estate developer and potential investor who had driven an hour and a half to Dallas from his ranch. "Maybe they heard a cricket. Maybe they heard thunder. Maybe a mountain lion. Maybe they thought they saw a mountain lion. Maybe they heard something about the Thai baht. One of them start moving. Then the others start moving. They stampede. Then they stop."
By lunchtime yesterday, a hectic morning for Mr. Rowe had calmed considerably. The flow of phone calls from worried investors, heavy early in the morning as stocks kept falling, tapered off as they rebounded and gained. "It will be all right in the long term," he assured a caller.
For Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, yesterday was a test -- one when the best strategy may be silence, but also one when the Administration had to be ready to act should a market drop prove far worse.
Mr. Rubin started his day with a 7:45 A.M. strategy session with Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff. The issue: how President Clinton should handle the market's drop when he spoke in Chicago.
During the meeting, Mr. Clinton tried to reach Mr. Rubin at the Treasury, looking for exactly that guidance. By then, a brief set of suggested comments was being faxed to him in Chicago.
After talking with Mr. Rubin around 9 A.M. -- and getting briefed on the wreckage in the Hong Kong market overnight -- the President took his cue. Making clear the contrast between America and Asia without ever explicitly comparing the two, Mr. Clinton described American businesses and banks as "healthy and sound," adding that with "new jobs being created every day, our economy is continuing to grow steady and strong."
"The effort," one Administration official said, "was to refocus investors on the economy, not the market."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CANDIDATES;
Ministers Back McGreevey; Whitman Stumps With Kemp

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 28

 BODY:
More than two dozen black ministers gathered here today to announce their endorsement of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, James E. McGreevey, a week after the head of the Black Ministers Council threw his support behind Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's re-election bid.
The church leaders, representing hundreds of black churches across the state, said they were concerned that there may be confusion among blacks that the executive director of the Black Ministers Council was speaking for all of them. 
 "The Republicans like to pretend that African-Americans are coming out for Whitman, but I would tell Jim McGreevey not to worry because, as Elijah told the king, 'There is another army, the army of God standing behind, and there are more with us than are with him,' " said the Rev. John Ragin, the pastor of St. Luke's A.M.E. Church in Newark, and the president of the New Jersey A.M.E. Conference. "Jim, hold on to God's army."
As Mr. McGreevey welcomed the endorsement and then spent much of the day courting elderly voters in Ocean County, Governor Whitman continued her bus tour of the state, now in its fourth day.
Mrs. Whitman shook hands with commuters in the Bergen County town of Waldwick, spoke at a luncheon for small-business owners in Jamesburg, in Middlesex County, and toured the laboratories of one of the state's largest employers, the communications giant Lucent Technologies in Monmouth County.
With Jack Kemp, last year's Republican vice presidential candidate, at her side, Mrs. Whitman also toured Perth Amboy's downtown business district. Shoppers there pay lower sales taxes and business owners receive tax incentives under a state program that is similar to a redevelopment initiative that Mr. Kemp is credited with introducing during his days as secretary of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"I'm just here as an Abraham Lincoln Republican," Mr. Kemp said, when asked if he thought his visit would help the Governor attract the more conservative wing of the state's Republican Party.
"I don't think the Republican Party can survive unless we have a strategy to save America's cities."
As Mrs. Whitman strolled down Smith Street, crowds gathered and walked alongside her. But while local residents waved placards that read, "Latinos and Whitman," Mayor Joseph Vas, a Democrat who had been expected to campaign with the Governor today, was notably absent.
When asked about the Mayor's apparent change of heart, Mrs. Whitman said that Mr. Vas had endorsed her at an earlier event, and she could not expect to "necessarily get two or three bites of the apple."
The endorsement of Mr. McGreevey today by the black ministers is expected to help bolster his campaign for black votes.
The pastors vowed not only to urge members of their congregations to vote for Mr. McGreevey, but also to help take church members to the polls.
"We are sure that you are going to create and provide an atmosphere that is inclusive," said the Rev. Calvin McKinney, the president of the New Jersey General Baptist Convention, which represents 430 churches.
Mr. McGreevey promised to work closely with the ministers, if elected. "I make a fundamental sacred communitment: to work with the pastors to rebuild our cities, to join in partnership," he said.
The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, the executive director of the Black Ministers Council, pointed out that there had been disagreement in the past among church leaders over endorsements of political candidates. He said that he stood firmly by his decision to offer his personal endorsement of Mrs. Whitman.
Mr. McGreevey also campaigned at senior centers and retirement villages in Ocean County, where he called for the full restoration of a state program that provides home health care services. The program allows recipients, who are not eligible for Medicaid, to receive some subsidized health care services at home. The Whitman administration has not accepted any new enrollments for the program for more than a year.
"It was intended to provide home health care services to the elderly and to the disabled," Mr. McGreevey said at the Lacey Community Hall in Lacey. "The basic concept is that we can care for our elderly at home for the same cost we pay for a nursing home. For the past two years, there has been a deliberate effort to eliminate the home care expansion program."
Mr. McGreevey also criticized the Governor for trying to reduce the number of senior citizens who would be eligible for the state's subsidized prescription.

China's President Wades Into American Culture
Emulating his predecessor, Deng Xiaoping, President Jiang Zemin donned a gift hat in America. He was given a three-cornered colonial-style hat and wore it enthusiastically on a brief visit to Williamsburg, where he met an actor dressed as Thomas Jefferson, whom the Chinese leader frequently quotes. Deng got his ten-gallon hat at an outing to a rodeo in Texas in 1979. A18 

President Clinton and Jiang Zemin agreed to establish a round-the-clock telephone line between Washington and Beijing as a concrete sign of warming relations between the two powers. A18
 
U.S. Troops May Stay in Bosnia
The Clinton Administration has resolved to leave some American troops in Bosnia after their current mission ends next June, senior Administration officials and Western diplomats said. How many would stay, and what they would do, remains to be determined, they said, noting that the President has yet to sign off on the proposal. A3
 
U.N. to Probe Scottish Courts
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan plans to name two experts to inspect the Scottish legal system, hoping to defuse Libya's criticism that two of its citizens wanted for trial in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 would not receive a fair trial there. Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, has argued for the trial being held in a third country, or at the International Court of Justice in the Hague. A5
 
Time Out in Israeli Conflict
One day after leaders of the Conservative and Reform movements in Israel vowed to pursue legal action against the Orthodox rabbinate, they agreed to a grace period to mediate the dispute. They object to the Orthodox establishment's exclusive rights to perform conversions to Judaism in Israel and to serve on religious councils. A Government committee will try to find a compromise. A7
 
Coup Defused In Zambia
The Zambian Government said that a coup attempt that lasted a mere three hours had been suppressed without bloodshed and that a handful of military officers had been arrested. Such news from relatively stable southern Africa surprised many observers, especially as Zambia had withstood troubles even though it shares borders with Congo and Angola, both riven by civil wars. A11
 
Spanish Socialists Convicted
Spain's Supreme Court convicted two senior officials of the Socialist Party for their role in a campaign finance scandal that helped defeat the Government of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez last year. Court officials said Sen. Josep Maria Sala was sentenced to three years in prison, and Carlos Navarro, a former congressman, to 11 years. Six other individuals were also found guilty in the Filesa case, named for the company that was reportedly set up to funnel funds to the party. Those convicted plan to appeal. (Reuters)

Congress Moves to Limit Some Computer Exports
Congress is moving to tighten controls over the export of high performance American computers to Russia and China, prompting strong opposition from the White House and computer manufacturers and talk of a possible veto. A22
 
Youth Drug Use Surveyed
The country's largest survey of adolescent drug use shows that while the popularity of marijuana and other drugs appears to be leveling off among older high school students, more of their younger brothers and sisters are trying drugs. A20
 
Rules Sought on Airline Data
The Federal Aviation Administration will soon propose a rule under which airlines that voluntarily provide detailed data on routine operations would be given immunity from prosecution for minor violations that the data reveal, the Administrator of the agency, Jane Garvey, said. Ms. Garvey said that a second rule, which would follow soon, would seek to make the data immune to the Freedom of Information Act, and off-limits to plaintiffs' lawyers who sue airlines after plane crashes. A24
 
New Plane Crash Guidelines
A task force on how to assist families of plane crash victims will recommend today that airlines and travel agents be required to ask people who buy tickets for the name and phone number of someone to call in an emergency. The task force will also recommend extending the 30-day period after a crash during which it is illegal for airline insurance companies and lawyers looking for clients to speak with bereaved families. It will also recommend that reporters confine themselves to certain areas at crash scenes, and avoid approaching family members except in designated areas. A24
 
A Tax Defines Virginia Race
James S. Gilmore 3d, the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, has vaulted to a lead in three major statewide polls after months of running even with his Democratic opponent, Donald S. Beyer, the two-term Lieutenant Governor. Mr. Gilmore's advantage is built in part on his pledge to eliminate the state's car tax. A20
 
Senate Drops Highway Bill
The Senate abandoned its efforts to pass a six-year, $145 billion highway financing bill after supporters of campaign finance overhaul blocked a fourth effort to advance the popular legislation toward a final floor vote. A22
 
Councilman Faces Scrutiny
Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez has been facing increasing pressure to resign since his arrest on cocaine possession charges two months ago. Constituents have organized a recall movement; last week two of Mr. Hernandez's council colleagues called for his resignation, and on Monday, Mayor Richard J. Riordan also said he should resign "in the best interests of his constituents and the city." A20

Nushawn J.

Mayor Expands Drug Stings
Returning to his pledge to make fighting drugs a priority in a second term, Mayor Giuliani announced the expansion of sting operations in New York City parks that for the first time involve undercover police officers selling marijuana to buyers, and then arresting them. B1
 
Work Starts at Ellis Island
Preservationists worried that Congress is ignoring the decay of the long-neglected south side of Ellis Island have raised $50,000 to shore up one of the 24 buildings, saying they hope the work, which began recently, will shame the Federal Government into paying for emergency repairs to the rest of the site. Up to 24 buildings are at risk from rot and rust, but could be preserved with a $3 million investment, advocates said. B3

HEADLINE: War on Auto Tax Is Giving G.O.P. an Edge in Virginia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Kathy Smith has a 9-month-old daughter and a 2-year-old Toyota Camry. As she sees it, the $300 state car tax she paid to the Alexandria city government this year, came at her child's expense.
"That's worth almost one month of day care," said Ms. Smith, who works for Alexandria's Department of Human Services. "You buy a car, you pay the sales tax. You shouldn't have to pay anything additional." 
 James S. Gilmore 3d, the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, agrees and has made eliminating the car tax on the first $20,000 of book value the cornerstone of his campaign.
It appears that his stand could win him the election next Tuesday.
After months of running even with his Democratic opponent, Donald S. Beyer, the two-term Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Gilmore has vaulted to a lead in three major statewide polls. A survey published by The Washington Post last week showed Mr. Gilmore with a seven-point lead. In a Roanoke College poll released on Monday, Mr. Gilmore led by 12 points, and in a poll released today by Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Mr. Gilmore led by 8 points.
In all three polls, Mr. Gilmore's lead exceeded the statistical margin of error.
Political analysts around the state say that voters like Ms. Smith are the reason Mr. Gilmore has jumped ahead. In a campaign in which both candidates have emphasized putting into effect new education programs as their chief objective, many voters in the final days have focused, instead, on a tax that costs some car owners as much as $1,000 a year. Each local government sets its own car tax rate. Mr. Gilmore has calculated that if his plan is approved, 90 percent of Virginia car owners would no longer pay the tax by the end of a five-year phase-in period. The state would reimburse municipalities for the lost revenue.
"Our poll shows that anyone who is voting on a tax issue is going to vote for Gilmore," said Robert S. Holsworth, a professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University. "Beyer has an advantage on the education platforms, but he has never been able to elevate his education plank to the same level Gilmore has with the car tax."
Mr. Beyer at first criticized the Gilmore tax plan, contending it would cost the state $1 billion a year, damaging educational programs in state public schools. Mr. Gilmore said projections of economic growth would more than compensate for the tax cut.
When voters began responding to Mr. Gilmore's plan enthusiastically, Mr. Beyer proposed a tax plan of his own, giving car owners a modest tax credit, up to $250, to help offset what they pay for the car tax.
The polling results show that Mr. Gilmore's approach has begun swaying many voters. But more than that, Mr. Holsworth said, it has become an issue that represents to many voters a major position change by Mr. Beyer, who has been plagued by other late-campaign problems.
In a debate televised around the state earlier this month, Mr. Beyer accused Mr. Gilmore, the state's former Attorney General, of offering plea agreements to 35 defendants after the state had abolished parole and adopted tougher sentencing guidelines. The next day, Mr. Gilmore proved Mr. Beyer incorrect with evidence that he only offered nine such deals, forcing Mr. Beyer to apologize and admit he was wrong.
Two weeks later, former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat who became the first black ever elected as a governor in the United States, announced that he would endorse neither candidate. It was a stinging rebuke for Mr. Beyer, who served his first term under Mr. Wilder, and it could persuade many black voters to stay home on Election Day.
Mr. Gilmore said in an interview that Mr. Beyer's failure to win Mr. Wilder's support was "a devastating blow." But more reflective of his surge in the polls, he added, was a growing belief by voters that his economic plan makes more sense than Mr. Beyer's.
Mr. Beyer continues to be unpersuaded, even with mounting evidence that he is even slipping in the traditional Democratic stronghold of Northern Virginia, where Mr. Beyer's family owns a successful car dealership.
Speaking at a high school in Norfolk, Mr. Beyer acknowledged today that his slip in the polls was mainly linked to Mr. Gilmore's salesmanship on the car tax. Mr. Beyer agreed that advocating its elimination had "political sex appeal," but he argued that "it is the wrong thing to do."
"I know people hate the car tax," he said. "They hate to write the check. I'm a car dealer; I know. Most people hate the Federal income tax, too."
Mr. Beyer said he would continue to emphasize that using so much state money to offset the tax would hurt schools, calling that "the central message of my campaign."
"If people hear that message," he added, "I'll win."

HEADLINE: Conspiracy Overload

BYLINE: By P. J. O'Rourke; P. J. O'Rourke, the international affairs desk chief for Rolling Stone magazine, is the author most recently of "Age and Guile Beat Youth, Innocence and a Bad Haircut."

 BODY:
Some of my politically conservative compeers have been telling wild tales about the Clinton Administration. They see vast conspiracies in the small-time chicanery of Whitewater, Castle Grande and the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. They view the shabby, provincial Rose Law Firm as a super-villain cabal worth a new Batman film. They experience fits of credulity about drug smuggling at the airport in Mena, Ark., and an adolescent Bill Clinton's K.G.B. contacts. They monger gossip about the President and his wife participating in what may be politely termed a rich and varied social life, and they claim that webs of hidden influence are spun from such extramaritalities.
I'm a right-wing nut myself -- believing in flat tax, Second Amendment rights, God and other things liberals find incredible. But I do not believe Vince Foster was kidnapped by space aliens or murdered by a jealousy-maddened Ruth Bader Ginsburg or whatever the latest canard is. More likely Mr. Foster came to Washington with people he thought were friends, hated the place, was having personal problems and then discovered that he was to be left holding a large bag of Whitewater effluvium. In the matter of his own death, poor Mr. Foster had what a prosecutor (special or otherwise) would call "motive, means and opportunity." 
 I don't understand why conservatives resort to the fabulous to discredit such a less-than-fabulous Administration. The reality of the Clinton Presidency is damning enough. The energy would be better spent attacking Mr. Clinton's political principles -- if and when he shows any.
Maybe this is the problem. Mr. Clinton is so elusive that conservatives are driven to romance by frustration. Here is a man who no one disputes is untrustworthy but whom everyone agrees to like. A man of dubious courage and character who defeats not one but two war heroes. A man who beats Republicans by running as one. A man who is able to use arguments from the right, the left and indeed from thin air (i.e., global warming) to further a political agenda that seems to consist of nothing but making everything more political.
Conspiracy theories are the traditional consolation of the powerless, and conservatives feel powerless watching President Clinton benefit from the cold war victory and the free market success won by conservative ideas. He is a cheerleader who thinks he carried the ball, a cheerleader for the other side at that. In the past we've seen powerless conservatives create McCarthyism, the John Birch Society and water fluoridation hysteria just as we've seen powerless liberals create Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology and Political Science. Now it's the conservatives' turn to play the fools again.
Conspiracy theories are also the consolation of the stupid. Bill Clinton as President of the United States is a perplexing phenomenon. A conspiracy might explain it. Contrary to certain appearances, liberals do not have a monopoly on thickheadedness. When a stupid person espouses a conspiracy theory, he is saying, "The world is so stupid that, given some special information, even I can understand it."
But although all conservatives are exasperated with Bill Clinton and some are stupid, too, the best reason for conservatives to pull the longbow about the Presidency is to get attention. The public is not listening to the substantive points conservatives are making -- about sloppy foreign policy, entitlement burdens, military unpreparedness, tyrannical regulatory powers and other fundamental issues. In a time of no international threats and a prospering economy (check today's Hang Seng closing to make sure these things are still true), the public doesn't care about political principles. With giddy insouciance Americans support family values legislation, then go out and act like the cast of "Melrose Place." They vote for tax cuts, they vote for benefit increases, and they often don't vote at all. An entire New Jersey gubernatorial race is being fought on the issue of car insurance rates.
If it makes conservatives feel better, nobody is listening to Bill Clinton, either. Watch him desperately trying for a "place in history" -- one week it's as welfare reform maestro, the next week as race relations adept, then ecology maven, education cognoscente, etc. He may come back in a hundred years to find that his historical place is "whatshisname with two terms between Bush pere and Bush fils."
I think Bill Clinton and the conservative bunko merchants should go on one of those daytime television shows. The President could confess that he did everything of which he's accused. The conservative pundits could admit that they made up every allegation. All concerned could hug and cry. And maybe somebody would tune in.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Its Tumble Against Mark and Swiss Franc

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar, continuing its pattern of recent days, tumbled yesterday against major European currencies but rose against the Japanese yen.
The United States currency fell to its second consecutive five-month low against the Swiss franc and dropped to a four-month low against the German mark for a second day. Traders considered traditionally safe European currencies a haven for their money amid continued uncertainty about the course of world financial markets. 
 The dollar fell to a three-month low against the British pound for a third consecutive session. The pound has been strengthened by the British Government's announcement on Monday that it would not join the European common currency immediately when it is introduced next year. The pound fetched $1.6717, up from $1.6711.
The yen also struggled yesterday against European currencies, which indirectly helped the dollar strengthen against the Japanese currency.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4093 Swiss francs, down from 1.4223 late Tuesday and its lowest level since May 21. It fell to 1.7293 marks from 1.7368, a level not seen since June 26.
The two European currencies are "appealing places to park funds in the short term," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney.
Contributing to the dollar's slump against European currencies was Congressional testimony from the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, that left traders confident that the Fed would not raise interest rates soon. Mr. Greenspan said recent market gyrations could have a long-run benefit for the American economy by helping it slow to a more sustainable pace, suggesting that the Fed would not raise rates to cool inflationary pressure.
Higher interest rates generally raise demand for a country's currency. Many traders believe Germany's central bank will raise interest rates before the Fed does, and the Bank of England has already raised rates four times this year.
The dollar rallied to 120.78 yen, up from 120.47.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday included 5.7880 French francs, down from 5.8257, and 1,695 Italian lire, down from 1,702.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Up Sharply As Iraq Bans U.S. Officials

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil futures prices rose yesterday after Iraq barred Americans from a team overseeing dismantling of some of its weapons, a move that could lead to a complete ban on Iraqi oil exports. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline also jumped.
On other markets, copper futures prices rose as rebounding world stock prices prompted optimism that Asian economies could bounce back, lifting demand for the metal in the construction industry. 
 Crude oil and its products jumped after the leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, ordered 10 American members of the United Nations weapons inspections team expelled from the country within a week, contending that Washington had impeded Iraqi sovereignty.
The action came in response to a United Nations resolution, passed late last week with urging from the Clinton Administration, that threatened to impose travel restrictions on Iraqi officials if they did not cooperate with inspection teams.
Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction before the United Nations will lift the oil embargo it imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
An exception to the embargo allows Iraq to export slightly more than $2 billion in oil every six months to pay for food and medicine. The oil amounts to about a million barrels a day, or 1.6 percent of global output.
Some investors were betting that the United Nations would cut the flow of oil from Iraq. But prices retreated from the day's highs on the expectation that even if exports were stopped, other countries would move to fill the void, said Gerald E. Samuels, an analyst at ARB Oil Inc.
Crude oil for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 25 cents, to $20.71 a barrel, after rising as high as $20.95. November heating oil rose 0.67 cent, to 57.19 cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose 1.21 cents, to 60.09 cents a gallon.
Copper futures prices followed world stock market prices higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, amid easing concerns about a weak world economy that could reduce demand for the metal in everything from cars to electronics and plumbing. December copper rose 0.55 cent, to 91.05 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: 2 U.S. Reports Add to Evidence of Minimal Inflation

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Orders for long-lasting goods fell in September for the first time in three months, the Commerce Department said today in a report that suggested that American industrial activity might be slowing.
In another report that pointed to noninflationary economic growth, the Federal Reserve Board said its regional survey of the country showed steady prices and infrequent wage pressures. 
 The two reports coincided with testimony to Congress by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who asserted that the economy was continuing to expand with no sign of accelerating inflation.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony and the economic data contributed to gains in the stock and bond markets, which viewed them as evidence that the Fed was unlikely to raise interest rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.35 points to 7,506.67, adding to its record comeback rally of 337.17 points, or 7.2 percent, on Tuesday. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a harbinger of interest rate trends, eased to 6.20 percent from 6.28 percent.
The Commerce Department data showed orders for durable goods fell six-tenths of a percent, to $185.73 billion, after rising a revised 2.8 percent in August, to a record $186.81 billion. In its previous reading on durable goods on Oct. 2, the Government reported that August orders rose 2.7 percent, to $186.55 billion.
The September drop was led by declines in orders for aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, and electronic equipment. Before the report, analysts had expected orders to show a drop of four-tenths of a percent.
When the often-volatile category of transportation equipment is excluded, durable goods orders rose two-tenths of a percent last month. Excluding military hardware, orders decreased three-tenths of a percent.
Unfilled orders, a gauge of pent-up demand, increased one-tenth of a percent in September after rising 1.1 percent in August. Shipments of goods, a gauge of current demand, rose 2.1 percent last month after decreasing 1.3 percent in August.
Despite the decline, economists cautioned against reading too much into one month's factory report because orders for durable goods tend to vary widely from month to month.
The Fed's regional economic report, known as the beige book, said prices remained stable partly because competition and customer resistance made it difficult for producers to raise prices.
Most of the 12 Fed district banks contributing to the report characterized growth in their regions as moderate to strong, while retail sales and auto sales were weaker. Labor demand was high, with hiring difficulties reported by employers seeking workers skilled in high technologies.
Residential construction and sales have been uneven, although commercial construction continued to grow, the report said. Bank lending was mixed.
The Fed's regional report is published eight times a year, just before the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets. The latest edition was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, using information collected before Oct. 20.
The report will help form the basis for discussion on interest rate targets at the Nov. 12 meeting of the committee. Most economists expect the panel to refrain from changing the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Economy Tempers in Places, but Remains Vigorous"
A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday.
 
Minneapolis -- Earnings, tax receipts and sales all inc-reased, while prices, for the moment, held steady. While wages did not rise, em-ployers used other incentives to attract workers in a tight labor market.
 
Chicago -- Prices held steady; retailers attributed a slow pace in sales to warm weather, also cited for increases in new-home sales and construction. Manufacturing activity and new orders were strong.
 
Cleveland -- Business activity continued to expand amid extremely low levels of unem-ployment and small wage and price increases.
 
Boston -- Retailers, manufacturers and insurance companies reported steady expansion in revenues; labor markets cited 3% to 5% increases in wages and salaries.
 
New York -- Growth appeared to moderate. Manufacturing accelerated, retail sales slowed, and prices and loan demand held steady.
 
Philadelphia -- Manufacturers saw gains in orders and shipments, but retailers, car dealers and bankers all reported drops in activity.
 
Richmond -- Manufacturing output increased, labor markets tightened, and commercial real estate was robust; home sales slowed.
 
Atlanta -- Retail sales increased modestly, as did commercial construc-tion; wage pressure was seen in fewer industries than in previous months.
 
St. Louis -- The economy continued to surge, with increased sales and an increasing tightness in the labor market.
 
Kansas City -- Labor markets remained tight, with intensifying wage increases. Retail prices held steady, sales dipped slightly, and construction lessened somewhat.
 
Dallas -- Prices rose, and retail sales were slower than expected, although construction and demand for services grew. Many industries reported continued difficulty hiring.
 
San Francisco -- Indications of rapid growth continued, including increases in manufacturing activity and demand for residential and commercial construction; retailers reported moderate gains.

Fed Chief's Remarks Spur Rally in Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rallied yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told a Congressional committee that despite a tight labor market, "growth appears to have remained robust and inflation low, and even falling."
Still, Mr. Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee that the Fed could not take a complacent view of inflation. "It is terribly important for us to make sure that this recovery continues and continues in a solid way," he said, adding that an onset of inflation would be "the greatest threat to it at the moment." 
 His comments were a relief to bond market participants, who now expect no rate increase when the Fed's Open Market Committee, the panel that sets interest rate policy, meets on Nov. 12.
The 30-year Treasury bond gained 15/32 points to a price of 10212/32 , pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to 6.20 percent, from 6.28 percent on Tuesday.
Also bolstering Treasuries yesterday, analysts said, was a flight to quality fueled by a plunge in Brazil's stock market and by rumors of rising tensions between North and South Korea.
Another factor was a report that new orders for durable goods fell six-tenths of 1 percent in September, primarily because of a decline in civilian aircraft orders.
Despite the slippage, said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, durable goods orders continue to demonstrate resiliency. Discussing the recent turmoil in world equity markets and its economic effects, Mr. Fine forecast that American exports would fall, while imports would rise, widening the trade deficit and acting "as a drag on economic momentum."
In auction activity yesterday, traders said the sale of the five-year Treasury note was disappointing. The notes sold at a higher price than expected to yield 5.83 percent.
The Treasury said yesterday that its quarterly refunding next week would include $14 billion of new three-year notes; $11 billion of 10-year notes (actually the issuance of more of the 6.125 percent coupon first auctioned on Aug. 8), and $10 billion of new 30-year bonds. Analysts said this would be the smallest quarterly refunding with a long bond since May 1993.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's auctions, dealers began offering the securities at prices to yield 5.69 percent for a three-year note; 5.90 percent for the reopened 10-year note and 6.17 percent for the 30-year bond.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Waiters Settle Suit With Chinatown Restaurant

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
In what Asian-American labor groups are calling a big victory, Chinatown's largest restaurant has agreed to pay more than $1.1 million to 58 workers who said they had been cheated out of tips and wages, officials said yesterday.
The Attorney General's office filed a lawsuit in January that charged Jing Fong restaurant with cheating workers out of more than $1.5 million in tips and wages since 1993 by illegally controlling the distribution of tips and withholding some of them. The Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund had filed a lawsuit against Jing Fong in Federal District Court seeking $500,000 on behalf of workers who said the restaurant had failed to pay overtime and violated minimum-wage laws. 
 Yesterday's settlement between Jing Fong and the Attorney General's office and the legal defense fund is not the first between Chinatown workers and their employers. But it is the biggest, and perhaps the most important, in Chinatown, an area of sharp labor conflict.
"We have to treat the workers with dignity, with respect, we have to pay them the wages they're entitled to, and if they don't, we're going to be here," Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco said in front of the restaurant on Elizabeth Street.
Hugh H. Mo, an attorney representing Jing Fong's owners, said that too much was being made of the settlement, in which Jing Fong admits no wrongdoing. "Jing Fong is not a slave-labor scam," he said. "We would've preferred to litigate this in a court of law. But we are mindful of the fact that restaurants play a crucial role in the Chinese-American economy and Jing Fong is concerned about the continuing bloodletting from this case."
Jing Fong is Chinatown's largest restaurant and seats more than 1,000 in a dining area that seems as big as an ocean liner. On weekends, the place teems with people speaking Cantonese to waiters pushing dim sum carts.
But some waiters and busboys said they were paid as little as $65 to $100 a week for working 60 or more hours -- a workweek that should have earned them $213 a week at the minimum wage, plus overtime and tips. When one waiter, Sheng Gang Deng, complained publicly to managers in 1995, he was fired, according to the Attorney General's office.
Under the settlement announced yesterday, the restaurant's owners are expected to pay the employees in installments over the next 32 months. Mr. Deng will be rehired -- with a guarantee that he will not be discriminated against. In addition, managers will no longer control the collection and distribution of tips, which, according to state law, is supposed to be controlled by the waiters.
Peter Kwong, director of Hunter College's Asian-American studies program, said a garment manufacturer had settled a labor lawsuit for $91,000 in 1991, but the latest settlement would have a larger impact.
"This puts employers on notice that you better pay attention to some of the very, very basic labor conditions," Mr. Kwong said.

HEADLINE: Perot Set to Re-Enter Political Scene

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 28

 BODY:
Ross Perot said he thought of going up to Washington to "bang on some doors" to try to get a campaign finance bill passed, but concluded it would be a waste of time.
"Facts and testimony don't mean anything there," Mr. Perot added, rolling his eyes and professing mock shock that such legislation was currently stymied in Congress. "It's who's paid off who that means everything." 
 The bipartisan campaign finance hearings in Washington are a joke anyway, he said.
"This is like having Willie Sutton and Jesse James investigate one another for bank robbery," Mr. Perot snapped. And over all, he concluded, the nation is in a "Lawrence Welk mode," lethargically ignoring its real problems.
But lest anyone think that Mr. Perot, the two-time Presidential candidate, has grown pessimistic about his role in the nation's public life, watch for him this weekend in Kansas City, Mo. That is the site of a national meeting of the Reform Party, the movement that he founded and bankrolled and whose Presidential nomination he accepted last year -- and might just accept again, if the call comes.
"I will sweep the streets, I'll sleep under a bridge," Mr. Perot said last week on "Larry King Live" on CNN, echoing almost exactly the language he used in 1996 when asked if he would run for the White House. "I'll do anything that I can do constructively to help this country."
For nearly a year, since garnering 8.5 percent of the Presidential vote, the normally loquacious Mr. Perot has been curiously silent, and even some of his supporters have been wondering why he has seemed all but invisible as Congress has taken up campaign reform, an issue that is arguably the centerpiece of Mr. Perot's eclectic set of prescriptions for the nation's ills.
"I must say, a lot of us have wondered about this, about why he has not been more involved and more vocal," said Anne Merkl, chairwoman of the Reform Party of Georgia. "Whatever his reasons are, I'd like to know why, and maybe he'll come forth with that this weekend."
In fact, over the last few days, Mr. Perot has begun speaking out, first on the Larry King show, his time-honored vehicle for getting his message out (his Oct. 20 appearance was his first this year), then in a lengthy interview in his office here. And now he will speak this Saturday night at the Kansas City meeting, which Reform Party officials describe as the "founding convention" of the party. (Obviously, the party was around last year, with Mr. Perot as its nominee, but the meeting now -- with delegations from all 50 states -- is intended to create a formal national committee, a set of party rules and a general declaration of principles.)
Just what the party's impact will be in elections in 1998 or 2000 is unclear, but Mr. Perot, using a series of military analogies, said the whole point of the exercise was to "get organized, get in position, be prepared and wait for the opportunity.
"You need the opportunity," he said in an interview in his office here, adorned with Frederic Remington busts and Norman Rockwell pictures. That opportunity could be a scandal "that gets the American people so totally disgusted" that they demand a new party, or it could be an economic calamity, or it might even be a war, he said, adding, simply, "It will come."
Many of those who have observed Mr. Perot over the years say the reasons for his apparent self-imposed exile from the public fray were obvious.
"Perot was convinced after the '96 election that he was badly overexposed, and needed some quiet time away from the cameras," said Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia who is in frequent contact with Reform Party members. "By and large, to many people's surprise, he stayed out of the limelight for about a year."
Moreover, even among those who dearly want campaign finance reform, there is a strong sense that Mr. Perot is not likely to have much effect on the discussions in Washington.
"Clearly, this issue crystallized with Perot's candidacy in '92, and resonated to a lesser extent in the '96 election," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research group in Washington. "But it's not clear to me that Ross Perot or anything short of the Second Coming would have any impact on these politicians here in Washington. They are determined to maintain the status quo."
Mr. Perot acknowledged that some people were claiming he had, in his words, "gone underground," but he bitterly rejected the characterization.
"Let's look at the record," he said in the interview here. "How many times have I been invited on Larry King? Once. How many times have I appeared? Once. How many times have I been invited on 'Meet the Press'? Once."
Mr. Perot also noted that he had repeatedly sought this year to buy half-hour blocks of prime-time television on the major networks for "infomercials" about campaign finance and other topics. He is correct about that, but the networks have routinely turned down the requests, generally by saying that they do not make such large chunks of time available, especially for "issue oriented" advertising.
In any event, Mr. Perot is back, and he said he was unlikely to fade away because he saw no prospect that either major party would tackle campaign reform issues or long-range fiscal crises like Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare.
"You don't want to know how many key Republicans and Democrats have sat down right where you are and said, What would it take to get you guys to go away or to join us?" Mr. Perot said. "I've said 100 times, the way you get this organization to go away is to do all these things you talk about but never do."
Russell J. Verney, the chairman of the Reform Party national organizing committee, said the party would be fielding all kinds of candidates in elections next year, though he emphasized that the major goal at this point was less to rack up victories than to influence the debate and step up pressure for the party's agenda.
"The bold ideas in American public policy debate have never come from established political parties," Mr. Verney said. "The bold ideas like abolition of slavery, women's right to vote, child labor laws, antitrust laws, progressive taxation and reducing the deficit have all come from third party efforts."
Mr. Perot scoffed at recent reports about squabbles within the Reform Party, perhaps most noticeably a split in Illinois that has two factions claiming to represent the party.
"It's a group of five people, maybe," he said of party dissidents, some of whom he said were working for the "dirty tricks teams" of the two major parties. "They're like mosquitoes at a picnic. You can't let it ruin the picnic."
And of the influence of money in politics today, Mr. Perot said, "Tammany Hall looks pristine compared to this. Louisiana politics in the 30's, when Huey Long was in, looks like it was controlled by the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts."

HEADLINE: Senate Approves New F.C.C. Chairman

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Senate gave approval today to President Clinton's choice to fill the top post at the Federal Communications Commission, but lawmakers vowed to keep a close eye on the agency as it continues pressing for competition in the telecommunications industry.
In a 99-to-1 vote, the Senate confirmed William E. Kennard as chairman of the agency. Mr. Kennard, 40, the general counsel for the F.C.C., replaces Reed E. Hundt. 
 The vote follows months of rancorous debate on Capitol Hill over the pace of deregulation under last year's sweeping telecommunications legislation. Lawmakers worry that their vision of competition is being clouded by mergers, higher rates for consumers and new regulations.
Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, voted against the nominee, saying he feared that the F.C.C. would allow higher calling rates for rural telephone users.
Late on Tuesday, the Senate had cleared three other nominees for the five-member commission: Michael Powell, chief of staff at the Justice Department's antitrust division; Harold Furchtgott-Roth, an economist with the House Commerce Committee, and Gloria Tristani, a New Mexico state utilities regulator.
Several senators had expressed concerns about the nomination of Mr. Kennard, including Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina, who questioned an F.C.C. decision to pull the construction permit of a radio station in Asheville, N.C. But Mr. Helms said his fears were allayed after meeting with Mr. Kennard earlier this month.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: THE POLITICS;
A Chinese Visitor Comes Between Longtime California Allies

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
One woos. The other attacks.
One danced with Jiang Zemin, now China's President, when he was Mayor of Shanghai in the 1980's. The other protested in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1991 in memory of pro-democracy demonstrators killed by soldiers two years earlier. 
 Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Nancy Pelosi are both hard-charging Democrats from San Francisco whose politics suggest that they should be on the same side of the most important strategic challenge of the Clinton Presidency: how to deal with China.
Instead -- as the state visit of Mr. Jiang illustrates -- the two lawmakers represent polar ends of the debate over what to do about a nuclear power with a three-million-man army, an abysmal human rights record, one-fourth the world's population and the fastest growing economy in the world.
For Ms. Feinstein, 64, whose husband has invested tens of millions of dollars in China on behalf of his clients, the answer is to make friends with the Chinese to build a strong bilateral partnership, make money for American corporations and perhaps change China's bad behavior along the way.
In Ms. Feinstein's view, Mr. Jiang's problem with America is that he is not given enough respect. "I always felt he was underestimated," she said. "This is really the first Chinese leader with a higher education. He can be austere, as Chinese leaders are, or very jovial."
For Ms. Pelosi, 57, the key to dealing with China is to deprive the country of its preferential trade benefits until it no longer tortures political prisoners, uses prison labor, forces women to have abortions and restricts freedom of speech and religion. Honoring Mr. Jiang with a state visit represents the worst kind of pandering to the interests of American business, she said.
"It is shameful for the United States to give a state dinner and a 21-gun salute to the leader of a regime that crushed dissent in Tiananmen Square," Ms. Pelosi said. "It's the best welcome money can buy. I call the state dinner the 'ultimate coffee.' "
The two women's activities surrounding the state visit underscore their differences.
Ms. Feinstein is so close to Mr. Jiang (he calls her Dianne; she sometimes calls him Zemin) that she visited him in Beijing four weeks ago to suggest ways to make the state visit a success. Distressed that Mr. Jiang was only getting a lukewarm welcome on Capitol Hill, Ms. Feinstein organized a reception for him with her fellow senators at Blair House, the Presidential guest house across from the White House.
"I would very much like to invite you to meet the President of the People's Republic of China," her invitation read, reminding her colleagues that she has known him for years and advising them that "it is best to be on time."
Several Senators, including Joseph Biden of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, were displeased that Ms. Feinstein organized such an important foreign policy event -- particularly without consulting more senior colleagues on the committee, Senate staffers said. Of the 70 senators invited, only about half have accepted.
At a coffee on Tuesday for Chinese dissidents and former political prisoners organized by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a longtime China-basher, the two women's different approaches were on display.
Ms. Pelosi said it was an honor to be in the same room with the dissidents, whom she called the "true heirs to Thomas Jefferson." Ms. Feinstein reminded the former political prisoner Harry Wu that she was instrumental in persuading Mr. Jiang to release him, Mr. Wu said.
"I told her Jiang Zemin was the criminal responsible for the persecution," Mr. Wu said he told her. "I do not appreciate that he does a favor for me by releasing me from prison."
While Ms. Feinstein attended the state dinner at the White House tonight with her husband, Richard C. Blum, Ms. Pelosi was at the alternative "stateless dinner" organized by activists for Tibet at a hotel nearby.
While Mr. Clinton was meeting with Mr. Jiang at the White House today, Ms. Pelosi spoke against the Chinese Government -- and the state visit -- at the human rights rally in Lafayette Park across the street.
In a political environment in which almost any dispute between two women is still called a catfight, both lawmakers claim to be friends. Their San Francisco residences are only two miles apart. Just last week, Ms. Pelosi led a delegation of nine Democrats to Ms. Feinstein's office to urge her to run for Governor.
"There isn't anything like a catfight," Ms. Pelosi said. "We don't have that word in our vocabulary. We agree on a thousand issues. We just have a disagreement on this one."
Ms. Feinstein said: "I want the same things Nancy wants, but I believe we can get there a different way. But I just don't happen to believe it is productive to humiliate China. I don't believe pushing their backs against the wall drives change."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE REGULATORS;
Rethinking Circuit Breakers After Monday's Big Plunge

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt Jr., said today that trading may have been needlessly halted during Monday's market slide and that changes may be needed in the braking devices, known as circuit breakers.
"There have been concerns raised in two areas: about the level at which the current circuit breakers are triggered and whether they unnecessarily disrupt trading," Mr. Levitt told a Senate securities subcommittee. "These are legitimate concerns that should be addressed." 
 He suggested that the circuit breakers be redesigned to kick in when the Dow Jones industrial average drops by a certain percentage rather than a certain number of points.
Circuit breakers, adopted in the wake of the 1987 crash, now call for trading to be halted when the Dow drops 350 points and again if it falls 200 points more. The system's creators intended it to give investors time to make level-headed decisions instead of selling in panic.
Although the exchanges raised these trigger points, from 250 points and 150 points more, in July 1996 and February 1997, because of the market's long rise, many believe that the triggers were not needed on Monday -- and may well have aggravated the market drop. Unlike the 1987 experience, trading this week was orderly and investors at least had accurate price information on which to base decisions.
"It isn't medicine that should be administered for a head cold," said Robert Glauber, a Harvard University professor who was staff director of the commission headed by Nicholas Brady that recommended circuit breakers after the 1987 crash.
Mr. Glauber has suggested that the trigger points be increased, automatically reset by formula each year and applied at the same time to all markets in this country so none would be open when another is closed. He suggested that trading should not be halted until a decline had reached 12 percent, or about 900 points at the current level of the Dow, and be stopped a second time only when the decline reached 20 percent, or about 1,500 points.
Mr. Glauber also complained about the "collar" that curtails certain types of program trades whenever the Dow moves 50 points in either direction, something that occurs about four times each week. But he defended the principle of circuit breakers against complaints by other conference participants that, among other things, trading halts may aggravate, rather than mitigate, market declines and pose particular problems for mutual funds in the daily pricing of their portfolios.
James B. Rogers Jr., a New York investor and former colleague of George Soros, the billionaire financier and philanthropist, was one of the most vociferous objectors to circuit breakers. He called for their abolition, saying they add to investor uncertainty, give professionals extra advantage and will eventually drive business from exchanges subject to them, to overseas markets.
These "absurd" restraints, Mr. Rogers held, were designed to protect the ability of the Wall Street establishment to make sure payments continued to flow, "to help the Merrill Lynches of the world" and not the small investor.
In a paper he presented on circuit breakers, Lawrence Harris of the University of Southern California, said that evidence was scant that trading halts, price limits, collars, margins and transactions affected market volatility.
E. Gerald Corrigan, a senior Goldman, Sachs & Company official who in 1987 was a chief market troubleshooter in his capacity as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, suggested "some rethinking" of circuit breakers today in a wide-ranging discussion of changes of the last decade. He said that Wall Street institutions, the markets and the nation's economic policy were all considerably stronger than in 1987 and that the potential for financial disaster has diminished.
"The risk of a major market meltdown with systemic impact is not zero, but in the current circumstances it is greatly exaggerated by some," Mr. Corrigan said. At the same time, he added "such an event, were it to occur, could be more difficult to contain than in the past."
He dismissed a commonly expressed concern that the public had become fanatical stock market participants by noting that household holdings of equities are in line with those of the 1950's and 1960's, with a greater share in mutual funds but less in individual stocks.
Mr. Brady, a former Treasury Secretary and a panelist today, called the greatest risk to the financial system its "plumbing and wiring" for insuring liquidity but he also fretted about highly leveraged derivatives that he said "are not worth what they cost" in additional risk.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Circuit Breakers at a Glance"
After the 1987 stock market crash, the New York Stock Exchange adopted new rules, often called circuit breakers, intended to slow a market fall. The criteria for invoking them were set in index points, not in percentage terms; the huge rise in the market since then has made them much more prone to trip than was originally intended.
 Here are the current rules for stocks, how often they have been invoked, and what the criteria would be if they were to be adjusted in proportion to today's market (based on Dow closes yesterday and in October 1988, when the rules were adopted). Additional rules covering futures are omitted.
 
50-POINT RULE
 When the Dow Jones industrial average rises or falls 50 points from the previous day's close, index arbitrage orders (computer program trades based on the stocks in an index like the S.&P. 500) cannot be executed at prices that would move the market further from the previous close.
 
INVOKED -- In recent years, very frequently; in 1997 almost daily.
 
IF ADJUSTED -- Would be invoked at a 175-point move in the Dow.
 
350-POINT BREAKER
 When the Dow falls 350 points (originally 250 points), trading in all stocks is halted for 30 minutes.
 
INVOKED -- Just once, at 2:35 P.M. on Oct. 27, 1997.
 
IF ADJUSTED -- 875-point fall in the Dow.
 
550-POINT BREAKER
 When the Dow falls 550 points (originally 400 points), trading in all stocks is halted for one hour.

HEADLINE: MARATHON;
The American Standard-Bearer Is Mark Coogan

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
Mark Coogan's final weekend of training before Sunday's New York City Marathon was complicated by the small interruption of 30 inches of snow dropping on the running trails of Boulder, Colo.
As an autumn storm pounded the Rockies, Coogan did interval training last Friday in snow that blew sideways in a blinding wind. On Saturday, he had to tunnel out of his driveway with a snow shovel. He is the top American in a race where runners from the United States have been buried under an avalanche of international winners since Alberto Salazar's victory in 1982. 
 "It made my back tighten a little, but it didn't mess me up," Coogan said of the shoveling.
According to a preliminary forecast, Sunday in New York looks to be showery with temperatures in the mid-to-upper 50's. Not bad conditions for a marathon. Anyway, for his first attempt at New York, Coogan figures inclement conditions are to his advantage. A native of Manhasset, N.Y., he grew up in Attleboro, Mass., outside Boston. He is accustomed to wind, rain, cold, snow and potholed streets that can interrupt a stride and wrench an ankle.
"It doesn't bug me as much as the next guy," Coogan said. "I can run well in organized chaos."
At 31, the holder of an economics degree from the University of Maryland, Coogan possesses a rare completeness for an American distance runner. He has run a sub-four-minute mile and competed in the Olympics as a marathoner. His personal best of 2 hours 13 minutes 5 seconds came with a second-place finish at the 1996 Olympic marathon trials. The Olympics themselves were not such a pleasant experience. Coogan finished 41st in Atlanta on a hilly, humid, draining course.
"I thought I was in awesome shape," Coogan said. "At 16 or 17 miles, I went from the lead pack to struggling on my own, feeling sorry for myself. But the heat and dehydration won't be a problem in New York."
Unlike others who jumped right back into marathoning, Coogan has not run a 26.2-mile race since Atlanta some 15 months ago. He is rested, healthy and fit for New York, having put in 10 weeks of training above 100 miles and 5 weeks above 120 miles.
Several weeks ago, on a nine-and-a-half-mile course at 6,000 feet, Coogan completed the loop in 47 minutes. This was a big confidence boost, given that his time was comparable to Kenyans who have trained in Boulder, such as Lameck Aguta, the 1997 Boston Marathon champion, and Sammy Lelei, the second-fastest marathoner ever.
 Persistent hill workouts have prepared Coogan's legs for those final three rolling miles of Central Park, which can make a champion or break a contender.
"You want to be racing those last three or four miles, not surviving," Coogan said.
In September, during a 120-mile training week, Coogan was the top American finisher at the Philadelphia half-marathon in 1:03:02. That time was particularly encouraging, given that he defeated Jerry Lawson by more than two minutes and, a month later, Lawson set an American record for a loop course in 2:09:35 at the Chicago Marathon.
"I feel really good; this is definitely the best shape I've been in," Coogan said. "I've been focused all year."
He may have been expected to join Lawson in Chicago and skip New York. New Balance, the shoe company that represents Coogan, is offering $1 million this year to the runner who breaks Bob Kempainen's American record of 2:08:47, set at the 1994 Boston Marathon. It is an enticing carrot to dangle.
Chicago's course is flatter and easier than New York's. But it wasn't money he was after, Coogan said, it was the chance to prove himself in New York, to feel the energy of a city where two million people line the course on race day. As a high school runner, he kept a poster in his bedroom that showed the exultation of Rod Dixon winning the 1983 New York City Marathon and the despair of Geoff Smith, who had been caught and passed after 26 miles.
"Boston, New York, the Olympics, those are my big three," Coogan said. "I want to feel the energy, the hype of the largest single-day spectator event, the heart-pounding good time. Bill Rodgers, Salazar, all the great ones have run New York."
Coogan has been training with the 1988 winner, Steve Jones, and with such other New York veterans as Mark Plaatjes and Arturo Barrios. They have given him pointers: run patiently, don't panic if your legs and feet feel strange as you run over the Queensboro Bridge, don't let the cheering on First Avenue shift you into overdrive with 10 miles left. He has also watched videotapes of previous races, observing how Kempainen smartly ran the tangents to finish second in 1993.
A victory for Coogan would mean a doubling in prize money from $50,000 to $100,000 because he is an American, and it would quadruple the respect that American marathoners now receive in a sport dominated by Africans, Mexicans, Spaniards, Koreans and Japanese. He chafes at the criticism of Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic champion, who believes that Americans run too frequently for road-race money and don't preserve their legs for major races.
"In Kenya, the average yearly income is $500," Coogan said. "If you win a $10,000 race, that's 20 years of income. If I make $10,000, it's four months' income. I have to race more; I've got a daughter, a mortgage. Running is like a full-time job on a part-time salary."
Once, marathoners ran at a sustained pace; now, with Africans at the forefront, runners go out hard and "the one who dies the least wins," he said.
Coogan added: "Look at the years Billy Rodgers won New York in the 70's. How many Kenyan runners were there? Or Ethiopians? Probably zero. Now the whole world is running. That's the difference. If an American wins New York, maybe it will get people off our backs."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL;
Excerpts From Greenspan's Testimony

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony yesterday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress: 
 Mr. Chairman and committee members, we meet against the background of considerable turbulence in world financial markets. . . .
We need to assess these developments against the backdrop of a continuing impressive performance of the American economy in recent months. Growth appears to have remained robust and inflation low, and even falling, despite an ever-tightening labor market. . . .
Even after the sharp rebound around the world in the past 24 hours, declines in stock markets in the United States and elsewhere have left investors less wealthy than they were a week ago and businesses facing higher equity cost of capital. Yet, provided the decline in financial markets does not cumulate, it is quite conceivable that a few years hence, we will look back at this episode, as we now look back at the 1987 crash, as a salutary event in terms of its implications for the macroeconomy.
The 1987 crash occurred at a time when the American economy was operating with a significant degree of inflationary excess that the fall in market values arguably neutralized. Today's economy, as I have been suggesting of late, has been drawing down unused labor resources at an unsustainable pace, spurred in part by a substantial wealth effect on demand. The market's net retrenchment of recent days will tend to damp that impetus, a development that should help to prolong our six-and-a-half-year business expansion.
As I have testified previously, much of the stock price gain since early 1995 seems to have reflected upward revisions of long-term earnings expectations, which were implying a continuing indefinite rise in profit margins from already high levels. I suspect we are experiencing some scaling back of the projected gains in foreign affiliate earnings, and investors probably are revisiting expectations of domestic earnings growth. Still, the foundation for good business performance remains solid. . . .
There is much that is encouraging in the recent performance of the American economy, but, as I have often mentioned before, fundamental change comes slowly and we need to evaluate the prospective balance of supply and demand for various productive resources in deciding policy. . . .
The underlying technology-based structure of the international financial system has enabled us to improve materially the efficiency of the flows of capital and payment systems. That improvement, however, has also enhanced the ability of the financial system to transmit problems in one part of the globe to another quite rapidly. The recent turmoil is a case in point. . . .
The shifts in perceived future investment risks led to sharp declines in stock markets across Asia, often on top of earlier declines or lackluster performances. To date, the direct impact of these developments on the American economy has been modest, but it can be expected not to be negligible. . . .
Particularly troublesome over the past several months has been the so-called contagion effect of weakness in one economy spreading to others as investors perceive, rightly or wrongly, similar vulnerabilities. Even economies, such as Hong Kong, with formidable stocks of international reserves, balanced external accounts and relatively robust financial systems, have experienced severe pressures in recent days. One can debate whether the recent turbulence in Latin American asset values reflect contagion effects from Asia, the influence of developments in U.S. financial markets or home-grown causes. Whatever the answer, and the answer may be all of the above, this phenomenon illustrates the interdependencies in today's world economy and financial system. . . .
The financial disturbances that have afflicted a number of currencies in Asia do not at this point, as I indicated earlier, threaten prosperity in this country, but we need to work closely with their leaders and the international financial community to assure that their situations stabilize. It is in the interest of the United States and other nations around the world to encourage appropriate policy adjustments and where required, provide temporary financial assistance.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE POLICY MAKER;
Greenspan Sees A Silver Lining In Stock Unrest

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, broke his silence today over the turmoil in the stock market and proclaimed it not such a bad thing after all.
Speaking to a Congressional committee -- and to investors around the world who were hanging on his every phrase -- Mr. Greenspan said the plunge in markets, even though apparently short lived, could diminish the risks of an outbreak in inflation by venting some steam from an economy that has been threatening to overheat. 
 The stock market rallied sharply on his statements but fell back later in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a gain of 8.35 points, at 7,506.67. Page D1.
Mr. Greenspan suggested that the harrowing 7.2 percent fall and 4.7 percent rebound in stock prices on Monday and Tuesday could provide consumers with a needed reality check. Consumers have been driving the economy's strong growth by spending freely and amassing considerable new debt, partly because the market's breathtaking rise over the last few years had left them feeling well off even if they were not cashing in their investment gains.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan said the economy would also be slowed slightly by the economic problems plaguing Asia, where the market turmoil originated. Exports to that region could decline, he said, and imports from Asia would cost less. That would help restrain inflation in the United States because the plunging value of Asian currencies has made goods from that part of the world less expensive if bought in dollars.
As the policy maker most able to influence markets in the United States and abroad, Mr. Greenspan clearly intended to help calm investors' frazzled nerves by providing an upbeat assessment of the wild swings of the last few days.
Although he had dropped a broad hint in Congressional testimony three weeks ago that the current combination of strong growth and low unemployment could soon begin pushing wages and prices higher and require the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, he avoided any suggestion today that he saw imminent danger from inflation.
Mr. Greenspan has in many ways been the stock market's pre-eminent bear since he asked last December whether investors were suffering from "irrational exuberance." So it was perhaps not surprising that he would emphasize the positive today, two days after the Dow average tumbled 554 points and markets around the world trembled.
He even drew a parallel to the aftermath of the 1987 market crash, which is now widely viewed as having done little economic damage while providing a marvelous stock-buying opportunity for investors.
"Even after the sharp rebound around the world in the past 24 hours, declines in markets in the United States and elsewhere have left investors less wealthy than they were a week ago and businesses facing higher equity cost of capital," Mr. Greenspan said. "Yet, provided the decline in financial markets does not cumulate, it is quite conceivable that a few years hence, we will look back at this episode, as we now look back at the 1987 crash, as a salutary event in terms of its implications for the economy."
The strong economy has been pushing unemployment steadily lower, increasing the odds that wages will begin rising in a way that could push up inflation, he said. The strong demand for goods and services, he said, is caused partly by a "substantial wealth effect," a reference to a belief among consumers that they can spend more because their investments are doing so well.
"The market's net retrenchment of recent days will tend to damp that impetus, a development that should help to prolong our six-and-a-half-year business expansion," Mr. Greenspan said.
Asked whether stocks were now priced more realistically, Mr. Greenspan, who had said several times this year that investors seemed to have a very optimistic view of future corporate earnings, replied that valuations were now "less out of line" than they had been.
Mr. Greenspan, in two hours of testimony before Congress's Joint Economic Committee, said the economy's performance in recent months had been "impressive."
"Growth appears to have remained robust and inflation low, and even falling, despite an ever-tightening labor market," he said.
He attributed the stock market's problems to the troubles afflicting the Asian economies and markets, and on the likelihood that profits of American companies operating in that region would be hurt. But he said that if the Asian markets had not caused American investors to begin reassessing how long the remarkable bull market could last, something else would have.
Mr. Greenspan reiterated his belief that productivity growth was picking up, giving the economy greater capacity to expand without inflation. But he stressed that gains in productivity -- output of a worker in an hour -- were not sufficient to erase his concerns that continued declines in unemployment from the current 4.9 percent rate would eventually create inflationary increases in wages and prices.
Short-term interest rates set by the central bank are high by historical standards when adjusted for inflation, he said. But these relatively high rates have shown no signs of restricting activity in rate-sensitive areas of the economy like housing and therefore should not be considered terribly tight, he added.
The Federal Reserve has left its Federal funds target rate at 5.5 percent since March, but declining inflation since has pushed up the inflation-adjusted "real" rate to about 3.3 percent this year from 2.8 percent. For the last three decades the real Federal funds rate has averaged about 2 percent.
On problems overseas, Mr. Greenspan said it was in the national interest to provide temporary financial assistance to nations like those in Asia that are struggling economically. His statement appeared intended to buttress a growing consensus within the Clinton Administration that the United States should provide more support to Asia to help settle the financial markets.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony supported a widespread view on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve was almost certain to leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting on Nov. 12, and probably at the following meeting on Dec. 16.
However, the Fed could be caught in an uncomfortable situation if economic statistics over the next week and a half show the economy growing at a rapid pace and unemployment declining sharply. The Government's first estimate of growth in third-quarter gross domestic product will be issued on Friday. The unemployment report for October will be released a week later.
But a report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showed few signs that wage increases were accelerating, and a summary of conditions around the country released by the Fed today concluded that prices and wages were relatively stable.
Even if new economic reports showed some tentative evidence of inflation, analysts said, the Fed would err on the side of keeping the markets calm and avoid raising rates at least until early next year.

Remarks by Greenspan Soothe Shaken Markets
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, tried to calm nervous financial markets by suggesting that the recent turmoil in stocks was a healthy reality check that had lowered prices and could help repress inflation.
Mr. Greenspan's assessment during Congressional testimony was well received in the markets, which viewed it as powerful evidence that the Fed would not raise interest rates at a November meeting. Page A1. 

Bonds rallied on Mr. Greenspan's remarks, pushing the 30-year Treasury yield down to 6.20 percent from 6.28. D8.
 
Business Agreements With China
At the summit meeting in Washington, China agreed to buy $3 billion worth of aircraft from Boeing and to make concessions that clear the way for American companies to bid on commercial nuclear power contracts in China that are potentially worth $60 billion. A1.
 
Waste Management Chief Quits
The chief executive of Waste Management, Ronald T. LeMay, quit, the second chief to leave the troubled trash hauling company in nine months. Mr. LeMay will return to Sprint, which he left in July. D4.
 
Silicon Graphics in Shake-Up
Silicon Graphics said that its chairman and chief executive, Edward R. McCracken, would step down as chief executive as soon as a successor could be found. The company, which had surprised Wall Street by announcing a widening of its quarterly loss, also said it would cut 700 to 1,000 jobs. D6.
 
Reports Show Growth Easing
More evidence of steady or slower growth emerged when the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods fell in September for the first time in three months, and a Fed regional survey showed no sign of inflationary price or wage pressures. D4.
 
Two Regional Retailers to Join
Proffitts, a regional department store company, said it would buy Carson Pirie Scott, another retailer, for about $790 million, creating the fourth-largest department store chain. Carson stock soared. D2.
 
Viacom Operating Profit Falls
Viacom's quarterly profit from continuing operations slid 83 percent as problems at the Blockbuster video chain offset higher earnings at the MTV and Nickelodeon cable channels. Analysts had predicted a loss, though only after the company had warned them that their expectations were too high. D11.
 
New Approach to Fighting Fraud
Federal regulators are turning up the heat on some of Wall Street's biggest firms, which process the trades of smaller operations, in an effort to prevent some small firms from defrauding investors who trade in the stocks of tiny companies. D6.
 
PNC Seen Buying Stake in Broker
PNC Bank is buying 4.9 percent of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, an institutional brokerage firm, for about $45 million, people involved with the negotiations said. The firm is also arranging to sell a further 17.3 percent of its stock in an initial public offering. D6.
 
Columbia/HCA Earnings Fall
Columbia/HCA Healthcare said that its earnings had dropped significantly in the third quarter, in the wake of a widespread criminal investigation of some of the company's business practices. D4.
 
Mercedes Moves to Fix Problem
Mercedes-Benz said that it would spend $57 million a year to install electronic equipment on its new A-class subcompact cars to correct a design problem that caused one of the cars to flip during a sharp turn in a test. D7.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE FACTS;
Both Sides Manipulate Data to Fit

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
In last night's final debate of the mayoral campaign, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Ruth W. Messinger showed off the wiles of political oratory, the timeless art of trying to pummel an opponent with facts that have been stripped of their contexts, nuances and caveats.
Ms. Messinger, for example, proclaimed twice in the debate that Mr. Giuliani had cut $6 billion from education, as she has said repeatedly during the campaign. She left the impression that the budget for the Board of Education is now $6 billion less than it was when Mr. Giuliani became Mayor. In truth, education spending has increased during the Mayor's tenure. 
 The $6 billion refers to requests by the Board of Education for new money that Mr. Giuliani rejected, rather than a cut in money already allocated. About $4.7 billion of the money would have been used for school construction and repairs over several years. The board had said it wanted the money to respond to many needs, including soaring enrollment. Ms. Messinger has argued that in spurning the request, the Mayor showed he did not care about the public schools.
Mr. Giuliani said, early in his tenure, that the board was doing a poor job of managing the school system, so new money might have been wasted. Either way, the $6 billion is a cut in the projected growth of spending, not in money that the city had already distributed.
The Mayor responded to Ms. Messinger's attack last night by saying that spending per pupil was now at the highest level ever. But that does not take inflation into account. A study by the city's Independent Budget Office found that overall spending per pupil by the Board of Education has actually declined over the last decade when adjusted for inflation, largely because spending has not kept pace with enrollment, which has been increasing by nearly 20,000 students a year.
Mr. Giuliani said he had added 88,000 classroom seats to the school system during his tenure, and promised to add more in a second term. But the Mayor's aides have acknowledged that many of the new seats added over the last four years were planned under his predecessor, Mayor David N. Dinkins.
In discussing the economy, Ms. Messinger said, "60 percent of the jobs that have been created in this city have gone to people who live outside this city." She was apparently basing that statement on an August report by City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi. But her assertion is not supported by the report, which says that while suburban residents got more jobs in one period -- the first half of 1997 -- city residents generally have received more jobs during the rest of the Mayor's tenure.
Toward the end of the debate, Ms. Messinger said Mr. Giuliani's re-election campaign had refused to return $1 million in illegal campaign contributions until the city's Campaign Finance Board threatened sanctions. While the Mayor's campaign has returned that money, it gave back much of it before the board said it would impose penalties.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Female Refs Say They Owe Their Jobs to Their Ability

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
First, there was Commissioner David Stern sending accusations at the players association's executive director, Billy Hunter. Then there were two female officials on the cusp of making history.
Only labor peace and gender equity were at stake yesterday in the National Basketball Association. 
 While Stern and Hunter engaged in a skirmish over the concerns of marijuana use in the league, Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner granted the only interviews they plan to during their careers as officials.
The two women were mostly candid about their appointment by the N.B.A. to referee games during the 1997-98 season. Their assignments over the weekend will mark the first time female referees have officiated in America's four major professional sports leagues.
"I'm not worried about a pat on the behind," Kantner said, laughing. "As long it's in the context of the game, those things don't bother me."
Ask about curbing the behavior of irascible players like Charles Barkley, Dennis Rodman and Anthony Mason, Palmer added, "We'll treat them like any other players."
"Confrontation is part of being a referee," she said. "If they cross a line, they'll be assessed a technical foul."
Kantner, 37, and Palmer, 33, have worked preseason games for the last two years for the N.B.A. Both have extensive officiating experience and both shot down the notion they were merely politically correct pawns for the league.
"I think I speak for Dee when I say that we were selected on our ability," Palmer said.
Kantner labeled reports of sexism and criticism by current players "sensationalism," and insisted she had had nothing but positive responses to her work so far. "Now, I'm not Pollyanna in thinking that nothing is going to happen, but I haven't had a problem to date that I've been concerned about."
To accept the positions, Kantner resigned her job as a sales engineer in North Carolina and Palmer resigned her position as a recreation director in Southern California. In keeping with the secrecy policy involving officials, neither the league nor the women would disclose where they will work their first games this weekend.
They were guarded regarding their roles in breaking another barrier in American sport, preferring instead to view themselves as two qualified individuals intent on working at the game's highest level.
"I don't think Violet or I could ever say we would be trailblazers when we started out," Kantner said. "We're both a little awed by the attention. But if one of the after-effects of this is that it helps open up more doors, we're both all for it."
Meanwhile, in an early afternoon conference call, Stern warned of the potentially contentious give-and-take that may take place between the owners and the players over the next year. But in the end, the commissioner said, the two sides would eventually break bread together with the intent of preserving labor peace.
Given yesterday's skirmish, they have a long way to go.
Within hours after Stern criticized the players association for its refusal to address the league's concern over marijuana use, Hunter fired off a scathing statement aimed at Stern's "misrepresentation of the issue."
Stern was responding to an article in The New York Times last Sunday regarding use of marijuana by players, with some estimates as high as 70 percent. The league's current drug policy includes testing for cocaine and heroin, but it does not include marijuana.
Saying the players association was only interested in discussing the issue if economic concessions were involved, Stern said he was puzzled at Hunter's apathy.
"This was not about punishment and exclusion," Stern said. "We're dumbfounded by the approach. We'd like to cut down the use of marijuana, educate and identify the problem. But apparently Mr. Hunter has a different agenda."
In his statement, however, Hunter outlined the highlights of the league's most recent proposal to the players, a 41-page document that he said includes punishment and exclusion. Accusing Stern of trying "to sway public opinion and to gain an edge in upcoming collective bargaining negotiations," Hunter disputed the commissioner's position.
According to Hunter, the most recent proposal calls for a five-game suspension if a player tests positive, pleads guilty or is convicted of a marijuana offense. The N.B.A. seeks an automatic six-month suspension in the event of a second offense. If a player distributes marijuana, the league calls for a lifetime ban.
"To accuse us of stonewalling is false and self-serving," Hunter said in the statement. "If the commissioner is really interested in advising and educating our players, then we invite him to engage in more than rhetoric."
More propaganda will spew forth from both sides over the next few months, all of which may have serious ramifications on the prospective re-opening of the collective bargaining agreement in April. The owners have the right to open the agreement and begin negotiating a new one.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE TRADING;
Stocks Mixed As Volatility Seems to Ease

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
A day after one of the biggest stock market rallies in history, and two days after one of the biggest selloffs, Wall Street calmed down a bit yesterday, ending with mixed results despite continued heavy trading volume.
In fact, it was the first time in a week that the stock market did not rise or fall sharply, a hint that the economic turbulence that has rattled markets from Thailand to Tokyo, and all the way to New York, might be subsiding, and that investor fears might have eased somewhat. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained a scant 8.35 points, to close at 7,506.67. Broader indexes were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.69 points, to 919.16, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller company issues had solid gains.
Trading activity, however, was extremely heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, where more than 777 million shares traded hands. It was the second-busiest day in history, after the 1.2 billion shares traded Tuesday, testing the technology might of Wall Street brokerage firms and exchanges, and causing delays at many discount brokerage firms.
And today, Asian markets resumed their slide, hurt in part by a drop in the December futures contract for the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which trades around the clock. Still, in afternoon trading the losses were much less severe than those earlier this week.
In late afternoon trading in Toyko, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 452.44 points, or 2.68 percent, at 16,404.60. The Nikkei surged 3.34 percent yesterday. Hong Kong's main stock index was down 6.7 percent at the midday break in trading today. Hong Kong stocks rose 18.82 percent yesterday.
Yesterday's gains around the world gave some investors hope that the economic crisis that is gripping much of Southeast Asia will not topple the bull markets in other, more prosperous, regions.
Investors might have also been soothed yesterday by remarks from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who told Congress that the economy continues to perform impressively. He added that the recent stock market selloff might later come to be viewed as a "salutary event," if it helps keep the economy in balance with more modest growth.
Some of the world's stock markets, however, continue to be clouded by uncertainty about whether the crisis in Southeast Asia might spread to other parts of the globe. Yesterday, several markets in Latin America continued to slide; in Brazil, the main stock index was down 6 percent, and in Argentina, one of the main indexes fell 3.5 percent.
And despite the rebound in the United States, the Dow is still down 7 percent in a week, and analysts said it would be some time before investors felt confident enough to bid prices up to the level they were at in August, when the Dow reached its peak of 8,259.31.
Some lingering uncertainty was evident yesterday, analysts said, as the Dow and other major indexes, though ending close to where they started the day, fluctuated wildly. Early in the day, the Dow was up 120 points; but by midafternoon it had fallen into losing territory, before closing with the slight gain.
"It's almost as though we've had a violent storm, and investors are just coming up from their storm shelters," said Hugh Johnson, a market analyst at the First Albany Corporation. "There's still a great deal of uncertainty about what the past week has meant."
Through all the recent turmoil, though, financial advisers and analysts continue to reassure investors that the American economy is healthy, corporate profits are strong, inflation is not a threat and interest rates are stable.
In fact, almost immediately after Monday's 554-point plunge in the Dow -- a drop that forced the Big Board to halt trading twice -- Wall Street analysts were mobilizing to contain what some feared could turn into a panic.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the bullish strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, announced that the firm was increasing its exposure to stocks. "Recent stock price declines have been more of a market event than an economic event," she said.
Others, like Edward Kerschner, the chief investment strategist at Paine Webber, insist that the troubles in Asia are not going to cut sharply into corporate profits in the United States and that investors should focus on their long-term objectives.
Mr. Kerschner contends that there is little risk in the United States market, and that the currency and economic crisis in Southeast Asia will not have a "material impact on corporate profits," because Asia does not account for a large enough share of United States profits.
Indeed, few people on Wall Street say that they think a crisis is at hand. There is some disagreement about how much of an impact the problems in Asia might have on American companies, but few see the end of the great bull run.
And other analysts said they had a sense, from Main Street and Wall Street, that the huge bout of selling that saw the Dow lose 900 points in four sessions through Monday, had subsided.
"The panic is over for now," said Eric Miller, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "But instead of a broad upsweep, we might just see a stutter-step market."
Following that pattern, technology stocks sold off on Monday, rocketed ahead of the pack on Tuesday, and then surrendered again to heavy selling yesterday.
Many small stocks gained yesterday, however. The market's flat performance might have obscured the fact that the buying was actually broader than it was on Tuesday, when the Dow leaped 337 points. Nearly two stocks gained for every one that lost ground on the Big Board, and smaller investors, like Donald Kelley, a retired engineer, jumped back into the market.
"I took a heck of a beating on Monday," said the 65-year-old Mr. Kelley, who lives in Florissant, Mo. "But I recouped half of it Tuesday."
The gyrations notwithstanding, Mr. Kelley -- who says he lost his job about six years ago -- has never looked back. "I was an engineer until they downsized me," he said. "I wasn't happy at the time, but they did me a favor because it gave me more time to watch my investments."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON;
Clinton and Jiang in Their Own Words: Sharing a Broad Agenda

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a joint news conference today by President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company. Mr. Jiang's remarks are through an interpreter unless otherwise indicated.
 
OPENING STATEMENTS
MR. CLINTON: Good afternoon. Mr. President, let me again say how pleased we are to welcome the leader of a great people with a remarkable civilization, history and culture, a people now with its focus on the future. Your visit gives us the opportunity and the responsibility to build a future that is more secure, more peaceful, more prosperous for both our people. To that end, I am pleased that we have agreed to regular summit meetings. I look forward to visiting China next year. . . . 
 We also have agreed to high-level dialogues between our Cabinet officials on a full range of security matters. And we will connect a presidential hot line to make it easier for us to confer at a moment's notice.
China and the United States share a profound interest in a stable, prosperous, open Asia. We've worked well together in convincing North Korea to end its dangerous nuclear program. Today President Jiang and I agreed we will urge Pyongyang to take part in four-party peace talks with South Korea. We also agreed to strengthen contacts between our militaries, including through a maritime agreement, to decrease the chances of miscalculation and increase America's ties to a new generation of China's military leaders.
A key to Asia's stability is a peaceful and prosperous relationship between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. I reiterated America's long-standing commitment to a one-China policy. . . .
I told President Jiang that we hoped the People's Republic and Taiwan would resume a constructive cross-strait dialogue and expand cross-strait exchanges. Ultimately, the relationship between the P.R.C. and Taiwan is for the Chinese themselves to determine, peacefully.
President Jiang and I agreed that the United States and China share a strong interest in stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction and other sophisticated weaponry in unstable regions and rogue states; notably, Iran. I welcome the steps China has taken and the clear assurances it has given today to help prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and related technology.
On the basis of these steps and assurances, I agreed to move ahead with the U.S.-China agreement for cooperation concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It will allow our companies to apply for licenses to sell equipment to Chinese nuclear power plants subject to U.S. monitoring. . . .
In both China and the United States, trade has been a critical catalyst for growth. China is the fastest-growing market in the world for our goods and services. Tomorrow, Boeing will sign a contract for the largest sale of airplanes to China in history: 50 jets valued at $3 billion. This contract will support tens of thousands of American jobs and provide China with a modern fleet of passenger planes.
Still, access to China's market remains restricted for many American goods and services. Just as China can compete freely and fairly in America, so our goods and services should be able to compete freely and fairly in China. The United States will do everything possible to bring China into the World Trade Organization as soon as possible, provided China improves access to its market. . . .
This is a broad agenda in which China and the United States share important interests that we can best advance by working together. But we also have fundamental differences, especially concerning human rights and religious freedom. I am convinced the best way to address them is directly and personally, as we did yesterday and today, and as we will continue to do until this issue is no longer before us. . . .
MR. JIANG: Ladies and gentlemen, a while ago I had an in-depth exchange of views with President Clinton on China-U.S. relations and of international and regional issues of mutual interest. The meeting was constructive and fruitful. President Clinton and I have agreed on identifying the goals for the development of a China-U.S. relationship oriented toward the 21st century. The two sides believe that efforts to realize this goal will promote the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the noble cause of world peace and development.
We both agree that our two countries share extensive common interests in important matters bearing on the survival and development of mankind, such as peace and development, economic cooperation and trade, the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and environment protection. Both sides are of the view that it is imperative to handle China-U.S. relations and properly address our differences in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit; and seeking common ground, while putting aside differences. . . .
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. President Jiang, for the past few years you have reiterated once and again that we need to take a long-term perspective and we should view China-U.S. relations from the perspective of the 21st century. Therefore, Mr. President, what measures will the Chinese Government make, and how can a sound and stable relationship between China and the United States be brought into the 21st century?
MR. JIANG: Your question reminded me of the first meeting that President Clinton and I had in Seattle when we agreed that we need to work to bring a world of prosperity, stability and peace into the 21st century.
The meeting that I had with President Clinton during my current trip to the United States was the fifth one that we had with one another. However, my visit is the first by a Chinese head of state to the United States in 12 years. And this shows that both sides are working together in taking many specific measures to achieve this goal. . . . There are a lot of works from ancient Chinese literature and culture describing the view that one should scale a great height in order to have a grander sight. And the development of modern science and technology also told us that if you have a greater height, you can see farther into the long distance. . . .
Q. We are told that you have asked even last night for the release of some political dissidents and the Chinese have not done so. Is it acceptable for China to refuse even such a modest gesture?
MR. CLINTON: Well, first of all, we had a long discussion about human rights. We discussed a lot of issues related to human rights, every conceivable aspect of it. And we have profound disagreements there. But that does not mean that this visit should not have occurred or that we don't have a big interest in continuing to work together.
After all, this interest that we have in working with China relates to the fact that we have common values and common interests related to preserving peace, to growing the economy, to stopping the spread of dangerous weapons. We have an agreement to fight narco-trafficking. We have an agreement to work together on the terrific environmental challenges we face right across the board. And so I think that you have to see this meeting in the context of that. But you shouldn't in any way minimize the steep differences that still remain between us over that issue.
Q. I'm with the People's Daily. I have a question for your Excellency, President Jiang Zemin. Why is the Taiwan issue the core issue in China-U.S. relations?
MR. JIANG: The three Sino-U.S. joint communiques all covered the question of Taiwan because this question is involving the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. The late Mr. Deng Xiaoping proposed the system of "one country, two systems" for the settlement of the Taiwan question and for the accomplishment of peaceful reunification of China, and this is the only correct policy.
However, we also are saying that we do not commit to renounce the use of force, but this is not directed at the compatriots in Taiwan but rather at the external forces attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs and at those who are attempting to achieve separation of the country or the independence of Taiwan.
I am very happy that I discussed this issue in clear-cut terms with President Clinton during my current trip, as we have done in our previous meetings. And I believe the joint statement that the two sides are going to release will also carry explicit explanations on the Taiwan issue.
Q. Mr. President -- a question actually for both Presidents. The shootings in Tiananmen Square were a turning point in U.S.-Chinese relations and caused many Americans to view China as a repressive country that crushes human rights. President Jiang, do you have an you have any regrets about Tiananmen? And, President Clinton, are you prepared to lift any of the Tiananmen sanctions? And if not, why not?
MR. JIANG: The political disturbance that occurred at the turn of spring and summer in 1989 seriously disrupted social stability and jeopardized state security. Therefore, the Chinese Government had to take necessary measures according to law to quickly resolve the matter to insure that our country enjoys stability and that our reform and opening up proceed smoothly. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese Government have long drawn the correct conclusion on this political disturbance. And facts have also proved that if a country with an over 1.2 billion population does not enjoy social and political stability, it cannot possibly have the situation of reform and opening up that we are having today. . . .
MR. CLINTON: To answer your question, first on the general point, I think it should be obvious to everyone that we have a very different view of the meaning of the events at Tiananmen Square. I believe that what happened and the aftermath and the continuing reluctance to tolerate political dissent has kept China from politically developing the level of support in the rest of the world that otherwise would have been developed. I also believe, as I said in my opening statement, that over the long-run, the societies of the 21st century that will do best will be those that are drawing their stability from their differences; that out of this whole harmony of different views there is a coherence of loyalty to the nation. Because everyone has their say, it enables people to accept, for example, the results of the elections that they don't agree with. And so we have a different view.
The depth of the view in the United States, I think, is nowhere better exemplified than in the so-called Tiananmen sanctions. We are the only nation the world, as far as I know, that still has sanctions on the books as a result of the events of eight years ago.
Now, you ask a specific question. Our agreement on nuclear proliferation issues allows me to lift the sanction on peaceful nuclear cooperation. It is the right thing to do for America. This is a good agreement. It furthers our national security interests. China is to be complimented for participating in it. And the decision is the right one.
The other sanctions, which cover a range of issues, from OPIC loans to crime control equipment and many things in between, under our law have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. So as a result of our meeting today, the only Tiananmen Square sanction which is being lifted is the one on peaceful nuclear cooperation, and it is a good thing for America, a good thing for China. And I applaud the Chinese side for the work they have done with us on this specific nuclear issue. It's a substantial step forward for us.
MR. JIANG: I would like to speak a few words in addition to this question. Our two countries have different geographical locations, and we are also thousands of miles apart geographically. We also have different historic and cultural traditions, different level of economic development and different values. Therefore, I believe it is just natural for our two countries to hold different views on some issues.
Now people in the world are standing at the turn of the century, when we're going to bring in the 21st century, and science and technology have developed significantly as compared with, for instance, the period when Newton lived. And I also believe that the world we are living in is a rich and diverse one; and therefore, the concepts on democracy, on human rights and on freedoms are relative and specific ones, and they are to be determined by the specific national situation of different countries. And I am also strongly of the view that, on such issues as the human rights issue, discussion can be held on the basis of noninterference in the internal affairs of a country. And it goes without saying that, as for the general rules universally abided by in the world, China also abides by these rules. . . .
Naturally, I am also aware that, in the United States, different views can be expressed, and this is a reflection of democracy. And therefore I would like to quote a Chinese saying which goes, "Seeing it once is better than hearing about it 100 times." I have also got my real understanding about this during my current trip. However, I don't believe this will have any negative impact on our efforts to approach each other.
MR. CLINTON: Let me -- I just have to say one other thing. First of all, the United States recognizes that on so many issues China is on the right side of history. And we welcome it. But on this issue we believe the policy of the government is on the wrong side of history. There is, after all, now a universal declaration of human rights.
The second point I'd like to make is that I can only speak from our experience. And America has problems of its own which I have frankly acknowledged. But in our country I think it would amaze many of our Chinese guests to see some of the things that have been written and said about me -- -- my family -- -- our Government, our policies. . . .
And yet after all this time I'm still standing here, and our country is stronger than it was before those words were uttered six years ago. . . .
Q. Mr. President, I have a question for both President Jiang and President Clinton.
President Clinton, you stated your position with regard to Taiwan, that this is a question for the Chinese people to resolve. But we all understand you have brokered peace in Bosnia, in the Middle East. Do you see any role for the United States to play in the securing of a permanent peaceful environment in the Taiwan Strait? . . .
My question to President Jiang is about the cross-strait dialogue. President Clinton said that he has urged President Jiang to resume the interrupted dialogue. I wonder if President Jiang will respond positively and take some measures to resume the dialogue as soon as possible.
MR. CLINTON: Well, first of all, I think the most important thing the United States can do to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the differences is to adhere strictly to the one-China policy we have agreed on; to make it clear that within the context of that one-China policy, as articulated in the communiques and our own laws, we will maintain friendly, open relations with the people of Taiwan and China, but that we understand that this issue has to be resolved and resolved peacefully, and that if it is resolved in a satisfactory way, consistent with statements made in the past, then Asia will be stronger and more stable and more prosperous. That is good for the United States, and our own relations with China will move onto another stage of success.
I think the more we can encourage that, the better off we are. But I think in the end, since so much investment and contact has gone on in the last few years between Taiwan and China, I think the Chinese people know how to resolve this when the time is right. And we just have to keep saying we hope the time will be right as soon as possible. Sooner is better than later. . . .
MR. JIANG: To answer your question in rather brief terms, all in all, our policy is one of peaceful reunification and one-country/two-systems. And as for more detailed elaboration on that, a few years ago, I made my eight-point proposal along that line, and at the just-concluded 15th national congress of the Chinese Communist Party, I also delivered a report which gave a rather comprehensive elaboration on this. Therefore, I will not repeat them here. . . .
Q. Mr. President, could you elaborate a little bit more on your decision to approve these reactor -- or to permit reactor sales? It's certainly something that raised concerns by some members of Congress. And also, could you just describe what kind of commitments you've received from China? Are they actually written?
MR. CLINTON: Well, let me say, first of all, I am completely convinced that the agreements we have reached are sufficiently specific and clear that the requirements of the law will be met and that the national security of the United States will be advanced, and that we will have greater success in our global efforts to keep nuclear technology and other dangerous weapons from falling into the wrong hands, as a result of the agreement we have made with China. . . .
Q. Mr. President, the United States and China are inevitably big powers in the Pacific. Are you comfortable with the size of America's military presence in Asia? I'd also like to ask President Jiang if he would view a reduction of American troops in the region as a step towards improving relations.
MR. CLINTON: The question you ask of me, the answer is simple. It's yes. I believe that our presence in the Pacific, where everyone knows we have no territorial or other destructive ambitions, is a stabilizing factor. And it will lead us to greater partnerships in meeting common security threats in the years ahead. . . .
Q. . . . Yesterday Beijing has announced its invitation for Russian President Boris Yeltsin to visit Beijing. And today the heads of state of China and the United States have announced here in the United States to establish a constructive and strategic partnership between China and the United States. Therefore, I would like to have your comment -- the two Presidents -- your perception concerning the triangular relationship between China, the United States and Russia.
MR. JIANG: I don't see much contradiction in this aspect, for I am coming here to the United States this time at the invitation of President Clinton for what is our fifth meeting with one another, and therefore, we are already old friends. And so am I with President Yeltsin with Russia. And I still remember that in the spring of 1995, the three of us met in Moscow. Therefore, I don't see much contradiction in this regard. And we should all commit ourselves to building a peaceful and beautiful new century.
MR. CLINTON: During the cold war, we were all three suspicious of each other and we tried to play each other off against the other. So when Russia fought with China -- argued with China, we were very happy.
Today we must look to the future. Russia has a strong democracy. Its economy is coming back. We are working with Russia in Bosnia and in other places around the world. In land mass, it is the largest country in the world; it is a rich country. It is a European country and an Asian country. And both China and the United States should have good relations with Russia, and then the three of us should work together on matters of common concern. This is not the cold war. We need to be looking to the future and a different set of relations.
Q. Mr. President, and Mr. President, I wonder if you specifically had a chance to raise the cases of the two leading political dissidents in China -- Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng -- with President Jiang and ask for their release?
And to President Jiang, why not simply release these political prisoners? And also, why not allow greater religious freedom in Tibet, which has become such an emotional issue here in the United States as well?
MR. CLINTON: First, as Mr. Berger I think has already told you, my answer to that question is, I discussed every aspect of this issue in great detail.
MR. JIANG: To be frank with you, President Clinton discussed all these relevant issues with me. And I just want to state here that I am the President of the People's Republic of China, not the chief judge of the Supreme Court of China. And as for the issues such as the one concerning Wei Jingsheng, this involves China's criminal law and will be resolved gradually according to the legal procedure by the court of China.
As for the issue concerning religion in Tibet, in China people have the freedom to exercise their different religious beliefs. However, on this question I believe religious freedom in Tibet and the evaluation of criminal law are issues within different framework. . . .
Q. My question is for President Clinton. In China, sometimes we are confused by American policy to China. We know there are sections in Congress which are friendly to China. So, as President, how do you coordinate the unbalance to have a unified policy to China? Is there any elements to damage effective Sino-U.S. relationship?
MR. CLINTON: Well, let me say -- make a general point first. It is very important that we understand each other so that if we have a difference, it's a real difference and not a misunderstanding. Therefore, in dealing with the United States, unless there is some clear signal to the contrary, you should assume that a statement by the president, the vice president, the secretary of State, the secretary of Defense, the secretary of the Treasury, the National Security Adviser, the Trade Ambassador -- the people in our direct line of authority, they represent our policy.
We need the support of important people in Congress, and much of the leadership does support this administration's China policy. But I think it would be a mistake to think that the United States has no unified China policy because individuals or groups in the Congress disagree with it. We do have a lot of disagreement; we have had for eight years now -- ever since 1989. Until we resolve all these issues, in that sense our relations will never be fully normal, but we have to keep pushing forward. . . .
Q. My question is for President Jiang. . . . Officials in the delegation have suggested that the protesters who have protested Chinese policies in Tibet, are in many cases, young people, students who have been misguided and misinformed by a Hollywood-led campaign. Sir, if that is so, and if we take to heart your old Chinese saying that "seeing once is worth hearing a hundred times," would you be willing to invite either a senior delegation from the United States Congress or a group of international journalists to travel to Tibet and to see for themselves?
(Interpreter, in Chinese, says "travel to China" instead of "travel to Tibet," and members of audience say "to Tibet.")
MR. JIANG: I do indeed -- would like to welcome more people to go to Tibet and see with their own eyes.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE ISSUES;
Mayor Has Helped Stabilize the Budget, but Avoided a Promised Overhaul

SERIES: RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Incumbent's Record

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
When Rudolph W. Giuliani was a candidate in 1993, he pledged to take a scalpel to New York City's budget, cutting spending, taxes and the work force, all in a crusade to end chronic deficits and rouse a local economy that had been thrashed by the recession. He vowed, in short, to administer a dose of hard-nosed fiscal conservatism to one of the most expansive governments in the nation.
Four years later, the city's economy is rebounding from its prolonged slump and its budget is sturdier than at any time in nearly a decade. Throughout his re-election campaign, Mr. Giuliani has said that his policies helped lead to a net gain of more than 170,000 private-sector jobs in the city. He says he guided municipal finances through a difficult period of retrenchment without harming essential services or laying off city workers. 
 Mr. Giuliani notes often that he pushed through cuts in taxes on hotel rooms, commercial rents, small-business earnings, the sale of some clothing, and co-ops and condominiums. And he speaks of his efforts to reduce what he terms another kind of tax: the extra costs that businesses have had to shoulder because the garbage hauling industry, the Fulton Fish Market and other wholesale markets were long dominated by organized crime. His administration has helped to break up these cartels.
Yet, despite all that, the Mayor has not always achieved his goals. Though he has trimmed some programs, the city's spending has actually increased. In his first year, he pushed through an aggressive plan to cut the budget and the city work force, but since then, he has scaled back, arguing that the city could take only so much austerity.
In general, he has shied away from the far-reaching overhaul of the budget that he promised, failing to cure many of the city's long-term financial ills, including the persistent budget gaps that he had said he would eliminate.
The current budget is stable because soaring profits on Wall Street have sent a torrent of taxes into the city treasury, but that good fortune has masked the city's continuing inability to deal with a longstanding problem: its expenses are rising faster than its revenues.
Mr. Giuliani has cut the number of city employees paid for with city revenues by about 20,000, to roughly 200,000, largely through an innovative severance program. But that is less than the reduction of 35,000 that he promised as a candidate four years ago. He has not shown much stomach for paring labor costs, the largest component of the budget, by adopting the kind of privatization and productivity measures that he once supported and that other cities have embraced -- initiatives that would have forced a politically exacting confrontation with the powerful municipal unions.
While the economy has improved, the net gain in private-sector jobs has still not made up for a drop of 342,000 private-sector jobs in the recession that began in the late 1980's. Most other large cities recovered the jobs they lost in the recession years ago. And over the last year, New York City's unemployment rate has remained at more than 9 percent, nearly double the national average and among the highest rates of any major city in the country.
"There are still fundamental weaknesses throughout New York City's economy," said Robert A. Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, a leading bond-rating concern.
Mr. Giuliani maintains that the city was in such bad fiscal condition when he became Mayor that he could not accomplish all he wanted in just one term. He said he gets carping from both sides, some saying he cut too much, destroying the city's social fabric, while others say he cut too little and is letting the government stay a drag on the local economy.
"You've got to live in the world of the realistic," Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. He later added: "I understand, the monitors always want more. But I have to be ultimately responsible for balancing the budget of the city. Which means how much can you do this year, without threatening public safety, schools, health."
While Mr. Giuliani takes credit for the growth in private-sector jobs during his tenure, few economists believe that a mayor has much direct impact on the local economy, which is more tied to national and, increasingly, international trends. For example, the city has been steadily losing manufacturing jobs in recent decades as factories decamp for places with cheaper labor, transportation and other costs, and it would be extremely difficult for any mayor to forestall that.
But some economists praise Mr. Giuliani for improving the business climate by working to reduce crime, lowering business taxes, cracking down on organized crime and seeking to make his administration more receptive to the concerns of business than its predecessors.
"The things that do come under his control that have been drag on the economy in the past, he has lessened them," said Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Using what power he has to preserve and generate jobs in private industries, the Mayor has handed out more than $650 million in tax breaks and other incentives to big corporations that threaten to leave the city. He defends the policy as clearly to the city's benefit, saying that the companies receiving the inducements give far more back in taxes. But his critics deride the spending as wasteful and say Mr. Giuliani should have concentrated more on helping medium-size and small businesses.
The Mayor has much more control over the city's own spending, and he can shape the budget to minimize the effect of economic downturns or benefit from upswings. Mr. Giuliani often contends, for example, that if the city's spending had increased at the same rate over the last four years that it did during the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins, all the extra taxes generated by Wall Street in the last year would have been spent and there would not have been a $1.4 billion surplus at the end of 1997 fiscal year in June.
And he says that after pushing through three austere budgets, he remained disciplined and did not sharply increase city spending when tax revenues from Wall Street began soaring last year -- though he did allocate more money for some programs, particularly at the Board of Education, trying to bolster his record on education, which Democrats had repeatedly attacked.
By some gauges, the Mayor has not made much progress in solving the city's financial problems. The city's long-term debt has risen during his term; nearly 20 percent of the city budget now goes toward paying off principal and interest. And the city's bond rating is still low.
Some experts say that despite Mr. Giuliani's assertions that the city's fiscal health has improved, large budget gaps projected for comong fiscal years underscore how the Mayor has not brought about the sweeping reforms he vowed.
"He gave up on reinventing government," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses. "He has basically frozen the existing way of doing things. That doesn't mean that he hasn't done some good things with respect to some services. But as to his general approach to re-engineering or restructuring government, he has been very much in the tradition of his predecessors."

Williams Rates Best in the A.L. For Outfielders

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
While the Yankees' center fielder emerged yesterday as the top-ranked outfielder in the American League, the center fielder of the archrival Baltimore Orioles emerged as one of the top rank of free agents the Yankees covet.
The annual ranking statistics that were released yesterday show that Bernie Williams is No. 1, ahead of Ken Griffey Jr., the player many consider baseball's best. A day earlier, the Yankees registered their interest in the sixth-ranked outfielder, Brady Anderson. 
 Bob Watson, the Yankees' general manager, declined to comment on the team's initial pursuit of Anderson, but Jeff Borris, who represents him, confirmed that the Yankees were one of many teams to call since Anderson declared his free agency Monday.
Economic competition for Anderson would mark the start of a third successive off season of free-agent battles between the Orioles and the Yankees. Two winters ago, the teams played a game of can-you-top-this as the signing of a free agent by one team prompted the signing of another free agent by the other team. Last winter, the Orioles signed the Yankees' Jimmy Key, and then the Yankees signed the Orioles' David Wells.
Adding Anderson to their lineup would not only give the Yankees a potent leadoff hitter, which they have lacked, but it would also deprive the Orioles of a player who has been integral to their recent success. To join the Yankees, though, Anderson would have to move to left field, at least as long as Williams is around.
"We didn't talk about Bernie or where Brady would play," Borris said. "He likes center field; he'd prefer center. But I don't think he'd have any problem playing left."
Borris said he was surprised that Anderson has reached this juncture with the Orioles.
"Baltimore has made several offers since August a year ago, but nothing came close to reflecting the current market," Borris said by telephone from his office in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Borris recalled that the Orioles signed Cal Ripken Jr. and Mike Mussina to contract extensions early in the season, and he said he expected that Anderson would be next. But it never happened. The Orioles last offered about $5.5 million a year for four years, but Anderson reportedly wanted closer to $8 million a year.
However, his production this year plunged. In 1996, he hit 50 home runs and drove in 110 runs. This year he hit 18 home runs and knocked in 73 runs.
The Yankees, meanwhile, didn't need the news of Williams's place in the rankings because they already face a difficult task in signing him to a multiyear contract and to keep him from becoming a free agent after next season. Williams has risen steadily in the rankings, from seventh to fourth a year ago, then to No. 1 this year.
With the rankings by positions based on two years worth of five offensive statistics, Williams had a 5.4 average rank in those categories to a 6.0 average for Griffey. Williams ranked 10th in home runs among 84 outfielders to first for Griffey, but Griffey was hurt by his being 13th in batting average to 5th for Williams and 12th in on-base percentage to 6th for Williams.
Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' closer, was No. 1 among American League relief pitchers. Seattle had two top-ranked players, shortstop Alex Rodriguez and designated hitter Edgar Martinez. Other A.L. players ranked No. 1 were catcher Ivan Rodriguez of Texas, first baseman Frank Thomas of Chicago, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch of Minnesota, third baseman Matt Williams of Cleveland and the starting pitcher Pat Hentgen of Toronto.
Andy Pettitte placed second to Hentgen, and Derek Jeter was third behind Rodriguez and Jay Bell of Kansas City.
Top-ranked players in the National League were Jeff Bagwell of Houston at first, Craig Biggio of Houston at second, Barry Larkin of Cincinnati at shortstop, Ken Caminiti of San Diego at third, Barry Bonds of San Francisco in the outfield, Mike Piazza of Los Angeles at catcher, John Smoltz of Atlanta the starting pitcher and Trevor Hoffman of San Diego the relief pitcher.
 
INSIDE PITCH
TIM RAINES, whose contract option was not exercised by the Yankees, was one of 14 players who filed for free agency yesterday. Others joining him were DENNIS ECKERSLEY of St. Louis, HAROLD BAINES of Baltimore, CHILI DAVIS of Kansas City, OREL HERSHISER of Cleveland and JOSE VIZCAINO of San Francisco.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: PROFILE -- Politics as Lifelong Passion;
McGreevey of New Jersey Is a Relentless Competitor

SERIES: RACE FOR GOVERNOR: The Democrat -- Second of three profiles.

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
He used to shed his suits on weekends, strap a canoe to his car and head to the Delaware River, where a gentle landscape and the company of friends distracted James Edward McGreevey, ever so briefly, from his ambitions.
But even on the river, Mr. McGreevey could not allow himself to float. If there were two canoes, friends recall, he would insist on racing for hours at a stretch. He would study the route like a textbook, craning his neck to assess every bend as his fellow canoers fought the urge to toss him overboard. 
 "Jim would be all worked up, shouting, looking down the river far enough to know when we would really need to push," said James Kennedy, a close friend of Mr. McGreevey's. "I can remember my arms burning like crazy and me thinking, 'Why are we doing this?' "
He no longer makes time for canoeing, but Mr. McGreevey, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey, continues to approach every project -- and he makes sure there are always several lined up -- with manic energy and a will to conquer. The people who know him best say these qualities, combined with his "hey, guys" schmoozy personality, explain why he has never lost an election -- he is a state senator and the Mayor of Woodbridge -- and never faces a day without a plan.
His critics say the source of Mr. McGreevey's energy is implacable political ambition that makes him seem eerily hollow at times. They say that while Mr. McGreevey can charm and connect with people from all social strata, he lacks convictions and a coherent vision.
"I couldn't tell you what his guiding political philosophy is, and I don't think he could, either," said David Bixel, Mr. McGreevey's history teacher at St. Joseph's High School in Metuchen, who has followed his student's career. "I would have to say at this juncture he seems more guided by his ambition."
But friends and family members say Mr. McGreevey is driven by a lifelong devotion to public service that overshadows every other aspect of his life. It is why he collected three academic degrees in seven years, became a state official at 28 and began running for office at 32, they say. Mr. McGreevey himself says it was his preoccupation with politics that sent his wife, Kari, back to her native Canada with their daughter in 1995, after four years of marriage.
"I know no one who gets such personal satisfaction from his career choice as Jim does," said James Burns, a lawyer who grew up around the corner from Mr. McGreevey in Carteret. "It's not driven by greed or any of the things that would otherwise motivate people. Jim is driven by a very internal, personal thing."
Mr. McGreevey's father, a former drill instructor in the Marines, taught his young son a mantra that stuck: Plan your work and work your plan. With those words in mind, Mr. McGreevey mapped out a route that included law school, a stint in the Middlesex County prosecutor's office and two years as a staff lawyer for the Assembly Democrats in Trenton, where he made sure people remembered his name.
"McGreevey would be all over the legislative chamber, making friends and shaking hands," said Alan Karcher, who hired Mr. McGreevey to work in his office when he was Speaker of the Assembly in 1983. "He was ubiquitous."
Mr. McGreevey was also eager to advance, snatching up an offer to run the New Jersey Parole Board when he was 28. Two years later, in 1987, he became a lobbyist for Merck & Company, focusing on state regulatory issues for the pharmaceutical company. Mr. McGreevey says he took the job not so much to influence policy as to gain insights into corporate culture.
"Merck taught me some very valuable, lasting lessons, lessons that can be transferred to the public sector," he said in an interview. "Principled objectives. Clarity of expectations."
Encouraged by politicians he had befriended earlier in his career, Mr. McGreevey ran for the State Assembly in 1989. But when it came time for re-election, voters were angry about Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, and Mr. McGreevey, whose legislative district had been redrawn, would have faced a veteran Democrat in the primary. He relinquished his Assembly seat and ran for mayor in Woodbridge instead.
The race pitted Mr. McGreevey against Mayor Joseph DeMarino, who had helped introduce Mr. McGreevey to politics in Middlesex County and even invited him for weekends at his vacation home in the Poconos. Mr. DeMarino had been indicted on bribery charges in early 1991, and Mr. McGreevey decided to run against him in the primary. When Mr. DeMarino lost the primary, he declared himself an independent and stayed in the race. Mr. McGreevey won the general election as well. His detractors describe his challenging Mr. DeMarino, who was acquitted before Election Day, as a betrayal.
"It was a bloodbath that brought McGreevey to power," said Robert F. Gawroniak, a former Democratic councilman in Woodbridge. "He didn't have any loyalty to the people who helped him in the beginning."
Others say Mr. McGreevey was courageous to challenge a popular and powerful mayor, driven by a desire to end mismanagement and waste in Woodbridge, the fifth largest town in New Jersey. Many residents say he has succeeded, using the management skills he learned at Merck to make the town government more productive and efficient, even as he has continued seeking other offices. (Mr. McGreevey ran for the State Senate in 1993 and began planning his gubernatorial campaign in 1996.)
"I think he is a good, straightforward, honest politician," said Anthony Smith, 56, a resident of Woodbridge for 18 years. "He's a go-getter who wants to straighten things out."
 
Short Hair and Long Hours
The Dutiful Son, The Good Student
To anyone who will listen, Mr. McGreevey says he wants nothing more than to help working-class people like his own parents, Jack and Veronica McGreevey, who moved from Jersey City to a small split-level house in Carteret when their only son was 3. Growing up within earshot of the New Jersey Turnpike, Mr. McGreevey watched his father work doggedly as a traveling salesman for a trucking company. Carteret, then home to Irish, Italian and Polish families that had moved from New York and Jersey City, was full of factories, where many of the residents worked by day, and union halls, where they gathered by night.
Mr. McGreevey's parents were not involved in politics, but they made a point of knowing all their neighbors on Stima Avenue and fellow parishioners at St. Joseph's, the largest Roman Catholic church in town. They lived down the street from Thomas Deverin, the longtime Democratic Mayor of Carteret, who became one of Mr. McGreevey's political champions.
By the early 1970's, Mr. McGreevey was heading down the turnpike every day to the more affluent town of Metuchen, where he attended St. Joseph's High School. Many of the teachers at St. Joseph's then were involved in the antiwar movement. At times, Mr. McGreevey said in an interview, their message contrasted with the values he had learned from his father, whose brother, Mr. McGreevey's namesake, had died at Iwo Jima. Although the Vietnam War had ended when he left high school in 1975, Mr. McGreevey said he would have joined the Marines if his father had not insisted he attend college.
"It was like, you know, America right or wrong," Mr. McGreevey said. "Particularly regarding Vietnam."
It was not clear then that Mr. McGreevey was destined for a career in politics, Mr. Bixel and other teachers said. But he studied hard, and while many of his classmates grew their hair and dressed sloppily, he kept his dark curls short and wore ties.
"It was a tough period in terms of the confrontational behavior from students who were questioning authority," said Jerry Rabadeau, Mr. McGreevey's economics teacher at St. Joseph's. "But he didn't see the institutions as being a threat to him. He saw himself as part of the institution."
Mr. Bixel remembered Mr. McGreevey as a student who constantly challenged his teachers' positions.
"Almost on a daily basis he would say to me, 'I feel like you're bombarding us with liberal Democratic politics,' " Mr. Bixel recalled. "As a 16-year-old young man, he was certainly following the beliefs of his parents."
As the oldest child -- he has two younger sisters, Carolyn and Sharon -- Mr. McGreevey was eager to please his parents, who called him "our lad of great expectations" from the time he could walk. He learned to swim at the Rahway Y.M.C.A. when he was in fifth grade, and later became a lifeguard and took charge of the weekend swimming program. At St. Joseph's, he joined the debate team, the school spirit committee, the German Club and the yearbook staff.
Jack McGreevey said that as a teen-ager, his son rebelled not by smoking cigarettes, but by insisting that his father stop smoking 10 cigars a day.
"We worked at raising that kid," the elder Mr. McGreevey said. "He never got into pot, he never got into anything. My point is, the kid was always very good."
In 1975, Mr. McGreevey enrolled at Columbia University, where he majored in political science and spent most of his time studying in the library. Asked what he liked best about his college years, Mr. McGreevey did not reminisce about friendships kindled in smoky bars, raucous fraternity parties or pranks played on roommates. Instead, he reeled off courses: Ancient Civilization. The American Presidency. Chinese History.
"All I did in college, literally, was just work," he said during an interview in his campaign van, absently eating french fries he had just bought. "Columbia was a blur of studying. Hard work. Always focused."
He finished college in three years to save money, then enrolled at Georgetown University Law School in 1978. As a law student, he worked at the National Institute for Trial Advocacy and in the civil tax division of the Justice Department. His schedule was so busy that rather than take his white shirts to the cleaners, he waited until holidays and lugged piles of them home for his mother to wash. But Charles Lizza, a classmate, said Mr. McGreevey was not too busy to be a regular at an Irish pub frequented by politicians on Capitol Hill, where he would drink Guinness and chat with the person next to him.
"He could be as comfortable in that environment, sitting at the bar, as he was talking to a law professor," said Mr. Lizza, now a lawyer in Newark. "He is forthcoming and earnest with people of every social stature."
Mr. McGreevey went on to get a master's degree in education from Harvard University before returning to New Jersey in 1982. He worked for the Middlesex County Prosecutor before Mayor Deverin of Carteret, his neighbor, recommended him for the job in the Assembly Speaker's office. Mr. Karcher, his boss there, recalled Mr. McGreevey as a "charming Irish kid" with an obsessive interest in government. Not yet 30, he was already working 14-hour days and occasionally sleeping in the office, Mr. Karcher said.
Mr. Karcher and others who have known Mr. McGreevey for years say his refusal to slow down and take notice of the world outside politics frustrates them. John J. Fay Jr., a former state senator from Woodbridge who is one of Mr. McGreevey's closest advisers, said he only occasionally convinces Mr. McGreevey to see a movie -- the last one they saw together was "Braveheart" -- or take a day off.
Mr. Karcher, too, said he wished Mr. McGreevey would take more advantage of cultural offerings. "Jim and I are different in one important way," Mr. Karcher said. "I tried my very best never to allow politics to become my whole life. This is the only thing I find disappointing. He said his favorite radio station was CBS News Radio. I mean, Jim, please, tune into WQXR."
But the people who might be expected to fret the most about Mr. McGreevey's workaholic tendencies, his parents, have no such concern. It is easy to see why. They travel the state as volunteers for his campaign, giving speeches to veterans and residents of retirement communities and rarely getting home before 10 P.M. When a reporter asked whether his son should learn to relax, Jack McGreevey narrowed his eyes.
"A little hard work never hurt anyone, my dear lady," he said.

He rarely takes vacations, but once, in 1990, Mr. McGreevey spent a week on a cruise ship. Another passenger was Kari Schutz, a librarian from Vancouver with a soft voice and a shy smile. To hear him tell it, Mr. McGreevey was smitten. He married her a year later in a small ceremony near her home.
"I was in love with her from the moment I met her," Mr. McGreevey said, talking briefly about his wife after the second gubernatorial debate in Whippany. "She's the only woman I've ever wanted to marry."
Mr. McGreevey brought his bride home to his condominium in the Iselin section of Woodbridge, and as both were adjusting to married life, he dove into his mayoral campaign. Their daughter Morag -- her name is a Gaelic form of Mary -- was born in 1992, at the beginning of Mr. McGreevey's term. By the time she was 1, Mr. McGreevey was running for office again.
"When you're in politics as deeply as he is, you're out every night," said Mr. Gawroniak, the former Woodbridge Councilman. "I recall the girl coming into Council chambers during meetings, holding her baby. He would swoop over there and the cameras would follow. They were such an attractive couple. It seemed like she was in love."
But before long, Kari McGreevey decided she could not brook the political life. Friends of the couple say she was also homesick and worried about her mother, who was ill. She took Morag home to Vancouver in 1995 and never came back. In the divorce papers she filed that year, she accused Mr. McGreevey of being too politically ambitious to be a good husband and father.
He has said that the only significant other in his life these days is "the undecided voter."
Mr. McGreevey has been reluctant to talk about the breakup, saying only that politics played a role. Mrs. McGreevey has been even more tight-lipped, declining all requests for interviews.
But in the final weeks of the campaign, Mr. McGreevey had a change of heart. After the debate in Whippany, he dialed his wife's number on his cellular phone and asked her, coaxingly, to speak with a reporter. He supervised the three-minute conversation, whispering, "What's she saying?" and shouting, "Tell her what a good husband I am!"
Speaking softly, Mrs. McGreevey said her husband was "a good father" who was "very interested in Morag." When they lived together, she said, he cooked vegetables for dinner and scrubbed the kitchen floor. Asked which of Mr. McGreevey's qualities she most admired, Mrs. McGreevey paused.
"His honesty," she said. "He's extremely intelligent. He has a wonderful, warm personality, and he can handle so many situations so efficiently. He's able to delegate."
Asked why she abandoned the marriage, Mrs. McGreevey paused again.
"The life style," she said. "It's all-consuming. Very, very demanding. If you haven't lived it, you wouldn't even know. Jim thrives on it."
Both have denied that there was any reason other than politics for the breakup.
Mrs. McGreevey said she was especially disturbed by an incident during Mr. McGreevey's Senate campaign in 1993, when the Republican State Committee mailed out fliers with a picture of what appeared to be Mr. McGreevey's car parked in front of adult book and video shops near Times Square. "Mr. McGreevey was caught with his government-owned car enjoying himself in Manhattan," the flier read.
The Republicans later admitted the picture was a fake, but that was cold comfort to Kari McGreevey.
"I had a small child," she said. "Stressful isn't even the right word."
After allowing a few minutes of awkward conversation, Mr. McGreevey motioned that it was time to hang up. As his aides hovered, Mr. McGreevey himself reflected on the breakup.
"It was a rough life style for her," he said. "Kari was raised in a much more gentle, civil and polite environment."
Haltingly, Mr. McGreevey said he still loved his wife, calling her "a magnificent woman" who "loves me for who I am and not what position I hold." Asked if they might reconcile, he stared at the floor for several long moments.
"Time will tell," he said.
 
Political Workaholic
The Public Life Is a 24-Hour Job
To meet Mr. McGreevey is to think you know him well. He bestows nicknames on total strangers, throwing an arm around them as if he was their oldest chum. With elderly people he is a jokey Boy Scout, and with children, a sprightly coach. At a Pentecostal church in Irvington, he is "Brother McGreevey," rocking to the music and shouting, "Amen!" At a union meeting in Jersey City, he is pumping his fist and shouting, "Aaaaaaaaay!" In other settings, Italian, Spanish and Yiddish phrases roll easily off his tongue.
Yet few people have been allowed to know his innermost thoughts. In interviews and on the campaign trail, he gives summaries of his upbringing, interests and relationships, providing minimal detail. On a ride from Newark to Cherry Hill earlier this month, his answers to personal questions were predictably brief.
How did he like living in Washington during his law school years?
"Obviously, you know," Mr. McGreevey replied. "The Washington Post. Politics. It was a great opportunity."
When he calls his daughter on the phone, what do they talk about?
"School," he said. "She just won a slice of pizza because of how many books she's read."
His favorite books are political biographies and Tom Clancy novels. He runs and lifts weights at a health club in Woodbridge, listens to Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals on his tape deck and eats vegetables, soup and Italian food. Pictures of Robert F. Kennedy line his mayoral office, where the book collection includes Thomas Merton's "No Man Is an Island," Dale Carnegie's "How to Enjoy Your Life and Your Job" and Stephen Covey's "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."
By most accounts, Mayor McGreevey cleaned up a mismanaged government and brought in a more businesslike approach. He imposed fees for some services and created an economic development corporation that he said has brought 1,800 jobs to town. He also borrowed $34.6 million to stabilize finances, but has held the property tax rate to a few cents above what it was in 1990.
As a state legislator, he sponsored the Pollution Prevention Act, which has helped reduce toxic emissions, as well as a law that requires insurance companies to provide coverage for mammograms. As an assemblyman, Mr. McGreevey voted for Governor Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1991. But later, as a senator, he supported most of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's income tax cuts.
Mr. McGreevey's employees describe him as a demanding, controlling boss who is good-humored until he catches someone shirking or making mistakes. He works late into the night at City Hall in Woodbridge, responds personally to citizen complaints and sends city officials to management seminars run by Mr. Covey, whose books Mr. McGreevey devours.
"Jim doesn't tolerate inefficient thinking," said Jody Massimino, Mr. McGreevey's legislative aide. "There's no lollygagging with Jim."
Mr. Gawroniak, the former Woodbridge Councilman, said Mr. McGreevey used to display his temper when other town officials challenged him in meetings. "He just goes ballistic," Mr. Gawroniak said. "He shouts and screams and jumps up and down."
But Mr. McGreevey's friends describe a warm, funny man who likes to dance, takes them on whirlwind trips to Washington and plays hide-and-seek with their children. Ms. Massimino said Mr. McGreevey shepherded her son through the college admissions process. Mr. Kennedy, who is the Mayor of Rahway, said Mr. McGreevey paid him a surprise visit one recent night, after a long day of campaigning, because he had heard his friend was "stressed out."
"It was 11 P.M. and there was Jim, giving me advice on how to relax," Mr. Kennedy said.
Late-night calls and visits to friends are Mr. McGreevey's way of countering stress and getting feedback on his campaign, which friends say he craves. "Last night he called at midnight, wanting to know how we thought the fund-raiser went," said Mr. Kennedy's wife, Lori. "He'll always ask, 'How do you like my commercials? How do you think I'm doing?' "
Even his closest friends acknowledge that most of the time, Mr. McGreevey acts like a man possessed. But to suggest there is something unseemly about the way he conducts his life is to hold him to a different standard from other dedicated politicians, they say. Is Governor Whitman so different, they ask? Is President Clinton?
"I'm not sure there's something wrong with a man who's going to be the governor not devoting 100 percent of his talent and time to being a politician," said Mr. Deverin, Mr. McGreevey's mentor from Carteret. "You've got to give 100 percent, in heart and in mind."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: THE IMPLICATIONS;
A Yield of Little More Than 'Normalization' of Abnormal Relations

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Chinese hailed today's summit meeting as a "normalization of relations" between Washington and Beijing, but in fact it indicated how abnormal the relationship remains. Hot lines and reciprocal summitry, however useful, inevitably evoke memories of the cold war and United States-Soviet relations, which were anything but normal.
But managing United States relations with China -- arguably the most important relationship of the post-cold-war world -- will require a more subtle, less Manichean cast of mind than the cold war did. Then, most elements of American society were on the same page. Now they are not, with business pushing for freer trade, trade unionists complaining about unfair competition from cheap goods, and members of Congress and churchmen stressing human rights. 
 And all the while, more Americans, perhaps needing one, are coming to regard China as an adversary, if not in political at least in economic terms. In a new Gallup poll taken for CNN and USA Today, 36 percent said they regarded China as unfriendly or an outright enemy. In 1983, before Tiananmen Square, the figure was 21 percent.
In a news conference with President Jiang Zemin of China this afternoon, an event that lasted more than an hour, President Clinton never once described anything that had happened during the Chinese leader's visit to the United States this week as "historic."
For the usually ebullient Mr. Clinton, who often points with pride to landmarks and milestones and political breakthroughs, it was a telling omission that epitomized the difficulty of relations between Beijing and Washington. If he seemed muted, an American official said, it was because the negotiations before and during this summit conference, the first of its type in a decade, have been marked by "ask-no-quarter, give-no-quarter bargaining."
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that "after days and days and days, we have found it difficult to have even the most basic kinds of discussions with China," except for an important agreement on the first export to China of advanced American nuclear technology.
On the crucial question of human rights, the two leaders might as well have been on different planets. Top American negotiators had tried to convince Mr. Jiang at least to express remorse for the deaths of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, even if he was unwilling to say the decision to open fire was wrong.
When Mr. Jiang did not do so, and instead said at the news conference that the Chinese Government had "drawn the correct conclusion" and moved swiftly to insure stability, and when he said blandly that "it is just natural for our two countries to hold different views on some issues," Mr. Clinton had no choice, his aides said, but to respond bluntly. He did so, asserting that the shootings and "the continuing reluctance to tolerate political dissent" had kept China from developing a significant level of support in the world.
It was a stark admission of failure, unusual in summit annals.
The plain fact is that in Chinese-American relations many of the most important questions are not susceptible of solution by top political leaders, or they are susceptible of solution only by running greater risks than the politicians are willing to accept. Most of the progress that has been made, and it is limited, has been made by businessmen and only ratified later by governments, like the big deal under which Boeing will sell 50 jetliners to China.
"In many senses," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told American executives in Beijing last month, "you have invested in this relationship more fully than we have in Washington." And today Mr. Clinton gave a certain primacy to economics when he was asked why the United States did not try to broker an agreement between China and Taiwan, as it had sought to do in Bosnia and the Middle East.
"Since so much investment and contact has gone on in the last few years between Taiwan and China, I think the Chinese people know how to resolve this when the time is right," he said, taking the ball from the hands of the diplomats and putting it squarely in the hands of business.
Except in Washington, where such events always matter more than they do in the country at large, the spotlight has been stolen from the summit conference by the gyrations of Wall Street, gyrations that had their origin in Southeast Asia and in China's new special administrative zone, Hong Kong.
Only 15 years ago, Americans and their Government felt powerless to stop the march of the Asian economies, and they feared the loss of jobs and control of American financial markets. Now they feel powerless to halt the rot in the Asian economies, and they still fear the loss of jobs and control of American financial markets.
When cracks began to appear in the "tiger economies" of Southeast Asia some months ago, the Administration decided not to attempt any bailout of the type used successfully during the Mexican crisis of 1994-95. Mr. Rubin has said repeatedly that the United States must not allow itself to be seen as the world's banker of last resort, ready to step into every financial crisis everywhere. To do so, he has contended, would spawn more crises.
Even after Monday's plunge in stock prices on Wall Street, there was more talk than action in Washington. That brought criticism from some experts on the region, including a former ambassador, a Democrat, who described the failure to intervene as "a craven and ultimately damaging approach."
Ultimately, government has to try in some areas, no matter what the problems, because there are a number of things that business cannot or will not do. Human rights are one subject to which business executives are averse. Nor can they negotiate trade agreements, so the Clinton Administration has put a huge effort into finding some way to to integrate China into the world economy and into making it possible for Beijing to join the World Trade Organization.
But no headway at all was reported after this summit meeting on that difficult subject, either.
The best the two leaders and their associates could do was concentrate on process, agreeing to meet regularly and to set up a communications link. Mr. Clinton agreed to visit China next spring. Mr. Rubin and Zhu Rongji, China's economic czar, agreed to talk about instability in financial markets.
There was also talk of "a constructive strategic partnership," but precious little flesh was put onto those bare rhetorical bones, beyond some generalized talk about dealing with continued instability on the Korean peninsula and some significant progress in coping with the touchy problem of nuclear proliferation.

HEADLINE: Papers Link Donations to 2 On Senate Hearings Panel

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Documents released by Senate investigators today identified 20 donors to a private conservative organization that worked outside the normal political channels in ways that benefited conservative Republicans, including two members of the Senate committee investigating campaign finances.
One beneficiary was Senator Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican who as a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee has been trying to persuade the Senate leadership to end the hearings that have proceeded for almost four months under the direction of Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee. 
 Another committee member who benefited from the organization's activities was Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas.
Senator Nickles appeared in marketing advertisements for the organization, Triad Management Services, a consulting group that helped conservative donors make contributions outside the purview of Federal election laws. Mr. Nickles's political action committee received tens of thousands of dollars in donations in 1996 from some of Triad's biggest donors.
In Mr. Brownback's 1996 Senate race, a last-minute $400,000 television advertising blitz was paid for by Triad donors. These advertisements appeared in the closing weeks of the election and attacked his Democratic opponent as an out-of-state liberal.
Besides raising money from conservative donors and funneling it to Republican candidates, Triad also raised money for two affiliated nonprofit groups that ran advertisements attacking Democratic candidates. Such groups have been criticized as thinly disguised fronts for partisan political activities, purporting to be issue oriented but often supporting individual candidates and their campaigns.
Triad has been highlighted repeatedly by advocates of campaign finance reform as an example of how loopholes in the law allow donors and candidates to exceed limits on donations and avoid having their names linked directly with specific candidates. Federal campaign law prohibits individuals from giving more than $2,000 in a campaign cycle. There is no such limit on donations to nonprofit groups like Triad.
Hearings had been scheduled for this week before the Governmental Affairs Committee into Triad's campaign activities, but Republicans on the committee canceled them after Democratic members of the committee obtained names earlier this week of Triad's donors.
The documents being circulated today also indicate that Mr. Brownback benefited beyond the advantage he received from the attack advertisements. His father- and mother-in-law, John and Ruth Stauffer, were able to donate more than $32,500 to him through several conservative political action committees that worked closely with Triad and steered the Stauffers' donations back to Mr. Brownback's campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.
A spokesman for Mr. Nickles denied today that the Senator's desire to end the hearings was tied to his relationship with Triad.
"Senator Nickles has all along thought the hearings should not be a mile wide and an inch deep," said Brook Simmons, Mr. Nickles's spokesman. "With regard to Triad, this is just a desperate attempt by the Democratic National Committee to draw attention away from their own serious misdeeds."
The documents, obtained from Congressional investigators, show that the biggest Triad donor is the Cone family of Pennsylvania, which runs a company that manufacturers children's clothes. Robert Cone and his brother Edward, according to bank documents, donated around $1.1 million to Triad and two affiliated nonprofit groups that sponsored the attack advertisements for the Brownback campaign.
The family, which declined comment, also gave $10,500 to Mr. Nickles's political action committee, the Republican Majority Fund.
Another donor being examined by the committee is Koch Industries, an oil company in Wichita, Kan., and the nation's second-largest privately held company. The documents show that it gave $2,000 directly to Triad. But Senate investigators say they believe Koch Industries supports the Economic Education Trust, based in Twin Falls, Idaho, which gave $1.3 million to Triad in 1996.
Jay Rosser, a spokesman for Koch Industries, declined to comment on any relationship with Triad or the trust.
Mr. Nickles has received large campaign contributions from Koch Industries over the years. In 1989, Mr. Nickles defended the company in Congress against allegations that the oil refiner had been illegally taking oil from the Osage Indian reservation and from Federal property. A grand jury investigation cleared the company, although a Senate study concluded that Koch Industries had short-changed the tribe.
Other big Triad donors include Foster Friess, a Jackson, Wyo., money manager, who donated $25,000. Mr. Friess is a major Republican donor who gave $260,000 to two campaign committees headed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York.
Bruce Benson, the 1994 Republican candidate for Colorado governor, gave Triad $25,000. Mr. Benson said he believed the donation was for a good cause.
"These candidates needed our support and I trust the money went to do a good job," he said.

Federal Forms to Include New Racial Categories
The Clinton Administration adopted new categories for people to list their racial and ethnic makeup on Federal forms, allowing people for the first time to identify themselves as members of more than one race. The change means that people can identify themselves as white, black, Asian or American Indian or whatever combination of races applies. The Administration rejected the establishment of a new "multiracial" classification that would have covered all people of mixed racial heritage. A1
 
DDT Not Tied to Breast Cancer
A large study has found no evidence that exposure to the chemicals DDT and PCB's increases the risk of breast cancer. Patient advocates have long been concerned that certain chemicals, notably the pesticide DDT, which was banned in 1972, and the industrial chemicals known as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, banned in 1977, might have contributed to the slow rise in the incidence of breast cancer in this country.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: THE OVERVIEW;
U.S. and China Reach Trade Pacts but Clash on Rights

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
President Clinton and the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, engaged in a day of unexpectedly contentious talks today that produced several significant commercial agreements but appeared to broaden the gulf between the two powers on human rights.
China agreed to buy $3 billion worth of American civilian airplanes and to make concessions that clear the way for Americans to compete to sell nuclear reactors to China. 
 The concession, announced by President Clinton, was that China would abandon its nuclear cooperation program with Iran, which United States officials suspect was a cover for the development of nuclear weapons. China's assurances will permit American companies to bid on commercial nuclear power contracts in China that are potentially worth $60 billion.
The agreements came after Mr. Jiang, leading an aggressive Chinese delegation that refused to follow the script written for the summit meeting, tried but failed to win concessions on trade from the American side. Even though he did not get all he wanted, Mr. Jiang will leave Washington on Thursday with his stature as a global leader enhanced.
But when he goes to New York on Thursday, Mr. Jiang can expect a chilly reception instead of the warm official handshakes that have greeted him on the first three stops. Neither Governor George E. Pataki nor Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to greet him on his arrival or to attend a dinner reception for him Friday at the Waldorf-Astoria. Page B1.
American officials hailed the business accords as the product of a successful policy of "constructive engagement" with Beijing.
But if the summit meeting was good for commerce, it did little to assuage American concerns about political and religious rights in China. Mr. Jiang stood beside Mr. Clinton at a joint news conference this afternoon and forcefully defended China's preference for order over personal freedom, even when the result is the abridgement of individual rights.
The Chinese President emphasized the mutual economic benefits of the relationship between the two countries and tried to minimize the "noises" he heard from rights protesters gathered in Lafayette Park, across from the White House.
"President Clinton and I share the view that China and the United States enjoy a high degree of complementarity and a huge potential for cooperation in the economic and trade fields," he said.
But Mr. Clinton insisted that the China could not expect to prosper while suppressing freedom. He said the United States and China had "profound disagreements" on Beijing's treatment of its citizens even as it sought to broaden the two countries' business ties.
"The American people greatly admire China's extraordinary economic transformation, and we understand the importance that your own experiences and your present challenges lead you to place upon maintaining stability," he said. "But we also believe that China will enjoy more growth and more stability as it embraces more fully the political as well as the economic aspirations of all your people."
Later, at a state dinner at the White House, the two Presidents kept their respective tones as they exchanged toasts. Acknowledging Mr. Jiang's interest in American history, President Clinton said: "Long before the United States was even born, China was a stronghold of creativity, knowledge and wealth." Many of China's earliest contributions, Mr. Clinton went on, "still enrich our lives today."
Mr. Jiang said, "Differences that cannot be resolved for the time being can be put aside while concentrating on seeking common ground." The countries' joint interests in peace, security and prosperity outweigh their differences, he said.
At the earlier press conference, Mr. Clinton offered an unusual defense of freedom of speech in the United States. "In our country I think it would amaze many of our Chinese guests to see some of the things that have been written and said about me -- my family -- our Government, our policies. And yet after all this time I'm still standing here, and our country is stronger than it was before those words were uttered six years ago."
Then Mr. Clinton turned and amended his statement: "Excuse me. Before those words began to be said six years ago. They're still being said every day."
Mr. Jiang, clearly relishing the international spotlight that the Washington summit meeting brought him, told a global television audience that a country of 1.2 billion could not progress toward economic reform and renewal without "social and political stability."
"The concepts on democracy, on human rights and on freedoms are relative and specific ones, and they are to be determined by the specific national situation of different countries," Mr. Jiang said.
He offered no apologies for the brutal suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989 or for his country's continued jailing of dissidents today. And he warned Mr. Clinton against interfering in China's internal affairs.
Mr. Clinton, responding to Mr. Jiang in a moment of drama that defined the distance between the United States and China on the fundamental question of human rights, declared the Chinese Government to be "on the wrong side of history" in its response to the Tiananmen demonstrations and in its approach to personal liberties.
"I believe that what happened and the aftermath and the continuing reluctance to tolerate political dissent has kept China from politically developing the level of support in the rest of the world that otherwise would have been developed," Mr. Clinton said.
The exchange encapsulated a two-day meeting designed to move Washington and Beijing toward warmer relations and more regular contacts. But three-and-a-half hours of face-to-face talks between the two leaders did not appear to bring the two significantly closer.
At other times during the news conference, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang appeared to be talking past each other, addressing skeptical domestic constituencies rather than each other.
Mr. Jiang was asked if he would release two prominent political prisoners, Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng. Mr. Jiang replied peremptorily, "I am the president of the People's Republic of China, not the chief judge of the Supreme Court of China."
Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser, called the news conference at the conclusion of the two leaders' meetings "an extraordinary event" that could never have occurred in China.
"I don't suspect that President Jiang has ever been subjected to a press conference like that," Mr. Berger said. "I think that's good and I think that's healthy."
Senior American officials said that the Chinese negotiated very aggressively over the last three days. Officials who attended the meetings said that while the Chinese were tough and at times intransigent, the summit talks brought a new level of candor to the relationship that had not been present in four previous meetings between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang.
"There has been an evolution from their first, highly scripted meeting in Seattle in 1993," this official said. "Jiang is much more willing to leave his talking points to speak clearly and directly. There was a forthrightness about these discussion that allows us to do problem-solving at these meetings, rather than just reading notes at each other."
Although the leaders were not asked about allegations now being investigated in Congress that China funneled illegal campaign contributions into last year's election, Mr. Clinton did raise the issue in private, Mr. Berger said. He said that Mr. Jiang had repeated what he has said on the subject several times before, that China had not engaged in illegal activity but that he would cooperate with American investigators.
Despite the frost at the summit talks, there were propitious winds on trade and business development, although they come at a price of tolerating China's present tariff structure and its human rights record.
Mr. Clinton said he would lift a 12-year ban the sale of American nuclear technology to China, an action long sought by American corporations avidly eyeing the estimated $60 billion Chinese market for civilian nuclear power plants. The move, which has fostered protests in Congress, requires Mr. Clinton to certify that China has ceased supplying technology that could be used for nuclear weapons development to Iran and other countries.
Officials said that China has provided written assurances that it will engage in no further nuclear cooperation with Iran, and will end two existing contracts. The Administration said it will make the classified agreement with China available to members of Congress.
Mr. Clinton, anticipating criticism on the nuclear deal, called the agreement a "win-win-win" for the United States. "It serves America's national security, environmental and economic interests," he said.
Mr. Jiang announced that China would accede to the Information Technology Agreement signed last winter, which will eliminate China's steep tariffs on imported computer and telecommunications equipment.
The leaders also announced a contract for the sale to China of 50 Boeing jetliners worth $3 billion.
But Mr. Clinton rejected one Chinese request -- that the United States make a firm commitment to helping China join the World Trade Organization by the end of 1998. Chinese officials pointed out that the United States made a similar agreement with Russia for its entry into the trade organziation. Mr. Clinton said he would do "everything possible" to bring China into the organization, but he would not ask the organization to bend its rules on tariffs and trade barriers to ease China's entry.
The summit meeting produced a number of lesser accords, including a commitment to high-level visits on economic, security, environmental and law-enforcement issues. The United States will open an office of the Drug Enforcement Agency in Beijing and send lawyers and jurists to China to consult on development of civil and criminal justice systems.
Mr. Clinton announced that he would visit China in the second half of next year, the first American President to do so since President George Bush's trip in 1989 before the Tiananmen Square bloodbath.
China and the United States -- the world's two largest producers of greenhouse gases -- agreed to cooperate on finding a workable solution to the problem of global warming. American companies will be given access to Chinese markets to build cleaner power plants, more efficient cars and rural power stations.
The Administration's hope had been that the summit talks would be marked by significant advances in the economic arena, where the United States and China have historically made the greatest progress. But today's results, officials conceded, were disappointing.
"The general tone was intransigence," one senior Administration official said. "Friendly, cooperative-sounding intransigence."
There were some areas the two sides could boast about. The order for Boeing was significantly larger than most officials here anticipated: 50 planes for $3 billion instead of 30 planes for $2 billion. And China abandoned its opposition to joining the Information Technology Agreement, which reduces tariffs on computer and other information-technology products to zero within the next seven years. That affects about $1.8 billion in American exports to China, and is a fast-growing sector of trade.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang twice touched on the financial turmoil in Asia, and Mr. Jiang went to some lengths to argue that the underlying condition of Hong Kong is solid. At Mr. Clinton's suggestion, the two men agreed that Mr. Rubin and Zhu Rongji, China's chief economic official, should work together to "promote financial stability in Asia." But Treasury officials said that there was not yet a concrete plan for accomplishing that goal.

HEADLINE: For China's Visiting President, Forecast in New York Is Chilly

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
Instead of the 21-gun salutes and warm official handshakes that have greeted him so far on his state visit, President Jiang Zemin of China can expect a chilly reception in New York this evening. Neither Governor George E. Pataki nor Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to greet him on his arrival or to attend a reception for him at the Waldorf-Astoria tomorrow evening.
And to the dismay of some local Chinese leaders, Mr. Jiang is offering what some see as a slight of his own: he plans to avoid any visits to the Chinese communities in the city, among the largest Chinese outposts in the country. Although the Chinese have established other communities on the West Coast, Chinatown, in lower Manhattan, is still considered by many to be the political and economic center for new immigrants. 
 The situation reflects the sensitive political geography of New York's diverse Chinese community. While the old, predominantly Cantonese power structure of Chinatown has been overwhelmingly pro-Taiwan, a flood of newcomers from Fujian province in southern China has profoundly altered both the balance of power and the sentiment toward the mainland. While many of the Fujianese ask for political asylum on arrival, they nonetheless remain loyal to China and champion Chinese causes.
Although business interest is the primary reason for Mr. Jiang's visit, human rights seem to be at the core of both scheduling issues. Aides to the Governor and the Mayor say they wish to avoid any appearance that they condone China's imprisonment of political dissidents. And even a warm welcome for the Chinese leader in Chinatown would give human rights protesters another opportunity to embarrass him. Protests have been staged in Washington and human rights activists have vowed to follow him in New York and in Boston.
For weeks, Mr. Jiang's visit has dominated conversation and news coverage in the Chinese-language media. For some Fujianese leaders, Mr. Jiang's decision to avoid Chinatown has undermined their decadelong struggle to win recognition and acceptance from the city's power structure, which has traditionally allied itself with Taiwan and the old guard of Chinatown.
At the same time, even those who are disappointed are reluctant to criticize Mr. Jiang openly and speak with pride about China's economic accomplishments.
"We understand he has to meet with big businesses during his short stay and he doesn't want to face the demonstrators," said a Fujianese community leader who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But it would have meant so much to us if he could just squeeze Chinatown in."
During his two-night stay, Mr. Jiang is scheduled to tour the New York Stock Exchange and offices of IBM, AT&T and Lucent Technologies; at the Waldorf, he will dine with top executives of major American corporations. He also plans to meet with representatives from the city's Chinese community, either at the Chinese Consulate or at his hotel.
There are no rules governing the itineraries of visiting international figures. Some, like Sandro Pertini, the late former President of Italy, seek out those with a common heritage. When Mr. Pertini visited New York in 1982, he visited Staten Island, where there is a large Italian-American population.
Nelson Mandela of South Africa met with African-Americans in Harlem in 1990; Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti met with Haitian students at Brooklyn College in 1992.
But Mr. Jiang is steering clear of Chinatown, Flushing, Queens, and Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
For Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani, the decision not to meet with Mr. Jiang is the most expedient solution to a delicate situation.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for the Governor, cited "scheduling conflicts" and "the upcoming election" as reasons for his absence. Mr. Pataki will be campaigning for Republican candidates across the state, she said. Besides, she added, the distance between Albany and New York would make a meeting difficult. "The Governor is in upstate New York," Ms. Mucha said.
 But privately, an aide to the Governor conceded that he was boycotting the events to protest China's persistent human rights abuses.
"Clearly the Governor has concerns on that issue, as do millions of Americans," said the aide, who insisted on anonymity.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, Colleen Roche, said the Mayor was boycotting the event because of "grave concerns about China's human rights policies." In addition, she said, he will be busy with his campaign for re-election.
The two United States Senators from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato, have also said they would not attend the events. To some political observers, the official snub says as much about Mr. Pataki's and Mr. Giuliani's lack of diplomacy as about China's human rights problems.
"It's a sign of remarkable rudeness," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Taub Urban Research Center, "to ignore the leader of a nation of 1.2 billion people.
"But there is no outer limit to the rudeness that can be exhibited in New York," he said.
Indeed, some say that snubbing Mr. Jiang is the wrong approach to resolving human rights problems in China. Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant, said the Governor and the Mayor were missing an opportunity to confront Mr. Jiang.
"To the extent New York is displeased with China's human rights policy, it is an opportunity to send China a message," said Mr. Morris, who is a consultant for Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn. But others say the Governor and the Mayor are doing the right thing.
"I'm not happy with the human rights violations," Mr. D'Amato said. "For us to look the other way is wrong."
This is not the first time Mr. Jiang has been slighted on his visit. On Tuesday, Gov. George F. Allen of Virginia backed out of an event, leaving his wife to read a letter with veiled criticisms of China's human rights record.
But Mr. Jiang is expected to be greeted by top state and city officials elsewhere. In Hawaii, he was greeted by Gov. Benjamin Cayetano, and he is expected to meet with the Mayors of Boston and Los Angeles and the Governors of Massachusetts and California.
Whatever the consequences of Mr. Jiang's itinerary for business ties between New York and China, his failure to tour Chinatown may leave some bruised feelings among the Fujianese, who have organized parades to celebrate the national day of China and the return of Hong Kong.
"This is like a slap on the face for them," said Robin Mui, the production manager of Sing Tao Daily, a Chinese-language newspaper that is neutral with regard to China and Taiwan.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return phone calls seeking comment. The Chinese Consulate in New York hung up on a reporter in mid-sentence.
On the streets of Chinese communities throughout the city, many were critical over the official snub to Mr. Jiang. "China is changing," said Tsu Chun Kuo, a businessman in Flushing, Queens. "And it would be a shame for the United States not to be a part of this change."
But many in Chinatown say they are thrilled that he came to the city. A garment worker from Hong Kong, Zhu Ping, said she had not expected Mr. Jiang to visit Chinatown. "He is such an important person and we are so unimportant. I'm not offended at all that he should spend his time on more important issues."
She added: "Just to see his picture in the newspaper is good enough for me. I'm from Hong Kong, and now I'm Chinese. And I'm so proud to be a Chinese."
In other circles, the question of what to feed Mr. Jiang is as delicate as some political issues.
During a state visit by Deng Xiaoping in 1979, official hosts tried to avoid serving the Chinese delegation large portions of beef, believing it might offend their sensibilities, or chicken, which they feared would seem too inexpensive. As a result, meal after meal, Mr. Deng was served veal.
But one of the hosts of tomorrow evening's banquet, the U.S.-China Business Council, a trade organization representing U.S. companies doing businesses with China, says it has found a solution. While the council would not reveal the exact menu, its president, Robert A. Kapp, said the entree would be something that has the "prestige of a four-legged animal without the unappealing quality of red meat." Like chicken, but more upscale.

HEADLINE: People Can Claim One or More Races On Federal Forms

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today adopted new rules for listing racial and ethnic makeup on Federal forms, allowing people for the first time to identify themselves as members of more than one race.
The change, which could affect Government policies like affirmative action and the drawing of legislative districts, is the first revision in the Government's definition of racial and ethnic groupings since 1977. It means that on Federal forms people can identify themselves in a single racial category or a combination. 
 The Administration rejected a "multiracial" classification that would have covered all people of mixed racial heritage.
"We're allowing people to express that multiracial heritage in whatever way they view themselves," said Franklin D. Raines, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, which issued the rules. "A multiracial category would simply say there is some combination that people believe they are but wouldn't tell you much more than that."
Three categories will remain the same: black, white and American Indian or Alaska Native. In addition, the category of Asian or Pacific Islander will be split into a classification for Asians and one for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. The black category will be known as black or African-American. The ethnic category of Hispanic will remain, known as Hispanic or Latino.
The first major official use of the new rules is to be in next year's dress rehearsal of the 2000 census. They will take effect on Thursday and were chosen after more than four years of study, debate and testing. They also reflect the growing segment of the nation's population that is of mixed racial parentage.
"It will have profound impact in places like California, which has a high percentage of people with mixed racial backgrounds, not just black and white," said Carlos Fernandez, who founded of the Association of Multiethnic Americans, a lobbying group. "I believe one of the reasons that the pressure built up and O.M.B. reacted was that they saw the numbers growing and the future trends."
But the Administration has yet to say how people who select this option will be counted in studies like the census. The Administration has not decided how to count someone who lists a racial makeup of black and white. More complicated is what to do with people listing themselves as black, white and Asian. Should such a person be counted as black, white or Asian or some combination?
The counting issue is important because Federal policy under measures like the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and aid for bilingual education is based on the percentage of certain racial groups in a given location. For example, legislative districts must be drawn in such a manner to insure that black residents are adequately represented, and block-by-block census counts are essential to the process.
The issues over how to list people of mixed race are a microcosm of the intricate racial issues confronting the nation as it moves into the next century. They are the outgrowth of group-identity politics that first emerged along racial lines with the black nationalist movement in the 1960's, and then infused other ethnic and racial groups, including the demands now by children of mixed-race marriages to be recognized in their own right.
The number of children in mixed-race families increased to 2 million in 1990 from 500,000 in 1970. The number of people who consider themselves of more than one race is still small. About 1 percent of people, mainly Asians and American Indians, listed themselves as being of more than one race in a 1996 test conducted by the Census Bureau. But the number appears to be growing, and the popularity of celebrities of mixed-race heritage like the golfer Tiger Woods could lead more people to identify themselves with more than one race.
For the most part, demographers, academics and groups representing multiracial people would prefer dividing people into as many subgroups as possible to better study economic, cultural and social trends. Civil rights groups, on the other hand, fear that the dilution of the number of people identified with a single group if the identification is spread over too many categories.
For example, lawyers in employment discrimination suits will at times try to prove that a company is racially biased by comparing the number of blacks in particular jobs with the proportion of African-Americans in the local population. Such litigation could be greatly affected if a significant number of blacks list themselves as being of more than one race, and the Government counts them as something other than black.
Officials at the Office of Management and Budget said they would meet with officials from other Federal agencies, interest groups, demographers, planners and social scientists to work out a policy for counting people who list themselves as members of more than one race. The officials said they hoped to put out recommendations on the issue by the fall of 1998.
The fight over how to count people will be arduous. The Association of Multiethnic Americans will argue that mixed-race residents be counted separately, Mr. Fernandez said.
Such a view is bound to raise concerns among some minority critics who have contended all along that the drive for a changing the racial categories was a way to attack affirmative action and other race-based government programs.
"I believe the same people who are against affirmative action are the same people who are pushing this," said Robert Hill, the director of the Institute of Urban Research at Morgan State University in Baltimore.
Mr. Hill is also the chairman of a Census 2000 Advisory Committee on the African-American Population.
The Administration's review of the official racial classifications began after lobbying by groups representing mixed-race people. In the debate over new categories since 1993, a myriad of groups has sought to gain official acceptance, many in the mistaken belief that recognition would lead to Federal financial aid.
A drive for a new category of Arab-American or Middle Eastern American foundered because groups from that volatile part of the world could not agree on whether such a classification would include both Arab-Americans and Jewish immigrants from Israel.

HEADLINE: Lesson for Thailand's Small Investors: What Goes Up . . .

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Oct. 29

 BODY:
"I'm afraid," the young investor said, staring at her brightly colored computer monitor on a small stock-trading floor. "I dare not buy. I'm afraid it will go down more tomorrow."
She was hesitating, like so many investors here and abroad this week, as stock markets around the world heaved and quaked in the latest reaction to an Asian economic crisis that began this summer here in Thailand. 
The investor, who would allow only her given name, Sukanya, to be used, has reason to be afraid. Like many Thai entrepreneurs, she entered the stock market during its recent boom years and now has lost big.
"My boyfriend told me I could use his money to buy anything, any stock," she said on Monday. "I started with 45 million baht" -- more than $1 million -- "three years ago. Now it's worth 4 million. That's why I drive this old car."
At a nearby monitor, Chansin Vongreeramit, a retired finance company executive, was bolder. While Sukanya waited for her chosen stock, Siam City Bank, to drop another tenth of a point, Mr. Chansin bought.
Half an hour later, the stock inched upward. He had earned $103. That modest amount made him the day's big winner here at the headquarters of the Thai Farmers Bank.
Burdened by the country's economic problems, the Stock Exchange of Thailand seemed impervious today to a rebound in New York and around Asia, with its index falling eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Instead of a central trading floor, small outlets like this one around Bangkok handle individual trades. Most people here, like Sukanya, did not play at all on Monday. They chatted over coffee and crullers, read newspapers and dozed in their seats as the room's big trading board flashed its depressing numbers.
Since the baht's effective devaluation in July, its value has tumbled more than 40 percent. The stock market, already weakening over recent months, tumbled too, falling from about 1,200 points when Sukanya began investing her boyfriend's money to well under 500 now.
The trading floors began to empty out. Some investors lingered only to sell off their remaining holdings.
"I realize it's better to quit," said a man who declined to give his name. "You know why? I cannot afford to lose any longer. Nobody gains. Nobody gains, believe me."
It is a feeling that is shared by many people in Thailand today who are looking back across the last decade of heady growth with sudden astonishment as if waking from a happy dream.
"It was so exciting," Sukanya said.
Thailand was the darling of foreign investors, and until market forces and currency exchange rates turned against the country, huge amounts of money rolled in.
Now the squeeze is on. The International Monetary Fund has promised a $17 billion credit line in return for fiscal austerity programs. Prices are rising, companies are closing and hundreds of thousands of people are beginning to lose their jobs.
Fifty-eight finance companies that overextended themselves in loans, particularly for property, have been forced to close.
One of these is the General Finance and Securities Company, where Sukanya used to do her trading. Now its trading floor is dark and padlocked, with only a special lounge for regular investors remaining open.
Only a handful of people sat quietly there on Monday in the glow of their computer screens. One of them was asleep.

Study Faults Connecticut

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
High taxes and high insurance costs are making Connecticut a hard place for manufacturers to do business, according to a new study.
The Manufacturing Alliance of Connecticut, a trade group, ranked the state 43d out of 50 based on 13 business categories, including taxes and the productivity of workers. 
 Connecticut was found to have an advantage in research and development spending, education spending and availability of loans.
Rhode Island and New Hampshire were other New England states in the bottom 10, the study found. It ranked Massachusetts 27th, and found Washington State to be friendliest to manufacturing.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CANDIDATES;
Giuliani Shrugs Off Messinger's Attacks in Debate

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger used her final joint television appearance with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani last night to repeatedly bludgeon his first-term record, blaming him for a "crisis" in city schools and for high unemployment that she warned signaled dark times ahead.
For 60 minutes, Ms. Messinger, the Democratic mayoral candidate, took the offensive whenever she could in what was likely to be her last prolonged exposure to the public before Tuesday's vote. Mr. Giuliani responded with the occasional protest and jibe, asserting that the city's fortunes had vastly improved under his stewardship, and pledging to focus in a second term on areas Ms. Messinger singled out as lacking: schools and job creation. 
 But for the most part, the Republican Mayor shrugged off Ms. Messinger's attacks. He smiled, laughed dismissively as she crisply laid out her arguments and even -- to the evident surprise of Ms. Messinger and the small audience in the television studio -- complimented her as qualified to fill the position of Mayor. In sum, Mr. Giuliani acted like a candidate who, as several friends said yesterday, considers his victory a virtual certainty, and thus saw no reason to take many risks last night.
"Let me point out that we're certainly seeing the nice Rudy Giuliani tonight," Ms. Messinger said with a grin as their hourlong debate, broadcast on WABC, came to an end.
The debate, the candidates' second, was short on drama and suspense, with both Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Messinger repeating, for the most part, arguments that have become familiar to both of them. But while polls suggest that many voters think a Giuliani victory is all but assured, Ms. Messinger was as scrappy and combative as she has been at any point in this campaign. In her closing statement, when the moderator tried to cut her off, Ms. Messinger pushed on, saying she represented a view of New York City vastly different from Mr. Giuliani's. The Mayor, she said, "never talks about the poor at all," as she tried to emphasize their different political philosophies:
"Seeing that no child goes to bed hungry or homeless. Giving working families a fair shake. These issues are at the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. They've never been high on Rudy's list. And why they should they be? I'm a Democrat, he's a Republican. Fashionable or not, I've cared about these problems all my life."
Mr. Giuliani offered a far different view of the city. "I don't see a city in which all problems have been solved," he said, "and I don't see a city in which everyone has been included in the opportunity and access that many have had. But I do see a city that's made improvements. I see a city that's better off than it was four years ago. Crime is down dramatically. Jobs are coming back."
Viewers of last night's debate were afforded a fairly broad picture of the candidates' stylistic and ideological differences and similarities. Both candidates said they would accept, to a limited degree, the presence of police in schools to combat violence, and experimenting with year-round schools.
Ms. Messinger said she would push for legislation or contract provisions requiring police officers hired in the future to live in the city. Mr. Giuliani said he opposed that. Ms. Messinger said that the city should not build a stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan, even if the team threatens to move out of the state, without submitting the issue to voters for approval. Mr. Giuliani called such an initiative illegal.
And Mr. Giuliani said he did not consider school overcrowding as great a problem as Ms. Messinger did. He said he had attended schools with as many as 50 students in a class and asserted, in response to a question, that he would rather have his son Andrew attend a class that large, if it was safe and effective, than a small class that was not.
The two candidates took different tacks, as well, when asked whether they would pledge to serve out their terms. The question was addressed to both candidates, but reflected the fact that Mr. Giuliani's aides are pushing for a large margin of victory in the belief that it would position him to run for higher office.
Mr. Giuliani refused to say whether he would serve out his term. "I have no idea what the future is going to bring," he said. "It would be my intention to serve out four years, if my health remains, if everything remains O.K., but I can't rule out options in the future."
There has been no speculation that Ms. Messinger, if she wins, might turn around and seek another, higher office. She did nothing to encourage such discussion last night. She described Mr. Giuliani's position as "a real dodge," adding: "I promise you that I will serve as your Mayor every single minute of the next four years. I will not be out measuring the curtains in my next office."
The debate also produced a novel political exchange that seemed to capture the changing political calculus in New York: Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, attacked Ms. Messinger, a product of the city's liberal wing, for promising not to raise taxes if she is elected Mayor.
"How is it possible to make that pledge responsibly?" he asked. "You have no idea, I have no idea -- you saw what happened on Wall Street just a few days ago -- what kind of situation the city would be in a year from now."
Mr. Giuliani added, "Do you want to withdraw that pledge because it really isn't a responsible way to go into this campaign?"
Ms. Messinger said that she did not. "I believe it's extremely responsible and shows my respect for the heavy burdens on the taxpayers of this city to say that over the next four years I would not raise taxes."
Despite these exchanges, this debate did not approach the sometimes sharp tone of the one in September. When a questioner asked whether Ms. Messinger was qualified to be Mayor, Mr. Giuliani nodded yes.
"I don't agree with her ideas and I think she would take the city back to where it was four or five years ago, but I don't quarrel with her qualifications," he said. "She has had a distinguished career in public service."
Ms. Messinger quickly protested: "Let me be as clear as I can. It is my intention to move this city forward. Although there is nothing the matter, Mr. Mayor, with a city, in which the Mayor fought --"
Mr. Giuliani cut her off: "That was a compliment, Ruth." The audience laughed.
"Oh no, " Ms. Messinger said. "It's only a compliment if you think backwards is a good direction."
"We disagree on ideas," the Mayor said. "I think you have a long and distinguished public career."
"I thank you," Ms. Messinger said.

HEADLINE: At Home With;
A Hardy Perennial, Her Passions Still Blooming

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL

 BODY:
WHEN Henry Kravis and Carolyne Roehm separated in 1993, her mother said, "Now you'll know who your friends are."
Ms. Roehm winces at the memory. "At the time, I asked, 'Do I want to know that much?' " 
 Sitting in the living room of her Sutton Place apartment last week, Ms. Roehm said, "There are people I never heard from again, but the people who have remained my friends are wonderful."
A group of them declared themselves last week by throwing a publication party at the Union League Club for Ms. Roehm's first book, "A Passion for Flowers" (HarperCollins, $45). The list read like a gossip column from the glory days of the 1980's, featuring Gayfryd Steinberg, Anne Bass and Blaine Trump.
But the appearance of one guest in particular moved Ms. Roehm: Kimberly Kravis, her former stepdaughter. "I hadn't seen her or Robbie, her brother, much," she said, "because I think you should let the dust settle with everything in life. They're great kids."
In the court of New York social crimes, Ms. Roehm committed an unthinkable offense: she let a billionaire husband get away. As a result, she lost her design business (which he financed), her cachet on the charity circuit and her must-have status at A-list parties. For all the women who secretly hated her for her money and because at 5 feet 10 inches she weighed 114 pounds, it became open season. Her dress designs were good, sure, but not as good as those of her mentor, Oscar de la Renta, who gave her her start.
In 1991, after her company folded, a casualty of both the recession and the unexpected death of her stepson Harrison, she regrouped and started a catalogue business. Yes, that was promising -- in its first year it exceeded projected sales of $500,000 and grossed $3 million -- but truly, catalogues are so democratic, and the retailing operation behind this one had inventory problems. Ms. Roehm always insisted on only the best materials, and that just wasn't practical. So, once the husband went, there went the catalogue. Next.
Ms. Roehm, 46, knows all this, of course. Nestled in her overstuffed couch, barricaded by brocade and taffeta pillows, she talked about her book on flowers and her meaning was not lost. "I don't want to sound hokey," she said, "but if you see a perennial garden out of season, you think it will never come back and it does. Flowers are forever. Yes, they die, but another one always sprouts." She blushed. "I'm not gifted enough to explain this."
For a visual person, as she repeatedly calls herself, it's not a bad explanation. The thing about Carolyne Roehm that her detractors underestimate is a very important one: she is smart enough to know what she doesn't know, and she never stops trying to learn. But it was her drive for perfection, she admits, that did her in, both in her career and in her marriage. She would regularly rise at 6 A.M., exercise, take piano lessons, study French, work at the office 10 to 12 hours a day, organize enormous black-tie benefits and keep up not only the Park Avenue duplex and the Connecticut house, but also two homes in Southampton, a villa in the Dominican Republic, a ski house and a ranch in Colorado. Don't cry for me, Argentina? Try it first and see how long it would take to fall over.
"One hates a marriage to fail," Ms. Roehm said carefully. "It's so painful. But in the end it probably saved my life. Why was I so driven? You could speak to an analyst, I guess, who would say, 'She was so insecure she just had to prove herself in everything.' " She sighed, and seemed relieved that her two maids appeared to serve tea -- on silver trays with starched linen napkins.
Ms. Roehm leaned forward to pour, all limbs. She was wearing brown stretch pants that betrayed not a trace of body fat, though she claims to have gained 14 pounds since her divorce. "I know I was a cadaver," she said. "Now, I'll ride horses, play tennis and ski, but I don't want to exercise."
Her long arms shine with moisturizer, her dark brown hair shines with conditioner and her skin is unlined peaches and cream. Sipping tea, with her pointy chin and her upturned nose, she seemed familiar somehow. If Mary Poppins had married a mogul in New York in the 1980's, she would look like Carolyne Roehm.
"I'd wanted to be a fashion designer all my life and I wanted to be successful at it," she said. "When I met Henry in 1980, there hadn't been the big deals. Life was different." The couple married in 1985. "When I started my business I went through the whole thing about 'What if our romance falls apart?' " She smiled wryly. "It was the right question.
"But women responded to my clothes. Henry started doing huge deals. I actually learned from him about doing work for charity, that giving your time to raise money is a responsibility when you're very lucky. So I plunged into that. I'm not the type that can let go. The couple of times I didn't follow through 100 percent I thought less of myself. I was a strung-out wreck. I admit it -- I got caught up in the 80's and lost track of what was important in my life. I was on that fast track to nowhere."
But did she have to lose her business in the process? She sighed. "One gets married with the idea it will last forever," she said. "These are the risks you take in life. And you know what? I was a big girl. Henry gave me an opportunity to do things I never would have been able to do."
In addition to publishing "A Passion for Flowers," Ms. Roehm is once again getting into the catalogue business, selling home accessories under the name Home by Carolyne Roehm. This time, though, she owns the business herself and she's starting out small, with only 20 items. "I don't want to be a dog wagged by its tail," she said. "I want to grow this steadily. Yes, I love extravagant things but I want to give people value. All the merchandise is from Portugal -- and it's in stock. There's something about the European artisan that intrigues me."
Maybe so, though this room doesn't show it. Oil portraits by Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun, a friend and confidante of Marie Antoinette, hang everywhere and there are no fewer than five arrangements of roses. There are also gold candelabra, a marble bust mounted on a pedestal, a fireplace topped by a grand scrolled mirror and yards of art books. But for all its grandeur, it's still not enough to stop her eyes from filling when she talks about men ("I hope and pray I will be madly in love and want to be with someone all the time, but I don't know if that necessarily means marriage") and it doesn't stop her eyes from brimming when she recalls getting pregnant in vitro during her marriage and losing the baby.
"I'm thinking about adopting kids now," she said. "Strangely enough, while I might have missed my chance to do it, I don't think I would have been a very good mother. With the space I've had these last few years, I think now I would be O.K."
Can't she just hear people say: "And why not? You certainly can afford it." She nodded. "I think when people say nasty things it's not about you, it's about them. I am finally getting better about that. Not everyone is going to like me, not everyone is going to invite me, and there is nothing I can do about it. I make mistakes, like we all do. The people who work for me care for me. They are my extended family."
Her own family shrank with her father's death two years ago. Ms. Roehm was the only child of two educators, born in Kirksville, Mo., who had to suffer the indignity of a father who was her junior high school principal. Her mother, now retired, was a teacher and speech pathologist. Growing up in Missouri, Ms. Roehm, who was named Carolyne Jane Smith at birth and went by the name Janie, used to play dress-up with castoff gowns sent by relatives and dream of becoming a designer. The very first thing she ever bought herself was a rhinestone tiara -- from the Sears, Roebuck catalogue.
After graduating from Washington University in St. Louis, she moved to New York and worked for Kellwood, a company that manufactured sportswear for, appropriately enough, Sears. She then became, after much persistence, Oscar de la Renta's assistant and designed his Miss O collection. She took a yearlong intermission in 1978 to move to Darmstadt, Germany, and marry Axel Roehm, the heir to a chemical fortune, a union she has termed "disastrous."
When her own design business closed and her divorce from Mr. Kravis was finalized in 1994, she took off for Oxford University to study Shakespearean tragedy. "I used to say to Henry, 'How much money does one have to have in life before my fantasy of taking a year off and studying all the things I was too stupid to study in college would come true? Wouldn't it be fun?' " She smiled, though it was half grimace. "I don't think he thought it was so much fun." At Worcester College, she lived in a dorm room and loved it, before moving on to Paris and an apprenticeship with Henri Moulie, the grandmaster of flower arranging.
"Flowers are really what I love the most, in terms of things," she said. "Flowers so change the quality of your life, as does a good book or a piece of music. Nothing gives me greater pleasure."
After four months in Paris, she returned to Weatherstone, the Connecticut house, "back home to my garden," she said. "I'm lucky that a lot of people I really like are near my home in Connecticut and that everything I love is there -- my flowers, vegetables, six dogs, cats, horses. I just got two goats. There's a real spirit there. I laugh there, I cry there, I spend time alone there comfortably. I don't think I'm the flaky type in terms of spirituality, but home is my relationship with my animals and garden and house. All my senses are more finely tuned there. If I see my animals do something charming or find a huge dahlia that's a luscious red color, I physically feel that surge in my heart, like it's getting bigger. I have that there, not here."
Here, though, she sees friends for dinner, indulges her love for funny movies and white truffles and exults in the fact that she hasn't given one party in this apartment since last Christmas. Indeed, the only sounds that have punctuated the afternoon are the constant ringing of the phone and the fax in the next room. The sense of quiet anticipation, of new beginnings, is everywhere. What else could she want?
Again, her tireless radar for her own limitations goes up. "In my next life, I want to be funny," she said seriously. "Like Erma Bombeck. When other people are funny, I laugh, but I'd love to do it myself." She leaned back and sighed. "If nothing else, on my tombstone it will say: 'She was a very hard worker. She might not have been effective but, boy, she worked hard.' "

Welcome To the Club: Jazz Swings In New Spots

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
New Yorkers like to mention casually, as if it were painfully evident, that we have the best jazz in the world. That's obviously true, at times. But the scene here has long been top-heavy and ruled by a vicious cycle. The B flat blues you hear from jazz musicians goes like this: The market for unknown jazz being what it is, few young musicians get to make records. Budgets in jazz being what they are, the records that are made can be misproduced and badly distributed. And competition being what it is, a jazz musician can only get a plum gig if he has a few good records easily available.
Top-quality jazz in Manhattan has historically come out of the music schools or the biggest clubs, of which we are now lucky to have five: the Village Vanguard, Birdland, Sweet Basil, the Blue Note and Iridium. But school-band concerts are chancy propositions, and the Big Five have supplied your image of a jazz club: pricey, uptight, full of tourists and the occasional pinstriped businessman who falls asleep on the table after yelling "Go, man, go!" for an hour. 
 But the scene is changing. Over the last year or so, jazz has spread across Manhattan to new clubs, restaurants and cafes that don't fit the stereotype. There is probably more jazz around on a given night than there has been in a decade, and some of it is very cheap. More young players are being showcased; more experimental jazz is available; a more casual atmosphere prevails. At the same time, jazz artists of the huge middle ground -- those between the neophyte and the big-timer, who have spent their lives working abroad, teaching or serving as eternal sidemen -- finally have places to play.
The success of Smalls, a three-year-old club on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village, is partly responsible for the sprouting of new places. Smalls proved that you don't have to go to the Big Five to hear exciting, straight-ahead jazz. With its nonthreatening air and workshop environment, Smalls has become a launching pad for young musicians schooled in the rigors of be-bop but stretching the idiom. Meanwhile, the downtown jazz scene that used to be nurtured at the Knitting Factory in TriBeCa has spread to newer places, since that club has recently tilted toward rock and dance music.
Trios and quartets can easily set up in a corner in places like the Izzy Bar, Detour or the Zinc Bar, where the saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, with a new quintet, created two fascinating evenings this month. But even a big band, the most impractical and economically unwieldy of jazz concepts, has a chance to grow in some small spaces. In one recent week, I heard two excellent and completely unrecognized big bands: one at the Neo Lounge in the West Village, led by Joey Sellers, and another at the Internet Cafe, led by Chuck Clark. Not much of this music has been written about or sniffed out for commercial potential.
The new spots range from the Jazz Standard, a bona fide jazz club with weeklong engagements, which opened on Tuesday and is attached to a chic restaurant; to Metronome, a restaurant where a different band sets up every night in a corner overlooking Broadway in the Flatiron district; to the East Village restaurant Opaline.
There's the Savoy Lounge, hard by the Port Authority Bus Terminal; the Minetta Lane Theater off the Avenue of the Americas in the Village; the Internet Cafe, a tiny, homey coffeehouse on East Third Street; the Bowery Bar, a hot downtown spot that will soon start a Monday night jazz series, and the Lenox Lounge, the Art Deco club in Harlem.
At some of these places, the musicians are creating their own opportunities to perform. The best news: Few of these clubs charge more than $10 for admission.
The jazz world tends to take itself very seriously, thriving on "its own marginalized status," said Samantha Black, who signs jazz artists for the record label Verve. "So we end up with these jazz-club environments that are like museums. That's not the way jazz used to be. You didn't just go to revere; there was an engagement.
"What's great about these new places is that young people aren't overwhelmed by the cost, so they aren't also overwhelmed by the threat that they might not understand the music, or the fear that they're in a too-rarefied crowd."
Here is a look at some of the new jazz clubs in Manhattan.
 
The Jazz Standard
On the soigne end of the scale, there's the newest in town, the Jazz Standard, in what used to be the Rosenblum Perfume factory, on 27th Street at Lexington Avenue. At street level, there's the restaurant, 27 Standard, with a full wine list and a contemporary American-style menu; the chef is Michael Smith, who used to work at the Rainbow Room and the Hudson River Club.
Downstairs, the Jazz Standard has room for 150 patrons, a size comparable to the Big Five, with its own menu, running from pizza to caviar. (Two layers of insulation have been installed so the diners upstairs won't be disturbed by the music.) The ducts of the former factory on the ceilings and walls have been kept intact as part of the decor.
Since Birdland opened on West 44th Street with its all-star schedules, what's needed now is a club that showcases musicians signed to smaller labels or those about to break the surface of media attention. Accordingly, the Jazz Standard's owner, James Polsky, a former jazz drummer, has booked the room through January with younger musicians like the saxophonist Don Braden, who plays there through this weekend; the vibraphonist Stefon Harris; the pianist Jonny King, and the saxophonist Mark Shim.
 
Minetta Lane Theater
Less bound to the financial vicissitudes of the food-and-drink business is the jazz series at the Minetta Lane Theater in Greenwich Village.
The theater has excellent sound and seats 350, twice as many people as the biggest club in New York. When the house empties on weekends (the Minetta Lane currently has a successful long-running play, "Gross Indecency"), the jazz begins. On Monday, when the theater is dark, the music starts earlier in the evening.
Drinks are sold at the concession stand in the lobby. Tickets run as low as $5, and though the first few concerts had small audiences, Roy Hargrove's big band nearly sold out for two shows on a recent Sunday night.
The philosophy here is simple: "We're trying to make jazz attractive to young people," said Mike Kolker, producer of the concerts. Indeed, you couldn't otherwise hear Mr. Hargrove in a theater or a club at this price. But Mr. Kolker is also bringing in young band leaders like Greg Tardy and Omer Avital, and he plans to adopt the rock-club practice of having lesser-known bands open for big names.
The positive effect of the $5 ticket in jazz is nearly incalculable. If you've spent $20 to cross the threshold of a club and another $10 for drinks, you might feel too guilty to cheer; you sit still and absorb, trying to get every penny's worth. And it goes without saying that struggling musicians can't afford to hear their heroes at high prices.
"When I want to see the Joe Lovano-Paul Motian-Bill Frisell Trio at a club, I literally have to save money for a month," said Tony Malaby, one of the best young tenor saxophonists in town, who just gave up his day job selling fly-fishing gear. But if it's cheaper than a movie, you tend to let yourself go. As at Smalls, the bands feed off the energy of the crowd.
 
Bell Caffe, Jules, Alt.Coffee
On the more experimental end of the spectrum, musicians are taking greater control of their work, creating new situations for themselves, even starting their own record companies.
"A lot of people are getting tired of waiting for calls," said the saxophonist Tim Berne, who has formed his own record label, Screw Gun, and who's just as likely now to perform at the Internet Cafe in the East Village as the Knitting Factory, where his free-ranging music was almost exclusively heard.
At restaurants like the Bell Caffe and Jules, groups led by the saxophonists Dan Willis and Michael Blake have been able to get regular engagements; this is how bands grow into maturity. The trumpeter Dave Douglas started a group out of a regular engagement at the Bell some years ago; it has grown into one of the more exciting trios in jazz, and it's called the Tiny Bell Trio, in the restaurant's honor.
Alt.Coffee, a cafe on Avenue A at St. Marks Place in the East Village, is another good example. It's a friendly joint where loners read books and students chat for hours: a captive audience. Ted Reichman, an accordionist and composer, saw the opportunity there. For a year, with the drummer John Hollenbeck and the vibraphonist Matt Moran, he's been booking experimental improvised music and jazz into the club every Monday night for free concerts; he plans to produce a mini-festival there in January.
Mr. Reichman said he was "inspired by how things work in San Francisco and Chicago," where the do-it-yourself ethos has resulted in thriving performance scenes.
A band playing at Alt.Coffee can stretch out across a whole evening, make more money than at an established club, with the help of a tip jar, and draw greater interest from the regular habitues. One recent night, the cafe was standing-room-only for a performance of Mr. Hollenbeck's quartet, with percussion, voice, saxophone and steel guitar.
By contrast, although playing at the Knitting Factory still has an element of prestige (European promoters hold the club in awe as an imprimatur for new music), as many as five bands may play there in one night. A band can sometimes get overlooked; it's hard to create a following with a few performances there in the course of a year.
 
Internet Cafe
The Internet Cafe is another grass-roots success story. Nearly two years ago, the cafe's owner, Arthur Perle, asked the saxophonist Hayes Greenfield to bring in music; now it's grown into a six-night-a-week schedule.
"They let musicians try out new things," said the saxophonist Sam Newsome, who has played there with his band, Global Unity. The club is starting to present musicians like Ellery Eskelin and Marty Ehrlich who once played most of their New York gigs at the Knitting Factory.
For the last year, Chuck Clark has led a dynamic 10-piece big band at the Internet, full of excellent players like the trombonist Chris Washburne and the alto saxophonist Matt Hong. Like many of the bookings there, the group's sound mixes swing with odd rhythmic structures, harmony with dissonance. It's a territory that Mr. Malaby, who has also played there with his own groups, describes in jazz terms as "too outside for Smalls, too inside for the Knitting Factory."
About 60 feet long and 12 feet wide, the club has a middle area where the musicians play; waiters walk right through the bandstand. It feels a bit like home: the magazine rack is full, and the manager's golden retreiver, Homer, sometimes takes naps in the bathroom.
 
Detour
Another hive for developing talent is Detour, a small no-cover jazz bar on East 13th Street in the East Village, which opened two years ago and now presents bands seven nights a week. Its owner, Art Zeidman, a working musician, was inspired by small jazz clubs in Amsterdam that had a casual atmosphere and vital music.
The bands are not paid, which prevents a lot of musicians from performing there on principle, but Mr. Zeidman has helped young players develop their craft, including Mr. Hong and the trombonist Mike Fahn.
One musician characterizes it as "Augie's downtown," a reference to the Morningside Heights bar Augie's, where students escaping homework go to chat loudly, occasionally noticing that someone a few feet away is pouring his heart out for tips. But Detour has a small upright piano, which Augie's does not, as well as a less beer-slinging atmosphere.
 
Homefront
Homefront, on the ground floor of a West 54th Street bed-and-breakfast, is modeling itself on the downtown lofts of a generation ago where disgruntled jazz musicians declared independence by producing their own concerts. A long, high-ceilinged room filled with sofas and comfortable chairs, it's a pleasant and relaxed post-dinner or post-theater hangout, with beer and wine for sale.
The style of the music booked there has varied dramatically, from the rhythm-and-blues gutbucket kick of James (Jabbo) Ware's Me, We and Them Orchestra, to Zusaan Kali Fasteau's wild and pancultural free jazz. As is the case with most of these places, it doesn't feel like a jazz club.
In the New York jazz scene, the Big Five shall remain and prosper, but perhaps only as one kind of jazz experience. It's time to take the old image, wipe it clean and start again.

HEADLINE: NYC;
Appearing In the Role Of Underdog

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
IF you think about Ruth W. Messinger's campaign in cinematic terms, just for the heck of it, a couple of film models suggest themselves. "Rocky" is always a possibility. You know the drill: an underdog, given no chance, slogs on against all odds, winning hearts if not the title.
Then there's "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" 
 That may sound terribly unkind. But the "put her out of her misery" despair of that film is hard to shake off as the New York City mayoral race limps to the finish line. Could things be any worse for Ms. Messinger?
Polls show her getting clobbered on Tuesday. All the major New York dailies are endorsing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Her earnest campaign style, dripping with figures and facts, generates few sparks. She is trying to persuade voters that the city's glass is half empty, what with crumbling schools and homelessness, only to find herself caught out of sync in a glass-is-half-full era, with people feeling good about lowered crime and rising municipal revenues.
Whether it is her own fault or a case of editorial dereliction, she has suffered a virtual news brownout on television, with local stations skipping most of her public events in favor of really important stories like Marv Albert's incisors. Then, too, she has endured one defection after another by fellow Democrats, who as a group have proved about as faithful as Prince Charles.
Put all that together and you can understand why Mr. Giuliani's unexpected compliment on Wednesday night -- his reference in their debate to her "distinguished career in public service" -- sounded as though he were not praising her as much as administering last rites.
Given that pileup of adversities, the real question may be how she can keep up her 17- and 18-hour days so enthusiastically. At 7:30 A.M. yesterday, there she was yet again outside a subway station, this time the Parkchester stop on the No. 6 line in the Bronx, greeting riders and smiling broadly, looking for all the world like someone who had this election in the bag.
Maybe "Rocky" is a bit over the top as a reference. But a 60-something man watching her admired her doggedness, even as he confessed that he would vote for Mr. Giuliani.
"I can go out at night," he said. "Four years ago, I couldn't do that. The streets are cleaner, too." But as he watched the Democratic candidate, he added: "She has guts, I'll say that for her. I feel sorry for the woman. Her own party has deserted her, and I'm a Democrat myself."
Naturally, the general assumption that this race is over does take its toll, Ms. Messinger acknowledged the day before as she rode to the A. Philip Randolph Senior Center, on West 146th Street, where she was accompanied by former Mayor David N. Dinkins, and loosened up enough to share a brief dance with him.
"I promise you it hasn't been easy doing this every day," she said. "But I feel it's important to do it."
"Look, I entered this race for a reason," she said. "There are a set of things that are important to me and need to be addressed in this campaign. This has all been about a very consistent set of issues. I've been talking about these kinds of issues for 20 years."
SHE ticked off themes that have formed the core of her anti-Giuliani attacks: overcrowded schools and outdated textbooks, police brutality, an expanding homeless population and a local unemployment rate that is nearly twice the national average, for all the let-the-good-times-roll feelings.
"It's good that crime has gone down, and it's good that the economy has improved for some people," Ms. Messinger said. "But as a city, we have to say: What next? What are the problems looming out there that have to be addressed?" New York City's "genius" has been to see issues coming round the bend, she said, adding, "It takes a leader to say, 'Here's the next crisis.' "
Of course, even if she's correct about the issues that lie ahead, the polls suggest that voters do not consider her, absolutely no pun intended, the right messenger.
But it was interesting how Mr. Giuliani, who usually suggests that he has turned New York into the Emerald City all on his own, suddenly acknowledged in Wednesday's debate that every problem has not been solved, that not everyone has prospered from recent economic successes, that job growth has not been enough and -- mirabile dictu -- that Mr. Dinkins deserves to share credit for the drop in crime.
It may yet turn out that Ms. Messinger's biggest contribution, should the Mayor indeed win, was showing him where that half-empty glass was.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Post Sharp Rise; Crude Oil Up on Iraq Worries

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gold prices rose sharply yesterday, buoyed by uncertainty over the Asian financial crisis and fears that tensions between the United States and Iraq would escalate.
On other markets, the Iraqi situation also bolstered energy futures, while coffee fell sharply. 
 Gold prices this week have staged a moderate recovery from the 12-year lows that came last week on expectations that central banks would sell their reserves. In recent days, investors have been seeking a haven for their money amid increasing instability in world markets.
Gold prices were further buoyed by fears of a new confrontation between Iraq and the United States after the Iraqi Government barred two Americans from entering the country yesterday. The two were part of a United Nations weapons inspections team.
Gold prices were further helped by comments from Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger of Switzerland, who said he was opposed to selling half of Switzerland's gold reserve, as was proposed by a Government panel last week.
Despite those comments, the market is likely to remain under pressure because of expectations that other central banks will sell much of their reserves.
Gold for December delivery rose $2.80, to $317.20 an ounce, after rising as high as $319.30 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange; December silver rose 7.2 cents, to $4.867 an ounce.
Crude oil, heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices jumped for a second day on the New York Mercantile Exchange because of concerns over the Iraqi dispute.
December crude rose 51 cents, to $21.22 a barrel; November heating oil rose 0.93 cent, to 58.12 cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose 0.58 cent, to 60.67 cents a gallon.
Coffee prices fell sharply on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York after the National Coffee Federation in Colombia denied reports that a virus had been found in northwestern growing regions, where the coffee trees provide much of the world's supply of gourmet arabica beans.
December coffee fell 2.45 cents, to $1.482 a pound.

HEADLINE: Sony Profit Up Sharply, Aided by Film Studio

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation said today that earnings rose sharply in the latest six months as demand for its digital electronic products soared and the film "Men in Black" helped lead a revival at its Hollywood studios.
The company raised its forecast for sales and earnings in the current fiscal year, citing rising global demand for products like its Playstation video-game system, video cameras and cellular telephones. 
 Sony's success in selling those items was matched in the six-month period by a strong performance from its film division, whose top management was replaced after a string of costly high-profile flops like "The Cable Guy" and "Striptease."
Summer hits including "Men in Black," "Air Force One" and "My Best Friend's Wedding" helped push revenue from the movie business up 59 percent from a year earlier, to 301 billion yen, or $2.5 billion. That accounted for about 10 percent of sales over all.
In the six months that ended Sept. 30, group pretax profit rose 84.6 percent, to 202.1 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, from 109.43 billion yen a year earlier. Net income gained 75.7 percent, to 90.93 billion yen from 51.74 billion. Sales rose 21 percent, to 3.069 trillion yen from 2.531 trillion.
The yen's decline against the dollar helped the results. As the Japanese currency weakens, the yen value of profits from overseas increases, allowing Japan's exporters to cut prices abroad without harming earnings.
Overseas sales accounted for almost 80 percent of total sales during the period. Sales in the United States rose 32 percent, to 958 billion yen.
Despite the weak Japanese economy -- consumer spending has been hurt by a tax increase imposed in April -- Sony's domestic sales rose 19 percent.
Sony said the recent plunge by Southeast Asian currencies would not hurt earnings because the company produced more goods in the region for export to other areas than it sold there.
The results were released after the close of stock trading today in Tokyo. Sony shares closed with a loss of 200 yen, to 9,900 yen, in a lower market. The shares are more than 43 percent higher than they were a year ago. Sony's American depository receipts rose 87.5 cents, to $83.24.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rally as 30-Year Treasury's Yield Slips to 6.14%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds ended mostly higher yesterday, deriving strength from another decline in the wobbly stock market and diminished fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates anytime soon. It was the fourth time in five days that the bond market has rallied, reflecting the growing allure of stable fixed-income securities, compared with the seesaw behavior of stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 554.26 points Monday, rebounded 337.17 points Tuesday and zigzagged to end 8.35 points higher Wednesday, dropped sharply in another gyration yesterday to end 125 points lower. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond increased 27/32, to 103 7/32. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and can signal future interest rate trends, eased to 6.14 percent from 6.20 percent on Wednesday. Most shorter-term maturities also rose in price.
Bond investors largely brushed aside reports on the economy that suggested further strength and possible inflationary pressure, which typically tend to hurt bond prices.
The Commerce Department said new-home sales in September fell slightly but remained above an annual rate of 800,000 for a fourth consecutive month, the longest stretch in 19 years. The Labor Department reported an unexpected drop in weekly claims for unemployment insurance, suggesting demand for workers remains robust. The Conference Board's help-wanted index, a barometer of the supply of jobs, rose to 87 in September from 85 in August.
Despite this evidence of further economic vitality, many bond market investors apparently feel the Fed's policy-making committee will not seek to slow growth with a dose of higher interest rates when it meets Nov. 12.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the central bank, broadly hinted in Congressional testimony Wednesday that the Fed would refrain from raising rates and suggested the stock market's turbulence would help slow the economy on its own, by making consumers less willing to spend.
A further hint of optimism about lower rates in the bond market was seen in when-issued trading ahead of next week's quarterly Treasury refunding, with yields noticeably lower yesterday. The new three-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.65 percent, down 4 basis points from the previous day. The 10-year note was priced to yield 5.85 percent, down 5 basis points, and the 30-year bond, 6.11 percent, down 6 basis points. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Yesterday, the Treasury auctioned $21.12 billion of 80-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.18 percent. Cash management bills are used to meet the Government's short-term cash needs outside the regular schedule of bills, notes and bonds.
The following are the results of that auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price 98.849
Discounted Rate 5.18%
Coupon Yield 5.31%
High Price 98.851
Discounted Rate 5.18%
Coupon Yield 5.31%
Low Price 98.849

Coupon Yield 5.30%
Accepted at low price 59%
Total applied for $66,320,035
Accepted $21,139,435
Noncompetitive 35
 
The 80-day cash management bills mature on Jan. 22, 1998.

Dudley Gambles On Knicks

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
HIS degree in economics from Yale notwithstanding, Chris Dudley rejected a guaranteed offer of $16 million over four years from the Detroit Pistons and accepted a shade over $1 million to play this season for the Knicks. No one has called yet from New Haven, demanding he return the diploma.
"Detroit was going to start me at $3 million this year and jack it up," Dudley said the other day, stretching out his 6-foot-11-inch frame in a folding chair after Knicks' practice in Purchase, N.Y. He shrugged his coat hanger shoulders. "I have to make up $2 million. It's a risk, but if I lose, I lose." 
 The party line is that Dudley can't lose, that the Knicks have promised to re-sign him next summer to a glorious new deal that will allow him to explore one of his potential post-playing careers: real estate, and at Manhattan prices.
"We heard they promised him $18 million for the next three years -- six, six and six," a Pistons official who did not want his name used said yesterday.
Salary cap circumvention is what the National Basketball Association screamed when it challenged the shifty three-way deal arranged by Portland, Toronto and New York. But that is a migraine-inducing subject that we want no part of on the day actual basketball games will be played.
The 13th installment of the Patrick Ewing era begins in Charlotte tonight, and somehow the notion of a Yalie economics major putting money he doesn't even have on the Knicks is an intriguing (some would say nutty) subplot to another climb up Mount St. Michael. Let's not be naive about this: Dudley was most likely assured he would be taken care of, but these are the Knicks we are talking about. Their best-laid plans could wander off the figurative bench, and drop into oblivion.
Dudley is always an injury risk, with his history of foot and back problems. And N.B.A. lawyers are massing at the bargaining table for another assault on the so-called soft cap, which allows teams to pay their own players whatever they want. Then Dudley must consider a third possibility of peril: the Knicks bomb out early in the playoffs again and someone in their multilayered corporate hierarchy starts measuring the team's results against its staggering payroll.
To the credit of the organization (and the customers who keep swallowing one retirement savings-gutting ticket price increase after another), no expense has been spared, in the continuing attempt to squeeze one championship out of the Ewing era.
An upgrade in talent two summers ago that cost $150 million in contracts? Done. Four years and $65 million for a sore-kneed, 35-year-old Ewing? No problem. Another $33 million guaranteed contract to fortify Jeff Van Gundy's bench? Chris Mills, come on down.
The Knicks' swelling annual payroll stands at $52 million, twice the salary cap, and about what it took for the Florida Marlins to compensate 25 players. Yes, it is less than Chicago's payroll, but the Bulls do have Michael Jordan, who makes roughly twice the gross national product of France.
At some point, if the Knicks do not ride the playoff train well beyond their second-round step-off station of the past three seasons, the hard-core personnel analysis will be done. It will ask why a $70 million player (Larry Johnson) was not good enough to carry the small forward position, necessitating the sacrifice of the promising (and low-paid) Walter McCarty and the acquisition of Mills. It will ask why a $24 million point guard (Chris Childs) is not good enough to start and why a $56 million shooting guard (Allan Houston) isn't averaging at least 20 points a game.
It will pose these questions to Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' president and general manager, and then wonder why another $18 million should be invested in a backup center.
That, of course, is negative thinking, unacceptable during preseason, unless Van Gundy was whining about his team's effort or Charles Oakley was mumbling what no one but the news media wanted to hear.
It's difficult to argue with the Knicks' strategy to go for it now, while Ewing can still produce, though it runs contrary to the teams positioning themselves to win when Jordan, like Joe DiMaggio, has gone away.
The goals of Dudley's previous teams, the Nets and Portland, were to mark everyone present for the start of practice. Commitment to winning has never been the Knicks' problem, but instead of them or us forecasting yes or no, let's settle back and see what happens. They begin tonight, and then Dudley's might-have-been teammate, Grant Hill, comes to town.
As Ewing would say, see you Sunday.

HEADLINE: Home Sales and Job Data Show Some Economic Vigor

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Fresh evidence emerged today of strong new-home sales and declining unemployment that showed considerable vigor in the economy before the stock market's wild gyrations this week.
Sales of new single-family homes fell two-tenths of a percent in September to a still-strong seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000 a year, the Commerce Department said. 
 It was the second decline in a row. Yet September was the fourth consecutive month in which sales were at or above the 800,000 rate, the longest such stretch in 19 years.
In another sign of economic vitality, the Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance fell by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 297,000 last week, the lowest since late July. The four-week average, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, fell to 305,250 from 308,250 the previous week, the department said.
Many economists say the drop in the stock market will reduce consumers' accumulated wealth and dampen economic growth this year, and that eventually should cause companies to cut back hiring a bit.
Since the winter, the national unemployment rate has been at or below 5 percent, the lowest sustained joblessness in 24 years.
"We'll have tight labor markets for a while, but not tighter," said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "As we get into 1998, we'll have a significant slowing down."
The robust job market and the income gains that result have been key elements supporting housing this year, as have low mortgage rates.
The stock weakness, if sustained, could both help and hurt the housing market. It helps by reducing mortgage rates, a side effect of an investor migration into the relative safety of Treasury bonds, which serve as benchmarks for mortgage rates.
However, declining stock values reduce the resources that consumers can call upon to make housing down payments. That can diminish home buying, said David Seiders, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders.
During the first nine months of the year, new-home sales were running 5.7 percent ahead of the corresponding period in 1996. The supply of new homes for sale -- 286,000 in September and August -- was the slimmest in four years. That is in line with analyst expectations that sales will taper off next year.
Mr. Seiders said he was forecasting 798,000 new-home sales this year and 750,000 in 1998.
By region in September, sales of new homes plunged 12.2 percent in the Northeast, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 65,000, the lowest in 16 months. They also fell 3.7 percent in the South, but jumped 9 percent in the West and rose 2.1 percent in the Midwest.
Nationally, the median price of a new home, meaning that half sold for more and half for less, was $142,000 in September, up 2.2 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Fed Nominees

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Senate confirmed President Clinton's two nominees to the Federal Reserve Board today. Both are mainstream economists who stress the importance of restraining inflation.
Edward Gramlich, 58, a University of Michigan economist with broad experience in budget policy and social welfare, and Roger Ferguson, 46, a banking and management specialist at the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Company, were confirmed by a voice vote. 
 Both are highly respected economists with views broadly similar to those of their colleagues on the Fed, who emphasize fighting inflation with the aim of promoting long-term sustainable growth.
The Fed board, which normally has seven members, has been operating with five governors since the start of the year, when Janet Yellen left to lead Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and Lawrence Lindsey joined a Washington research organization.
The nominations sailed through after Senator Tom Harkin stopped blocking them. Senator Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, is a frequent critic of the Fed, which he says keeps interest rates too high and economic growth too low for America's small businesses and working families.
Mr. Gramlich fills Ms. Yellen's seat, and his term expires Jan. 31, 2008.
Mr. Ferguson fills the seat vacated by Mr. Lindsey, whose unexpired term runs until Jan. 31, 2000.

HEADLINE: Reconsidering A Trade Equation;
Why a Stronger Dollar Hasn't Brought a Drop in Exports

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
As the dollar strengthened this year, Ronald D. Bullock, president of the Bison Gear and Engineering Company near Chicago, raised his prices in francs and marks for the metal transmission gears that he exports to Europe. But his customers stuck with him, drawn by Bison Gear's new willingness to custom-design the gears -- similar in shape to bicycle sprockets -- for each factory machine whose speed they regulate. And Bison's exports have risen, despite the sticker shock.
"We hire a lot more engineers today than we ever have before to do this custom-designing," Mr. Bullock said. 
 Stories like these proliferate among the nation's manufacturers. Added together, they explain why a longstanding economic verity -- that a nation's exports begin to fall after its currency has risen in value for 18 months or so -- has failed to kick in during the current strengthening of the dollar, which began two years ago.
American business has responded much more than in the early 1980's, the last time the dollar moved up sharply. This time it cut costs, shaved prices and profit margins, developed products, sold harder. The unexpected export vigor has added significantly to the nation's sales, here and abroad, and has bolstered the economy, helping to prolong the expansion into its seventh year.
"American manufacturers have managed to export against the odds," said Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute, a research group.
At the same time, however, the robust dollar makes it easier and less costly for America's trading partners to export more to this country, and they are doing just that. Despite the growth in American exports, foreign companies are selling more in the United States than American business sells abroad. The turmoil in Southeast Asia, with its currencies falling in value, will only increase these sales to America.
The merchandise trade deficit, as a result, has widened considerably in recent years, even surpassing the record level reached a decade ago. But in contrast to the furor that the trade gap created then, it is greeted today almost with indifference.
"The difference is really in the perception," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics. "People no longer think it is a reflection of some underlying weakness in American competitiveness."
Allied Signal Inc., of Morristown, N.J., offers one explanation for why exports are rising even while the dollar strengthens. Airline travel is booming everywhere, and Allied is a big exporter of engines and parts for commercial aircraft. Demand is driving sales. So are long-term contracts. Big customers like Dessault of France, maker of Falcon business jets equipped with Allied engines, cannot easily switch suppliers. "That's impractical," said Marc Greenberg, an Allied spokesman.
AMP Inc. of Harrisburg, Pa., provides another insight into the nation's export performance. AMP exports to itself, a growing American practice largely impervious to exchange rates. AMP is shipping connectors for Pentium chips to its plants in Asia, where they are installed in electronic equipment sold in the region. The company also sends computer cables and connectors to its Mexican plant, where they are attached to one another and imported back into the States for AMP to sell. Sixty percent of America's merchandise exports to Mexico fell into this category last year, according to one recent study. And Mexico is America's fastest-growing export market, after Canada.
"The question is, do we use intelligent, flexible Mexican labor for this assembly work," said William J. Hudson, AMP's chief executive, "or do we install an expensive piece of automated equipment in the United States? We prefer the flexible Mexican labor, particularly since models change so often."
No one knows how much stronger the dollar has to get for exports, even AMP's, to stop rising. The United States is not the first nation to experience a rising currency and, at the same time, rising exports. Japan, for one, is an old hand at this, and Americans are becoming more adept, too.
Thousands of small manufacturers, for example, have doubled and tripled their sales abroad in recent years, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. Like Bison Gear, which has $35 million a year in revenue, 10 percent of it from exports, they often find ways to offset the costs of a rising dollar.
The stronger dollar does not kick in everywhere, and that helps as well. The dollar has not strengthened in recent months against the currencies of America's two largest export markets, Canada and Mexico. Both have absorbed bigger shares of United States exports in the last year.
In Europe and Japan, where the dollar is much stronger, some American companies have resisted increasing their prices in francs, marks or yen, even though that has meant lower dollar revenue and lower profit margins for each item sold.
"You are getting falling dollar prices for American exports, more than you would expect," Mr. Godley said. "One wonders how long that can last."
Varian Associates Inc., a multinational based in Palo Alto, Calif., gambled on freezing the price in Europe and Japan for its chromatographs, industrial instruments that sell for upwards of $40,000 and identify invisible elements in a substance. The pricing gamble paid off.
"We found, to our surprise, that we sold more units, nearly 20 percent more," said J. Tracy O'Rourke, Varian's chairman. "And that kept our export revenue over the past year flat at $150 million. The demand is there for state-of-the-art capital equipment, if it is not too pricey."
Though each chromatograph is less profitable now, the greater number of units sold has maintained Varian's overall return for this piece of equipment, Mr. O'Rourke said. Cost-cutting, an increasingly important activity as the dollar rises, has also helped. Varian found a way to use one circuit board, costing $1,000, in each instrument, in place of five.
There is the downside, of course, to this export success story. A stronger dollar -- it has risen roughly 16 percent since mid-1995 when measured against the currencies of America's major trading partners -- means that more francs or marks or yen are needed to equal the same number of dollars in sales.
By the same token, though, foreigners who export to the United States need fewer dollars to make the same profits in their weakened currencies. So they can charge less for their products in the United States, encouraging Americans to buy more from abroad.
And for all the resilience of American exports, imports are rising even faster. That translates into a widening merchandise trade deficit, to a record $191 billion last year and a projected level of roughly the same size this year, compared with $173.6 billion in 1995. The previous high, before the 1990's, was a gap of $159 billion in 1987.
Remember the nationwide eruption of hand-wringing and attacks on Japan over that deficit? The public angst finally disappeared in the early 1990's as the trade deficit fell and as Japan's once-impregnable economy fell into decline. Now the deficit is rising again, even passing the old 1987 level, but the dogs that barked so loudly in the 1980's are just beginning to arouse themselves.
A broader measure of the nation's international transactions is also going deeper into deficit. The current-account balance, which covers not only trade but the nation's other overseas transactions -- tourism, investments, services, brokerage fees, international phone tolls, even dollars sent by immigrants to families back home -- reached $148 billion last year. And this year, it could exceed $150 billion.
That is close to the record current-account deficit of $168 billion, also set in 1987, although still much less as a percentage of the nation's annual income. Fortuitously for the American economy, the strong export performance this year -- totaling $447.5 billion through August in merchandise alone, or 11 percent ahead of last year -- acts as a brake on this rising deficit. Service-sector exports help, too. They are much smaller, but rising fast.
A decade ago, the national wail over the big deficit in the nation's international transactions held that Americans were, in effect, borrowing abroad to pay for a profligate life style, and that the next generation would have to repay the accumulating bill, reducing its own living standard to do so. Such talk is all but forgotten today. The bulging deficit is billed as more of a blessing than a curse.
The old profligacy issue -- that Americans were spending wastefully beyond what they could afford on their own -- has given way to a more hopeful view of how the money is being used. Now the foreign money flowing into the country is said to be stimulating investment in American factory operations and other productive facilities.
The Clinton Administration subscribes to this optimistic assessment, and there is evidence of it in Government statistics. "The earnings from these investments mean that going forward we will have the wherewithal to pay back the foreign debt," said Janet Yellen, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
A decade ago, the flood of imports meant, to many, that higher-paying manufacturing jobs were shifting abroad as imports replaced goods made here. That is still a popular view; the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group, for example, concluded in a new study that imports are shutting down some domestic production, forcing workers into lower-paying service jobs.
Many experts, however, argue optimistically that imports, far from crowding out domestic production, are a necessary and welcome supplement for an economy that is close to fully employed. The imports, in this view, make up the shortfall.
"At a time of full employment, it does not make sense to think of the trade deficit as costing jobs," Ms. Yellen said.
The Asian crisis could challenge this view, if those countries respond by flooding the United States with inexpensive goods, and by cutting back the demand for American exports of machinery and heavy equipment. Most of that is for public works projects that hard-pressed Asian governments might now postpone.
A downturn in the American economy would also eat away at the optimism. "People would look at the rising unemployment," Mr. Bergsten said, "and they would inevitably blame the trade deficit." The issue could easily work its way into the next Presidential election.
The one broad area where the rising dollar has hurt exports is in commodities -- Allied Signal's exports, for instance, of chemicals, fibers and plastics that can now be purchased for less overseas. For Allied, these exports have fallen this year, but not by enough to offset the overseas demand for the company's aircraft parts. So Allied's total exports rose to $1.23 billion in the first six months, from $1.14 billion in the corresponding period last year.
"We have a lot riding," Mr. Greenberg said, "on the growing demand for airline travel."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS SET TO LEND $3 BILLION TO HELP BOLSTER INDONESIA

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The United States will announce Friday that it is committing roughly $3 billion to what senior Administration officials describe as a "second line of defense" to aid Indonesia -- the first direct American financial contribution to restore financial stability in Southeast Asia.
The announcement will be made Friday morning, after the International Monetary Fund announces a $15 billion emergency aid package for the nation of 200 million people, the world's fourth-most-populous country. But this situation is the reverse of the bailout of Mexico in 1995, in which the United States took the lead and the I.M.F. provided backup financing. 
 The fund's loans come with a number of strings attached, including wide-ranging austerity measures that may prove painful for the family of Indonesia's authoritarian ruler, President Suharto.
"We don't expect that Indonesia will need to draw on our direct help," one senior Administration official said. "But what we need to address here is an atmosphere of contagion" that has spread in the form of extraordinary instability to currency and stock markets around the globe.
The strategy to be announced Friday was developed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers. And its intent is clearly to send a simultaneous message to governments and investors around the globe: That the United States, the world's largest economy, has decided that the risks to worldwide markets have grown enough in recent weeks that it must show a willingness to intervene.
Indeed, the American plan came together after another rough day on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 125 points, or 1.67 percent, and losses were particularly severe for several American banks that investors fear could be exposed to significant losses in emerging markets like Asia. Page D1.
But American officials said they had no fear that Asia's problems would create instability in the American banking system, as it has in Japan. Japanese banks were among the heaviest lenders in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong, where the market losses have been the heaviest.
As in the Mexico bailout, the American loans, if needed, will come from the Emergency Stabilization Fund, set up by the Roosevelt Administration more than half a century ago to stabilize the United States dollar on world markets. The fund is administered by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, and funds can be lent without the approval of Congress. In Mexico's case, $12 billion in loans from the fund were repaid last summer.
Even though American funds will not be immediately dispersed, today's action represents a reversal of strategy for the Clinton Administration.
When the I.M.F. put together a $17.2 billion bailout package for Thailand in August, the United States helped draw up the conditions -- including sharp austerity requirements that have led to protests in Thailand -- but did not contribute funds. Treasury Department officials argued that a direct financial contribution from Washington was not called for in Thailand's case because it appeared at the time that there was little risk that the country's financial troubles -- fueled by speculative attacks on its currency -- would spread to other markets.
It did. And clearly American officials are concerned that unless the contagion is stopped in Indonesia -- a country with a history of much stronger economic performance than Thailand -- it could quickly envelop other emerging markets around the world. Brazil has been particularly hard hit in recent days.
There is a political calculation at work as well. Asian officials have complained that the United States has insisted on a major role, as the largest contributor to the I.M.F., in setting the conditions for the fund's bailout programs -- even though little American money was at risk.
"This became an untenable policy," one State Department official said this week. "If you want to deal the cards, you have to buy some chips."
The main announcement on Friday will come from the I.M.F., which has been negotiating with the Government of President Suharto for two weeks on the fiscal changes that Indonesia must make in return for the $15 billion aid package. Two billion dollars will come from the World Bank, and $3 billion from the Asian Development Bank, based in Manila.
Indonesia will have to agree to a number of conditions, including some that may threaten huge, Government-backed projects that have greatly enriched members of President Suharto's family and fueled Indonesia's reputation as one of the most corrupt nations in Asia.
In what may be a partial concession to the I.M.F., Indonesian officials have said this week that the company building Indonesia's national car, PT Timor Putra Nasional, is removing President Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, as president of the company. But his replacement will be drawn from another, related company that is also controlled by the Suharto family.
The car project has become a symbol of how the aging Mr. Suharto has come to rule his country. Indonesia outraged Japan, the United States and the European Union last year when it exempted the company from the huge tariffs that are applied to the import of all cars and car parts entering the country, giving it a huge advantage over foreign car makers. A protest over that is pending at the World Trade Organization.
Asian diplomats said today that President Suharto, who is 76, had approved the austerity plan mandated by the I.M.F., even though he was concerned that it could add to the domestic unrest that has already popped up sporadically in several cities. Mr. Suharto recently warned his army to be prepared to quell disturbances.
The I.M.F. also has to proceed with care. President Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia sharply criticized the fund today for imposing harsh austerity rules on Southeast Asian nations, while letting currency traders operate around the globe without regulation. He said his country would not seek assistance from the I.M.F., no matter how deep its woes.
"This way we will not be enslaved by anybody, otherwise we will return to colonialization," he said. Malaysia was once British Malaya, and Indonesia was a Dutch colony for 350 years until its independence in 1949.
American officials said that they would only agree to disperse funds from the "second line of defense" if Indonesia strictly followed the I.M.F.'s mandates and if the I.M.F. aid was not sufficient to stabilize the Indonesian markets.
And even then, they said, Indonesia could not draw on the money unless it had more currency reserves on hand than it was borrowing from the United States. Currently, those reserves total about $25 billion.
Washington is only one of several capitals offering to be part of that defensive line. Mr. Suharto declared earlier this week that Singapore, which is heavily dependent on trade with Indonesia, was offering $10 billion, though it is unclear under what conditions. Japan is also expected to offer some backup financing, along with Australia and Malaysia.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE MAYOR;
The Morning After a Contentious Debate, Giuliani Focuses Singularly on His Record

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
A day after the hand-to-hand combat of the campaign's final debate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani once again adopted a strategy of extolling his own record and barely acknowledging Ruth W. Messinger yesterday, going so far as to refer to her not by name but merely as "a candidate."
Mr. Giuliani went before a business group in the morning to describe what he said were his achievements in turning around New York City's economy and revamping its budget. Accompanied by charts and ignoring his prepared text, he reprised for his sympathetic audience a list of his re-election campaign's greatest hits: cutting taxes, reducing the growth in city spending, helping to create 173,500 private-sector jobs, scaling back the municipal work force and trimming the welfare rolls. 
 "We changed the atmosphere of the city," Mr. Giuliani said in his speech before the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce. "This city is no longer seen -- city government is no longer seen -- as being antibusiness."
He contended that when he entered office, the local economy was out of balance, with an unwieldy city government levying so many taxes and imposing so many regulations that businesses were stifled. He conceded that the city had not recovered all the jobs that it had lost in the recession, but he did not dwell upon other problems in the city's budget that independent monitors have cited, including large projected gaps in the coming years and heavy long-term debt. The city spends nearly 20 percent of its tax revenues on principal and interest from its borrowing.
The Mayor was introduced by Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, who was a staunch supporter until the two feuded last year over Mr. Giuliani's effort to get Time Warner's cable division to transmit Rupert Murdoch's 24-hour news channel in the city. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parsons hugged awkwardly, and there appeared to be little warmth between the two.
Mr. Giuliani later said that he would embark on a campaign tour across the city on Sunday, visiting as many neighborhoods as he could before Election Day. Mr. Giuliani also told reporters that he had decisively won the debate on Wednesday night with Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan borough president, whom he called "the opposition."
In his speech to the business group, the Mayor said: "Antibusiness politics was at the core of the way politics was practiced in New York City, from at least the late 1930's, right through 1993. You ran for office running against big business. You ran for office running against all the bad, terrible corporations. I even hear a candidate who says that now. I don't hear her right now, but I heard it a lot last night."
He then growled, as if mocking Ms. Messinger's repeated attacks on his record in the debate, and broke off into a chuckle.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE RISKS;
Bank Stocks Fall On Fears About Overseas Losses

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Bank stocks plunged yesterday on fears about big banks' exposure to hair-raising drops in overseas markets, especially in Latin America. But traders and bankers say the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the nation's largest bank, may be facing significant losses, at least on paper, in a currently less-noticed part of the world -- Russia.
Bank stocks have been under pressure recently as investors' fears have mounted about the banks' exposure to weaknesses in the economies of Asian, Latin American and Eastern European countries. Many of the biggest United States banks are active traders in the currencies and securities issued in those countries and for many years enjoyed robust returns. But since the financial crisis began in Southeast Asia this summer, all emerging markets have been whipsawed. 
 Most banks have declined to discuss how well they are faring in those markets, particularly Brazil, where stocks fell 9.8 percent yesterday. And holders of Brady bonds issued by Brazil have seen the value of their holdings drop by about 17 percent since the middle of last week. Brady bonds are foreign debt whose principal is backed by United States Treasury bonds.
Many large banks with exposure to Latin America and other emerging markets helped lead the stock market lower yesterday. BankBoston Corporation's shares dropped 5.6 percent; BankAmerica Corporation fell 4.5 percent; Citicorp and J. P. Morgan both fell 3.4 percent. Chase's shares plummeted $4.50 yesterday, to $115.75, a drop of 3.7 percent.
The broad drop in bank stocks shows that Chase is not alone.
Still, traders and bankers say Chase has been badly burned in the last week trading the Russian equivalent of Treasury bills, known as GKO's, atop even larger paper losses from Latin American securities. It is not known exactly how big the combined losses are or whether they will be material to a bank that last year reported $2.5 billion in net profits. But the setback illustrates the financial dangers facing companies that trade in the unpredictable and often perilous world of emerging markets.
A Chase spokesman said it was company policy not to comment on any of the bank's market activities.
Donald Layton, Chase vice chairman for global markets, said the bank was comfortable with its financial position in emerging markets.
"We're one of the leading players in emerging market debt," Mr. Layton said. "We're used to the ups, and we're used to the downs."
Mr. Layton said also that the recent economic meltdown in Southeast Asia "created and kicked off a financial markets episode which to a large degree has taken on a life of its own, which is not directly related to economic fundamentals outside of Southeast Asia."
Banks technically do not realize losses in their trading portfolios until securities are actually sold. Until then, any market downturns are only reflected in a bank's daily trading ledger, not in its publicly reported bottom line. So a turnaround in the emerging markets by the end of the fourth quarter could erase any paper losses the banks now have.
Nonetheless, an individual close to Chase's trading operation said that the bank has been badly hurt "in the emerging markets and, despite having very robust foreign exchange gains, it won't balance out" by the end of the quarter.
This person said that Chase has suffered paper losses in Russia "in the tens of millions" of dollars in addition to much larger losses in Latin America.
Chase and Credit Suisse First Boston, an investment firm, are considered to be two of the largest concerns specializing in Russian securities. Credit Suisse said it had not booked any recent losses related to Russia, nor does it have paper losses there because it had effectively hedged all of its positions.
The Russian stock market has tripled in the last 18 months. But by this week, shares had fallen about 40 percent from their August highs. The price of GKO's -- dubbed gekkos in Wall Street parlance -- has plummeted in the last two weeks, though they are so thinly traded that quotes were hard to come by yesterday.
A Citicorp spokesman said the bank had "nothing in particular to report" regarding its exposure to emerging markets.
Indeed, analysts said some of the concern about banks' problems in emerging markets is overblown. "I haven't heard of anything that would make me think anything odd and unusual is going on in Brazil," said Diane B. Glossman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
"All broker dealers have taken hits in particular countries over the last week," said Peter Allen, head of emerging markets research for BankBoston, which has a large banking operation in Brazil. "I'm sure a lot of banks have taken hits in Brazil, maybe in Argentina, too."
Trading in emerging market securities has been so feverish in the last few days that trading volume on Wednesday overwhelmed many broker-dealers that make markets in such instruments. Eurobrokers, one of the biggest firms processing emerging market debt trades for banks, closed early on Wednesday. And many other broker-dealers closed about half an hour early on the advice of the Emerging Markets Trading Association, an industry trade group. "Traders have been getting in at 5 A.M. over the last couple of days, and we thought we would give everybody a half-an-hour breather," said Mike Chamberlin, the group's executive director.
Trades were apparently processed more smoothly yesterday.
But banks are still casting a wary eye on Latin America. "The temperature is fragile," said the head of emerging markets at a major money center bank who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "People will see how Brazil pans out. We're still concerned about Asia. Russia is a smaller part of the story."

HEADLINE: M.J. Latsis, 70, Emma Lathen Writing Team Collaborator

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Mary Jane Latsis, who helped make business the backdrop for murder as one half of the Emma Lathen writing team that produced two dozen John Putnam Thatcher mysteries, died on Monday at a hospital in Plymouth, N.H. She was 70 and maintained residences in Warren, N.H., and Brookline, Mass.
Her collaborator, Martha Henissart, said the cause was a heart attack and a stroke. 
 When the urbane New York banker John Putnam Thatcher made his first appearance on the mystery scene, in a 1961 book named "Banking on Death," it raised eyebrows in two cultures.
For one thing, Thatcher, the executive vice president and head of the trust department of Sloan Guaranty Trust, the world's third largest commercial bank, was the first fictional sleuth to spring from the world of business and finance, and he became an immediate hit on Wall Street.
For another, in a genre in which pseudonyms are common enough, nobody knew who Emma Lathen was, or even suspected that she was two shes, one a 34-year-old Harvard trained economist (Latsis) and the other a 32-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer (Henissart).
It was years before the trade tumbled to their secret, and years more before the writers would agree to be identified in interviews, to avoid embarrassing Miss Henissart's clients.
By the time the two women met as Harvard graduate students in 1952 and discovered a shared addiction to murder mysteries, Miss Latsis, a native of Chicago, had graduated from Wellesley, worked for a while for the Central Intelligence Agency and spent two years in Rome working for the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization.
At first they were merely friends and roommates who swapped mysteries and introduced each other to favorite authors before going their separate ways, Miss Latsis to teach economics at Wellesley, Miss Henissart to practice law in New York.
Then in 1960, Miss Henissart took a corporate legal position in Boston. While staying with Miss Latsis during a house hunt, she asked what good mysteries were around and was told there were not any.
"Then let's write one," said either Miss Latsis or Miss Henissart, who insists that neither woman had ever been able to recall which of them had uttered the magic words.
Almost immediately they began working out the details of an unconventional collaboration in which they would first agree on the basic structure and major characters, then write and exchange alternating chapters. Miss Latsis, composing in pen on yellow legal pads while sitting in a chair, always produced the first one, and Miss Henissart, using a manual typewriter, the last.
They would then get together for a final joint rewrite, ironing out inconsistencies and gradually synthesizing a distinctive composite style.
The collaboration was rocky at first, especially after Miss Latsis killed off one of Miss Henissart's favorite characters, but they soon found common ground and enough success to quit their jobs.
Although their books, which have sold hundreds of thousands of copies, have been praised for their wit and insights, what set them apart was the authentic, often intricate business deals that produced both the murders and the clues their banker hero used to solve them.
Under the name R.B. Dominic, they created another offbeat fictional detective, an Ohio congressman, but he was never as popular as the redoubtable John Putnam Thatcher. They abandoned the series after seven books.
They generally produced a book every year or so, but once, when Miss Latsis, the daughter of Greek immigrants, became agitated over the 1967 Greek colonel's coup, they interrupted the project they were working on and turned out "When In Greece" in six weeks.
Their latest book, "A Shark Out Of Water," is being published by St. Martin's Press this month, and another manuscript, using the Persian Gulf war as a backdrop, is about 80 percent complete. Miss Henissart said she planned to finish it, but did not know if John Putnam Thatcher would continue after that.
With their success, the women, two slender brunettes often taken as sisters, bought a house together in Warren and spent part of each year there, working and talking over plots during long hikes through the White Mountains, their collaborative solitude broken only by Miss Henissart's succession of suitors and Miss Latsis's ever faithful Walter Frank.
Mr. Frank, a Cambridge investment executive, was not the model for John Putnam Thatcher, but over the years he displayed a certain gallantry.
In a concession to an old-fashioned sense of propriety and Miss Latsis's aversion to marriage, she and Mr. Frank maintained a 40-year romance while maintaining separate residences.
He is her only survivor.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE VOTERS;
New Jersey Poll Finds Volatility Among Voters

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman continues to receive high marks as Governor of New Jersey, but she has been unable to convince voters that she would do a better job than her Democratic opponent, State Senator James E. McGreevey, in addressing their top concern, auto insurance, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Although those polled said they had more confidence in Mr. McGreevey's ability to lower auto insurance rates, 60 percent were unable to offer an opinion of him. Four years ago, a poll found Mrs. Whitman in a comparable position, with 46 percent saying they could offer no opinion of her. 
 With voters expressing such mixed sentiments -- and one in three saying they could change their minds before Tuesday -- the survey's findings underscored the volatility of New Jersey voters. Moreover, the poll found a significant variation in the support for each candidate, depending on how likely they were to vote on Election Day.
The race between Mrs. Whitman and Mr. McGreevey appeared to be a statistical dead heat among those voters judged by pollsters to be the most likely to vote, based on their voting history and their stated intentions. They represented 15 percent of the total registered voters in the poll.
In this group, the poll showed that 43 percent preferred Mrs. Whitman, while 39 percent said they favored Mr. McGreevey. Murray Sabrin, the Libertarian gubernatorial nominee, received 9 percent of support from this group, and 8 percent said they were undecided. This group had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 7 percentage points.
Mrs. Whitman's lead widened among a broader group of voters who were not as sure that they would vote next week. Forty-four percent of this group said they would support Mrs. Whitman, while 34 percent said they would vote for Mr. McGreevey. In this group, Mr. Sabrin was preferred by 8 percent and 13 percent were undecided.
Mrs. Whitman's biggest lead was among all registered voters surveyed. She led Mr. McGreevey 44 percent to 33 percent, while 8 percent said they preferred Mr. Sabrin and 12 percent said they were undecided. The findings are similar to lastmonth's Times/CBS News poll, in which 44 percent of registered voters said they preferred Mrs. Whitman compared with 35 percent who said that they preferred Mr. McGreevey.
Despite a strong economy, Mrs. Whitman finds herself locked in a close race because voters do not think that she has done enough during her first term to bring down the cost of auto insurance and property taxes, the highest in the nation.
Mrs. Whitman appears to need a large turnout among Republicans and independent voters. Turnout also seems to be crucial for Mr. McGreevey. But his first challenge over the next few days is to solidify his Democratic base and sway undecided voters who, experts say, historically tend to choose the challenger over the incumbent.
In the poll, Mr. McGreevey had the support of only 56 percent of those surveyed who described themselves as Democrats, giving him an opportunity to narrow Mrs. Whitman's lead by making a strong appeal to rally the Democratic Party.
Mrs. Whitman made inroads among those who described themselves as Democrats, winning 26 percent of their support, while Mr. Sabrin captured 6 percent from this group. Twelve percent of the Democrats said they were undecided. The Governor needs to draw support from both Democrats and independent voters because, the poll found, she had the support of only 7 of 10 self-described Republicans. Thirteen percent said they were supporting McGreevey and 7 percent said they were supporting Mr. Sabrin.
For those voters who described themselves as independents, Mrs. Whitman won the support of 36 percent; Mr. McGreevey, 29 percent, and Mr. Sabrin, 12 percent; 20 percent said they were undecided.
"It is still extremely close," said David P. Rebovich, a professor of political science at Rider University in Lawrenceville. "Democrats should not be especially discouraged. It is close enough and there are enough undecided voters out there for the McGreevey camp to attract. Late deciders usually break for the challenger, so there is some encouragement there."
The statewide poll, conducted Saturday through Wednesday, was based on interviews with 1,392 adults. Of these, 1,082 said they were registered to vote. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, which means that statistically, each candidate's support at the time of polling could have been three points higher or three points lower than measured in the poll.
There were signs that the race was tightening during the week. Interviews that were begun Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday produced a somewhat smaller gap between Mrs. Whitman and Mr. McGreevey among registered voters than those conducted over last weekend.
"This is going to be a close race," said Tom Wilson, manager for Mrs. Whitman's re-election campaign. "This is the way that New Jersey behaves. You have a large amount of people who make sure that the candidates are listening to them."
But the McGreevey campaign was encouraged by the poll's finding that their steady barrage of criticism of Mrs. Whitman's handling of auto insurance was resonating with voters. And even though Mr. McGreevey may not be as well known as he hoped to be at this stage in the campaign, his advisers noted that most New Jersey voters traditionally do not begin to focus on statewide elections until just before Election Day.
"The voters know enough about Jim McGreevey to realize his commitment to reducing auto insurance rates, stabilizing property taxes and enhancing educational standards," said Richard McGrath, a spokesman for the McGreevey campaign.
The poll found that 54 percent of those surveyed approved of the way Mrs. Whitman was handling her job as governor, while 35 percent disapproved. Mrs. Whitman was also given high marks for her handling of the state's economy and environment.
But 76 percent of those polled said that they disapproved of the way that she had addressed the state's high auto insurance rates. And 63 percent said that they disapproved of the way she has handled property taxes.
Forty percent said they thought that Mr. McGreevey would be more likely than Mrs. Whitman to bring down the cost of auto insurance. Twenty-seven percent cited Mrs. Whitman and 18 percent said that neither candidate would reduce rates. When asked whether their opinions on auto insurance would influence their choice for governor, 26 percent said a great deal, 41 percent said somewhat, 19 percent said not much and 11 percent said not at all.
On the issue of property taxes, 50 percent said that they believed the taxes would increase in a second Whitman term, while 36 percent said the taxes would stay the same. Eight percent said they would decrease.
If Mr. McGreevey wins the election, property taxes will rise, 34 percent said in the poll. Another 34 percent said they would stay the same. Ten percent said they would fall and 17 percent said they did not know.
In the poll, 70 percent said that the tax cuts enacted during Governor Whitman's first term had made no difference to them personally, up from 66 percent in last month's poll.
The poll also showed that Mr. Sabrin, the first third-party candidate to qualify for public financing under the state program that provides matching taxpayer dollars to candidates, was pulling votes equally from Mrs. Whitman and Mr. McGreevey.
Most voters said they had seen at least one television commercial from the two major party candidates, but only 35 percent said that they saw or heard any of the three televised debates last week.
 
How the New Jersey Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Saturday through Wednesday with 1,392 adult residents of New Jersey. Of these, 1,082 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of New Jersey exchanges. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each area of the state was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey, thus allowing access to all adult household members.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, and age.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New Jersey.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.
Registered voters in the poll were classified as likely voters or most likely voters based on their answers to five questions dealing with past turnout, intention to vote this year, attention to the campaign and degree of mobility.

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CANDIDATES;
Campaigns Look for a Prop: Vice Presidents Are Willing

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN, N.J., Oct. 30

 BODY:
With lingering concern that the more conservative base of her party had not shown enough enthusiasm for her re-election bid, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman spent much of her time today in Republican-dominated regions of the state, trying to excite a wing of her party that has complained about her pro-choice stand on abortion and her fiscal policies.
To bolster her conservative credentials, Mrs. Whitman was joined by the former Vice President, Dan Quayle, who took to the stage in the town green here and wasted little time proclaiming why he was with the Governor. "I am here today as a conservative Republican enthusiastically saying we're going to re-elect Christie Whitman as Governor," Mr. Quayle said. 
 It was unofficially Vice Presidents' day in New Jersey, as Mrs. Whitman's Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey, was joined by Vice President Al Gore, who traveled to the Camden County town of Pennsauken this morning to laud the county's $3 million program to provide at least one computer for each of the county's 5,800 classrooms by the year 2000.
The appearance with Mr. Gore at Pennsauken High School was the highlight of the day for Mr. McGreevey, who was praised by the Vice President for his pledge to enhance educational standards in the state. For Mr. McGreevey, Mayor of Woodbridge and a state senator, the event generated valuable news coverage and provided a forum for him to repeat his promise to abolish the curriculum standards that the Whitman administration adopted earlier this year and replace them with what he says will be tougher standards.
He told 2,000 students in the school's gymnasium that New Jersey's standards were the weakest and lowest in the country. "If I'm elected Governor, you're going to be working so much harder," Mr. McGreevey said, drawing jittery murmurs and muted clapping. "I want you to be able to achieve your fullest potential."
Later in the day, Mr. McGreevey campaigned in his home county, Middlesex, where he greeted workers at the 4 P.M. shift change at the Ford production plant in Edison. Mr. McGreevey, who has received endorsements from most major labor groups, was joined by John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Mrs. Whitman spent the morning in Orange at the funeral of Scott M. Gonzalez, the state trooper killed last week in the line of duty. But by the afternoon, she had also made an academic visit, as she and Mr. Quayle talked with students at Randolph High School, one of the state's top schools, tucked in the woodsy suburbs of Morris County.
After the Governor delivered a message about personal responsibility to the students, she and her husband, John, and Mr. Quayle, hanging out the window of her campaign bus, tossed foam flying-discs emblazoned with her 10-day bus tour theme, "On the Road to a Brighter Future."
But there was one student -- far, far away -- who caused the most emotional moment of the day. At the Parsippany offices of Dialogic Corporation, a manufacturer of computer telecommunications components, Mrs. Whitman had just finished delivering her stump speech about job creation and the economy to 300 employees, when company officials told her they had a surprise for her.
With the flick of a switch, the voice of the Governor's 20-year-old daughter, Kate, came over a loudspeaker -- live from South Africa, where she is currently studying. "Hi, Mom," the voice said. The Governor began to cry. At that point, Mr. Whitman stepped on the stage, and spoke into the microphone to his daughter. "They're telling me this call isn't costing us," he joked. "You can talk as much as you want," Mrs. Whitman added.
Before they ended the call, Mrs. Whitman asked her daughter, a junior at Wesleyan University who is spending the semester in Cape Town, "Did you get your ballot in?"
At one point during the day, Mrs. Whitman's bus pulled into a shopping center parking lot, and with news media trailing behind, she went into a Kmart store to buy cold medicine and vitamins. As she greeted shoppers, one man asked her about the criticism of her in advertisements for the Libertarian Party candidate, Murray Sabrin. "They're just totally untrue," Mrs. Whitman said of the ads. The man said that the explanation was good enough for him, and that he would vote for the Governor.
But convincing people like Pat Sheils of Morristown is not as easy. A devoted Republican and staunch opponent of abortion, she stood and watched the Governor and Mr. Quayle deliver their speeches here in her hometown and then confided that she plans to vote for Mr. Sabrin. "New Jersey is the partial-birth abortion capital," Ms. Sheils said. "I don't want her as Governor. She is a Clinton Republican."

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE CHALLENGER;
Touring 3 Boroughs, Messinger Focuses on Education

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Just five days before next Tuesday's mayoral election, Ruth W. Messinger worked the Bronx yesterday, trying to energize voters in the only borough where polls show her to have a consistent edge over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
There and at other stops in Manhattan and Queens, she focused her message on education issues, including her desire to cap tuition for City University students and her support of the state's proposed $2.4 billion School Bond Act. 
 While Ms. Messinger sought to keep her campaign day focused on education, she found herself denying assertions that she once supported the use of one-officer patrol cars for the New York Police Department.
Both campaigns issued competing news releases yesterday on the patrol car issue, raised in the mayoral debate Wednesday night. In fact, both Mr. Giuliani, as Mayor, and Ms. Messinger, as Manhattan Borough President, have said at different times in recent years that the Police Department should consider experimenting with patrol cars operated by one officer under certain conditions. Neither candidate, however, expressed support for adopting such a policy.
Ms. Messinger began her day at 7:30 A.M. at the subway station at East 177th Street in the Parkchester section of the Bronx. She returned to the Bronx yesterday afternoon for a rally at Hostos Community College, where Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, joined her on stage and the students applauded the parts of her speech that were delivered in Spanish.
"Necesito su apoyo, su ayuda y sus votas," Ms. Messinger told more than 300 cheering students in Hostos's repertory theater, asking for their support, their help and their votes. "You got it," one student shouted back in English. Another screamed, "Go Ruth! Go Ruth!"
Later in the morning, after she testified before the State Assembly's Committee on Higher Education about reducing tuition at the city's community colleges, she was asked why there seemed to be fewer reporters covering her campaign day.
"I believe that the press in this city owes it to the people of this city to cover all of the issues that I have been talking about in the campaign," she said. "The question is whether the people of this city know enough about a persistently high unemployment rate, about the dreadful, dilapidated and deteriorated condition of some of our schools, and I think they do not."
After she made her pitch for $2.4 billion School Bond Act at Public School 199 in Sunnyside, Queens, her private meeting with parents attracted about two dozen people.
Last night, Ms. Messinger attended a rally with female supporters at the West Park Presbyterian Church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
"I think that the city is ready for one tough mother," Ms. Messinger said. "You have five days left to win this election."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON: IN CHINA;
At Home, Rosy News for Jiang's Trip

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Among the mandatory smiles and pageantry of Jiang Zemin's state visit to Washington this week, the impromptu debate on human rights between Mr. Jiang and President Clinton at their news conference Wednesday stood out as unusually frank. For American viewers at least, it was a reminder of the differences that remain despite a multitude of agreements and shared hopes.
But few Chinese are apt to learn about this telling moment because the pointed exchange was not mentioned at all in the news coverage here. All week the Government-controlled television and newspapers have extolled the happy moments of the trip and glossed over less pleasant tidings. 
 Viewers this evening of China's only national television newscast watched the Clintons and Gores meet Mr. Jiang and his wife, sat through nearly the entire American national anthem and watched the 21-gun salute. They heard a long summary of the leaders' joint statement, covering everything from environmental agreements to the desire for world peace.
The news conference itself was shown only briefly, and the crowd of protesters across the street from the White House was not mentioned at all. From the long and lively press conference, the Government-run China Central Television showed only a moment of each leader's statement about constructive cooperation, and a Chinese reporter lobbing Mr. Jiang a softball of a question.
The television networks and newspapers here -- all Government controlled -- have been remarkably consistent. The images given the Chinese people have been resolutely upbeat, with special emphasis on the pomp and symbols. The newspapers have sometimes mentioned, amid the long lists of achievements, that the two countries have differences on human rights, but then report only Mr. Jiang's justifications.
Mr. Jiang clearly wanted this trip to give him new stature as a leader, and China new stature as a world player. Each day's ceremonies have been featured atop page one of every major newspaper, crowding down news about the stock market chaos in Hong Kong, and they have filled the opening minutes of every news broadcast.
"The goverment sees this visit as a very big event, and they give the media very detailed directions about what to print," said Wu Guoguang, a former editorial writer of the People's Daily who left China in 1989 and now teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Longtime China-watchers in the diplomatic community here are not surprised by the timid and uniform press coverage, a habit of Communism that has not waned in the new era of economic opening. The Chinese leaders need time to mull over the results of this American visit, said a Western diplomat, and in the meantime would find it risky to allow attention for anything so heated as Wednesday's Presidential retorts.
The trip has produced one mystery. Mr. Jiang's hourlong swim in Hawaii, a feat of stamina by any measure, would seem designed to impress the Chinese people and harked back to famous swims by Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping. Yet while the Western and the Hong Kong press gave wide coverage to the event, someone high in the Chinese government apparently decided that this would not strike the right tone at home: Chinese television and newspapers ignored it.
A possible answer was suggested by Mr. Wu, the former People's Daily editor. He recalled that several years ago Li Peng, the Prime Minister, took a swim in the Dead Sea during a visit to the Middle East. The publication of a picture of him lolling in the water coincided, unfortunately, with a period of disastrous flooding in southern China, and Mr. Li's public image took a dive.
"Maybe the papers learned a lesson from that," Mr. Wu said.

U.S. Commits $3 Billion To Indonesia Aid Package
The United States will announce today that it is committing roughly $3 billion in backup financing for an International Monetary Fund package to aid Indonesia. 
Though the I.M.F. is taking the lead, the commitment is clearly intended to send the message that the United States has decided that the risks to worldwide markets have grown intense enough that it must show a willingness to intervene in Southeast Asia, where the troubles began. Page A1.
 
Wellpoint Stock Falls Sharply
The downturn in the stocks of managed-care companies spread to Wellpoint Health Networks, whose shares fell 13 percent even though the company reported relatively strong quarterly financial results. D2.
 
Worldcom Shares Below Key Level
Worldcom, whose unsolicited bid for MCI Communications depends in part on the value of Worldcom stock, announced quarterly results that exceeded expectations, but they failed to lift the company's shares above a price it had set to help determine the value of its MCI bid. D10.
 
The original bidder for MCI -- British Telecommunications, which is now in complex negotiations with the other suitors, GTE and Worldcom -- insisted that it still wanted a partnership with MCI. It, too, announced operating earnings that exceeded expectations, though the bottom line was affected by one-time costs. D10.
 
$875 Million Bid in Long Distance
ACC, a provider of local and long-distance telephone service, said it had received an unsolicited $875 million offer from Tel-Save Holdings, a long-distance company. D10.

Signs of Economic Vibrance
The Government said new-home sales fell slightly but remained strong in September, and applications for unemployment insurance slid last week. The reports suggest that the economy had considerable stamina before the stock market's gyrations this week. D2.
 
Treasuries Ascend Again
Treasury bonds continued to gain from the uncertainty in the stock market and the diminished fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.14 percent from 6.20 percent. D20.
 
The dollar was dragged lower by the drop in stocks, adding to a weeklong slump against the Swiss franc and the German mark while turning lower against the Japanese yen, against which the dollar had risen. D17.

The price of gold, a traditional safe haven for investors -- rose sharply, buoyed by uncertainty over the Asian financial crisis and fears that tensions between the United States and Iraq would escalate. D17.
 
Sony in Black
Earnings at Sony rose sharply, helped by rising demand for digital electronic products and the success of the Will Smith film "Men in Black," which helped the company fix its sights on a box-office revival for its Hollywood studios. D4.
 
Pharmacia Earnings Decline
Pharmacia & Upjohn said quarterly net income fell 20 percent as its older drugs faced strong competition and exchange-rate fluctuations ate into sales. D10.

A New Approach for Fila
Fila is refocusing its sales pitches centered on Grant Hill, the basketball star. An extensive campaign by Arnell Group Brand Consulting, to introduce the fourth version of the shoe named after him, seeks to concentrate more on the performance aspects of the product than its fashionability.

HEADLINE: Pen in Hand, Raul Salinas Denies Murder and Theft

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON and PETER TRUELL 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 27

 BODY:
When his brother was President of Mexico, Raul Salinas de Gortari lived the high life, enjoying the thoroughbred horses, fast cars and luxurious houses readily available to someone who could deposit more than $100 million in Swiss bank accounts.
Now, after spending much of the last three years in a cramped, frigid cell in Mexico's harshest prison, Mr. Salinas says that he amassed his fortune legitimately, but acknowledges that he did it by seizing the "huge opportunities" for business deals afforded a sibling of Mexico's leader. 
 In his first extensive interview with a foreign publication since he was jailed in February, 1995, on suspicion of murder, Mr. Salinas vigorously denied the homicide charges as well as allegations that he was paid by Mexico's drug barons to protect their multi-billion dollar enterprises. He also provided new details of how two American financial institutions, Citibank and Bankers Trust, handled his money.
Mexican authorities do not allow Mr. Salinas to meet directly with reporters. And so one day last week, the man who has become a symbol to many Mexicans of the venal abuse of political power sat down with a ballpoint pen and white pad of paper -- the only writing materials he is allowed. He responded with 10 pages of replies to written questions from The New York Times, answering in occasionally awkward English that his lawyer later corrected.
"I always have had private business, and when you are the brother of the President of Mexico, many huge opportunities come to you, as happened to me," wrote Mr. Salinas, the eldest brother of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whose term in office ended in late 1994. "There was no need for me, with the position I had, to get involved with drug dealers."
One such opportunity, he said, arose in 1993 when the Mexican Government sold a leading television network to private investors for $641 million. Raul Salinas confirmed that he loaned the lead investor $30 million around the time of the sale because he was certain he would make a profit and it would be "a good one." The interview was arranged by Stanley Arkin, Mr. Salinas's New York-based lawyer. Mr. Arkin also set up several hours of conversations with members of Mr. Salinas's immediate family who live in Mexico, including his father and three of his siblings.
The siblings -- Adriana, who is 47 and runs a publishing company; Enrique, 44, a civil engineer; and Sergio, a 43-year-old sociologist -- criticized their brother Raul for making "stupid mistakes" and misusing privileges that came to him as a result of his brother's Presidency.
But they adamantly denied that anyone in the Salinas family had any role in drug trafficking or theft of government money.
Defending Raul Salinas and protesting his imprisonment, the Salinas clan gathered in the wood-paneled library overlooking a garden at the elegant Mexico City home they have occupied for 45 years. They charged that overzealous authorities have demonized Raul and the rest of the family of the former President, who is widely blamed for a severe economic crisis that erupted just after he left office.
"When a wounded animal falls, the hyenas close in to finish it off," said Adriana Salinas. "The authorities are trying to finish us off from every side by attempting to show that we are thieves, drug-traffickers and amoral people."
Mr. Salinas's relatives said they were stunned to learn of the huge balances in his Swiss accounts and they called Raul Salinas's use of false documents and other financial subterfuges "indefensible."
"Raul was in a very influential position in my brother's administration in which he had many business opportunities," said Enrique Salinas, his brother. "We know that this is a common situation for someone who is in the President's family, but we feel that Raul overdid it. He was a show-off. He abused his possibilities."
"But we know, we are absolutely sure, that he is not guilty of drugs or taking money from the Government," Enrique Salinas said.
Former President Carlos Salinas, whose reputation was wrecked by his brother Raul's scandals, is living in forced exile in Dublin, Ireland, although he has not been charged with any crime in Mexico. He did not participate in the interviews.
Since 1995, Raul Salinas has been held without bond on murder charges at the Almoloya prison near Mexico City, a maximum security prison designed for dangerous convicted felons which, he noted pensively, was built on orders from his brother Carlos. Raul Salinas's visits from relatives and defense lawyers are limited and closely monitored by prison guards.
Disclosures two years ago that American banks helped Raul Salinas move more than $100 million to Swiss accounts touched off investigations in Mexico, Switzerland and the United States that are still unfolding.
Swiss investigators have said they believe the deposits resulted from drug payoffs, but have yet to present evidence publicly to support that assertion. In the United States, officials have been examining Citibank's handling of the money and why the bank accepted such large deposits from Mr. Salinas, a former bureaucrat who earned a modest salary for much of his career. No charges have been brought by either country.
The Swiss have interviewed several witnesses in the United States who link Raul Salinas to drug trafficking, but the Salinas family says there is no hard evidence to support those allegations. Under Swiss banking law, the Government can keep any money shown to be drug-tainted.
"My money in Switzerland is honest money, and by this time they should know it," Mr. Salinas wrote. "I have never taken a peso from a public budget or a drug dealer and I believe the charges against me are false and will be defeated."
He said, as he has in the past, that most of the money deposited in Switzerland was put up by private Mexican investors for an investment fund that he planned to begin using to finance international trade projects in Mexico after his brother's term was over.
"I was in charge of finding good investment opportunities and I was very well positioned for that," Mr. Salinas wrote, although he did not mention any specific project he was considering. "But my arrest on Feb. 28, 1995, stopped everything."
Mr. Salinas declined to specify how much of the money in the Swiss accounts belongs directly to him and exactly where he got it.
His comments left other questions unanswered. No contracts were signed to establish the fund, formalize the tranfers to Mr. Salinas or detail planned investments. The dollar transfers, made in the months just prior to a devastating peso devaluation in Mexico, passed through a web of off-shore front companies into Swiss accounts Mr. Salinas opened using a fake passport.
"They trusted me," Mr. Salinas said of his partners, in his only explanation for the secrecy and informality of the transactions.
One deal that did go forward, Mr. Salinas said, involved the Government's sale of a broadcast franchise which became TV Azteca, now Mexico's second largest television network. Mr. Salinas said he lent $30 million to Ricardo Salinas Pliego, an entrepreneur who is not a relative, just as the Mexican Government was awarding his group the sale.
"I was going to get the money back with a profit (a good one)," Raul Salinas wrote.
A spokesman for TV Azteca said today: "All the details on this subject are on the record. The loan is outstanding and the interest will be paid at maturity."
Mr. Salinas also described his relations with Amy G. Elliott, the Citibank vice-president who was his private banker beginning in 1992 and helped him to move tens of millions of dollars to Switzerland and set up companies in the Cayman Islands. Citibank, according to Mr. Salinas' account, looked him over carefully when it accepted him as a client.
The issue is an important one for the bank. American laws and regulations on money laundering require banks to make an effort to know both their customers and the source of their money.
"They were very strict," at first, Raul Salinas wrote of Citibank. "They asked a lot of questions about the origin of the money, they asked about my private businesses and public sector jobs; they visited my house, they met my family and some of my friends like Carlos Hank," the Mexican financier who introduced Mr. Salinas to Ms. Elliott.
But then things changed.
"After that," he said, "they didn't ask many questions. I trusted them and they trusted me."
Citibank said today through a spokesman, Richard Howe, that the bank continues to cooperate with investigators. "We constantly watch for possible violation of the laws by the bank or its employees, and in this case, we have found no reason to believe there have been any," Mr. Howe said. He added that Ms. Elliott remains a vice president "in good standing."
Mr. Salinas also described another important relationship with a New York bank: Bankers Trust New York Corporation, where he said he also had a personal banker whose name he could not remember. One account that Mr. Salinas held at the Zurich branch of Bankers Trust with his wife, Paulina Castanon, carried the title "Bonaparte" and held $10 million in April 1994, according to bank records provided by one of Mr. Salinas's business associates.
The Mexican Government's investigation of Raul Salinas for the 1994 murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a former state governor who had once been Adriana Salinas's husband, has been plagued with irregularities.
The former chief prosecutor on the case is now in jail, charged with conspiring to frame Mr. Salinas. Yet the Government is pressing forward and has refused to move Mr. Salinas to a less restrictive prison.
Mr. Arkin, Raul Salinas's lawyer, said that much of the testimony in the American investigations appeared to come from convicted drug criminals "who had an extraordinary interest" in helping themselves by accusing Mr. Salinas.
Mr. Arkin said, "I'd hope my government takes a very careful and sober look at what may very well be the same sort of fabrications that are taking place in Mexico in the homicide case."
The family patriarch, Raul Salinas Lozano, who is 80, spoke affectionately of Raul, Jr. as "a very, very good son." But he claimed he never talked business with him.
"I never thought he had money," Mr. Salinas Lozano said.
After the family's turmoil, Mr. Salinas Lozano said he was offering one piece of advice to his grandchildren:
"I ask them, 'Please don't go into politics.' "

HEADLINE: THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE RECORD;
Messinger Has Moved Right, But Not Sufficiently for Some

SERIES: RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Challenger's Record

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
Talk to the people best acquainted with Ruth W. Messinger's industrious tenure as a New York City Councilwoman and a myriad of issues get mentioned, from child welfare to campaign finance reform, American intervention in Nicaragua to gay rights. As the Council's resident firebrand from 1978 through 1989, Ms. Messinger was as rarely at a loss for causes as she was for words.
But the initiative that many of her colleagues remember best, invoking it alternately as an example of her grit and an emblem of her recklessness, is commercial rent control. 
 Commercial rent control has always been a controversial idea, deemed by many politicians to be too meddlesome in the economy, too perilous to investment and growth. But in the boom years of the 1980's, when merchants in Manhattan saw rents practically quadruple overnight, Ms. Messinger was a leading voice for some kind of regulation, pressing for binding arbitration between landlords and tenants who faced increases above a certain amount.
Ultimately, she failed. But along the way, she succeeded in defining and distilling her political identity as a champion of underdogs more dogged than most others, a true believer in the aggressive ministrations of government and a populist ready to challenge the corporate interests that other politicians were more reluctant to estrange.
These are traits that emerge repeatedly in an examination of Ms. Messinger's two-decade political career, which embraces not only her 12 years as a Councilwoman but her eight years as Manhattan Borough President, the elected office she has held since 1990.
Ms. Messinger is now running for mayor as the Democratic nominee, and while supporters look to her past and see evidence that she would institute a more compassionate city government, detractors see proof positive that she would usher in a less restrained and sensible one.
"She'd clearly be better on social issues," said City Councilman Stanley E. Michels, a Manhattan Democrat and an old friend, comparing Ms. Messinger with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "I think she'd be much more sensitive to the underclass, to the less fortunate, to minorities."
But other politicians -- some Democrats as well as Republicans -- said that these proclivities, etched perhaps more clearly in her political record than in her current campaign, were too extreme.
"She represents a philosophy far to the left of what I believe is good for the city of New York," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a Democrat who sparred repeatedly with Ms. Messinger when he occupied Gracie Mansion and when she served, in his words, as "the intellectual leader of the left wing of the City Council." Mr. Koch said that he planned to cross party lines on Tuesday and vote for Mr. Giuliani, a man he personally dislikes.
In recent years, Ms. Messinger has tacked somewhat to the right, mellowing her rhetoric and -- perhaps most striking -- supporting the kinds of commercial and residential development she once opposed. She abandoned commercial rent control.
But the extent of her transformation is difficult to gauge. In her current campaign, Ms. Messinger has occasionally diverted attention from her past without making clear where she stands in the present on a broad range of issues.
Moreover, Ms. Messinger became Borough President just as the City Charter was being revised in ways that greatly diminished the post, and she has spent the better part of a decade in something of a political holding pattern.
When former Mayor David N. Dinkins, whom Ms. Messinger succeeded as Borough President, was asked repeatedly to pinpoint her accomplishments in that job, he talked vaguely about her priorities before finally conceding: "A borough president doesn't have any power."
 
On the Council
Leaning to the Left; Strong on Details
Ms. Messinger also had limited power on the Council. Representing the Upper West Side of Manhattan, she spoke for an unusually progressive district where her membership in the Democratic Socialists of America was a badge of honor, and she voted frequently in the Council's dissident minority.
Her influence on the Council, even by her own estimation, was often indirect, measured not so much in a long litany of legislation attributable to her as in the way she shaped debates. Colleagues said that Ms. Messinger did astonishingly thorough homework and came to discussions with reams of information and long lists of questions.
Ms. Messinger, a former social worker, demonstrated a consistent concern for the homeless and poor, battered children and bruised wives, victims of oppression and targets of bigotry. She fought against the displacement of residents of single-room occupancy hotels that were slated for gentrification, and her criticisms of the city's child welfare system helped trigger reforms.
But Ms. Messinger's specific remedies for social ills were not always the most widely accepted ones, at least at the time. For example, she was an early advocate of the distribution of condoms in schools. She was one of the most ardent proponents of a citywide gay rights bill, promoting it for eight years until it finally became law in 1986. The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who voted against it, said that Ms. Messinger deserved as much credit as anyone else for its passage.
But critics say that in her steadfast support for minority groups and what she assumed they wanted, Ms. Messinger sometimes pandered to them. For example, in 1985, she opposed the closing of gay bathhouses, a position that echoed some of the loudest gay advocates, but not all of them, and that ignored the advice of most public health officials seeking to curb the spread of AIDS. Ms. Messinger argued at the time that bathhouses, where men met for anonymous sex, were not a major threat in the spread of the disease.
On this issue and others, Ms. Messinger seemed resistant to any abridging of civil liberties. She abstained from a Council vote to make the sale or possession of drug paraphernalia a crime, citing worries that it would disproportionately punish minorities.
At the same time, however, she supported some legislation that would have involved local government in citizens' lives in new ways, such as an unsuccessful resolution requiring permits for bicycles.
 
Legislative Record
Campaign Finance, Taxes and Broccoli
One of the most persistent raps against Ms. Messinger was that she embraced too many issues, wasting her passion on matters peripheral to city government and beyond its control. She supported a broccoli boycott in solidarity with exploited agricultural workers, introduced a Council resolution condemning United States interference in Central America and sponsored another that called on Congress to reopen the investigation of the spy case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953.
All of this distracted from more substantive achievements.
"She was part of an awful lot of landmark bills," said Mr. Vallone, identifying Ms. Messinger as one of the principal architects and advocates of the city's first recycling law in 1989; of a 1988 act banning smoking in many public places, and of a 1988 campaign finance measure that, for candidates who want to receive public funds, put ceilings on the individual contributions they could accept and on the amount they could spend.
Ms. Messinger was also a driving force behind a 1984 law that protected government whistleblowers from repercussions.
But she perhaps garnered the most attention during her Council years for her frequent attacks on the hefty tax abatements that the Koch administration routinely granted developers and corporations to spur the construction or rehabilitation of residential and commercial buildings.
Her success in exposing these practices and pressuring the city to modify them made her a hero among many neighborhood groups and tenants but a villain among many landowners and landlords. And it earned her a reputation as an archenemy of development. But in an interview, Ms. Messinger said that she was merely exerting common sense. Tax abatements, she argued, "were much too consistently done with a broad brush, with no balance of questions about what kind of development was good for the city, what kind was problematic."
She said that on the residential front, the city was often bankrolling the evictions of low and middle-income tenants to make way for new luxury apartments. And on the commercial front, corporate America was doing so well and the New York real estate market was so hot that the city did not need to forfeit tax revenue to insure building.
Nor could it afford to, she said, because the city was emerging from a fiscal crisis and strapped for cash. As chairwoman of the Council's Committee on Revenue Enhancement, Ms. Messinger made city taxation policies an area of expertise. While she suggested cutting taxes on small businesses, she advocated increases in other taxes, including those on hotel rooms and alcohol.
These days, she talks less about raising new revenue than pruning existing spending, a change in emphasis that has surprised some longtime supporters.
"She never said she was for taxes," remembered Gale A. Brewer, Ms. Messinger's chief of staff on the Council, "but I didn't realize she was this against them."
 
Borough President
Moving to Center, Within New Limits
During Ms. Messinger's campaign for Manhattan borough president in 1989, she not only reaped the fruits of the campaign finance law she had helped enact, but met accusations from some fellow politicians that she was being a glutton.
Under the law, she qualified for $600,000 in public money, and she took and spent all of it, on top of the even larger amount she had raised on her own, even though she was running against token opposition. She said she used the public and private money to help educate voters about important issues, to build name recognition among voters, to help Mr. Dinkins' mayoral campaign and to lobby for City Charter revisions.
In 1992, Ms. Messinger surprised many political colleagues by endorsing the construction plans for Riverside South, the complex of buildings that Donald Trump is raising along the Hudson River.
Opponents of the project say that Ms. Messinger, in anticipation of her own mayoral campaign, was simply trying to shed an anti-business image. But Ms. Messinger said that the land Riverside South occupies was inevitably going to be developed and that Mr. Trump's proposal included such public perks as a waterfront park and money for renovating the subway station at West 72nd Street and Broadway.
"This looked to me like the best opportunity we were going to have," she said.
As for her more receptive attitude toward development in general, Ms. Messinger said that, as Borough President, she no longer speaks only for the Upper West Side, a rather thoroughly developed patch of concrete, and that the New York economy is not quite as sunny as it was in the mid-1980's.
"I'm representing an entire island with potential development sites at a time when it's clear the city needs some ongoing investment, some additional building and the jobs that that brings," Ms. Messinger said. "Time and venue have changed."
She acknowledged that she has changed, too, but only, she said, in some of the particular measures she advocates, not in her fundamental convictions. Of the limited money that the Manhattan Borough President's office controls -- between $15 million and $20 million annually -- Ms. Messinger has funneled more into the generally poorer portion of Manhattan above 96th Street than into the wealthier swath below.
 
Mixed Reviews
Despite Changes, Still a Crusader
Her willingness to tread into politically turbulent waters followed her to the Borough Presidency. Both Ms. Messinger and her appointee to the citywide Board of Education, Luis O. Reyes, supported the Rainbow Curriculum, which, among other suggestions, proposed lessons on tolerance of homosexuality for elementary school children.
And, as always, Ms. Messinger has not confined her crusades to matters of local governance. In 1992, she appeared at a concert in Manhattan called the Ban the Dam Jam to speak out against a hydroelectric project that would flood land in Quebec used by Cree Indians.
Her performance as Borough President draws mixed reviews from Manhattan's representatives on the City Council -- Democrats as well as the lone Republican -- and from leaders of community boards, most of whom say she has been good, but not great.
They praise the blueprint that her office developed for turning the Manhattan waterfront into a continuous esplanade. They also laud the research and planning assistance that her office has provided to overlooked sectors of Manhattan's economy, most notably the diamond district on West 47th Street.
But they say that her effectiveness has been undercut, particularly in the last four years, by the distraction of preparing to run for higher office.
"She made her office into an anti-Giuliani publicity machine," said City Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, a Republican who represents the Upper East Side. "Her annual budget documents and reviews have been nothing more than political manifestoes."
Ms. Messinger said that some of the real work done by a borough president is simply not visible to outsiders, and that she has been willing to use her extremely limited budget for projects that do not lead to fancy ribbon cuttings.
For example, she put up $1.8 million to remove asbestos at the Museum of Natural History and, she said, to dredge "the lead guck out of the plumbing." Ms. Messinger said that if the museum announces that it needs money for a gleaming new wing, "Lots of people want to do that. But they say the pipes are so corroded you can't turn on the water -- what donor cares?"
Ms. Messinger has always made it a point to care, even when she was one of the only ones.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
Check That Playbill: It's Nearly Show Time

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
The Dynasty Farewell Tour begins tonight in Boston, where Michael and the Role Players will welcome Rick Pitino back to the National Basketball Association. On the West Coast, the Lakers want to send the Jazz a message even without Shaquille O'Neal. Larry Bird and Chuck Daly are off the golf course and on the sidelines. Charles Barkley, the superstar who cries wolf, is contemplating retirement again. And two women will obliterate another barrier in American sport.
Tempering the marquee matchups, legends and historical significance is the reality that not all is well as the N.B.A. begins its 51st season. 
 Several All-Stars are out with injuries until perhaps the first of the year. John Stockton, Scottie Pippen and Alonzo Mourning are expected to miss at least the first month of the season to rehabilitate from recent surgery. Michael Jordan will have to piggyback the aging Bulls until January. And Barkley, days after allegedly tossing a 5-foot-2-inch man through a window, has not decided whether he will grace the N.B.A. with his irascible presence this season.
Philadelphia's Allen Iverson will miss the opener and Portland's Isaiah Rider will miss the first two games because of league-imposed suspensions for spending part of their summer vacation in trouble with the law.
For now, the Bulls vs. the Celtics in Pitino's return to the league and the Lakers playing host to Utah in perhaps a Western Conference title preview will try to camouflage the blemishes.
Other games with intriguing sub-plots tonight include the Indiana Pacers at the Nets in Bird's return, and the deep and talented Knicks at Charlotte, where the Hornets were swept by New York in their first-round playoff series a year ago.
O'Neal will miss the opener with a pulled abdominal muscle. And Malone, who hasn't missed a start since 1991, is questionable after injuring his middle finger on his right hand during practice yesterday. He will make a game-time decision about playing. His streak of 467 straight games, the fourth-longest active streak in the N.B.A., is in jeopardy.
New York's Buck Williams needs 64 games to move ahead of Moses Malone (1,329) and into third place on the career list of games played behind Robert Parish (1,611) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560).
Rules changes will go into effect tonight, including the lengthening of the 3-point line to its original distance of 23 feet 9 inches.
After Pat Riley, Pitino literally ushered in the coach-as-savior era. He leads a group of well-compensated gym teachers who have entered another economic stratosphere. Red Auerbach, the franchise patriarch, made $100,000 his last season as coach in 1966. The former Celtic great Dave Cowens, the league's lowest-paid coach, will make $500,000 in Charlotte this season.
Pitino's $7 million annual salary as president and coach of the Celtics doubles the $3.5 million salary of Dee Brown, Boston's highest-paid player. Pitino's best player, Antoine Walker, makes $1.9 million.
Daly in Orlando, Larry Brown in Philadelphia and Bird in Indiana also signed deals that pay them more than $4 million a season.
"It's kind of an interesting concept, but bottom line it's still the players' league," Daly said recently. "I don't care if your credentials stretch from here to 1930 and include everything in the book. If your players can't shoot, pass and dribble, it doesn't matter. You need talent."
History will indeed be made over the weekend when the referees Violet Palmer, 33, and Dee Kantner, 37, become the first women to officiate games in one of the nation's four major professional sports leagues. They were appointed by the N.B.A. earlier this week, creating a major stir among the players.
"You can't pat them on the butt," Jordan said facetiously.
Kantner laughed at the notion that she might pursue harassment charges for what remains a routine encounter between a player and an official. "I never thought I'd be answering questions like these at 37," she said. "As long as it's in the context of the game, I'm fine with it."
Finally, the league may be less than a year away from entering the post-Jordan era. Given all the concerns and absences on opening night, it is a sobering thought.
"I can give it up if I tell myself that's it," said Jordan, 35, who has hinted often of retiring again after this season. "I'm not afraid to walk away. Some people think I am. That's someone's perception of me who doesn't know me. I never think about the negative. I think about what's happening now. I'm still playing. We still got a chance to win a championship. That's how I look at it."
Said Commissioner David Stern: "If the most extraordinary athlete of our time is nearing the end of his active career, that has to be a concern to us. But we can't spend our time lamenting. We have to spend our time preparing for the post-Michael era. We are going to miss him. There's going to be a void. The question is, who's going to fill it, and the answer is, a lot of players."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE TRADING;
Aftershocks From Asia Hit Wall St.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The worldwide drop in share prices resumed with waves of selling yesterday, dragging down stock market indexes on six continents and sending Wall Street into another retreat.
The currency and economic crisis engulfing Asia -- and reverberating through wobbly stock markets there -- is worrying investors elsewhere in the world who fear a contagious economic slowdown. That has meant jitters from Tokyo to Wall Street. 
 Yesterday, after prices dropped in Hong Kong, Japan and Europe, the selling pressure reached New York and then slammed into Brazil and Argentina, where fears are growing that a banking and currency crisis might be unfolding.
Early today, stocks rose slightly in Asia. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 94 points, or almost six-tenths of 1 percent, at the close of trading. Hong Kong stocks were up 138.11 points, or about 1.33 percent at the mid-afternoon break today.
Yesterday, investors in the United States thwarted an early downturn, but a late selling spree sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 125 points, or 1.67 percent, to 7,381.67 -- about 10.6 percent off its record high set Aug. 6.
The losses appeared to send a signal to investors that the huge rebound that occurred after Monday's selloff, when the Dow plummeted 554 points, might mean the American stock market is not yet prepared to resume its historic ascent.
"I don't think the crisis is over," said David Shulman, a strategist at Salomon Brothers. "We're now getting a Latin American version of what happened in Asia, like the contagion has jumped the Pacific."
Although analysts have played down the economic threat to the United States economy -- which remains robust -- they say that investor faith in the stock market, and the idea that everything is perfect, has been breached in recent weeks.
"The prospect of unlimited growth was one of the underpinnings of the 90's bull market," Mr. Shulman said. "But that prospect is suspect for at least the next year."
Perhaps just as important, some analysts argue, is the psychological effect of seeing other bull markets topple. In Hong Kong, for instance, the main stock market index rode higher than almost any other, soaring 480 percent between late 1990 and its Sept. 7 peak this year. During the same period, the Dow was up as much as 250 percent at its peak.
Since then, the Hang Seng index has been battered, plunging 38 percent in two months, largely because of the economic and currency crisis that began in Thailand and swept across Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. In recent months, the old talk among Wall Street analysts of the great Asian Tigers has degenerated into caustic remarks about real estate bubbles and "golf course capitalism."
Trading volume was again heavy, as more than 712 million shares changed hands, making yesterday the third-busiest day in history on the New York Stock Exchange after Tuesday and Wednesday.
In fact, this has already been the busiest trading week in history on the Big Board, with more than 3.3 billion shares traded in four sessions, easily obliterating last week's record of a little more than 3 billion shares.
That kind of activity, analysts say, is a sign that investors are worried that the recent turmoil could fester and that a big portion of the spectacular gains of the last three years could be erased.
"The market was discounting perfection, and we've been slowly finding out that the world's not perfect," said Gail Dudack, the chief investment strategist at UBS Securities. "And so now the consensus has disappeared. And once you break confidence, in order to reinstill it, the market's going to have to demonstrate real value."
The day got off to a bad start, as investors woke and learned that heavy selling had resumed in Europe and Asia overnight.
In Chicago -- the epicenter of futures and options trading -- the indexes were all negative. In New York, the Dow fell 100 points at the opening. But as the day progressed, a seesaw bout took place as the index swung between negative and positive. Through much of the day, though, a broad array of smaller stocks got battered. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company issues closed down 1.4 percent.
Technology issues -- under pressure early after analysts downgraded the prospects of Dell Computer and Intel -- slid throughout the day, sending the technology-heavy Nasdaq down 32.34 points, or 2 percent, to 1,570.41.
Shares of Dell -- an issue that everyone thought was a winner -- have lost nearly 26 in the last two weeks and closed down 5 1/2 yesterday, to 78. Intel fell 4 1/2, to 75 3/4.
Banking issues also suffered over concerns that there could be large losses related to economic problems in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The Standard & Poor's bank index fell 3.2 percent yesterday, taking down all 28 of the issues listed, led by BankAmerica, which dropped 3 5/16, to 69 3/4.
The broader market was also battered. On the Big Board, 804 issues rose while 2,175 fell, and blue chips -- which showed some strength early -- suffered the worst at the close.
The S.& P. 500 fell 15.48 points, or 1.68 percent, to 903.68. And 26 of the 30 Dow stocks fell, led by J. P. Morgan, which dropped 3 7/8, to 110 3/8.
Analysts, however, insist that the United States economy is strong and that corporate earnings will not suffer greatly from the events in Asia.
Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said that although economic growth in America would slow some because of the Asian turmoil, the economy might have been threatened by overheating anyway, which would have prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. "Next year, U.S. growth would have slowed no matter what," he said. "Now it's going to slow on its own because of these outside effects, away from the U.S."
While several analysts said damage to corporate earnings would be slight, others predicted that prominent stocks would suffer as investors downgrade their expectations of profits from sales to Asia.
"The idea that every U.S. company is growing and that we were going to sell more Cokes and Nikes to China -- that may still be true, but today, it's a little less so," said Frederick Taylor, chief investment officer at the U.S. Trust Company. "So this selloff is partly fundamentals based. It's not just psychological."

 BODY:
Business activity in the New York metropolitan area rose in October from the previous month to the highest level in nearly a year, the National Association of Purchasing Management-New York said yesterday.
The New York purchasing managers index rose to 70 percent this month from September's 60.3 percent. This month's reading was the highest since last December, when the index stood at 72.9 percent. A reading above 50 percent signals growth. 
 However, looking at the next six months, New York purchasers weren't as upbeat this month as they were in September. The index of future conditions fell to 65.8 percent from 69.5 percent in September.
"Overall, the local economy continued to show solid growth in October, although the evaluation of future conditions six months hence slipped to its lowest reading since May," the report said. In May, the outlook index stood at 64.9 percent.
In addition, inflation picked up in the New York area this month, the purchasing managers said. The prices-paid index increased to 58 percent in October from 48 percent in September.

Bulls, Bears And Auctions
Will the stock market's roller-coaster performance this week affect the important Impressionist, modern and contemporary art sales that begin in 10 days in Manhattan?
The experts, putting an obviously optimistic spin on the situation, don't think so. "Money always has to find a home," said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America. "An awful lot depends on the underlying economy. If the economy is weak, the art market will falter, but right now things are strong and I think our sales will grow as they have over the past few seasons." 
 When the stock market crashed in 1987, the art market went in the opposite direction. Just three weeks after Black Monday, Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art sale broke $100 million for the first time, a 45 percent increase from six months before.
"We are optimistic that history will repeat itself," said Kevin Bousquette, chief operating officer for Sotheby's worldwide.
Mr. Burge of Christie's recalled that after the 1987 crash, prices rose even more over the next two years.
Donald B. Marron, chairman of Paine Webber and himself a major art collector, said the quality of the pictures, not stock prices, fueled the market. "Quality pictures are always in demand," he said. "But because the price of paintings have become so high, if the stock market goes down before the sales, it may well free up money for the art world and be an alternative use of capital."
 
Selling Low
For years, Henry Kravis has been a serious buyer of 19th- and early 20th-century paintings. Now the financier hopes to become a major seller, and has chosen Sotheby's, where he is a major shareholder and board member, for several important sales. But his first three efforts have not done as well as the auction house expected.
While none of the paintings he has decided to sell are listed in the catalogues with his name, experts in the field who are familiar with his collection have identified them.
In a sale last week in Manhattan, Mr. Kravis offered Winterhalter's "Young Woman From L'Ariccia" (1838), which was featured on the cover of Sotheby's 19th-century paintings catalogue. The work was expected to bring $2 million to $2.5 million, but sold for $1.7 million.
He also sold two paintings by Delacroix: "An Arab Horse" (1840-1850), for which $1.4 million to $1.8 million was expected but $992,500 received, and "Greek Officer (1823-1824), which carried an estimate of $350,000 to $500,000 and sold for $343,500.
Prices include the auction house's commission, which is 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.
The results are not stopping Mr. Kravis from selling more. In December, four of his Sargents will be in Sotheby's American-paintings sale in Manhattan.
The most important is "In the Garden, Corfu" (1909), which experts say is likely to fetch $5 million to $7 million. The painting depicts two women reading in a garden, and is considered so important that it might break the record for an American painting sold at auction as well as the record for a Sargent. The Sargent record was set when "Cashmere" (1908) sold in December at Christie's for $11.1 million.
The three other Sargents Mr. Kravis is selling are "The Rialto" (circa 1909), which is expected to sell for $3 million to $5 million; "The Venetian Wine Shop" (1898), which is also estimated to bring $3 million to $5 million, and "A Gust of Wind" (circa 1886), expected to bring $700,000 to $900,000.
That would leave Mr. Kravis with two Sargents. The better, "A Morning Walk" (1888), shows a woman with a parasol; the other is a 1902 portrait of Charles Stuart, Sixth Marquess of Londonderry.
The financier is disposing of his paintings, experts say, because they are not in keeping with his new wife's taste. Marie-Josee Kravis, whom Mr. Kravis married three years ago, prefers fine French furniture and Old Master paintings, they said, while Mr. Kravis's former wife, Carolyne Roehm, liked 19th-century paintings.
Mr. Kravis did not return telephone calls. Officials at Sotheby's declined to comment on the sales.
 
Poussin to Los Angeles
Persistence has paid off. The J. Paul Getty Museum, whose history of trying to import paintings from England has been rocky, just received permission from the British authorities to bring Nicolas Poussin's "Landscape With Calm" (1650) to California, where it will become part of the Getty's permanent collection.
The painting, considered one of the 17th-century French painter's most important works, will hang in a big gallery of Italian and French paintings when the Getty opens its new $1 billion campus in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles in December.
The Getty bought the painting for a reported $25.6 million from the trustees of Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, who were selling it to raise money to save the castle.
But before the painting could leave England, the British Export Review Committee had to determine that no British institutions or private collectors were willing to match the Getty's price and keep the work in Britain.
The process is neither simple nor quick, as the Getty knows all too well. It waited five years before learning it could not export Canova's "Three Graces," for which it was willing to pay $12 million, because the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Galleries of Scotland had raised enough money to match the price. While the Poussin purchase has a happy ending for the California museum, the painting was bought seven months ago and not until the end of last week was its export license granted.
Luckily for the Getty, there are already 20 Poussins in British museums and 19 more in private collections in England so no major British institution or collector tried to buy the painting.

 CORRECTION:
A brief report in the Inside Art column on Friday about Henry Kravis's sales of part of his art collection misidentified the New York auction house where John Singer Sargent's "Cashmere" (1908) was sold in December for $11.1 million, a record for the artist. It was Sotheby's, not Christie's.
