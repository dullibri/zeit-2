HEADLINE: The Europe-in-Rubble Excuse

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Bad history, worse economics. 

 BODY:
Whenever I point out how well America did with strong unions and highly progressive taxation after World War II, I can count on conservatives trying to resolve their cognitive dissonance by saying "but it was easy then -- all our competitors were in ruins!" You can see this all over the comments on today's column. 
Sorry, guys, but that's bad history and very bad economics.
On the history: the great postwar boom wasn't just a few years after the war; it was a whole generation long, from 1947 to 1973 -- well into an era in which Europe had very much recovered. Here's West German GDP per capita as a share of US GDP per capita:
The Europe-in-ruins era was long over while the US boom was still going strong.
But the bad history is incidental; the really key point is that this is nonsense economics. Yes, our competitors were in ruins for a while; so were our customers (who were more or less the same countries). Basically, we had nobody to trade with. Here's exports and imports as a percentage of US GDP:
There's a brief surge in exports in the late 1940s; that's the Marshall Plan. But through the 50s and 60s America essentially did very little trade, exports or imports. If you think that's good for the economy, you should be all for extreme protectionism.
Actually, there's a substantial trade theory literature on the effect of other countries' growth on our income and purchasing power, which says that it can go either way -- more competition, but also bigger markets, with the net effect depending on how it affects our terms of trade, the ratio of export to import prices. There's a slight presumption of positive effects from foreign growth, which becomes a much stronger presumption if the foreign economies start very small -- which is exactly the situation after World War II. So the whole notion that we had it easy because Europe was destroyed is just ignorant.
And anyone who reflexively reaches for the idea that we were actually better off because Europe was in ruins as a way to explain the postwar economy should take a hard look in the mirror. Did you think this through? Or were you just grabbing for something, anything, to explain away a fact that your ideology says can't have been true?

HEADLINE: Glencore-Xstrata Deal Goes to a Vote

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The merger between Glencore and Xstrata looks on track to win approval on Tuesday. | With Hostess planning to close, Twinkies, Ho Hos and other iconic products will likely be on the block. | Cisco Systems is buying Meraki for about $1.2 billion. | Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is having discussions with the president on ways to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. 

 BODY:
GLENCORE-XSTRATA DEAL GOES TO A VOTE | After months of negotiations, the merger between the trading firm Glencore International and the mining company Xstrata looks on track to win investor approval. Shareholders are set to vote on Tuesday on the $32 billion merger, and on retention bonuses potentially worth more than $200 million. Last week, the sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding, which had opposed the initial offer, voiced its support. While shareholders seem ready to approve the deal, it is less clear how they will view the retention bonuses for executives, which are subject to a separate vote. Qatar Holding, which has a 12 percent stake in Xstrata, said it would abstain from that vote, citing "the sensitivities concerning governance issues in the U.K." It is also unclear what may happen if the merger is approved but the retention bonuses are rejected. "There is a chance the combination may backfire," Bloomberg News writes. Xstrata's managers might, in theory, walk away - "an unsettling thought to some longtime followers of the company." 
WHAT'S NEXT FOR HOSTESS? | With Hostess planning to close up shop, Twinkies, Ho Hos and other iconic products will likely be on the block. "The Hostess brands could look especially appealing, without the baggage of the company's debt and labor costs. Even though consumers are increasingly crunching on kale, Twinkies and other sugary snacks still make loads of money," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. Buyers might include Wall Street types like the Gordon Brothers Group and Hilco Consumer Capital, which bought the assets of Polaroid in 2009. There might also be interest from companies like Flowers Foods, which picked up Tasty Baking last year, and Grupo Bimbo, the Mexican company that owns Arnold bread and Entenmann's pastries, Mr. de la Merced writes. The private equity firm C. Dean Metropoulos & Company, which owns the Pabst Brewing Company, said it might bid for Hostess's brands, according to Bloomberg News. In any sale of these brands, the company's employees and other unsecured creditors "will be the real losers," the DealBook columnist Stephen J. Lubben writes. On Monday, a bankruptcy judge is set to consider Hostess's plans to close its operations.
The company's announcement on Friday stirred nostalgia in many Americans, despite their complicated relationship with Hostess products. "There was a time when, if given a choice between a warm pastry fresh from a baker's oven and an ageless package of Ring Dings fresh from the 7-Eleven, you would have chosen those Ring Dings," The New York Times columnist Dan Barry writes. "Not even close."
CISCO EXPANDS IN THE CLOUD | Cisco Systems said on Sunday that it would buy Meraki for about $1.2 billion, continuing a wave of deal-making in cloud computing. The deal for Meraki, which is backed by the likes of Google and Sequoia Partners, is Cisco's latest in a string of acquisitions this year. 
ON THE AGENDA | As the Federal Housing Administration tries to avoid a taxpayer bailout, a fresh portrait of the housing market comes at 10 a.m. with data on existing home sales in October. In London, hedge fund managers will gather for the first Ira Sohn Conference held in the city. In New York, the conference has been a venue for prominent investors to discuss their strategies. Lowe's and Tyson Foods report earnings before the opening bell, and Urban Outfitters announces results on Monday evening. Steve Case, the AOL co-founder, is on CNBC at 8 a.m.
TRYING TO AVOID THE 'CLIFF' | Even Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, who has become one of the White House's most vocal critics on Wall Street, is having discussions with President Obama on ways to avoid the so-called. Mr. Dimon met with the president over the weekend, as did Warren E. Buffett, to talk about the tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect at the start of next year, according to Reuters. With the outlook uncertain, many businesses are taking steps now to protect themselves, Nathaniel Popper and Nelson D. Schwartz report in The New York Times. "In my 30 years in practice, I've never seen such a flood of desire and action to transfer a business and cash out," said Kenneth K. Bezozo, a partner in New York with the law firm Haynes & Boone.
THE BILLION-DOLLAR START-UP CLUB | It may seem exciting from the outside, but having your start-up valued at more than $1 billion limits your options, Nick Bilton writes on the Bits blog. For one, you have few potential buyers. "Apple, Google and maybe Microsoft are on a short list of corporations that could finance an acquisition of this size without reaching for lint in their pockets afterward," Mr. Bilton writes. Going public also looks less attractive, especially after Facebook's I.P.O. If your start-up is ultimately deemed overvalued, it "may have no option but to perform so-called down round investments, where a round of private financing prices a company at a lower valuation than a previous investment," something that almost happened to Spotify.

HEADLINE: The 2012 Election, in a Relative Sense

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Relative to the national popular vote, the partisan lean in many states moved only slightly, and just one state flipped from leaning toward one party to the other. 

 BODY:
For President Obama, re-election proved to be a more nerve-racking ride than his election. Four years ago, aided by an unpopular Republican incumbent, a financial crisis and a wave of enthusiasm, Mr. Obama defeated John McCain by seven percentage points in the national popular vote.
His fight for a second term was more of a slog. The economic recovery was steady but tepid, and while some states are still tallying votes, Mr. Obama leads former Mitt Romney by just under three percentage points nationally. 
In 46 states and the District of Columbia, President Obama did worse in 2012 than he did in 2008, winning by less or losing by more. The vote in most counties, too, shifted to the political right.
But separating out the national political environment from more fundamental and potentially longer-lasting political shifts at the state level is harder. Relative to the national popular vote, the picture is muddled: 29 states and the District of Columbia shifted toward Mr. Obama, and 21 states shifted toward the Republican Party. But the partisan lean in most states moved only slightly, and only one state flipped from leaning toward one party to the other. 
 State-Level Margins Relative to the Nation
(Ordered by Shift in Relative Vote) 
Some of the most emphatic shifts are explained by home-state effects. Alaska, where the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin served as governor, was 12 percentage points less Republican-leaning this year. In Utah, where a majority of residents share the Mormon faith with Mr. Romney, the vote was 15 percentage points more Republican-leaning in 2012.
Many of the states that, relative to the nation, moved toward the Democratic Party have large minority populations, including New Jersey, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York and Maryland.
Non-demographic factors may have also shifted the vote in certain states. Two of the states that moved furthest to the left bore the brunt of Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey and New York. There is the possibility that Sandy (and Gov. Chris Christie's effusive praise of Mr. Obama on the president's trip to see the damage in New Jersey) had an effect. Exit polls showed that Mr. Obama's highest levels of support among Republicans were in New York and New Jersey.
The 2012 battleground states hardly shifted at all relative to the national popular vote. Wisconsin, home to vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan, moved furthest right, shifting by three percentage points toward the Republicans.
Florida moved furthest left. In 2008, Mr. Obama carried Florida, but the state was 4.5 percentage points more Republican-leaning than the nation. If the Sunshine State's relative lean had remained around 4 percent, Mr. Romney would have carried the state in 2012. But Florida's fast-growing, non-Cuban Hispanic population appears to have given Mr. Obama a boost. Florida is still a red-leaning state, but by under two percentage points now.
At the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Romney substantially over-performed Mr. McCain in Indiana and Missouri. Both were battleground states in 2008 but were largely uncontested in 2012. Left alone by the campaigns, Indiana and Missouri seem to have reverted to their normal Republican lean.
West Virginia, too, seems to have moved even further away from the Democratic Party at the presidential level. And Mr. Romney also far outperformed Mr. McCain in the northern Great Plains states, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. Although, it appears Mr. Romney's coattails were short, as Democrats won surprising victories in Senate races in North Dakota and Montana.
But over all, when the swing in the national political environment is subtracted out, most states didn't shift that far left or right. Twenty-six states moved by two percentage points or less. Arranged by the margin of victory relative to the national popular vote, the states -- with a few exceptions -- fall in the same order as they did in 2008.
 State-Level Margins Relative to the Nation
(Ordered by 2012 Lean) 
Colorado -- the tipping point state in 2008 -- barely budged relative to the nation and so played the role of tipping point again in 2012.
Virginia also barely moved. It was just one percentage point more left-leaning in 2012 relative to the country.
However, Virginia's small shift happened to be across the nation's partisan dividing line. Relative to the national popular vote, Virginia was the only state to flip from Republican-leaning in 2008 to Democratic-leaning in 2012. No state flipped from Democratic-leaning to Republican-leaning.
By the count as of now, Mr. Obama won the national popular vote by 2.8 percentage points and carried Virginia by 3.1 percentage points, giving Virginia, at least for now, a slim Democratic lean of 0.3 percentage points.
Mr. Obama's national margin of victory has been inching up as the final outstanding votes are counted. If it eclipses his margin in Virginia, that state will remain -- by a hair -- a red one. But as things stand now, Virginia, for the first time since the 1948 election, has become -- just barely -- a blue state.

HEADLINE: Views Differ on Age of Planet

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: He's not a scientist, man. 

 BODY:
Quite a few bloggers are having fun with Marco Rubio's bobbing and weaving in response to a question from GQ:
 GQ: How old do you think the Earth is?
 Marco Rubio: I'm not a scientist, man. I can tell you what recorded history says, I can tell you what the Bible says, but I think that's a dispute amongst theologians and I think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States. I think the age of the universe has zero to do with how our economy is going to grow. I'm not a scientist. I don't think I'm qualified to answer a question like that. At the end of the day, I think there are multiple theories out there on how the universe was created and I think this is a country where people should have the opportunity to teach them all. I think parents should be able to teach their kids what their faith says, what science says. Whether the Earth was created in 7 days, or 7 actual eras, I'm not sure we'll ever be able to answer that. It's one of the great mysteries. 
As I like to say, the GOP doesn't just want to roll back the New Deal; it wants to roll back the Enlightenment.
But here's what you should realize: when Rubio says that the question of the Earth's age "has zero to do with how our economy is going to grow", he's dead wrong. For one thing, science and technology education has a lot to do with our future productivity -- and how are you going to have effective science education if schools have to give equal time to the views of fundamentalist Christians? 
More broadly, the attitude that discounts any amount of evidence -- and boy, do we have lots of evidence on the age of the planet! -- if it conflicts with prejudices is not an attitude consistent with effective policy. If you're going to ignore what geologists say if you don't like its implications, what are the chances that you'll take sensible advice on monetary and fiscal policy? After all, we've just seen how Republicans deal with research reports that undermine their faith in the magic of tax cuts: they try to suppress the reports.
I'm belatedly reading Chris Mooney's The Republican Brain; if truth be told, I was afraid that the book would be too much red meat for my own predispositions, and wanted to keep my cool. But Mooney actually makes a very good point: the personality traits we associate with modern conservatism, above all a lack of openness, make the modern GOP fundamentally hostile to the very idea of objective inquiry. If they want your opinion, they'll tell you what it is; doubters of orthodoxy need not apply, and will in fact be persecuted.
So don't laugh over Rubio's young-earth apologetics. If he, or anyone else from his party, wins in 2016, the joke will be on us.

HEADLINE: Mixed Results for S.E.C. in Financial Crisis Cases

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: For the Securities and Exchange Commission, proving that an individual broke the law is much more difficult because juries seem to find it much easier to put the blame on the organization while exonerating those who work there. 

 BODY:
Last week was a study in contrasts in how the Securities and Exchange Commission has been able to pursue cases from the financial crisis. The regulator has been successful in extracting large settlements from banks that were are the heart of the meltdown in the mortgage market, but it has not done as well in proving any significant wrongdoing by individuals.
That raises the issue of why the agency has been able to pursue the large institutions but does not bring cases against senior managers overseeing those companies for violations of the federal securities laws. The problem is that proving an individual broke the law is much more difficult because juries seem to find it much easier to put the blame on the organization while exonerating those who work there. 
The S.E.C. announced settlements on Friday with JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisseover their dealings in residential mortgage-backed securities. JPMorgan will pay $296.9 million and Credit Suisse $120 million in disgorgement and penalties.
 In addition to those cases, the S.E.C. got in on the settlement with BPlast week over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, settling securities fraud charges that the company made misleading statements about the amount of oil flowing from its well. BP agreed to pay a $525 million that will be distributed to its investors.
All told, the S.E.C. collected over $900 million that can be passed along to investors, which is not a bad haul for one week. But it had a much worse week in dealing with individuals accused of securities fraud.
On Monday, a federal jury in New York largely absolved Bruce Bent Sr. and his son, Bruce Bent II, for statements they made about the money market fund they oversaw, the Reserve Primary Fund, that collapsed at the height of the financial crisis in September 2008. 
According to the S.E.C.'s allegations, the Bents misled investors in the face of substantial withdrawals because of concerns about bonds it owned from Lehman Brothers, which had just gone into bankruptcy. In the parlance of the money market industry, there was a question whether losses from Lehman would cause the fund to "break the buck" by reporting a net asset value of less than $1, something that is anathema to investors. The case focused on statements made over two days about how the Bents intended to shore up the fund's assets to protect its net asset value, which did not come to pass and the firm stopped redemptions. 
The S.E.C. accused both Bents and their investment advisory firm of violating the two primary securities fraud provisions, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. An important difference between the two provisions is the level of intent needed for a violation: Section 10(b) requires at least recklessness, while Section 17(a) can be established by proof of only negligence.
The contrast in the jury's verdict was striking. The advisory firm was held liable for the violations. Mr. Bent II was held responsible for being negligent in permitting the misstatements but not for acting recklessly. Mr. Bent Sr. was exonerated.
The verdict shows the split approach that juries can take to these types of cases. A company acts only through its officers and employees, so it is hard to see how the organization can commit a fraud if no individual is also responsible for the misconduct. But a jury is not required to be entirely consistent in its decisions, so it can find one defendant liable while absolving another.
That result often reflects how difficult it can be for a jury to look suspects in the eye and say that they engaged in fraud, especially when there is the option of holding a faceless organization liable. There can be a touch of King Solomon in a jury, trying to "split the baby" by avoiding a decision to impose the highest penalty on someone who claims to have acted in good faith while assuaging themselves by finding the company liable.
The challenge the S.E.C. faces in holding individuals liable for corporate misconduct came even clearer when it filed a motion to dismiss charges against Edward S. Steffelin for his role in putting together a synthetic collateralized debt obligation based on mortgage securities that was sold by JPMorgan Chase. The bank settled the case by paying $153.6 million in disgorgement and penalties in June 2011.
Mr. Steffelin did not work at the bank but at an outside firm that selected the portfolio of securities on which the C.D.O. was based. He was accused of not revealing in marketing materials the role of a hedge fund in selecting the securities. The S.E.C. only alleged that he violated Section 17(a) by acting negligently, not that he committed intentional fraud.
By dismissing the charges with prejudice, the agency effectively acknowledged that it could not prove its case despite having gathered evidence during an extensive investigation and obtaining a settlement from JPMorgan. on Saturday that Mr. Steffelin was "a victim of regulatory overreach."
This is not the first time the S.E.C. has been unable to hold an individual responsible under the more forgiving negligence standard. In August, a jury exonerated a mid-level manager at Citigroup who was accused of making inadequate disclosure in the sale of a C.D.O. similar to the one Mr. Steffelin helped construct. Once again, the bank settled, agreeing to a $285 million payment, which is the subject of an appeal over whether the S.E.C. should have required it to admit wrongdoing.
If it is so difficult to hold individuals liable, why don't the banks try to fight the S.E.C.? The case filed against Goldman Sachs in April 2010 over its sale of a C.D.O. is probably the best illustration about why it can be so costly just to have charges filed against a firm. The hit to Goldman's reputation was much greater than the $550 million the firm eventually paid to settle the case a few months later, so firms are usually willing to settle quickly to keep the case from dragging on in public.
The result of the Primary Reserve case shows that juries are willing to hold the organization liable while largely exonerating the individuals. We live with the inconsistent verdicts of juries applying the same legal standard. The message to the S.E.C. from these cases is to tread carefully when considering whom to accuse of misconduct.

HEADLINE: Fewer Homes Now Underwater

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The proportion of homes with negative equity continues to fall, a report from Zillow finds. 

 BODY:
Home values rose 1.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, according to Zillow's home value index.
As a result, negative equity -- the unfortunate condition that occurs when your home is worth less than your mortgage -- fell again in the third quarter, the report found. 
Currently, 28.2 percent of all homeowners in the United States with mortgages have negative equity (otherwise known as being underwater), down from 30.9 percent in the second quarter, Zillow says. The drop is significant, Zillow says, because it is the first time that overall negative equity has fallen below 30 percent since the site revised its methodology in early 2011.
Roughly 14 million homeowners with mortgages were underwater in the quarter, down from 15.3 million in the second quarter. In addition, the country's 30 largest metropolitan areas experienced a quarter-to-quarter decline in negative equity, the report said.
Of those 30 metro areas, the five with the largest declines in negative equity were Phoenix (down 6.2 percentage points), Las Vegas (down 5.5 percentage points), Denver (down 4.9 percentage points), Sacramento, Calif. (down 4.6 percentage points) and Orlando, Fla. (down 4.2 percentage points).
Much of the decline was caused by rising home values. Home values rose 1.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, to a median value of $153,800, according to Zillow's home value index.
"The fall in negative equity rates means homeowners have additional options for refinancing or selling their homes," Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, said in a statement.
But he cautioned that a "substantial number" of homes were still underwater, which made their owners reluctant to put them on the market. In addition, risks in the overall economy -- like the unresolved federal budget negotiations -- could hurt the housing market's momentum, he said.
Zillow's negative equity report analyzes current outstanding loan amounts for owner-occupied homes and compares them with the estimated values of those homes. Loan data comes from TransUnion, one of the three major credit-reporting bureaus.

HEADLINE: Marco Rubio Is 'Not a Scientist'

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: In an interview with GQ, he said the age of the earth was "one of the great mysteries." 

 BODY:
Marco Rubio is a Republican senator from Florida. He is sometimes called the "crown prince" of the Tea Party movement. He will likely run for president in 2016. He sits on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. He is not a scientist. 
As has been widely re-reported, the December issue of GQ features an interview with Mr. Rubio in which Michael Hainey asked, "How old do you think the Earth is?"
Mr. Rubio responded:
I'm not a scientist, man. I can tell you what recorded history says, I can tell you what the Bible says, but I think that's a dispute amongst theologians and I think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States. I think the age of the universe has zero to do with how our economy is going to grow. I'm not a scientist. I don't think I'm qualified to answer a question like that. At the end of the day, I think there are multiple theories out there on how the universe was created and I think this is a country where people should have the opportunity to teach them all. I think parents should be able to teach their kids what their faith says, what science says. Whether the Earth was created in 7 days, or 7 actual eras, I'm not sure we'll ever be able to answer that. It's one of the great mysteries.
Mr. Rubio surely knows that, according to Gallup, 46 percent of Americans and 58 percent of Republicans believe in creationism, or more specifically that "God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years." Mr. Rubio probably figured that these same Republicans have no truck with geologists, and so there was no advantage to stating clearly that the earth is 4.54 billion years old.
But if his response was more proof of cunning than idiocy, it was still ludicrous. There's "a dispute among theologians" and "there are multiple theories." It follows that the truth is unknowable (it's "one of the great mysteries.") Therefore we should throw up our hands and "teach them all." Conservatives often accuse liberals of relativism, but Mr. Rubio grabbed that mantle by arguing that all viewpoints are equally valid.

HEADLINE: The Macroeconomics of Raising Robots (or Children)

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: When it comes to investing in our nation's children, parents and nonparents alike should all be on the same side. 

 BODY:
On the Economix blog, Nancy Folbre has another take on our cost-benefit analysis of child-rearing, one that the parents among us, and their supporters, will love. In "Of Parents, Puppies and Robots," she writes:
Capitalism, that masterful force, would have to pay much more for workers if families weren't willing to pony up most of the time, money and effort necessary to raise them, train them and educate them. 
Imagine a world in which businesses could largely rely on highly customized battery-powered robots but would require some humans to design, build and program them. In a competitive market, the price of robots would be determined by the cost of producing them, including the wages demanded by their human producers.
What a boon it would be to businesses - and to their consumers - if some humans so loved the process of creating robots that they were willing to do so for free, happily lavishing their own resources on the production of evermore beautiful and skilled models.
As the founders of Too Small to Fail, a campaign created in the hope of mobilizing a national discussion about "the need to invest in our nation's future: our kids," write, we as a nation are very reliant on our passionate "robot-producers," and we count on them to produce those "robots" with very little help.
Budgets reflect choices. The way we spend our money is not just about economics; it's about our values and priorities. And we, as Americans, have made a disturbing choice.
We have chosen not to support our kids.
We talk a good game, but at the federal and state levels, we have systematically chosen to invest in support for seniors, the military, "too big to fail" institutions, prisons -- but we have consistently chosen not to protect and support children.
These discussions and debates among the "childless" and the "child-ridden" are always entertaining, but as Ms. Folbre highlights, they do risk masking the larger issue. Say what you will about the environment and population growth, we do, as a nation, need our children. We need them to be healthy, well educated and prepared to take on the roles we adults fill now and more. We need them trained for the jobs that Thomas L. Friedman described in his column "If You've Got the Skills, She's Got the Job": the basic welding jobs that now require a knowledge of math and metallurgy. We need them trained as doctors and nurses and bankers and pilots, and we will, someday, be counting on them to do those jobs well.
And most of us, parents or not, love some child, somewhere. We are former children ourselves. We are sisters and aunts and neighbors, or maybe, in the words of the "gay uncle" Evan James in his Modern Love column, "august queer elders."
As the parents among us embark on what, for many, will be a week of travel among the childless and those whose long-grown children were once far better behaved than our own, and the nonparents brave family members demanding to know if and when they will supply the nieces and grandchildren so many relatives seem to require, Thanksgiving week is an excellent time to remember that we are all on the same side. We may not exactly want to support the particular child whining in the airplane seat across the aisle (whether it's ours or not). But in a pre-election survey conducted by the Center for the Next Generation, nearly two-thirds of voters put issues that affect children and families high on the list of priorities for the next four years, and 88 percent agreed that we should make the same commitment to America's children as we have to our elderly.
Federally, we spend $7 on programs for elderly people for every $1 spent on programs for children. The result of that has been an incredible reduction in the number of older people living in poverty since the 1970s - but 21 percent of the children in the United States live in families with incomes below the poverty level, the highest percentage since 1993 and the highest numbers (about 16.4 million) since 1962.
Happy parents and happy nonparents alike can agree that, as we head into the coming debate over the federal budget and the so-called fiscal cliff, figuring out how to support children without abandoning the elderly should be a priority. The usual debates about how to do that can, and will, rage over the turkey and across the aisle. We will never really resolve who among us is happier with our choices. This question of leaving nearly a quarter of our nation's children with very little choice at all, though, is one we can't afford to set aside.

HEADLINE: The Rising Sea, and the Urge to Fight It

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: Dauphin Island, Ala., rebuilt time and again, presents a microcosm of the issues facing American beachfront communities as the seas advance. 

 BODY:
In an article in The Times, my colleague Felicity Barringer and I explore the issue of whether it makes sense to keep rebuilding, largely at the expense of federal taxpayers, in hazard-prone coastal areas. We made passing reference to a debate over the causes of beach erosion in Dauphin Island, Ala. 
The situation there is worth exploring a bit further, for it sheds light on some of the broad issues the nation will have to confront along its coastlines in coming decades.
As we mentioned, local residents blame the Army Corps of Engineers for their erosion problems. In the role it plays in many parts of the country, the Corps conducts frequent dredging operations in the nearby Mobile Ship Channel, to the east of Dauphin Island, so that oceangoing cargo vessels can make use of the Port of Mobile. 
Why would that make any difference? 
Many people imagine that beaches and barrier islands are just mountains of sand that sit unmoving at the edge of our shores. In reality, they are highly dynamic systems, constantly moving and adjusting to storms, currents and changes in sea level.
Sand actually flows up and down our shorelines, by the billions of tons, and often there's a net direction to this flow, known as "littoral drift" or "longshore transport." That is to say, averaged over time, more sand flows one way than the other. The beaches we see above water are but a small part of this system. Far more sand lies offshore, and these unseen hills of sediment play a crucial role in the overall sand supply to beaches down the line.

Along the Alabama and Mississippi stretch of the Gulf Coast, the net drift of sand is from east to west. When sand from further east falls into the Mobile Ship Channel, the Corps dredges it out to keep the channel clear - and then, Dauphin Island residents and some scientists contend, dumps it in spots far enough away that the sand is lost to the littoral drift. The Corps does so to save money, under a mandate from Congress to conduct its operations in the most cost-effective way.
"We have interrupted the longshore sand transport for 70 years to maintain the ship channel," said Scott L. Douglass, a coastal engineer at the University of South Alabama and a consultant to the town of Dauphin Island. "If we don't fix the long-term problem, the island will continue to lose area and degenerate."
The Corps has sharply disputed that assessment, financing a 330-page study that concluded that its operations are not the real reason that Dauphin Island is eroding. Dr. Douglass contends that study should be taken with a grain of sea salt, considering the financial stake the Corps has in the issue. He points to a 2007 study by the United States Geological Survey that determined that ship dredging does play a role.
Here is the larger point: Up and down the nation's coastlines, humans have had a direct impact on barrier islands, sometimes in ways that accelerate their natural erosion. Ship channel maintenance is an issue in many places, but so is the construction of groins, jetties and sea walls - all structures that appear to slow beach erosion but have been shown in scientific studies to make it worse over a longer time frame. Planners have often made these decisions for reasons that seemed to make short-term financial sense, only to discover they are economically dubious over the long term.
The particular history of Dauphin Island prompts local residents to argue that federal help for storm recovery is warranted - after all, in their view, the federal government helped create their erosion problem in the first place. And as our article pointed out, they have received a lot of help. Counting payments for the reconstruction of homes and infrastructure, and adjusting for inflation, the total since 1978 approaches $200 million - for an island with a resident population of 1,300 people.
The Dauphin Islanders want even more help than that - as much as $60 million for a "beach nourishment" project in which sand would be dredged from seven miles offshore and pumped onto their beaches.
So far, Washington has said no. Since the administration of Ronald Reagan, the federal government has been trying to get out of the business of paying for beach restoration. Even in southern Alabama, the idea of a big federal beach project for Dauphin Island draws scorn. "Not with my tax money!" said George F. Crozier, a marine scientist who headed a scientific institute, Dauphin Island Sea Lab, for many years but lives on the mainland. 
Dr. Douglass sighed as we discussed this issue at his university, also on the mainland. "I want to put sand on a barrier island that's made out of sand, and I get all kinds of grief," he said.
The opposition comes not just from taxpayers, but from environmental groups and coastal geologists. Across the country, they are deeply skeptical of beach restoration projects. And when the question is whether the federal government should put up the money, conservative and libertarian groups also join in the criticism.
The environmental critique is that beach dredging is an unsustainable, short-term solution to a long-term problem. Even worse, some groups argue, a beach project can create incentives for fresh development along coastlines, requiring still more federal subsidies and increasing the nation's long-term vulnerability to storms. 
Again, Dauphin Island is a good microcosm of the larger issues.
The island is shaped somewhat like a tadpole. The eastern side of the island, the body of the tadpole, is an ancient barrier island with a substantial elevation and large dunes, supporting a maritime forest and a major bird sanctuary. It is somewhat protected from storms, and historically, it was the only part of the island that was settled.
That was because old-timers knew better than to build on the western end of the island - the tail of the tadpole. It is basically a long sandbar only a few feet above the Gulf of Mexico. Storm damage and erosion are most severe there. But it is the western end that supports many of the big beach houses owned by out-of-towners, and they are a major part of Dauphin Island's tax base.
If dredging in the ship channel is one of Dauphin Island's problems, it is certainly not the only one. When I visited the western end in the company of the mayor, Jeff Collier, it seemed obvious that this part of the island is trying to migrate toward the mainland. I later confirmed my impression in talking with several coastal scientists, including Dr. Douglass and Orrin H. Pilkey, an emeritus professor at Duke University who is thought of as the dean of American coastal geologists.
On the south side of the island, fronting the Gulf of Mexico, hundreds of feet of beach have eroded. Numerous lots that were platted and sold in the 1950's are now inundated by the sea, and the houses that once stood there are gone, many of them knocked down by Hurricane Katrina. The gulf is now lapping at the pilings of surviving houses that used to be three rows back.
"That island is virtually migrating out from under those buildings," Dr. Pilkey told me. "It's just so amazing. There is no worse example of unsafe development on barrier islands than Dauphin Island - nothing else like it in North America."
As the front erodes, the back of the island keeps growing, as storms carry sand over the top and deposit it at the rear. I saw boat houses and docks that had been marooned on dry land. 
One island resident whom I interviewed by phone, Jack L. Gaines II, has lived on the north side of the island since 1999. "I've watched the south beach erode and come toward us," he said. "I've accreted 600 feet of property."
This may sound familiar to the victims of Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey, some of whom are still shoveling sand out of their living rooms. Scientists say it is no coincidence that the pattern is similar from Dauphin Island to Long Island.
The simple reality is that the nation's barrier islands are attempting to move inland, a natural response to an unnatural situation.
Scientists say that global warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases is causing the sea to rise. If left to their own devices, barrier islands would respond to that rise by migrating landward, and so would the marshes behind them. As storms wash the sand from front to back, the islands would essentially roll uphill, a classic process that scientists have dubbed island rollover.
The problem, of course, is that people have planted buildings on these shifting sands and declared that they can no longer be allowed to move. On the Jersey Shore as on Dauphin Island, Mother Nature seems to be telling us what she thinks of that proposition.
The rise of the sea is projected to accelerate in coming decades, perhaps sharply. If that forecast is correct, it means once-rare episodes of coastal flooding, like Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina, will become routine. 
The costs of subsidizing coastal reconstruction are already soaring. At some point, it seems clear, the nation is going to have to make decisions about what parts of the coastline it can afford to defend against a rising ocean - and then figure out what to do in the places it cannot defend.
"You have to look at Dauphin Island as a microcosm of what the whole country is facing, really," Mayor Collier told me. "It ought to be a wake-up call."

HEADLINE: Private Equity and Hostess Stumbling Together

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: While few tears should be shed for the private equity firm Ripplewood, the owner of Hostess brands, no one should conclude that Ripplewood was trying to make a quick profit and then leave. 

 BODY:
"What's happening with Hostess Brands is a microcosm of what's wrong with America, as Bain-style Wall Street vultures make themselves rich by making America poor."
That was Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation's main union federation, on the collapse of the maker of Twinkies last week. He added: "Crony capitalism and consistently poor management drove Hostess into the ground, but its workers are paying the price."
Notice he was quick to invoke Bain-style, as in Bain Capital of Mitt Romney fame, as a populist synonym for corporate rape and pillage. On Twitter, a new adverb - a pejorative, really - emerged in conversations about Hostess: Bained. 
 While Bain has nothing to do with Hostess, another private equity firm does: Ripplewood Holdings. That firm took control of Hostess as part of a bankruptcy process in 2009.
But the story of Hostess and private equity - at least over the last couple of years - is hardly the cliché that Bained portrays. No tears need to be shed for Ripplewood and its investors, but they weren't part of a get-rich-quick scheme either.
Ripplewood, which was founded by Timothy C. Collins, a major Democratic donor, is expected to lose most, if not all, of the $130 million or so it invested in Hostess. The company's lenders, led by Silver Point Capital and Monarch Alternative Capital, are not expected to fare well either.
The behind-the-scenes tale of Hostess and Ripplewood may be the opposite of a project to buy it, strip it and flip it. When Mr. Collins originally looked at Hostess, he was trying to make investments in troubled companies with union workers. He was convinced that he could work with labor organizations to turn around iconic American businesses, and he hoped Hostess would become a model for similar deals.
Early on, Mr. Collins sought out Richard A. Gephardt, the former House majority leader, who had become a consultant on labor issues, to help Ripplewood acquire Hostess and work with its unions. Mr. Collins had previously been a donor to Mr. Gephardt's election campaigns, according to an article in Fortune magazine this year that described the relationship.
It was Mr. Collins's relationship with Mr. Gephardt - a Democrat and longtime friend of labor - that helped make the deal happen in the first place. 
While Ripplewood sought significant concessions from the unions in 2009, some insiders and outside analysts privately suggested that Ripplewood did not fight hard enough for even greater givebacks from the unions in the bankruptcy process - savings worth $110 million - perhaps as a function of Mr. Collins's relationship with Mr. Gephardt. In addition, the company was saddled with $670 million in debt, which had jumped by about $200 million as part of the sale during bankruptcy.
Ripplewood's luck - and its investment thesis - could not have been worse. With the sputtering economy, the increase in commodity costs, pressure from competitors that were consolidating and out-of-whack labor costs, Hostess's fate seemed assured from nearly the beginning. Still, Ripplewood continued to throw good money after bad trying to keep Hostess from faltering.
And unlike some of the horror stories we hear about private equity firms paying themselves huge dividends and leveraging their companies even further, Ripplewood didn't do that.
Having said all that, Ripplewood's management was far from a model for the industry. For at least the first year of the new ownership, Ripplewood charged Hostess management and consulting fees, according to people briefed on the payments, which were "in the millions of dollars." As Hostess's balance sheet worsened, Ripplewood stopped seeking the payments, these people said.
Worse still, Mr. Gephardt's son was added to the board of Hostess and paid an annual fee of $100,000.
Perhaps the most egregious sin of Ripplewood's oversight of Hostess was the increase in management's compensation at the same time it was seeking to cut employee compensation. The Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers International Union pointed out that the company's new chief executive was paid $2,550,000, up from $750,000. Another "executive received a pay increase from $500,000 to $900,000 and another received one taking his salary from $375,000 to $656,256," the union said. Mr. Collins declined to comment.
A spokesman for Mr. Trumka said Mr. Trumka stood by his reference to Bain and pointed to a statement that he wrote on the liberal Web site Daily Kos: "It's true that the latest investors who led the company were incompetent. It's also true that they threw a lot of cash into the company, hoping to make a good flip. But the overarching issue stands - Wall Street investors destroyed an American icon and the working lives of some 18,500 families."
Frank Hurt, the president of the union that went on strike, said, "Our members are on strike because they have had enough. They are not willing to take draconian wage and benefit cuts on top of the significant concessions they made in 2004 and give up their pension so that the Wall Street vulture capitalists in control of this company can walk away with millions of dollars."
Unless a compromise is reached, Hostess's employees are likely to lose their jobs soon. And either way, Ripplewood isn't going to walk away with millions of dollars. So much for being Bained.

HEADLINE: Marco Rubio and the Age of the Earth

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: What a politician's non-answer says about the GOP and American Christianity. 

 BODY:
There has been some attention paid, predictably enough, to Florida Senator Marco Rubio's response to a GQ interviewer's question about the age of the Earth. Here are the remarks themselves:
GQ: How old do you think the Earth is?
Marco Rubio: I'm not a scientist, man. I can tell you what recorded history says, I can tell you what the Bible says, but I think that's a dispute amongst theologians and I think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States. I think the age of the universe has zero to do with how our economy is going to grow. I'm not a scientist. I don't think I'm qualified to answer a question like that. At the end of the day, I think there are multiple theories out there on how the universe was created and I think this is a country where people should have the opportunity to teach them all. I think parents should be able to teach their kids what their faith says, what science says. Whether the Earth was created in 7 days, or 7 actual eras, I'm not sure we'll ever be able to answer that. It's one of the great mysteries. 
So, a few points. First, this is pretty plainly a cautious politician's answer, not a true-believing Young-Earth Creationist's. The question has a "gotcha" edge: It drops out of the blue in the midst of the interview, and it's clearly designed to get Rubio to either take a swipe at the 40-plus percent of Americans and majority of Republican voters who doubt the evolutionary narrative about human origins (though some percentage of those doubters, it should be said, probably believe in an older-than-10,000-years Earth) or look like an anti-science rube. His answer attempts to avoid doing either: Rubio tries to be simultaneously deferential to the authority of scientists, the authority of scripture, and the authority of parents to teach their kids as they see fit. The result is a something of a muddle, but that's hardly unusual coming from a risk-averse politician, and especially a politician facing a questioner who's clearly deploying a "conservatives vs. science" framework that's itself flawed and partisan and incomplete in various ways.
However: The fact that the "conservatives vs. science" framework is frequently unfair doesn't mean that the problem doesn't exist, or that Republican politicians should just get a free pass for tiptoeing around it. No matter how you spin it, Rubio's bets-hedging non-answer isn't exactly a great indicator about the state of the party he might aspire to lead. Instead, he's contributing to the problem that the wise Jim Manzi has described as follows:
The debate about evolution is a great example of the kind of sucker play that often ensnares conservatives. Frequently, conservatives are confronted with the assertion that scientific finding X implies political or moral conclusion Y with which they vehemently disagree. Obvious examples include (X = the Modern Synthesis of Evolutionary biology, Y = atheism) and (X = increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will lead to some increase in global temperatures, Y = we must implement a global regulatory and tax system to radically reduce carbon emissions). Those conservatives with access to the biggest megaphones have recently developed the habit of responding to this by challenging the scientific finding X. The same sorry spectacle of cranks, gibberish and the resulting alienation of scientists and those who respect the practical benefits of science (i.e., pretty much the whole population of the modern world) then ensues.
In general, it would be far wiser to challenge the assertion that X implies Y. Scientific findings almost never entail specific moral or political conclusions because the scope of application of science is rarely sufficient.
As I wrote on Sunday, there are more important factors driving the Obama realignment than the supposed triumph of Reason and Progress that many liberals claim to see at work. But it's still neither politically helpful nor intellectually healthy for a minority political party to pick pointless fights with the nation's scientific and technical elite. Unless you believe that the 2016 Iowa caucuses are really, truly going to turn on the fundamentalist interpretation of Genesis (they aren't), there's no good reason why the "politician's answer" on the kind of gotcha question GQ tossed at Rubio couldn't go something more like this:
 I'm not a scientist, but I respect the scientific consensus that says that the earth is - what, something like a few billions of years old, right? I don't have any trouble reconciling that consensus with my faith. I don't think the 7 days in Genesis have to be literal 24-hour days. I don't have strong opinions about the specifics of how to teach these issues - that's for school boards to decide, and I'm not running for school board - but I think religion and science can be conversation partners, and I think kids can benefit from that conversation. 
More broadly, meanwhile, the fact that this kind of question is a "gotcha" at all is a much bigger problem for American Christianity than for Republican politicians. The goal of a political party is to win 51 percent of the vote and govern effectively, and as Rubio suggests, the ordinary work of politics can proceed even if some national politicians decline to take public views on the geological age of the earth. But the goal of Christianity is supposed to be the conversion of every human heart - yes, scientists and intellectuals included - and the central claim of Christianity is that the faith offers, not a particular political agenda or an economic program, but the true story of the world entire. The more Christians convince themselves that their faith's core is identical with the modern innovation of fundamentalism, and in direct conflict with the best available modern biology and geology, the less attainable that goal and the less tenable that central claim.
Those believers whose sensibilities Rubio was presumably trying to avoid offending would do well to meditate on the words of Saint Augustine, who like most of the greatest minds of historic Christianity insisted that biblical interpretation take place in the light of reason as well as faith:
Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of the world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics, and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn ... If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren ...
It is not Marco Rubio's task in life to solve this problem. But it is a problem, in our age even more than in Augustine's, and his answer didn't help.

HEADLINE: Down With Supercommittees

BYLINE: By PETER DIAMOND. 
Peter Diamond, a Nobel laureate in economic sciences in 2010, is an emeritus professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
CONGRESS is back in session, and the first order of business is to limit the impact of impending tax increases and budget cuts and avoid setting off a recession. Beyond that looms the unsustainable long-run debt trajectory.
Discussion of the debt trajectory is focused on some sort of grand bargain. Even if one is achieved, there's reason for pessimism: any bargain is likely to sidestep, or even enshrine, many of the root causes driving inefficiencies in our nation's spending and taxes. 
Congress, with its eyes on 2014 and beyond, can't take the risks involved with genuine reform. Limits on total spending and tax revenues are too likely to be changed by future Congresses when they are required to deal with the unspecified details needed to fit within those limits.
Instead of wide-ranging, politically motivated panels, we need narrowly targeted commissions, without sitting members of Congress, modeled on the successful Base Closure and Realignment Commissions of recent decades.
Compare the successes of five consecutive base-closing commissions, which were charged with shuttering or shrinking military facilities, and the failures of both the Simpson-Bowles Commission and the deficit ''supercommittee.''
In all of these cases, Congress recognized the difficulty in addressing an important issue, and committed itself to a no-amendments, up-or-down action on a possible commission report.
Each report from the base-closing commissions resulted in closures. In contrast, the Simpson-Bowles report did not receive enough votes to prompt Congressional action, and the supercommittee did not even finish a report.
What accounts for the different results? One key difference across these commissions was their makeup. The base-closing commissions did not include sitting members of Congress, while about two-thirds of the Simpson-Bowles commission were sitting members, including six of the seven who did not support the draft report. The supercommittee had only sitting members of Congress.
A second critical difference was the commissions' respective assignments. The base-closure commissions were given a narrow focus on military installations and a goal of more efficient government activities. For the other two commissions, the topic was a vast overhaul of the federal budget, a range so wide there was no hope of sufficiently addressing government inefficiencies.
There are simply too many moving parts for one panel to handle. For example, one much-discussed way to boost revenue is to limit total income tax deductions -- but that approach would not distinguish between deductions that were good tax policy ideas and ones that should be sharply cut back or eliminated, an enormous task in itself.
And even if a deal comes together, grand bargains reached by sitting members of Congress are likely to be revised and further watered down just as the sequester will not happen as it was legislated last August. Members of Congress are concerned with the good of the country, as they see it, and the election and re-election of themselves and members of their parties. The presence of both concerns complicates deal making and may prevent it completely.
What we need, instead, is a set of narrowly targeted commissions, each with a clearly articulated task and the ability to require a no-amendments, up-or-down vote -- and all without sitting members of Congress. Like the base-closure commissions, the panels could include former members of Congress, tax and budget experts, and representatives from the business and public-interest community.
We could create, for example, one commission to design a plan to restore balance to Social Security, one to review income tax deductions, one to review tax expenditures that target single industries and one to consider smaller programs for possible closure or merger.
Such commissions would do more than just avoid politically driven compromise. The members would look not at pointlessly large total spending and tax numbers, but specific types of spending on specific programs. Real progress on an array of programs will impress voters and the bond market more than vague promises about future budget balance that may have little credibility.
Some might worry that this approach risks creating ''smoke-filled rooms,'' in which unelected officials decide the fate of the nation. But with Congress setting the goals of the commissions and having the final say, this is no less part of the democratic process than leaving the details of the design of bridges and tunnels to engineers. And concern about the up-or-down vote will keep the commissions connected to political reality.
Let's put aside, for now, the fight over more or less government, and work for better government. We shouldn't try to settle the very real concern about the long-term debt trajectory all at once. Doing so would probably fail, and it might even leave us worse off.

HEADLINE: How Obama Can Use Pressure to Bring Peace

BYLINE: By DAN RAVIV and YOSSI MELMAN. 
Dan Raviv, a CBS News correspondent in Washington, and Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist, are the authors of ''Spies Against Armageddon: Inside Israel's Secret Wars.''

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, when Israel invaded Gaza and around 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed -- the very model of a pointless war -- Washington did nothing to offer a creative or positive path to the combatants. George W. Bush was the lamest of lame ducks, and although Barack Obama, after he was inaugurated, vowed to push for Middle East peace, he was too distracted by America's domestic problems.
Now, strengthened by his re-election, Mr. Obama should work intensively to create a pro-peace, pro-stability coalition in the region. 
He needs to put three key leaders to the test: President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
Egypt and Turkey have been trying, with Qatar, to fashion a halt to the bloodshed between Hamas and Israel. Yet a cease-fire in Gaza is only a first step.
America must now demand more of Mr. Morsi. In recognition of the billions of dollars America gives to a country now starved of tourism income, the Egyptian leader must be required to help the United States achieve its interests in the Middle East. Mr. Obama should be prepared to threaten a sharp reduction in foreign aid, unless Mr. Morsi uses his Muslim Brotherhood credentials in a positive way. The United States should not watch passively if Mr. Morsi positions himself as a great friend of the rocket-launching regime in Gaza.
That is what he did in the first days of the crisis, apparently considering it necessary to mouth stale rhetoric by condemning Israeli aggression and encouraging dreams of liberating Palestinians from Jewish control. Those are not the most helpful of words, but the test for Mr. Morsi is what he actually does during and after this crisis. He should be compelled to talk some sense into Hamas, so that the rockets stop and civilians on both sides can enjoy quiet and safety -- and not only for a few months.
If Egypt truly wants to retain its role as the leading nation in the Arab world, Mr. Morsi will have to earn it. He has to honor his country's peace treaty with Israel and crack down on terrorists in the Sinai Peninsula. He also should act strongly to stop the smuggling of weapons into Gaza, including Iranian missiles that are shipped to Sudan and then trucked through Egypt and Sinai.
Fortunately, Egypt's army would welcome a diplomatic, rather than bellicose, course. The military, which has a huge role in the country's economy and ultimately guarantees a government's ability to stay in power, wants to avoid a return to the pre-1978 days of hostility and frequent wars with Israel. Mr. Morsi, already walking a tightrope between volatile factions, would do well to please the generals and avoid fanning flames that could erupt into regional conflict.
If Mr. Morsi exerts himself, he can help bring Palestinians to the negotiating table with Israel -- at least the Fatah faction led by Mahmoud Abbas, with Hamas perhaps opting for only a tacit role.
This is Egypt's chance to impress the United States. Mr. Morsi does not need to govern his country the way the American-sponsored Hosni Mubarak used to. But working with Washington should be stressed as the only certain path to regional leadership for Egypt. The United States should insist that Mr. Morsi become the core of an active and creative coalition that promotes peace.
Turkey should also be part of that, and President Obama can easily let Mr. Erdogan claim the leading role he obviously wants in the region.
America can stand firmly behind any Turkish initiative to promote moderation and nonviolence. One obstacle is Mr. Erdogan's decision to distance his country from Israel -- most recently calling it a ''terrorist state'' -- after a long period of warm military and political ties. Now Mr. Obama should strongly encourage Turkey to mend relations with Israel, so that the two countries can covertly and overtly help each other keep wary eyes on Iran, Syria and other shared concerns.
A coalition promoting stability that includes Egypt and Turkey would also be a potent way to dent Iran's bid for regional hegemony. The United States and Israel share that aim, and so do the oil-exporting kingdoms of the Persian Gulf. They are all concerned that Iran's uranium enrichment will lead to a nuclear weapon.
That is the key to winning Mr. Netanyahu's cooperation with a new pro-peace coalition. He will not easily agree to concessions like a new freeze on building Jewish housing in the West Bank, and there is hardly any chance of his displaying flexibility until after his expected re-election on Jan. 22.
Yet very soon after Israelis vote, Mr. Obama -- having demonstrated his support during the Gaza crisis -- should begin a major effort to bring Israel on board for peace negotiations.
Iran could be the trump card. The president must convince Mr. Netanyahu that the best way to ensure American support for Israel in slowing, sabotaging or destroying Iran's nuclear program is to genuinely take part in a broad American-sponsored effort to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

HEADLINE: Case Against New York Fed In A.I.G. Rescue Is Rejected

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
A United States District Court judge dismissed a $25 billion lawsuit on Monday filed against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by Maurice Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group. 
Mr. Greenberg, who is known as Hank, accused the bank of unlawfully bailing out the insurer during the 2008 financial crisis.
The decision, issued Monday by Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan, was a ringing endorsement of broad central bank power to try to preserve the global financial system from systemic threats.
It was also a defeat for Mr. Greenberg, 87, and his Starr International Company. Before the bailout, A.I.G. was the world's largest insurer by market value and Starr was its largest shareholder, with a 12 percent stake.
''The decision vindicates the Fed at every turn,'' said David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ''It shows a willingness, now and in the future, to give the Federal Reserve extraordinary flexibility to respond to a financial crisis without a serious risk of potential legal liability.''
Starr accused the New York Fed of engineering a ''backdoor'' bailout for Wall Street banks, including the Goldman Sachs Group, at the expense of A.I.G. shareholders by forcing the insurer to unwind its bets on mortgage debt through hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps.
Starr and Mr. Greenberg sued over the bailout last November and are still suing the New York Fed in the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington, under different legal theories.
Robert Dwyer, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner who represents Mr. Greenberg, said Starr might appeal Judge Engelmayer's decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. He said the decision would not affect the Washington case.
Mr. Greenberg's office had no immediate comment.
The New York Fed said in a statement: ''We are pleased with the court's decision to dismiss this case, which we have always believed to be without merit.''
A.I.G. was bailed out on Sept. 16, 2008, one day after Lehman Brothers Holdings went bankrupt, as losses soared from the credit default swaps.
Judge Engelmayer found that the New York Fed appropriately exercised its authority to try to preserve the banking system, reduce the threat of ''grave national and international financial repercussions'' and minimize losses to the public.

HEADLINE: The Conservative Future

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
If you listened to the Republican candidates this year, you heard a conventional set of arguments. But if you go online, you can find a vibrant and increasingly influential center-right conversation. Most of the young writers and bloggers in this conversation intermingle, but they can be grouped, for clarity's sake, around a few hot spots:
Paleoconservatives. The American Conservative has become one of the more dynamic spots on the political Web. Writers like Rod Dreher and Daniel Larison tend to be suspicious of bigness: big corporations, big government, a big military, concentrated power and concentrated wealth. Writers at that Web site, and at the temperamentally aligned Front Porch Republic, treasure tight communities and local bonds. They're alert to the ways capitalism can erode community. Dispositionally, they are more Walker Percy than Pat Robertson. 
Larison focuses on what he calls the imperial tendencies of both the Bush and Obama foreign policies. He crusades against what he sees as the unchecked killing power of drone strikes and champions a more modest and noninterventionist foreign policy.
Lower-Middle Reformists. Reihan Salam, a writer for National Review, E21 and others, recently pointed out that there are two stories about where the Republican Party should go next. There is the upper-middle reform story: Republicans should soften their tone on the social issues to win over suburban voters along the coasts. Then there is a lower-middle reform story: Republicans should focus on the specific economic concerns of the multiethnic working class.
Salam promotes the latter. This means acknowledging that working-class concerns are not what they were in the 1980s. The income tax is less burdensome than the payroll tax. Family disruption undermines social mobility. Republicans, he argues, should keep the social conservatism, which reinforces families, and supplement it with an agenda that supports upward mobility and social capital.
Similarly, Henry Olsen of the American Enterprise Institute has argued for a Republican Party that listens more closely to working-class concerns. Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review has argued for family-friendly tax credits and other measures that reinforce middle-class dignity. Jim Manzi wrote a seminal article in National Affairs on the need to promote innovation while reducing inequality.
Soft Libertarians. Some of the most influential bloggers on the right, like Tyler Cowen, Alex Tabarrok and Megan McArdle, start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way.
Many of these market-oriented writers emphasize that being pro-market is not the same as being pro-business. Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago published an influential book, ''A Capitalism for the People,'' that took aim at crony capitalism. Tim Carney of The Washington Examiner does muckraking reporting on corporate-federal collusion. Rising star Derek Khanna wrote a heralded paper on intellectual property rights for the House Republican Study Committee that was withdrawn by higher-ups in the party, presumably because it differed from the usual lobbyist-driven position.
There are a number of unpredictable libertarian-leaning writers, including Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic on civil liberties issues, and Eugene Volokh on legal and free speech concerns.
Burkean Revivalists. This group includes young conservatives whose intellectual roots go back to the organic vision of society described best by Edmund Burke but who are still deeply enmeshed in current policy debates.
Yuval Levin, the editor of National Affairs is one of the two or three most influential young writers in politics today. He argues that we are now witnessing the fiscal crisis of the entitlement state, exemplified most of all by exploding health care costs. His magazine promotes a big agenda of institutional modernization.
The lawyer Adam J. White has argued for an approach to jurisprudence and regulatory affairs based on modesty, but not a doctrinaire clinging to original intent. Ryan Streeter of Indiana champions civil-society conservatism, an updated version of the Jack Kemp style.
By and large, these diverse writers did not grow up in the age of Reagan and are not trying to recapture it. They disdain what you might call Donor Base Republicanism. Most important, they matured intellectually within a far-reaching Web-based conversation. In contrast to many members of the conservative political-entertainment complex, they are data-driven, empirical and low-key in tone.
They are united more by a style of feedback and mutual scrutiny than by a common agenda. Some politically unorthodox people in this conversation, such as Josh Barro of Bloomberg View, Meghan Clyne of National Affairs and Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute, specialize in puncturing sentimentality and groupthink.
Since Nov. 6, the G.O.P. has experienced an epidemic of open-mindedness. The party may evolve quickly. If so, it'll be powerfully influenced by people with names like Reihan, Ramesh, Yuval and Derek Khanna.

HEADLINE: Easing in Cuba Renews Debate on U.S. Embargo

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
HAVANA -- ''If I could just get a lift,'' said Francisco López, imagining the addition of a hydraulic elevator as he stood by a rusted Russian sedan in his mechanic's workshop here. All he needed was an investment from his brother in Miami or from a Cuban friend there who already sneaks in brake pads and other parts for him.
The problem: Washington's 50-year-old trade embargo, which prohibits even the most basic business dealings across the 90 miles separating Cuba from the United States. Indeed, every time Mr. López's friend in Florida accepts payment for a car part destined for Cuba, he puts himself at risk of a fine of up to $65,000.
With Cuba cautiously introducing free-market changes that have legalized hundreds of thousands of small private businesses over the past two years, new economic bonds between Cuba and the United States have formed, creating new challenges, new possibilities -- and a more complicated debate over the embargo. 
The longstanding logic has been that broad sanctions are necessary to suffocate the totalitarian government of Fidel and Raúl Castro. Now, especially for many Cubans who had previously stayed on the sidelines in the battle over Cuba policy, a new argument against the embargo is gaining currency -- that the tentative move toward capitalism by the Cuban government could be sped up with more assistance from Americans.
Even as defenders of the embargo warn against providing the Cuban government with ''economic lifelines,'' some Cubans and exiles are advocating a fresh approach. The Obama administration already showed an openness to engagement with Cuba in 2009 by removing restrictions on travel and remittances for Cuban Americans. But with Fidel Castro, 86, retired and President Raúl Castro, 81, leading a bureaucracy that is divided on the pace and scope of change, many have begun urging President Obama to go further and update American policy by putting a priority on assistance for Cubans seeking more economic independence from the government.
''Maintaining this embargo, maintaining this hostility, all it does is strengthen and embolden the hard-liners,'' said Carlos Saladrigas, a Cuban exile and co-chairman of the Cuba Study Group in Washington, which advocates engagement with Cuba. ''What we should be doing is helping the reformers.''
Any easing would be a gamble. Free enterprise may not necessarily lead to the embargo's goal of free elections, especially because Cuba has said it wants to replicate the paths of Vietnam and China, where the loosening of economic restrictions has not led to political change. Indeed, Cuban officials have become adept at using previous American efforts to soften the embargo to their advantage, taking a cut of dollars converted into pesos and marking up the prices at state-owned stores.
And Cuba has a long history of tossing ice on warming relations. The latest example is the jailing of Alan Gross, a State Department contractor who has spent nearly three years behind bars for distributing satellite telephone equipment to Jewish groups in Havana.
In Washington, Mr. Gross is seen as the main impediment to an easing of the embargo, but there are also limits to what the president could do without Congressional action. The 1992 Cuban Democracy Act conditioned the waiving of sanctions on the introduction of democratic changes inside Cuba. The 1996 Helms-Burton Act also requires that the embargo remain until Cuba has a transitional or democratically elected government. Obama administration officials say they have not given up, and could move if the president decides to act on his own. Officials say that under the Treasury Department's licensing and regulation-writing authority, there is room for significant modification. Following the legal logic of Mr. Obama's changes in 2009, further expansions in travel are possible along with new allowances for investment or imports and exports, especially if narrowly applied to Cuban businesses.
Even these adjustments -- which could also include travel for all Americans and looser rules for ships engaged in trade with Cuba, according to a legal analysis commissioned by the Cuba Study Group -- would probably mean a fierce political fight. The handful of Cuban-Americans in Congress for whom the embargo is sacred oppose looser rules.
When asked about Cuban entrepreneurs who are seeking more American support, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Florida Republican who is chairwoman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, proposed an even tighter embargo.
''The sanctions on the regime must remain in place and, in fact, should be strengthened, and not be altered,'' she wrote in an e-mail. ''Responsible nations must not buy into the facade the dictatorship is trying to create by announcing 'reforms' while, in reality, it's tightening its grip on its people.''
Many Cubans agree that their government cares more about control than economic growth. Business owners complain that inspectors pounce when they see signs of success and demand receipts to prove that supplies were not stolen from the government, a common practice here. One restaurant owner in Havana said he received a large fine for failing to produce a receipt for plastic wrap.
Cuban officials say the shortages fueling the black market are caused by the embargo. But mostly they prefer to discuss the policy in familiar terms. They take reporter after reporter to hospitals of frail infants, where American medical exports are allowed under a humanitarian exception. Few companies bother, however, largely because of a rule, unique to Cuba, requiring that the American companies do on-site monitoring to make sure products are not used for weapons.
''The Treasury Department is asking me, in a children's hospital, if I use, for example, catheters for military uses -- chemical, nuclear or biological,'' said Dr. Eugenio Selman, director of the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Center.
As for the embargo's restriction on investment, Cuban officials have expressed feelings that are more mixed. At a meeting in New York in September with a group called Cuban Americans for Engagement, Cuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, said business investment was not a priority.
''Today the economic development of Cuba does not demand investments of $100,000, $200,000, $300,000,'' he said, according to the group's account of the meeting. Rather, he called for hundreds of millions of dollars to expand a local port.
Owners of Cuba's small businesses, mostly one-person operations at this point, say they know that the government would most likely find ways to profit from wider economic relations with the United States. The response to the informal imports that come from Miami in the suitcases of relatives, for instance, has been higher customs duties.
Still, in a country where Cubans ''resolve'' their way around government restrictions every day (private deals with customs agents are common), many Cubans anticipate real benefits should the United States change course. Mr. López, a meticulous mechanic who wears plastic gloves to avoid dirtying his fingers, said legalizing imports and investment would create a flood of the supplies that businesses needed, overwhelming the government's controls while lowering prices and creating more work apart from the state.
Other Cubans, including political dissidents, say softening the embargo would increase the pressure for more rapid change by undermining one of the government's main excuses for failing to provide freedom, economic opportunity or just basic supplies.
''Last month, someone asked me to redo their kitchen, but I told them I couldn't do it because I didn't have the materials,'' said Pedro José, 49, a licensed carpenter in Havana who did not want his last name published to avoid government pressure.
''Look around -- Cuba is destroyed,'' he added, waving a hand toward a colonial building blushing with circles of faded pink paint from the 1950s. ''There is a lot of work to be done.''

HEADLINE: For Tax Pledge And Its Author, A Test of Time

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Next to the oath of office, it has been perhaps the most important commitment that Republicans in Congress can make. It is called simply ''the Pledge,'' and its enforcer is such a fixture in the party that he is known simply by his first name, Grover.
Signing it means a promise never, ever to vote for a tax increase.
But the pledge and its creator, Grover Norquist, a 56-year-old conservative lobbyist, have never before faced a test as they do now. The federal deficit stands at $1 trillion. The social safety net continues to grow -- and, in the case of Medicare and Social Security, remains hugely popular. And unless the two parties can agree on a fiscal plan before Jan. 1, hundreds of billions of dollars of tax increases will go into effect automatically, meaning that Congress does not even need to act for taxes to rise. 
The combination means that Mr. Norquist, whose long record of success is a rarity in Washington, finds himself in a tricky spot. Some top Republicans, including Speaker John A. Boehner, are saying they now agree with Democrats that the government must collect more tax revenue. Others have gone so far as to break with Mr. Norquist publicly.
By Mr. Norquist's count, 219 House members -- enough for a majority -- and 39 senators have committed to the pledge. But some of those members who signed on, many of them years ago, have started to back away, apparently leaving him several votes shy of the majority he would need to block any tax increase.
''A pledge is good at the time you sign it,'' said Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican whose name still appears as a pledge signer on the Web site of Mr. Norquist's group, Americans for Tax Reform. ''In 1941, I would have voted to declare war on Japan. But each Congress is a new Congress. And I don't think you can have a rule that you're never going to raise taxes or that you're never going to lower taxes. I don't want to rule anything out.''
Mr. Norquist contends that every few years, several noisy Republicans say their support is squishy. Yet every time, he says proudly, the outcome is the same.
''It's been 22 years since a Republican voted for a tax increase in this town,'' he said in a recent interview. ''This is not my first rodeo.''
Ask Republicans in Congress today what they think of the pledge, and many of them say that while they still subscribe to a low-tax view of government, they resent being hamstrung by a piece of paper they signed well before they were elected. Some of them are even saying they want out.
''I'm frankly not concerned about the Norquist pledge,'' Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia said last week.
Senator John McCain noted with a certain sense of satisfaction at an Atlantic magazine forum last week that ''fewer and fewer people are signing this, quote, pledge.''
Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, at the same forum, said that with the federal debt at $16 trillion, closing tax loopholes and eliminating deductions have to be considered, ''even though that may technically violate the pledge.'' He added, ''Sign me up.''
Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma has called the pledge a ''tortured vision of tax purity.''
Ted Yoho, who will represent part of northern Florida when the new House convenes in January, said: ''I'll pledge allegiance to the flag. I'll pledge to be faithful to my wife.'' But he is one of a handful of House newcomers who declined to sign to Mr. Norquist's pledge and likened it to a New Year's resolution that many others will break.
Mr. Norquist claims to have invented the idea for a no-new-taxes promise when he was a 12-year-old volunteer for Richard M. Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign.
He is fond of evocative metaphors, like claiming he wants to reduce government ''down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.'' Not honoring the pledge would cause grave damage to the Republican brand, he has said, likening it to a Coke can with a rat head in the bottom.
The walls at the headquarters of his interest group are covered with signed copies from conservative heroes like Newt Gingrich, who warns Republicans to stick to their guns. Mr. Gingrich, like Mr. Norquist, argues that the pledge protects Republicans from agreeing to stealth tax increases that ultimately hurt them.
''Every time I've watched Republicans try to be clever with Democrats on issues of taxation,'' Mr. Gingrich said last week, ''Democrats have won.''
In the current talks with President Obama, Republicans have signaled an openness to increasing tax revenue by reducing deductions and credits, as long as income tax rates do not rise. That would still violate the pledge, which states that ''any and all efforts'' to increase taxes are inexcusable.
Some Republicans have decided that they no longer like the lack of flexibility. ''Basically the pledge is like a Master lock,'' said Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia, who in January became one of the first freshmen to publicly renounce the pledge.
When Mr. Rigell announced his reversal, he braced for the consequences. Instead, he said, the word he received was a text message from his local Republican Party chairman saying, ''Thanks for your courage.'' Yet Mr. Norquist still includes Mr. Rigell's name on his list of pledge signers.
Obama administration officials and other Democrats argue that Mr. Norquist's pledge is doomed because Republicans will eventually need to square their budget policies with public opinion. With society aging and modern medicine developing new treatments, health care costs will continue to rise.
Voters express strong support for Medicare and Social Security and for raising taxes on the affluent, Democrats note. Over all, federal tax revenue has taken up a smaller share of gross domestic product in the last few years than at any point since the 1950s. One possibility is that the pledge will survive on a technicality. If Congress fails to reach a resolution before the tax cuts passed during the George W. Bush administration expire at midnight on Dec. 31, rates will revert to their higher pre-2001 levels. If Congress then approved a bill that restored only some of those lower rates but not, for example, ones for the highest income brackets, Republicans could still claim to be within the bounds of their pledge.
But Mr. Norquist argues that history suggests the pledge will survive on more than a technicality. Republicans, he said, have always come around, even if it takes a little pressure.
When he hears about someone wavering on the pledge, he has a simple routine, he says. ''Every time this happens, I call the guy and say: 'I just want to make sure we're on the same page. I don't want to have an argument,' '' he said. ''But if you really want to raise taxes, I do want to have an argument.''

HEADLINE: Albion at the E.U. Exit Door

BYLINE: By CHARLES A. KUPCHAN

 BODY:
STORM clouds are darkening over Britain's relationship with the European Union. Prime Minister David Cameron is backing away from the Union, ostensibly seeking to fashion the more distant relationship between London and Brussels needed to keep the U.K. in the E.U. But he may well be putting in motion a political process that will culminate in Britain's exit from Europe.
That outcome would deal a serious blow to European solidarity, deny the E.U. the valuable role that London continues to play in guiding economic integration and the enlargement of the Union, and shake the foundations of the trans-Atlantic alliance. 
Before Britain's self-isolation becomes irreversible, Europeans and Americans alike had better face up to the potential consequences of the U.K.'s growing estrangement from the E.U.
Britain has long kept its European neighbors at arm's length. The British empire banked on ''splendid isolation,'' relying on the English Channel as a buffer against continental entanglement. London initially stood apart from the project of European integration started after World War II. Britain finally joined the European Community in 1973, but has since opted out of the euro zone and other collective initiatives. Protecting British sovereignty from the encroachments of ''Eurocrats'' in Brussels has consistently served as a political call to arms.
This longstanding discomfort about getting too close to Europe now appears to be morphing into a dangerous stampede for the exit. The Parliament recently voted down Cameron's already stingy proposal on the E.U. budget. Pressed by Euro-skeptics in his own party, Cameron is edging toward committing to a popular referendum on membership in the E.U. (Recent polls reveal that 48 percent of voters favor withdrawal, with 31 percent against).
Cameron himself favors Britain's continued membership in the E.U., but only if the country is able to negotiate a more attenuated relationship. He wants to consolidate a ''two-speed'' E.U. in which members outside the euro zone would contribute less to the Union budget and form their own caucus. He has also indicated that his government will repatriate control of key aspects of social policy and law enforcement from Brussels.
These moves are meant to provide the British the breathing room they need to stay put in the E.U. But rather than consolidating Britain's place in the E.U., Cameron's course is likely to precipitate its defection. Of Europe's 27 members, 10 are outside the euro zone. Most of Britain's companions in this outer circle, however, plan to eventually join the euro zone, which would leave Britain as the odd man out -- absent from what will become the E.U.'s main decision-making venue. The British would hardly countenance remaining in a Union in which their voice would be so marginalized.
Britain is also set to pay a heavy economic price for standing aloof. The euro zone is fashioning banking and fiscal unions that would give Europe's single market an integrated financial sector. London's position as one of the world's financial centers could be undermined as bankers and traders move to the euro zone to take advantage of its common rules and single currency. Britain's hostility toward the E.U. would only mount.
Britain's drift from Europe is also a geopolitical dead end. Britain has long served as a bridge between the United States and Europe, but London cannot remain an important partner on matters of European defense should it become a bit player within the E.U. Britain would resign itself to a no-man's-land if it abandoned its attachment to the E.U., weakening the Union as well as Europe's tether to the United States.
An irrelevant Britain and an enfeebled E.U. do not augur well for a trans-Atlantic bond central to the defense of Western values and interests. As America's own defense budget shrinks and those of China and other emerging powers rise, Washington sorely needs capable allies. Britain's departure from Europe would mean that the U.K., as well as Europe as a whole, gradually slip off America's radar screen.
If the British, well aware of the likely consequences, still decide to turn their backs on Europe, so be it. But they should at least head down that path with eyes wide open.

HEADLINE: Cash-Short Europe Takes Aim at the Moon

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- Forty years after humans last walked on the Moon, Europe's space industry is hoping to play a key role in the resumption of manned lunar exploration planned for later this decade. But whether cash-strapped governments are prepared to pay for out-of-this-world projects remains unclear.
Science ministers from the 20 member states of the European Space Agency gather Tuesday in Naples for a two-day meeting where they will be asked to approve a budget of up to &#x20ac;12 billion, or $15.3 billion, for the next three years that would include financing for dozens of programs, including a new lunar crew transport vehicle, at least two Mars exploration missions and a successor to Europe's highly successful Ariane 5 rocket. 
By comparison, the U.S. space agency, NASA, had a budget of $18 billion for the 2012 fiscal year.
''I am not living on a different planet,'' Jean-Jacques Dordain, the E.S.A.'s director general, said in an interview at the agency's headquarters here. ''I know the difficulties of people. I read the newspapers. The economic situation will have an impact.''
Until the global economic crisis struck four years ago, the E.S.A. had been able to count on steady increases to its annual budget, which today stands at just over &#x20ac;4 billion. But industry executives predict that the fiscal and deficit pact forged this year to save the euro will most likely require several member states to reduce their financing of space programs. Mr. Dordain said he hoped the ministers in Naples would approve a budget of at least &#x20ac;10 billion through 2015 -- an average of &#x20ac;3.3 billion a year.
The E.S.A.'s origins date from the late 1960s as the European countries with significant space expertise -- particularly Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- began to fear being left behind as the United States and Soviet Union channeled enormous financial and technological resources into their Cold War space race. The agency receives three-fourths of its budget directly from member states and the rest from the European Union and a handful of cooperating states.
In Europe, more than 30,000 people are directly employed by the space industry and a further 300,000 people work in space-related sectors like satellite operations and an array of navigation, communications and Earth observation services.
Part of Mr. Dordain's mission this week will be to reassure governments that the often high upfront costs of the E.S.A.'s projects, which focus heavily on developing and launching satellites for earth observation and telecommunications, deliver tangible gains for European businesses. The European Union estimates, for example, that the &#x20ac;5 billion Galileo satellite navigation system -- a competitor to the Global Positioning System of the United States -- will generate &#x20ac;90 billion in economic benefits over the next 20 years.
European companies have a 40 percent share of the global market in commercial satellite launchings, and economists say the revenue they generate is roughly 20 times the cost of the launchings themselves.
Space investment, Mr. Dordain said, ''is not the man on the moon -- it is down to earth.'' While the E.S.A. has always made its main priority the pursuit of knowledge about the Earth and the solar system, the current crisis has added another: leveraging space investments to enhance the competitiveness of European companies.
It is a message, he said, that some European governments are coming to grasp. This month, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced plans to increase London's contribution to the E.S.A.'s budget by 25 percent over the next two years. The larger contribution is expected to translate into more research contracts for British companies, the fruits of which could be commercialized into new products and services.
Even the most audacious space-exploration missions have yielded technologies that have later found earthbound applications in areas like mobile communications, optics, robotics, energy generation and propulsion systems. That remains the main argument for continued European participation in projects like the International Space Station and forthcoming missions to the Moon, Mars and Mercury.
Perhaps the most ambitious project on Mr. Dordain's wish list is a &#x20ac;450 million proposal to build, together with NASA, a space vehicle that would transport up to four astronauts on missions as long as six months. Its first mission, envisioned for around 2020, would bring the first humans to the Moon since the U.S. Apollo space program ended in 1972. The spacecraft could be modified in later years for manned missions to Mars or one of the asteroids.
Other proposals on the table this week include &#x20ac;100 million to finance the first phase of development for a robotic lander that would explore the Moon's south pole, which some scientists believe may harbor ancient deposits of ice. An initial feasibility study for the lander was awarded in 2010 to Astrium, a unit of European Aeronautic Defense & Space.
''I have more ideas than member states have money,'' Mr. Dordain said.
A rocket scientist who has trained as an astronaut, Mr. Dordain, 66, was in primary school when the Soviet Union lofted Sputnik in 1957. He earned his engineering degree on July 20, 1969, the day Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon.
While he continues to press the case for space investment to European leaders, he concedes that it is impossible to put a price tag on the thrill of exploration that inspired his own career -- and that the E.S.A. aims to harness by encouraging young Europeans to become scientists and engineers.
''You cannot put an economic value on providing dreams,'' he said.

To the Editor:
''Scientists Hope Obama Continues Support for Basic Research'' (Nov. 13) correctly characterized the wait-and-see attitude of many scientists and engineers as sweeping budget cuts threaten research and development -- the engine of economic progress. Broad cuts will cripple American science unless Congress and the president agree by January to a debt-reduction plan. Sequestration would slash science funding by 8.4 percent over five years. That would devastate agencies, states and efforts to address disease, energy independence and more. The National Institutes of Health could lose $11.3 billion to $26.1 billion over five years. 
Countries such as China and South Korea are more rapidly increasing their science investments. Hope is not enough. Every scientist, and anyone else who cares about future prosperity and quality of life, must speak up for science now. Other fiscal interests have not been quiet.

HEADLINE: Strong Reports Lift Wall St. To a Second Straight Rally

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a second consecutive session on Monday as investors were encouraged by the early atmosphere surrounding talks to address the nation's fiscal problems.
Stronger-than-expected earnings from Lowe's and Tyson Foods, as well as encouraging housing data, contributed to the market's advance. Tyson and Lowe's were the top two percentage gainers on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
The S.& P. 500 is up more than 2 percent in the last two sessions as talk from legislators over the weekend suggested that a deal can be reached to stave off the looming series of tax and spending changes that will begin to take effect in the new year. The two sides are still far apart in negotiations, however.
The benchmark S.& P. index had fallen 5.3 percent from Election Day to the rebound on Friday, as investors took the opportunity to sell stocks -- including some of the year's best performers -- just in case Washington could not come to an agreement and taxes on dividends and capital gains rose in 2013.
''Everyone is quietly breathing a sigh of relief, because frankly, we are no longer looking over the edge of a cliff, we are looking at an opportunity to step back and recalibrate,'' said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City.
However, the rebound could be short-lived and market volatility could still rise, depending on progress in negotiations. A number of sectors were considered oversold on a technical basis -- suggesting a buying opportunity.
The lift on Monday was the biggest percentage gain for the S.& P. 500 since Nov. 6, when the European Central Bank announced a bond-buying program to combat the region's debt crisis.
Shares of Lowe's, the world's No. 2 home improvement chain, after Home Depot, jumped 6.2 percent, to $33.96, to hit a 52-week high after the company reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year sales forecast.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 207.65 points, or 1.65 percent, to close at 12,795.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 27.01 points, or 1.99 percent, at 1,386.89. The Nasdaq composite index was up 62.94 points, or 2.21 percent, at 2,916.07.
Tyson Foods beat expectations and gave an upbeat forecast, sending its stock up 10.9 percent, to $18.72.
Intel's shares edged higher, up 0.3 percent to $20.25 after the company said its chief executive would retire in May.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 8/32, to 100 4/32, and the yield rose to 1.61 percent, from 1.58 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Gaza Crisis Poses Threat To Faction Favored by U.S.

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
RAMALLAH, West Bank -- In the daily demonstrations here of solidarity with Gaza, a mix of sympathy and anguish, there is something else: growing identification with the Islamist fighters of Hamas and derision for the Palestinian Authority, which Washington considers the only viable partner for peace with Israel.
''Strike a blow on Tel Aviv!'' proclaimed the lyrics of a new hit song blasting from shops and speakers at Monday's demonstration, in a reference to Hamas rockets that made it nearly to Israel's economic and cultural capital. ''Don't let the Zionists sleep! We don't want a truce or a solution! Oh, Palestinians, you can be proud!''
Pop songs everywhere are filled with bravado and aggression. But this one reflects a widespread sentiment that does not augur well for President Mahmoud Abbas and his Palestinian Authority, which is rapidly losing credibility, even relevance. The Gaza truce talks in Cairo, involving Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, offer a telling tableau. The Palestinian leader seen there is not Mr. Abbas, but Khaled Meshal, the leader of the militant group Hamas, who seeks to speak for all Palestinians as his ideological brothers in the Muslim Brotherhood rise to power around the region. 
Israel is also threatening Mr. Abbas, even hinting that it may give up on him, as he prepares to go to the United Nations General Assembly on Nov. 29 to try to upgrade the Palestinian status to that of a nonmember state. The Israelis consider this step an act of aggression, and even some Palestinians say it is somewhat beside the point at this stage.
''His people are being killed in Gaza, and he is sitting on his comfortable chair in Ramallah,'' lamented Firas Katash, 20, a student who took part in the Ramallah demonstration.
For the United States, as for other countries hoping to promote a two-state solution to this century-old conflict, a more radicalized West Bank with a discredited Palestinian Authority would mean greater insecurity for Israel and increased opportunity for anti-Western forces to take root in a region where Islamism is on the rise.
Since Hamas, which won parliamentary elections in 2006, threw the Fatah-controlled authority out of Gaza a year later, Mr. Abbas has not set foot there. Yet he will be asking the world to recognize the two increasingly distinct entities as a unified state.
Manar Wadi, who works in an office in Ramallah, put the issue this way: ''What is happening in Gaza makes the Palestinian Authority left behind and isolated. Now we see the other face of Hamas, and its popularity is rising. It makes us feel that the Palestinian Authority doesn't offer a path to the future.''
In Cairo on Monday, Mr. Meshal seemed defiant and confident in his new role, daring the Israelis to invade Gaza as a sixth day of Israeli aerial assaults brought the death toll there to more than 100 people, many of them militants of Hamas and its affiliates. Rockets launched from Gaza hit southern Israel, causing some damage and panic, but no casualties, leaving the death toll there at three.
''Whoever started the war must end it,'' Mr. Meshal said at a news conference. ''If Israel wants a cease-fire brokered through Egypt, then that is possible. Escalation is also possible.''
Officials in the authority have been holding leadership meetings, staying in close touch with the talks in Cairo and issuing statements of solidarity. They have also sent a small medical delegation to Gaza and argue that there is a new opportunity to forge unity between the two feuding movements. But they are acutely aware of their problem.
''The most dangerous thing is the fact that what we could not do in negotiations, Hamas did with one rocket,'' one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''The people had such excitement seeing the occupiers run in panic. It's a very dangerous message.''
Mr. Abbas, whose popularity has been on the decline as the Palestinian Authority faces economic difficulty and growing Israeli settlements, also ran into trouble not long before the Gaza fighting began when he seemed to give up on the Palestinian demand of a right of return to what is now Israel.
Many Palestinians believe that Israel launched its latest operation in Gaza to block the Palestinian Authority's United Nations plans by embarrassing it. Israeli officials say that is ridiculous: the operation's purpose is to stop the growing number of rockets being fired at their communities, and Israelis interrupted their deliberations over the United Nations bid to wage the military campaign.
But Israel says anything that does not involve direct negotiations is a waste of time. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly threatened to take severe retaliatory steps against the Palestinian Authority, including cutting off badly needed tax receipts to Palestinian coffers, should Mr. Abbas go ahead at the United Nations.
In a speech here on Sunday night at a Palestinian leadership meeting, Mr. Abbas repeated his determination to go to New York and ask for a change in status to that of nonmember state. He has chosen the symbolically significant date of Nov. 29, when the General Assembly voted in 1947 to divide this land into two states, one Jewish and the other Palestinian Arab.
The United States has asked Mr. Abbas not to do so, but instead to resume direct negotiations with Israel, which have essentially been frozen since 2008.
Mr. Abbas and his prime minister, Salam Fayyad, are viewed in the West -- and by some Israelis -- as the most moderate and serious Palestinian partners ever to lead the Palestinian national movement. But Mr. Netanyahu's government increasingly disagrees and says that the Palestinian Authority is losing any significance in its calculations.
''I think what stands out from this event is the irrelevance of Abu Mazen,'' Moshe Yaalon, the minister of strategic affairs, said on Monday, using the name by which Mr. Abbas is widely known. ''He's only relevant for declarations and for unilateral steps to seek recognition at the U.N.''
Another senior Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity so he could talk candidly, said of Mr. Abbas: ''He cannot even visit his own territory in Gaza. How can the states that will vote for Palestinian statehood plan on giving him recognition? The most basic element of statehood is control of your territory. This is the theater of the absurd.''
The Palestinian Authority maintains well-trained police and military forces that keep order in the West Bank, and it promotes economic growth within the confines of the occupation, leading to some business activity. These are functions Israel would otherwise have to carry out itself, and it has been widely argued that Israel will make every effort to keep the authority functioning.
But the senior official said that view is fading in the government. He said that Mr. Netanyahu is not yet ready to call it quits with the authority but that some around him are. ''The number of ministers who say we must keep the Palestinian Authority alive is decreasing rapidly,'' he said. ''More and more ministers today see the Palestinian Authority as a strategic threat.''
Robert M. Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and a former senior State Department official, said Israel has contributed to Hamas's rise in stature by holding it responsible for rocket fire from more radical groups in Gaza.
''In calling upon Egypt to rein in the Gaza leaders, Hamas's centrality grows rather than diminishes,'' Mr. Danin said. ''It is this that draws leaders from throughout the Middle East rushing to Gaza while skipping Ramallah to court the Hamas leadership. Yet by bypassing Ramallah and President Abbas, they further marginalize the moderate leaders as the proper address for resolving problems.''
There are Palestinians who say that the Israeli operation in Gaza will strengthen unity efforts between the authority and Hamas because it shows how vulnerable all Palestinians are and how much they need shared strength. Officially, Hamas accepts Mr. Abbas's United Nations plan, but some in the West Bank suspect it will ultimately undermine it in a power struggle.
''The Palestinian Authority is making a last-ditch effort to save the political paradigm of two states by going to the U.N.,'' said Sam Bahour, an American-Palestinian businessman. ''It is the only alternative to violence. The problem is that people view the Palestinian Authority as being incompetent to do anything. And the Israelis are making it worse. Increasingly, the Hamas agenda and the Israeli one seem to be the same on this point -- derailing the Palestinian leadership.''

HEADLINE: Following a Princess's Lead, to College

BYLINE: By JULIE TURKEWITZ

 BODY:
At Sarah Lawrence College, Jesse Fuentes is at home in her silver-colored combat boots, the ones she uses to scale difficult terrain: the rocks at Soundview Park in the Bronx, outdoor subway beams across the city, the often slippery hills on her idyllic college campus.
''Anything that I can climb,'' she said, ''I'll try to climb it.''
At 18, she has made it startlingly high. At that age, her father, Bonfilio, was trekking across Mexico, making his living as a day laborer. Her mother, Honorina, was caring for a sick parent and a covey of younger siblings. As children, both woke each morning in homes common in Mexico: a dirt floor, a concrete roof and rebar shooting toward the sky, waiting for the day there might be money for another story.
In 1984, Mr. Fuentes set off for the Bronx, a 24-year-old man called by adventure and the prospect of higher pay. But his heart remained tethered to Honorina, whom he had met in Mexico, and he soon went back to marry her. He returned to the United States, then sent for his wife. Eventually, both became American citizens. 
They made a home in Mr. Fuentes's one-bedroom apartment on Ward Avenue in the Bronx. In 1994, Jesse was born -- and soon her parents realized they had an intellectual force in their midst. When Jesse was 3, her mother taught her to read. She progressed rapidly in school, rarely studying.
While Mr. Fuentes worked in restaurants across the city, Ms. Fuentes stayed home to take care of Jesse. They also shielded her from the economic hardships of immigrant life. ''I don't think she ever felt 'in need' as the only child of a small, hard-working family,'' said Emily Task, a college counselor who worked closely with the family. ''She felt very provided for.''
In middle school, Ms. Fuentes discovered the fiction series ''The Princess Diaries,'' and lost herself in the adventures of Mia Thermopolis, a character who, in Volume 10, is accepted to a tree-lined paradise for rebels and brainiacs, Sarah Lawrence. A seed was planted.
Jesse Fuentes earned straight A's at Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School, in the South Bronx, a school where all students receive lunch free or at a reduced cost, and at least 10 percent are still learning English. There, Ms. Fuentes began teaching herself Japanese using podcasts. She also began to define her values: She is a feminist, but strongly against abortion; she is a religious skeptic, but believes in a higher being.
Teachers were sometimes intimidated by of her. ''The in-class Jesse was often the student who really challenged the teacher,'' Ms. Task said. ''She took everything that she knew and really saw the teacher as an equal.''
With the help of the Children's Aid Society, one of the agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Ms. Fuentes went through a rigorous college preparation program. In her senior year, she was accepted at Sarah Lawrence; if she could combine scholarships with student loans and work-study, it looked as if she would be headed for the green expanses and academic challenges of a campus in southern Westchester County.
But Ms. Fuentes soon learned she would need a $400 deposit to secure her space. Around the same time, her uncle died, and her widowed aunt needed money. ''It's Mexican culture that when something like that happens, the family unites,'' Ms. Fuentes said. ''The point is, even though we do not always have money, we'll pretend that we have money. And if you need it, we'll find a way to get it and give it to you.''
Mr. Fuentes, who works at a KFC restaurant, earns $1,693 a month, a figure just above the poverty line; the family's rent is $650. He had not expected to help the aunt, or to pay the $400 deposit. Suddenly, a carefully orchestrated future lay in limbo.
''I didn't want to lose my spot in Sarah Lawrence,'' Ms. Fuentes said, ''which was my top choice and I really wanted to attend. I was panicking that I wouldn't be able to attend college at all because of this.''
Then Ms. Task, the college counselor, stepped in. She is employed by the Children's Aid Society and helped Ms. Fuentes apply for $250 from the Neediest Cases Fund to cover part of the deposit. Ms. Fuentes paid the $150 balance using a scholarship.
In September, the Fuenteses dropped off their daughter at college. Since then, Ms. Fuentes has wrapped her new twin bed in bright pink sheets. Her purple guitar rests against the wall; Nabokov and Chomsky sit side by side on her desk.
Ms. Fuentes is not sure what her future will look like, but she wants it to involve travel, languages, education and anthropology. She said she was following less in the footsteps of Mia Thermopolis, and more in the path of her father, a broad-minded thinker who always carries a novel in his back pocket.
''When I was really young, my dad would sit down with me and talk,''she said.
''I would ask a question,'' she added, ''and he would always have answers for me.''

HEADLINE: Holding Back Floodwaters With a Balloon

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- With a few dull thuds, the one-ton bag of high-strength fabric tumbled from the wall of the mock subway tunnel and onto the floor. Then it began to grow.
As air flowed into it through a hose, the bundle inflated until it was crammed tight inside the 16-foot-diameter tunnel, looking like the filling in a giant concrete-and-steel cannoli.
The three-minute procedure, conducted on a chilly morning this month in an airport hangar not far from West Virginia University, was the latest test of a device that may someday help guard real tunnels during disasters -- whether a terrorist strike or a storm like Hurricane Sandy, whose wind-driven surge of water overwhelmed New York City's subway system, shutting it down for days.
''The goal is to provide flooding protection for transportation tunnels,'' said John Fortune, who is managing the project for the federal Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate. 
The idea is a simple one: rather than retrofitting tunnels with metal floodgates or other expensive structures, the project aims to use a relatively cheap inflatable plug to hold back floodwaters.
In theory, it would be like blowing up a balloon inside a tube. But in practice, developing a plug that is strong, durable, quick to install and foolproof to deploy is a difficult engineering task, one made even more challenging because of the pliable, relatively lightweight materials required.
''Water is heavy, there's a lot of pressure,'' said Greg Holter, an engineer with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory who helps manage the project. ''So it's not as simple as just inflating and filling the space. The plug has to be able to withstand the pressure of the water behind it.''
The idea has been in development for more than five years -- this test was the 21st -- and Dr. Fortune says there are at least a few more years of testing and design work ahead. If the plugs are shown to be effective, they will be made available to transit systems around the country; at least initially, they are expected to cost about $400,000 each.
''We have frequent conversations with folks in mass transit agencies, the true experts in the field, on how this would be deployed,'' Dr. Fortune said, although he declined to name specific agencies, citing the antiterrorism aspect of the project.
Adam Lisberg, the chief spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York City's transit systems, said the damage caused by the storm ''is certainly going to focus our attention'' on ways to protect the subways. ''But it's way too early to talk about any particular technology that's been proposed,'' he said.
In all, seven of the city's 14 under-river subway tunnels were flooded during the storm, as were several major highway tunnels. Dr. Fortune said that plugs might work for highway tunnels, too, but that the larger size of those tunnels created additional technical challenges that would have to be overcome.
Work on the plug began in 2007, after Ever J. Barbero, a West Virginia professor whose specialty is the use of advanced materials in engineering, was contacted by a Homeland Security official looking for outside-the-box ideas on ways to keep a subway system from flooding if an underwater tunnel were breached -- by a terrorist bomb, for example.
''I didn't know anything about this,'' he said. ''Then I found out what happened in Chicago.''
Dr. Barbero was referring to a 1992 episode in which an abandoned freight tunnel under the Chicago River was breached by a crew sinking bridge pilings. That led to a flood that caused close to $2 billion in damage to downtown buildings as the water spread underground.
Dr. Barbero came up with an idea and shared it with Homeland Security officials. ''I said, 'We'll put an air bag in a tunnel,' '' he recalled. The department was intrigued -- officials were familiar with European efforts to develop plugs to seal tunnels from gas and smoke after a series of deadly tunnel fires -- and decided to finance the project. About $8 million has been spent so far.
Dr. Barbero realized that the forces exerted on the pressurized plug, and the need to rely on friction against the tunnel walls to keep it in place under the onslaught of floodwaters, meant that it had to be made from very tough materials. Experts from ILC Dover, a company in Delaware that makes high-strength soft structures like spacesuits and the force-absorbing air bags used for some of the Mars rover landings, suggested fabric made from Vectran, a strong but lightweight yarn spun from a liquid-crystal polymer.
But the first full-scale plug, made with a single layer of Vectran, failed during a pressure test in 2010. ''It ripped right down the middle, from back to front,'' Dr. Fortune said.
So Dr. Barbero and ILC came up with a three-layer plug, with the outer layer consisting of woven Vectran belts. It is designed so that the tearing of one belt will not cause a catastrophic failure.
''It took time to figure out how to make it work with such huge pressure,'' Dr. Barbero said. ''But it also took time for the team to understand how a subway works, what are the constraints in the tunnels.''
A subway tunnel is hardly a pristine environment; it is full of grease and grime -- and, often, rats.
''That's something we've talked about,'' Dr. Fortune said. ''We've actually put Vectran samples in tunnels, to see if rats ate it. They didn't.''
There are also obstructions like tracks, as well an electrified third rail, pipes and safety walkways, all of which could cause gaps between the plug and the tunnel walls. Most of the obstructions can be dealt with by modifying a short section of the tunnel to accommodate the plug, which is 32 feet long when inflated. Sharp corners can be curved, flush tracks of the type used at grade crossings can be installed, the third rail can be discontinued for a stretch, and pipes can be made to swing against the ceiling.
Those modifications will reduce potential gaps but not eliminate them. In the most recent test, when Dr. Barbero and a colleague, Eduardo Sosa, inspected the front of the plug, they discovered a two-inch gap in one corner. The procedure called for filling the plug with water to pressurize it further, and then introducing water behind it to simulate a flood. But a plumbing failure, unrelated to the plug, ended the test prematurely. It was repeated successfully several days later, Dr. Fortune said, and the plug held back all but a small amount of water.
Dr. Fortune said that was the goal of the design: to keep the inevitable gaps small enough that any water that made it through could be easily pumped out. ''The idea is that in a real-life situation, you reduce unmanageable to manageable,'' he said.
Placement of the plugs would vary depending on a transit agency's particular needs, Dr. Fortune said. Since water pressure increases with depth, shallower placement would make it easier for a plug to hold back floodwaters. And while a plug at either end of an underwater tube would protect against a tunnel breach, Hurricane Sandy showed that flooding can occur in many other ways -- through ventilation grates and station entrances, for example. So in a system like New York's, there may be other strategic places to install plugs.
''The positioning of the plug and potential sources of leakage all come into play in considering how to use these things,'' Dr. Fortune said.
Dr. Barbero's initial idea was to put plugs on rail cars so that they could be sent to any location, as needed. ''That sounded really far-fetched'' to Homeland Security officials, he recalled. He came up with a more permanent installation: the plug sits, folded up, inside a long container snug against a tunnel wall, out of the way of passing trains.
Pumps and other equipment are even farther out of the way. On a signal, the container opens up like a parachute bag, and the plug unfolds and inflates.
As with a parachute, proper folding is critical. ''If you fold it wrong, it won't come out right,'' Dr. Barbero said. The procedure involves laying the plug flat and folding it in on itself, to avoid wrinkles that might cause a very large gap.
''It's a pancake, and then it becomes a burrito,'' he said.
One of the reasons it has been tested so often is to ensure that it will unfold properly every time. ''This is something like the air bag in your car,'' Dr. Barbero said. ''You depend on it. You don't think about it. You never use it, probably. But if you need it, it's got to be there, and it better work.''

HEADLINE: By One Notch, Moody's Lowers France's Sovereign Debt Rating

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service downgraded France's sovereign debt rating by one notch, to Aa1 from Aaa, the agency said on Monday, citing the country's uncertain fiscal outlook as a result of ''deteriorating economic prospects.'' 
In addition, Moody's said it was maintaining a negative outlook on France because of structural challenges and a ''sustained loss of competitiveness'' in the country.
Standard & Poor's has an AA-plus rating and negative outlook on France, which it downgraded by one notch in January, from AAA.
Fitch Ratings has France at AAA, also with a negative outlook.
The loss of the Aaa rating from two agencies poses a problem for France, as investment funds often require their best assets to have a minimum of two top-notch ratings to remain in their portfolios.
On top of this, borrowing costs could rise for France given that it is now not considered as strong a credit risk as before, although the country's rating is still very high.
''I'm not surprised for two reasons: Rating agencies are trying to beat each other at downgrading everybody, but secondly, simply because France is paying the price for not engaging in reform,'' said Axel Merk, president of Merk Investments in Palo Alto, Calif.
''The question is whether it is a wake-up call, or not, and I don't think so; the French are too proud.
''Some metrics in France have been deteriorating a tad but not enough for stubborn politicians to change course,'' Mr. Merk said.

HEADLINE: Vetoing Business as Usual After the Storm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Not a month after Hurricane Sandy there's a rough consensus about how to respond. America is already looking to places like London, Rotterdam, Hamburg and Tokyo, where sea walls, levees and wetlands, flood plains and floating city blocks have been conceived.
New York clearly ought to have taken certain steps a while back, no-brainers after the fact. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority ought to have installed floodgates and louvers at vulnerable subway entrances and vents. Consolidated Edison should have gotten its transformers, and Verizon its switching stations, out of harm's way, and Congress should have ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to study the impact of giant barriers to block parts of the city from the sea.
Scientists, architects, planners and others have, of course, been mulling over these issues for years. They've pressed for more parkland and bike lanes, green roofs and energy-efficient buildings, and warned about the need for backup generators, wetland edges along Lower Manhattan and barrier islands for the harbor to cushion the blow of rushing tides. 
Hurricane Sandy was a toll paid for procrastination. The good news? We don't need to send a bunch of Nobel laureates into the desert now, hoping they come up with some new gizmo to save the planet. Solutions are at hand. Money shouldn't be a problem either, considering the hundreds of billions of dollars, and more lives, another Sandy or two will cost.
So the problem is not technological or, from a long-term cost-benefit perspective, financial.
Rather it is the existential challenge to the messy democracy we've devised. The hardest part of what lies ahead won't be deciding whether to construct Eiffel Tower-size sea walls across the Verrazano Narrows and Hell Gate, or overhauling the city's sewage and storm water system, which spews toxic waste into rivers whenever a couple of inches of rain fall because the sea levels have already risen so much. These are monumental tasks.
But more difficult still will be staring down the pain, dislocation and inequity that promise to upend lives, undo communities and shake assumptions about city life and society. More than requiring the untangling of colossal red tape, saving New York and the whole region for the centuries ahead will become a test of civic unity.
In New York last week to tour the damage, President Obama named Shaun Donovan, his secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a New Yorker and former housing official in the city, to spearhead federal recovery efforts. Mr. Donovan is an obvious choice. But then the president reflexively pledged (and the vice president followed up with the same promise on Sunday) to restore ravaged neighborhoods and homes in Queens and on Staten Island to the way they were before Hurricane Sandy.
That was business as usual, and the last thing the region or the country needs. At this point there's no logic, politics and sentiment aside, to FEMA simply rebuilding single-family homes on barrier islands like the Rockaways, where they shouldn't have been built in the first place, and like bowling pins will tumble again after the next hurricane strikes.
''Retreat is a dirty word,'' as Robert S. Young, a North Carolina geologist, has described American sentiment, but better finally to face reality and make plans for smarter construction, compensation and even, where necessary, relocation. Elected officials and utility companies shouldn't just turn on the lights and heat and restore crippled elevators in forgotten public housing projects that were inadequately designed in the first place.
Common sense dictates upgrading many of these projects to withstand floods but also devising new homes elsewhere for some residents. Cost-benefit analyses, long overdue, should answer tough questions like whether it's actually worth saving some neighborhoods in flood zones. Communities like Breezy Point should be given knowledge, power and choice about their options, then the responsibility to live by that choice.
This means embracing a policy of compassion and honest talk. It's no good merely to try to go back to the way things were, because they are not.
This sort of conversation is a third rail of American politics, so it's no wonder all presidents promise to rebuild and stick taxpayers with the tab. That billions of dollars may end up being spent to protect businesses in Lower Manhattan while old, working-class communities on the waterfronts of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island most likely won't get the same protection flies in the face of ideas about social justice, and about New York City, with its open-armed self-image as a capital of diversity.
But the decisions ahead come down to nature and numbers, to density, economics and geology. Our relationship to the water can't stay the same, and at the same time the city is not worth saving if it sacrifices its principles and humanity.
So the real test post-Sandy will be negotiating between the two.
Faced with cholera and calamitous urban living conditions in the early 1800s, city planners ran roughshod over property rights to install the street grid. Outrage gradually yielded to rising real estate values, Central Park and the modern metropolis.
During the last century Robert Moses, accumulating unbridled authority to get what he wanted done, bulldozed into existence parks and beaches, highways and housing projects by recklessly destroying old neighborhoods, starving mass transit, crushing opposition and ''hounding the people out like cattle,'' as Stanley Isaacs, the former Manhattan borough president, said of the hundreds of thousands of mostly poor New Yorkers that Moses displaced.
The defeat of Westway, a Moses-scale proposal during the 1980s to bury the West Side Highway and cover it with parkland and new development, in a sense became the public's epitaph for Moses. Whether that defeat was bad for the city is a question for another time. But New York became more attuned to community-based initiatives, to preservation, environmentalism and circumspection, all good things in ordinary circumstances.
At the same time it lost something of its nerve.
I walked around Brooklyn Bridge Park last week with the landscape architects Matthew Urbanski and Michael Van Valkenburgh, who designed it. We stood by the salt marsh they installed where an old pier had once been. An acre of formerly obscured shorefront opened to the sky. The park survived Hurricane Sandy with hardly a scratch, proving the virtue of soft edges.
In the design process Mr. Van Valkenburgh had asked the state Environmental Conservation Department, which polices the coastline, for permission to float a north-south footbridge, just 12 feet wide, between the embankment where the old pier ended and the next pier over, where the architects are installing sports fields. The idea: People wouldn't have to walk all the way around the shore to get from one pier to the other.
The department said no. The narrow bridge's shadow might disturb the habitats of fish. It was the argument that torpedoed Westway.
Now the task is to create a whole new ecological infrastructure for the region. The hurdles go beyond just a single state authority fearful to concede even a footbridge. They include an alphabet soup of agencies and public officials: Congress and the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut; the Corps of Engineers; FEMA; the Homeland Security Department; the New York State Public Service Commission (which in principle has the leverage to compel companies like Con Ed and Verizon to safeguard its equipment); Amtrak; the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; the city's planning, transportation, parks and environmental protection departments; and the Port Authority, devised as the organization in charge of such epic undertakings, today a shadow of its former self.
The Australians have a mantra for battling climate change: Protect, Redesign, Rebuild, Elevate, Relocate and Retreat. Guy Nordenson, a New York engineer who has spent years researching the subject, talks about controlling floods and controlled flooding, accepting that the water will ultimately get in. This means thinking like the Australians, long term about evolving nature. Our election cycle tends to thwart infrastructural improvements that can take decades and don't provide short-term ribbon-cutting payoffs for politicians, which is why it's a wry commonplace among engineers and architects that autocratic regimes make the most aggressive builders of massive projects.
For New York sea gates alone won't fix the city's problems any more than will porous streets with catchment basins and waterproof vaults under sidewalks to secure electrical systems. At the same time this is a golden opportunity for the United States to leapfrog countries that have pioneered innovative architecture like garages doubling as floodwater containers and superdikes serving as parks and high-density housing complexes -- a chance for designers, planners and engineers finally to get back, after so many decades, to the decision-making table.
The question is: Can we accomplish this in time and fairly?
The young Moses was a political savant with the vision to operate beyond the boundaries of municipalities, cities and bureaucracies and get big things done. But that same genius enabled him to extend his power beyond reasonable limits and finally to sweep aside the precious, small-scale urban values and human decency that sustain a civic democracy. His biographer Robert Caro wrote in the 1970s that Moses ''bent the democratic processes of the city to his own ends to build public works,'' albeit ''left to themselves, these processes proved unequal to the building required.''
''The problem of constructing large-scale public works in a crowded urban setting,'' Mr. Caro added, ''is one which democracy has not yet solved.''
And it still hasn't.

HEADLINE: American Carriers Are Left Behind In Cargo Program

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It began in the mid-1990s as a way to boost America's vanishing international shipping business. But an obscure program to subsidize the shipment of United States military cargo around the world has become something quite different: a $2 billion operation that, paradoxically, is dominated by a handful of shipping giants, all owned overseas.
Sixty ships get millions from the government for hauling tanks, Humvees, fuel, munitions and other equipment across the seas. The vast majority of the ships -- at least 45 -- fly the American flag but are owned by foreign parent companies like Maersk, a Danish shipping company that commands almost half the fleet, records show.
With government financing up for renewal in Congress for another decade, the program's foreign flavor has set off a debate about its future and, more broadly, about the volatile issue of foreign ownership in American industry. 
''Somewhere along the way, the purpose of this program has gone off track,'' said Philip J. Shapiro, who owns a Long Island shipping company with a lone ship in the program. ''It's effectively shut out American companies.''
Many American-owned carriers, without the capital to build the enormous modern tankers and container ships hauling the cargo, or the revenues to run them, have simply been unable to compete with foreign carriers, who often have lower operating costs.
Nonetheless, Mr. Shapiro has started a campaign to challenge the program and give American carriers a bigger role. His charges have angered some fellow carriers, who accuse him of trying to boost his own business, but they have also caught the ear of his home state lawmaker Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
While their parent companies may be in Europe and Asia, carriers in the program boast a strong American presence, both commercially and politically.
They have large American subsidiaries that run their operations here, employing more than 2,000 American merchant mariners to sail ships and a number of retired United States military officers to run their operations here and sit on their boards.
The carriers have also hired some of Washington's best-known lobbyists, like J. Dennis Hastert, the former House speaker, to plead their case to the government. Executives and industry groups, meanwhile, have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Congressional candidates, many of them longtime supporters of the program.
Even the ship names have an American feel. Maersk, the Danish conglomerate, has named most of its ships in the program after American states, sailing the Maersk Missouri, the Maersk Carolina and many others under the American flag. APL Marine, owned by a Singapore conglomerate, prefers former presidents, like the President Truman and the President Polk.
Retired Gen. John W. Handy of the Air Force, appointed in June as president of Fidelio, a New Jersey-based shipping arm of Wallenius Wilhelmsen of Norway, said he feels dual allegiances to the military and to the American-flagged ships he runs.
''I would not be doing what I do unless I believed passionately in the U.S.-flagged fleet,'' he said in a telephone interview.
While his top bosses are in Norway, he said, ''I don't feel intimidated or at all controlled by them, but they clearly are the owners, no doubt about that.''
Administration and Congressional supporters say the program, which provides both routine transportation of military cargo and a backup war fleet in times of emergency, has proved a financial boon and a national security asset.
The program began in 1996, growing out of the Persian Gulf war five years earlier. The United States had to rely on nearly 300 foreign-flagged ships during the war, leading to the realization that the American-flagged maritime fleet -- which boasted some 2,000 ships in the World War II era -- was essentially disappearing from international waters.
In contrast, more than 90 percent of military cargo in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq since 2009 has traveled on American commercial ships under the program, officials said, and the United States has become less dependent on foreign-flagged ships.
''I can't imagine wanting to kill a program recognized as so valuable to the economic security and the national security of this country,'' said Albert J. Herberger, a retired vice admiral who helped create the program and now works as an industry adviser.
To avoid foreign interference, carriers owned by overseas companies must demonstrate that their American operations are controlled by American citizens.
But Mr. Shapiro, president of Liberty Maritime Corporation on Long Island, maintains that this requirement is routinely abused and that 49 ships are effectively owned or controlled overseas. His company filed a complaint this month with the United States Maritime Administration.
''To allow 82 percent of the program to be controlled by foreign-owned companies?'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''This is not how the program should work.''
Officials at the maritime agency declined to respond to the specific charges raised by Mr. Shapiro regarding abuse of maritime rules, but they said they have never had an incident of foreign interference with any vessel in the program.
''The ships themselves are U.S. flagged, owned, controlled and staffed,'' Meghan Keck, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''Some of them may have parent companies overseas, but the companies employ all U.S. mariners and meet the definition for carriers put in place by Congress.''
Mr. Shapiro has a clear financial interest in the outcome. Beyond the one ship his firm already operates, he says that two new ships it purchased for a total of $175 million deserve to be included as well.
The debate is now in the hands of Congress. A provision passed by the House and pending before the Senate would provide $2 billion through 2025 and eventually raise each ship's annual stipend from $3.1 million to $3.9 million.
In what he calls a ''a David vs. Goliath'' battle, Mr. Shapiro has a Washington lobbyist seeking to block the measure and is threatening legal action.
Yet his best hope may rest with Senator Schumer.
Mr. Schumer's office said he has met with military and maritime officials to ''relay the concerns'' expressed by Mr. Shapiro.
Mr. Schumer, who has received $6,800 in campaign contributions from Mr. Shapiro, has been influential on such issues in the past. In 2006, in a politically charged battle, he succeeded in blocking a Dubai firm from running American ports. Mr. Hastert, then the House speaker, also helped kill the Dubai deal. Now Mr. Hastert is on the other side of the issue, working as a lobbyist for Maersk as it seeks increased federal subsidies. He did not return calls seeking comment.
Foreign ownership of American-flagged ships rankles people like Gene Taylor, a former Mississippi congressman active in maritime issues. ''Our nation has to prevent the vulnerability of relying on foreigners to move our supplies,'' he said. ''We want to be counting on our fellow Americans to move our goods.''
But that may not be possible because of the shrinking number of carriers based in the United States that are big enough to carry cargo across the seas.
''There'd be no way that pure American companies could carry all this cargo,'' said Mr. Herberger, the retired vice admiral. ''That's the reality of today's world.''
The dispute has taken on personal overtones, with some of the program's supporters charging that Mr. Shapiro has put his company ahead of national interests. ''What Phil is doing here is outrageous,'' Mr. Herberger said. ''He's willing to let the whole program die just to get two more ships.''

HEADLINE: Retailers Add Politics and Nature to Their Holiday Worry List

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Many retailers have more than the usual riding on sales beginning this Thanksgiving weekend.
The presidential election pushed holiday shopping later than usual because some toy and game makers held off on their big introductions for maximum attention. The aftereffects of Hurricane Sandy have included logistics problems and merchandise delivery delays. And some retailers, trying to keep inventory lean during uncertain economic times, have given themselves little room for error: shipments of holiday toys, for instance, are down 13 percent this year, to the lowest level since 2007, according to the global trade research firm Panjiva.
All of that makes for a particularly strange holiday season, retailers and analysts say. 
''The election sucks all of the oxygen out of the room in terms of attention,'' said Eric Hirshberg, the chief executive of Activision Publishing, the video game company. ''A lot of the best media inventory goes to the candidates. It gets more expensive because there's this premium demand from the candidates.''
Hasbro is adding more shades of its Furby toy through the end of the year, and Mattel last week introduced a new Monster High video game. Last year, Activision introduced its big Call of Duty release in early November. This year, though, it did not release Call of Duty: Black Ops II until Nov. 13.
''We were also worried that if we released Call of Duty before the election, no one would show up to vote,'' Mr. Hirshberg said. (He was speaking facetiously, but given that the game's retail sales were more than $500 million in the first 24 hours after it made its debut, he may have a point.)
And while retailers were expecting the election to delay some shopping, they were not expecting a storm. RetailNext, which tracks shopper traffic, said that store visits and sales in the Northeast were down about 25 percent during the storm and afterward.
Major retailers have said the election and Hurricane Sandy affected sales. Saks and Target said the beginning of November was choppy, and Macy's said that the storm seemed to have pushed sales later into the season.
''Some of it is lost, most is postponed,'' Karen M. Hoguet, Macy's chief financial officer, said of demand. ''It's a question of timing.'' And Kohl's chief executive, Kevin Mansell, said the company typically experienced sales slowdowns pre-election and postelection, ''and then the business kind of accelerates.''
The late introductions and delayed shopping put toy companies, in particular, in a difficult position: they were under pressure to make hit toys, largely via preorders and layaway, months before people would actually be buying them. Retailers and toy companies started trying to gauge demand early, looking for preliminary data on which items were unpopular and which ones were stars.
Walmart started layaway a month earlier this year versus last year, and Toys ''R'' Us also started holiday layaway earlier, giving the stores a jump on things. Amazon and other e-commerce sites are promoting tools like preorders, wish lists and gift registries -- anything that can give them a sense of what people will buy as the Christmas season churns on.
Preorders are ''an important tool to gauge customer demand, and get some feedback from our customers earlier in the process,'' said John Alteio, director of toys and games for Amazon. Product introductions later in the year ''can be challenging in the toy industry, so we have to draw some comparisons when we can and make the best estimate.''
Paul Solomon, co-chief executive of Moose Toys, which makes Micro Chargers and The Trash Pack, said preorders and layaway were becoming increasingly important. ''It's giving us a good read, early, as to how things are performing, and it's even more crucial now to make a lot of noise about the brand earlier than in previous years,'' he said.
''Preorders are kind of a cottage industry for games like Call of Duty,'' Mr. Hirshberg, the Activision chief, said. The company began promoting the game in March, when it ran spots during the NBA playoffs.
In May, it released an ad featuring Oliver North, the national security aide at the heart of the Iran-contra affair and a consultant on the game, talking about the future of warfare. It accepted preorders starting in May. Through the summer, Activision revealed different facets of the game at various conferences, and this month it began running international television, outdoor, digital and mobile ads.
''There's not a clean math equation that says this many preorders equals this many sales, but it's confidence-building for us in terms of orders, in terms of production,'' Mr. Hirshberg said.
John Barbour, the chief executive of LeapFrog, learned the value of early promotion after last year, when the children's tablet LeapPad1 became a surprise hit. ''It was very hard for me to gauge how successful it would be. Everyone took their best shots,'' he said. By November and December, the LeapPad was selling out, and Mr. Barbour had to pay a premium to source tablet screens, and paid for airplanes to fly in extra inventory.
This year, he focused on early promotions that would translate into preorders and layaway, so toy retailers could accurately adjust their orders in time for the holidays. A good response early on means not just bigger orders from retailers, he said, but also more promotional support and more shelf space: it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
''For retailers, it's phenomenal. It brings demand forward, and they get a better read on what they're going to need,'' he said. When the LeapPad2 became available for preorders in August, it sold as much in two days of preorders as it did in its first week on sale last year, Mr. Barbour said.
He is being careful not to get too jubilant, though. ''The penalties for having too much inventory are greater than the penalties for being a little bit short,'' he said.
Still, some brands were ignoring the strange events of this holiday season and proceeding as usual. Stephen Bebis, the chief executive of Brookstone, said some products were becoming available in the final months of the year, but that was because of production delays, not strategy.
''People are still going to have to buy gifts for Christmas no matter who's the president,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Private Equity And Hostess Stumbling Together

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
"What's happening with Hostess Brands is a microcosm of what's wrong with America, as Bain-style Wall Street vultures make themselves rich by making America poor."
That was Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation's main union federation, on the collapse of the maker of Twinkies last week. He added: "Crony capitalism and consistently poor management drove Hostess into the ground, but its workers are paying the price."
Notice he was quick to invoke Bain-style, as in Bain Capital of Mitt Romney fame, as a populist synonym for corporate rape and pillage. On Twitter, a new adverb - a pejorative, really - emerged in conversations about Hostess: Bained. 
While Bain has nothing to do with Hostess, another private equity firm does: Ripplewood Holdings. That firm took control of Hostess as part of a bankruptcy process in 2009.
But the story of Hostess and private equity - at least over the last couple of years - is hardly the cliché that Bained portrays. No tears need to be shed for Ripplewood and its investors, but they weren't part of a get-rich-quick scheme either.
Ripplewood, which was founded by Timothy C. Collins, a major Democratic donor, is expected to lose most, if not all, of the $130 million or so it invested in Hostess. The company's lenders, led by Silver Point Capital and Monarch Alternative Capital, are not expected to fare well either.
The behind-the-scenes tale of Hostess and Ripplewood may be the opposite of a project to buy it, strip it and flip it. When Mr. Collins originally looked at Hostess, he was trying to make investments in troubled companies with union workers. He was convinced that he could work with labor organizations to turn around iconic American businesses, and he hoped Hostess would become a model for similar deals.
Early on, Mr. Collins sought out Richard A. Gephardt, the former House majority leader, who had become a consultant on labor issues, to help Ripplewood acquire Hostess and work with its unions. Mr. Collins had previously been a donor to Mr. Gephardt's election campaigns, according to an article in Fortune magazine this year that described the relationship.
It was Mr. Collins's relationship with Mr. Gephardt - a Democrat and longtime friend of labor - that helped make the deal happen in the first place.
While Ripplewood sought significant concessions from the unions in 2009, some insiders and outside analysts privately suggested that Ripplewood did not fight hard enough for even greater givebacks from the unions in the bankruptcy process - savings worth $110 million - perhaps as a function of Mr. Collins's relationship with Mr. Gephardt. In addition, the company was saddled with $670 million in debt, which had jumped by about $200 million as part of the sale during bankruptcy.
Ripplewood's luck - and its investment thesis - could not have been worse. With the sputtering economy, the increase in commodity costs, pressure from competitors that were consolidating and out-of-whack labor costs, Hostess's fate seemed assured from nearly the beginning. Still, Ripplewood continued to throw good money after bad trying to keep Hostess from faltering.
And unlike some of the horror stories we hear about private equity firms paying themselves huge dividends and leveraging their companies even further, Ripplewood didn't do that.
Having said all that, Ripplewood's management was far from a model for the industry. For at least the first year of the new ownership, Ripplewood charged Hostess management and consulting fees, according to people briefed on the payments, which were "in the millions of dollars." As Hostess's balance sheet worsened, Ripplewood stopped seeking the payments, these people said.
Worse still, Mr. Gephardt's son was added to the board of Hostess and paid an annual fee of $100,000.
Perhaps the most egregious sin of Ripplewood's oversight of Hostess was the increase in management's compensation at the same time it was seeking to cut employee compensation. The Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers International Union pointed out that the company's new chief executive was paid $2,550,000, up from $750,000. Another "executive received a pay increase from $500,000 to $900,000 and another received one taking his salary from $375,000 to $656,256," the union said. Mr. Collins declined to comment.
A spokesman for Mr. Trumka said Mr. Trumka stood by his reference to Bain and pointed to a statement that he wrote on the liberal Web site Daily Kos: "It's true that the latest investors who led the company were incompetent. It's also true that they threw a lot of cash into the company, hoping to make a good flip. But the overarching issue stands - Wall Street investors destroyed an American icon and the working lives of some 18,500 families."
Frank Hurt, the president of the union that went on strike, said, "Our members are on strike because they have had enough. They are not willing to take draconian wage and benefit cuts on top of the significant concessions they made in 2004 and give up their pension so that the Wall Street vulture capitalists in control of this company can walk away with millions of dollars."
Unless a compromise is reached, Hostess's employees are likely to lose their jobs soon. And either way, Ripplewood isn't going to walk away with millions of dollars. So much for being Bained.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fliers Pay More for a Fill-Up

BYLINE: By HARRIET EDLESON

 BODY:
Rising fuel surcharges have begun to become an issue in negotiations between airlines and corporate travel managers over the cost of airline tickets.
The charges were initially tied to the rising cost of fuel, but industry experts say they have turned into a way for airlines to increase fares.
''Airlines can use fuel surcharges as indirect fare hikes and masquerade them as fuel surcharges,'' said Henry Harteveldt, co-founder of the Atmosphere Research Group and an airline and travel industry analyst in San Francisco. 
''Airlines are quick to raise fuel surcharges when fuel costs increase, but slow to reduce the surcharges when fuel prices go down,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''It is a way for an airline to indirectly raise its fares without signaling to its competitors that it's trying to raise fares. The base fare is almost a form of pricing camouflage.''
Corporate travel managers say that while they have begun to raise the issue with airlines, the surcharges themselves are not being discounted.
''It's one element that needs to get into the mix for negotiation but I have not seen any discounting on that,'' said Michael Steiner, an executive vice president of the Ovation Travel Group, a travel management company in New York. Rather, he said, travel managers can use fuel surcharges to negotiate discounts on the base fare.
Mr. Steiner said companies had also been trying to negotiate lower fees for Wi-Fi, baggage, legroom and other amenities that airlines used to provide as part of the ticket price but for which they now charge extra.
The International Air Transport Association, a trade group for airlines, declined to comment on fuel surcharges. In an e-mail, a spokeswoman, Miriam Ashong, said the surcharges were ''quite a sensitive topic and as such we cannot make any comments at the moment.''
Victoria Day, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, the trade group for airlines in the United States, said in an e-mail, ''For antitrust reasons, we cannot comment on specific fuel surcharges.''
Fuel surcharges, Mr. Steiner said, can increase the base fare by 10 to 50 percent. ''Hotel costs are 20 percent of air cost and rental cars are 5 percent of air,'' he said.
Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a business travel management group, has found that even as fuel prices fluctuated, the surcharges either stayed the same or rose. ''Fuel dropped back down but carriers have not dropped fuel surcharges,'' said Brent Eisenach, director of the CWT Solutions Group, Americas, based in Minneapolis.
The company estimated that fuel surcharges now represent about 7 to 12 percent of total corporate travel spending. ''Fuel surcharges are one of the many variables to look at,'' Joel Wartgow, senior director of the CWT Solutions Group, Americas, said. ''They are one thing to evaluate if you are seeing increased costs year over year.''
Air transportation is often the biggest element in the cost of business travel, with hotels and rental cars representing a far smaller proportion. Hervé Sedky, senior vice president and general manager for global business partnerships and premium services at American Express Global Business Travel, said in an e-mail that ''on average, we have seen companies spending slightly over 50 percent'' of their travel and entertainment budget on transportation.
Because the cost of travel has risen, business travelers are spending more on fewer trips, according to the Global Business Travel Association. The association projects that total business travel spending in the United States will be 2.6 percent higher in 2012, reaching $257 billion by the end of the year. The increase, it said, is driven mostly by rising business travel costs.
At the same time, total business trip volume -- the number of business trips -- is expected to drop to 438.1 million this year, down 1.6 percent from 2011. The group said it expected business travel spending to continue to grow next year while the number of trips drops 1.1 percent.
According to the association, economic turmoil in Europe, slower growth in China and unemployment in the United States are all expected to curb business travel growth in the United States through the end of the year. Businesses are taking a cautious approach until there is greater economic certainty, the group's report said. Companies are not cutting business travel spending, it said, but growth is ''very modest.''
To drive down the cost of business travel, Mr. Steiner of Ovation Travel recommended negotiating a market share discount with one or more airlines. Corporate travel managers and travel management companies have been able to negotiate lower fares by promising a certain market share.
Booking in advance, typically 14 days, Mr. Steiner said, can save 15 to 20 percent on the price of an air ticket. He added that companies should identify nonessential travel, although some travel managers prefer to leave such decisions to the travelers and their supervisors.
Other advice from travel managers includes:
¶ Companies should decide which business travelers can book which class of service, like business class or coach, and make those rules part of the corporate travel policy.
¶ Companies should establish daily maximums that a traveler can spend while traveling.
¶ When possible, companies should use videoconferencing.
Also, Mr. Steiner said that travel managers should remember that the airlines might be willing to deal. ''The airlines say, 'We will give a discount across the board' if you book a certain number of fares in markets that are important to them.''

 BODY:
8 P.M. (Sundance) ICONOCLASTS: KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR + CHUCK D Mr. Abdul-Jabbar, the N.B.A.'s career scoring leader and a Hall of Famer, and the rapper Chuck D (above right, with Mr. Abdul-Jabbar) collaborated last year on the documentary ''On the Shoulders of Giants,'' about the New York Renaissance basketball team. Popularly known as the Harlem Rens, this all-black basketball team was formed in 1923 during the Harlem Renaissance, and regularly beat white teams and won the inaugural World Professional Basketball Tournament in Chicago in 1939. In this season finale the men discuss jazz and basketball while delving into race relations, history and cultural influences. 
7:35 A.M. (Showtime 2) GREY GARDENS (1975) Before the Broadway musical and the HBO film there was this portrait of Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Little Edie, below, directed by David and Albert Maysles. An aunt and a first cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the two lived as recluses in a deteriorating mansion in East Hampton, N.Y. ''There is no doubt about the artistry and devotion that the Maysles have used in recording the life in 'Grey Gardens,' '' Richard Eder wrote in The New York Times. ''There is no reason to doubt them when they say they love and admire the Beales. But the moviegoer will still feel like an exploiter. To watch 'Grey Gardens' is to take part in a kind of carnival of attention with two willing but vulnerable people who had established themselves, for better or worse, in the habit of not being looked at. And what happens when the carnival moves on?''
11:15 A.M. (MoreMax) IN AMERICA (2003) Johnny (Paddy Considine), an Irish actor, and his wife, Sarah (Samantha Morton, who received an Oscar nomination for best actress), try to start over in New York after the death of their young son in this modest but sincere drama from Jim Sheridan. Djimon Hounsou (nominated for best supporting actor) is Mateo, a reclusive painter, dying of what seems to be AIDS, who is befriended by Johnny and Sarah's daughters (Emma and Sarah Bolger). Mr. Sheridan (''My Left Foot'') wrote the film with his own two daughters; the three were nominated for best original screenplay. ''This movie, from moment to moment, feels small, almost anecdotal,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''It is only afterward that, like Mr. Sheridan's other films, it starts to grow into something at once unassuming and in its own way grand.''
4 P.M. (TCM) BONJOUR TRISTESSE (1958) Cécile (Jean Seberg), a 17-year-old idling away her summer on the Riviera with her playboy father (David Niven), schemes to hang on to her decadent lifestyle -- not to mention her father's attention -- when he becomes engaged to a former friend (Deborah Kerr) of her mother's. Otto Preminger directed this drama, from the novel by a teenage Françoise Sagan. In ''Jules and Jim'' (1962), at 6, Jeanne Moreau plays a tempestuous beauty who comes between college friends (Henri Serre and Oskar Werner) in François Truffaut's adaptation of Henri-Pierre Roché's 1953 semi-autobiographical novel.
10 P.M. (13, 49) POOR KIDS With one in five of the nation's children living in poverty, and 1 in 45 homeless, ''Frontline'' travels to the Quad Cities -- the area straddling the Mississippi River that includes Davenport and Bettendorf, in Iowa, and Rock Island, Moline and East Moline, in Illinois -- to examine the lives of youngsters growing up amid unemployment, foreclosure and financial distress.
10 P.M. (USA) COVERT AFFAIRS Season 3 ends as Annie (Piper Perabo) travels to Amsterdam to rescue a spy who was taken hostage.
3:20 A.M. (Cinemax) CAPE FEAR (1991) In this Martin Scorsese remake of the 1962 thriller directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, Robert De Niro portrays Max Cady, a paroled psycho with a fondness for tattoos and human flesh, out for vengeance against the Southern lawyer who defended him, and his family. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange play the target and his wife; Juliette Lewis is their daughter, who's a bit too alluring for her own good. ''Mr. Scorsese is having fun with 'Cape Fear,' at heart a shaggy-dog story, but he brings to it the same manic intensity and innovative techniques evident in his more solemn work,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. ''Stay away if you're squeamish but, if you do, you'll miss an essential work by one of our masters, as well as two of the year's most accomplished performances, those of Mr. De Niro and Ms. Lewis.'' Both received Oscar nominations. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Alternatives to the Traditional Family

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Age of Possibility'' (column, Nov. 16):
David Brooks says the problem with society in this ''age of possibility'' is that people ''go through adulthood perpetually trying to keep their options open.'' 
But certainly it is possible to view this as an improvement over centuries of more ''traditional'' values, like denying the humanity of homosexuals; the subjugation and oppression of women; and institutionalized discrimination against pretty much every non-Anglo-Saxon ethnic group.
The various values and commitments to choose from are no less valid or moral for not being ''traditional'' (whatever that means). The two-parent family and ''commitments to family, God, craft and country'' might be lifestyle choices that work for some people, who are still free to pursue some or all of those ideals.
The difference now is that others won't be forced into a life they either don't want or can't have, and they won't be made to feel ashamed about whatever life they choose to live. This is progress.

To the Editor:
We surpassed seven billion humans last year. The United Nations projects that we'll hit at least nine billion by 2050. Yes, people in most nations are having smaller families. No, we are not running out of people.
Nations with aging populations will have to make adjustments. This does not portend economic doom. Low-birthrate Germany is still the powerhouse of Europe. Meanwhile, nations with persistently high birthrates -- mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Central Asia -- remain impoverished. David Brooks worries about ''tradition,'' but the 222 million women in developing nations lacking contraception wonder how they'll care for another child when they can't feed the seven they already have. To them, tradition means suffering.
Mr. Brooks finds being ''enshrouded in commitments that transcend personal choice'' preferable. I'd venture to say most women -- with millenniums of experience -- do not.
AMY PHILLIPS BURSCH Media Relations Manager Population Connection Washington, Nov. 16, 2012
To the Editor:
When people ''go through adulthood perpetually trying to keep their options open,'' I consider them to be in the pursuit of happiness. I don't see why government should intrude with laws and tax credits aimed at family formation and fertility, as David Brooks suggests.
The notion that we somehow are obliged to procreate and sustain the current family-oriented societal structure is laughable, but one that I, as part of a childless married couple, have encountered before.
Government has a legitimate interest in stable relationships among its citizens and in children developing to their full potential. The fear instilled by religion and patriarchal employers may have kept many tied to the traditional family structure for a long time, but society would be better off accepting the new reality of secularism and creating structures for stable relationships and child rearing outside the traditional heterosexual marriage.

HEADLINE: Finding Rhyme, if Not Reason, in Election Season

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
DOGFIGHTThe 2012 Presidential Campaign in Verse
By Calvin Trillin154 pages. Random House. $16.
Calvin Trillin composes poetry on deadline,Drawing inspiration straight from a headline.He likes to send up politicians in verse,Chronicling follies that get worse and worse.
Earlier volumes mocked George W. Bush as the ''Shrub,''With a dangerous impulse to make lots of flubs.They followed the adventures of McCain and Caribou BarbieAnd the ascent of Obama in the political derby. 
The 2012 campaign is Trillin's focus in ''Dogfight.''Its title invokes the Romney dog Seamus's plight.That poor Irish setter on the roof of the family car,Whose tale so doggedly stuck to the former Olympics czar.
There's lots to laugh about in these pages.The absurdities will echo for ages.But sad for a country with real problems and fearsThat fell by the wayside in this campaign of jeers.A race without poetry and played way down in the gutter,With a slew of candidates who failed to set hearts aflutter.
This book lacks a certain je ne sais quoiSome Trillin rhymes are unnecessarily blah.Maybe the poet's tired of pols and their gameAnd so fallen back on lines that are lame.Still, a weary Trillin is better than none,So this isn't a book the reader should shun.
Like many a satirist, this bard is better at mean.He's looking for opportunities to vent lots of spleen.So birthers and wing nuts get lots of ink,Tea-Party-ers Trillin thinks are making a stink.The Republican primaries are a pageant of clowns.One nutty story after another, making the rounds.
There's Rick Perry, the slick Texas gov who said ''Oops'';And Michele B, once known as Palin ''minus moose.''There's pizza man Cain, who shouts ''Nine Nine Nine'';And Mitt, who doesn't have a whole lot of spine.There's the other Rick, fond of his sweater vest;And ''the Newtster,'' who likes to puff out his chest.
Trillin spills endless ink on the losing chumpsAnd silly sideshow hucksters like Donald Trump.But he eventually moves on to the Big Show,Starring Mittens and Barry, trading blow for blow.
Republicans think the sluggish economy promotesTheir candidate, while unraveling his opponent's hopes.But the wealthy Man from BainMight not get a chance to reign.Awkward, distant and stiff, he often seemed like an android;His line about trees being the ''right height'' made all the tabloids.Such remarks and his flip-flops and car elevatorMade him seem like a robot, not a Terminator.
Trillin doesn't have much to say about Obama,The prez who passed health care and nailed Osama.He mentions the conventions with their theatrics and ire,Including Clint and his chair, and Bill Clinton on fire.Then it's on to Denver and the first debate,When Obama snoozed and endangered his fate.Some Dems, says Trillin, ''began to panic,''Was ''that debate, they asked, Barack's Titanic?''
The Republicans felt they might win November,Especially as Mitt swerved toward the center.Then Hurricane Sandy helped change the dynamic,And made Romney supporters more and more frantic.
The strategists David, Axelrod and Plouffe, had the knowledgeOf how to score a big win in the Electoral College.They helped the president earn another term,His supporters' hopes suddenly reaffirmed.
Poet Trillin has chronicled it all in this book,Which you can read on paper, Kindle or Nook.While he's no Steve Sondheim, and has penned better books,Rhyming on deadline isn't as easy as it looks.

HEADLINE: European Union Backs Syrian Opposition Coalition

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Hania Mourtada contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- The European Union offered crucial support for the new Syrian political opposition on Monday, calling the group legitimate representatives for the Syrian people in a move that burnished the new coalition's credibility as it seeks more international aid to help in the fight against the government of Bashar al-Assad.
The union stopped short of conferring full diplomatic recognition, as France, Turkey and several Arab countries of the Persian Gulf have done, and instead urged the coalition to develop a plan to create a ''credible alternative to the current regime.'' 
The new group, the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, as it is formally known, said on Monday that it would be based in Cairo, the Egyptian state news agency reported. Formed after days of negotiations in Doha, Qatar, the coalition replaces an earlier one that was regarded as ineffectual, in part because it included few figures from within Syria and had little credibility with front-line fighters.
''The E.U. looks forward to this new coalition continuing to work for full inclusiveness, subscribing to the principles of human rights and democracy and engaging with all opposition groups and all sections of Syrian civil society,'' the European Union said in a statement Monday.
As the new group continues to gain international recognition, it hopes to secure agreements from Western and Arab countries to supply heavier weapons to the rebels to hasten the demise of Mr. Assad's government.
Meanwhile, within Syria, the coalition's legitimacy is being tested by some of the fighting groups, whose links to outside political leaders have been tenuous in the past. Several extremist Islamist groups fighting in Syria have said they reject the new Syrian opposition coalition, which was formed under the guidance of the United States, Turkey and gulf countries. The development underscored worries about the rising influence of religious fundamentalism amid the chaos of the bloody civil war in Syria.
The Islamist groups are involved in fighting government forces in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, and include units aligned with Al Qaeda. They made their declaration in a video uploaded to the Internet on Sunday, saying their goal was to establish an ''Islamic state'' in Syria and that they would reject any plans for the country imposed from abroad.
At the conclusion of the video, a man holds up a Koran and yells, ''Make the Koran your constitution and you will prosper!''
The video, in turn, was quickly rejected by commanders of the Free Syrian Army, the umbrella group for loosely knit bands of opposition fighters across Syria, and some residents of Aleppo mocked the video in postings on Facebook. While it called attention to the growing role played by Islamist groups, the video, and the controversy it created among other rebel groups, also highlighted the lack of unity among the myriad groups trying to topple the government of Mr. Assad.
In an interview with Orient TV, a private Syrian channel based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Abed al-Jabar al-Akidi, the commander of a rebel military council in Aleppo that supports the new political coalition, dismissed the video as merely ''an expression of a personal opinion'' and insisted that the coalition had broad support among the fighters.
Fighting continued to rage along Syria's border with Turkey on Monday. Continued fighting was reported in Ras al-Ain, a city of mixed Arab and Kurd population that was bombarded fiercely by government jets last week.
Reuters reported that rebel fighters in the city, who are mainly Arabs, clashed with Kurdish fighters there, raising the ominous prospect of an armed struggle for control of Syria's predominantly Kurdish region in the east, which the government had largely ceded to local control. A local Kurdish official in Ras al-Ain was said to have been shot dead by a rebel sniper.
Most of the fighting in the Syrian conflict so far has been between the mainly Sunni Arab rebels and the Alawite-led government forces. But many analysts worry that the country's Kurds, some of whom have received military training in northern Iraq, might resort to arms to secure more autonomy or even independence for their corner of Syria, further destabilizing the country.
The fighting between the Kurds and rebels also has regional implications; the war has emboldened Kurdish militants in southeastern Turkey, where they have fought the government for nearly 30 years, to step up their attacks.

HEADLINE: Tax Talks Raise Bar for Richest

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
By most measures, the personal finances of Anne Zimmerman, a small-business owner in Cincinnati, have little in common with those of Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison.
Ms. Zimmerman runs an accounting business and a cloud-based Internet service company with combined annual profit of $250,000 to $500,000 in recent years. Mr. Ellison made nearly $15 million in salary, bonuses and perks in 2011, even without the $62 million he received in stock options from Oracle.
In the deficit reduction debate now consuming Washington, however, both Mr. Ellison and Ms. Zimmerman are grouped in the same, sprawling category: wealthy Americans targeted for tax increases.
President Obama has focused efforts on raising revenue from the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers -- individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and families with adjusted gross incomes above $250,000 -- calling them ''millionaires and billionaires who can afford to pay a little more.'' Republicans have thus far resisted those efforts, countering that the high earners are job creators and that increasing their taxes would discourage hiring. 
But for all the broad brush rhetoric of political debate, the rate increases and limits on deductions now being discussed by the president and Congressional Republicans are calibrated to take the biggest bite out of the highest earners. They would lead to a smaller increase for those who earn less than $500,000 a year. The figures are all adjusted gross incomes, and since some deductions would be preserved, a household would probably have more than $250,000 in total income, perhaps $300,000, before it would fall into the wealthy definition used by the president.
If all Mr. Obama's tax proposals for wealthy Americans were enacted, they would raise $1.6 trillion over the next decade. And an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research firm, found that the increases would be heavily weighted toward the wealthiest. Taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $1 million would see average increases of $184,504, the study found, with higher taxes on the ultrawealthy bloating that average. Those with adjusted gross incomes from $200,000 to $500,000 would face a tax increase averaging $4,446, with people toward the lower end having only a modest increase and people on the higher end paying several times more.
A married couple with two children earning $300,000 would see its effective tax rate increase to 21.1 percent from 16.5 percent, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. A married couple with two children earning $2 million would see its effective federal income tax rate rise to 26.8 percent from 21.6 percent.
To Ms. Zimmerman, the Cincinnati businesswoman, that amount sounds reasonable.
''I'm not going to change my business decision-making process based on a few percentage points of tax increases,'' she said. ''If it helps get the country on a better path, well, we're all in this together.''
But some conservatives and business advocates warn that the proposed increases could stall the sluggish economic recovery.
''There is a price that comes with these tax increases on the very wealthiest because that is where the capital is concentrated,'' said William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative research firm. ''That price is economic growth and hiring.''
About four million of the 114 million American households face a possible tax increase. And while they are a narrow slice of the overall population, they are nonetheless a swath of well-to-do Americans so varied that they defy easy categorization. Census data indicates that they cut across a broad range of occupations: doctors, auto dealers and dilettantes, professional athletes and financial planners, family farmers, entrepreneurs, two-income couples, corporate executives and hedge fund managers.
Although they are dispersed across the country, they live in the highest concentrations in South Florida, the suburbs of the Northeast and the West, and in major cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Because the profits of many companies are taxed as the owners' individual income, the group facing increases also includes 3 percent of all small businesses, like Ms. Zimmerman's. But the United States tax code is such a blunt instrument that small business may encompass anything from the neighborhood florist shop to the multibillion-dollar private equity company KKR and the Tribune Company. Data from the Internal Revenue Service indicate that 237 of the country's 400 highest earners also qualify as small businesses, as does President Obama.
Decades ago, the tax code made distinctions between gradations of wealth by using more income brackets. In 1970, there were 14 tax brackets for the top 2 percent of earners, with a top rate of 91 percent. Today there are just two brackets, 33 percent and 35 percent. Meeting with Republican Congressional leaders on Friday, President Obama said he would not sign any bill to extend those top rates, which were lowered by President George W. Bush. That means the top rates would revert to the higher levels of the Clinton era, 36 percent and 39.6 percent (the higher rate would be charged on the portion of income that exceeds the threshold of $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families). Republicans have said they will oppose any deal that raises the rates.
But both sides have agreed in principle on raising revenue by reducing or eliminating loopholes, tax subsidies and deductions at the high end of the income scale. Even if the top rates do not rise, the efforts to limit deductions would make the tax system more progressive, with the biggest impact felt by those at the very top in incomes.
Negotiations over the coming weeks will determine whether a compromise can be reached between the president and the Republicans. If not, automatic spending cuts and tax increases will take effect on Jan. 1.
One of the most closely watched variables will be whether President Obama wins support for increasing the tax rate on dividends and long-term capital gains, which now top out at 15 percent. Mr. Obama's budget calls for the tax on capital gains to rise to a maximum of 20 percent and for dividends to be taxed at the same level as ordinary income, which could increase to 39.6 percent. Because investment income for those with adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 will also be subject to a 3.8 percent Medicare tax beginning in January, as part of the new health care law, the total federal tax on dividends could rise to 43.4 percent and on capital gains to 23.8 percent.
Those capital gains and dividend tax increases are likely to have the most impact at the very highest reaches of the income scale because wealthy Americans derive more of their earnings from investments.
An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that in 2011, people in the top 0.1 percent of earners saved an average of $356,000 in federal income taxes because of the preferential rate for capital gains. Middle-income Americans were spared an average of just $23 because of the lower taxes on capital gains, the study found.
''Capital gains are extremely concentrated by income,'' said Len Burman, a former Treasury official who has written extensively about taxes on investment income. ''There's no source of income more focused on the very, very wealthiest. A lot of people own stocks indirectly through their 401(k)'s. But most Americans can't afford to own any shares directly.''
Another policy change that has some support from both parties is a plan to limit the total amount of deductions. Mr. Obama's proposal would treat deductions for the wealthy as if they were in the 28 percent tax bracket, reducing their value. But the negotiations have also considered a plan championed by Mitt Romney during his unsuccessful bid to unseat Mr. Obama.
That would cap the amount of deductions any taxpayer could claim -- amounts including $17,000 and $28,000 have been discussed publicly.
In some ways, limits on deductions would appear to duplicate the goal of the alternative minimum tax, which was enacted in the 1970s to ensure that the wealthiest Americans would not completely escape paying federal income taxes. But tax planning has become so sophisticated in the decades since then that even some Republicans acknowledge that a new cap could help raise revenue.
If all of Mr. Obama's proposals are enacted, those with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 to $500,000 would see their after-tax income drop an average of 1.3 percent. Taxpayers with incomes over $1 million would face a decline in after-tax income of 8.8 percent, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center.
Some say restoring high-end tax rates to levels similar to those in the Clinton administration will help trim the deficit with minimal effect on the economy.
''The Bush tax cuts were unaffordable and skewed overwhelmingly to the wealthiest,'' said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. ''So it only makes sense that these tax increases would be concentrated on the highest end, too.''

HEADLINE: Spare Me Your Glossy College Postcards

BYLINE: CANDICE CHILDRESS


HIGHLIGHT: Candice Childress, a high school senior in Las Vegas, has "very little pity for a school with a $100 million endowment that wants to burrow its way into the forefront of my consciousness by bragging about its Frisbee golf team." 

 BODY:
November is halfway over; teacher recommendation letters, last-minute transcript amendments and sanitized personal statements about "what a college education means to me" are all coming down the pipeline for most prospective students in this country.
I've spent the past month and a half whittling down my list of schools and comparing it with my friends and with the vast community of panicked, doubtful students who congregate on the Internet looking for reassurance and emotional validation. The question I've been fielding to these people for the past few weeks has been, in one form or another: Why, exactly, are you applying there?
Most answers are predictable. Vibrant cities, nearby relatives, vague conjectures of grad school opportunities. But the people I worry about most - and I have been among their ranks in the past - are those hung up on illusions about the student body that they aspire to join: what these people are like, what they've accomplished, what they hope to achieve.

The school is known for its engineering program - but what good have the students done with those degrees? Are they formulating cheaper, safer, longer-lasting bridges to benefit underdeveloped areas, or are they padding their pockets and racking up their Christmas bonuses with ethically unsound but economically viable projects? 
All jobs are noble in their own way, but so many students with the potential to forever shape our own little American microcosm of human drama and dreams are lured away by solid names and insubstantial legacies. I want my friends to be secure, but I want society to be secure as well.
I want bold intellectual growth, but I don't want it filtered down to me through recruitment pamphlet-friendly community living arrangements and a rubber-stamped recommendation from top-brass faculty. I want political discourse without pandering and without inborn prejudices. As a woman and as an American, I want a school that was borne out of hardship, progress and a commitment to egalitarian education, not a haven for Daisy Buchanan types scoping out a coed set to inherit the family firm. College should be about making an impact on the world, not tossing up quasi-Mencken bon mots at faculty members' dinner parties.
As someone who hopes to serve the next generations of Americans through the conservation of a history unreachable for me and impossibly distant for them, I can't permit glossy postcards to sway me. Arbitrary numbers have no bearing on the education that I receive - what relevance does the median G.P.A. of the class of 2015 have to my life? Should I be impressed by the fact that a faceless, nameless crowd of thousands managed to scrape through trigonometry and live to tell the tale? Or should I be drawn to schools where students - students who come with part-time jobs and hard-won maturity, not oboe lessons and AP Economics, tucked away in their transcripts - have a documented record of thriving and working to protect and advance their communities?
I don't believe in reducing people to light and shadow, to club positions and SAT subject tests. I want to know what they believe in their bones and what they are going to do about it.
Some of the schools to which I am most attracted are not known for their academics. They can't be found in U.S. News rankings or among the aspirations of my high school's last graduating class. But they are schools where Native American languages are spoken, where immigrant groups are advocated for, where grass roots political action takes precedence over disingenuous campuswide displays of solidarity inherited from the ghosts of administrations past.
There are students who combat voter suppression and economic inequality, and there are students who crack open a Coke at their campus rallies and let nature take its course, squirreling away service hours all the while. For me, the best motivation is to be around people who are alive, gloriously, gloriously alive, and who are fighting for causes bigger than themselves, in one way or another.
So how can colleges continue to push their holiday pageants, interacademic feuds and horrendous open-mic nights as recruitment tools, and how can students, year after year, be duped by that message of conformity and complacency?
Most of my friends unhappy with college life feel most betrayed not by funding cuts or an unfair distribution of resources, but by those pat persuasions they welcomed in their in-boxes not so long ago. Dorm life loses its sheen; the sunsets are never as golden as the postcards would like to pretend.
When you pick a school for meaningless diversions cloaked as bonding opportunities, disappointment is inevitable. That might sound harsh, but I feel very little pity for a school with a $100 million endowment that wants to burrow its way into the forefront of my consciousness by bragging about its Frisbee golf team.
The business of living day to day on a college campus is one thing; meal choices, student housing and local safety should of course be taken into consideration when making a decision. But when a prospective applicant has very little to go off of besides cursory second-hand remarks like "My cousin was an astronomy major there in the '90s, and she thought it was pretty O.K.," "I think a Kennedy went there once" and - my personal favorite - "This person on the Internet with totally different experiences, capabilities and fundamental life skills is urging me to head east," then he or she should be wary of supposed benefits like new facilities (often set aside for a department not even remotely related to his or her own), study abroad programs (most of which require commitments that working students cannot possibly afford, time-wise or moneywise) and on-campus activities (I like cheap concert tickets as much as the next guy, but I'm not going to sacrifice four years of my life for them).
Everyone wants to belong, but not everyone does, or has, or will - and that's okay. I can't help but laugh when I receive a letter telling me how compatible I'll be with the rest of my class, how I'll welcome my freshman year roommate with open arms when she comes to visit me in 15 years. This school knows nothing about me apart from my PSAT scores and some vague biographical factors salvaged from a pile of printouts in some dank storage room who knows where.
Who are they to say that I'll be happy there, that I will agree with - or find room to disagree with - their student body? The audacity present in that stance is astounding, as is the naïveté of college applicants who are determined to "make it" somewhere they can catch only glimpses of until they're parked in their desks on the first day of Psych 101.
For all the passion that the class of 2013 espouses in their application essays, they certainly aren't making an effort to find schools that are up to snuff, that will foster that dedication and turn it into devotion.
I may only be 17, but when I die, I want people to say, "She did her best to love her people and protect their past," and not, "She engaged in a set of pointless campus-bound extracurriculars in a desperate attempt at camaraderie."
I'm willing to be a two-word footnote in the annals of human history, but not in the record book of the campuswide beer pong championships of 2012. I refuse to resign my life to that, and I'm shocked and confused by the fact that so many of my talented, ambitious, driven peers are more than willing to do so.

HEADLINE: Set the Stage, Then the Table

BYLINE: JOHN LELAND and DARCY EVELEIGH


HIGHLIGHT: There was a time when the wizards of the Times photo studio created whole tableaux to situate the dishes they photographed, unlike the food photographers of today. "We tried to show a whole menu." 

 BODY:
These are golden times for seductive food imagery. Open a newspaper or magazine, and prepare to be titillated by otherworldly close-ups of dew-moistened figs glistening on pillowy beds of sheep's milk ricotta. 
But the next time you find yourself transported to epicurean ecstasies by that brazenly smutty food shot, ask yourself: Where's the romance? Where are the accouterments of seduction: the appetizing locales, the carefully set tables, the lethal firearms mounted on the wall above the fresh-killed roast of venison?
Where is the story?
In the 1950s and '60s, when Julia Child was introducing Americans to the art of French cooking, New York Times photographers like Eugene Maggio, Bill Aller and Alfred Wagener, working in the ninth floor kitchen with a home economist who tested all the recipes, brought more than just food into their layouts, propping each roast or noodle dish like an Off Broadway production. They weren't food voyeurs; they were food choreographers or scenarists, concocting domestic narratives from the prop shops that used to dot Midtown Manhattan. They thought big and shot wide.
"The guys before us were even more stylized than we were," said Mr. Aller, 85. "Today they mostly seem to show single dishes. We tried to show a whole menu."
One day The Times's in-house studio might become a Tuscan farmhouse, the better to introduce readers to a pasta dish. The next, it was a Maine fisherman's cottage, draped with netting and organized around a well-placed black-and-white lobster. In these shots the food was alluring not just in itself but in the action conjured around it - the imagined friends or family members who might gather at those tables, raise those glasses, pay compliments to the home cook (and Times reader) whose skill made it all come together. The food in these photographs is a catalyst, not a spectacle; a good meal is a conduit to great conversation, not a conversation-stopper.
"They were actually things you could do yourself," Mr. Aller said. "It was not that fancy - roast this, boil that." Some days Mr. Aller would be called upon to shoot two or three entrees. Another day would be all desserts. And they would eat the results after.
"I had a lot of fun, gained a lot of weight," he said.
Of course, we've moved beyond that now. Food now is to be admired on its own, placed on a pedestal above the social concerns and manners invoked here. A luscious food spread might show the full-sleeve tattoo of the chef, but it won't show the Buddha smiling over the table or the ironed napkins whose presence lends the meal grace or whimsy. The fantasy or aspiration inherent in the shots - the promise of perfection, mastery or neighborly competitiveness - has moved on, from the place settings to the artisanal masterpieces placed perfectly on them.
Which look like nothing, alas, that will appear on most of our tables.

HEADLINE: Kissinger in Cambodia

BYLINE: LUKE HUNT


HIGHLIGHT: A local NGO hosts a game of darts to highlight the limitations of Washington's opportunistic policy toward Cambodia. 

 BODY:
PHNOM PENH - Theary Seng was taking aim with precision and anger. The 41-year-old U.S.-trained lawyer and a regular on Cambodia's crowded protest circuit was about to throw a dart at a poster of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Kissinger is one of 13 politicians and senior Khmer Rouge leaders in adart game created by Poetic Justice, a nongovernmental organization run by Theary Seng that highlights deficiencies of the special U.N.-backed tribunal judging the Khmer Rouge's crimes. Each player gets five throws. A bull's-eye is worth seven points. The highest score wins. 
Last Sunday afternoon, Theary Seng and three members of her staff were playing on Phnom Penh's riverfront opposite the storied Foreign Correspondents' Club. On this occasion - the fourth time the game has been staged in public - the point was to draw attention to the narrow scope of the Khmer Rouge tribunal ahead of President Barack Obama's visit for a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Earlier this year, Duch, the warden of the Khmer Rouge's most secretive detention center, was sentenced to life for the torture and execution of almost 13,000 people. But only three of Pol Pot's closest colleagues are currently on trial for the deaths of up to two million people between 1975 and 1979. Another two casesare mired at the investigation stage, some say because of interference by the Cambodian government.
Theary Seng, who survived the Khmer Rouge as a young child but lost both her parents, says the tribunal's mandate should be expanded. She was a civil party to the proceedings but pulled out because of what she says are the tribunal's shortcomings.
One of those shortcomings is the failure to hold responsible those who ordered the carpet bombings of Cambodia in the early 1970s, even though, Theary Seng argues, the destruction they wrought helped bring the Khmer Rouge to power. In those years Washington entertained an uneasy, opportunistic alliance with Lon Nol, the general who seized power after ousting Prince Norodom Sihanouk in a 1970 coup and was in turn ousted by the Khmer Rouge in 1975.
The U.S. bombing campaign, Theary Seng said while setting up the targets for the dart game, "had the direct consequence of killing half a million people and the indirect consequence of creating the conditions that gave us the Khmer Rouge. Kissinger is legally and morally responsible." But with the scope of the special Khmer Rouge court limited to crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979, no earlier action by the United States will be considered.
Today, the opposition leader Sam Rainsy and other critics argue that the United States' current relations with the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen also have the hallmarks of political expedience: Washington's "pivot" policy in Southeast Asia is pushing the White House closer to unsavory regimes with dubious human rights records.
This point wasn't lost on the crowds gathered around Theary Seng or on the 300-odd tourists who filled the restaurants nearby. And it certainly wasn't lost on the 20 police officers and 10 senior district officials in plain clothes who moved in as she began explaining the rules of the game through a microphone.
The security officers leapt for the foam-backed posters of Nixon, Pol Pot and Mao Zedong. Spoiling for a confrontation, they destroyed the targets while yelling at the crowd: "You are obstructing public order!" "We are security!" "We can do anything!"
Punches were traded. Theary Seng was pushed and shoved. "Obviously, they're a bit sensitive with Obama coming to town. But what can you say: They're control freaks," she said. "It's an authoritarian regime that wants a picture-perfect image for the summit, and this does not accord with reality."
The ASEAN summit meeting that Hun Sen is hosting this week is the largest gathering of regional and world leaders ever assembled in Cambodia, and Obama's visit is the first by a sitting U.S. president. Obama's highly anticipated arrival has prompted a litany of complaints and a slew of protests. 
Eight people living under the flight path near Phnom Penh's international airport were briefly detained Friday for painting "S O S" alongside pictures of Obama on the rooftops of their houses. They had been ordered to vacate their homes to create a security zone ahead of the president's arrival. Protests by underpaid garment workers and villagers evicted from their land occur almost daily.
When Hun Sen and his minders step back to look at how Cambodia handled its year as chair of ASEAN, one hopes they will also take a hard look at themselves. If Hun Sen is as serious as he seems to be about quelling dissent ahead of elections next year, his government would do better to examine why so many Cambodians are demonstrating rather than rough up a 40-something woman for playing a game of darts.

HEADLINE: What the Banks and the S.B.A. Could Learn From Silicon Valley

BYLINE: AMI KASSAR


HIGHLIGHT: If the merchant cash advance companies can get money to businesses in a few days, couldn't the banks do the same? 

 BODY:
Last weekend, my family and I packed our car full of supplies and drove to a fire station in New Jersey to deliver goods to an area that had been hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Like tens of millions of other Americans, we tried to make our small contribution. The experience was eye-opening for my children. They saw the devastation firsthand. And they got to see the volunteers organizing supplies and the Red Cross van delivering food to whomever needed it.
Somehow, when there is a natural disaster, Americans rally together to help one another. We don't rely on politicians in Washington to create policy and hope for change. We're willing to open our wallets and our hearts. We all know, it just as easily could have been us. This is true for corporations and individuals alike. 
And yet, it occurred to me that one can draw some interesting comparisons between hurricanes like Sandy or Katrina and the financial crisis that hit our country four years ago. The financial crisis may not have ripped down houses, but it did rip a lot of people out of them. Small-business owners may not have had to tape their windows, but many had to shut their doors. But the response to this crisis has been very different.
For many small-business owners, the financial crisis started with their banks. Burt Helms of Inc. magazine has written a thoughtful piece that explains how banks responded to the crisis and the impact that response has had on millions of small-business owners. The article explains how banks abandoned even successful businesses. "By June 2012," Mr. Helms reports, "small-business loans were down $56 billion from their June 2008 peak of $336.4 billion."
So what has America done to help? The primary outgrowth of the small-business banking crisis has been the explosive growth of the alternative-lending market for small businesses. Last week, Paul Davidson described many of the new programs -- like merchant cash advances -- that have become the norm for so many owners across the country. The article reported, chillingly, that "small businesses are paying up to 60 percent interest for loans, and they're gritting their teeth but they're happy to get them."
Private industry has rallied around the banking crisis to create new business models and new opportunities. Some of the best technologists and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley are behind these alternative lenders. And prominent banks provide the capital that these companies turn around and lend to small businesses.
What's wrong with this picture? Can you imagine the outrage if well-established corporations were capitalizing on the devastation created by Hurricane Sandy? What would the scenes look like on television if Americans were driving to New Jersey to sell their supplies at a handsome profit instead of giving them away?
Let's set aside the emotional and human toll a small-business owner endures when confronted with choosing between paying 60 percent interest rates or shutting down the business. Let's focus on the economics.
In the wake of the great recession, with the economy still sluggish at best, many of us are living in an incredibly low-interest-rate environment. Banks can borrow money for pretty much nothing. But small businesses cannot. Clearly, something has gone wrong in the delivery of capital. There has to be a more efficient way to get reasonably priced money into the hands of small-business owners.
On one extreme, banks fight to lend to small-business owners with strong collateral, cash flow and credit at rates as low as 4 percent. On the other extreme, millions of small-business owners are being forced to turn to the alternative lending markets. Wedged in the middle are a smaller percentage of small-business owners who manage to weave through the Small Business Administration process to get a loan.
How can we make access to capital for small-business owners more rational? How can we ensure that more small businesses get to take advantage of the low interest rates?
Here is one suggestion: I think we need to ask what the S.B.A. can learn from the private lenders. These companies - many of them backed by hedge funds and venture capitalists -- have come up with an excellent formula to underwrite loans based on bank statements and automatic daily withdrawals from bank accounts. The process is far less arduous than applying for an S.B.A. loan, and it works. It works so well that small businesses can get a cash advance in as few as two days. The only problem is the expense. So here's my question: Is there a way for the S.B.A. and the banks to learn from the alternative lenders and use the same process -- preferably with a smaller margin?
What do you think? Can you share other ideas that you think would make access to capital for small-business owners more productive?
 Ami Kassar founded MultiFunding, which is based near Philadelphia and helps small businesses find the right sources of financing for their companies.

HEADLINE: Expansion by Big Ten May Bring Small Payoff

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The Big Ten is adding Maryland and Rutgers to its ranks. The main rationale seems to be economic, and on that account the conference's decision may be questionable. 

 BODY:
Maryland accepted an invitation to join the Big Ten Conference on Monday. Rutgers did the same on Tuesday, expanding the conference's roster to 14 teams and its footprint to the East Coast.
The new additions would bolster the Big Ten's reputation for strong academics. Both universities are members of the Association of American Universities, as are all current Big Ten institutions, with the exception of Nebraska.
Their athletic heritages are mixed, however. The Rutgers football team has finished the season ranked in the Associated Press top 25 once in the last 35 years, although it is currently ranked No. 21.
Maryland's football team has finished the season as a ranked team eight times in the same period. Its basketball team has had more consistent success, winning a national championship in 2002. 
But the main rationale for adding the schools seems to be economic: the prospect that they would give the Big Ten, and its cable network, access to the New York and Washington media markets.
On that account, the decision may be questionable. Although Rutgers and Maryland are in densely populated areas, they also compete against a number of other Division I football programs for fans and attention.
 Moreover, affinity for college football is considerably lower in the Northeast than it is in the Midwest or the South. Thus, the teams have fewer fans than most other current Big Ten members.
Last year, I conducted an analysis of the 120 members of the N.C.A.A.'s Football Bowl Subdivision, attempting to estimate the number of fans devoted to each program.
The analysis was conducted in two steps. First, I estimated the number of college football fans in each of the United States' 210 media markets, multiplying their populations by a factor based on the number of people who conducted Google searches for the term "college football" in each area. (Some markets, like Birmingham, Ala., have much higher college football avidity than others, like Bangor, Me.)
Next, the college football fans in each market were further divided between F.B.S. schools, based on the results of an Internet-based survey called the Common Census Sports Map. Thus, every college football fan in America was, in theory at least, mapped to his or her favorite team.
Although New York is the nation's largest media market, and although Rutgers is the most popular team in the New York City area, its over all numbers were just average by this method.
That's because only about 15 percent of New Yorkers are avid college football fans, among the lower figures in the country. 
In addition, although Rutgers might be the most popular college team in the region, it hardly dominates the market, with many fans declaring allegiance to universities like Syracuse, Connecticut, Penn State or Notre Dame instead. Many New Yorkers are also transplants from other parts of the country, and bring their football allegiances with them. Only about 20 percent of college football fans in the New York region listed Rutgers as their favorite team.
Therefore, although there are approximately 20 million residents in New York's media market, only about 3 percent of these people are estimated to be fans of Rutgers football specifically. That's about 600,000 people.
There are also about 300,000 Rutgers football fans in other markets along the East Coast or elsewhere in the country, bringing the total to about 900,000.
But that's below the Big Ten average of 1.4 million to 1.5 million fans per team. Programs like Wisconsin, which is close to the average with 1.4 million fans, might not seem to have as much media muscle. But these universities often have the affinity of whole states unto themselves, states where college football is a religion on Saturdays rather than an afterthought.
Maryland does somewhat worse still by this method. Although it is the predominant college football program in Maryland, the state has little passion for college football. And the program has little following outside Maryland's immediate borders, where higher-profile teams like Virginia, Virginia Tech, West Virginia and Penn State tend to dominate.
My method estimated that the University of Maryland has just shy of 500,000 college football fans, which ranks 58th in the country and which would be lower than any university now in the Big Ten.
Maryland and Rutgers are not necessarily poor choices compared with some of the other logical alternatives.
I count five other universities that are A.A.U. members, that play in a major college football conference, and that are either within a current Big Ten state or border one.
Missouri, with about 1.1 million fans, is the most attractive of this group. But it recently joined the Southeastern Conference, after getting on-again, off-again attention from the Big Ten.
Pittsburgh and Kansas rank somewhere between Rutgers and Maryland in terms of their fan counts. 
The last two universities that qualify for the list, Iowa State and Colorado, have about as many fans as Maryland does.
The question, rather, is what the Big Ten stands to gain at all by expanding. Fans of a current Big Ten team might find their new schedules less compelling.
Wisconsin Badgers fans, for example, will now have fewer opportunities to see their team play against regional rivals like Iowa, Michigan and Illinois. Those matchups will instead be replaced by more games against Rutgers and Maryland.
Many college football fans also travel to road games, which bolsters business for local restaurants and hotels. It is about a three-hour drive from Madison, Wis., to Iowa City. But it is 15 hours to College Park, Md., and more than 16 hours to New Brunswick, N.J. 
The sacrifice might be worth making for games against Notre Dame, Texas or perhaps even Missouri. But universities in the Northeast seem to reduce both the geographical integrity of the conference and the quality of the average Big Ten football game.
It is probably no coincidence that the two most popular college football conferences - the SEC and the Big Ten - have until now been the most conservative about expansion. The most recent additions to the Big Ten, Penn State and Nebraska, ranked as the 3rd and 18th most popular football programs in the country. The newest additions to the SEC, Texas A&M and Missouri, were ranked 6th and 23rd. 
Rutgers and Maryland are outstanding public universities, but they are just not in the same league in terms of football.
The Big Ten may have expanded its revenue pie, but it will be dividing it 14 ways rather than 12, and among family members that have less history of sitting down at the table with one another. In seeking to expand its footprint eastward, the conference may have taken a step in the wrong direction.

HEADLINE: Steelers Run Help Wanted Ad; Burress Answers

BYLINE: LYNN ZINSER


HIGHLIGHT: Pittsburgh has signed Plaxico Burress, late of the Jets and Giants -- and Charlie Batch will start at quarterback on Sunday. 

 BODY:
You know things are getting pretty grim in Pittsburgh when fans are suddenly reminded that Charlie Batch still plays for the Steelers -- and will most likely start at quarterback on Sunday -- and that Plaxico Burress is suddenly necessary on the other end of the passes. 
The Steelers signed Burress off the N.F.L. unemployment line on Tuesday after he spent the first six weeks looking for a team running out of receivers. The Steelers, Burress's former team, fit the bill. Receiver Antonio Brown is going to miss his third straight game with a high ankle sprain and Jerricho Cotchery sustained multiple rib injuries late in Sunday's loss to Baltimore. Burress, 35, had no takers at the start of this season after playing for the Jets -- and catching 45 passes for 612 yards and eight touchdowns -- last season. That followed a hiatus created by a two-year jail term for gun charges related to shooting himself in the leg in a Manhattan nightclub in 2008 while he played for the Giants.
The player throwing him the ball this week isn't whom Steelers fans expected to see either. Batch has been the Steelers' backup quarterback off and on since 2002, with most of the "offs" because of injury. When Batch was lost for the 2008 season with a broken collarbone, the Steelers signed Byron Leftwich to back up Ben Roethlisberger and ever since, Batch has lived the tenuous existence of a third-string quarterback. 
But Roethlisberger is out with a shoulder injury and Leftwich sustained rib injuries while the Ravens treated him like a tackling dummy in last Sunday's game, so Batch will step in to play in only his 30th game since 2002. The Steelers also signed former Patriots clipboard-holder Brian Hoyer to back up Batch.
The good news for the Steelers? They are 6-4 and get to play 2-8 Cleveland this weekend. Batch and Burress undoubtedly appreciate that scheduling coincidence.

HEADLINE: Younger Students More Likely to Get A.D.H.D. Drugs

BYLINE: ANAHAD O'CONNOR


HIGHLIGHT: Students who are the youngest in their grades scored worse on standardized tests than their older classmates and were more likely to be prescribed stimulants for attention deficit disorder, a new study reports. 

 BODY:
A new study of elementary and middle school students has found that those who are the youngest in their grades score worse on standardized tests than their older classmates and are more likely to be prescribed stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
The findings suggest that in a given grade, students born at the end of the calendar year may be at a distinct disadvantage. Those perceived as having academic or behavioral problems may in fact be lagging simply as a result of being forced to compete with classmates almost a full year older than them. For a child as young as 5, a span of one year can account for 20 percent of the child's age, potentially making him or her appear significantly less mature than older classmates. 
The new study found that the lower the grade, the greater the disparity. For children in the fourth grade, the researchers found that those in the youngest third of their class had an 80 to 90 percent increased risk of scoring in the lowest decile on standardized tests. They were also 50 percent more likely than the oldest third of their classmates to be prescribed stimulants for A.D.H.D. The differences diminished somewhat over time, the researchers found, but continued at least through the seventh grade.
The new study, published in the journal Pediatrics, used data from Iceland, where health and academic measures are tracked nationally and stimulant prescription rates are high and on par with rates in the United States. Previous studies carried out there and in other countries have shown similar patterns, even among college students. 
Helga Zoega, the lead author of the study, said she had expected there would be performance differences between students in the youngest grades, but she did not know that the differences, including the disparity in stimulant prescribing rates, would continue over time. 
"We were surprised to see that," said Dr. Zoega, a postdoctoral fellow at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and an assistant professor at the University of Iceland. "It may be that the youngest kids in class are just acting according to their age. But their behavior is thought of as symptoms of something else, rather than maturity."
In the study, Dr. Zoega and her colleagues tracked over 10,000 students born in Iceland in the mid-1990s, following them from fourth through seventh grade, or roughly ages 9 to 12. Iceland has detailed national registries containing health and academic information, so the researchers were able to compare students' scores on standardized tests and look at the medications prescribed to them. 
The researchers then divided the subjects based on the months in which they were born. In Iceland, children start school in September of the calendar year in which they turn 6, and the nationwide birthday cutoff in schools is Jan. 1. So the oldest third in any grade are born between January and April. The middle third are born between May and August, and the youngest third are born between September and December. 
The study showed that average test scores in mathematics and language arts, which covers grammar, literature and writing, were lowest among the youngest students in each class. On standardized tests at age 9, the children that made up the youngest third ranked, on average, about 11 percentile points lower in math and roughly 10 percentile points lower in language arts than their classmates who made up the oldest third. Compared to the oldest students, the younger ones were 90 percent more likely to earn low test scores in math and 80 percent more likely to receive low test scores in language arts. By the seventh grade, the risk had diminished somewhat, but the younger children were still 60 percent more likely to receive low test scores in both subjects. 
A similar pattern was seen with A.D.H.D. medication, with students in the youngest third of their grade significantly more likely to receive stimulant prescriptions than their classmates in the oldest third. Dr. Zoega found that gender had some influence as well. Over all, girls scored higher than boys on tests, and had lower rates of stimulant prescriptions. But ultimately there was still an age effect among girls for both academic performance and the use of A.D.H.D. medication.
The findings dovetail with research carried out by two economists, Kelly Bedard and Elizabeth Dhuey. In looking at fourth graders around the world, the two found that the oldest children scored up to 12 percentile points higher than the youngest children. Their work, which was described in the best-selling 2008 book "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell, has shown a similar pattern among college students.
"At four-year colleges in the United States," Mr. Gladwell wrote, "students belonging to the relatively youngest group in their class are underrepresented by about 11.6 percent. That initial difference in maturity doesn't go away with time. It persists. And for thousands of students, that initial disadvantage is the difference between going to college -- and having a real shot at the middle class -- and not."
Dr. Zoega said she did not want her study to be seen as an indictment against stimulants. Instead, parents and educators should consider a child's age relative to his or her classmates when looking at poor grades and at any behavioral problems.
"Don't jump to conclusions when deciding whether a child has A.D.H.D.," she said. "It could be the maturity level. Keep in mind that he or she might not be performing as well as the older kids in the class, and that should not be a surprise."

HEADLINE: The South's Man in London

BYLINE: ANDRE M. FLECHE


HIGHLIGHT: How a Swiss immigrant became the South's leading propagandist in Britain. 

 BODY:
In late 1861, a 27-year-old naturalized Alabamian from Switzerland named Henry Hotze was sent on a secret mission to London. Officially, he would be a Confederate commercial agent, negotiating trade deals between Britain and the South. But his real task, given to him by the Confederate secretary of state, Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter, was much more sensitive: to persuade the British people to support the Confederate cause.
Hotze's mission represented a departure in Confederate foreign policy. When the war began in April 1861, Confederate officials had hoped that the economic power of cotton alone would force the British government to intervene on the Confederacy's behalf. For much of the 19th century, Britain had carried on a booming trade with the American South; Southern plantations supplied cotton fiber to the bustling textile mills of Birmingham and Manchester, and, in return, Southern planters furnished their homes with British goods and filled their libraries with British books. Few Confederate patriots could have imagined that Britain could long tolerate any disruption to this lucrative commerce. 
To speed British action, early in the war the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, ordered growers and shippers to withhold cotton from the world market. He imagined that his embargo would wreak financial havoc, causing factories to close and throwing thousands of laborers out of work - and that, to save the world financial system from collapse, the British government would have no choice but to help arrange a cease-fire, or, better yet, join the war against the Union. Davis's stratagem became known as "King Cotton Diplomacy."
It was a miserable failure. London was less reliant on Southern cotton than Davis had assumed. A Union naval blockade began to gradually choke off Southern ports, making the very premise of King Cotton diplomacy moot. The Royal Navy had not taken to the seas to ensure the flow of cotton, nor had officials in London committed troops to the cause of Southern independence. The British government had not yet even agreed to officially recognize the Confederacy as an independent nation. It was Henry Hotze's job to figure out what had gone wrong. 
Hotze arrived in London in early 1862. What he found worried him. The lack of Southern cotton had not troubled the English people nearly as much as the Confederate leadership had assumed it would. A mild winter had allowed British workingmen and -women to make ends meet, even while working fewer hours. Some speculators, cotton wholesalers and merchants had actually profited by the cotton shortage as prices rose and importers shifted to growers in India and Egypt to meet demand. In general, Hotze found most Englishmen "cold and indifferent" toward what he called the Confederacy's "great war for a nation's life." 
Though the picture looked bleak at the moment, Hotze didn't give up all hope. British public opinion might seem apathetic, but he also found it "in a fusible state." He concluded that Southern officials had put too much faith in economic self-interest and had not spent enough time appealing to the hearts and minds of the British people. Determined to seize the opportunity, he proposed to carry out a propaganda campaign on behalf of the Confederacy.
To many white Southerners, Henry Hotze appeared to be the perfect person to represent their cause abroad. In the years before the war, the young European-born American had earned a growing reputation as an academic celebrity in the South. After immigrating to the United States, he took up a career in journalism and quickly embraced Southern causes. During the 1850s, he explained that, as a native of the Swiss republic, he cherished the principles of local self-government. "States rights and federal powers," he declared, had been frequently "discussed over his cradle." 
White Southerners found his views on slavery especially acceptable. As a student in Switzerland, Hotze had developed a keen interest in history, anthropology and the study of race, and he came to the United States convinced that racial characteristics played a key role in determining a person's character, capabilities and intellect. He first became widely known in the South when he translated into English the work of the French count Arthur de Gobineau, who had argued that mankind was divided into three different and inherently unequal races, the white, the black and the yellow. Hotze left his reading of Gobineau a believer in the superiority of the white race and a defender of slavery.
In England, Hotze came determined to employ his views in defense of the Confederacy. He believed that if Englishmen only understood the principles undergirding the struggle of the South, then they would enthusiastically embrace the Southern cause. In early 1862, he published several editorials in British newspapers arguing for recognition of the Confederacy, but in the weeks after they appeared he began to work on a much more ambitious undertaking. In May, he began publishing his own weekly newspaper, which he named the Index.
Under Hotze's direction, the Index became the leading expositor of the Confederate cause in Europe, and one of the most important anywhere. Though the front page always printed information on cotton markets to call attention to English economic interests, the real substance of the paper came in its editorial columns. Hotze recruited writers from Europe and America who shared his intellectual commitments. He chose one of his English writers for his "devotion to the cause of national independence," and he worked hard to recruit famous Southern intellectuals, including the University of Virginia professor Albert Taylor Bledsoe and John Rueben Thompson, former editor of the Southern Literary Messenger. 
Together, Hotze and his writers outlined the intellectual substance of the Confederate cause. First and foremost, they seized on the right of national self-determination. They proclaimed that 19th-century people lived in an "age of liberal thought," in which no serious thinker could deny the right of any people to establish their own government if they wished. The American Revolution of the 1770s and the French Revolution of 1789 had made that quite clear to the world, and the Confederate revolution should benefit from the precedents they had set. The South, one editorial maintained, fought for rights "which have never been disputed to any people in modern times."
The editorials in Hotze's paper worked hard to depict Confederates as heroic patriots fighting for home rule, and they pleaded with Englishmen to recognize the fact. Southerners, one article reasoned, desired only "that self-government which Englishmen practice themselves and usually commend in others." Hotze and his contributors wholeheartedly believed that Southerners had already established a nation, and it only awaited British action to secure its well-deserved independence. "We have just witnessed in the New World," one article declared, "the sublime spectacle of the birth and fiery baptism of a nation."
While these articles appealed to the liberal sentiments of the British people, ultimately Hotze and his collaborators refused to apologize that this new nation was founded on a defense of slavery. In fact, they argued that slavery would give the Confederate nation peculiar unity and strength. Slavery, the argument went, would endow the South with the "intrinsic power to create wealth," while at the same time managing the social inequality between whites that wealth engendered. The British social system had not fared so well. In Britain, a wealthy ruling class had shut out white workingmen from political power, which led to class resentment and hatred. Southerners, however, had extended political rights to all white men by basing social divisions on what Hotze believed to be the natural fault lines of race. Hotze called the position "liberal conservatism," and he believed it would redeem the world.
Despite Hotze's high-profile efforts, "liberal conservatism" did not work any better than had "King Cotton Diplomacy" in persuading the British to join the war. Though Hotze published his paper into April 1865 and beyond, Britain never officially recognized the Confederacy as an independent nation. 
Hotze's efforts did, however, effectively elucidate the principles of Confederate nationalism by linking the achievement of self-determination with the practices of racial subordination and slavery - principles that, in various forms, continued to shape nation-building efforts well into the 20th century, as segregation, imperialism and the tragic history of the First and Second World Wars amply demonstrated.

HEADLINE: Jobless Benefits as an Antipoverty Program

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Last year unemployment insurance kept 2.3 million people above the official poverty line, including 620,000 who were children living with a family member who received benefits. 

 BODY:
In addition to the tax increases and broad federal spending cuts (known as "sequestration") scheduled to take effect at the end of this year, the emergency unemployment benefits system is also expected to come to an end. 
It doesn't get as much attention as the defense cuts or the tax increases, but the end of these extended unemployment benefits is expected to affect millions of Americans. More than two million workers now collecting federal unemployment benefits will lose the lifeline after the week ending Dec. 29. By the end of the first quarter of 2013, another one million will run out of state benefits without ever benefiting from Emergency Unemployment Compensation, according to the National Employment Law Project, a liberal advocacy group.
There seems to be a widely held view -- at least judging from the e-mail I get on the day of each month's unemployment report -- that idle workers don't have jobs because they've gotten used to being paid not to work and would prefer to continue collecting unemployment rather than go out and earn an honest living. But given that so many unemployed workers will have exhausted their benefits or were never eligible for benefits in the first place, more than two out of every three unemployed workers will enter 2013 without receiving any form of unemployment insurance (for example, those whose benefits lapsed or who didn't qualify, because of self-employment or insufficient hours).
These extended unemployment benefits serve as a powerful stimulus measure, economists say, because the money dispensed in the form of jobless benefits gets spent very quickly and so moves through the economy quickly (compared with, say, tax cuts for wealthier Americans, who are likely to save at least some of the money they pocket).
But the other key reason for extending unemployment benefits is, of course, compassion.
Last year 46.2 million Americans lived in poverty, according to the Census Bureau. A recent report from the Congressional Research Service finds that unemployment insurance kept another 2.3 million people above the official poverty line, including 620,000 who were children living with a family member who received benefits.
And bear in mind that the average worker collecting benefits through the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program receives just $291 per week.
By way of background, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program was signed into law in June 2008 by George W. Bush, when the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent.
Today the unemployment rate, at 7.9 percent, is sliding, but is still much higher than it was when these extended benefits were first deemed necessary by Congress and President Bush.

HEADLINE: Indecision and Infighting: That's the Asean Way

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: After 10 years of talks and another missed deadline, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has still not drafted a binding code of conduct for the South China Sea. At its summit meeting this week, the 10-nation group also took no action to set up a crisis hot line. Even North and South Korea have one of those. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Southeast Asian leaders have failed - again - to make any headway on resolving the dangerous territorial disputes over various islands in the South China Sea. 
At their regional summit meeting this week, they could not even agree to set up a crisis hotline. Even bitter enemies like North and South Korea have a cross-border hot line - three, in fact.
The meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, adjourned amid infighting and acrimony on Tuesday with Cambodia, the host nation, appearing to derail efforts at establishing a maritime code of conduct. 
A binding code of conduct has been on the Asean agenda for more than a decade, and the group has blown its 2012 deadline. Riven by factionalism, the group seems to have no clear way forward, despite increasing tensions over several implacable territorial disputes.
The Spratly island group, the Paracel islands and a tiny atoll near the Philippines known as the Scarborough Shoal are claimed by various Asean countries, claims that overlap those of China, which said in June that the islands are "indisputably" Chinese territory. 
Although not one of Asean's 10 members, China counts Cambodia as a key ally and holds tremendous leverage in the region through its economic might, diplomatic clout and an increasingly muscular military.
China has long opposed what is known as an "internationalized" approach to drafting a code of conduct for the South China Sea - that is, any approach that would include the United States. And while Asean dithers on drafting its own overarching code, Beijing prefers to hold bilateral negotiations on its island disputes with each individual claimant.
Asean has never been very efficient at making policy, nor has it been very good at policing its own members, in part because of the so-called "Asean Way," which prohibits members from interfering in each other's domestic affairs. Myanmar, for example, after joining Asean in 1997, existed as a thuggish military regime with barely a word of reproach from its fellow members. 
The group also requires a unanimous vote on any major decisions. A single dissenter among the group can block an otherwise-unanimous decision - effectively creating a hung jury. Landlocked Laos, therefore, will have just as much say over a maritime code as Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia or the Philippines. 
Cambodia and its authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, are now solidly within Beijing's political orbit, perhaps cajoled by more than half a billion dollars in Chinese loans, grants and gifts over the past three months. At recent Asean gatherings, Cambodia has appeared to act as a kind of Chinese proxy.
Chinese investment in Cambodia last year approached $2 billion, according to a report by Reuters - twice the combined total invested by fellow Asean countries and 10 times more than the United States. 
Security analysts and regional leaders say that nasty maritime standoffs over the contested islands - due in part to a more assertive and far-reaching China - have made a code of conduct more necessary than ever. 
A brushing incident at sea, for example, even an inadvertent collision, has the potential to rapidly escalate: One nation's "bumping" is another's "ramming." As one Asean diplomat put it, such situations can get "a little tricky."
Even so, the various claimants still have no collective way of communicating when such incidents occur. There's no hotline, for example, to defuse tensions over a conflict at sea, such as the Vietnam-China skirmish over the Spratlys in 1988 in which 70 Vietnamese sailors were killed. And earlier this year a China-Philippines standoff at Scarborough Shoal dramatically raised regional tensions.
At the Asean meeting in Phnom Penh this week, Indonesia proposed the installation of a regional hot line as a practical, real-world safeguard while a formal Asean code of conduct is hashed out. 
Marty Natelegawa, the Indonesian foreign minister, said that "in the future, should there be any incident of the type that we had, the ministers should be able to quickly pick up the phone and establish communication." 
Without a hot line, he said, "the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation is bigger."
Mr. Natelegawa said he got the general sense from other Asean members that the hot line could be "something important." 
But no action was taken. 
That's the Asean Way.

HEADLINE: The New Republican Tax Policy

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Some Republicans have acknowledged that slashing spending alone is not enough, and that tax revenue must be increased, and now their burden is to persuade their colleagues, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Although it is commonly believed that the Laffer curve - the idea that tax cuts pay for themselves - is the core Republican idea about tax policy, this is wrong. The true core idea is something called starve-the-beast - the idea that tax cuts will force cuts in spending precisely because they reduce revenue. But there are slight indications that some conservatives have awakened to the reality that not only does starve-the-beast not work, but it also leads to higher spending.
The notion came into being in the 1970s to allow conservative Republican economists to reconcile their support for a balanced budget with their party's intense desire to cut taxes without worrying about the deficit. Proposition 13 in California had proven unmistakably that voters didn't much care whether spending was cut; they just wanted lower taxes. 
I have traced the origins of Republican starve-the-beast theory to testimony by Alan Greenspan before the Senate Finance Committee on July 14, 1978 - just weeks after the passage of Proposition 13 on June 6. In explaining why he supported the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which proposed an across-the-board tax rate reduction of 30 percent, while also supporting deficit reduction, Mr. Greenspan said:
Let us remember that the basic purpose of any tax cut program in today's environment is to reduce the momentum of expenditure growth by restraining the amount of revenues available and trust that there is a political limit to deficit spending.

Among those who totally bought into this theory was Ronald Reagan. When criticized for proposing a tax cut in 1981 even though the deficit was high and rising, he replied in a national television address on Feb. 5, 1981:
Over the past decades we've talked of curtailing government spending so that we can then lower the tax burden. Sometimes we've even taken a run at doing that. But there were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know, we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and breath. Or we can cure their extravagance by simply reducing their allowance.
In 2001, George W. Bush justified his tax cut on starve-the-beast grounds, saying it would constitute a "fiscal straitjacket for Congress." According to the journalist Ron Suskind's book, "The Price of Loyalty," the Bush adviser Karl Rove often invoked the starve-the-beast approach as "conservative economic theology" in White House meetings. By 2003, using deficits strategically to slash the size of government was widely considered to be party doctrine among Republicans.
During the Obama administration, the principal enforcer of that doctrine among Republicans is the anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist. He continually argues against tax increases because they feed the beast and lead to higher spending. As he put it in an Op-Ed page column last year in The New York Times, "Raising taxes is what politicians do instead of reforming and reducing the cost of government."
The problem for Republicans, as is so often the case, is that the real-world impact of their theories doesn't measure up to their theories. There was no reduction in spending as a share of the gross domestic product despite a sharp fall in revenues as a share of G.D.P. during the Reagan years. By the time Reagan left office the spending/G.D.P. ratio was about the same as it was in Jimmy Carter's last year: 21.7 percent in 1980 vs. 21.3 percent in 1988.
During the George W. Bush administration, spending increased sharply even as revenues collapsed. Revenues as a share of G.D.P. fell to 17.5 percent in 2008 from 20.6 percent in 2000, yet spending rose to 20.1 percent in 2006, before the economic crisis hit, and 20.7 percent in 2008, from 18.2 percent of G.D.P. 
In short, we have tested starve-the-beast theory in the laboratory, and it has failed miserably. At least a few conservatives have had the courage to acknowledge that lowering the tax cost of spending may be a culprit. After all, the main reason to oppose higher spending is that it will lead to higher taxes. But if people can have tax cuts and higher spending at the same time, why should they not have their cake and eat it too?
In 2007, Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review made this perceptive observation about starve-the-beast theory:
The theory made sense so long as the maximum politically acceptable deficit was an independent variable. But if in fact the effort to cut taxes increased the political system's tolerance for deficits, then spending could go up. And it's easy to see how cutting taxes could make deficits more acceptable. As for practice: The last decade has not been kind to the idea that cutting taxes would restrain spending.
The late economist William Niskanen of the Cato Institute was another pioneer on the right in recognizing the perversity of starve-the-beast theory. His work has been revived by The Weekly Standard's Andrew Ferguson in a new article for the conservative magazine. This is significant because The Standard often sets the agenda for Republicans. This article may signal a change in thinking about whether tax increases may be a better way of starving the beast than tax cuts.
At the risk of reading the tea leaves too closely, I think Mr. Ferguson's article needs to be read in conjunction with comments made by The Standard's editor William Kristol on "Fox News Sunday" on Nov. 11. Said Mr. Kristol: "You know what? It won't kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires. It really won't, I don't think."
Mr. Kristol is not a fool and can read the polls as easily as I can; he knows Republicans are holding a losing hand on taxes. A Nov. 14 Gallup poll shows the percentage of Americans favoring a spending-cuts-only approach to the deficit has fallen in half, to 10 percent from 20 percent last year; the percentage willing to accept higher taxes to reduce the deficit has risen to 86 percent from 73 percent.
Taxes are going to rise; that is no longer in doubt. The question for Republicans is what can they get in return. Starve-the-beast is dead.

HEADLINE: Insider Inquiry Inching Closer to a Billionaire

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Prosecutors charged a former employee of SAC Capital Advisors with insider trading in a case that directly involves the hedge fund's powerful founder, Steven A. Cohen. 

 BODY:
Over the last half-decade, as federal authorities secured dozens of insider trading convictions against hedge fund traders, they have tried doggedly to build a case against one of Wall Street's most influential players: the billionaire stock picker Steven A. Cohen.
On Tuesday, the government appeared to inch closer to that goal. Prosecutors brought charges against a former portfolio manager at the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors in a case that for the first time directly involves Mr. Cohen, the fund's founder.
Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at CR Intrinsic, a unit of SAC, was charged with making more than $276 million in a combination of illegal profits and avoided losses by obtaining secret information from a doctor about clinical trials for an Alzheimer's drug being developed by the companies Elan and Wyeth.
 The case is "the most lucrative insider trading scheme ever charged," said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, who brought the charges in Federal District Court in Manhattan. 
It also draws in Mr. Cohen, whose fund has been in the cross hairs of government investigators since the crackdown on insider trading began. Though not charged or mentioned by name, Mr. Cohen is referred to repeatedly in the government's court filings as either "Portfolio Manager A" or the "owner" of the funds involved. People briefed on the case confirmed that the reference was to Mr. Cohen.
Mr. Martoma worked closely with Mr. Cohen in buying and selling large blocks of Elan and Wyeth shares, according to a lawsuit also filed on Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The government does not say that Mr. Cohen - who has not been charged in the case - knew that Mr. Martoma had confidential information about the companies' Alzheimer drug when he bought and sold the stocks.
"Mr. Cohen and SAC are confident that they have acted appropriately and will continue to cooperate with the government's inquiry," said Jonathan Gasthalter, a SAC spokesman.
From the middle of an expansive trading floor in SAC's Stamford, Conn., headquarters, Mr. Cohen, 56, oversees a fund that manages about $13 billion and, including borrowing from banks, possesses about $39 billion in total buying power. The fund, which has about 900 employees, has generated some of the best investment returns on Wall Street, averaging about 30 percent over the last two decades.
Though the case against Mr. Martoma is the first time the government has pointed to Mr. Cohen's participation in a trade that may have been improper, it is the latest in a spate of insider trading prosecutions of former SAC employees. At least seven former SAC employees have been tied to the government's multiyear investigation; three of them have pleaded to insider trading while working for Mr. Cohen.
Previous cases involving SAC have highlighted the firm's unusual structure: traders are allocated money and invest on their own with little direct input from Mr. Cohen. But in this case, Mr. Cohen is said to have had numerous contacts with Mr. Martoma and appeared to collaborate closely with him.
"The law of averages would tell you that all of these instances at one firm are not coincidences," said Mark Zauderer, a securities lawyer in New York. "People take their cues from the top, and these cases must reflect a culture there."
F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Martoma, 38, early Tuesday morning at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was released on bail after making an appearance in Federal District Court in West Palm Beach. Mr. Martoma, who has been unemployed since leaving SAC in 2010, is expected to appear in federal court in Manhattan on Monday and enter a plea.
"Mathew Martoma was an exceptional portfolio manager who succeeded through hard work and the dogged pursuit of information in the public domain," said his lawyer, Charles A. Stillman. "What happened today is only the beginning of a process that we are confident will lead to Mr. Martoma's full exoneration."
Also accused in the scheme by the Securities Exchange Commission on Tuesday was Sidney Gilman, a neurology professor at the University of Michigan. The S.E.C. said Dr. Gilman, 80, an Alzheimer's expert who helped oversee the clinical trials for the drug, gave Mr. Martoma the confidential information.
Dr. Gilman is cooperating with the government and has entered into a nonprosecution with the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, meaning that criminal charges will not be brought against him. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Dr. Gilman, said that he expected the S.E.C.'s case to be resolved shortly.
Mr. Martoma met Dr. Gilman through the Gerson Lehrman Group, a so-called expert network firm based in New York. Once an obscure pocket of Wall Street, expert network firms became popular among the hedge fund set in the last decade as a way to gain an investment edge. The services linked traders to specialists and consultants in various industries.
But these firms came under scrutiny after the government brought more than a dozen insider trading cases involving these expert networks. In some cases, hedge fund managers paid outside consultants handsome fees for providing confidential information about publicly traded companies. In others, the government charged executives at the expert network firms with knowingly facilitating the exchange of illegal stock tips.
A spokesman for Gerson Lehrman declined to comment. The government's complaint details how Dr. Gilman hid his communications about the trial from the expert network firm.
Dr. Gilman's consulting work for Mr. Martoma earned him about $108,000, according to court filings. Based in part on Dr. Gilman's leaks about positive developments related to the clinical trials of a new Alzheimer's drug, SAC accumulated a roughly $700 million position in the stocks of Wyeth and Elan, according to the government.
The S.E.C. said that the fund's owner, Mr. Cohen, took a large position in Wyeth and Elan in his personal portfolio based on Mr. Martoma's recommendation. Mr. Cohen maintained his holdings even though there was significant internal debate about the wisdom of such a large position in the drug makers, the government said.
But in July 2008, as the trials neared completion, Dr. Gilman told Mr. Martoma that patients were experiencing serious side effects, prosecutors say. Afterward, Mr. Martoma e-mailed Mr. Cohen, telling him "it's important" that they speak. They spoke on the phone for nearly 20 minutes, the government says, and Mr. Martoma told his boss that he was no longer "comfortable" with the investments.
The following day, SAC reversed course. Mr. Cohen's head trader sold the firm's entire inventory of roughly 10.5 million shares of Elan and about seven million shares of Wyeth, the government said. Once it had dumped the shares, SAC built a short position in the two stocks, betting their value would drop.
According to the S.E.C., the trader, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Martoma kept the sales confidential. The trade, wrote the head trader in an e-mail to Mr. Cohen, "was executed quietly and efficiently over a four-day period through algos and darkpools" - referring to trades using algorithms and to trading platforms that do not have the same reporting requirements as the stock exchanges - "and booked into two firm accounts that have very limited viewing access."
After the companies announced the results of the trials, Elan's stock fell about 42 percent and Wyeth's about 12 percent.
The trading allowed SAC to avoid about $194 million in losses and earn about $83 million in profits on Elan and Wyeth, according to prosecutors.
At the end of 2008, Mr. Martoma received a bonus of about $9.3 million, the S.E.C. said. Mr. Martoma's stock picks were less successful in 2009 and 2010, and he received no bonuses then.
According to the government, in 2010 an SAC executive suggested in an e-mail that the firm let Mr. Martoma go, describing him as a "one-trick pony."

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths RICH, ROBERT N

 BODY:
RICH--Robert N. Age 84, of Stamford, CT, passed away after a brief illness at his home in Shippan Point on November 17, 2012. A life-long resident of Stamford, Mr. Rich was graduated in 1944 from Stamford High School and in 1948 from Princeton University. His entire career, spanning nearly 65 years, was spent at F.D. Rich Company, a construction and real estate development firm founded by his father in 1921. The company became one of the largest construction firms in the nation; its projects spanned the continent from Alaska to the Caribbean with both private and public clients. The firm constructed major office buildings, shopping centers, research and office parks, industrial plants, airport terminals and hangars, flood control projects, pavilions at New York's 1964 World's Fair, schools and hospitals. The firm also constructed military and not-for-profit housing. In 1960 Mr. Rich's company was selected as the sole redeveloper of the downtown Stamford urban renewal project. 
The project was led by Mr. Rich in partnership with his late brother, Frank D. Rich, Jr., and the firm's chief counsel, the late Lawrence Gochberg. Construction commenced in 1968 on three architecturally-distinctive apartment buildings known as St. John's Towers. This was followed by the signature 21-story One Landmark Square, which for 35 years was the tallest building in the City and a symbol of its rebirth. Construction of the world headquarters of GTE Corporation, the Stamford Town Center mall, the Marriott Hotel and many other office and apartment projects soon followed. Between 1970 and 2000, Mr. Rich's leadership transformed Stamford from a fading industrial town suffering from severe urban blight to a thriving city which has emerged as an important center for commerce, culture, education and recreation. Mr. Rich employed world-class architects and designers such as Victor Bisharat, Moshe Safdie, Cesar Pelli, Mitchell/Giurgola, Hugh Stubbins and Arthur Erickson in order to create bold designs for the new Stamford skyline, well before the term "starchitects" was coined. Mr. Rich and his brother are credited with bringing a branch of the University of Connecticut to downtown Stamford, which features the Rich Concourse as its central public space. The family's involvement with the University began when his father's company constructed the Wilbur Cross Library at the Storrs campus in 1934. The relationship continued to grow when Frank D. Rich, Jr. served for over twenty years on the University's Board of Trustees. The Rich brothers were also credited with creating the Stamford Center for the Arts, which includes the Rich Forum and the Palace Theatre. Mr. Rich was a long-standing member of the Regional Plan Association and Stamford's State Street Debating Society, which in 2009 named him its Man of the Year. Mr. Rich was a member of the Stamford Yacht Club since 1951, which recently honored him with an award for his many contributions during his lengthy service on the Board of Directors when he was head of its Long-Range Planning Committee. Mr. Rich was a supporter, both personally and through the Rich Foundation, of many community organizations including the Boys and Girls Club (whose building is named in honor of his late mother) and the Stamford Hospital, which includes the Jeanne S. Rich Professional Office Building. Mr. Rich was a voracious reader, an inveterate traveler and a theater aficionado. He enjoyed spending as much time as possible at his second home in Tenterden, England. Asked recently what his proudest accomplishment was, Mr. Rich replied without hesitation and with his customary modesty, "That's simple. I am most proud of my wonderful family." He loved to plan reunions not only for the benefit of his family and many friends, but also for his school mates. A few years ago, one of these gatherings took place in Stamford in honor of his fellow classmates from Burdick Middle School. Born in Stamford on February 13, 1928, he was preceded in death by his wife, Jeanne Slavin Rich; his daughter, Amy Louise Rich; his parents, F.D. Rich, Sr. and Mary Prisco Rich; his brother, Frank D. Rich, Jr., and his sister-in-law, Jean Hopkins Rich. He is survived by his loving partner of more than thirty years, Valerie A. Wiltshire of Stamford; his daughters Priscilla A. Rich of Boone, NC, and Martha Rich Andrus (David) of Boulder, CO; and his sons Christopher M. Rich (Elizabeth) of Roanoke County, VA, and Thomas L. Rich (Suzanne Van Nostrand) of Stamford. Ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild also survive him. A memorial service in honor of Mr. Rich will be held at 11am on Friday, November 30, 2012, at the Stamford Yacht Club. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to the Boys and Girls Club of Stamford (online at: bgcastamford.org or by mail to the Mary C. Rich Clubhouse, 347 Stillwater Ave, Stamford, CT 06902).

HEADLINE: Hamas Left Israel No Choice But to Strike

BYLINE: By MICHAEL OREN. 
Michael Oren is Israel's ambassador to the United States.

 BODY:
Washington
CRITICS of Israel's campaign to defend millions of its citizens from deadly Hamas rocket fire claim that it lacks a clear objective. Israel has bombed Gaza in the past, they argue, and received only rockets in return. Is there any logic, much less an end, to the cycle of violence? Can it lead to negotiations and peace?
Such questions can be answered only by going back to the origin of the campaign that we Israelis now call Operation Pillar of Defense. It did not begin last week, after Hamas fired more than 700 rockets at southern Israel this year; nor did it start four years ago, as Israel acted to stop thousands of terrorist rockets striking its south. It did not even begin in 2005, when Israel uprooted 21 of its Gaza settlements, together with their 9,000 Israeli residents, to advance peace, and received only Hamas terrorism in return. Rather, the operation began on May 14, 1948, the day Arab forces moved to destroy the newly declared state of Israel. 
There were no settlements back then, and the West Bank and East Jerusalem were in Jordanian hands. Yet the very notion of a sovereign Jewish state in the Middle East was abhorrent to the Arabs, many of whom were inflamed by religious extremism. They rebuffed repeated Israeli offers of peace, and instead launched a war of national annihilation. Israel had no choice but to defend itself, losing 1 percent of its population -- the equivalent of 3.1 million Americans today -- before achieving an armistice.
But few Israelis mistook that truce for peace. On the contrary, most assumed that the Arabs would eventually forget their defeat and seek a ''second round.'' Indeed, eight years later, in 1956, Israeli and Arab forces again clashed, and then fought again in 1967, 1973 and 1982. The periods in between were punctuated by Arab attacks and Israeli retaliations. Subsequently, in Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, Israel mounted major counterstrikes against terrorists dedicated to its destruction.
Throughout, Israelis never abandoned the vision of peace. Still, we came to understand that the cause of the conflict was not borders or even refugees but the same hatred of Jewish statehood that drove the Arabs to invade us in 1948. We understood that our enemies required periodic reminders of the prohibitive price they would pay for murdering our families. We also understood that defending ourselves incurred economic, diplomatic and human costs, yet there was no practical or moral alternative. The tactic is deterrence. Our strategy is survival.
Negotiations leading to peace can be realistic with an adversary who shares that goal. But Hamas, whose covenant calls for the slaughter of Jews worldwide, is striving not to join peace talks, but to prevent them. It rejects Israel's existence, refuses to eschew terror, and disavows all previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements -- the terms established by the United States and the other members of the so-called quartet of Middle East peacemakers for participation in the peace process. Bound by its genocidal theology and crude anti-Semitism, Hamas cannot be induced to make peace. But it can be deterred from war.
This was the case with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Like Hamas, Hezbollah is an Islamist organization committed to Israel's demise. It, too, ambushed Israeli soldiers on our side of the border and rained rockets on Israeli towns. Then, in 2006, Israel struck back, destroying much of Hezbollah's military infrastructure, neutralizing its long-range missiles, and killing hundreds of terrorists. Hezbollah internalized the message, and since then its missiles have remained inert. The people of northern Israel, meanwhile, have enjoyed six of their quietest years ever.
This does not mean that the tactics of deterrence and the strategy of survival cannot result in peace. Egypt and Jordan tried more than once to defeat Israel militarily, only to recognize the permanence of the Jewish state and to sign peace accords with it. Similarly, the Palestine Liberation Organization, guided by nationalism rather than militant theology, realized it could gain more by talking with Israel than by battling us. The result was the 1993 Oslo Accords, the foundation for what we still hope will be a two-state solution. By establishing deterrence, Israel led these rational actors toward peace.
Unfortunately, Hamas is not rational. It targets Israeli civilians while hiding behind its own. During a campaign of murder and kidnapping in 2006 and 2007, it gunned down members of its rival, Al Fatah, in the streets. Its covenant says Christians and Jews ''must desist from struggling against Islam over sovereignty in this region''; under its rule, militants firebombed a Christian bookshop. It celebrated 9/11 and mourned the death of Osama bin Laden. We hope some day to persuade its leaders to make peace with us, but until then we must convince them of the exorbitant price of aggression.
Back in 1948, we envisaged a future of security, prosperity and mutual respect with our neighbors. We still cling to that dream. But we must also remain vigilant and, occasionally, neutralize the rockets and combat the terrorists that target us. President Obama said Sunday in Bangkok that ''we're fully supportive of Israel's right to defend itself from missiles landing on people's homes and workplaces and potentially killing civilians, and we will continue to support Israel's right to defend itself.'' Earlier in the trip, his deputy national security adviser, Benjamin Rhodes, said that Israelis would ''make their own decisions about the tactics they use.'' Those tactics, together with our survival strategy, have helped us to create one of the world's most vibrant and innovative societies, while enabling us to pursue peace.

HEADLINE: Asian Nations Plan Trade Bloc That, Unlike U.S.'s, Invites China

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Ten Southeast Asian nations said Tuesday that they would begin negotiating a sweeping trade pact that would include China and five of the region's other major trading partners, but not the United States.
The proposal for the new trade bloc, to be known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, is enthusiastically embraced by China. The founding members, who belong to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said at the close of the association's summit meeting here that the bloc would cover nearly half of the world's population, starting in 2015. 
The new grouping is seen as a rival to a trade initiative of the Obama administration, the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes many of the same countries but excludes China.
The announcement came as China was facing pressure to back down from its hard-line stance in its disputes with four Southeast Asian countries over ownership of islands in the South China Sea.
Five nations at the summit meeting, including Singapore and Indonesia, demanded changes related to the issue in two communiqués that were drafted by Cambodia, the host of the meeting and an ally of China with no claim to the islands, according to a statement issued by Singapore.
The initial draft of one of the communiqués, intended for the association to issue, said that its members, by consensus, did not want the South China Sea issue to be ''internationalized'' -- meaning that the United States and other countries with interests in the security of the sea, one of the world's busiest trade routes, would have no say in the rules of the body of water.
China said Monday that such a consensus existed. But the Philippines, an ally of the United States, publicly protested China's position, and was joined Tuesday by Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam. The final text of the communiqué omitted the reference to a consensus, the statement by Singapore said.
The second communiqué, for the concurrent East Asia Summit, left out any mention of the South China Sea in the initial draft, even though the five members wanted the issue to be included. That communiqué, too, was amended.
In a direct criticism of China's position on the South China Sea, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore said at the East Asia Summit that he hoped the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China would soon start formal talks on a code of conduct that would reduce the risk of conflict over the sea. China has balked at such urgency.
''Talks on a code of conduct will help manage the disputes and prevent conflict which will be bad for everyone,'' he said.
The announcement of the proposed trade pact ended the talks on an upbeat note, despite the underlying tensions between the proposal and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was announced last year as part of the Obama administration's shift of focus toward Asia, the region with the fastest-growing economy.
One of the stops on President Obama's just-completed trip to Asia was in Thailand, in part to welcome its interest in joining the American-backed trade initiative, which has held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations.
China, on the other hand, has gone out of its way to express its support for the new proposed bloc. Its members would be the 10 countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, plus 6 nations that have free-trade agreements with the association: Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.
''We uphold regional economic integration, and this is a way to fight against the global financial crisis,'' Fu Ying, a Chinese vice minister for foreign affairs, said of the proposal at a briefing in Beijing last week, adding, ''We will actively support the negotiating process.''
Some analysts in Asia describe the Obama administration's trade initiative as one element in a policy to contain China, the world's largest producer and exporter of manufactured goods.
''China's exclusion is strange, given its huge economic presence in the Asia-Pacific'' region, Amitendu Palit, a visiting senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore, wrote in a recent edition of East Asia Forum. ''This has given rise to views that the United States is driving the Trans-Pacific Partnership with the strategic objective of marginalizing China.''
At the briefing in Beijing, Liang Wentao, an official of the Ministry of Commerce, said that China had studied the proposed bloc backed by the United States and had concluded that the bar for meeting its requirements was ''very high.'' He said China had not received an invitation to join it.
Mr. Obama alluded to it during a presidential debate, implying that one of its objectives was to set the standards for entry above what China could now meet.
''We're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards,'' Mr. Obama said.
One criticism in Washington of the proposal supported by China is that countries need to do little to join and would be allowed to continue practices like protecting state-run enterprises.

HEADLINE: Small Payoff In Expansion By Big Ten

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
Maryland accepted an invitation to join the Big Ten Conference on Monday. Rutgers did the same on Tuesday, expanding the conference's roster to 14 teams and its footprint to the East Coast.
The new additions would bolster the Big Ten's reputation for strong academics. Both universities are members of the Association of American Universities, as are all current Big Ten institutions, with the exception of Nebraska.
Their athletic heritages are mixed, however. The Rutgers football team has finished the season ranked in the Associated Press top 25 once in the last 35 years, although it is currently ranked No. 21. 
Maryland's football team has finished the season as a ranked team eight times in the same period. Its basketball team has had more consistent success, winning a national championship in 2002.
But the main rationale for adding the schools seems to be economic: the prospect that they would give the Big Ten, and its cable network, access to the New York and Washington media markets.
On that account, the decision may be questionable. Although Rutgers and Maryland are in densely populated areas, they also compete against a number of other Division I football programs for fans and attention.
Moreover, affinity for college football is considerably lower in the Northeast than it is in the Midwest or the South. Thus, the teams have fewer fans than most other current Big Ten members.
Last year, I conducted an analysis of the 120 members of the N.C.A.A.'s Football Bowl Subdivision, attempting to estimate the number of fans devoted to each program.
The analysis was conducted in two steps. First, I estimated the number of college football fans in each of the United States' 210 media markets, multiplying their populations by a factor based on the number of people who conducted Google searches for the term "college football" in each area. (Some markets, like Birmingham, Ala., have much higher college football avidity than others, like Bangor, Me.)
Next, the college football fans in each market were further divided between F.B.S. schools, based on the results of an Internet-based survey called the Common Census Sports Map. Thus, every college football fan in America was, in theory at least, mapped to his or her favorite team.
Although New York is the nation's largest media market, and although Rutgers is the most popular team in the New York City area, its over all numbers were just average by this method.
That's because only about 15 percent of New Yorkers are avid college football fans, among the lower figures in the country.
In addition, although Rutgers might be the most popular college team in the region, it hardly dominates the market, with many fans declaring allegiance to universities like Syracuse, Connecticut, Penn State or Notre Dame instead. Many New Yorkers are also transplants from other parts of the country, and bring their football allegiances with them. Only about 20 percent of college football fans in the New York region listed Rutgers as their favorite team.
Therefore, although there are approximately 20 million residents in New York's media market, only about 3 percent of these people are estimated to be fans of Rutgers football specifically. That's about 600,000 people.
There are also about 300,000 Rutgers football fans in other markets along the East Coast or elsewhere in the country, bringing the total to about 900,000.
But that's below the Big Ten average of 1.4 million to 1.5 million fans per team. Programs like Wisconsin, which is close to the average with 1.4 million fans, might not seem to have as much media muscle. But these universities often have the affinity of whole states unto themselves, states where college football is a religion on Saturdays rather than an afterthought.
Maryland does somewhat worse still by this method. Although it is the predominant college football program in Maryland, the state has little passion for college football. And the program has little following outside Maryland's immediate borders, where higher-profile teams like Virginia, Virginia Tech, West Virginia and Penn State tend to dominate.
My method estimated that the University of Maryland has just shy of 500,000 college football fans, which ranks 58th in the country and which would be lower than any university now in the Big Ten.
Maryland and Rutgers are not necessarily poor choices compared with some of the other logical alternatives.
I count five other universities that are A.A.U. members, that play in a major college football conference, and that are either within a current Big Ten state or border one.
Missouri, with about 1.1 million fans, is the most attractive of this group. But it recently joined the Southeastern Conference, after getting on-again, off-again attention from the Big Ten.
Pittsburgh and Kansas rank somewhere between Rutgers and Maryland in terms of their fan counts.
The last two universities that qualify for the list, Iowa State and Colorado, have about as many fans as Maryland does.
The question, rather, is what the Big Ten stands to gain at all by expanding. Fans of a current Big Ten team might find their new schedules less compelling.
Wisconsin Badgers fans, for example, will now have fewer opportunities to see their team play against regional rivals like Iowa, Michigan and Illinois. Those matchups will instead be replaced by more games against Rutgers and Maryland.
Many college football fans also travel to road games, which bolsters business for local restaurants and hotels. It is about a three-hour drive from Madison, Wis., to Iowa City. But it is 15 hours to College Park, Md., and more than 16 hours to New Brunswick, N.J.
The sacrifice might be worth making for games against Notre Dame, Texas or perhaps even Missouri. But universities in the Northeast seem to reduce both the geographical integrity of the conference and the quality of the average Big Ten football game.
It is probably no coincidence that the two most popular college football conferences - the SEC and the Big Ten - have until now been the most conservative about expansion. The most recent additions to the Big Ten, Penn State and Nebraska, ranked as the 3rd and 18th most popular football programs in the country. The newest additions to the SEC, Texas A&M and Missouri, were ranked 6th and 23rd.
Rutgers and Maryland are outstanding public universities, but they are just not in the same league in terms of football.
The Big Ten may have expanded its revenue pie, but it will be dividing it 14 ways rather than 12, and among family members that have less history of sitting down at the table with one another. In seeking to expand its footprint eastward, the conference may have taken a step in the wrong direction.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Where Pilgrims Landed, Thanksgiving Is Kept at Table, Not Mall

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
PLYMOUTH, Mass. -- Here in the birthplace of Thanksgiving, where the Pilgrims first gave thanks in 1621 for their harvest and their survival, some residents are giving thanks this year for something else: the Colonial-era blue laws that prevent retailers from opening their doors on the fourth Thursday of November.
While shoppers in the rest of the country will skip out on Thanksgiving to go to Walmart or Kmart or other big-box stores, William Wrestling Brewster, whose ancestors arrived on the Mayflower and participated in that first Thanksgiving, will limit his activities to enjoying a traditional meal here with his extended family at his parents' house.
''Thanksgiving is supposed to be about giving thanks for all you have,'' said Mr. Brewster, 47, who runs a computer repair business. ''I cringe to think what society is doing to itself,'' he said of the mercantile mania that threatens one of the least commercial holidays. 
Some of the nation's biggest retailers -- Sears, Target and Toys ''R'' Us among them -- announced this month that they would be moving up their predawn Black Friday door-buster sales to Thanksgiving Day or moving up their existing Thanksgiving sales even earlier on Thursday. Walmart, which has already been open on Thanksgiving for many years, is advancing its bargain specials to 8 p.m. Thursday from 10 p.m.
But in Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the stores will sit dark until the wee hours of Friday. Even Walmart will not open in Maine until just after midnight Friday or in Massachusetts or Rhode Island until 1 a.m.
New England's blue laws were put down by early settlers to enforce proper behavior on Sundays. (The origin of the term is unclear. Some have said the laws were printed on blue paper, while others have said the word ''blue'' was meant to disparage those like the ''blue noses'' who imposed rigid moral codes on others.)
Over decades, many of those laws -- which banned commerce, entertainment and the sale of alcohol, among other things -- were tossed aside or ignored, or exemptions were granted. In some cases, the statutes were extended to holidays and barred retailers specifically from operating on Thanksgiving or Christmas.
Maine granted an exception to L. L. Bean, whose store in Freeport is open around the clock every day, including Christmas. When the blue laws, which had faded, were revived in the 1950s, the store in Freeport was already operating 24/7, said Carolyn Beem, a spokeswoman. She said that the store, which originally catered to hunters and fishermen who shopped at odd hours, was grandfathered in and allowed to stay open on the holidays.
Nationwide, a protest is developing against Thanksgiving Day sales. Workers at some stores have threatened to strike, saying the holiday openings were disrupting their family time. Online petitions have drawn hundreds of thousands of signatures protesting the move. The stores say that many of their workers have volunteered to work on the holiday, when they will get extra pay, and that consumers wanted to shop early. It is not yet clear what effect the protests might have.
At the same time, this corner of New England is serving as something of a bulwark against the forces of commercialism.
Even the Retailers Association of Massachusetts is treading gently on the notion of Thanksgiving sales.
''There hasn't been any outcry from our members over the years pushing this,'' said Bill Rennie, vice president of the association.
But, as Thanksgiving shopping becomes more common, he said, ''it may be time to have a discussion about it.''
Blue laws seem anachronistic when people can shop anytime online, he said.
There is also the case of simple economics. These states are already at risk of losing sales to stores in New Hampshire, which has no sales tax. Now, Mr. Rennie pointed out, they could lose even more in the holiday bargain rush when stores in New Hampshire are open and stores here are closed.
Still, Barry Finegold, a Massachusetts state senator whose district abuts New Hampshire, said that so far, none of the retailers in his district had asked for a change in the law.
''My phone has not been ringing off the hook,'' he said. ''In my opinion, it's not a national tragedy if Walmart can't open at 8 o'clock on Thanksgiving Day.''
Even several shoppers at Plymouth's Walmart Supercenter said they did not want the store open on Thursday.
''Leave the holidays alone,'' said Carole A. Maiona, 72, a retired medical records worker, as her husband wheeled a shopping cart out of the store the other day. ''The family should be together and not out shopping and supplying Walmart or whoever with more money.''
William Lorenzo, 35, who serves in the Coast Guard, said Thanksgiving sales were unfair to employees. ''It's not very American to make these people work on a holiday,'' he said, packing his groceries into his van.
His wife, Nicole, 33, agreed -- to a point. She confessed that she went shopping last year at 5 a.m. on Black Friday. ''I don't go just to go,'' she said. ''But if I can get a better deal -- we're a family of five, one income -- if I can get a deal, I'll get the deal.''
Some shoppers said they were so eager for bargains that they would drive to New Hampshire on Thanksgiving.
''We're going,'' said Jen Gallagher, 34, who works in grant management. Early odd-hour shopping has, for her, become a tradition.
''I like the hustle and bustle of it,'' she said. Her husband stays home with the children, ''and I sneak out,'' she said. ''And before anybody wakes up, I'm done, the gifts are hidden.''
Beyond the malls, Plymouth has its version of a Thanksgiving mob scene. The Plimoth Plantation, a living museum (spelled the old-fashioned way) that tells the story of the original colonists, draws about 4,000 visitors on Thanksgiving Day, about half of whom will have dinner there.
A family does not have to have come over on the Mayflower to appreciate Thanksgiving here. Olly deMacedo, who came to this country from the Cape Verde islands in 1966 when he was 7, started his journey on a freighter. Now, he is a driving force behind the town's annual Thanksgiving celebration, which includes a parade, food festival and concerts. All are held the weekend before Thanksgiving -- 200,000 people came this year -- so as not to interfere with the day itself.
''To have the parade on Thursday, or shopping on Thursday, would pull people away from the very thing we're celebrating,'' Mr. deMacedo said.
Among those in the parade Saturday was Rebecca Tuchak, 33, a restaurant manager, who was dressed in Pilgrim garb and riding a float that honored the first Thanksgiving. As she held her 3-month-old daughter, she said she had been staggered to learn that of the original 102 Mayflower passengers, about half had died during their first winter here.
''It's amazing to think of all the things we have and all the things they didn't have, and yet they still gave thanks,'' she said. ''I don't think you'll find a group of people more against opening stores on Thanksgiving than us.''

HEADLINE: An Anniversary Party for a Man and His Restaurant

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
MONACO
RENÉ REDZEPI said he was managing the economic crisis pretty well. At his little restaurant in Copenhagen, he said, laughing, he was getting 100,000 reservation requests a month. Of course, then it clicked: this unassuming young man of 34, lightly bearded, runs the hottest restaurant in the world, Noma.
And he was here, happily, along with 240 or so other chefs from 27 countries, to help honor Alain Ducasse, 56, the godfather of French cuisine, who invited confrères and consoeurs to celebrate his 25th anniversary running the three-star restaurant here, Louis XV. ''I grew up with Alain Ducasse, reading his books, dreaming of going to his restaurants, and I'm still at the stage that I don't really believe that I'm in the same category,'' Mr. Redzepi said.
''What's important is to keep such a high level for such a long time,'' he added. ''What happened to me is a bit freakish, but it gave me the freedom to cook what I want.'' 
His friend Magnus Nilsson, 29, who opened his Faviken restaurant in northern Sweden after four years in Paris at L'Astrance, said he thought his first invitation from Mr. Ducasse was junk mail, and it was not until a paper copy arrived that he believed it. ''His restaurants have been around a long time, so people don't talk of him in quite the same way, though they're better now than ever,'' he said. ''And when you take away all the 'chichi,' it's a business transaction: when you take their money, people expect pleasure in return.''
There was plenty of ''chichi'' here last weekend, with chefs coming from the United States, China, Japan and all over France, collectively holding some 300 Michelin stars, for a celebration including a lavish dinner that highlighted the vegetables, fish and game from the region. And there was plenty of what the British satirical magazine Private Eye calls ''luvvies'' -- highly complimentary comments about a star from those in the same industry, including rivals like Joël Robuchon.
Guy Savoy, one of France's finest chefs, many of whom came here to pay a kind of homage, said that ''Ducasse shows us tonight that he's the leader of French gastronomy in the world.'' Only Mr. Ducasse could have gathered together so many distinguished chefs, he said. ''His organizational talent is also extraordinary,'' Mr. Savoy said. ''Chapeau!''
The food at Saturday's dinner, served to more than 400 people, was both regional and refined. Papery sliced raw baby vegetables of the area -- 15 of them, including fennel, eggplant and spiny artichoke -- were in a crystal glass to be dipped in an olive paste. Small gamberoni, or red shrimp, from San Remo were served with a seafood and coral aspic and a dollop of superb Chinese caviar. Then spelt with tiny artichokes and white truffle. Then local fish -- red mullet, scorpion fish, John Dory, sea bream, tiny squid and octopus, in a light fishy broth. Then a small pastry filled with game birds and chard, with a pungent salmis sauce, vegetables and a truffle salad. Then a dessert of cooked apple and wild quince, with an ice cream made with cream from local cows and a touch of salt. And for those who could manage it, chocolates and a hazelnut shortbread.
All of which was accompanied carefully by an extraordinary selection of spirits and wines, including Dom Pérignon Rosé Champagnes from 1995 (never marketed) and 2000, a Dom Pérignon from 1993, Cheval Blanc 2004 and Château d'Yquem from 1988.
Mr. Ducasse becomes politely annoyed with the recent hoopla around Spanish and Scandinavian chefs, feeling it underestimates the creativity within the tradition of French cuisine. But he invited some of the best of the world's chefs, from Mr. Redzepi to Michael White of Marea, Maguy Le Coze of Le Bernardin and Daniel Boulud, now of New York, as well as Patrick O'Connell from the Inn at Little Washington in Virginia.
There were some of the best from Japan, some of whom had trained with Mr. Ducasse, and from Beijing and Britain. And then there was Hemant Oberoi, chief chef at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, who quietly explained how he and his staff saved the lives of hundreds of clients on the night in November 2008 when the hotel was stormed by terrorists, and how he watched some of his employees die.
Mr. Ducasse is an admirer of other cuisines. He can rave for five minutes about ''the perfect soba noodle'' he had in a little dive at a Japanese train station, cooked over one gas ring. ''Oh, and the result -- perfect width, perfect texture, perfect density, perfect flavor, perfect temperature, perfect light -- the essence of soba!''
He has a thing about temperature: of the food, the wine, the nuts at the bar. He talks about how fine cooking need not be expensive, rhapsodizing in an interview about ''a perfect leek vinaigrette'' and lamb shoulder, ''the best part, but not a noble cut.'' But he also believes that ''fusion is confusion,'' and that French tradition, and French training, remain the foundation of haute cuisine all over the world.
Tom Kitchin, of the Kitchin in Edinburgh, worked for two years with Mr. Ducasse, as did Clare Smyth, who worked four years here and is now the chief chef for Gordon Ramsay's London three-star restaurant. Mr. Kitchin spoke passionately about France as ''the home of gastronomy and of haute cuisine.''
In 1987, Mr. Ducasse, only recently recovered from an airplane accident that immobilized him for at least a year, was charged with creating a Michelin three-star restaurant here, at the Hotel de Paris. He was 30. It took him 33 months, and it was the first three-star inside a hotel.
After 25 years, he said, ''it's the age of maturity, both terribly long and terribly short.'' But it is ''not a place to stop, not a repose,'' he insisted. ''Now it's important to progress.'' His current theme is modernity: ''less fat, less salt, less sugar, more local and seasonal products, less meat and more sustainable fish,'' he said. ''We must eat more durably and equitably.''
Amid all the talk, of course, there was the food and wine, which were a gesture of generosity to the community of chefs and guests, who included Prince Albert and his wife, Princess Charlene, and Princess Caroline. The Mediterranean market on Saturday showcased a stunning display of fish, vegetables, breads, cheese and wine, with some of the chefs making dishes that they had invented for the occasion using local ingredients (and, it should be said, quite a lot of truffle). Dong Zhenxiang of DaDong restaurant in Beijing, for example, took local lamb and marinated it in sesame and Sichuan spices.
One of Mr. Ducasse's slogans is ''simple, sain et bon'' -- simple, healthy and good. The weekend that he created for his colleagues was hardly simple and perhaps unhealthy. But it was most extraordinarily good.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Rose in October

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Builders in the United States started construction last month on the most homes and apartments since July 2008, more evidence that the housing recovery was gaining momentum.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that builders broke ground on homes in October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 894,000. That's a 3.6 percent gain from September. 
Single-family home construction dipped 0.2 percent to an annual rate of 594,000, down from a four-year high in the previous month. Apartment construction, which is more volatile from month to month, rose 10 percent to an annual rate of 285,000.
Applications for building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 2.7 percent to 866,000, after jumping 12 percent in September to a four-year high. Still, permit applications to build single-family homes rose to their highest level since July 2008.
''The overwhelming trend here is a housing market that has clearly shifted into recovery mode,'' Robert Kavcic, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.
Housing starts were 87 percent above the annual rate of 478,000 in April 2009, the recession low. But it was still short of the 1.5 million annual rate considered healthy.
The hurricane that struck the Northeast had minimal impact on the October figures, the government said, although it could delay some construction in November. Still, residential construction activity in the region could move higher soon after, when builders begin replacing homes destroyed by the storm.
The housing market has been making consistent gains this year, helping prop up an economy that is being squeezed by a global slowdown and looming spending cuts and tax increases.
Builder confidence rose to its highest level in six and a half years, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo. Their index of builder sentiment rose to 46 points this month, up from 41 in October. It was the highest reading since May 2006, just before the housing bubble burst.
Readings below 50 signal negative sentiment about the housing market. The index has been rising since October 2011, when it was 17. It has surged 27 points in the past 12 months, the sharpest annual increase on record.
Though new homes represent less than 20 percent of the housing sales market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in tax revenue, according to data from the home builders group.

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, again strongly urged Congress on Tuesday to ward off the sudden and severe combination of tax increases and spending cuts coming at the end of the year.
''Uncertainties about the situation in Europe and especially about the prospects for federal fiscal policy seem to be weighing on the spending decisions of households and businesses as well as on financial conditions,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York. ''Such uncertainties will only be increased by discord and delay.''
Citing several outside economic assessments of the coming tax increases and spending, he said ''a fiscal shock of that size would send the economy toppling back into recession.'' Mr. Bernanke summarized the Fed's recent actions to purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities and continue extending the maturity of its Treasury holdings. 
Asked after the speech whether the Fed would provide specific unemployment and inflation thresholds that would prompt officials to tighten monetary policy, as some analysts have expected, Mr. Bernanke said that officials were considering this and that he did not want to ''front run'' those discussions. He said one advantage of this approach would be to better distinguish between how the Fed thinks the economy is going to evolve and how the Fed will react to conditions.
But he also said that monetary policy was a complex process and that officials had ''an enormous amount of material'' at every meeting that might be difficult to boil down to just two or three numbers that represent when officials would begin to tighten policy. Even if they could do that, he said, it was unclear whether there would be sufficient agreement on the committee about which numbers would initiate a policy change.
Analysts have also been expecting that the Fed will start replacing its current program to extend the maturity of its Treasury holdings with straight purchases of Treasury securities. In his speech, Mr. Bernanke did not address this question.
He said that while the details of a Congressional agreement to avert a so-called fiscal cliff were important, so were speed and a general impression of a functional and cooperative legislative branch.
''The economic confidence of both market participants and the general public likely will also be influenced by the extent to which our political system proves able to deliver a reasonable solution with a minimum of uncertainty and delay,'' he said.
Financial crises are always followed by painfully slow recoveries, Mr. Bernanke said, but this recovery has also been hampered by several frustrating ''headwinds,'' including a healing but still scarred housing market, clogged credit channels, the European debt crisis and, perhaps most pressingly, fiscal gridlock in Washington.
He also expressed concern about the approaching debt limit.
The United States is expected to reach the limit on how much it can borrow in early 2013. The last time the debt limit was about to be reached, Congressional Republicans held the decision to raise the limit hostage until the very last minute.
''As you will recall, the threat of default in the summer of 2011 fueled economic uncertainty and badly damaged confidence, even though an agreement ultimately was reached,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''A failure to reach a timely agreement this time around could impose even heavier economic and financial costs.''
He said that averting the fiscal tightening at year's end should not preclude fixing the country's longer-run problems with the fiscal budget, which he said was on ''an unsustainable path.''
Avoiding a fiscal tightening when the recovery is still fragile would help bolster economic growth, he said, which would help bring down the deficit as businesses and individuals make more money and as a result pay more in taxes.
''At the same time, a credible plan to put the federal budget on a path that will be sustainable in the long run could help keep longer-term interest rates low and boost household and business confidence, thereby supporting economic growth today,'' he said.
Mr. Bernanke was also asked why the Fed does not lower or eliminate the interest rate -- already at 0.25 percent -- that it pays banks for excess reserves kept at the central bank to encourage more lending.
He said that Fed officials had not ruled out that idea but that so far it appeared the benefits would be very small and that there were concerns that eliminating the interest takes away a tool used to control broader interest rates.

HEADLINE: Obama's Moment

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Chattanooga, Tenn.
I was in Chattanooga, Tenn., last week, and people were still buzzing about an unusual duet heard on Oct. 13, using superlow-latency videoconference technology and the city's new gigabit-per-second fiber-optic network. T-Bone Burnett, a Grammy Award winner, performed ''The Wild Side of Life'' with Chuck Mead, a founder of the band BR549, for an audience of 4,000. But Burnett played his part on a screen from a Los Angeles studio and Mead on a stage in Chattanooga. The transcontinental duet was possible, reported Chattanoogan.com, because the latency of Chattanooga's new fiber network was 67 milliseconds, meaning the audio and video traveled 2,100 miles from Chattanooga to Los Angeles in one-fourth the blink of an eye. 
That cross-country duet is just one of many, many signs I'm seeing of bottom-up innovation happening in cities from Minneapolis to Chattanooga, where local Democrats and Republicans are coming together -- in Chattanooga's case to pass a $229 million bond issue to build a world-class fiber-optic grid that is spurring innovation and start-ups -- to grow lots of good jobs. There is a huge amount of innovative thrust building, bottom-up, in the U.S. economy today. If Washington could just get the macro picture right, you could see a real growth surge in America. We're just a couple of grand bargains away from something big.
And that brings me to the news. It's good to see the budget talks between President Obama and the Republicans getting off to a solid start, but we know there will be plenty of partisan fireworks before any deal is cut. With that in mind, I hope the president will reframe and elevate the debate. It is vital that he not frame this as a discussion of just new taxes and spending cuts. His guiding principle should be ''growth.'' Right now, the whole budget discussion reeks too much of castor oil -- and which side will have to swallow the biggest spoonful.
I get why the president needs to stress that the wealthy will have to pay higher taxes before he can go to his base for spending cuts to restore long-term fiscal balance. But here's what I hope we'll see more from the president: a sense of excitement, a sense that if we can just get this grand bargain done, we can really unlock growth again, we can really, as Mohamed El-Erian, the C.E.O. of the bond giant Pimco, puts it, ''restore economic dynamism, ensure financial soundness, and overcome political dysfunction,'' which collectively would have a huge stimulative effect. If everyone has to take their castor oil -- the rich more, the middle class some -- make them feel that it will enable us all to get stronger. Make them feel that we're embarking on a new journey -- not to punish but to solve, not to sock it to the successful but to create more abundance for all. Because the right mix of tax increases, spending cuts and investment incentives will spur more start-ups, lead to more risk-taking, inspire more entrepreneurship and create more jobs. Elections are win-lose, but successful negotiations are always to some degree win-win.
And that brings me back to Chattanooga, where, Mayor Ron Littlefield says, city elders looked themselves in the eyes 15 years ago and realized that ''we were a dilapidated city going the way of the Rust Belt.'' But, by coming together to make the city an attractive place to live and getting both parties to agree to invest in a fiber-to-every-home-and-business network in a 600-square-mile area, Chattanooga replaced its belching smokestacks with an Amazon.com fulfillment center, major health care and insurance companies and a beehive of tech start-ups that all thrive on big data and super-high-speed Internet. ''We've gone from being a slowly declining and deflating urban balloon, to one of the fastest-growing cities in Tennessee,'' said Littlefield. The fiber network now attracts companies that ''like to see more and more of their employees able to work some of the time at home, which saves on office space and parking,'' the mayor said.
How fast is that Chattanooga choo-choo? The majority of Chattanooga homes and businesses get 50 megabits per second, some 100 megabits, a few 250 and those with big needs opt for a full gigabit per second, explained Harold DePriest, the chief executive of EPB, the city's electric power and telecom provider, which built and operates the network. ''The average around the country is 4.5 megabits per second.'' So average Internet speed in Chattanooga is 10 times the national average. That doesn't just mean faster downloads. The fiber grid means 150,000 Chattanooga homes now have smart electric meters to track their energy consumption in real time. More important, said DePriest, on July 5, Chattanooga got hit with an unusual storm that knocked out power to 80,000 homes. Thanks to intelligent power switching on the fiber network, he said, ''42,000 homes had their electricity restored in ... 2 seconds.'' Old days: 17 hours.
That network was fully completed thanks to $111 million in stimulus money. Imagine that we get a grand bargain in Washington that also includes a stimulus of just $20 billion to bring the 200 biggest urban areas in America up to Chattanooga's standard. You'd see a ''melt-up'' in the U.S. economy. We are so close to doing something big and smart. Somebody needs to tell the Congress.

HEADLINE: Administration Defines Benefits That Must Be Offered Under the Health Law

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration took a big step on Tuesday to carry out the new health care law by defining ''essential health benefits'' that must be offered to most Americans and by allowing employers to offer much bigger financial rewards to employees who quit smoking or adopt other healthy behaviors.
The proposed rules, issued more than two and a half years after President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, had been delayed as the administration tried to avoid stirring criticism from lobbyists and interest groups in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. 
Insurance companies are rushing to devise health benefit plans that comply with the federal standards. Starting in October, people can enroll in the new plans, for coverage that begins on Jan. 1, 2014.
The rules translate the broad promises of the 2010 law into detailed standards that can be enforced by state and federal officials. Under the rules, insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people because they are sick or have been ill. They also cannot charge women more than men, as many now do.
''Thanks to the health care law, no one will be discriminated against because of a pre-existing condition,'' said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, who issued the rules with Phyllis C. Borzi, an assistant secretary of labor, and Steven T. Miller, the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.
The rules lay out 10 broad categories of essential health benefits, but allow each state to specify the benefits within those categories, at least for 2014 and 2015. Thus, the required benefits will vary from state to state, contrary to what many members of Congress had assumed when the law was adopted.
Most states are defining essential benefits to be those provided by the largest health plan in the state's small-group insurance market. However, to comply with the law, federal officials said, insurers must provide certain additional benefits, including dental care and vision services for children, treatment of mental health and drug abuse problems, and ''habilitative services'' for people with conditions like autism or cerebral palsy.
The proposed rules go beyond informal guidance issued by the administration last December, most notably by requiring more comprehensive coverage of prescription drugs.
Administration officials originally suggested that insurers would have to cover at least one drug in each therapeutic class. The new rules will, in many states, require insurers to cover two or more drugs in each class.
Stephen E. Finan, a health economist at the lobbying arm of the American Cancer Society, said, ''The proposed rule is an improvement over the bulletin issued last year, but still does not guarantee that cancer patients will have access to all the major cancer drugs they need.''
The rules limit insurers' ability to charge higher premiums based on age. Under the rules, the rate for a 63-year-old could not be more than three times the rate for a 21-year-old. Many states now allow ratios of five to one or more, the administration said.
The White House said it wanted to ''minimize disruption of rates in the current market.'' But the administration decided not to allow a transition to the new age-rating standards, and insurers said that premiums could increase substantially for young adults.
Karen M. Ignagni, the president of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said the White House needed to focus on the affordability of coverage for consumers and employers.
In the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama said he would lower annual premiums by $2,500 per family by the end of his first term. But after a quick look at the proposed rules on Tuesday, Ms. Ignagni said she was concerned that ''many families and small businesses will be required to purchase coverage that is more costly than they have today.''
The rules also give employers new freedom to reward employees who participate in workplace wellness programs intended to help them lower blood pressure, lose weight or reduce cholesterol levels. The maximum permissible reward would be increased to 30 percent of the cost of coverage, from the current 20 percent.
The rules would further increase the maximum reward to 50 percent for wellness programs intended to prevent or reduce tobacco use.
Rewards could amount to several thousand dollars a year, officials said, because total premiums in employer-sponsored health plans now average more than $5,600 a year for individual coverage and nearly $16,000 for family coverage.
The rules include several provisions to prevent discrimination against employees. Employers must, for example, allow workers to qualify for rewards in other ways if it would be ''unreasonably difficult'' for them to meet a particular standard. For example, if an employee does not meet a standard for cholesterol, the employee might qualify for a reward by following a nurse's recommendations for diet and exercise.
The new law seeks to protect consumers by limiting what they must pay for health care before insurers begin to pay. In the small-group market, these deductibles are limited to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for family coverage. However, the administration said that insurers could charge higher deductibles, if necessary, to hold down the overall value and cost of a plan, reflected in the premiums.
Cindy Mann, the top Medicaid official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said many of the new requirements for essential benefits would apply to private plans that insure low-income people on Medicaid.

HEADLINE: Beckham Still Changes the Game -- Financially

BYLINE: By ROB HUGHES

 BODY:
LONDON -- David Beckham may be preparing for his last hurrah around Hollywood, but as the athlete fades, his image-makers are keeping many balls in play.
In truth, his worth as a team player was on its way down when he left Real Madrid for the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. What he has been selling ever since is Brand Beckham. The official statement that Beckham, now 37, seeks one more soccer challenge has set off a gold rush in Australia, China, England and possibly even in New York, with the Red Bulls of Major League Soccer; all are linked to a deal that trades the last legs of Beckham for the dollars yet to be wrung out of his celebrity.
Good luck to whoever gets him, though; with his wife, Victoria and their kids ensconced in the California lifestyle, don't bet on the tenure abroad lasting too long. He will go where the brand is best served, but like it said in his departure note, he may come back to the United States as an owner. 
Certainly, he is rich enough.
His game might not be. In two places, Spain and America, his legacy changed the fiscal rules around soccer.
When Real Madrid signed him in 2003, the Spanish government was in the process of drafting a decree that changed the rules regarding the taxation of foreign workers in Spain. In effect, it let wealthy foreigners pay less in taxes than Spanish citizens and became known as the Beckham Law.
From that time until now, when the ongoing economic problems forced a rethinking of that decree, countless players and other highly paid V.I.P.'s got away with paying a tax rate in Spain of only 24.75 percent.
That rate is scheduled to jump to 52 percent, though Cristiano Ronaldo and others will doubtless not have to pay a cent if the employers cover it. Cristiano may still net his &#x20ac;10 million, or $13 million, but Real Madrid may have to double its outlay to keep him happy.
The pouting, rather than celebrating, after Ronaldo scored a goal a couple of months back was in part because of the wrangling over a new contract for him, beyond the current one that runs to 2015.
However, this is not so much about the current Madrid star. He has enough on his plate with a Champions League match against Manchester City on Wednesday evening.
Back to the Beckham effect. When Anschutz Entertainment Group, the owner of the Galaxy, wanted to take him to Los Angeles, it first had to persuade the Major League Soccer to break its salary cap.
For a second time, the Beckham name became attached to a change of financial allowances. The M.L.S. agreed to a ''designated player rule'' that, in effect, allowed Beckham, and then a few others, to be paid more than the rest of their teammates combined.
A hallowed principle in many sports in the United States, the salary cap, was altered.
By how much? That has been between the Galaxy and the Beckhams, but suffice to say, the soccer family easily afforded their $18.2 million home in Beverly Hills, close to their friend, Tom Cruise.
Come to think of it, Beckham also has a house in Dubai, so maybe the list of potential new grounds for his last hurrah as a player must embrace the Middle East as well.
We will hear soon enough whether all the talk Down Under really does mean David's ears are open to a stint there, perhaps for the 10 games that would remain of the Australian season by the time he would be available. Melbourne Heart and Central Coast Mariners have jumped aboard the speculation train, while the media are wondering whether Western Sydney Wanderers could rustle up the cash to sign Beckham as a rival attraction to Alessandro Del Piero, the Italian player who joined Sydney FC this year.
Beckham's signing off from the Galaxy, after the M.L.S. Cup match Dec. 1, means the league, and the endorsement companies, must find another face to carry them through the future. It might require some deep thinking because, while there have always been better players in the world than Beckham, none has his instant marketing appeal.
Even when Beckham was a part-time player, carried by Landon Donovan and the other Los Angeles players, his management group could sell him in the United States like no other soccer star. The same management, incidentally, just landed another coup in the United States after its new client, Lewis Hamilton, won the inaugural Formula One race on Sunday in Austin, Texas.
Meanwhile, back in Europe, where Beckham left his youth, the powers the players now wield are facing several new challenges.
One is the attempt to put financial restraints on a sport that, from its top clubs down, pays as much as 70 percent of its annual income straight into the pockets of players.
Michel Platini, the former star player who now is running Europe's soccer authority, UEFA, is intent on bringing what he calls financial fair play to the sport. By that, he means clubs should not spend, as some of them ruinously do, more on player fees and salaries than they earn through the game tickets and broadcasting rights.
Platini's rule should kick in starting next season. Some of the biggest clubs, owned by overseas billionaires, are hard at work inventing new ways of presenting their balance sheets.
In Spain, where Barcelona and Real Madrid command television fees way above all the rest, there is a gathering crisis at the gates. Even if people can afford the entrance price, there is now audible complaining about the salaries of the super-rich players.
Like Dickens's Oliver Twist, the players want more, more, more.
And some of them give less, less, less.
''It's not a good time to be a coach right now,'' opined Mauricio Pellegrino, who took the coaching role at Valencia in the Spanish league last summer. Pellegrino, an Argentine who played for the club, added: ''The players have more influence than the coach. Players have a value in the market for the clubs that the coach just does not.''
There might be exceptions to that. Pep Guardiola is halfway through his intended yearlong sabbatical in New York after leaving Barcelona, and the word is that Chelsea wants him to deal with player unrest in London.
Player power? Surely not.

HEADLINE: New Player in E.U. Data Privacy Battle

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- In the mid-1990s, Alan Shatter, a lawyer from South Dublin in the lower house of Parliament, played a role in bringing together diverse elements of society to lift a constitutional ban and legalize divorce.
This January, when Ireland assumes the rotating presidency of the European Union, Mr. Shatter, who is now Ireland's minister of justice, equality and defense, will take on another big challenge: putting together an agreement to extend the Union's 17-year-old data protection law to Web businesses and the digital economy. 
Mr. Shatter is Ireland's lead negotiator on the issue in the Council of Ministers, the legislative body in Brussels that acts as the European Parliament's upper house. The Union's 27 members are at odds over how to apply E.U. data protection laws in the digital world, and an agreement could require companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Amazon to provide the bloc's 503.7 million consumers with far greater control over their online data than people have in the United States.
An important part of the proposal, which is now before two committees in the European Parliament, would require Web companies to ask E.U. citizens for their explicit consent before collecting online data and tracking Internet activity used to tailor marketing and advertising to individuals.
The proposal, which was drafted by Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission, has been welcomed by E.U. privacy regulators, who are battling Google over its data collection practices.
But it is opposed by many large Web businesses, as well as by the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union. Opponents view the prior consent clause as an onerous condition that threatens an Internet financial model that relies on advertising to pay for content.
That has raised concerns among E.U. lawmakers, who are afraid that overly burdensome regulation would stifle Internet commerce and job growth.
Into this predicament steps Mr. Shatter, 61. In an interview, he said that he looked forward to working on advancing the data protection proposal, which has been packaged as a ''regulation,'' a rarely used binding form of E.U. law that would take effect immediately upon adoption in Brussels and apply to all 27 member countries.
''There is a need to improve trust and confidence to reassure people that their personal data won't be misused,'' Mr. Shatter said. ''Putting stronger data protection standards in place will make individual citizens across Europe more trustful of the technology and its use.''
Mr. Shatter said he would aim for a compromise that recognized the growing importance of the digital economy to the European Union, as well as the need for hard-and-fast legal protections for E.U. citizens, who are increasingly making their purchases and many everyday decisions via the Internet.
Without privacy constraints, those movements online can be tracked.
''I think it is possible to reconcile the legitimate and economically important activities of the advertising industry with privacy issues,'' he said. ''I don't think we can commoditize individuals and simply regard them as something of business value to be sold on.''
Such strict new rules would replace a law from 1995, which was conceived as more of a legal directive that effectively limited the possibilities of wide-scale data mining for direct marketing or other commercial purposes.
Because of the existing law's optional nature and a loophole allowing companies to collect data for ''legitimate interests,'' Internet companies have been able largely to evade the directive's principle of obtaining prior consent.
Mr. Shatter has been part of a lot of groundbreaking. His law firm, Gallagher Shatter, was the first in Ireland to represent and win a civil judgment for a victim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest, which it did in the early 1990s. Mr. Shatter, who is also a trained professional mediator -- a skill that could serve him well -- has published several books on Irish family law, as well as the 1989 novel ''Laura,'' a story about a custody battle involving a fictional politician.
But obtaining a consensus in the Council of Ministers, whose cooperation is important to passage of a revised data protection law, will not be easy, said Simon Davies, a founder of Privacy International, an advocacy group based in London, and a lecturer at the London School of Economics. Mr. Davies is advising the European Parliament on the legislation.
''The problem is not that the will to reform isn't there. It is,'' Mr. Davies said. ''Everyone agrees in principle that we need to do this, but the devil is in the details. When you move into the details you find major ideological divides on both sides.''
Ireland, with its educated work force and 15 percent corporate income tax rate, has become the European base for U.S. technology giants, including Microsoft, Facebook and Google.
In the past, the country's data protection commissioners have attempted to mediate disputes over privacy issues between data protection hard-liners from Germany and France, and those advocating less regulation, like Britain.
Mr. Shatter said Ireland had a ''pivotal role'' to play in resolving outstanding online privacy issues. Final adoption of a new data protection law is unlikely to take place before the second half of next year, when Ireland will no longer hold the E.U. presidency. At best, Mr. Shatter can aim to win consensus on the main issues: prior consent and an effective enforcement mechanism that relies on substantial fines.
Mr. Shatter said the prior consent requirement was essential for the law to gain political backing, as were details on how to penalize companies financially if they ignored the law.
Currently, most national regulators can levy limited fines of only a few thousand, or in rare cases, a few hundred thousand, euros, the equivalent of a rounding error in the profits of many global technology companies.
The current proposal puts more bite into those penalties, allowing regulators to assess fines of as much as 2 percent of a company's annual sales.
''Without a legal regime that provides sanctions for rule breaking, rules won't generally be complied with by some of those engaged in Web-based businesses,'' Mr. Shatter said, without endorsing specific levels of fines.
That may not sound appealing to Web businesses, but Mr. Shatter is an optimist. His political slogan on his personal Web site is: Look forward with hope.

Wall Street halted its two-day rally on Tuesday, after Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said that the central bank lacked the tools to cushion the United States economy from the impact of spending cuts and tax increases to take effect next year.
Mr. Bernanke, in comments before the Economic Club of New York, said that the Fed did not have the ability to offset the damage that would result if politicians failed to reach a deal to prevent a series of mandatory tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to go into effect early next year. 
His statement caused a downdraft in the market, though the equity market cut most of its losses before the end of the day.
''This is a more realistic and pragmatic picture of where we are, compared to what we've been hearing for the past couple of days from politicians,'' said James Dailey, portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pa.
Stocks rallied for the last two sessions after Washington politicians sounded an encouraging note that a deal on fiscal issues could be reached. Those two days of gains came after two weeks of sharp losses that pushed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down through the 200-day moving average, a crucial benchmark of the market's long-term trend. The S.& P. ended Tuesday near that level, which was 1,382.68.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 7.45 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 12,788.51. But the S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq each rose, albeit barely. The S.& P. gained 0.07 percent, to 1,387.81. The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.02 percent, to 2,916.68.
The day's biggest disappointment was Hewlett-Packard, whose stock sank to a 10-year low after the company swung to a fourth-quarter loss and announced a $5 billion charge related to ''accounting improprieties.'' H.P. stock slid 12 percent to close at $11.71.
H.P., whose stock is one of 30 on the Dow, said it took an $8.8 billion charge in the quarter, with $5 billion related to its acquisition of the software maker Autonomy, citing ''serious accounting improprieties.'' H.P.'s market value is now $23 billion, compared with $100 billion just two years ago.
Shares of Best Buy fell 13 percent after the company reported a net loss of $13 million for the third quarter on weaker-than-expected sales at its established stores.
Another factor weighing on stocks was the reduction of France's sovereign rating by Moody's Investors Service, a move announced after the market's close on Monday. Moody's cited an uncertain fiscal outlook as a result of the weakening economy.
''This brings forward a whole new set of problems to the euro zone issue,'' Mr. Dailey said. ''When the lifeguards -- in this case, Germany and France -- are in trouble, when they need to save people like Greece and Spain, that could be a big concern.''
Also on Tuesday, data showed that United States housing starts rose to their highest rate in more than four years in October, suggesting that the housing market's recovery was gaining momentum, even though permits for future construction fell. An index of housing-related shares shot up 2.5 percent.
Advancers outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of about 4 to 3. On Nasdaq, the opposite trend took hold, with about 13 stocks falling for every 12 that rose.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 16/32, to 99 20/32, and the yield rose to 1.67 percent, from 1.61 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: New York Sues Credit Suisse Over Mortgages

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sued the Credit Suisse Group on Tuesday, accusing it of misleading investors in mortgage-backed securities.
The lawsuit claims that Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest bank after UBS, misrepresented the quality of loans underlying residential mortgage-backed securities it sponsored and underwrote in 2006 and 2007, costing investors $11.2 billion. 
The bank, which is based in Zurich, did not adequately evaluate the loans and ignored the defects its limited review uncovered, the lawsuit said. The suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, also said the bank did not perform promised due diligence. The lawsuit was brought under the Martin Act, a New York securities fraud statute.
Jack Grone, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in the United States, declined to comment. The bank announced a management shake-up on Tuesday.
The lawsuit, which seeks damages, restitution and other relief, is the latest action by a working group created by President Obama to pursue wrongdoing that led to the 2008 financial crisis.
Mr. Schneiderman, co-chairman of the group, called the suit ''another significant step in our efforts to hold financial institutions accountable for the misconduct that led to the worst financial crisis in nearly a century.''
On Friday, the bank agreed to pay $120 million to settle federal civil accusations that it misled investors in the sale of risky mortgage bonds before the crisis. JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $296.9 million in a similar case. The banks settled without admitting wrongdoing.
Mr. Schneiderman also brought a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase last month over mortgage-backed securities packaged and sold by Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan acquired.
The working group's actions are viewed as a last effort for the government to hold banks and others responsible for misconduct in the mortgage business.
Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and other banks have already been sued by pension funds, insurers and others contending they misrepresented the quality of the mortgages underlying securities.

HEADLINE: Nashville Gambles on Lure Of New Convention Center

BYLINE: By BOBBY ALLYN

 BODY:
NASHVILLE -- Nearly four years ago, as Tennessee was hemorrhaging tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, the Metro Council here passed a measure to create a three-mile tax district around a site that will soon open as the most expensive publicly financed complex in the state's history: a $623 million downtown convention center whose campus stretches the length of more than a dozen football fields.
A keynote of Mayor Karl Dean's pro-development administration, the Music City Center is nearing its completion alongside a 21-story Omni hotel, for which the city is putting up an additional $128 million. The twin projects are just south of lower Broadway, the province of honky-tonk row -- once the city's seedy skid row, it has since emerged as the pulse of the country music scene. 
Although Middle Tennessee already has two convention centers, the Music City Center's 350,000 square feet of exhibit space is triple the amount of the Nashville Convention Center, which is just a stone's throw from the Music City Center, and exceeds Gaylord Opryland Resort's space by more than a quarter. Its 1.2 million square feet in total space positions it among the largest of its kind in the South.
At the time, Mr. Dean admitted that it was ''counterintuitive'' to pass a costly project on the backs of taxpayers while the state's jobless rate hit its highest point in decades. Yet with construction costs and interest rates at record lows, the mayor wagered that there was no better time to reap a greater share of convention business, capture new jobs and spawn development in the city's core. Plus, the taxpayers in this case would be tourists, not residents, since hotel rooms and other types of visitor spending within the three-mile zone would be charged fees that, over time, would pay off the project's debt.
Project boosters predict that the new center, which has been in planning since the late '90s, will lure hundreds of thousands more visitors a year to Nashville. ''The project is going to create a vitality that just radiates across downtown,'' said Ralph Schulz, who leads Nashville's chamber of commerce. ''It shows that we're really banking on Music City. We think it'll be a great win.''
Worried that annual visitors will fall far below these estimates, some observers say there is a risk that the project will dip into the city's budget at the expense of other city services. Butch Spyridon, president of the city's convention and visitor's bureau, disagrees, saying the building will pay for itself by taxing tourists. Hotel bookings so far, he said, signal a declaration of faith in the project's prosperity. ''Our revenue streams are outperforming our projections,'' he said. ''We didn't need a bigger center because of our ego. We need a bigger center based on the marketplace, and this project will deliver.''
Colonizing four city blocks, the striking building, called a widescraper by some, has 150-foot-tall floor-to-ceiling windows and features an eco-roof with four acres of sedum plants to control water runoff. But some community leaders continue to question the wisdom of the project, whose 14-acre undulating roof is intended to conjure Tennessee's high hills and pastoral basins. It also has a 162-foot guitar-shaped structure that weaves vertically through the building.
''Nashville has always been a tourism city,'' said Jason Holleman, a city councilman who was among the minority to vote against the project. ''The question was whether we should build this to grow the tourism pie or immediately invest in mass transit and other infrastructure needs,'' he said. ''Our choice to begin with the convention center has somewhat delayed our pursuit of mass transit.''
Other critics note that rehabbing and expanding downtown's existing convention center, built in the mid-1980s, could have bolstered the city's exhibit space at a fraction of the cost. Even so, there is ample evidence to suggest that the project has already been a catalyst for new investment. The Country Music Hall of Fame, adjacent to the new convention center, is in the midst of a $75 million expansion expected to double its size. Real estate brokers say that demand has surged for parcels in the shadow of the hulking structure, with several hotels in various stages of development. And restaurants and retailers have also recently opened or announced expansions.
Advance bookings have surpassed 700,000 hotel room nights for the nearly 90 events that have reserved event space, the largest of which is the National Rifle Association, on track to bring in 50,000 attendees to Nashville in the spring of 2015. The auspicious signs, however, arrive amid a national downturn in convention attendance.
Despite that decline, exhibit space around the country has ballooned 35 percent in the last decade, according to Heywood Sanders, a public administration professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio and a longtime convention center scholar. He said cities were engaged in a sort of competitive arms race for exhibit space, regardless of weak demand.
Nashville, until the last decade or so, had overlooked its downtown in favor of low-density suburban sprawl. Although the new convention center is not expected to attract more city dwellers, it holds important symbolic value, said Richard Lloyd, an urban sociologist at Vanderbilt University. ''A project this massive is not exactly a Jane Jacobs-like investment in New Urbanism,'' Mr. Lloyd said. ''But Nashville was a city without a center for a long time. The project is demonstrating that the center of gravity is now moving downtown.''
Councilwoman Emily Evans said the Music City Center encapsulated the political difference between Nashville's current mayor and its former mayor, Bill Purcell. While both aspired to put Nashville on the map as one of the South's most popular urban destinations -- a desirable ''new Southern'' town that would entice new dwellers and visitors, each had a different answer.
''The previous mayor believed that it was residents that drove economies, not buildings,'' Ms. Evans said. ''The current mayor believes that attracting tourists, attracting visitors is the key to making the city grow,'' she said, adding: ''It's hard to believe that the convention center will create a particularly hospitable environment for living.''

HEADLINE: A Chance To Tackle Inequality

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
To judge by the newfound bipartisan chumminess exhibited last week, it seems suddenly possible that the president and Republican leaders will reach a deal before the end of the year to cut spending, raise taxes and prevent the country from toppling over the fiscal cliff and back into recession.
They may even achieve the long-sought Grand Bargain to trim $4 trillion from the budget deficit over the next decade, a surprisingly positive outcome to the long standoff between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
But as our leaders begin to bargain, they may want to stop and reflect on what's missing from their conversation. Consumed by the question of how big a government we can afford, they might want to give some thought to a more relevant consideration: How big a government do we need?
''That's a question that we rarely have the luxury to address,'' said Alan Auerbach, an expert on public finance at the University of California, Berkeley. 
In the spirit of turning a crisis into an opportunity, this is perhaps an appropriate question to ask now.
The American economy is facing enormous challenges, buffeted by the relentless tide of globalization and technological change and burdened by a rapidly aging population. To a large extent, our future well-being will depend on how the government responds, to what extent it cushions the blow for the most vulnerable and whether it helps workers adapt or leaves them to their own devices.
Two related numbers capture the nature of our economic challenge: one is $3,837, which is how much the annual income of the typical middle-class family shrank from 2000 to 2010. The other is 17.42 percent, the slice of national income captured in 2010 by the richest 1 percent of the population. That is more than twice the share they reaped 30 years before.
We do not fully understand the economic forces that have concentrated so much of the fruits of growth among such a tiny sliver of the population. What seems certain is that most of these forces will continue to play a big role in our future.
Globalization will keep the pressure on workers in manufacturing industries, putting them in direct competition with cheap labor in China and other developing countries. Technological advances will continue to replace manufacturing and clerical jobs -- in effect, changing the skill set required of the American labor force.
The best-educated and best-connected Americans are likely to continue drawing the vast majority of the rewards created by the new technologies and the financial wizardry in the vast markets opened by globalization.
This lopsided pattern of development is hurting us, many economists believe. It is undercutting the aspiration that every American should have a fair shot at progress. There is mounting evidence that our vast inequalities may breed instability and blunt the nation's economic growth.
There are things the government could do to help us deal with these growing inequities, spreading the bounty of the global economy more broadly and cushioning American workers from its blows. But that might require the government to be substantially bigger -- and taxes substantially higher -- than we have tolerated in the past.
President Obama's health care law was a step in this direction, ensuring that workers who lose their job do not lose their health care, too. There is more that can be done to build a broader and more robust safety net. Some economists, for instance, suggest adding some form of wage subsidy or insurance to encourage employment and protect the income of displaced workers forced to take a lower-paying job.
The government could also invest more heavily in education. American 15-year-olds ranked in 22nd place in reading literacy, 21st place in science and 29th place in math in international tests coordinated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the United States dropped precipitously in the organization's international rankings of college graduation rates.
Robert Reich, a political economist at Berkeley who served as labor secretary in Bill Clinton's administration, suggests increasing the mandatory education to 14 years, including two years of universal community college to equip workers with the new skills required by a changing economy. Many economists recommend that the government support continual training, which companies are reluctant to engage in lest newly trained workers be poached by competitors.
Government can play a role fostering the well-paid jobs that will support the middle class of the future. Lawrence Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard, suggests that the government use the leverage of Medicare to encourage hospitals and nursing homes to employ well-paid, highly trained nurses and aides. Robert Frank, an economics professor at Cornell, adds that renewal of the nation's dilapidated infrastructure is an obvious place to look for good jobs.
To the extent that the hypercompetitive global economy condemns a larger share of the American labor force to low-end service jobs, the government may have to provide more direct support.
N. Gregory Mankiw a professor of economics at Harvard who headed the Council of Economic Advisers during the administration of George W. Bush, frames our choice succinctly.
''If we want a robust social safety net along the lines of many Western European countries, we will eventually need taxes on the middle class similar to what you see in many of those countries,'' Mr. Mankiw wrote in an e-mail. ''If that tax burden is deemed unacceptable, then the American people will have to rethink the social safety net.''
So far, the debate in Washington has focused on only one side of the proposition. From the abortive deal negotiated between President Obama and Speaker John Boehner last year, which was dropped in the face of conservative opposition, to the plan proposed earlier this year by Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and former Republican vice-presidential candidate, every fiscal reform plan assumes that government spending on entitlements and other programs must be cut.
But that is not the only way to think about our conundrum. For instance, Bruce Bartlett, a tax expert who worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, argues that raising federal tax revenue to about 22 percent of the nation's economic output would go a long way to protect many of our entitlement programs. Twenty-two percent of our gross domestic product might be more than we have ever paid in federal taxes. It is much higher than the historical average of 18.5 percent.
But this amount is still well below the levels of the more generous social democracies in Europe. And we can afford them.
''Globalization creates winners and losers,'' Mr. Reich said. ''But the winners can compensate the losers and still be ahead.''
It is not too late to take our focus off shrinking the safety net we have now to debate how we can pay for an adequate one.

HEADLINE: Steep Climb To Revenue If Loopholes Are the Path

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Whether to raise revenue through increasing tax rates or cutting loopholes has become a central sticking point in the negotiations on a major debt deal.
The White House has drawn one line in the sand: it argues that tax rates must go up on income above $250,000 a year, because reducing tax breaks for the affluent cannot on its own raise the $1.6 trillion in additional revenue it seeks. Congressional Republicans have drawn another line: they might accept higher revenue, but only through the reduction of tax breaks.
But is it even possible to raise $1.6 trillion from wealthy households without changing tax rates? Experts say it is. But doing so might be politically infeasible and hugely unpopular, because it would involve wiping out nearly every deduction, credit and preferential rate those affluent households claim. 
''Getting $1.6 trillion on the individual side, only through rolling back tax expenditures?'' said Donald Marron, the director of the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based research group. ''It's a heavy lift.''
Wiping out all tax expenditures -- the official name for the deductions, credits and other loopholes addling the tax code -- for the top 2 percent of earners would raise about $2 trillion over 10 years. (Tax expenditures for all households cost the government about $1 trillion a year, because middle-class and low-income families also benefit.)
But doing so would mean that a family earning just over $250,000 a year might face a sharply higher tax bill than a household earning just under that amount. A phase-in, which most analysts consider unavoidable, might slash $300 billion from the revenue pot, leaving roughly $1.7 trillion, just over what the White House seeks.
That means that any proposal raising $1.6 trillion would involve getting rid of nearly every loophole or break in the code for high-income families -- not just itemized deductions, but also preferential rates on investment income and every tax credit the wealthy can currently claim.
There would be no deduction for charitable giving, or close to none, angering wealthy donors and nonprofit directors. The home mortgage interest deduction would vanish, hurting the housing market just as it has started to turn around. Preferential tax treatment of capital gains and dividends would disappear, probably throwing the markets into a sell-off. The top 1 percent of earners might see their after-tax income fall as much as 19.8 percent, according to calculations by the Tax Policy Center.
This is a large part of the reason that the White House has argued for allowing the top two marginal rates to rise to the Clinton-era levels, with a top rate of 39.6 percent. Such an increase would reduce the deficit by nearly $1 trillion over 10 years and allow for a deal that caps deductions, rather than eliminates all of them.
Although the politics remain difficult, tax experts say they can identify a number of plausible routes to agreement between Republicans and Democrats.
For one, the White House could agree to a lower revenue target -- say, $1 trillion over 10 years, or $1.2 trillion -- allowing for a more moderate package of tax increases on the wealthy.
Second, tax rates could rise for the top two brackets, not to their Clinton-era rates, but to a few percentage points below them. A top rate might climb to 37 percent, rather than 39.6 percent, from the current 35 percent. That would still increase revenue by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years, making the rest of the tax math easier.
Republicans and Democrats might also agree to a broad cap on all deductions for a household, an option that negotiators on the Hill said holds promise for both sides. For one, limiting deductions would avoid the thorny negotiations on which tax expenditures to eliminate.
With some higher rates and limits to loopholes, experts say many different plans could raise an additional $1 trillion to $1.6 trillion in revenue over 10 years.
The centrist research group Third Way ran the numbers on a White House proposal to let the Bush-era tax cuts on the top two rates expire, for example. Third Way also imagined increasing the estate tax, limiting the value of itemized deductions and carrying out the ''Buffett Rule,'' which ensures that households earning more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. That package of changes increased revenue by about $1.6 trillion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: Putin, in Need of Cohesion, Pushes Patriotism

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Anna Kordunsky contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Over 12 years as the principal leader of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin has brought the same ruthless pragmatism to a wide range of problems -- separatist wars, gas wars, rebellious oligarchs and a collapsing ruble.
Now he is facing a problem he has never encountered before, one that is an awkward fit with his skeptical, K.G.B.-trained mind. Six months into his third presidential term, after a wave of unsettling street protests, Mr. Putin needs an ideology -- some idea powerful enough to consolidate the country around his rule.
One of the few clear strategies to emerge in recent months is an effort to mobilize conservative elements in society. Cossack militias are being revived, regional officials are scrambling to present ''patriotic education'' programs and Slavophile discussion clubs have opened in major cities under the slogan ''Give us a national idea!''
''Definitely he is thinking about ideology,'' Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin's press secretary and close aide, said in an interview. ''Ideology is very important. Patriotism is very important. Without dedication from people, without the trust of people, you cannot expect a positive impact of what you are doing, of your job.'' 
Ideas are changing inside the ruling class, as well. The pro-Western, modernizing doctrine of President Dmitri A. Medvedev has been replaced by talk about ''post-democracy'' and imperial nostalgia. Leading intellectuals are challenging the premise, driven into this country 20 years ago, that Russia should seek to emulate liberal Western institutions. ''Western values'' are spoken of with disdain.
Every year, scholars from around the world gather for a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, where they sit around an opulent dinner table, peppering Mr. Putin with questions for hours. Mr. Peskov said this year there were few questions about democracy and human rights -- because those questions are no longer of interest.
''World experts nowadays are losing their interest in the traditional set of burning points,'' he said. ''Everyone is sick and tired of this issue of human rights.''
He added, ''It's boringly traditional, boringly traditional, and it's not on the agenda.''
Events of the last year have breathed life into this anti-Western argument. The debt crisis stripped the euro zone of its attraction as an economic model, and then as a political one. The Arab uprisings have left Russia and the United States divided by an intellectual chasm. The Russian Orthodox Church casts the West as unleashing dangerous turbulence on the world.
Mr. Peskov said that Mr. Putin ''understands pretty well that there are no general Western values,'' but that he views this as a period of severe historic crisis.
''We have a tremendous collapse of cultures in Europe, less in the States, less in South America,'' Mr. Peskov said. ''But we have it in Africa and we have it in Europe, and they will be torn apart by these contradictions. Because there is no harmony in coexistence of different cultures, they cannot ensure this harmony.''
''The wave of revolutions in Maghreb, in the Middle East, in the Gulf, in Yemen, it brought disaster,'' he said.
While Russia has no intention of drifting from the West in its foreign policy and seeks closer bilateral relationships, Mr. Peskov said, it will no longer tolerate interference by outsiders in its domestic affairs.
This message is unambiguous, but it is difficult to know what concrete changes it may bring in a country whose top political and business figures have homes in Western Europe and send their children to study there.
In September, during a discussion on ''nationalizing the elite,'' a Kremlin-connected lawmaker proposed barring officials from owning property overseas, saying it makes them beholden to foreign governments and could lead them to betray Russia. The proposal met open resistance, including from Mr. Medvedev, and is now in limbo.
Mr. Peskov said Mr. Putin had mixed feelings about the measure and had not come to a final decision about it.
''If you work for the state -- if you are a state employee of a certain level especially -- and you have your investment outside, you can be easily influenced from that outside, and it can harm the interests of the state,'' he said. ''You are not safe, in terms of being firm in defending the state's interests. But on the other hand, if we are speaking about abroad, it is much cheaper to buy a flat somewhere in Bulgaria than here in Moscow. So there is a huge discussion about that.''
Alexander Rahr, one of the experts who attended the Valdai Discussion Club, said he left with the sense that though Mr. Putin has benefited politically by embracing more conservative language, there is something deeper going on.
''He is preparing Russians more and more for the understanding that Russia does not belong to the West, to Western culture anymore, or to Europe in the way that was discussed during the 1990s,'' said Mr. Rahr, the author of a biography of Mr. Putin. ''He is preparing Russians for something else. Whatever this means is very difficult to say.''
In public, Mr. Putin has lent his voice to the search for patriotic ideas. At a September meeting that started a national push for ''patriotic education,'' he said that conflict over ''cultural identity, spiritual and moral values and moral codes'' had become a field of intense battle between Russia and its foes.
''This is not some kind of phobia, it really is happening,'' Mr. Putin said, according to the newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta. ''This is at least one of the forms of competitive battles that many countries encounter, just like the battle for mineral resources. Distortion of the national, historic and moral consciousness more than once led the whole state to weakness, collapse and loss of sovereignty.''
That theme was reprised this month, on the 400th anniversary of the uprising that expelled a Polish-Lithuanian occupation, ending what Russians call the ''time of troubles.''
The message seemed tailored for this suspicious season, when nonprofit groups that receive financing from outside Russia are being labeled ''foreign agents'' and the legal definition of treason has been broadened to include providing assistance to international organizations. In a videotaped lecture that will be shown in high school classrooms, one of Mr. Putin's close allies, Sergei Y. Naryshkin, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament, describes the long ago Western occupiers to the accompaniment of dark orchestral music and images of a dead village girl, blazing wood cabins and a cowering child.
On orders from Moscow, Russia's state officials are scrambling to come up with their own patriotic programs. In Rostov-on-Don, the Ministry of Education is considering imperial-style 19th-century costume balls. Officials in Novosibirsk proposed a new holiday, ''The Day of Overcoming the Troubles.'' Volgograd legislators inaugurated a Commission on Questions of Patriotic Education, Ideology and Propaganda.
Sergei A. Karaganov, a dean at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said he believed that Russia would spend several years in a search for ''a unifying set of ideas'' under Mr. Putin's leadership.
''He is a very good operational thinker -- he is practical -- but at certain points you have to offer a vision,'' Mr. Karaganov said. ''It is clear what is happening now is the rebuilding of Russia's ties with its history, which were broken.''
One complication in that project, he noted, is that Russia's moments of glory and unity have always been associated with an invading force.
''Russia has a fantastic, very strange and very foreign situation -- the country has no enemies,'' he said. ''Your country was formed by a few words in your Constitution. Our country was formed around defense, and all of a sudden there is no threat.''

AS the holiday season approaches, the major airlines are signaling to some passengers to take a hike. At least that's what travelers might infer from the smaller number of flights being scheduled at many of the nation's airports.
Between 2007 and 2012, airlines cut the number of domestic passenger flights by 14 percent, according to the Department of Transportation -- with the biggest drops occurring at midsize and smaller regional airports. The five heartland hubs of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Memphis, Pittsburgh and St. Louis have lost a stunning 40 percent of their scheduled flights. 
The reason is simple: airlines have decided that the best way to earn a healthy return on their investment is to maintain tight discipline on capacity. That's a fancy way of saying they want their planes to fly as full as sardine cans. And the way they've been accomplishing this is by concentrating service on the big domestic and international markets and by cutting flights in smaller, less traveled ones.
That's smart business, of course. Why expend the same dollars on jet fuel, pilots and Sun Chips on a flight that's likely to leave half-empty from Memphis when you can trim the number of scheduled departures from the same airport and really pack them in on each flight?
But this, of course, leaves Aunt Sally in Sarasota, Fla., with fewer options to visit family during the holidays; it leaves millions of us with longer boarding and exiting delays on our planes -- and, yes, it helps drive up fare prices, too. It's that old rule of supply and demand. Travelocity, an online booking site, has found airline ticket prices for this pre-Thanksgiving period to be 10 percent higher on average than last year.
Unfortunately for travelers, this situation is unlikely to change anytime soon. With five airlines now serving 85 percent of the domestic market -- four, if American Airlines and US Airways merge, as industry analysts expect -- the major carriers are worrying less about the one factor that could disrupt their cozy, cram-'em-in strategy: competition.
That is, unless policy makers do what they should have done a long time ago and allow foreign airlines, including discount carriers like Ryanair and global players like Qantas and British Airways, to serve domestic routes in the United States. Why, after all, should an industry that has ingeniously used free-market principles to squeeze the most revenue out of each middle seat be protected from competing in a real free market?
As things stand now, the United States allows foreign airlines to serve its major cities as part of international agreements -- conventions that have been around for decades. Foreign airlines have never posed a threat to national security or to the safety of air travelers; there's no indication that such carriers have resisted American security measures in the past or any reason to think they'd violate any protocols required for domestic routes either.
Competition from foreign airlines would put downward pressure on wages, something that union workers may object to. But by reducing fares and expanding service, it would also increase the demand for air travel and related services -- thus, presumably, creating additional jobs during a time of persistently high unemployment.
Airline travelers, in fact, have already benefited significantly from increased competition among international carriers. Beginning with a successful agreement with the Netherlands in 1992, the United States has pressed for liberal free-trade pacts, called ''open skies'' agreements, with several nations.
In collaboration with Jia Yan of Washington State University, I have estimated that travelers have gained at least $5 billion annually as a result of lower international fares and additional flights generated by open skies agreements.
By allowing foreign airlines to serve American domestic markets, the process of creating a truly free market in airline services here would be complete and, as in the case of international markets, would provide travelers the benefit of more flight choices and lower fares.
Naturally, domestic airlines are likely to oppose such a policy. But they should realize that their current strategy to maximize profits -- reducing flights and raising fares -- runs the danger of alienating the American flying public and spawning new regulation.
One possible solution is to take a half-step toward opening up domestic markets and allow foreign carriers to serve any midsize and regional airport in the United States that has lost service in the past few years. New entrants would be able to integrate those markets with their international routes, something that could put many smaller American cities on the global business map.
Soon, Aunt Sally might enjoy the service on Singapore Airlines en route to Cincinnati. It's a short flight from Sarasota -- but the hot face towels are a dream.

HEADLINE: Clashing Views on Israel and Gaza

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It's time for Hamas and Israel to declare, accept and honor a cease-fire before hostilities escalate even more, and as of this writing diplomatic efforts aimed at a truce were under way.
It's time to heal. It's time to begin a process of reconciliation and ''to learn war no more.'' 
The Israelis and the Palestinians need to have the courage and determination to accept each other in human terms and to recognize the ties that bind them as neighbors and the suffering of each of 64 years of troubled history.
Israelis and Palestinians need to demand from their leaders a commitment to work sincerely in good faith for peace that will accommodate the legitimate needs of the other for security, reconciliation, justice and economic well-being.
For the sake of the children, and future generations of Israelis and Palestinians, peace can be achieved to ensure life and human dignity.
TOM KIMMEL Highland Park, Ill., Nov. 20, 2012
To the Editor:
''Hamas's Illegitimacy'' (editorial, Nov. 20) explains why a cease-fire will not be of long duration. As you point out: ''Israel has a right to defend itself, although it is doing so at the cost of further marginalizing the moderate Palestinian Authority ... and it risks further isolating Israel diplomatically.''
Thus, whenever Hamas decides to send rockets into Israel, it can expect a win-win-win result: it wins by terrorizing Israeli civilians; by provoking Israel into responding and thereby killing Palestinian civilians who are used by Hamas as human shields; and by weakening the Palestinian Authority.
Why then should Hamas not periodically use this successful strategy? The only way of stopping it is for the international community to place the blame squarely on Hamas for engaging in the double war crime of targeting Israeli civilians from behind its own civilians.
ALAN DERSHOWITZ Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 20, 2012
The writer, a professor at Harvard Law School, is the author of ''The Case for Israel'' and ''The Case for Peace.''
To the Editor:
Your editorial doesn't address the most crucial issue in the Israel-Gaza crisis: the continuing brutal blockade of the Palestinians by Israel.
Gaza remains the world's largest open-air prison, as Israel has continued to exercise control over it by land and sea and to starve its impoverished people of basic goods.
Hamas has committed war crimes by firing crude rockets into Israel. Yet the source of Hamas's hatred for Israel should be obvious. It is Israel, a much mightier military power than Hamas, that has perpetuated the terrible mistreatment and humiliation of the Palestinian people. That should be opposed by any human being with a sense of conscience.
DAVID LOEWENSTEIN Madison, Wis., Nov. 20, 2012
To the Editor:
You reiterate Israel's right to defend itself but then state that Israel's actions are ''at the cost of further marginalizing the moderate Palestinian Authority.''
What exactly should Israel do to defend itself against continuing rocket attacks other than destroy the source?
In fact, the Palestinian Authority has long marginalized itself. First, contrary to agreements in the Oslo accords, it has tried to bypass negotiations with Israel and gain recognition through the United Nations. Second, when it ruled the independent Gaza Strip immediately after Israel's complete withdrawal in 2005, it did nothing to better Gazans' lives, resulting in their support going to Hamas.
The Palestinian Authority is in the best position to advance the cause of peace by regaining its moral authority over Gaza and negotiating a permanent peace settlement with Israel. President Obama cannot bring peace to an entity that is not willing to make peace itself.
TONY WINSTON East Brunswick, N.J., Nov. 20, 2012
To the Editor:
''Brigades That Fire on Israel Are Showing More Discipline'' (front page, Nov. 19) makes clear the tragedy of the Palestinians.
As long as the dream of a Palestinian boy is to join a brigade whose only goal is to lob bombs and rockets at Israelis and to die as his father did doing the same thing, there is neither hope for peace nor the likelihood of a decent future for the Palestinian people.
Those who encourage the Palestinians to see the source of their victimization in Israel are only paving the road to this dead end. The true enemy of the Palestinians is the hatred of Israel that they and others nurture and encourage.

HEADLINE: Class, Take a Seat. And a Fork.

BYLINE: By PETE WELLS

 BODY:
WHEN M. Wells, a tin-can diner on a windswept corner of Long Island City, Queens, closed in the summer of 2011, its operators blamed its demise on a rent increase. I never believed it. The more likely explanation, it seemed to me, is that the restaurant had to die so New York could live.
As a light beginning to your meal, you could start with a half-dozen fat snails stuffed into the melting marrow of a long shaft of shinbone. After that delicate snack, you could get a little more serious by ordering an entire meatloaf with stroganoff gravy, spaetzle and foie gras. This tower of meat was meant to be shared by four people, but you could round out the meal with slices of buttered brioche weighted down with even more foie gras. That was a side dish. 
M. Wells posed a danger to more than the heart and arteries, though. Its chef, Hugue Dufour, advocated an approach to dining that was a threat to the work ethic that has made the city prosperous since it was called New Amsterdam. The gleefully unrestrained portions and liberal doses of fat and meat were an invitation to eat too much at lunch, get drunk in the afternoon, sleep it off for a while, resume consciousness again at dinner and call in sick the next day. If enough people had fallen into the M. Wells lifestyle, the city would have ground to a halt and our economy would look like Greece's.
But New York must have an immune system that keeps it safe from destabilizing outside influences, because M. Wells lasted just more than a year before the steak knives and the foie gras vanished from the scene.
Two months ago, Mr. Dufour and his wife and business partner, Sarah Obraitis, returned to haunt our 60-hour workweeks and our plans to live to retirement age with M. Wells Dinette, a new cafeteria inside MoMA PS1 in Long Island City. In homage to the building's past as a red brick schoolhouse, the dining area is set up like a classroom. There are long shared desks with composition notebooks tucked beneath the surface and even a few of those chairs with a built-in writing surface; others have a cage for books under the seat.
More forgiving than the restaurant it attempts to reprise, M. Wells Dinette is closed for dinner and seems to have scaled back its portions ever so slightly for daytime eating. But Mr. Dufour did not return to the kitchen to make cucumber sandwiches.
One weekend, a goat had been drawn on the menu chalkboard, its heart and other organs instructively labeled. (Another blackboard lists the wines, many of them French and all of them very helpful in putting away Mr. Dufour's cuisine.) The kitchen had bought a goat, butchered it, and was selling off the pieces.
By the time I got to the dinette on Sunday morning, just one leg and the liver were left. I chose the liver. With a rustic French sauce of vermouth and lardons, a mess of caramelized onions and a cushion of mashed potatoes holding everything in place, it was staggeringly hearty, the kind of thing you'd want to eat before setting off on a three-day bowhunting trip in Alaska.
If my hemoglobin count had still been low after that liver, and I was still hungry, I might have followed it with the blood pudding. This big slab, the color of a just-dug beet, was crunchy on the outside, with an iron-rich tang that was softened and sweetened by a buttery apple mustard.
The menus, which change daily, can be read as methodical studies in the uses of animal fat. Cured pork belly binds an expertly made terrine of rabbit shot through with pink ovals of foie gras. The rich oils of smoked herring bring depth to a surprisingly light Caesar salad with broccoli.
One of my companions described the thin slices of fried bread served with a classic brandade as ''crisp butter.'' There is also smooth, spreadable butter, on an open-face sandwich of bottarga served with a shot glass of the anise-flavored spirit arak, and flaky layered butter in the crust on a slice of Mr. Dufour's justifiably renowned Québécois meat pie, which overflows with the flesh of four or five species of animal.
A native of Quebec, Mr. Dufour learned his blithe disregard for moderation while cooking at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal, where he was also the pastry chef and an owner. Most of the time, his celebration of the unbridled joy of eating like a lumberjack is so convincing that I'd be prepared to split cordwood all day just to earn the right to pull up a chair.
I may have to do that, in fact, if I keep going back to M. Wells for the charlotte that appears in various guises. One day the pastry chef, Bethany Costello, had filled it with pears, mascarpone and a lake of salted caramel; another time she made it impersonate a black forest cake, with chocolate mousse below brandied cherries and a dark chocolate shell. In any incarnation, it is said to serve two. It could easily make six people happy, or four people ecstatic.
But at M. Wells Dinette, as at its forerunner, there are times when excess does not lead to success. There was nothing appealing about a veal cheek stroganoff -- not the crunchy, underdone mushrooms, not the dense and pasty torpedoes of spaetzle, not the largely flavorless meat and especially not the pools of grease that lay on top of the sauce.
Grease was also a major and unwelcome player in a bowl of onion soup topped with bland melted cheese. Get a dish like this, and you can start to wish that the kitchen put as much care into the fine details as it does into the broad strokes.
Then again, you might just accept the occasional greasy sauce as the price you pay for all the food at M. Wells Dinette that you'll never find anywhere else, least of all in a museum cafe. PS1 should be congratulated for landing a restaurant that suits the neighborhood, the museum's audience and, trickiest of all, the questing spirit of the work in its galleries. It's easy enough to imagine a contemporary artist butchering and roasting a goat as a performance piece. It's less easy to imagine the resulting feast tasting as good as it did at M. Wells Dinette.

HEADLINE: Insider Inquiry Inching Closer To a Billionaire

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Over the last half-decade, as federal authorities secured dozens of insider trading convictions against hedge fund traders, they have tried doggedly to build a case against one of Wall Street's most influential players: the billionaire stock picker Steven A. Cohen.
On Tuesday, the government appeared to inch closer to that goal. Prosecutors brought charges against a former portfolio manager at the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors in a case that for the first time directly involves Mr. Cohen, the fund's founder.
Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at CR Intrinsic, a unit of SAC, was charged with making more than $276 million in a combination of illegal profits and avoided losses by obtaining secret information from a doctor about clinical trials for an Alzheimer's drug being developed by the companies Elan and Wyeth.
The case is "the most lucrative insider trading scheme ever charged," said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, who brought the charges in Federal District Court in Manhattan. 
It also draws in Mr. Cohen, whose fund has been in the cross hairs of government investigators since the crackdown on insider trading began. Though not charged or mentioned by name, Mr. Cohen is referred to repeatedly in the government's court filings as either "Portfolio Manager A" or the "owner" of the funds involved. People briefed on the case confirmed that the reference was to Mr. Cohen.
Mr. Martoma worked closely with Mr. Cohen in buying and selling large blocks of Elan and Wyeth shares, according to a lawsuit also filed on Tuesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The government does not say that Mr. Cohen - who has not been charged in the case - knew that Mr. Martoma had confidential information about the companies' Alzheimer drug when he bought and sold the stocks.
"Mr. Cohen and SAC are confident that they have acted appropriately and will continue to cooperate with the government's inquiry," said Jonathan Gasthalter, a SAC spokesman.
From the middle of an expansive trading floor in SAC's Stamford, Conn., headquarters, Mr. Cohen, 56, oversees a fund that manages about $13 billion and, including borrowing from banks, possesses about $39 billion in total buying power. The fund, which has about 900 employees, has generated some of the best investment returns on Wall Street, averaging about 30 percent over the last two decades.
Though the case against Mr. Martoma is the first time the government has pointed to Mr. Cohen's participation in a trade that may have been improper, it is the latest in a spate of insider trading prosecutions of former SAC employees. At least seven former SAC employees have been tied to the government's multiyear investigation; three of them have pleaded to insider trading while working for Mr. Cohen.
Previous cases involving SAC have highlighted the firm's unusual structure: traders are allocated money and invest on their own with little direct input from Mr. Cohen. But in this case, Mr. Cohen is said to have had numerous contacts with Mr. Martoma and appeared to collaborate closely with him.
"The law of averages would tell you that all of these instances at one firm are not coincidences," said Mark Zauderer, a securities lawyer in New York. "People take their cues from the top, and these cases must reflect a culture there."
F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Martoma, 38, early Tuesday morning at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was released on bail after making an appearance in Federal District Court in West Palm Beach. Mr. Martoma, who has been unemployed since leaving SAC in 2010, is expected to appear in federal court in Manhattan on Monday and enter a plea.
"Mathew Martoma was an exceptional portfolio manager who succeeded through hard work and the dogged pursuit of information in the public domain," said his lawyer, Charles A. Stillman. "What happened today is only the beginning of a process that we are confident will lead to Mr. Martoma's full exoneration."
Also accused in the scheme by the Securities Exchange Commission on Tuesday was Sidney Gilman, a neurology professor at the University of Michigan. The S.E.C. said Dr. Gilman, 80, an Alzheimer's expert who helped oversee the clinical trials for the drug, gave Mr. Martoma the confidential information.
Dr. Gilman is cooperating with the government and has entered into a nonprosecution with the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, meaning that criminal charges will not be brought against him. Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Dr. Gilman, said that he expected the S.E.C.'s case to be resolved shortly.
Mr. Martoma met Dr. Gilman through the Gerson Lehrman Group, a so-called expert network firm based in New York. Once an obscure pocket of Wall Street, expert network firms became popular among the hedge fund set in the last decade as a way to gain an investment edge. The services linked traders to specialists and consultants in various industries.
But these firms came under scrutiny after the government brought more than a dozen insider trading cases involving these expert networks. In some cases, hedge fund managers paid outside consultants handsome fees for providing confidential information about publicly traded companies. In others, the government charged executives at the expert network firms with knowingly facilitating the exchange of illegal stock tips.
A spokesman for Gerson Lehrman declined to comment. The government's complaint details how Dr. Gilman hid his communications about the trial from the expert network firm.
Dr. Gilman's consulting work for Mr. Martoma earned him about $108,000, according to court filings. Based in part on Dr. Gilman's leaks about positive developments related to the clinical trials of a new Alzheimer's drug, SAC accumulated a roughly $700 million position in the stocks of Wyeth and Elan, according to the government.
The S.E.C. said that the fund's owner, Mr. Cohen, took a large position in Wyeth and Elan in his personal portfolio based on Mr. Martoma's recommendation. Mr. Cohen maintained his holdings even though there was significant debate about the wisdom of such a large position in the companies, the government said.
But in July 2008, as the trials neared completion, Dr. Gilman told Mr. Martoma that patients were experiencing serious side effects, prosecutors say. Afterward, Mr. Martoma e-mailed Mr. Cohen, telling him "it's important" that they speak. They spoke on the phone for nearly 20 minutes, the government says, and Mr. Martoma told his boss that he was no longer "comfortable" with the investments.
The following day, SAC reversed course. Mr. Cohen's head trader sold the firm's entire inventory of roughly 10.5 million shares of Elan and about seven million shares of Wyeth, the government said. Once it had dumped the shares, SAC built a short position in the two stocks, betting their value would drop.
According to the S.E.C., the trader, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Martoma kept the sales confidential. The trade, wrote the head trader in an e-mail to Mr. Cohen, "was executed quietly and efficiently over a four-day period through algos and darkpools" - referring to trades using algorithms and to trading platforms that do not have the same reporting requirements as the stock exchanges - "and booked into two firm accounts that have very limited viewing access."
After the companies announced the results of the trials, Elan's stock fell about 42 percent and Wyeth's about 12 percent.
The trading allowed SAC to avoid about $194 million in losses and earn about $83 million in profits on Elan and Wyeth, according to prosecutors.
At the end of 2008, Mr. Martoma received a bonus of about $9.3 million, the S.E.C. said. Mr. Martoma's stock picks were less successful in 2009 and 2010, and he received no bonuses then.
According to the government, in 2010 an SAC executive suggested in an e-mail that the firm let Mr. Martoma go, describing him as a "one-trick pony."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: H.P. Takes Huge Charge on 'Accounting Improprieties' at Autonomy

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: ]In Wednesday's New York Times, Quentin Hardy and Michael J. de la Merced report on Hewlett-Packard's accusations that Autonomy, a British software maker it purchased a year ago, had engaged in "serious accounting improprieties." 

 BODY:
In Wednesday's New York Times, Quentin Hardy and Michael J. de la Merced report on Hewlett-Packard's accusations that Autonomy, a British software maker it purchased last year, had engaged in "serious accounting improprieties." Before the deal, H.P. says, Autonomy inflated its sales; the problems went undetected by outside accountants - both Autonomy's auditors and a firm H.P. hired to vet the deal. 
The news came on the day that Hewlett released its quarterly earnings report. The company reported a $6.9 billion loss, dragged down by the Autonomy mess and continuing problems in the business that resulted in an overall charge of $8.8 billion. On Tuesday, the stock continued falling, dropping 12 percent to less than $12, its lowest point since 2002.
Now, the Autonomy matter has been referred to regulators in two countries, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened a case, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. H.P. is also considering its own legal action. "This took time" to uncover, said Meg Whitman, H.P.'s chief executive. The issues, she said, "were designed to be hidden."
On DealBook, Peter Eavis reports that the accusations are eerily reminiscent of accounting missteps uncovered at software firms during the tech bubble over a decade ago, suggesting that there is something about the software business that makes it easier for executives to indulge in questionable accounting.
Hewlett can't escape the onslaught of bad news. In recent years, what was once a giant of Silicon Valley has been buffeted by management turnover, board controversy and waning profits. The company, which previously rivaled the likes of I.B.M., Cisco and SAP, has watched the value of its stock erode sharply.
Even before the accounting problems, the acquisition of Autonomy, which sells software that examines data for patterns, looked troubled. Within weeks, the deal contributed to the downfall of the chief executive at H.P. and led to squabbles among company's directors, including Ms. Whitman, who took over in September 2011.

HEADLINE: Coal Boom Unabated in Asia

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: China and India lead in plans for fleets of new coal-fired power plants. 

 BODY:
The Green Blog news roundup included this graph and summary today:
Some 1,200 new coal-fired power plants are being planned across the globe despite concerns about greenhouse gas emissions from such generating stations, the most polluting type, the World Resources Institute estimates. Two-thirds of them would operate in China and India, it says. [World Resources Institute] [Read on...] 
Two related reports have come out in recent days.
One, the United Nations Environment Program Emissions Gap Report 2012, concludes:
Action on climate change needs to be scaled up and accelerated without delay if the world is to have a running chance of keeping a global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius this century.
The other was a new climate assessment produced for the World Bank. Here's the summary: "Climate Change Report Warns of Dramatically Warmer World This Century."
After I read it the other day, I sent this question to the bank's press office:
I disagree with Climate Progress blogger Joe Romm on quite a few fronts, but he's raised a very important point.... I'd greatly appreciate an answer from the bank on how it can put out such an urgent message on decarbonization while continuing to support coal-generated electricity (even if more efficient)?
Here's the reply, attributed to a World Bank spokesman: 
The World Bank Group only invests in coal in very rare circumstances. We have moved away from funding coal and have moved toward the funding of renewable energy. The Bank Group scaled up lending commitments for renewable energy from 22% of its energy projects in 2007 to 44% in 2012. When you talk about coal projects in the developing world, I think you need to put this in perspective. The problem with coal emissions rests squarely in the most highly industrialized nations. If you took all the developing countries in the world and added up all their emissions together, it still would be one-third of the emissions of the United States, European Union, and China combined - just one-third. We cannot deny developing countries their basic energy needs. We invest in coal only when poor countries have no other realistic options, including no short-term options to rapidly ramp up renewable energy alternatives.

HEADLINE: Why a Tax Crackdown Is Not Needed on Mortgage-Backed Securities

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: The rules on real estate mortgage investment conduits are designed to prevent operating companies from avoiding corporate tax. Banks and other financial institutions that originate mortgages should pay that tax. Passive conduits should not. 

 BODY:
Capitol Hill is poking around for tax revenue. One sleeping dog to let lie is the tax treatment of real estate mortgage investment conduits, or Remics.
These are the tax plumbing that allows the modern mortgage market to function. Most residential mortgages in the United States are securitized. This means that, as a method of financing the mortgages they originate, banks bundle together mortgages and sell them to a trust. The trust then issues securities to investors. The securities are backed by the mortgages held by the trust. The Remic rules allow the trust to be treated as a pass-through entity for tax purposes, avoiding the corporate tax in the same way that a mutual fund, pension fund or other investment conduit avoids an extra level of tax.
That is the theory. The collapse of the mortgage-backed securities market a few years ago exposed systematic failures in the transfer of title from the originator of the mortgages to the trusts. These failures included affidavits filed without personal knowledge (better known as robo-signing), lost mortgage notes, notes that were reported as lost when they were not, and mortgages that were never properly transferred into the trust or were transferred years after the fact. It's a mess. 
The legal process of transferring a mortgage is complex. It is rooted in property law, where protections were put in place to make sure that only a legitimate mortgagee had the legal authority to call the sheriff and foreclose on someone's home. Modern financial products do not always mix well with the more arcane aspects of legal process. And in addition to a morass of litigation dealing with shoddy underwriting practices and mortgage servicing, there is also a tax problem. 
Remics are pass-through entities for tax purposes that allow investors to take economic ownership of the mortgage-backed securities. The rules make sure that only passive holding vehicles, not mortgage originators or operating companies, avoid paying the corporate tax. One of the Remic requirements is that within three months of the trust's start-up date, substantially all of the trust's assets must be qualified mortgages. 
Two professors at Brooklyn Law School, Bradley T. Borden and David J. Reiss, have argued that many purported Remics may not in fact qualify as such. In many cases, they explain, mortgage originators failed to legally transfer mortgages into the trust. Instead, they argue, the failed Remics were probably taxable mortgage pools or perhaps publicly traded partnerships. This means that Remic investors would be subject to additional taxes and penalties. 
TheInternal Revenue Service began a review of the tax status of Remics last year, but it is unclear whether additional enforcement action is forthcoming. Mr. Borden and Mr. Reiss attribute this apparent nonenforcement to the so-called Wall Street Rule, part of the lore among tax lawyers that holds that after X million dollars of securities have been issued (and no one knows exactly what X is) and enough tax lawyers take the same position, the I.R.S. will not intervene and blow up the deals. 
What should the I.R.S. do? Tax liability would probably fall on investors, who might then turn around and sue the mortgage originators, servicers, law firms and other intermediaries, further gumming up the market for mortgage-backed securities. 
The Wall Street Rule is objectionable from a tax policy perspective when aggressive tax lawyers sanction a deal structure that contravenes the rules, or one that resides in a gray area but is contrary to what Congress intended. 
I do not think that is the case here. The Remic rules are designed to prevent operating companies from avoiding the corporate tax. Banks and other financial institutions that originate mortgages should pay the corporate tax. Passive conduits should not. The lawyers failed here because they relied too quickly on a client's representations about the status of mortgages in the trust, not because they were overly aggressive in their interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Instead of going after old, failed Remics, additional I.R.S. resources would be better put to use in policing the rules going forward for all types of securitization vehicles. 
Securitization vehicles have proved susceptible to abuse, not just in the mortgage context, but because of their simpatico relationship with off-balance sheet shenanigans, as in Enron.
Discovering tax noncompliance can serve as the proverbial canary in the coal mine, complementing the enforcement efforts of financial regulators.
For further reading on the tax issue, see "Wall Street Rules Applied to Remic Classification," by Bradley T. Borden and David J. Reiss.
For further reading on problems with the transfer of mortgages into securitization vehicles, see Professor Adam J. Levitin's testimony to the House Financial Services Committee in 2010, available here.

HEADLINE: Employer-Provided Health Insurance and the Market

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: As the Affordable Care Act takes hold, some employers will use their health insurance coverage to attract workers, while others will drop the coverage and use higher pay as the lure, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
The future of employer-provided health insurance is better considered together with the future of total employee compensation, both cash and fringe benefits like health insurance. From that perspective, the likelihood that most employers will continue to offer health insurance is not necessarily good news for employees.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Obama's initiative, offers large health-insurance subsidies to the majority of the population beginning in 2014, but only if their employer does not offer affordable insurance. The subsidies are frequently much larger than the subsidies coming through the tax exclusion of employer-provided health insurance. 
Some economists are predicting that eligible employees, especially those in line for the largest subsidies, will prefer employers who do not offer affordable insurance. As a result, they say, many more employers will not offer insurance.
Others have different expectations, pointing out that employers dropping insurance will pay penalties and throw away the tax exclusion for their employees who are not subsidy-eligible (typically the ones who earn more). Moreover, perhaps because people are comfortable with their existing coverage even if it is not subsidized, employer coverage did not decline in Massachusetts when it began a similar plan (by my estimate, only 5 percent of the people in Massachusetts who could get subsidized individual-market insurance actually receive it, largely because they have coverage through the employer of the head of the household or that person's spouse). Note that Massachusetts has lower subsidies and a narrower eligible population than the Affordable Care Act and lower employer penalties for dropping coverage.

How many employers will drop their coverage when the new health care law gets under way? The answer makes for a nice headline, but that's the wrong question. Would it be so bad if many employers dropped their coverage but replaced it with huge cash raises? Or would it be so good if every employer continued to offer coverage but required employees to take big pay cuts?
All sides agree that some otherwise subsidy-eligible employees will work for employers that keep their coverage, and other subsidy-eligible employees will work for employers that drop it. Market forces must be considered, because some employees will be moving between these two types of employers.
Low-income employees will ultimately cost less to employers without coverage (or without "affordable" coverage; the important issue is that their low-income employees are subsidy-eligible) than they cost to employers with coverage. If they didn't, low-income employees would be better off at employers without coverage and would line up to work there. Meanwhile, the employers with coverage would find it more difficult to retain and attract low-income employees. That situation defies supply and demand.
Another way to see the same result: by getting low-income employees at lesser cost, employers without coverage can, without going out of business, compete aggressively for the high-income employees who are considering positions that offer coverage.
By the same logic, high-income employees will cost more to employers without coverage than they do to employers with coverage. Thus, high-income employees will lose one way or another -- either they will lose their tax exclusion because their employer eliminates coverage or they will see their cash compensation fall below what it would have been without the Affordable Care Act.
At the same time, the low-income employees will enjoy the subsidy either way: either their employer drops coverage, in which case they receive the subsidy directly, or their employer increases their compensation above what it would be without the Affordable Care Act to attract them from the employers without coverage. Tax economists will recognize this as the Harberger model applied to the Affordable Care Act; international economists will recognize it as the Heckscher-Ohlin model.)
The same sorts of market competition will ultimately prevent most employers from dropping their coverage and thereby incurring the penalties. Employers keeping coverage will raise the pay of subsidy-eligible employees and get by with fewer of them. Those who remain will typically not want to leave for no-coverage employers because doing so would cut their pay. The same employers will hire a few more high-income employees at lesser pay, because for those employees, the alternative is a no-coverage employer.

HEADLINE: Court Allows Liquidation of Hostess

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: In granting Hostess's motion, Judge Robert D. Drain of the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York cited the need for a quick and orderly shuttering of the company to avoid letting its assets molder. 

 BODY:
A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved plans for Hostess Brands to wind down its operations, but there is little doubt that its best-known brand, Twinkies, will live on.
The company, whose corporate ancestors go back 82 years, said it would put Twinkies on the auction block, along with its other famous brands, including Ho Hos, Sno Balls, Ring Dings and Wonder Bread.
In granting the motion by Hostess, Judge Robert D. Drain of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York said it was important to have a quick and orderly shutdown of the company to prevent the deterioration of its factories and assets.
The company's chief executive, Gregory F. Rayburn, testified in court that he needed to lay off 15,000 of his 18,500 employees on Wednesday afternoon so that they could begin applying for unemployment benefits as soon as possible. He said such speed was necessary for maximizing the remaining value of the company. 
"From this point forward, I need two things to happen," Mr. Rayburn told the judge. "I need to maximize the value of the estate, and I need to do the best thing for the employees."
Wednesday's hearing came after a last-ditch mediation session on Tuesday between Hostess and its bakery workers union. After several hours of talks, the mediation efforts collapsed.
Hostess announced its intention to liquidate last Friday, and since then the company has received expressions of interest for its bakery brands from a wide range of potential buyers. Without naming names, an investment banker for Hostess, Joshua S. Scherer of Perella Weinberg Partners, said in court on Wednesday that they included regional bakeries, national competitors and retail customers along the lines of Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger.
Mr. Scherer added that his firm had plans to contact around 145 financial firms, including private equity shops and liquidators, to gauge their interest.
Investment concerns like Sun Capital Partners and C. Dean Metropoulos & Company, the owner of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, have already said that they are interested in buying some or all of Hostess's remains. Sun Capital has said that it would like to buy all of Hostess, not just its brands, hoping to preserve the company and improve its often-tense relations with its unions.
Mr. Scherer said that he expected asset sales to reap "significant values," perhaps more than $1 billion. Hostess had revenue of $2.5 billion in fiscal 2012, and a net loss of $1.1 billion.
Its famous brands have been sold and traded for decades among companies, including I.T.T., Ralston Purina and Continental Baking.
"These products will surely live on in one form or the other - because these brands are about as indestructible as Hostess's baked goods are," said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for executive programs at the Yale School of Management.
Hostess was unable to resuscitate itself during this bankruptcy, its second in less than a decade. When it filed for bankruptcy last January, it had nearly $1 billion in debt as well as labor costs and work rules that it insisted were unsustainable.
According to Mr. Rayburn, what sent the company into bankruptcy was both the refusal of one of its largest unions, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, to accept far-reaching concessions and a strike that the union began on Nov. 9, crippling two-thirds of the company's 33 bakeries.
The bakery workers union, with 5,600 workers at Hostess, repeatedly said that it saw no reason to grant a new round of givebacks - after having granted major concessions in the previous bankruptcy of Hostess - because it was convinced that Hostess was heading toward liquidation, with or without concessions. That union and Hostess's other major union, the Teamsters, repeatedly asserted that the company was mismanaged, having had six different chief executives since 2002. The unions maintained that Hostess's top management had done little to modernize the company's aging bakeries or its sugary product offerings - in an era when the nation has grown increasingly health conscious.
After filing for bankruptcy protection in January, Hostess demanded lower-cost contracts from the Teamsters, whose workers at Hostess average about $20 an hour, and the bakery workers, who average about $16. To help the company survive, the Teamsters, with 6,700 members at Hostess, most of them drivers, reluctantly agreed to a contract with numerous concessions. They include new work rules, an immediate 8 percent pay cut, a 17 percent reduction in Hostess's contribution toward health coverage and a suspension of its pension payments until 2015. In return, the company agreed to give its unions two of the nine seats on its board and a 25 percent stake in the company.
But the bakery workers' union resisted a similar deal, convinced it would drive down wages in the industry while in no way guaranteeing Hostess's survival. That union went on strike rather than accept that offer, hoping the company would bend.
A week after the strike began, Mr. Rayburn said he would liquidate the company.
The looming liquidation of Hostess has been a topic of debate, with many on one side criticizing greedy, stubborn labor unions and many on the other blaming what the bakery workers' president has called "vulture capitalists." The company entered its first bankruptcy in 2004 with $450 million in debt, and exited five years later with even more debt - $670 million.
"The private equity owners put this thing in such deep debt and asked for such deep concessions that it put the unions in a difficult situation," said Thomas A. Kochan, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "The unions weren't sure whether these concessions would be enough to salvage the company."
Hostess Brands has corporate roots going back to 1930, but the company has had that name only since 2009, when Ripplewood Holdings, the private equity firm that took control of Interstate Bakeries, renamed it. Ripplewood, which has close ties to Richard A. Gephardt, a former Democratic House majority leader and longtime ally of labor unions, is rarely viewed as a predatory private equity company - it originally bought Hostess as part of an effort to save distressed unionized companies.
"The company had plenty of time to figure out a new business model in terms of products, but it didn't, so it was convenient to blame labor for the company's failure," said John W. Budd, a professor of industrial relations at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. "Hostess's creditors weren't willing to make any more concessions, so if they didn't see a viable business model, that raises questions of why labor should be making more concessions."
An earlier version of this post misstated that name of Hostess's chief executive. He is Gregory F. Rayburn, not Gregory F. Raymond.

HIGHLIGHT: A response to Paul Krugman on economic security and social disintegration. 

 BODY:
My colleague Paul Krugman has written an interesting response to my Sunday column, which pushed back against "winning the future" triumphalism on the left by noting the emergent Democratic majority's roots in what I described as "social disintegration" and "economic fear." Krugman agrees with the second half of that description, but argues that the economic factors vastly oughtweigh the social ones:
The truth is that while single women and members of minority groups are more insecure at any given point of time than married whites, insecurity is on the rise for everyone, driven by changes in the economy. Our industrial structure is probably less stable than it was - you can't count on today's big corporations to survive, let alone retain their dominance, over the course of a working lifetime. And the traditional accoutrements of a good job - a defined-benefit pension plan, a good health-care plan - have been going away across the board.
 And nothing people can do in their personal lives or behavior can change this. Your church and your traditional marriage won't guarantee the value of your 401(k), or make insurance affordable on the individual market. 
So here's the question: isn't this exactly the kind of economy that should have a strong welfare state? Isn't it much better to have guaranteed health care and a basic pension from Social Security rather than simply hanker for the corporate safety net that no longer exists? Might one not even argue that a bit of basic economic security would make our dynamic economy work better, by reducing the fear factor?
I agree with quite a bit of this. The signal failure of Republican economic policy since the 1990s has been the absence of an agenda - apart from the temporary ascendance of "compassionate conservatism" - addressed to the turbulence that the Reagan revolution helped unleash, and the pressure on middle and working class wages created by the combination of global competition and surging health care costs. Amid such stresses, mere social conservatism is not enough: As Noah Millman of the American Conservative put it recently, "a marriage culture requires a material basis" that seems out of reach for too many Americans.
Where I part company with my colleague, though, is on the question of whether the existing American welfare state is basically sound and needs only to be expanded to meet these challenges, or whether we should be looking to prune and restructure in some arenas (entitlements, in particular) even as we try to address insecurity in others. I worry more than Krugman does (at least at the moment) about American economic growth in the shadow of our long-term deficits, more than he does about American competitiveness in a world where taxes and spending rise much higher than their post-1960s norm, and much more about some of the negative feedback loops that large welfare states tend to set in motion - where old-age spending weighs on working-age families, and falling birth rates undercut the basic demographic foundation of the system. Which is why I tend to think we should be trying to hit a kind of "small government egalitarian" sweet spot on these issues, instead of just letting the welfare state grow apace: We need to experiment policies that raise the returns to work for American families (whether that means a new child tax credit, an expanded earned income tax credit, a permanent payroll tax cut, further reforms to the health insurance marketplace, or something else entirely), but these policies need need to be accompanied by major entitlement reform and spending restraint in other areas as well.
I also disagree with my colleague that "nothing" about people's personal choices can mitigate the problems associated with economic insecurity. The fact that it was Rick Santorum saying it no doubt biases many liberals against the point, but his campaign trail riff about how much people improve their odds of staying out of poverty just by graduating from high school, taking full-time work and (above all) getting married before having kids has pretty solid data behind it. Yes, correlation isn't always causation; yes, there are lots of complicating variables at work in every individual life trajectory. But we have enough dataon the subject to say with some decisiveness that our age of economic instability hasn't severed the traditional link between the bourgeois virtues and the hope of becoming, well, bourgeois. (As Kevin Drum points out, this a point that nobody in the upper reaches of the American meritocracy seems to doubt where their own families are concerned.)
This is true even in Sweden, a country that Krugman invokes at the conclusion of his post as a model for how a sturdy-enough welfare state can more than compensate for the decline of the two-parent family. It's true that the Swedish rate of child poverty is much lower than ours even though their out-of-wedlock birth rate is higher, and the scope of their social spending clearly has something to do with this reality. (What's more, the design of that spending has some lessons for American conservatives, since the Swedes have combined generous family subsidies with their own version of entitlement reform.) However, three big caveats are in order. First, even though Sweden is more egalitarian than the United States, the link between child poverty and family structure is still very much present, and non-intact families produce worse outcomes for their offspring in Scandinavia as well. Second, Sweden's high out-of-wedlock birth rate notwithstanding, Swedish children are more likely than Americans to grow up with both parents in the household: The marriage rate may be lower, in other words, but Swedish families are more stable even when the parents are cohabitating rather than joined in matrimony.
This second caveat points, in turn, to the third and most important one, which is that Swedish society differs from American society so substantially as to make cross-country comparisons extremely difficult.
The Swedish experience does demonstrate that it's possible for a welfare-state society to survive the waning of religion and the decline of traditional marriage without sacrificing middle class prosperity. But this success is founded on a level of cultural homogeneity and an inheritance of social capital that simply isn't available in a polyglot republic-cum-empire like our own. Sweden has the population of North Carolina, no real linguistic or religious diversity, no experience of chattel slavery or mass immigration (and the children of recent immigrants in Sweden, incidentally, tend to have much higher poverty rates than the native-born), and a culture of Lutheran thrift and prudence that endures even though Lutheranism itself is on life support. America is and always has been a country of much greater diversity and wider cultural extremes, which is why we've always had to lean more heavily than smaller and more homogeneous societies on a wide array of mediating institutions - churches, families and private associations of all sorts - to foster assimilation, encourage upward mobility, and make the pursuit of happiness a possibility for people from wildly different walks of life. Even if the Scandinavian counter-example - in which a strong government compensates for a weakened social fabric - has some applicability here, it offers fewer lessons than many liberals like to think. The bonds that hold Swedish society together aren't just the creation of a well-funded welfare state, and they simply aren't available to, say, recent immigrants in Southern California or struggling blue-collar workers in the post-industrial Midwest.
All of this still leaves the question of how much public policy can really do about the fraying of those bonds. But I'll leave off here, and leave that subject that for another, post-Thanksgiving post.

HEADLINE: Upper-Income Consumers Report Less Spending

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Upper-income Americans may already be responding to the higher tax rates scheduled to kick in at the end of this year by curbing their spending, according to new data from Gallup. 

 BODY:
Upper-income Americans may already be responding to the higher tax rates scheduled to kick in at the end of this year by curbing their spending, according to new data from Gallup. 
Every day, Gallup polls Americans about how much money they spent "yesterday," not counting the purchase of a home or a motor vehicle or payment of normal household bills. The average self-reported amount spent by upper-income Americans (those earning more than $90,000) has been falling since the first few weeks of September through at least mid-November.
There was a spike around Halloween, but otherwise the trend has been downward.
"This implies that because upper-income consumers have, relatively speaking, more discretionary income than other Americans, they may decide to open up their pocketbooks for Black Friday, but then spend less as the holidays continue," writes Dennis Jacobe, Gallup's chief economist.
The numbers are not adjusted for seasonality, but the slide in upper-income spending does not seem to be explained by seasonal patterns. Here are the numbers for this time period last year and this year, shown side by side:
Taxes look likely to rise on all working Americans, assuming Congress allows the temporary payroll tax credit to expire at the end of this year as expected. Yet self-reported spending for the overall pool of consumers has shown a much smaller drop than that for just the top earners, particularly when you set aside the temporary spike around Halloween:
Americans in the very top few percentage points of the income distribution (taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes above $200,000 if they are single and $250,000 for couples) will probably see their taxes go up more, though. And while the pool of "upper-income" consumers whose spending is shown above includes a lot of people who are not in the very top of the income distribution, people in the highest third or so may still be wary about their tax liabilities next year.
"While many upper-income Americans may not know a lot about the fiscal cliff, it is hard for them to ignore at least one general postelection consensus: federal income taxes on those with higher incomes are going to increase in the year ahead," says Mr. Jacobe.
It's possible, I suppose, that Hurricane Sandy affected some of these spending numbers, since higher-income people are more concentrated in the Northeast. But it seems unlikely that enough people would have been affected by the storm for long enough to have skewed the numbers for multiple weeks.
For all consumers surveyed on spending habits, the pool of respondents is about 1,500 each day. For upper-income consumers, Gallup's average weekly sample size is about 500 respondents, Mr. Jacobe wrote in an e-mail.

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: In a Blackout, Solar Exceptions

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: While the recent blackouts were sobering, advances in battery technology are more driven by the issue of how the grid will absorb solar and wind power. 

 BODY:
As I reported this week in The Times, many homeowners with solar panels on their roofs found themselves without electricity along with their conventionally powered neighbors when Hurricane Sandy knocked out power along the coasts of New Jersey, Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island. But in Bayonne, N.J., a school with an unusual coupling of a solar array and a backup diesel generator found itself chugging along through the storm and its aftermath, allowing more than 50 residents to spend the night that Sandy hit on cots in a heated, dry and well-lighted community room.
At the heart of the system, designed and installed by Advanced Solar Products at the Midtown Community School, a designated evacuation center, is a special inverter with software that allows electricity from the panels to stop flowing out into the grid when it goes down.
It's a standard safety mechanism that protects line workers from electrocution during repairs. But in this case, the electricity goes to fuel critical systems in the building. The inverter keeps the emergency generator humming at a much lower level while the sun is shining and brings it back up to the necessary level when it is too cloudy or when night falls. 
The set-up has its own vulnerability in that if the generator runs out of diesel, the whole system shuts down, a weakness that the company is addressing with a new design that incorporates batteries as well.
"We already have residential-sized solar systems that can incorporate solar panels, batteries and generators, all in a single inverter, but that has not existed in commercial-sized systems until now," said Lyle Rawlings, chief executive of the company, based in Flemington, N.J..
That approach, one of many that various designers and companies are pursuing, is helping to light a path toward a more resilient energy future, one in which relationships between consumers and the grid are more dynamic. My own house, a tiny bungalow built in the 1910s near the ocean in Rockaway Beach, took a beating along with the rest of my neighborhood, where many of us were flooded and are still without power.
But we were lucky on my block to get a solar charging station in the community garden through Solar One, a nonprofit and educational group, and Power Rockaways Resilience, a group that is raising money to bring more mobile solar generation to the area.
I was curious to learn more about how people in the Northeast and elsewhere in the United States might be better prepared for disasters like Sandy -- or run-of-the-mill summer blackouts. I asked Mr. Rawlings to explain how new and developing technologies, especially batteries and inverters, are being put to use and how they might help ease growing strains on the grid going forward. Following are excerpts from our conversation, edited for brevity and clarity.
 Q. 
 What kind of solar system might homeowners want to install if they were clobbered by Sandy and are thinking, "I don't ever want that to happen to me again"? 
 A. 
If you're building PV [photovoltaics] for the first time, it's pretty simple: you choose an inverter that's capable of working with batteries and you're putting in the batteries. And you would take your critical loads and put them in a separate panel, an emergency panel. The bad news is that this is fairly costly -- anywhere from $7,000 to $12,000, and that's a very rough estimate. That's on top of the cost of a typical PV system, which is probably at this time maybe $22,000 to $30,000. It's quite an add-on.
But, on the other hand, that's going to operate reliably and silently during a storm. People aren't going to have to wait in line to fill up their gas cans and listen to a generator all night, and the cost of an automatic permanently installed generator is probably as much or more than that. It might cost a bit more to do it as a retrofit, but it should be close to the same.
 Q. 
 What are some of the newer technologies that are making this possible? 
 A. 
Battery technology is advancing, and the inverters that can work with those batteries are becoming commercially available. Interestingly enough, the main motivation that's bringing this to market is not emergency power, it's a different issue altogether. We've got to start thinking now of how our electric grid is going to handle higher penetration of renewable resources that are intermittent -- sun and wind.
You've got to ask what happens when the clouds roll over or when the winds stop blowing, and part of the answer to that is battery storage so that you don't get sudden changes that overwhelm the capability of controlling the grid and start to get the grid destabilizing and have blackouts or brownouts. Another important thing that the batteries can do is help control the frequency of the electric power.
So frequency regulation is a service that solar power systems can start to offer to the grid and actually get paid for it by PJM, which is the independent system operator in this region. So that economic incentive is getting people to install these battery-scale inverters.
 Q. 
 What has happened in the world of batteries that's allowing this suddenly to go forward?
 A. 
It's driven by that perception that solar is coming and wind is coming -- they're getting larger and larger -- and apart from renewables, the grid needs stabilization. We've seen the fragility of the grid in this storm, in the Northeast ice storm, and in Irene and in the snowstorm of Halloween last year. At the same time, the need for electric cars has been driving battery research, and so all these things have gone together and big companies have been pouring money into it.
 Q. 
 What do you think could be a kind of game changer for a place like New York, to make us a little more resilient?
 A. 
The incentives that exist in New Jersey for batteries connected to PJM -- those kind of frequency-regulating services -- those don't exist in N.Y.I.S.O., the grid operator in New York. So that should be instituted as quickly as possible. A smart thing to do would be for New York State to have some incentive for batteries because of this recognition that they're not just helping people with emergency power but they can do a lot of other things.
They'll be vital once we get to the point where the penetration of PV and wind in the grid are higher. The future of energy is going to be more complicated than in the past -- it's going to have wind, it's going to have solar, it's going to have demand-side management and energy efficiency, and the people trying to keep the lights on, the grid operators, are going to need to think differently and batteries are going to be a big part of that change.
 Q. 
 New Jersey seems to be pretty far ahead in laying the groundwork for this very complicated energy future that you're talking about.
 A. 
New Jersey is by a lot of measures the leading state in the nation in developing solar power: it's the fastest-growing solar market, in absolute size it's second only to California, and it's catching up. Just three or four years ago, California was about six to seven times the size of the Jersey market, but last year New Jersey was 60 percent the size of the California market, even though California is four and a half times the size of New Jersey population-wise.
And sometimes it's ahead in making the mistakes that other states can learn from. We're leading the way in terms of lessons learned, and what not to do as well.

HEADLINE: New Women's League and the Power of Three

BYLINE: JACK BELL


HIGHLIGHT: A new women's professional soccer league will launch in the United States in the spring. 

 BODY:
Plans were announced Wednesday for the launch of yet another Division 1 women's professional soccer league in the United States, the third such effort over the past decade or so. But this one has a twist. 
The as-yet unnamed eight-team circuit -- with teams in New Jersey, western New York, Boston, Washington, Kansas City, Chicago, Seattle and Portland -- will garner major support from the soccer associations in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The league is the successor to the Women's United Soccer Association and Women's Professional Soccer, both of which ceased operation after only three seasons.
"We had 11 groups that were vetted and we decided to start with eight teams," Sunil Gulati, the president of US Soccer, said during a telephone conference call. "The model that will be used will have US Soccer running the front office of the league and funding up to 24 national team players, three per team."
Canada, which will host the next Women's World Cup, in 2015, will pay the salaries of up to 16 of its national team players with the Mexican federation chipping in to foot the bill for up to 12 of its national team players.
Four of the teams, New Jersey, Western New York, Boston and Chicago, were part of W.P.S., which folded last year before the United States went to London and won its second consecutive Olympic gold medal. The Portland club will be operated by Merritt Paulson, who also operated the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer.
Most details remain to be worked out, like how many games the teams will play and in what stadiums, though officials said the new league will try to avoid expensive venues like Toyota Park in Bridgeview, Ill,, where the Chicago Red Stars played previously. Discussions are underway with several potential national sponsors and a television partner. Gulati added that Soccer United Marketing, the marketing arm of M.L.S., is likely to be involved, as it was with W.P.S.
"The real story is that we are trying to create an economic model that is sustainable," Gulati said. "We are subsidizing the private sector to make their investments smaller."
The season is scheduled to begin in March or April and run through September/October. The league will make provisions for FIFA's international dates leading up to the 2015 World Cup and also provide time for national team residency camps in all three countries.
At present, many of the top female players in the United States and Canada are signed to contracts with clubs in Europe. Some could come back and join the new league, though it it likely that some will wait and see if the league can be sustained.
After two previous failures, do you think there is a sustainable market for women's professional soccer in the United States?

 In Today's Times 

        
President Obama met with Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, an encounter that even Mr. Obama's aides called "tense." The president made no mention of America's history of carpet-bombing the country, and he stayed mum on the current Cambodian government's record of silencing opposition, Peter Baker reports.
 

        
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who backed the loser in America's presidential election, is now running for re-election himself. Helene Cooper and Mark Landler write that President Obama faces a decision on whether to to step in and help Mr. Netanyahu shore up his support at home.

        
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, did not mince wordson Tuesday as he urged Congress to act swiftly on a fiscal deal, Catherine Rampell reports. Citing several outside economic assessments of the coming tax increases and spending, he said that "a fiscal shock of that size would send the economy toppling back into recession."

        
Jennifer Steinhauer takes a look at the large, small and somewhat weird legacy of the 112th Congress. From "purse boys" to canine companions, she chronicles what are politely known as the personal eccentricities of departing members.

HEADLINE: The Turkey Chronicles

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Thanksgiving used to be the signal for the start of holiday shopping, but that was long ago and, of course, now the signal is Arbor Day. But Thanksgiving still retains an important role as the real end to the election season. This is it. No more talking about what happened in Ohio. Time to move forward. And, as a public service, I am willing to take questions.
What about the fiscal cliff? How can anybody be happy when we're falling off the fiscal cliff? We're all going to die!!!! 
Just stop that. Do you know where the members of Congress are now? Home having dinner with their families. Do you think they're refusing to eat anything because they're worried about the Bush tax cuts? No. Do you think they're sitting in the basement muttering about sequestration? No. Get with the program. No talking about the fiscal cliff during Thanksgiving.
Did President Obama pardon the turkey?
Yes, he did. It was named Cobbler. The previous Obama pardon winners were Courage, Apple and Liberty. Personally, I find it creepy to name a large, silly-looking bird after a cherished national virtue, or one of Gwyneth Paltrow's children.
Is it true that PETA is opposed to turkey pardoning?
The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says the pardon ''makes light of the mass slaughter of some 46 million gentle, intelligent birds.'' Which certainly does take some of the fun out of it. You have to admit. Cobbler didn't do anything to actually win a reprieve, except have a Facebook bio that alleged he was a fan of Carly Simon. Maybe we should see the whole ceremony as a commentary on the cruel randomness of fate.
Whoa! O.K. Never mind about the turkeys. What about the country? We just spent the last couple weeks listening to people like Bill O'Reilly say ''it's not a traditional America anymore.'' Is Thanksgiving an endangered tradition?
Are you kidding? Thanksgiving is our best holiday. Everybody likes it, and, except for eating, it has no rules. You never hear talking heads complain about the commercialization of Thanksgiving.
I'm not sure I want to quit talking about the election. I really liked watching the Republicans denouncing Mitt Romney, and going hehehe under my breath.
Time to let go. If you are a Republican, be thankful it's the end. If you were rooting for President Obama, give thanks that your particular demographic group was responsible for his win. We have excellent statistical evidence that it was Hispanics who made all the difference. And also blacks, gays, young people, unmarried people and women. If any of you had bolted, next year Mitt Romney would be pardoning the turkey.
If you are a Democratic older white married male, you can be thankful that your young, gay, female and minority friends like you so much that they are not holding your demography against you.
Is there anything about the election that's still unresolved?
Well, we never did find out who Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted for. ''The election is behind us, and we need to put politics behind us, too,'' the nation's most prominent undecided voter said in a statement as Congress left town. For Thanksgiving.
Is it too soon to start talking about 2016?
Not if you have no life whatsoever.
I have a lot of Republican relatives coming for Thanksgiving, and I think it would make them feel better.
Every Republican you ever heard of is thinking about a run in 2016. Rick Perry is thinking about it. If it weren't for his having died 82 years ago, William Howard Taft would be thinking about it.
The busiest bee seems to be Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. He just went to Iowa. And there's an interview in GQ in which he discusses leadership, says that Eminem is a better rapper than Pitbull, and that the question of whether the earth was created in seven days is ''one of the great mysteries.'' He also produced the first memorable quote of the 2016 campaign season. (''I think the age of the universe has zero to do with how our economy is going to grow.'')
But then later he clarified his remarks.
I would be happy to give thanks if he explained that he does believe in evolution.
You know that I'm going to tell you the clarification was that he really likes Pitbull's music.
By the way, what ever happened to Mitt Romney?
He has been sighted going to the gym, going to Disneyland and emerging from a screening of the latest ''Twilight'' movie, in which the heroine becomes a vampire and lives happily ever after. I can't tell you what that means, but he's probably not feeling all that thankful.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Claims Remain Elevated

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people seeking unemployment benefits remained elevated for a second week as Hurricane Sandy forced many people to seek temporary assistance.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday that first-time applications for jobless benefits fell by 41,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 410,000. That offset only part of the previous week's surge. 
Two weeks ago, the storm drove applications up by 90,000, to 451,000, an 18-month high. Nearly 44,000 people in New York and 31,000 in New Jersey applied for jobless benefits that week, according to the latest state data available. People in Pennsylvania and Connecticut also sought benefits because of the storm.
The four-week average of jobless claims, a less volatile measure, rose by 9,500, to 396,250.
Before the storm, weekly applications had fluctuated this year from 360,000 to 390,000. At the same time, employers added an average of nearly 157,000 jobs a month. That is barely enough to lower the unemployment rate, which was 7.9 percent in October.
The aftermath of the hurricane is also likely to slow job growth in November, economists said.
Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said that net job gains could fall to 25,000 this month from 171,000 in October. But employment should rebound after the impact of the hurricane passes. Rebuilding efforts after the storm could even create some jobs.
''If there is any good news in this extremely tragic event, it is that the longer-term impacts on the labor market in particular and the economy in general are negligible,'' he said.
There are some signs that the job market is improving. Hiring picked up in October and was stronger than first estimated in August and September, the Labor Department said this month. The economy gained an average of 174,000 jobs a month in the July-to-September quarter. That is up from 67,000 a month in April through June.
The number of people receiving unemployment benefits increased by about 244,000, to 5.2 million, in the week that ended Nov. 3, the latest data available. That is up from fewer than five million the previous week.
Still, consumers are optimistic the unemployment rate will drop over the next 12 months, raising their confidence to the highest level in five years.
The University of Michigan said Wednesday that its consumer sentiment index ticked up to 82.7 this month from 82.6 in October. The index has increased 19 percentage points in the last year.
Optimism about the job market is high. Of those surveyed, 30 percent expect the unemployment rate will fall over the next 12 months. That matches October's percentage and is the highest since 1984.
Separately, the Conference Board said on Wednesday that its index of leading indicators increased 0.2 percent in October after a 0.5 percent gain in September. The slight gain suggests growth could remain weak. The index is intended to anticipate economic conditions three to six months out.

HEADLINE: Court Allows Liquidation Of Hostess

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved plans for Hostess Brands to wind down its operations, but there is little doubt that its best-known brand, Twinkies, will live on.
The company, whose corporate ancestors go back 82 years, said it would put Twinkies on the auction block, along with its other famous brands, including Ho Hos, Sno Balls, Ring Dings and Wonder Bread.
In granting the motion by Hostess, Judge Robert D. Drain of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York said it was important to have a quick and orderly shutdown of the company to prevent the deterioration of its factories and assets.
The company's chief executive, Gregory F. Rayburn, testified in court that he needed to lay off 15,000 of his 18,500 employees on Wednesday afternoon so that they could begin applying for unemployment benefits as soon as possible. He said such speed was necessary for maximizing the remaining value of the company. 
"From this point forward, I need two things to happen," Mr. Rayburn told the judge. "I need to maximize the value of the estate, and I need to do the best thing for the employees."
Wednesday's hearing came after a last-ditch mediation session on Tuesday between Hostess and its bakery workers union. After several hours of talks, the mediation efforts collapsed.
Hostess announced its intention to liquidate last Friday, and since then the company has received expressions of interest for its bakery brands from a wide range of potential buyers. Without naming names, an investment banker for Hostess, Joshua S. Scherer of Perella Weinberg Partners, said in court on Wednesday that they included regional bakeries, national competitors and retail customers along the lines of Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger.
Mr. Scherer added that his firm had plans to contact around 145 financial firms, including private equity shops and liquidators, to gauge their interest.
Investment concerns like Sun Capital Partners and C. Dean Metropoulos & Company, the owner of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, have already said that they are interested in buying some or all of Hostess's remains. Sun Capital has said that it would like to buy all of Hostess, not just its brands, hoping to preserve the company and improve its often-tense relations with its unions.
Mr. Scherer said that he expected asset sales to reap "significant values," perhaps more than $1 billion. Hostess had revenue of $2.5 billion in fiscal 2012, and a net loss of $1.1 billion.
Its famous brands have been sold and traded for decades among companies, including I.T.T., Ralston Purina and Continental Baking.
"These products will surely live on in one form or the other - because these brands are about as indestructible as Hostess's baked goods are," said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for executive programs at the Yale School of Management.
Hostess was unable to resuscitate itself during this bankruptcy, its second in less than a decade. When it filed for bankruptcy last January, it had nearly $1 billion in debt as well as labor costs and work rules that it insisted were unsustainable.
According to Mr. Raymond, what sent the company into bankruptcy was both the refusal of one of its largest unions, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, to accept far-reaching concessions and a strike that the union began on Nov. 9, crippling two-thirds of the company's 33 bakeries.
The bakery workers union, with 5,600 workers at Hostess, repeatedly said that it saw no reason to grant a new round of givebacks - after having granted major concessions in the previous bankruptcy of Hostess - because it was convinced that Hostess was heading toward liquidation, with or without concessions. That union and Hostess's other major union, the Teamsters, repeatedly asserted that the company was mismanaged, having had six different chief executives since 2002. The unions maintained that Hostess's top management had done little to modernize the company's aging bakeries or its sugary product offerings - in an era when the nation has grown increasingly health conscious.
After filing for bankruptcy protection in January, Hostess demanded lower-cost contracts from the Teamsters, whose workers at Hostess average about $20 an hour, and the bakery workers, who average about $16. To help the company survive, the Teamsters, with 6,700 members at Hostess, most of them drivers, reluctantly agreed to a contract with numerous concessions. They include new work rules, an immediate 8 percent pay cut, a 17 percent reduction in Hostess's contribution toward health coverage and a suspension of its pension payments until 2015. In return, the company agreed to give its unions two of the nine seats on its board and a 25 percent stake in the company.
But the bakery workers' union resisted a similar deal, convinced it would drive down wages in the industry while in no way guaranteeing Hostess's survival. That union went on strike rather than accept that offer, hoping the company would bend.
A week after the strike began, Mr. Rayburn said he would liquidate the company.
The looming liquidation of Hostess has been a topic of debate, with many on one side criticizing greedy, stubborn labor unions and many on the other blaming what the bakery workers' president has called "vulture capitalists." The company entered its first bankruptcy in 2004 with $450 million in debt, and exited five years later with even more debt - $670 million.
"The private equity owners put this thing in such deep debt and asked for such deep concessions that it put the unions in a difficult situation," said Thomas A. Kochan, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "The unions weren't sure whether these concessions would be enough to salvage the company."
Hostess Brands has corporate roots going back to 1930, but the company has had that name only since 2009, when Ripplewood Holdings, the private equity firm that took control of Interstate Bakeries, renamed it. Ripplewood, which has close ties to Richard A. Gephardt, a former Democratic House majority leader and longtime ally of labor unions, is rarely viewed as a predatory private equity company - it originally bought Hostess as part of an effort to save distressed unionized companies.
"The company had plenty of time to figure out a new business model in terms of products, but it didn't, so it was convenient to blame labor for the company's failure," said John W. Budd, a professor of industrial relations at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. "Hostess's creditors weren't willing to make any more concessions, so if they didn't see a viable business model, that raises questions of why labor should be making more concessions."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 2 Bruising Sports Tantalize Jets' Owner: Football and Politics

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
The duality of Woody Johnson's life over the last two years was on full display two weeks ago, on a crisp Tuesday night in Boston. As election results started pouring in at Mitt Romney's party at the city's convention center, Johnson sat sending e-mail after e-mail to Jets executives in New Jersey.
It was a telling moment for Johnson, who has balanced these twin pursuits -- owning one of the N.F.L.'s more valuable franchises and serving as a critical member of the Romney campaign's fund-raising team -- while edging closer into public view, continuing a transformation from reclusive billionaire. 
But that moment also came on a night of great disappointment. For years, the Jets could not escape the considerable shadow of the Giants, an existence that has changed in the Rex Ryan era through a combination of personality and on-field success. The Jets remain a formidable source of attention, but for different reasons.
Tim Tebow. An eroded talent base. Another round of anonymous sniping.
Johnson said he would rather Romney move into the White House than the Jets savor a winning season. Barack Obama secured a second term as president, and the Jets are still struggling, at 4-9 over their last 13 games and 4-6 this season, toiling on the periphery of the playoff picture.
On Thursday night, while Americans sit in front of the television after their annual gorging, Johnson's team will face its fiercest rival, the New England Patriots, in a prime-time game that he requested. It will be another very public reckoning for something that Johnson holds dear -- a high-profile moment in a year that has been filled with them.
''What I know is that Woody has three passions: curing lupus, having the Jets win a Super Bowl and his commitment to the Romney campaign,'' said Kenneth Farber, the president of the Alliance for Lupus Research, of which Johnson is chairman of the board, and a friend of his for nearly 30 years. Johnson's daughter Jaime has lupus.
''He wants success for all of them, and he can be impatient in that sense,'' Farber said. ''Woody is not a lethargic guy, you know.''
Whenever possible, Johnson would front-load his schedule so that he spent the early part of the week involved in his political endeavors and the latter part focused on his team, with attending practice a priority. He devoted countless hours to supporting Romney, following him to Israel and Wyoming and Florida, where at the Republican National Convention in August he told CNBC that ''you can never have too much Tebow.''
Inevitably, football intersected with politics on the campaign trail -- sometimes by happenstance, as when donors who were fans of the Giants or the Patriots would introduce themselves as such, and other times by design. One of the few finance people deployed to speak on behalf of the campaign, Johnson appeared regularly on cable news programs, mixing thoughts on the economy with, when asked, views of his team.
During the height of fund-raising season, in April, Johnson told Fox Business Network that the decision to acquire Tebow was a collaborative one. But, he added jokingly, if Tebow ''turns out to be a great player, I'll take full accountability for that.''
The Jets' sporadic use of Tebow has fueled the perception that the Jets acquired him not only to diversify their offense (which he has yet to do), but also to increase sales of personal seat licenses and to restore the spotlight on the team after a tumultuous off-season and the Giants' championship. Johnson condemned that notion last week, telling reporters that it was ''phony'' and that his job ''one, two and three is to win games -- that's why I got into football.''
Johnson spoke to reporters that afternoon for the first time since the beginning of what he called a ''miserable experience'' of a season, and he seemed as outwardly upset -- with that perception, with the team's performance -- as he has in some time. Those who have worked closely with Johnson characterize him as proactive and optimistic, someone who would rather plan for success than dwell on failures. He does not sit idly, they say. He demands response. He solicits solutions. He expects results.
Searching for those results, Johnson summoned General Manager Mike Tannenbaum; the team's president, Neil Glat; and Coach Rex Ryan, as well as Ryan's three coordinators, for a meeting Nov. 13, two days after the Jets absorbed a third consecutive defeat -- and a second straight by 21 points. Glat would not elaborate on the subject matter, but he said the meeting was ''incredibly productive and constructive.''
''He's expressed disappointment with the team's record so far this season, but he's handled it in a 'here's where we are -- now where do we go from here; how do we better?' kind of way,'' Glat said. ''Whether it's ups and downs in business or on the football field, I've never seen him despondent. The focus has always been on moving forward.''
Associates of Johnson say that he is not prone to emotional outbursts. When the Jets are playing well, he cheers and offers the occasional high-five. When they are not -- or he is disappointed for other reasons -- he tends to get quiet, reflective. Johnson's experience dealing with the turbulent nature of presidential campaigns, with barrages of polls often stimulating hope and despair on the same day, has steeled him for the tumult of a football season -- and, perhaps, vice versa.
When it became apparent on election night that Romney would lose -- but less clear that a concession speech was imminent -- Johnson retired to his room at the Westin. He was exhausted and ready for bed, but then his cellphone rang. On the other line was Chris Applegate, a political adviser to Johnson, who had just encountered a few of Romney's sons by an elevator bank. They said they wanted to see Johnson.
After he put his suit back on, Johnson joined Romney's family backstage. He gave Romney a hug before leaving, this time for good.
The next morning, Johnson flew back to New York, back to the Jets.

HEADLINE: Jordan Protesters Dream of Shift to King's Brother

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
AMMAN, Jordan -- King Abdullah II was never his father's favorite.
In a letter from his deathbed, the king's father, King Hussein, signaled a preference for Hamzah, the eldest son of the fourth and final queen, who the king wrote had been ''envied since childhood because he was close to me.'' And though Hamzah was still in school, the king insisted that he be named crown prince in line to succeed Abdullah, Hamzah's eldest half brother -- though the new king later rescinded that title.
Now, 13 years after King Hussein's death and King Abdullah's ascension, the fantasy of a handover to Hamzah, 32, has captured the imagination of a resurgent protest movement that poses the biggest threat in decades to the stability of Jordan, a pivotal American ally. This dream of a transition to a new king within the same dynasty, critics say, is an apt reflection of the ambiguous character of the protests, animated by the democratic spirit of the Arab Spring uprisings but also by nostalgia.
''There is a popular outcry for Hamzah,'' said an organizer in the two-year-old secular opposition network Hirak, which began raising demands for political reform and local development after the start of the Arab Spring revolts. (Its name comes from the Arabic word for movement.) 
Speaking on the condition of anonymity -- promoting Prince Hamzah has landed at least one journalist in jail, and on Sunday 89 people were arrested and charged with fomenting violent protests -- the organizer said Hirak activists were planning to hold up pictures of Hamzah and the other princes at protests to suggest intrafamily change.
The political tremors are disconcerting for American policy makers because of the role Jordan has played as a dependable ally and a stabilizing buffer zone in a volatile region. Jordan is the only Arab country besides Egypt to sign a peace treaty with Israel, and, in contrast to Egypt, the Islamist party in Jordan that has made up the principal political opposition has staunchly opposed the pact. Also, Jordan sits between Iraq and Syria, and it has absorbed vast numbers of refugees, including hundreds of thousands fleeing the Syrian strife.
Supporters of King Abdullah argue that the attention paid to Prince Hamzah is evidence that, in contrast to the other Arab Spring movements, the protests here are essentially conservative. The wave of demonstrations that broke out last week was set off not by any expressed yearning for freedom, they say, but by the end of fuel subsidies that threatened to bankrupt the country. His loyalists also say that at its base the protest movement is driven by opposition to King Abdullah's program of economic liberalization and privatization, a sharp break with King Hussein.
Those initiatives have been a threat to members of the old clans based on the East Bank of the Jordan River who were King Hussein's core supporters, who made up the backbone of his security services and who benefited the most from public-sector jobs and patronage. The same clans and towns are now the wellspring of Hirak.
The opposition movement has directed special hatred toward King Abdullah's glamorous Palestinian wife, Queen Rania, whose influence the organizers have cited as one of their top complaints. Tensions between East Bank natives and Palestinian immigrants, who make up about half of Jordan's population, are the major fissure in Jordanian politics. And while East Bank natives have dominated the public sector, Palestinians have flourished in the private sector and stand to gain from liberalization.
The king views Hirak as advocating ''the status quo,'' one diplomat who has talked to him said.
But many of the demonstrators who turned out for four days of protests in Amman and other cities last week said that economic grievances were beginning to translate into new demands for democratic political change, toward the adoption of a constitutional monarchy like Britain's.
Although the fuel price increases were the catalyst, the demonstrations included the first explicit calls for the king's ouster, as protesters took up the signature Arab Spring chant about ''the fall of the regime,'' even though that can be a capital offense here. Indeed, a wide range of Jordanians, not just demonstrators, said the kingdom's censorship and political repression undercut the king's pledges that, after years of rigged elections and false promises, he was about to usher in democratic change.
The demonstrations also drew a broad cross-section of young people and professionals, just as the first riots of the Arab Spring did in Tunisia and Egypt almost two years ago.
''When the people choose their government, they will accept the government's decisions -- even a price hike -- because then it is a decision of the people, too,'' said Obada al-Ali, 22, a medical student at a rally in Irbid, Jordan's second-largest city. ''It is not just a matter of money. It is about the will of the people.''
King Abdullah is not the only heir to political power in the Arab world whose embrace of privatization and economic liberalization shook up an old elite and drew allegations of corruption. Much the same happened in Egypt, with Gamal Mubarak, a son of former President Hosni Mubarak; in Libya, with Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi; and in Syria, with President Bashar al-Assad, a son of Hafez al-Assad, a former president.
Demonstrators in Amman and other places around Jordan blamed official corruption for the country's poverty, and they pinned the corruption on a lack of accountability for King Abdullah. At rallies, protesters held hands to perform what they called ''the corruption dance,'' chanting that King Abdullah was Ali Baba, the legendary thief.
''The corruption is woven into the fabric, and everything is connected to it, even the unemployment,'' said Gassem Gharaibeh, 40, a Hirak activist in Irbid.
But the protesters also had more specific complaints about King Abdullah's authenticity. Educated abroad while his father groomed his brother for the throne, King Abdullah is sometimes derided for being more fluent in English than in Arabic. ''We are speaking Arabic, clear Arabic, leave!'' demonstrators chanted in Amman.
They accuse Queen Rania of building a lifestyle of extreme luxury while her family grows rich on its connections. Many Jordanians still talk of the 40th birthday party she held for herself two years ago in the stunning desert canyon of Wadi Rum, with many of her 600 guests flown in from around the world, the pink granite walls lighted with the number 40 like a giant birthday cake, and drinking water hauled in by the truckload.
''Rania and Abdullah stole Jordan!'' goes another popular chant.
But there is still much love for King Hussein, and many appear to extend that nostalgic glow to Prince Hamzah. East Bank Jordanians say that Prince Hamzah was often sent to move among them, to polish his Arabic and to work on the common touch that his father had.
''Hamzah would be better, because King Hussein trained him to be a king,'' said Sahel Majali, 54, a businessman in traditional dress sitting on a stoop with a grandson in Amman. ''King Abdullah should apologize to the Jordanian people, because his bad decisions have gotten us into this terrible place.''
Faten Talafha, who went to gawk at the protest on Friday in Amman, echoed the sentiment. ''In the days of King Hussein, we were a proud people,'' she said, and as for Prince Hamzah, ''I love him.''
Prince Hamzah has stayed silent, far from the public eye. But three organizers with Hirak said its 70-member steering committee, which meets in the headquarters of an Amman labor union, was leaning toward an embrace of Prince Hamzah, too.
''We used to want just to change the current regime under King Abdullah,'' the Hirak organizer said. ''But after two years, with no reform, with no action against the corruption, and with fuel prices going up, you begin to see that this guy is in a coma and does not want to connect.''
Added another organizer, ''This king can't reform himself, so let him bring in his brother.''

HEADLINE: A Failed Experiment

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
In upper-middle-class suburbs on the East Coast, the newest must-have isn't a $7,500 Sub-Zero refrigerator. It's a standby generator that automatically flips on backup power to an entire house when the electrical grid goes out.
In part, that's a legacy of Hurricane Sandy. Such a system can cost well over $10,000, but many families are fed up with losing power again and again. 
(A month ago, I would have written more snarkily about residential generators. But then we lost power for 12 days after Sandy -- and that was our third extended power outage in four years. Now I'm feeling less snarky than jealous!)
More broadly, the lust for generators is a reflection of our antiquated electrical grid and failure to address climate change. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave our grid, prone to bottlenecks and blackouts, a grade of D+ in 2009.
So Generac, a Wisconsin company that dominates the generator market, says it is running three shifts to meet surging demand. About 3 percent of stand-alone homes worth more than $100,000 in the country now have standby generators installed.
''Demand for generators has been overwhelming, and we are increasing our production levels,'' Art Aiello, a spokesman for Generac, told me.
That's how things often work in America. Half-a-century of tax cuts focused on the wealthiest Americans leave us with third-rate public services, leading the wealthy to develop inefficient private workarounds.
It's manifestly silly (and highly polluting) for every fine home to have a generator. It would make more sense to invest those resources in the electrical grid so that it wouldn't fail in the first place.
But our political system is dysfunctional: in addressing income inequality, in confronting climate change and in maintaining national infrastructure.
The National Climatic Data Center has just reported that October was the 332nd month in a row of above-average global temperatures. As the environmental Web site Grist reported, that means that nobody younger than 27 has lived for a single month with colder-than-average global temperatures, yet climate change wasn't even much of an issue in the 2012 campaign. Likewise, the World Economic Forum ranks American infrastructure 25th in the world, down from 8th in 2003-4, yet infrastructure is barely mentioned by politicians.
So time and again, we see the decline of public services accompanied by the rise of private workarounds for the wealthy.
Is crime a problem? Well, rather than pay for better policing, move to a gated community with private security guards!
Are public schools failing? Well, superb private schools have spaces for a mere $40,000 per child per year.
Public libraries closing branches and cutting hours? Well, buy your own books and magazines!
Are public parks -- even our awesome national parks, dubbed ''America's best idea'' and the quintessential ''public good'' -- suffering from budget cuts? Don't whine. Just buy a weekend home in the country!
Public playgrounds and tennis courts decrepit? Never mind -- just join a private tennis club!
I'm used to seeing this mind-set in developing countries like Chad or Pakistan, where the feudal rich make do behind high walls topped with shards of glass; increasingly, I see it in our country. The disregard for public goods was epitomized by Mitt Romney's call to end financing of public broadcasting.
A wealthy friend of mine notes that we all pay for poverty in the end. The upfront way is to finance early childhood education for at-risk kids. The back-end way is to pay for prisons and private security guards. In cities with high economic inequality, such as New York and Los Angeles, more than 1 percent of all employees work as private security guards, according to census data.
This question of public goods hovers in the backdrop as we confront the ''fiscal cliff'' and seek to reach a deal based on a mix of higher revenues and reduced benefits. It's true that we have a problem with rising entitlement spending, especially in health care. But I also wonder if we've reached the end of a failed half-century experiment in ever-lower tax rates for the wealthy.
Since the 1950s, the top federal income tax rate has fallen from 90 percent or more to 35 percent. Capital gains tax rates have been cut by more than half since the late 1970s. Financial tycoons now often pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries.
All this has coincided with the decline of some public services and the emergence of staggering levels of inequality (granted, other factors are also at work) such that the top 1 percent of Americans now have greater collective net worth than the entire bottom 90 percent.
Not even the hum of the most powerful private generator can disguise the failure of that long experiment.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Rises For 4th Day, A Light One

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks finished modestly higher on Wednesday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up for a fourth consecutive session, although volume was one of the year's lowest on the day ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
About 4.76 billion shares were traded, as compared with the year-to-date daily average volume of 6.5 billion shares.
Investors welcomed news that a cease-fire was declared to end the flare-up in violence between Israel and Hamas, though the lack of a deal to release emergency aid for Greece limited the market's advance.
Investors also remained anxious about the mandatory tax increases and spending cuts that would go into effect in the new year if a deal was not reached to prevent it. Policy makers are not expected to get back to negotiations until after Thanksgiving.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 48.38 points, or 0.38 percent, to end at 12,836.89. The S.& P. 500-stock index added 3.22 points, or 0.23 percent, to finish at 1,391.03. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.87 points, or 0.34 percent, to close at 2,926.55.
Fears that the tax and spending discussions in Washington could be drawn out or yield no resolution have been at the forefront of investors' minds in recent weeks. Combined with concerns about the euro zone's continued debt problems, the worries had driven a sell-off that has taken more than 5 percent off the S.& P. 500 since Election Day in early November.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 4/32, to 99 16/32, and the yield rose to 1.68 percent from 1.67 percent late Tuesday.
St. Jude Medical shares tumbled 12.2 percent to $31.37 after an inspection report from health regulators raised new safety concerns about one of the company's leads that are used with implantable defibrillators, analysts said.
A modest gain in International Business Machines helped the Dow outperform the other indexes. I.B.M. rose 0.6 percent to $190.29.
Another Dow component, Hewlett-Packard, climbed 2 percent to close on Wednesday at $11.94, recouping a small slice of Tuesday's loss, when the stock slid to a 10-year low after the computer and printer maker reported a $5 billion charge related to what it called accounting improprieties at Autonomy, a British software company that H.P. bought last year.
At least two brokerage firms have cut their ratings on H.P.'s stock, while analysts at several firms lowered their price targets.
The market did not derive much direction from the day's economic data, with initial jobless claims falling last week, as expected.
On Thursday, the stock markets in the United States will be closed for Thanksgiving, and on Friday, they will close at 1 p.m.

HEADLINE: N.H.L. Rejects Union Offer

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
The N.H.L. on Wednesday rejected the latest players union proposal despite significant concessions from the union 67 days into the lockout.
''We're still far apart, but hopefully there's some momentum so we can bring this to a conclusion,'' Commissioner Gary Bettman said. ''There was some movement in our direction, and it was appreciated.'' 
Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, said the league responded to the offer with ''nothing on significant economic issues'' and ''no reciprocity'' in the talks at the N.H.L. office in Manhattan.
''The players have done an awful lot here,'' Fehr said. ''Still, it doesn't appear to be enough.''
Winnipeg defenseman Ron Hainsey, who has been present at nearly every negotiating session, described the league as being less categorical in its rejection of the union's proposal than it has been in past sessions, particularly on Oct. 18, when Bettman took 15 minutes to turn down three union offers.
''I would not say it was a blanket no,'' Hainsey said. ''They responded to our proposal, but there was no meaningful move in our direction in anything that we would consider a major issue.''
No further talks were scheduled, but Bettman said he hoped to hear from the union on Friday.
With no deal imminent, the first half of the December schedule is expected to be canceled as early as Friday. Thus far, the league has canceled 327 games.
The next cancellation is also expected to include the Jan. 27 All-Star Game, scheduled for Jan. 27 in Columbus, Ohio. The financially ailing Blue Jackets had been counting on the All-Star weekend to fill their coffers, but those hopes may soon be dashed.
The union offered to accept 50 percent of revenue in the first year of a new deal rather than a guaranteed amount. It was the first time the union agreed to take a percentage of revenue.
The union also agreed to a league demand to curb front-loaded contracts.
Fehr characterized the union offer as leaving the sides just $182 million apart over five years. But the league rejected that notion, as it has previous union assertions that the two sides were close.
''Today isn't the first time the union has come out of a session and talked about how wonderful their offer is or how close we were, when in fact the reality was they were misleading you,'' Bettman said.
He also criticized the union for using ''spin,'' ''gamesmanship'' and ''stalling'' during the negotiations.
Bettman estimated the lockout was costing the league and its players $18 million to $20 million a day in lost revenue.
''We made what was our best offer in order to save an 82-game season,'' Bettman said, referring to a league proposal earlier this month. ''That offer was summarily rejected. But to expect our best economic proposal as damage continues to increase isn't particularly realistic.
''We've given what we have to give,'' Bettman added. ''It was our best offer.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Stay Steady Despite Mideast Conflict

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- American drivers filling their tanks for the Thanksgiving weekend can forget the impact of the Middle East on oil prices for a day or two.
Global oil prices went up and down Wednesday as diplomatic efforts to end the turmoil in Israel and the Gaza Strip faltered and then appeared to succeed. But after eight days of violence, most benchmark prices are little changed from where they began.
A rise in oil and gasoline prices during a Middle East crisis would be no surprise, and there is no telling how long the cease-fire will last. But oil experts say there is little chance of a big price spike since Israel and Gaza are not oil-producing areas and global supplies are currently plentiful. 
In addition, while many oil-producing nations in the Middle East and elsewhere are pumping oil at unusually high rates, demand for petroleum products in much of the world has weakened because of the global economic slowdown.
''The global market is well supplied,'' said Chakib Khelil, a former Algerian energy minister who was also president of OPEC. ''The stocks are pretty good, and the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia are sustaining supplies while the weak economic situation in Europe is softening demand.''
Many analysts say the global Brent crude oil benchmark price, currently around $111 a barrel, would be $20 to $30 lower if it were not for the persistent instability in the Middle East and North Africa, particularly the tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear energy policies.
Crude prices have fluctuated since tensions between Hamas and Israel spurred an exchange of rocket fire and bombs over the last week, as some traders feared that a full-fledged war might bring Iran and other regional powers into the conflict.
Prices eased on Tuesday by nearly 2 percent as negotiations for a cease-fire appeared to gain traction, but then rebounded about 1 percent after a bus bombing in Tel Aviv on Wednesday slowed progress. As reports surfaced that a cease-fire was again at hand, crude prices settled back down and then rose slightly.
But drivers in the United States have been minimally affected by the crisis, in part because a boom in oil drilling in North Dakota and Texas has decreased the country's dependence on foreign oil.
The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States on Wednesday was $3.43, nearly 2 cents lower than a week ago and 24 cents lower than a month ago.
Compared with a year ago, though, the price was up 8 cents, and the highest on record for Thanksgiving. That is mostly because of the effects of Hurricane Sandy, which interrupted supplies in the New York metropolitan area and on much of the East Coast. In many other states, drivers are paying less for gasoline than they were a year ago.
According to the Oil Price Information Service and AAA, gasoline prices in New Jersey are roughly 30 cents above last year's levels, while drivers in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are paying over 20 cents more. Oil analysts say those prices should begin to ease in the next two weeks as regional refineries and oil terminals that suffered flooding and power failures gradually return to normal operations.
With the exception of temporary, localized problems, oil experts say the country is well supplied with oil and gasoline, despite an Energy Department report on Wednesday showing that crude oil and motor gasoline inventories declined last week.
''Nationally, we have ample gasoline supplies, given where demand is,'' said Anthony Rouse, chief economist at Phillips 66, the global refinery giant.
Mr. Rouse said he did not think the Gaza crisis would affect domestic petroleum supplies or prices in any substantial way. ''Right now, this looks relatively self-contained in nations that are not really oil-producing areas,'' he said, adding that even if Iran became more deeply involved, ''the market is already factoring in lower Iranian production because of the sanctions.''
Iran is exporting just over a million barrels a day, down from three million in the summer of 2011 because of sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe. Even so, production by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has increased over the last year, with Iraq's output up by 500,000 barrels a day and Libya recovering more than 1.5 million barrels a day lost during its civil war last year. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are also producing more.
Countries outside of OPEC are also producing slightly more than a year ago, mainly because of increased output from the United States and Canada.
Demand for liquid fuels is down by 1.5 percent in the United States this year, according to the Energy Department, because of the slow economic recovery and a gradual improvement in the efficiency of cars. Demand is falling even faster in Europe, and demand in the developing world is increasing more slowly.
Nevertheless, energy experts warn that a jump in oil prices is possible in the year ahead because so much of the world's supplies come from politically unstable nations. Pipeline sabotage has caused production delays in Nigeria in recent months. Libyan militias independent of government control can threaten oil production, though so far they have mostly left the country's oil fields and refineries alone. Sectarian violence is a threat to Iraq's growing oil industry.
Then there is the possibility that Israel or the United States might attack Iran to stop it from attaining nuclear weapons. Iran has repeatedly threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway through which nearly one-fifth of the world's oil is shipped.
''The Middle East will always be hanging over us,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which is partly financed by the oil industry.

HEADLINE: Appreciating The Art Of a Deal

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
REALLY, the prices were too high. At least in this humble shopper's opinion. And while haggling was encouraged, even the most experienced hondlers accrued, on average, at most a $2 savings.
But bargains weren't the point at the ''Meta-Monumental Garage Sale,'' which opened Saturday on the second-floor atrium of the Museum of Modern Art. It was the latest iteration of a performance piece that the artist Martha Rosler, 69, has been enacting for more than four decades, selling items donated by friends, family, colleagues and fans, as well as her own castoffs (including, rather memorably in the early '70s, used diaphragms and her son's baby shoes).
The aim was to create, as a news release for the event promised, ''a lively space for exchange, not only for consumer goods but also for real and fictive narratives, ideas and interactions with the artist.''
Ms. Rosler, a no-nonsense woman with short gray hair and a taste for Yiddish, has long been interested in feminism and capitalism, chewing over these subjects in videos, photographs and written work. During the Vietnam War, Ms. Rosler inserted the war's most chilling images into pages torn from ''House Beautiful'' magazine. 
She can declaim with the best of them about high modernism, postmodernism and new institutionalism. But last Saturday, Ms. Rosler was all pragmatism, as befits a garage sale major-domo. She was both harried and focused, just as you would be if you had collected, priced and displayed more than 14,000 items, including a 1981 Mercedes diesel station wagon, sans engine ($4,000); a porcelain sink ($70); rows of chairs, like '70s-era Thonet knockoffs (average price, $60); much holiday bric-a-brac, like plastic Christmas table ornaments from the 1960s in their original packaging ($7); girlie magazines from the 1950s and 1960s (not yet priced); and kitchen accessories (whisks, sieves and dish racks, $4 to $2). In short, it was the same familiar stew of tchotchkes, curiosities and furniture you would find at any yard sale, although the process of assembling it was amplified by the vicissitudes of Hurricane Sandy.
The crowd was familiar, too, a polite line of looky-loos, bargain hunters and accidental tourists who funneled into the atrium in groups of 200. There were even early birds, like John Firestone, a Manhattan lawyer and MoMA member, who had been waiting since just after 10 a.m. and scored the first spot on line. (The show/sale is open from noon to 5 p.m. -- except Friday, when it closes at 7:30, and Tuesday, when the museum is closed -- until Nov. 30)
Mr. Firestone, 54, said he was a collector of this sort of cultural experience, having logged in nine hours (though not in one sitting) of ''The Clock'' when it played at Lincoln Center last summer, among other events. Second place in line went to four high school friends from Maplewood, N.J., including Ava Milanese, 14, who had her eye on a sweatshirt bedazzled with a Christmas wreath that was on display high up the atrium's wall, for which, she said, she was willing to pay as much as $50.
''If you buy a piece of Martha Rosler-curated stuff, do you use it?'' Mr. Firestone asked. ''Or is it somehow imbued with a presence, so it becomes an art object?'' In the manner of, he went on to say, the fly swatter he bought at Maira Kalman's show last year at the Jewish Museum, which featured Ms. Kalman's drawings of everyday things, as well as tables and shelves displaying actual everyday things.
As it turned out, the Christmas sweatshirt was $20, which Ms. Milanese happily paid, even though Ms. Rosler cautioned: ''It's got coffee stains on the elbows. It's slightly pilled, too. That's why it's priced so low.''
Also, Ms. Milanese was told she wouldn't be able to pick up her purchase until the last day of the show, because it was part of a wall display. But most of the items were cash-and-carry.
Lilly Gilman, 34, who described herself as ''in school-slash-unemployed-slash-used-to-be-an-artist,'' was trying on a snap-button denim shirt, a ringer for the one her husband, Will Gilman, 32, was wearing.
''I'm a compulsive buyer of Western denim shirts with snaps,'' Ms. Gilman said, adding that she had bought five this year, average price $15, from eBay and other sources.
This denim shirt was missing a price tag. Would she pay $20? Mr. Gilman answered: ''That would be high, except it has added value.''
A white wedding photo album gave some shoppers pause. Who would throw out a wedding album? ''Probably divorced,'' said one woman, an insurance consultant. ''After my sister got divorced, she burned her wedding album in the Chiminea.''
Jean Adelhardt, a relative, appeared suddenly, gazing fondly at the album's black-and-white photographs. ''They are dead,'' she said. ''Don't feel bad, I scanned all the images. She's my aunt. It's a celebration of her. She was an artist. Now she's in MoMA!''
A young man holding a globe approached Ms. Rosler. ''Would you consider signing this?'' he asked.
''Under no circumstances,'' she said firmly.
To Christian Nagel, 51, her German dealer, Ms. Rosler announced, ''We haven't had time to price any of these because of all the gishray,'' waving a hand at a table of knickknacks and commenting on the messiness.
Mr. Nagel was one of many so-called ''performance facilitators,'' otherwise known as salesclerks, wearing red smocks printed with the words ''Ask Me'' in bright yellow. His colleague, Saskia Draxler, 46, noted later that the event was just like an art fair, except it was easier to make a sale, and you didn't have to wear the towering high heels that are her uniform, she said, at Art Basel. She raised a trouser leg to reveal sensible, low-heeled pumps.
There were lots of shoes, including a pair Doc Martens ($70) and a pair of very worn, pointy-toed, purple Prada loafers ($75), and garment racks hung with clothes. Shoppers sifted through them with deft fingers.
Bonnie Trivizas, 66, was stylishly dressed in a sort of deconstructed sweater and other layers of black and brown in the manner of, say, Rei Kawakubo, circa 1985. ''Mud colors,'' she said. ''The dead colors, that's me!''
She had just bought a bobble-edged scarf ($6, haggled down from $7) that ''went'' perfectly with her outfit. Still, she insisted that she had overpaid. ''That scarf is $4 on the street,'' she said. Ms. Trivizas turned out to be something of an expert; her tunic, which she made from parts of three sweaters bought at flea markets, is an example of the work she sells at the Columbus Avenue Flea most weekends.
Pace Kaminsky was ebullient about his find, a fat unicorn statuette with a rainbow mane he haggled down to $11, from $15. ''My friend called it an albino hippo in drag,'' said Mr. Kaminsky, 43, an art director. ''Look, it's an actual gay icon.'' He turned the piece over to reveal a little stainless steel plaque that read ''Goodies by Gay.''
But this shopper was getting anxious. Two hours had passed, and she hadn't bought a thing. Her companion said, somewhat irritably: ''It all looks real, but it's not. I think you should drop something, make a scene. What are the limits of this performance?''
The shopper ignored him and browsed coffee mugs, some emblazoned with The Onion ($3 each).
''Too ordinary,'' her friend said, steering her to a trio of cow creamers, identical except for their expressions, priced at $12, $11 and $10.
Relieved, the shopper approached a cashier with the $10 cow. ''Do you want to haggle?'' the young woman at the register asked politely.
''Yes, please, may I have it for $5?''
The woman countered: ''$8.'' But when the shopper opened her wallet, there were only two singles inside.
''We can hold it for you,'' the woman said.
The shopper nodded, deflated. She knew she wouldn't return.

HEADLINE: New League For Women Is Announced

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
Plans were announced Wednesday for the launch of yet another Division 1 women's professional soccer league in the United States, the third such effort over the past decade or so. But this one has a twist. 
The as-yet unnamed eight-team circuit -- with teams in New Jersey, western New York, Boston, Washington, Kansas City, Chicago, Seattle and Portland -- will garner major support from the soccer associations in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The league is the successor to the Women's United Soccer Association and Women's Professional Soccer, both of which ceased operation after only three seasons.
"We had 11 groups that were vetted and we decided to start with eight teams," Sunil Gulati, the president of US Soccer, said during a telephone conference call. "The model that will be used will have US Soccer running the front office of the league and funding up to 24 national team players, three per team."
Canada, which will host the next Women's World Cup, in 2015, will pay the salaries of up to 16 of its national team players with the Mexican federation chipping in to foot the bill for up to 12 of its national team players.
Four of the teams, New Jersey, Western New York, Boston and Chicago, were part of W.P.S., which folded last year before the United States went to London and won its second consecutive Olympic gold medal. The Portland club will be operated by Merritt Paulson, who also operated the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer.
Most details remain to be worked out, like how many games the teams will play and in what stadiums, though officials said the new league will try to avoid expensive venues like Toyota Park in Bridgeview, Ill,, where the Chicago Red Stars played previously. Discussions are underway with several potential national sponsors and a television partner. Gulati added that Soccer United Marketing, the marketing arm of M.L.S., is likely to be involved, as it was with W.P.S.
"The real story is that we are trying to create an economic model that is sustainable," Gulati said. "We are subsidizing the private sector to make their investments smaller."
The season is scheduled to begin in March or April and run through September/October. The league will make provisions for FIFA's international dates leading up to the 2015 World Cup and also provide time for national team residency camps in all three countries.
At present, many of the top female players in the United States are signed to contracts with the American federation and are expected to be part of the new league.
After two previous failures, do you think there is a sustainable market for women's professional soccer in the United States?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Helmut Sonnenfeldt Is Dead at 86; Expert on Soviet and European Affairs

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, an expert on Soviet and European affairs who was known as ''Kissinger's Kissinger'' for his influence in advising Henry A. Kissinger, the architect of American foreign policy in the Nixon and Ford administrations, died Sunday in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 86.
The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, his wife, Marjorie, said.
In an interview on Wednesday, Dr. Kissinger, who was national security adviser and secretary of state under President Richard M. Nixon and secretary of state under Gerald R. Ford, called Mr. Sonnenfeldt ''my closest associate'' on Soviet-American relations. 
''He was at my right hand on all the negotiations I conducted with the Soviets,'' including arms control talks, Dr. Kissinger said.
Mr. Sonnenfeldt produced ''thoughtful and penetrating papers'' on Russian intentions in the Middle East and the Helsinki Accords on human rights, among other issues, Dr. Kissinger said. It was a period of easing tensions between the superpowers, despite the war in Vietnam.
Few doubted Mr. Sonnenfeldt's importance, but because he was behind the scenes his influence was not usually visible to the public eye. In 1973, The New York Times called him ''one of the least known men in the Nixon administration.''
But his impact could be forceful. Marvin Kalb, who was Moscow bureau chief for CBS News, wrote in an obituary on the Brookings Institution's Web site that Mr. Sonnenfeldt ''worked feverishly'' to persuade Moscow to proceed with a scheduled summit meeting in 1972 despite the American bombing of Vietnam. The summit led to an arms control treaty and an agreement to coexist peacefully.
Mr. Sonnenfeldt made headlines when the details of a private talk he gave to American ambassadors in December 1975 became public. In the talk he was quoted as advocating a ''more natural and organic'' relationship between the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states.
Conservatives excoriated him, saying he seemed to be giving up on the possibility that the countries might one day escape Moscow's grasp.
Mr. Sonnenfeldt insisted that the comment had been misunderstood. Nevertheless, it became almost immediately known as the ''Sonnenfeldt doctrine.''
In the interview, Dr. Kissinger said Mr. Sonnenfeldt, who was known as a hard-line conservative, meant exactly the opposite: that Eastern European nations would naturally become independent.
''What he said is what happened,'' Dr. Kissinger said. ''What he meant to say is that if you let things develop, they will eventually secede.''
Dr. Kissinger and Mr. Sonnenfeldt had much in common. Both were native Germans and scholars of international affairs who had been educated in the United States. They met as soldiers in the United States Army. After the war, Dr. Kissinger pursued a career in academia and research organizations, while Mr. Sonnenfeldt worked in government, rising in the State Department.
The two remained friends, and days after Nixon was elected, Dr. Kissinger persuaded him to transfer Mr. Sonnenfeldt to the National Security Council staff. But their unequal status led to tensions.
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Kalb, who knew both men well, called their relationship ''subdued but contentious.''
In ''Kissinger: A Biography,'' Walter Isaacson wrote in 1992 that Mr. Sonnenfeldt had resented being treated as if he were a Kissinger staff member rather than as ''an official in his own right who deserved independent access to the president.'' He quoted Mr. Sonnenfeldt as characterizing Dr. Kissinger's behavior as ''a manifestation of his insecurity.''
In his 2000 book, ''Years of Renewal,'' Dr. Kissinger wrote that Mr. Sonnenfeldt had carefully watched the comings and goings from Dr. Kissinger's office and that when someone involved with Russian and Eastern European policy appeared, he would hustle to join the meeting.
''Hal has the best intelligence system in town,'' Dr. Kissinger quoted an aide as saying, using a familiar name for Mr. Sonnenfeldt. ''Unfortunately, it's aimed at you.''
But on Wednesday, Dr. Kissinger dismissed speculation that there had been jealousy between the men, calling it ''silly'' but probably inescapable.
''Look, I was a secretary of state,'' he said. ''He was a counselor.''
Helmut Sonnenfeldt was born in Berlin on Sept. 13, 1926. In 1938, his parents, Jewish doctors, sent him and his brother, Richard, to an English boarding school set up for youths who had fled Nazi Germany. The parents passed through Sweden before emigrating to the United States, where they were reunited with their sons in Baltimore during World War II, Richard in 1942 and Helmut in 1944.
Helmut soon enlisted in the Army and was sent to the Philippines, where he drove a tractor-trailer truck on the docks. After Japan's surrender, he was sent to Germany, where he worked in intelligence. There, in 1946, he met Dr. Kissinger, who was also working in military intelligence. He later earned bachelor's and master's degrees in political science from Johns Hopkins University.
Hired by the State Department in 1952, Mr. Sonnenfeldt rose to director of the office of research and analysis for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Times called him an often brusque and ''demanding taskmaster'' and quoted a woman as saying he ''would tell you you look fat.'' Within days after Nixon's election in 1968, Dr. Kissinger chose him for his National Security Council staff.
In 1973, when George P. Shultz was promoted from budget director to secretary of the Treasury, he nominated Mr. Sonnenfeldt to be deputy secretary in charge of geopolitical economic issues, the No. 3 job in the department. Conservative senators opposed the appointment, contending that Mr. Sonnenfeldt had years earlier leaked classified information. He denied the allegation.
Many analysts suggested that the larger reason the senators had resisted his appointment was to register opposition to the relaxed relations with the Soviet Union, a policy known as détente, which Mr. Sonnenfeldt had helped engineer. He was confirmed by the Senate after five months.
But by then Dr. Kissinger had named him counselor of the State Department, a sort of jack-of-all-trades adviser. He was easily confirmed and remained in the post after Nixon resigned in 1974 and served for the duration of the Ford administration.
Mr. Sonnenfeldt went on to be a visiting scholar at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins and a guest scholar at Brookings.
Besides his wife, the former Marjorie Hecht, of the department store family, Mr. Sonnenfeldt is survived by his daughter, Babette Lubben; his sons Walter and Stewart; and six grandchildren. His brother Richard, who was the chief interpreter for American prosecutors at the Nuremberg war crimes trials and part of the RCA team that developed color television, died in 2009.
In 1982, as a specialist in Soviet affairs, Mr. Sonnenfeldt accompanied Dr. Kissinger on a boar-hunting expedition with Soviet leaders, including Leonid Brezhnev, then in his last year of presiding over the Soviet Union.
At one point, Newsweek reported, Mr. Brezhnev showed his guests his new hunting lodge, replete with a movie theater, and asked what it would sell for in the United States. Dr. Kissinger guessed $400,000, and Brezhnev's face fell. Mr. Sonnenfeldt suggested $2 million, and the supreme Communist beamed with pride.

HEADLINE: Tallying the Debt: The Ex-Comptroller General's View

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his Nov. 12 column, ''Hawks and Hypocrites,'' Paul Krugman prescribes a fiscal course that could be dangerous for this country. Mr. Krugman says we need more deficit spending, not less, and that ''deficit scolds'' (like me, in his view) have other motives that have nothing to do with the nation's well-being. Let's put aside the attacks and look instead at the simple math. 
We currently have over $16 trillion in total federal debt. That is up from $5.7 trillion in 2000, and it is rising very rapidly. However, our true financial condition is much worse when you factor in the government's other liabilities and unfunded promises, including Social Security and Medicare. By that measure, we are facing a mind-boggling federal financial hole of more than $71 trillion, and the hole is getting deeper by $100 billion for every week that Congress and President Obama fail to achieve a fiscal ''grand bargain.''
Clearly this is a recipe for disaster down the road -- higher taxes and interest rates and less money for investments in our future, such as education and infrastructure. It also presents a serious threat to future employment opportunities, our social safety net and even our national security. It is no exaggeration to say that our collective future is at risk for future generations if we don't take action to restore fiscal sanity.
The huge I.O.U. we are preparing to pass along to our children and grandchildren is shameful, even immoral. Mr. Krugman concludes his column by saying ''we should be having a serious discussion about America's fiscal future.'' He is right. But this serious conversation has to begin by casting ideology aside and telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to the American people. That is what I try to do.
DAVID M. WALKER Bridgeport, Conn., Nov. 19, 2012
The writer was United States comptroller general from 1998 to 2008.

HEADLINE: Egypt's Leader Is Crucial Link In Gaza Deal

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Peter Baker reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama skipped dessert at a long summit meeting dinner in Cambodia on Monday to rush back to his hotel suite. It was after 11:30 p.m., and his mind was on rockets in Gaza rather than Asian diplomacy. He picked up the telephone to call the Egyptian leader who is the new wild card in his Middle East calculations.
Over the course of the next 25 minutes, he and President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt hashed through ways to end the latest eruption of violence, a conversation that would lead Mr. Obama to send Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to the region. As he and Mr. Morsi talked, Mr. Obama felt they were making a connection. Three hours later, at 2:30 in the morning, they talked again.
The cease-fire brokered between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday was the official unveiling of this unlikely new geopolitical partnership, one with bracing potential if not a fair measure of risk for both men. After a rocky start to their relationship, Mr. Obama has decided to invest heavily in the leader whose election caused concern because of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, seeing in him an intermediary who might help make progress in the Middle East beyond the current crisis in Gaza. 
The White House phone log tells part of the tale. Mr. Obama talked with Mr. Morsi three times within 24 hours and six times over the course of several days, an unusual amount of one-on-one time for a president. Mr. Obama told aides he was impressed with the Egyptian leader's pragmatic confidence. He sensed an engineer's precision with surprisingly little ideology. Most important, Mr. Obama told aides that he considered Mr. Morsi a straight shooter who delivered on what he promised and did not promise what he could not deliver.
''The thing that appealed to the president was how practical the conversations were -- here's the state of play, here are the issues we're concerned about,'' said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ''This was somebody focused on solving problems.''
The Egyptian side was also positive about the collaboration. Essam el-Haddad, the foreign policy adviser to the Egyptian president, described a singular partnership developing between Mr. Morsi, who is the most important international ally for Hamas, and Mr. Obama, who plays essentially the same role for Israel.
''Yes, they were carrying the point of view of the Israeli side but they were understanding also the other side, the Palestinian side,'' Mr. Haddad said in Cairo as the cease-fire was being finalized on Wednesday. ''We felt there was a high level of sincerity in trying to find a solution. The sincerity and understanding was very helpful.''
The fledgling partnership forged in the fires of the past week may be ephemeral, a unique moment of cooperation born out of necessity and driven by national interests that happened to coincide rather than any deeper meeting of the minds. Some longtime students of the Middle East cautioned against overestimating its meaning, recalling that Mr. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood constitutes a philosophical brother of Hamas even if it has renounced violence itself and become the governing party in Cairo.
''I would caution the president from believing that President Morsi has in any way distanced himself from his ideological roots,'' said Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''But if the president takes away the lesson that we can affect Egypt's behavior through the artful use of leverage, that's a good lesson. You can shape his behavior. You can't change his ideology.''
Other veterans of Middle East policy agreed with the skepticism yet saw the seeds of what might eventually lead to broader agreement.
''It really is something with the potential to establish a new basis for diplomacy in the region,'' said Tamara Cofman Wittes, who was Mr. Obama's deputy assistant secretary of state for the Middle East until earlier this year and now runs the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. ''It's just potential, but it's particularly impressive potential.''
The relationship between the two leaders has come a long way in just 10 weeks. Mr. Morsi's election in June as the first Islamist president of Egypt set nerves in Washington on edge and raised questions about the future of Egypt's three-decade-old peace treaty with Israel. Matters worsened in September when Egyptian radicals protesting an anti-Islam video stormed the United States Embassy in Cairo.
Mr. Obama was angry that the Egyptian authorities did not do more to protect the embassy and that Mr. Morsi had not condemned the attack. He called Mr. Morsi to complain vigorously in what some analysts now refer to as the woodshed call. Mr. Morsi responded with more security for the embassy and strong public statements that the attackers ''do not represent any of us.''
Washington was again leery when the Gaza conflict broke out last week and Mr. Morsi sent his prime minister to meet with Hamas. But as days passed, Mr. Obama found in his phone calls that Mr. Morsi recognized the danger of an escalating conflict.
During their phone call on Monday night, Mr. Obama broached the idea of sending Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Morsi agreed it would help. The president then called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to talk through the idea. At 2:30 a.m., having changed out of his suit into sweats, Mr. Obama called Mr. Morsi back to confirm that Mrs. Clinton would come.
After leaving Phnom Penh the next day en route back to Washington, Mr. Obama picked up the phone aboard Air Force One to call Mr. Morsi to say Mrs. Clinton was on the way. By Wednesday, he was on the phone again with Mr. Netanyahu urging him to accept the cease-fire and then with Mr. Morsi, congratulating him.
''From Day 1, we had contacts with both sides,'' said Mr. Haddad, but the United States stepped in ''whenever there was a point at which there would be a need for further encouragement and a push to get it across.'' Mr. Haddad said the United States played an important role ''trying to send clear signals to the Israeli side that there should not be a waste of time and an agreement must be reached.''
''They have really been very helpful in pushing the Israeli side,'' he said.
In pushing Hamas, Mr. Morsi came under crosscurrents of his own. On one side, advisers acknowledged, he felt the pressure of the Egyptian electorate's strong support for the Palestinian cause and antipathy toward Israel as well as his own personal and ideological ties to the Islamists in Hamas. But on the other side, advisers said, Mr. Morsi had committed to the cause of regional stability, even if it meant disappointing his public.
Analysts further noted that Mr. Morsi needed the United States as he secures a $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund at a time of economic trouble. ''There's no way Egypt is going to have any kind of economic recovery without Washington,'' said Khaled Elgindy, an adviser to the Palestinian negotiators during the last decade.
As for Mr. Obama, his aides said they were willing to live with some of Mr. Morsi's more populist talk as long as he proves constructive on the substance. ''The way we've been able to work with Morsi,'' said one official, ''indicates we could be a partner on a broader set of issues going forward.''

HEADLINE: Thanksgiving's Hispanic Roots, America's Hispanic Future

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: For most Americans, Thanksgiving recalls the Pilgrims and Plymouth Rock. A rival claim says the first Thanksgiving was hosted in Florida by the Spanish. On the verge of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of North America by Ponce de Leon, Spain challenges the Anglos' for their rightful place in American history. 

 BODY:
MADRID - The tradition that the Pilgrim fathers celebrated America's first Thanksgiving feast in 1621 is once again being challenged by those who insist the Spanish beat them to it - by more than half a century.
The claim has been around since the 1960s, when Michael Gannon, a University of Florida professor, asserted that the first Thanksgiving in what is now the United States actually took place in St. Augustine, Florida on September 8, 1565.
The city was founded that year by Don Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, a Spanish admiral and explorer, and his 800 followers. 
To celebrate the establishment of the colony, they are said to have celebrated mass and shared a Thanksgiving meal of game and squash, and maybe even turkey, with the local Timucuantribe.
The rival claim has done little to dent the myth that the first Thanksgiving honors belong to the Pilgrim fathers and the Wampanoagtribe. "The English wrote the history and established the traditions," Professor Gannon said in a 2007 interview. "That's life. Get over it."
With the growing size and importance of the Hispanic community in the United States, however, the alternative tradition might gain some traction as Latinos seek out their country's Spanish and Catholic roots.
Even non-Hispanic Floridians are booking study trips to Spain to learn about their country's Spanish connections ahead of next year's 500th anniversary of the European discovery of North America by Juan Ponce de León.
Delfin Carbonell Basset revived the St. Augustine Thanksgiving story this week at Voxxi, an English-language Latino Website. 
In a separate article on the United States' Spanish legacy, he asked why Daniel Boone, the frontier pioneer, was better known in America than Don Juan de Oñate, a native-born explorer who opened trails and founded settlements in what is now the U.S. Southwest.
"Daniel Boone became a legend in his own lifetime and continues to be a legend," he wrote. "Juan de Oñate was not considered a legend in his own lifetime or even a hero today. However, the history of the American Southwest cannot be understood without him."
Such appeals to Hispanic pride, and the increasing profile of the Latino community in the United States, have not been overlooked in the old country.
Commenting on this month's U.S. elections, Spain's daily ABC wrote: "The Hispanic factor is gaining ever more weight in the life of the United States."
The newspaper said the Latino vote had been vital to President Obama's re-election and noted that the new Congress would have more Hispanic members than ever.
The same newspaper carried an interview with Rep. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, who said that Anglo-Saxons no longer dominated U.S. politics.
"Demographic change is allowing us to start exercising political power," the Democratic congressman told ABC. "In the past it was Anglo-Saxon communities that dominated national politics. Now we're seeing a change."
According to Spain's La Razón, the conservative Madrid government has praised President Obama's "Hispanidad", noting the president's belief in the key role of Hispanic culture in his country's future.
Interest in Hispanic-related developments in the U.S. has even reached Avilés, the northern Spanish birthplace of the founder of St. Augustine. 
The local La Voz de Avilés, reporting on the claim that Don Pedro hosted the first Thanksgiving in America, declared: "That would be the last straw for the Anglos."

HIGHLIGHT: Odds and ends. 

 BODY:
Well, I've been told that thanks to the other family members present, my presence in the kitchen is not required, in fact is strongly discouraged. So, some odds and ends relating to previous posts. 
On the role of international competition or the lack thereof in making decent wages possible: This stuff is my home field; it's an area where I really, really know what I'm talking about. Here's an old essay I wrote on the impact of Asia's rise on the US, which is just the flip side of the alleged gains from a ruined Europe. The numbers have changed over the past 18 years; in particular, trade with low-wage countries is now much bigger, so that the distributional stories have more force. But the basics are there.
Oh, and this whole subject illustrates the importance of actually having a model -- a story that describes what people do and how they interact -- when you discuss economic issues, as opposed to just spouting off plausible-sounding rhetoric.
On the age of the Earth: I originally learned about all this from John McPhee, and it turns out that a lovely discussion of Hutton and all that is available online (pdf).
On the great Republican polling debacle: Dan Senor says that it was a "systemic problem" with polling. Except that if you actually did any kind of simple poll averaging, you got the race right. Senor does admit that the problem may have been more acute on the right-wing side, but then says that it wasn't just on that side, because Rasmussen got it wrong. May I say that not considering Rasmussen to be "on the Republican side" tells you everything you need to know about the GOP's analytical capacity, right there?
And you know what does illustrate a systemic problem? The fact that Senor, whose main claim to fame is his disastrous role as PR flack for the catastrophic Iraq occupation, is somehow considered an expert on something within his party.
Now, back to the big bird.

HEADLINE: Give Pot a Chance

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Forget all the lame jokes about Cheech and Chong: social revolutions in a democracy should not be lightly dismissed. 

 BODY:
SEATTLE - In two weeks, adults in this state will no longer be arrested or incarcerated for something that nearly 30 million Americans did last year. For the first time since prohibition began 75 years ago, recreational marijuana use will be legal; the misery-inducing crusade to lock up thousands of ordinary people has at last been seen, by a majority of voters in this state and in Colorado, for what it is: a monumental failure. 
That is, unless the Obama administration steps in with an injunction, as it has threatened to in the past, against common sense. For what stands between ending this absurd front in the dead-ender war on drugs and the status quo is the federal government. It could intervene, citing the supremacy of federal law that still classifies marijuana as a dangerous drug. 
But it shouldn't. Social revolutions in a democracy, especially ones that begin with voters, should not be lightly dismissed. Forget all the lame jokes about Cheetos and Cheech and Chong. In the two-and-a-half weeks since a pair of progressive Western states sent a message that arresting 853,000 people a year for marijuana offenses is an insult to a country built on individual freedom, a whiff of positive, even monumental change is in the air.

In Mexico, where about 60,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence, political leaders are voicing cautious optimism that the tide could turn for the better. What happens when the United States, the largest consumer of drugs in the world, suddenly opts out of a black market that is the source of gangland death and corruption? That question, in small part, may now be answered. 
Prosecutors in Washington and Colorado have announced they are dropping cases, effective immediately, against people for pot possession. I've heard from a couple of friends who are police officers, and guess what: they have a lot more to do than chase around recreational drug users. 
Maine (ever-sensible Maine!) and Iowa, where the political soil is uniquely suited to good ideas, are looking to follow the Westerners. Within a few years, it seems likely that a dozen or more states will do so as well. 
And for one more added measure of good karma, on Election Day, Representative Dan Lungren, nine-term Republican from California and a tired old drug warrior who backed some of the most draconian penalties against his fellow citizens, was ousted from office. 
But there remains the big question of how President Obama will handle the cannabis spring. So far, he and Attorney General Eric Holder have been silent. I take that as a good sign, and certainly a departure from the hard-line position they took when California voters were considering legalization a few years ago. But if they need additional nudging, here are three reasons to let reason stand:
 Hypocrisy. Popular culture and the sports-industrial complex would collapse without all the legal drugs that promise to extend erections, reduce inhibitions and keep people awake all night. I'm talking to you, Viagra, alcohol and high-potency energy drinks. Worse, perhaps, is the $25 billion nutritional supplement industry, offerings pills that make exaggerated health claims and steroid-based hormones that can have significant bad consequences. The corporate cartels behind these products get away with minimal regulation because of powerful backers like Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. 
In two years through 2011, more than 2,200 serious illnesses, including 33 fatalities, were reported by consumers of nutritional supplements. Federal officials have received reports of 13 deaths and 92 serious medical events from Five Hour Energy. And how many people died of marijuana ingestion? Of course, just because well-marketed, potentially hazardous potions are legal is no argument to bring pot onto retail shelves. But it's hard to make a case for fairness when one person's method of relaxation is cause for arrest while another's lands him on a Monday night football ad. 
 Tax and regulate. Already, 18 states and the District of Columbia allow medical use of marijuana. This chaotic and unregulated system has resulted in price-gouging, phony prescriptions and outright scams. No wonder the pot dispensaries have opposed legalization - it could put them out of business.
Washington State officials estimate that taxation and regulation of licensed marijuana retail stores will generate $532 million in new revenue every year. Expand that number nationwide, and then also add into the mix all the wasted billions now spent investigating and prosecuting marijuana cases. 
With pot out of the black market, states can have a serious discussion about use and abuse. The model is the campaign against drunk driving, which has made tremendous strides and saved countless lives at a time when alcohol is easier to get than ever before. Education, without one-sided moralizing, works. 
 Lead. That's what transformative presidents do. From his years as a community organizer - and a young man whose own recreational drug use could have made him just another number in lockup - Obama knows well that racial minorities are disproportionately jailed for these crimes. With 5 percent of the world's population, the United States has 25 percent of its prisoners - and about 500,000 of them are behind bars for drug offenses. On cost alone - up to $60,000 a year, to taxpayers, per prisoner - this is unsustainable.
Obama is uniquely suited to make the argument for change. On this issue, he'll have support from the libertarian right and the humanitarian left. The question is not the backing - it's whether the president will have the backbone.

HEADLINE: Vignettes of Black Friday

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The Lede is checking out the mood of Black Friday shoppers as the economically critical holiday season kicks off. In Times Square, some had been anticipating a sale for months. 

 BODY:
With promotions, discounts and doorbusters already well under way on Thanksgiving Day itself, many big-box retailers are making Black Friday stretch longer than ever. The Lede is checking out the mood of American consumers in occasional vignettes Thursday and Friday as the economically critical holiday shopping season kicks off.
 4:41 P.M. | Life in the Slow Lane 
Not far from the frantic crush of local malls, the merchants of downtown Upland, Calif., quietly rolled a few racks of merchandise out to the sidewalks under the bright sun of an 80-degree day. They stood back and waited. 
At 10 a.m., a few shoppers started to stroll through town. But it was hardly a hotbed of consumer activity.
"I think we're going to get a little bit more business tomorrow than today," said Jake McCarty, assistant manager at Roy's Cyclery, which has been in business since 1962. "People think most small shops are going to be closed on Black Friday."
The downtown business district of Upland, a 14-block area that sits 35 miles east of Los Angeles, dates from the citrus boom of the 1890s. With more than a dozen restaurants and nearly 200 businesses, the area has seen both better times and worse. If anything, it's showing a slight uptick from the recent economic crash, with city sales tax revenue up about by 2 percentage points in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, according to Jeff Zwack, the city's development service director.
But you wouldn't necessarily sense the comeback Friday, since the local merchants association has taken pains to avoid competing with the giant retailers on their big day. In fact, Historic Downtown Upland Inc. was planning a "shop till you drop" event for the evening of Dec. 13, with music, sidewalk sales and Santa stationed in the gazebo in the center of town.
Despite the low expectations, a few crowd-averse shoppers wandered the streets.
Brandi Koenke, 40, of Claremont, stopped in the Utility Boardshop with her family of four. It was their second stop after a quick venture into a nearby Kohl's discount department store. The shop was offering a discount on a watch that she was looking at for her 15-year-old son, Ryan.
After the experience at Kohl's, she said, "this was much nicer. No crowds." It was her last stop for the day.
Down the street at the bike shop, Kendrick Stallard emerged with a small bag of supplies.
"This has nothing to do with the fact that the Friday is black," said Mr. Stallard, a 22-year-old choreographer from Fontana. "We're going on a bike adventure, and we couldn't care less." 
Across the street, Mary Aneen slowly made her way through the displays in front of the antique stores. "I don't shop on Black Friday," she said. "Too many people, too many lines, and you never get what you want. I like antiques."
Down the street, next to the Metrolink commuter train station, Fred Paciocco, owner of Pacific Wine Merchants, had time to give a tour of the shop, which is in a city-owned former Santa Fe train station built in 1937. He pointed out the specially ordered light fixtures, the original cabinetry and the old ticket counter that now serves as the back bar for wine tasting.
Mr. Paciocco took the slow start on Friday in stride; he had done good business in the days leading up to Thanksgiving, and he expected to do well at Christmas, too.
"We're like most retailers," he said. "If you don't do it in November or December, you're not going to make it."

 3:15 P.M. | Hunting TVs and Telephones in the Great North 
Shoppers waiting outside Sam's Club in Eagan, Minn., for Friday's 7 a.m. opening clung to free Starbuck's Holiday Blend coffee as they endured freezing temperatures and biting winds and collected brightly colored vouchers for laptops and big-screen TVs. 
The biggest draw: a 96-cent Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone. Once inside, they beelined for tickets for the 63 in stock, which sold out shortly after the store opened. Customers could make an appointment for later in the day or another day to purchase the phone, choosing from three carriers, Verizon, T-Mobile or Sprint. 
"O.K., this is my last blue for Sprint," an employee called out at 7:08 a.m.
Erin Mustonen, 23, a consultant from Eagan who graduated from college last December, was the first in line outside Sam's, arriving with her boyfriend at 5:30 a.m. and snagging a 65-inch Vizio Smart TV for $998. It was sweet redemption since she was the 21st shopper to seek a 60-inch Vizio Thursday night at nearby Walmart, which had 20 in stock. 
Sam's early-bird shoppers voiced satisfaction in having had a normal Thanksgiving celebration, bucking the Thursday-night push.
"I don't like it," said Denny Johnson, 66, a retired property manager from Burnsville who had come for a 51-inch Samsung TV. "They're going to start this on Veterans Day if they keep going." 
Subbamanoz Kristam, a 27-year-old software engineer living in Eagan, stood outside with a friend while their wives huddled in the car - only to learn that the Samsung doorbuster didn't include AT&T customers. The lines seemed longer than last year, he said.
Mr. Kristam's friend, Praveen Elagala, 30, also a software engineer in Eagan, had embarked on his first Black Friday to buy a 55-inch Samsung LED TV for $998. "It's pretty exciting," he said, sipping his coffee. "My wife will be happy." 
Archie Weatherspoon IV, 29, a probation officer from St. Paul, came with his wife and two young boys, who munched on McDonald's hash browns as they awaited a Samsung Galaxy ticket. 
Mr. Weatherspoon had almost called off the plan for their first Black Friday outing after watching a YouTube video of a Thursday night cellphone fight at an out-of-state Walmart. "I don't want to bring my kids out if it's going to be that chaotic," he said. But he decided to trust Sam's for a "more organized" set-up and left with a Samsung ticket and five $9.98 Blu-ray DVDs. 
Chuck Magnusson, 74, a retired highway engineer from Detroit Lakes, bought a Samsung Galaxy for Sprint's unlimited texting plan so he could keep up with his dexterous kids. 
Jeff Sengbusch, 48, a health care support clinician from South St. Paul, hazarded his first Black Friday in more than 20 years. "I've worked maintenance at a mall - I've seen arms broken, people shoved and kids trampled," he said.
Concerned about the economy and President Obama's re-election, Mr. Sengbusch said he planned to cut holiday buying way back, having typically spent $250 to $300 on each of his children. "I'm setting a $50 limit because I can't afford the future taxes. I can only give so much." 
Others succumbed to Black Friday whims. "I didn't even want it," Meshia Flood, 36, a student from Eagan, told a worker standing near the exit, referring to the 40-inch Sanyo LED TV on her cart. She and her 13-year-old daughter had come for the Samsung Galaxy but hadn't managed to snag one of the Verizon phones, which disappeared minutes after opening.

 2:02 P.M. | Electronics Sell Well 
At a Kmart in Memphis, hours before the sun rose on Black Friday, there was already a return. Alton Hays taped up a box and brought back a wet-dry vacuum he purchased on Thursday. It didn't have wheels and was missing its wand.
But many other electronic items were still going out the door. Most of the sleep-deprived shoppers were there for the handful of "doorbuster" deals worth some effort, they said: televisions priced at an average $200 off regular price and discounted washers/dryers, telephones and cameras. 
Kinson Fant, 37, wanted one of the larger televisions, but the store's limited stock was already spoken for through tickets passed out earlier. Ms. Fant, who lost her job at Nike's distribution center in Memphis six days earlier, settled for a 19-inch television for $88.
When Glenda Wallace, a long-haul truck driver, finished her wait in the electronics line - the longest one in the store - she wheeled her shopping cart carrying her 52-inch television she just bought to the opposite end of the store to begin another hour or two wait in the second-longest line - the one for layaways. 
She ended up buying one television, receiving a raincheck on a second one and putting a third in layaway all for herself.
Last year, she said, she spent $7,000 on Christmas presents for her family. She's told them all this year that things will be different. Not because of the economy - just because.
"I'm spending less this year. I sure am," Ms. Wallace said. "Because, I ain't buying nobody nothing! You can save a lot of money that way. They got all they needed from me last year."
Others said they cut back spending for other reasons. "We're spending less this year because we've found better deals," said 31-year-old Regina Woods, a child care provider, who was in the Kmart electronics line with her husband, 37-year-old Daryl Woods.

 1:47 P.M. | Bargain-Hunting on a Tight Budget 
Matt and Veronica Lynagh of Columbus, Ohio, made a series of financial changes after their daughter was born last December that radically changed their approach to Christmas shopping this year.
Veronica, 29, quit her job this year as a director of sales for the Columbus Dispatch newspaper to start her own marketing consulting business so that she could spend more time at home with the baby. They used some of their savings to pay off credit card debt. They refinanced their home, saving them $200 a month. Matt, 30, who works at Jegs, an auto parts supply company, traded his Dodge Ram 1500 Crew Cab pickup for a Mazda 6 SUV, which saved them $250 a month on gas. They also started aggressively putting money into savings. 
They also got serious about budgeting. They created a spreadsheet that's color-coded for income and spending. A few months ago, Veronica used the spreadsheet to set $700 aside to prepare for holiday shopping. 
"Our feeling now is to spend, but do it responsibly," Veronica said.
Another reason for their belt-tightening was political. They both voted for Mitt Romney, largely because they worry about runaway government spending under President Obama. "We're nervous" about Obama's re-election, Veronica said. "Our government is spending money we don't have. Somebody eventually will pay that off, and it will be my daughter."
So this year, they won't buy any presents with credit cards. They'll use their bank cash cards instead. "We don't put anything on credit anymore," Matt said.
Meanwhile, they use the same shopping system that they have for years, in which Matt does the bulk of the Black Friday shopping. His strategy is to avoid popular stores like Walmart, where there are often long lines, focusing instead on smaller locations. When he arrives, he finds the nearest uniformed employee, points at a desired item in the store's Black Friday newspaper ad, and asks, "Where's this?" He walks briskly to the indicated spot, grabs the gift and heads straight for the cashier.
"I feel it would be really stupid to pay full price this season when all the stores have such good deals," Matt said.
After using his system at Toys "R" Us and spending $135.02 on gifts for his daughter, he drove to Best Buy, where the line was still wrapped around the building, even though the store had opened at midnight, an hour and a half earlier. 
"Forget that," he said. "I wanted a hard drive for photos, but I'm not going to wait in line for that."

 12:04 P.M. | Protests at Walmarts 
 3:55 P.M. | Updated

Walmart faced not only a throng of shoppers on Black Friday, but what a union-backed group said was the biggest wave of protests that the retailer has faced. On Thursday night, there were protests at Walmart stores in Miami, Dallas and Milwaukee, part of what the group, OUR Walmart, said would be rallies at 1,000 Walmart stores in 46 states.
In Milwaukee, more than 50 workers and their allies demonstrated outside a Walmart store, and in Kenosha, Wisc., more than 30 did, carrying signs that spelled out, "Respect the Workers." In Quincy, Mass., two dozen workers and their supporters demonstrated during the night, with an illuminated projection on the store's outside walls saying, "Massachusetts Supports Walmart Workers Rights," the labor group said. On Friday morning in the Washington, D.C., area, several hundred people - a combination of Walmart workers and their supporters, many from various labor unions - demonstrated at a series of Walmart stores.
OUR Walmart - its formal name is Organization United for Respect at Walmart - clams several thousand Walmart employees as members and said that many of them would not report to work Friday in what the group says is a strike. The group, which works closely with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said its members were protesting what it said was retaliation by Walmart managers against employees who speak out about their wages, part-time hours and working conditions.
Walmart officials have repeatedly called the protests "a publicity stunt." The company issued a statement Friday saying that 26 protests had occurred at its stores on Thursday night. "Many of them did not include any Walmart associates," the company said. It estimated that fewer than 50 Walmart employees had participated in the protests on Thanksgiving evening.
"In fact, this year, roughly the same number of associates missed their scheduled shift as last year," Bill Simon, the company's chief executive officer, said in the statement.
Nancy Cleeland, spokeswoman for the National Labor Relations Board, said the labor board would not respond on Friday to a complaint that Walmart filed last week asking for a court injunction to bar the protests.
In a news release issued by OUR Walmart, Colby Harris, a member of the group and a Walmart employee for three years who said he walked off the job in Lancaster, Texas, said, "Our voices are being heard. And thousands of people in our cities and towns and all across the country are joining our calls for change at Walmart."
Walmart's 1.4 million employees in the United States are not unionized, and some of them have complained about their wages, lack of rights and the company's hostile attitude toward any employee support for a union. Walmart has asserted that the protests are yet another union-engineered effort to harass and apply pressure to the company after the United Food and Commercial Workers has repeatedly failed in its efforts to unionize various Walmart stores.
 Update: 
In what organizers said was one of the biggest protests, more than 500 people - Walmart employees, community backers and some members of the clergy - rallied outside the Walmart store in Paramount, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb. Some of those protesters were arrested after engaging in civil disobedience by blocking Lakewood Boulevard.
Walmart officials said that most of the protesters were not company employees, but rather community supporters, and said some had been bussed from store to store to engage in multiple protests.
Dan Schlademan, one of the protests' main organizers and the director of Making Change at Wal-Mart, an arm of the food and commercial workers union, said that hundreds of Walmart workers had gone on strike on Friday and engaged in protests across the country. But he acknowledged that most of the demonstrators were community allies, saying they shared the goal of pressing Wal-Mart to improve wages and to stop what they say is widespread retaliation.

 10:16 A.M. | As Black Friday Goes, So Goes the Economy? 
Analysts and investors pay a lot of attention to Black Friday figures and anecdotes, hoping that they will provide some insight into the consumer psyche and by extension the overall economy. Consumer spending, after all, represents about 70 percent of total economic output, and Black Friday is the most hyped shopping day of the year.
But it's not clear how much Black Friday activity actually tells us about the underlying health of the economy, or even about how much consumers are going to spend in the subsequent few weeks.
"History suggests that strong sales on Black Friday tend to be followed by weak sales over the rest of the holidays and that weak sales on Black Friday tend to be followed by strong sales later on," Paul Dales, senior United States economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients, adding that the overall relationship between sales during Thanksgiving week and sales over the entire holiday season is weak.
"This would make sense if people have a fixed amount of cash that they allocate to either Black Friday or the rest of the holidays," he said. "Good Black Friday sales may then just mean that households have brought forward some of their holiday spending."
Consumer confidence has been quite strong in the last few months, in any case, suggesting that people may be willing to spend more money over the whole holiday period than they had in the last few years, regardless of how that spending is staggered over the next few weeks.
"We are in a very peculiar situation where corporations, politicians and financial markets all worry a lot about the 'fiscal cliff,' whereas households don't seem to care," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, referring to the government budget negotiations.
Consumers may be more optimistic because they believe the value of their homes have bottomed out and so they're starting to feel wealthier. The job market is firming up, too.
"Obviously, the unemployment rate is not dropping tons, but it's dropping enough that it's noteworthy and is making people feel more confident about their jobs and their own situation," said Alison Paul, vice chairman and United States retail and distribution leader for Deloitte.
The other good news is there are five weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which is one more than there has been the last couple of years. "Those are the big shopping days, regardless of how much business the stores are doing during the week," said Ms. Paul.

 9:37 A.M. | A Deal's Not Always a Deal 
People come out for Black Friday sales for, among other reasons, the once-a-year deeply discounted bargains. At least, that's what stores want consumers to expect they're getting. But smartphones have enabled consumers to get savvier about fact-checking those "bargains."
Brick-and-mortar stores have responded this year by promising to honor major online competitors' prices. They want to avoid the encroachment of so-called showrooming - shoppers using the physical locations to see what they may buy on the Internet - onto one of their biggest (and most profitable) shopping days of the year.
"This is one of the more profound changes this year because it really puts the power back into the hands of the folks in the stores," said Alison Paul, vice chairman and United States retail and distribution leader at Deloitte. "These are the new rules of the road. For years, the store clerks had no authority to do this."
Best Buy, Target, Fry's Electronics and Staples have all agreed to price-match with at least some online competitors. Target has even installed free Wi-Fi in every store, according to Bryan Everett, the company's senior vice president of stores, even though it makes it easier for customers to check competitors' prices.
"That speaks to our level of confidence in our pricing," he said. "We've worked very hard on our pricing this year to make sure it's sharp and people can shop with confidence."
Consumer analysts and advocates recommend putting your smartphone to good use and price-checking, since Black Friday "deals" aren't always just that.
"About a third of the time it's not a good deal," said Mike Fridgen, chief executive of Decide, a price-prediction Web site. "Some are egregious," he said, citing some offers he has seen for headphones. "That price has risen over the last few weeks as we've been getting closer to the holidays, and now they're discounting it back to a level similar to what it was weeks ago, but not the lowest we've seen."
Another reason brick-and-mortar stores may be slowing the loss of customers to online competitors is that more states have started forcing online retailers to pay sales taxes. That's chipping away at the pricing edge of some major companies like Amazon.com, according to Nelson Granados, professor at the Graziadio School of Business and Management at Pepperdine University.

 9:14 a.m. | Searching for Significance 
On Twitter, some people are wondering what Black Friday sales will mean for the economy and the markets, minutes before they open in New York:

 8:21 A.M. | Was Black Thursday Good for Retailers? 
Early Friday, retail executives were already starting to assess how their decision to start Black Friday well before midnight on Thursday had affected consumer behavior.
Bryan Everett, Target's senior vice president of stores, said that Target's decision to open at 9 p.m. on Thursday rather than midnight this year resulted in more families in the store and in customers staying longer.
"Usually it's just a parent with a child, or mom and dad, or just a single guest in the store," he said, drawing on his previous 10 years of observing Black Fridays at Target. "This year we were seeing four- to five-person families."
He said as a consequence, there was more "cross-shopping" this year: in addition to the surge in big-screen LCD TVs, iPads, iPods, DVDs and Xboxes, "we saw a nice pattern of shopping in the apparel and home departments." Kids' pajamas, blankets, sheets sets, pillows and scarves all did particularly well.
Mr. Everett did not yet have any specific sales numbers to report, but based on anecdotal reports he said he believed the volume of customers was about the same as last year, while shopping carts were fuller.

 8:09 A.M. | A Civic Duty to Shop After Sandy 
It was cold and dark, with the end of Thanksgiving only four hours old, when Ines Wishart awoke, donned a hat and winter's coat and stood in line under the pale glow of parking lot lights at the Lord & Taylor in Westfield, N.J., for Black Friday.
"We really want to support the downtown and the businesses here after what happened," said Ms. Wishart, 49, a teacher who lives in Westfield and was without power for a week after Hurricane Sandy.
Around the region, shopping centers and downtowns that had been frozen by the late October hurricane bustled with shoppers during paperboy hours on Friday. Some, like Ms. Wishart, said they came out of a sense of civic duty to help hometown businesses recover revenue. And others, like Genevieve Cece, 33, a homemaker who lives in neighboring Clark, N.J., and lost power for four days, said shopping was a way to put behind them the storm's bad memories.
"You come out to shop and get back to normal. You've got to move forward with your life," she said, carting a Lord & Taylor bag from the store.
For the majority of Friday's insomniac consumers, the motivation to stimulate the local economy was far more personal than public. When asked for whom they had gotten up at 4:15 a.m. to shop, Westfield residents Susie Katz, 51, and her daughter Maddie Katz, 17, answered in unison.
"Ourselves," they said.
A line of perhaps 150 shoppers snaked from the front door of the Westfield Lord & Taylor deep into the parking lot, and when a church bell tolled five times, dozens more ran up to the line from their idling cars. A woman just inside the door handed out coupons worth $20. By 5:15 a.m., the lot was full, save for the parking spots furthest away. Some shoppers sprinted the length of the lot, trailing huffs of vapor that hung like clouds.
"I wanted that extra $20 off," said Jodi Marvosa, 45, a caterer who lives in Westfield, who bought pajamas, boots and a sweater.
Linda Coleman, who works in education and lives in Westfield, came to the store with her daughter Danielle Coleman, 26, just for the experience.
"It seemed like an adventure. I mean, who gets up at 5 o'clock to shop?" she said. "I'm shocked by how many people are inside."
Elsewhere, the early Black Friday scene was less manic. At the Hudson Mall in Jersey City, which was closed for weeks because of storm damage, Devlyn Courtier, 21, who works at Hudson County Community College, was the only one in line outside the Game Stop at 4 a.m. He said he woke at 3 a.m. and walked to the mall in order to buy a PlayStation system for his girlfriend.
"I wanted to make sure I was one of the first people here," he said.
He added that he knew that the mall had been affected by Sandy, but was surprised by its condition.
"You wouldn't notice it now," he said. "It looks like nothing happened."
For some early morning shoppers, the party started Thanksgiving night and just didn't stop. Brittany Dannunzio and Lindsay Laguna, both 19 of Scotch Plains, drove to Tinton Falls in Monmouth County to shop from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Then they spent a couple of hours in a chrome-covered diner and counted down until the Lord & Taylor's in Westfield opened at 5 a.m.
"I plan on sleeping sometime - I just don't know when," Ms. Dannunzio said later, outside the Victoria's Secret in downtown Westfield.
When the store's doors unlocked at 6 a.m., the two young women squealed, "It's open!" and charged inside. Ms. Laguna said that they would soon go to "whatever opens up next."
For other sleepless shoppers, the morning was more frustrating. Cagla Yavuz, 19, and Yasemin Karamete, 20, of Westfield, spent an anxious night sipping tea and pinching each other to keep from falling asleep only to leave Lord & Taylor empty-handed at 5:15 a.m., grumbling about the crowds.
"Never again," Ms. Yavuz said. "We didn't even try anything on. People were pushing and shoving - the lines were ridiculous."
Ms. Karamete, who had hoped to buy some Ugg boots, said she was now looking forward to shopping on the day after Christmas.

 7:50 A.M. | Macy's Mayhem 
Who exactly are all those crazy people who go to Macy's at midnight for Black Friday?
Turns out a lot of them have been pondering that very question themselves, and finally decided to show up to see what the big deal was.
"We've been hearing about this for years in Canada, where we don't have Black Friday," said Donna Ward, 48, from just outside Toronto, who was waiting outside the flagship Macy's at Herald Square around 11:20 p.m. on Thursday. "We came just to see what's there to see. We want to see the stampedes!"
When the doors opened at precisely midnight, huddled masses of about 11,000 streamed in, according to Jim Sluzewski, a spokesman for Macy's. They burst in like water at the seams of a leaky ship, gushing in from all nine entrances, running and cheering, with their arms pumping above their heads like marathoners crossing the finishing line.
"Let's get in front of the cameras!" called Andre Hejazi, 19, from Salt Lake City, as he charged in with his friend Latoya Boender, 23, from Holland, both mugging for the dozens of journalists squatting inside the entrance to capture the mayhem.
The crowd was mostly young again this year, Mr. Sluzewski said. He noted that this was the second year the store opened its doors around midnight instead of a few hours before dawn on Friday. The younger Black Friday clientele may not be unique to Macy's; a Gallup poll found that more than a third of Americans aged 18-29 planned on shopping on Black Friday this year, compared to just 18 percent of American adults over all.
The Macy's crowd after midnight was full of foreign tourists - many of those interviewed said they were from Brazil, Canada and Japan - and plenty of college students looking for deals or at least some good stories for their friends.
"We can go all night - we're in college and we're used to not sleeping," said Maricel Zamoras, 22, a senior at Southern Adventist University in Collegedale, Tenn., which brought students to the city on an eight-day field trip to study the sociology and business of New York. Ms. Zamoras and her friend Jessica Anzai, 20, agreed that shopping on Black Friday provided a hearty taste of both subjects.
"I'm looking to see what I can get that's really good that's also really, really cheap," Ms. Zamoras said. "But if I go home empty-handed that's O.K. too."

 11:07 p.m. | The Hard Core and the Merely Curious 
At 8 p.m. Thursday, as the Times Square Toys "R" Us opened its doors, the line of circular-clutching deal-seekers curled halfway around a city block. The lucky first couple of hundred people in line had been given Santa hats and goodie bags by the store to honor their punctuality and warm their noggins, although the evening temperature was mild.
"We got here early for the iPod and tablets deals," said Shequel Pearce, 39, holding up tickets she was given by Toys "R" Us staff that guaranteed her these items in case stock ran low. Visiting from Nassau in the Bahamas, she and her family arrived at 4:30 p.m. and were near the very front of the line. "We didn't come to New York just to shop, but we're here, so we're gonna shop," she said.
Parents farther back grumbled about how long the line was this year compared with last year, when the store opened at 10 p.m., and others peeled crying children away with a promise that they could visit "tomorrow." Some tourists braved the line just to see what the fuss was about.
"I guess I don't really have any particular goals for tonight's shopping, but it seems less nerve-racking to stand in line here than walking through all of that," said Patrick Tucker, a 24-year-old from Kansas City, motioning to the clogged pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks of Times Square.
Some had been anticipating this sale for months and were in for the long haul.
"We'll probably spend the whole night at Macy's after this," said Iona Rashmi of Manhattan, who said she did the same last year. "I do my shopping for the whole year this night - holidays, birthdays, everything I need to buy for friends and family. The deals are better."
As when Moses parted the Red Sea, once the doors to the building opened, those in line streamed in swiftly. By about 8:30 p.m. or so, there was no line.
Parents reading lists off of scraps of paper or their smartphones clustered around the Avengers gear, Monster High dolls, Barbies, Legos and scooters. There was a separate line within the store to get into the video game section.
Tina Lee of Manhattan lugged around eight gigantic blue mesh Toys "R" Us bags full of toys and gifts, saying she had been tasked by her coworkers to do all their purchasing since they were stuck working Thursday night and Friday.
"It's sad I have to be the one to do it, but at least I have the night off," said Ms. Lee.
Brazilian tourists in particular said they had purposely timed their visit to New York for this long weekend because they had been hearing about this magical American holiday called Black Friday for a couple of years now.
"Tonight I'm going to Old Navy, H&M, Sephora and maybe Apple, but maybe that's tomorrow," said Maria Augusta, 33, of São Paulo, Brazil. She bought a package deal for a flight and hotel for around $3,000 just so she could make her purchases at New York prices. "Everything is so expensive in Brazil. They think we're all millionaires. It is worth it, very worth it, to fly here to shop."

 8:29 p.m. | Hungry for Deals on Thursday 
While some stores made the controversial decision to open on Thanksgiving, consumers were not necessarily buying into the "Black Thursday" rush just yet.
In Midtown Manhattan, a handful of the major chain stores, like Lord & Taylor, Old Navy and Foot Locker, staffed up on Thursday for people who wanted to get an early start. After all, a recent report from the International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs estimated that some 41 million people were expected to take advantage of the increased Thanksgiving hours to shop before or after stuffing their faces with turkey and pie.
As of mid- to late afternoon, though, some of the stores were not especially busy.
On the third floor of Old Navy on West 34th Street around 4 p.m., racks of neatly hung children's fleeces, pants and shirts remained still unmussed by shoppers. In some areas of the store, in fact, the shoppers were nearly outnumbered by polite and cheerful salespeople, who were handing out fliers about Friday's deals beginning at midnight, 4 a.m., and 8 a.m.
Many of the people who were shopping said they did not come in seeking particular deals. Like Luiz and Sayonara Nascimento of Florianopolis, Brazil, or Maxine and Bill Sauber of Carlisle, Penn., they just happened to wander by and decided to browse.
"The door was open and the music was blasting, so we figured why not?" said Ms. Sauber. She said she was looking around for potential gifts for grandchildren but hadn't decided whether to buy anything yet.
Likewise, several people interviewed at Lord & Taylor said they had not planned on doing any major shopping. They decided to come in after spotting people toting Lord & Taylor shopping bags in Bryant Park and around the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade route.
"So far the deals aren't that great," said Rachel Feldman, 20, of Brooklyn, who was browsing the shoe collection because she said she had some time before going to a friend's dinner feast. She bought some chocolates at a shop at Bryant Park, but nothing at Lord & Taylor.
Many shoppers congregated around the boots and pumps on display, but other floors of designer clothes and sportswear had very few people milling around at 5:30, an hour and a half before closing time.
There were at least some customers who came on Thursday because they were not able to shop on Friday.
"You know those other stores are losing money by being closed right now," said Latasha Jones, 46, at Old Navy. She said she finished cooking the night before to give herself time to shop on Thanksgiving since she had work on Friday. "It's an off-day for a lot of people, and it's the only time we can shop."
Once her Thanksgiving dinner in Manhattanville was over, she said, she expected to be back in Midtown for Macy's midnight opening.
"I'm not going to make it out all night," she said. "But I need to get some bargains. With this economy, I need to save money just like everybody else."

HEADLINE: Mary Miller vs. Neil Barofsky for the S.E.C.

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama has the opportunity, in nominating a new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to pick someone committed to change rather than to protecting the biggest banks, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
The Obama administration is floating the idea that Mary J. Miller, under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, could become its nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ms. Miller, a longtime executive in the mutual funds industry, has served in the Treasury under Timothy Geithner since February 2010.
Ms. Miller represents the financial sector's preferred approach to financial reform - some talk but very little by way of serious effort. She has no time for people who are serious about making the financial system safer. And there is no willingness to really face down powerful people on Wall Street.
Her potential candidacy faces three major obstacles: Neil Barofsky, money market funds and the new momentum for reform. 
Mr. Barofsky is the most important obstacle, because as soon as you think about him you see an instantly plausible chairman for the S.E.C. The former special inspector general for the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, he is an experienced prosecutor who understands complex financial fraud. For example, he brought Refco Inc. executives and their legal advisers to justice in the mid-2000s (Refco was a commodities giant where top people engaged in accounting fraud). And he's tough - he took on Colombian drug traffickers early in his career.

Most recently, he confronted Mr. Geithner over how TARP was carried out - pushing for answers on why bailout terms were so favorable for big banks and so unfavorable for everyone else. He also pursued a number of securities fraud cases, including one involving Colonial Bank, which illegally obtained more than half a billion dollars from TARP. Mr. Barofsky's office stopped that fraud in its tracks and eventually obtained one of the few high-level convictions resulting from the financial crisis.
Mr. Barofsky's account is published in his highly readable book, "Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street." Mr. Barofsky understands as much about finance as anyone in the industry, and no one would ever think he was captured by the worldview of big banks.
Mr. Barofsky is a lifelong Democrat who has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress. Since I suggested Mr. Barofsky's name in a post last week, there has been an outpouring of support. A petition that Credo Action has put online urging President Obama to appoint an S.E.C. chairman who will hold Wall Street accountable, and naming Mr. Barofsky as a worthy choice, had more than 35,000 signatures by Wednesday morning. 
The petition also recommends former Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware and Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets - both of whom I endorsed here last week - and it expresses support for Sheila Bair, who would be terrific for the job (in a separate column last week, I said she was one of five people who deserve serious consideration to be Treasury secretary).
The White House does not like to take public suggestions of names for prominent positions; the Washington way is to do everything behind closed doors. And Mr. Barofsky is not popular with Mr. Geithner, precisely because he has stood up to authority for all the right reasons.
"Barofsky is exactly what the S.E.C. needs to restore its tattered reputation as a guardian of the capital markets," said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. 
Still, considering Mr. Barofsky as a potential nominee makes the case for Ms. Miller look very weak.
She has no experience as a regulator or as an enforcer of the law. She has never worked on securities fraud. And she has no track record of standing up to powerful vested interests; in fact, she helped push the recent JOBS Act, which greatly undermines the protections available to investors. In addition, her work experience is entirely within the mutual fund industry - 26 years at T. Rowe Price. And a major agenda item now for the S.E.C. is mutual funds and how to make them less vulnerable to the kind of runs that occurred in September 2008. (For a primer, please see my recent column for Yahoo Finance.)
The mutual fund industry does not want reform, and it worked long and hard to keep Mary Schapiro, the departing S.E.C. chairwoman, from pushing forward some sensible ideas. After outside pressure was brought to bear, including by Ms. Bair's Systemic Risk Council (of which I am a member), there are signs that the S.E.C. will finally at least issue some proposed changes for public comment.
I do not know where Ms. Miller stands on money-market reform; indeed, from her public remarks it is very hard to know precisely where she is on any reform issue. It would be most unfortunate to put her in at the S.E.C. precisely when the mutual fund industry is about to come in for some serious scrutiny. The optics, as they say in Washington, would not be good.
More broadly, there is a new push for financial reform - even from people who are close to Wall Street. In a wave of speeches and other statements (some you have seen and some you will see soon), voices are being raised against the too-big-to-fail approach and related causes of financial fragility. In particular, a speech last month by Daniel K. Tarullo, a governor of the Federal Reserve, seems to have released a great deal of pent-up creative thinking within the official sector.
Size caps for big banks are definitely on the drawing board, at least along the lines that Mr. Tarullo identified, which would limit nondeposit liabilities at any one institution relative to the size of our economy.
Given this momentum for responsible reform, does President Obama really want to appoint a financial services executive - with a nonexistent or weak track record on reform - to a prominent public policy and enforcement position?
As Steven Ramirez has pointed out, Big Finance went all in for Mitt Romney and against Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Elizabeth Warren, elected to the Senate in Massachusetts. This was a comprehensive electoral defeat for Wall Street; whenever its behavior was at stake, people voted for change. And the contributions of the Wall Street community did not seem to produce the outcomes it wanted. 
There is a view in Washington that politicians need Wall Street and its money - to start campaigns, to provide a wall of financing at critical moments and to help create a generous endowment for post-presidential activities. Without a doubt, this has been the pattern in the past.
But in this big country there are many diverse business sectors - and lots of people willing to give money without asking for special-interest favors.
Choosing a new chairman of the S.E.C. is the perfect time for President Obama to decide whether, despite everything, to go for the status quo - which brought us to our current economic predicament - and nominate Ms. Miller for the S.E.C. Or does he really want effective change? In that case, he should nominate Mr. Barofsky or someone who can match his stellar qualifications.

HEADLINE: Books for Those Who Dream of Ancient Wealth

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
Books about antiques made for the ruling classes can stir up pleasant mixtures of craving and schadenfreude. The gift volumes recommended this year have intellectual heft and emotional wallop, explaining how artisans fabricated absurd luxuries that barely survived wars, natural disasters and owners' falls from power.
'THE DREAM OF A KING: DRESDEN'S GREEN VAULT' (Hirmer/ University of Chicago Press, $59.95). Saxon royals in the 17th and 18th centuries drew wealth from mineral mines and then flaunted it with gemstone knickknacks in mirrored palaces. ''The Dream of a King'' is the catalog for an exhibition that opened a year ago of Dresden's loans to the Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar, and was written by half a dozen German scholars. The display in the Middle East suits the multicultural tastes of Augustus II and III, a Saxon father and son who ruled from the 1690s to the 1760s. Their goblets and statuettes depict Africans, American Indians, Roman emperors and camels. The kings had senses of humor too; a pearl figure of one of the regime's costly Swiss bodyguards has a painted motto warning of what would happen if the economy crashed: ''No money, no Swiss.'' During 1770s wartime budget crises countless silver works in the Dresden collection were melted down. In World War II the remaining treasures had been stored away safely by the time air raids reduced the mirrored rooms to shards. 
'EXTRAVAGANT INVENTIONS: THE PRINCELY FURNITURE OF THE ROENTGENS' (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Yale University Press, $75). The Saxons' relatives and enemies throughout 18th-century Europe patronized the Roentgen cabinetmaking workshop near Cologne. ''Extravagant Inventions,'' the catalog for an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum through Jan. 27, is full of custom pieces that the customers barely had time to enjoy. Abraham and David Roentgen, a father-son team, supervised up to 200 workers between the 1740s and 1790s. They inlaid Rococo desks and tables with scenes of colonnades, battlefields and frolicking peasants. They concealed mechanisms that powered pop-up shelves and music boxes, and they striped gilt on squared-off armchairs and clocks that foreshadowed the 19th-century Biedermeier fashion. The book's 11 authors, including curators and conservators, trace centuries of wanderings of pieces made for French and Russian aristocrats who had been killed by revolutionaries and assassins.
'RENAISSANCE INTARSIA: MASTERPIECES OF WOOD INLAY' (Abbeville, $95). ''Renaissance Intarsia'' focuses on work still in situ but suffering from a few bad repairs over the years. The text, by a team of 10 Italian historians, analyzes church and palace walls dating to the 1430s. Traveling carvers executed the wood mosaic cityscapes and pasture scenes, while adding details that flattered the clients. Scholars liked intarsia images of musical instruments and books, and popes and monks ordered portraits of saints. The wood grain lines, dotted with mother-of-pearl, were positioned to represent tiny gleaming swords, bird feathers and draped robes. The raw material, the authors explain quite evocatively, came from trees felled in winter, ''and only during the waning phase of the moon.''
'GREEK AND ROMAN MOSAICS' (Abbeville, $125). Stone mosaic artists in ancient Greece and Rome imported polychrome chips from quarries scattered between Egypt and Asia. ''Greek and Roman Mosaics,'' by the Italian historians Umberto Pappalardo and Rosaria Ciardiello, surveys 3,000-year-old pebble floors with geometric patterns, second-century scenes of chariots at Pompeii and sixth-century biblical tableaus for basilica domes. The book's glossary is entertaining: ancient installers called themselves tessellators, and a favorite squiggly motif was known as ''opus vermiculatum. '' Many of the mosaics have been removed from their original mortar beds; a petaled frame from a Tivoli villa's scene of doves around a birdbath has been cut apart and dispersed among collections in Germany, England and France.
'THE BOOK OF KELLS' (Thames & Hudson, $95). The Book of Kells escaped looters numerous times, but it lost pages, covers and a gold slipcase along the way. Sometime around A.D. 800 Irish monks originally wrote the Gospel excerpts on vellum hides harvested from about 160 calves and painted illustrations with indigo, lichen and gypsum pigments. ''The Book of Kells,'' by the Dublin curator Bernard Meehan, is based on recent research into different scribes' handwriting and occasional typos. In a subchapter titled ''Uncertainties'' Mr. Meehan wonders why some fish in the illuminations have human heads and why some old men are portrayed pulling each other's beards.
'BUDDHA IN THE YURT: BUDDHIST ART FROM MONGOLIA' (Hirmer/University of Chicago, $179). The meanings of Mongolian Buddhist artifacts have become harder to decode since the 1920s, when the country's Soviet-backed Communists started executing monks and seizing temples. An anonymous European private collector commissioned half a dozen scholars to produce a two-volume set about his holdings, ''Buddha in the Yurt.'' Deities and abbots in the paintings and statues can be identified by the styles of their robes, flaming headdresses and hand gestures, holding blood-filled skulls and wish-fulfilling jewels. Gems are missing from metalwork in the collection, and secret compartments in shrines have been emptied. But inside talisman boxes hidden photographs have turned up of Mongolia's last Buddhist leaders, dressed in fine silk and furs.
'THE QUEEN'S DIAMONDS' (Royal Collection Publications/University of Chicago, $95). Photographs of rulers wearing finery have long been popular collectibles; they would reassure subjects that their realm's wealth was somewhere safe. ''The Queen's Diamonds'' is heavily illustrated with images of pieces in use at formal events worldwide. The author, Hugh Roberts, a former director of the Royal Collection, explains how necklaces were shortened and brooches dismantled to suit different queens' tastes. He also recounts a few family scandals. Queen Victoria battled with her German cousins over inherited jewelry, and her granddaughter-in-law, Queen Mary, had to buy back another batch of treasure from a cousin's mistress. The stones themselves represented doomed imperial power; they came from mines in India and Africa staffed by oppressed, rebellious colonists.
'NATURAL HISTORIES: EXTRAORDINARY RARE BOOK SELECTIONS FROM THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY LIBRARY' (Sterling, $50). Europeans' desire for overseas gems had surged as far back as the 16th century, when explorers brought back word of treasures worth exploiting. Royals publicized the discoveries by financing lavish scientific encyclopedias. ''Natural Histories,'' edited by the museum librarian Tom Baione, reproduces excerpts from early scholarship laced with travelogue and hype. Zoologists in the 1500s carved woodblocks of sea monkeys based purely on legend. Jewelers in the 1670s described thrones in India that really were studded with diamonds. The book comes with a portfolio of 40 loose prints, so gift recipients can create their own dreamscapes of mermaids, butterflies, volcanoes and seven-headed hydras.

HEADLINE: Reopening an 18-Year-Old Wound

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran, and Emily Schmall from Buenos Aires.

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES -- Eighteen years have passed since a suicide bomber drove a Renault van loaded with explosives into the headquarters of the Jewish community center here, killing 85 people. Since then, investigations have meandered. Interpol arrest warrants have led nowhere. Aging suspects connected to the attack have begun to die.
But in the elusive quest for justice in the bombing, which ranks among the deadliest anti-Semitic attacks anywhere since World War II, few developments have riled Argentina's Jewish leaders as much as the government's move in recent weeks to improve relations with Iran, the nation shielding in the high echelons of its political establishment various people accused by Argentine prosecutors of having authorized the attack. 
Each country has domestic reasons to reach out to the other. As Argentina's economic growth slows, it is finding in Iran a robust client for its agricultural commodities, with trade volumes between the two nations surging more than 200 percent over the last five years to more than $1.2 billion.
Iran, meanwhile, is seeking to blunt its diplomatic isolation, expanding on the warm ties it has forged with other nations in Latin America, notably Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador.
''We cannot comprehend this,'' said Guillermo Borger, the president of the Argentine Mutual Aid Association, the center that was bombed in 1994. ''The world is shutting its doors to Iran, and we're giving Iran a chance to say that Argentina is somehow now its friend. The Iranians have not budged in their assertion that their people are innocent, so why should Argentina be in dialogue with them?''
The reaction is markedly different in Tehran, where leaders have welcomed Argentina's diplomatic pivot. ''We expect this lawsuit to be dropped, and never raised again,'' said Hamid Reza Taraghi, who heads the international department of the influential Islamic Coalition Party, referring to the investigative case here overseen by prosecutors. ''Such a move will help ease the international pressure on our country.''
Both Argentina's former president, Néstor Kirchner, and his widow, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who succeeded him, offered strong support for the investigations into the bombing. Their approach stood in contrast to that of Carlos Saúl Menem, who was president at the time of the bombing and is formally accused of obstructing the investigation. Mr. Menem, now a senator, has denied the charge.
The investigation was marred by corruption charges, delays and incompetence, but Alberto Nisman, a special prosecutor who took over the case in 2005, seemed to breathe vigor into the case. He accused Hezbollah, the Lebanese group with strong ties to Iran and Syria, of carrying out the bombing, and senior Iranian officials of planning and financing it.
Despite that, Argentina and Iran are re-engaging, informally in September at the United Nations General Assembly in New York and again in formal talks in October in Geneva. Another round of negotiations is scheduled for late November.
Not everyone among Argentina's Jews, Latin America's largest population with about 250,000 people, opposes the talks. In an interview, Sergio Burstein, a supporter of Mrs. Kirchner and the leader of a group representing relatives of victims killed in the bombing, said the negotiations offered a ''flicker of hope'' for the possibility that Iran might hand over suspects to stand trial here.
Just as mystery still shrouds many aspects of the bombing, doubt and secrecy cloak the current talks. Argentina's Foreign Ministry has rejected requests from survivors of the attack and Jewish leaders in Argentina, made through the office of Mr. Nisman, the prosecutor in the bombing investigation, for information on the negotiations.
Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman, who is leading the diplomatic outreach, also declined a separate request for an interview on the talks, which began after Iran repeatedly refused to comply with Argentina's order for international arrest warrants for nine people. Those suspects included a former Iranian president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and Iran's defense minister, Gen. Ahmad Vahidi.
While Argentine and American investigators have long agreed that the suicide bombing was carried out by a militant from Hezbollah, Mr. Nisman, the prosecutor overseeing the case, has contended that the decision to attack AMIA, as the cultural center is known by its Spanish initials, was made at a 1993 meeting in the Iranian city of Mashhad in Mr. Rafsanjani's presence.
Others involved in investigating the attack, including James Bernazzani, a former F.B.I. agent who was head of the bureau's office on Hezbollah, have disputed the explicit link to Iran.
In a telephone interview from the United States, Mr. Bernazzani, who assisted the Argentines in their investigation, criticized their circumstantial cross-referencing of telephone records, without actually having intercepts of those calls, to make the case that Mohsen Rabbani, Iran's cultural attaché in Argentina in 1994, was involved in coordinating the attack.
In addition, Mr. Bernazzani questioned Argentine investigators' use of testimony by an Iranian defector whose reliability has been called into question. ''Although I highly suspect Iranian complicity because of the relationship with Hezbollah, that does not stand up to F.B.I. standards,'' he said. ''We need proof, and what we proved was an individual who was in that van was the son of a leading Hezbollah patriot.''
Of course, Ibrahim Hussein Berro, the 21-year-old Lebanese man identified through DNA analysis as the suicide bomber at the helm of the Renault van, is dead. Another suspect, Samuel Salman El Reda, a Colombian whom Argentine prosecutors accuse of coordinating the Hezbollah cell that carried out the bombing, is thought to be living in Lebanon.
Meanwhile, the Iranians connected to the case seem to be unhindered by the arrest warrants against them. In an October interview from the Iranian city of Qum with a Brazilian newspaper, Mr. Rabbani, Iran's former cultural attaché here, scoffed at Argentina's investigation, proclaiming his innocence. General Vahidi, Iran's defense minister, traveled in 2011 to neighboring Bolivia.
Adriana Reisfeld, the president of Active Memory, a group representing relatives of people killed in the attack, said her expectations were low that the diplomatic overtures with Iran would lead to closure.
''All we want now is to get as close to justice as we can,'' said Ms. Reisfeld, whose sister was killed in the blast. ''We can't let the AMIA case close and be forgotten.''

Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Jean-Michel Othoniel: My Way' (through Dec. 2) Some of the art in this whimsical but cloying midcareer survey can strike you as the sculptural equivalent of haute couture. A bed framed by Murano glass beads is accompanied by veils of tulle, each one hand embroidered with gold thread in a workshop established by Louis XIV. Elsewhere, 4,200 yellow blown-glass bricks, shaped by artisans from Firozabad, India, form a shimmering rectangular solid. Early works in wax, sulfur and obsidian are more personal and provocative, showing the influence of mentors and peers like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Sophie Calle and Annette Messager. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collagelike paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 3) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Jan. 6) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is a big art event in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; Also on display at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Mantegna to Matisse: Master Drawings From the Courtauld Gallery' (through Jan. 27) This show of 58 drawings from a London museum and institute of art history covers a lot of ground -- namely, the Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods. The installation, which spills over from the lower-level galleries into the Cabinet Room off the lobby, encourages much back-and-forth between works of similar subject or virtuosity; Pontormo is paired with Michelangelo, Rubens with Rembrandt, and Goya with Daumier. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Vincent van Gogh's Portrait of a Peasant (Patience Escalier)' (through Jan. 20) ''You'll shortly make the acquaintance of Mr. Patience Escalier -- a sort of man with a hoe, an old Camargue oxherd,'' Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo, from the Provençal city of Arles in 1888. His bracingly vivid portrait the same year of this local character, with his grizzled beard and steely blue eyes offset by a ruddy complexion and bright yellow hat, normally resides at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif. But for the next few months it can be seen at the Frick as part of an exchange program between the two museums. Installed on a temporary wall in the Oval Room, it shocks the neighboring Whistler portraits with its feral gaze and forthright celebration of hard labor. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Gabriel Orozco: Asterisms' (through Jan. 13) For one-half of this two-part exhibition, Mr. Orozco and his team collected about 1,200 pieces of flotsam and jetsam that washed up on the beach of a nature preserve in Mexico. All are displayed by type in a color-coordinated rectangle on the floor along with framed grids of photographs of each item. A playing field on Pier 40 in Manhattan was similarly combed for detritus. The two presentations resemble exhibitions in a natural history museum. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and Bureaucracy of Everyday Life' (through Jan. 6) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help being overwhelming. But it's pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)' (through Jan. 6) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with Japan Society's show giving us a more concentrated view of the style. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'George Bellows' (through Feb. 18) Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, this exhibition starts strong with the lush early paintings of New York City and its residents for which Bellows is justifiably well known. It then devotes more than half its space to a disorganized reprise of his restless but steady artistic decline, which ended with his death in 1925 at 42 from a ruptured appendix. It does little to clarify his achievement, partly because of the short shrift given to his plein air oil studies and late landscape paintings. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (through Jan. 6) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool.

&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art' (through Jan. 13) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)'' at Japan Society -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with the Met's show giving us a broader view of the style. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Extravagant Inventions: The Princely Furniture of the Roentgens' (through Jan. 27) The first in-depth survey of the brilliant artistry and engineering of Abraham and David Roentgen, a father-and-son team of genius German cabinetmakers, features roll-top desks, writing tables, chairs and clocks. Rife with intricate inlay and marquetry, gilded mounts and hidden compartments revealed by the touch of a button, these objects were among the supreme status symbols of late-18th-century Europe. Video animations show seven of the desks in action. The show is, over all, a stealth blockbuster. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years' (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, über-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Durer to de Kooning: 100 Master Drawings From Munich' (through Jan. 6) A few years ago the Morgan lent a cache of drawings to the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich. Now it's payback time, and 100 choice drawings from that venerable German museum are in New York. Mantegna, Michelangelo and Raphael are among the serious marquee names, nicely balanced with cartoon heads by Sigmar Polke. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 686-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Alina Szapocznikow: Sculpture Undone, 1955-1972' (through Jan. 28) This small but intense exhibition is the museum's second show of an Eastern European female artist in less than a year, following the Conceptual performance and photography of ''Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence.'' For many Americans it will be their first look at Ms. Szapocznikow's precocious Pop-Surrealist sculpture, much of which parallels work made on these shores by Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde' (through Feb. 25) Modernist art, insurgent and utopian, ignited like a firecracker cluster in cities across the globe in the early 20th century, and Tokyo was one of them. Rising from the ashes after World War II, it produced huge amounts of new art, feisty, fantastic, often politically subversive. And a wave of it comes surging out at you like a blast of sound -- half noise, half music -- in this surprising exhibition made up of loans from Japan and little-seen material from MoMA's collection. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (through Jan. 7) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine Godé-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos' (through Jan. 20) This elegant, mind-expanding exhibition sidesteps the standard retrospective format and a linear, canonical version of art history. Ms. Trockel emphasizes her recent work in numerous mediums -- most impressively ceramics, photography and drawing, sharing the spotlight with outsider artists, botanical illustrations and zoological models and even natural specimens. The result is completely entrancing, a celebration of nature and also of human nature -- its curiosity, ingenuity and yearning for expression -- encapsulated by the artist's magnanimous vision. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
New-York Historical Society: 'John Rogers: American Stories' (through Feb. 18) The sculptor John Rogers (1829-1904) was the Norman Rockwell of his time. For a few decades following the Civil War, his lively, anecdotal, figurative tableaus known as Rogers Groups sold by the tens of thousands to middle- and upper-middle-class folks for about $15 apiece. Including examples of the technically impressive bronze masters from which the multiples were cast in plaster, this exhibition showcases an artist who was as remarkable for his entrepreneurial savvy as for his idealistic vision of life in America. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (through Feb. 3) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now, at 88, he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- is familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden, and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. An installation of his famous ''blps'' (pronounced blips), abstract lozenge forms, usually black and shaped like the uprights in an exclamation point, is in place on and around the High Line near the site of the Whitney's future home at Gansevoort and Washington Streets. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
Jean Arp: 'A Collection of Wood Reliefs and Collages' (through Dec. 11) Centered on a late print project, this show finds Arp sticking to his early-Modernist vocabulary of floating, biomorphic shapes. The focus is a set of colored-paper collages and a matching series of painted-wood reliefs, the bookends to a 1966 album of woodcuts titled ''Le Soleil Recerclé.'' The show's theme of continuity across mediums is defied, brilliantly, by two late-1950s works in brass; their spiky points show Arp's friendly blobs evolving into something more specific to the material at hand. Blain/Di Donna, 981 Madison Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets, (212) 259-0444, blaindidonna.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; 'Calder: The Complete Bronzes' (through Dec. 8) The ingenious master of spare, levitating modern sculpture in wire, wood and sheet metal turns out to have been almost as adept with the ancient dead-weight staple of bronze, as demonstrated by 35 examples and some dozen plaster models in this eye-opening show. They run the gamut from figurative to abstract; dabble in Surrealism; achieve their own kind of levitation; and delve into art history while enabling the artist to use his hands and amazing tactile sense in a different way. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, (212) 992-7800, isaw.nyu.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Wayne Thiebaud: 'A Retrospective' (through next Friday) This concise survey of the art of Mr. Thiebaud, one of the greatest living American painters, includes a surprising number of objects drawn from his personal holdings and dating from every stage of his six-decade career. Among them are many of the medium-size still lifes of food that made Mr. Thiebaud famous, paintings like 1963's ''Peppermint Counter,'' with its inviting piles of red-and-white candies, as well as singular and surprising works like the small 1967 painting of an American flag hanging from a schoolhouse wall.

&#x2605; Cy Twombly: 'The Last Paintings' and 'A Survey of Photographs, 1954-2011' (through Dec. 22) Side-by-side exhibitions -- one of a series of brash final paintings with thick scrolling, spiraling scrawls in red and yellow on vivid green grounds, the other of overly lush, often sentimental photographs -- offer an admirably complete view of the sensibility of Cy Twombly, who died last year at 83. Together they show the artist as close to his best and unquestionably his worst. Luckily, he spent much more time working with a paintbrush than with a camera.

&#x2605; 'Egon Schiele's Women' (through Dec. 28) New York's most thorough look at Egon Schiele since a 2005 exhibition at the Neue Galerie finds the artist working through a long and impressively varied list of female models, including his mother; a rebellious sister who sometimes posed nude for him; anonymous pregnant women in a maternity hospital; a pair of young prostitutes known as the ''black-haired girls''; his redheaded lover Wally Neuzil; and his strait-laced bourgeois wife, Edith. In an accompanying book, the gallery owner, Jane Kallir, argues persuasively that Schiele, in contrast to contemporaries like Gustav Klimt, ''did not judge his women; he merely observed.''

Olafur Eliasson: 'Volcanoes and Shelters' (through Dec. 22) For his seventh exhibition at this gallery, Olafur Eliasson, the Icelandic-Danish artist known for perception-altering environments, mostly pays a refreshingly back-to-basics homage to Iceland's natural wonders. Photographs of its many volcanoes and hot springs and the isolated huts and cottages built for the enjoyment of them culminate in a gorgeous Richard Long-like floor piece made of chunks of obsidian, or volcanic glass. The strobe-lighted miniature fountains sequestered in a darkened gallery seem superfluous. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Bruce Onobrakpeya: 'Jewels of Nomadic Images' (through Dec. 1) The Nigerian artist Bruce Onobrakpeya turned 80 in August. Tributes have abounded in his home country where, in 2010 he was the second recipient of the Nigerian government's Creativity Award, following Chinua Achebe. The National Gallery of Art in Lagos has mounted a retrospective in his honor, with an impressive catalog. Here in New York there's a more modest but wide-ranging birthday celebration in this sampling of the polymath artist's recent work in printmaking, sculpture and installation.

&#x2605; Diana Thater: 'Chernobyl' (through Dec. 22) In this four-walled video projection, the viewer is immersed in layered, shifting images of the decaying buildings, rusting rubble and overgrown fields in and around Prypiat, a Ukrainian city built in the early 1970s for workers at the Chernobyl reactor and hastily abandoned after the reactor's nuclear meltdown in 1986. The results are not as disturbing as they should be: man-made disaster replayed as lyrical video spectacle is an overly familiar art-world convention by now.

Bernadette Corporation: '2000 Wasted Years' (through Dec. 16) A Warholian spoof of branding, publicity and media, this retrospective of the influential collaborative known as the Bernadette Corporation is depressingly arch. Resembling an ultra-hip design and fashion firm's showroom, the installation includes mannequins in avant-garde clothes; videos of runway shows; scarves and other accessories produced by the Bernadette Corporation; conceptually pointed publications; and a trailer for a documentary about the riots during the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa with commentary by the actress Chloë Sevigny.

Guillermo Kuitca: 'Diarios,' José Antonio Suárez Londoño: 'The Yearbooks,' and 'In Deed: Certificates of Authenticity in Art' (through Dec. 16) Closed for a year for an upgrade, this venerable SoHo institution now has three galleries under one roof and an inaugural show in each of them, including the first New York museum-style exhibition of the Argentine painter Guillermo Kuitca, a small survey of illustrational drawings by José Antonio Suárez Londoño of Colombia, and a smart and amusing selection of artist-made professional contracts.

'The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
&#x2605; Penny Slinger: 'An Exorcism Revisited' (through next Friday) Born in England, Penny Slinger emerged from art school in 1969, a time when lots of liberations were under way, including the nascent women's movement. The earliest works in her first New York solo are six short films from that year. They're student pieces, but pretty out there for the time. The main piece is her still unpublished book of photo-collages and texts called ''An Exorcism.'' A blend of ''Rebecca'' and ''Story of O,'' it's yet another reminder of the adventure that feminist art in the 1960s and '70s was.

Toxic Beauty: 'The Art of Frank Moore' (through Dec. 8) This lavishly detailed retrospective pays tribute to a multifaceted career in painting, set design, film and political activism that was cut short by AIDS in 2002, when the artist was 48. In a time -- the 1980s and '90s -- when some artists re-embraced representational painting and others tackled thorny political topics, Moore did both, and with unusual flair, reviving and revising a panoply of outré realist styles in luminous allegorical canvases that comment on, and link, environmental degradation and the tragedy of AIDS.

Public Art
'Common Ground' (through next Friday) On a site known in the 17th century as the Commons -- which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street -- this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay's group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy's ''Daddies Ketchup'' (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset's aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the ''people's microphone.'' City Hall Park, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; Tatzu Nishi: 'Discovering Columbus' (through Dec. 2) In his first commission in the United States, a Japanese artist known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks around the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them, takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, at Broadway and Central Park South. Free tickets available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor. (Smith)
Last Chance
&#x2605; Gerard Byrne: 'Why It's Time for Imperial, Again' (closes on Sunday) ''Why It's Time for Imperial, Again'' is a brilliant, funny and prescient seven-minute video. It dramatizes an oddly stilted conversation between a car salesman promoting Chrysler's new Imperial and a potential customer, each played by remarkably wooden actors against a shifting background of industrial decrepitude. The script is from a 1980 dialogue between Lee Iacocca, then the chairman of Chrysler, and Frank Sinatra published as an advertising supplement in National Geographic magazine. It sounds like a David Mamet play. Itinerant Protocinema, 31 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (917) 660-7332, protocinema.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'A Disagreeable Object' (closes on Monday) This group show uses a phrase from Giacometti to lend some context to a present in which casual attitudes toward sculpture have become commonplace and plenty of value -- material and otherwise -- is attached to objects without pedestals. The main point here is a new-old one: what looks like cheerful insouciance about the art object is actually a deadly serious reaction to the vagaries of war, technology and the economy. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; 'Duchamp Brothers & Sister': 'Works of Art' (closes on Friday) Two of Marcel Duchamp's brothers, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, were artists, as was his sister, Suzanne. And all four siblings look intriguing, in quite different ways, in this chamber quartet of an exhibition based on one that Marcel himself organized in Manhattan a half-century ago. Francis M.

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: 'EGON SCHIELE'S WOMEN': (through Dec. 28) New York's most thorough look at Egon Schiele since a 2005 exhibition at the Neue Galerie finds this artist working through an impressively varied list of female models, including his mother
a rebellious sister who sometimes posed nude for him
anonymous pregnant women in a maternity hospital
prostitutes known as the ''black-haired girls''
his redheaded lover, Wally Neuzil
and his strait-laced bourgeois wife, Edith. (''Reclining Woman With Green Stockings,'' above, from 1917, is among the works here.) In an accompanying book, the gallery owner, Jane Kallir, argues persuasively that Schiele, in contrast to contemporaries like Gustav Klimt, ''did not judge his women
 he merely observed.'' Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-6734, gseart.com. (Karen Rosenberg) (PHOTOGRAPH BY PRIVATE COLLECTION, GALERIE ST. ETIENNE, N.Y.)

HEADLINE: Effort to Curb Dangerous Coolant Falters, Sometimes at Home

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL and ANDREW W. LEHREN

 BODY:
When Mark Spector's central air-conditioning system stopped cooling his Trumbull, Conn., home this summer, he sent an S O S to his repairman. What happened next illustrates the myriad challenges the United States faces as it tries to phase out the popular but environmentally devastating cooling gas that was in Mr. Spector's unit.
The Environmental Protection Agency has tried to reduce use of this gas, HCFC-22, which depletes the ozone layer and contributes to global warming, by imposing strict quotas on its production. Since 2010, it has also banned the sale of new air-conditioning units containing the compound, and has promoted recycling of the gas from old machines so it will not be released.
But what followed at Mr. Spector's home circumvented all the agency's rules and good intentions: Instead of finding and repairing the hole in his aging unit, a complicated task, a serviceman pumped in more coolant, which leaked out by the next day. When Mr. Spector called around for another solution, a salesman offered to swap in a new condenser unit, but one that still used HCFC-22 -- meaning one more American home would continue relying on an environmentally damaging coolant for years. 
HCFC-22 is being phased out of air conditioners worldwide under an international treaty called the Montreal Protocol, and the United States has aggressively pressed poor countries to pick up the pace. But the United States has yet to put its own house in order. And, with 140 million central air units still running on HCFC-22 in this country, it is a major offender.
Leaks abound in working equipment. Coolant seeps out of discarded equipment in landfills. Regulatory loopholes allow manufacturers to sell parts that rely on HCFC-22, so systems using the old gas can be refurbished rather than replaced. There is almost no reclamation of the gas from old machines for recycling. The E.P.A. is behind schedule in imposing rules to ratchet down domestic production, and smuggling is rarely detected. Even where there are regulations -- for example, repair technicians are legally bound to collect old gas rather than vent it -- there is little enforcement.
And, as Mr. Spector discovered, many of the environmental crimes and misdeeds that keep the country dependent on HCFC-22 happen on your property, most likely without your knowledge.
''It's totally illegal to vent gas, but it's also totally inconspicuous,'' said Stephen O. Andersen, a former E.P.A. official who has campaigned for better controls on cooling gases. ''I always watch like a hawk when they're in my yard,'' he said of technicians.
The concentration of HCFC-22 in the atmosphere is 218 parts per trillion, more than double the amount two decades ago, and it gets there in a number of ways. Low-quality or old equipment leaks, and detecting the colorless and odorless gas without pressure-testing devices is difficult. Sometimes the release is intentional, because it costs less. For example, installing a new part properly usually requires first siphoning a machine's coolant into a canister, for later replacement. But it is quicker, though illegal, just to cut the line. A technician saves half an hour on a job, and the customer gets a smaller bill.
Bobby Ring, who runs a servicing company in suburban New Jersey, said that makes it hard for him to compete. ''There are contractors out there who refuse to make the investment in recovery equipment to reclaim or recover refrigerants, and no one is looking, so -- phsssst -- they let the refrigerant escape,'' he said.
Although large companies, which are required to report use of the gas, have been fined for large leaks, the E.P.A. has never prosecuted a residential service company for intentionally releasing HCFC-22.
Asked about the lack of backyard enforcement, David Bloomgren, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said it is ''a challenge to locate or obtain evidence of illegal venting,'' so the agency focused on large polluters but encouraged homeowners to report possible backyard violations they observed to an E.P.A. tip site at epa.gov/tips/.
While it is hard to quantify exactly how much coolant is illegally released from America's residential air conditioners, the E.P.A. estimates that only 7 percent of used coolant is turned in for recycling.
''The vast majority of it hits the sky,'' illegally vented, said Kevin Zugibe, chief executive of Hudson Technologies Inc., a company set up to recycle HCFC-22. Under the Montreal Protocol, the United States has until 2015 to cut production and imports of newly made HCFC-22 to 10 percent of what it was a decade ago.
Without a much better supply of recycled HCFC-22, the United States will not be able to do that -- or have enough to service all the older air conditioners, grocery store freezers and other refrigeration equipment.
In the European Union, only recycled or reclaimed HCFC-22 can be legally used to service equipment. In Australia and Japan, recovery of the gas from old appliances is mandatory, and technicians receive a fee for collection.
But the E.P.A. has no plans to enact requirements or incentives for recycling in the near future, preferring to rely on market pressures, Mr. Bloomgren said. In January, the E.P.A. proposed more specific limits on domestic production for the coolant, in the hope that curtailing supply would force ''more recovery and reuse of HCFC-22 in large systems, as well as encourage transition to HCFC-22 alternatives.'' It said those rules would be in place by May, but they still are not.
But with weak incentives, repair technicians say, it seems a waste of time to collect the gas, and some distributors even charge extra to those who do the right thing and bring it back for recycling.
The E.P.A. has tried to address overuse of the gas by regulating air-conditioning equipment, forbidding the sale of new machines containing the gas starting in 2010.
Initially, when the rules were proposed months earlier, manufacturers responded by introducing systems that ran on more environmentally friendly -- if costlier -- gases; they struck old models from catalogs. But at the last minute and in the face of a recession, the E.P.A. publicized that it would allow owners of older systems to replace any and all parts so long as the new parts did not contain the coolant.
Unfortunately, as Mr. Spector discovered this summer, that created a loophole that subverted the mandate: Manufacturers could sell condenser units -- the major component of every air-conditioning system -- that were empty of coolant gas. Then, after installation, a worker could simply add new HCFC-22, complying with the letter if not the spirit of the law.
Advertisements and sales personnel even promoted the practice as a way to obtain what is essentially a new central air-conditioning system at a fraction of the cost. A replacement compressor for an old HCFC-22 system costs about $1,200 to $1,500, while a new system using a more environmentally friendly gas costs at least three times as much.
''It's probably legal since you could claim it's just servicing, but it's ethically disturbing and not fair to companies who've spent a lot to develop new products,'' said Dr. Andersen, who is the director of research at the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development.
Though some manufacturers initially cried foul and resisted the practice, they realized they could not afford to do so, said John Mandyck, vice president of Carrier, the cooling and heating systems company. During the past year, an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent of all sales in the United States to replace failed units have been for HCFC-22 condensers.
In the end, Mr. Spector bought an entirely new system, running on R-410A, the gas that has been used in almost all new machines in the United States since 2010 and is far more energy-efficient and better for the ozone layer.
But it is still a potent agent of global warming and, therefore, in a class of chemicals that experts say must ultimately be phased out, too. The problem is that the next generation of cooling gases are all at least mildly flammable, and the E.P.A. is still reviewing their safety in home use, with a first approval possible as early as next year -- not soon enough to help Mr. Spector.
Chilling Effect: Articles in this series describe the impact of the rising demand for coolant gases, a growing contributor to global warming.

(PHOTOGRAPH BY MARCUS YAM FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)(A22) GRAPHICS: What to Know About Your Air-Conditioning: Most residential air-conditioning units, central or window, still rely on HCFC-22, a gas that the Environmental Protection Agency banned in new equipment in 2010 because of its ozone-depleting and global-warming potential. New systems are required to use a more environmentally friendly gas, typically R-410A. But the industry has found ways to keep using the older cooling gas. (A22)

HEADLINE: Agnes Denes: 'Sculptures of the Mind: 1968 to Now'

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Leslie Tonkonow
535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea
Through Jan. 19
By the mid-1960s it seemed that there was no room for consequential innovation in painting and sculpture. So some artists, like Robert Smithson and Michael Heizer, ventured outward to create sculptures in remote places, and some went inward to explore landscapes of the mind. Agnes Denes went both ways. 
In the show ''Sculptures of the Mind: 1968 to Now'' a piece from 1969 called ''The Debate (1 Million B.C. -- 1 Million A.D.)'' sets the terms of mortality and infinity that bookend Ms. Denes's expansive concerns. It has two miniature, seated human skeletons in a clear box whose mirror-coated interior panels create an endless recession of reflections
A 1984 lithograph called ''Dialectic Triangulation: A Visual Philosophy'' diagrams in finely drawn graphics an exploration of symbolic logic that Ms. Denes developed around 1970. Viewers not trained in the more technical aspects of modern philosophy may find it impossible to parse, but it does indicate a remarkable will to achieve systematic understanding of how we think and behave.
More readily comprehensible but existing now only in documentary photographs was Ms. Denes's creation of a two-acre wheat field on landfill near the World Trade Center in 1982. Still alive and growing, on the other hand, is ''Tree Mountain'' (1992-96) in Finland, a conical hill planted with 11,000 fir trees in a complex spiral pattern.
A gallery exhibition can only suggest how far and wide the polymathic Ms. Denes has ranged over material and mental worlds during the past four decades. It would take a full-scale museum retrospective to do that.

HEADLINE: And on Your Left, Behind Those Walls, Lobbyists Are at Work

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Chris Cottrell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The sold-out walking tour began along the Spree River here, within sight of the Reichstag's glass dome. But the group would not visit the historic Parliament building, Checkpoint Charlie or the Brandenburg Gate. About 30 people assembled instead to spend a gray Saturday afternoon in November standing outside office buildings in a cold drizzle.
They were there to follow Timo Lange, 30, dressed all in black, with a hint of stubble on his chin, to learn how influence peddlers ply their trade in the German capital. Mr. Lange is a campaigner for the nonprofit group LobbyControl, which began giving the tours in 2009, to unexpected success for such a seemingly wonky subject.
This year the group has given 144 tours for about 3,400 participants, who pay around $13 (half price for students). The tour's success reflects an electorate that, by American standards, has a low tolerance for money in politics. 
''The problem is the linkage between economic power and political power,'' said Daniela Haug, 49, a commercial producer and photographer who joined several friends for the crash course on how interest groups, businesses and trade associations try to affect policy. ''You see things differently, and you can make decisions better yourself, when you experience it firsthand.''
In front of the unassuming dark brick building that is the home to offices of the German Brewers Federation, Mr. Lange explained how that group hosted parties and flattered politicians. He held up a photograph of a conservative Bavarian politician, Ilse Aigner, the group's ''ambassador of German beer'' for 2009, as well as one of a prominent Social Democrat, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was given the same designation in 2008.
''Him?'' an older woman asked with more than a hint of surprise, as she grasped the tour's first lesson: lobbying is not a game for any single party or for half of the political spectrum. Another example Mr. Lange offered: the leader of the cigarette lobby in Germany was, until last month, a former Green Party member of Parliament who does not smoke.
Mr. Lange regaled the tour group with war stories. After a series of high-profile cases of alcohol poisoning among teenagers, the brewers teamed up with broadcasters and soccer teams to derail a drive for restrictions on the sale and advertising of beer. At the next stop, he gestured at a plaque for the German Chemical Industry Association as he detailed how the chemical industry worked overtime to soften new European regulations on its products.
And then there was the Initiative for a New Social Market Economy, which paid for a soap opera to use scripts portraying unpopular labor market changes more favorably, Mr. Lange said. That backfired when the move became public.
''We are very thin-skinned when it comes to any form of propaganda,'' Claas Lorenz, 25, a student on the tour, said in a succinct reference to Germany's Nazi history. ''We had very bad experiences with it in our past.''
Andrea Römmele, a professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, said: ''Money in campaigns in the United States is freedom of speech; it's seen as a way of expressing oneself. In Germany, giving money in politics is always seen as trying to buy access.''
Chancellor Angela Merkel's leading political challenger, former Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück, suffered a significant setback last month when it was revealed that he had made about $1.6 million from speaking fees in three years.
German attitudes toward politics and money help explain the enduring appeal of Ms. Merkel, who still lives in the apartment she got before she became chancellor, and who hikes on vacation. ''Merkel is so beloved for her sober, unglamorous style of governing,'' said Frank Decker, a professor of political science at the University of Bonn. ''With her, you would never imagine that she might use politics to become rich.''
Germany is 10 months away from the parliamentary election that will determine whether Ms. Merkel wins a third term and her party, the Christian Democratic Union, maintains its grip on the Bundestag. Yet nothing awaits Germans like the multibillion-dollar orgy of political fund-raising and the mind-numbing barrage of television advertisements that tormented swing-state voters in the United States.
The Christian Democrats spent a combined total of just $112 million during the 2009 election year, which included the races for all 598 seats in the federal Parliament and elections for six state Parliaments, as well as regional and municipal votes.
German voters will have a few weeks of debates and campaign rallies. Lampposts will carry demure and even rather old-fashioned posters with little more than the names and faces of local politicians and their party affiliations. Free television advertisements will run on publicly financed stations.
''You could pay for advertising on other networks, and I think it's occasionally done,'' said Karl-Heinz Nassmacher, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Oldenburg, ''but this is a Pandora's box, and the parties refrain from opening it. So TV advertising is basically free of charge.''
It is not that the laws are stricter here than in the United States; in many cases, they are looser. Businesses can give unlimited contributions directly to political parties, as can private individuals. Donations below 10,000 euros, or about $13,000, are not reported.
The difference is largely cultural. Germans dislike costly campaigns and rampant fund-raising, and the parties have seen what happens to those too cozy with donors.
The pro-business Free Democrats had their greatest postwar showing in 2009, winning 14.6 percent of the vote in federal elections and becoming the junior partner in a coalition government. The party pushed for a reduction in the sales tax for hotels, but when news emerged that the Free Democrats had received about $1.4 million in contributions connected to a hotel chain, their popularity plunged. The party failed to reach even the 5 percent threshold for representation in several state Parliaments.
''Germans believe more strongly in social justice and not just servicing your clientele,'' said André Ringel, 42, a graphic designer on the tour.
Mr. Lange taught tourgoers translations of English expressions like ''door opener'' (''türöffner''), for the connected former politicians who can easily arrange meetings. Some terms were not translated, like ''AstroTurf,'' for a fake grass-roots movement or campaign. ''Lobbyist'' works in both languages.
The rain fell harder, and umbrellas came out, but participants stuck it out. For those wishing to make the rounds in the coming off-season, LobbyControl sells a guidebook called ''LobbyPlanet Berlin, the Travel Guide Through the Lobby Jungle,'' which bears more than a passing resemblance to the Lonely Planet guides. The group, which has offices in Berlin and Cologne, produced a second edition for touring Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union.
The tour stopped in front of Café Einstein, a famous meeting place for politicians that Mr. Lange said was ''too open'' for effective lobbying. ''You have journalists at the neighboring table,'' he said.
Instead, he led the group down the avenue and through a passageway to a red carpet leading to an elevator door marked with the emblem of the China Club, a members-only establishment where politicians can meet with lobbyists without worrying about who might be seated at the next table.
''There's an underground garage entrance if you don't want to be seen at all,'' Mr. Lange said.

HEADLINE: As BMW Is Put to the Test, Its Plans Are Years Ahead

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
MUNICH -- In 1987, a recent engineering graduate named Norbert Reithofer wrote a treatise that in retrospect reads like a manifesto for the German economy. The only way manufacturers in a high-cost country with few natural resources could survive, he argued, was by becoming the most flexible and efficient in the world.
Mr. Reithofer, now 56 and chief executive of the automaker BMW, has since put that principle to work with a vengeance, delivering consistent profit through two crises and becoming something of an icon of the revival of German industry.
Though continuing to build roughly 60 percent of its vehicles in high-cost Germany, BMW reported another rise in quarterly profits this month despite the worst downturn the European car industry has had in decades. 
As the auto crisis shows signs of spreading to the premium market, though, Mr. Reithofer faces a test of his management skills that will have implications for the whole nation. Cars are Germany's largest export product. But the losses that companies like Fiat, Ford and General Motors have been piling up in the region raise fundamental doubts about the future of automobile manufacturing in Western Europe.
Moreover, deep changes are under way that threaten to reshuffle the pecking order among carmakers, or even create openings for upstarts.
The price of fuel, already close to the equivalent of $8 a gallon for premium gasoline in Germany, is only likely to rise in coming decades, forcing automakers to think about other means of propulsion. Governments are tightening fuel economy and emissions standards to the point where it will be difficult to manufacture the big luxury cars that have the highest profit margins.
And young people are increasingly apathetic about cars, which must compete with mobile phones and video games for their attention and money. BMW's third-quarter earnings, along with recent reports by rivals Mercedes-Benz and Audi, show that the high-end carmakers are beginning to feel the effects of the crisis. While BMW managed to eke out a sales increase in Europe during the third quarter, it reported marked declines in troubled countries like Spain, where BMW sales have fallen by half since 2007.
''The next two years will be a real challenge, there is no glossing that over,'' Mr. Reithofer said during an interview at BMW's headquarters in Munich, a high-rise building shaped like four cylinders that, from the upper stories, has a clear view of the Bavarian Alps.
The ebullient Mr. Reithofer, whose default facial expression is a self-assured smile, betrayed no hint of anxiety, though. Instead, he told a story about the three years, from 1997 to 2000, that he spent overseeing BMW's factory in Spartanburg, S.C.
Soon after arriving, Mr. Reithofer recalled, he presented managers there with a list of problems. They corrected him. ''Norbert,'' they said, according to Mr. Reithofer, ''here in the United States we don't have problems. We have challenges. And every challenge is an opportunity.''
That expression of American can-do spirit ''left a deep, deep impression on me,'' he said. An aide says that Mr. Reithofer tells this story at least once a week.
Thus, BMW is treating the crisis as an opportunity to expand its market share. The company is accelerating spending on research and development and sticking to the timetable for next year's introduction of a battery-powered car with a lightweight carbon-fiber body. BMW is building a new factory in Brazil and expanding production of its Mini brand in Britain.
If the company begins to feel the effects of the economy's slowdown, it has agreements with workers that will let it cut production quickly, as it did in 2008.
Mr. Reithofer is also positioning the company for big shifts in the industry years from now. Chris Bangle, former chief of design at BMW and now head of his own design firm based in a small town in northern Italy, argues that the industry must worry about the decline in what he calls ''its lifeblood -- customers who grow up caring about cars.''
''Any look into the stats on issuance of drivers licenses and involvement in cars by the youth in U.S.A., Japan, and Europe shows this,'' Mr. Bangle said in an e-mail.
Expectations for Mr. Reithofer are high because BMW is one of the few automakers to have made a profit ever year since the financial crisis began in 2008. Warned in late 2007 by a BMW dealer in the United States that the subprime crisis was beginning to hurt sales, Mr. Reithofer returned to Germany and persuaded the company's board of management to cut production even though evidence of a downturn was only anecdotal.
''That was a very turbulent board meeting,'' Mr. Reithofer said.
Rainer Feurer, BMW's head of strategy, said that the episode demonstrated that, while Mr. Reithofer preferred to take a methodical, analytical approach, ''he is ready to make risky decisions.''
Mr. Reithofer said that one lesson he learned from the downturn in 2009 was that it paid to continue investing in future growth. Even as BMW cut production back then, it expanded its factory in South Carolina and added a second factory in China. It paid off. The company continues to post phenomenal sales growth in China, including a 39 percent increase in the third quarter. The growth in American sales has been more modest, rising about 1 percent in the third quarter. During the current crisis, BMW is similarly increasing spending on research and development -- by 15 percent so far this year, to about 3 billion euros ($3.8 billon) -- as it pursues one of the most radical initiatives by a major carmaker anywhere.
Next year, BMW plans to introduce a battery-powered car with a body made primarily of carbon fiber and aluminum. Those materials are lighter than steel but much more costly to deploy in a mass-produced car.
The effort, known as the I Project, is especially risky given that sales of electric cars like the Nissan Leaf have been disappointing so far. But Mr. Reithofer said he saw the so-called i3, a four-seat city car that will be built in Leipzig, Germany, as a way of preparing the company for long-term changes in the industry. BMW has not yet named a price for the four-seat i3, but analysts say it is likely to be close to $50,000. That is about $20,000 more than the battery-powered Nissan Leaf, but BMW is betting that high-end buyers will be willing to pay more for the i3's unique design and sporty performance. He worries that carmakers could be blindsided by a technology shift, which has happened so often in the computer and software industries. ''I have to get the message across to the organization: people, things are changing!'' Mr. Reithofer said.
Paul Nieuwenhuis, a director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, said that BMW was one of the few companies with enough extra cash to pursue an ambitious project.
''They are future-proofing the company,'' Mr. Nieuwenhuis said. ''The electric vehicles are not going to take off in one or two years. This is not how it works. But when they do take off, you're in trouble if you're not there.''
BMW may be able to take a more long-term view because it is essentially a family-owned company, somewhat immune from the demands of fund managers and bank analysts focused on short-term profit. About 47 percent of BMW shares are owned by the widow and children of Herbert W. Quandt, who acquired a majority in BMW in 1960 when it was close to bankruptcy, and oversaw its revival.
Mr. Reithofer in many ways personifies the German ideal of a manager. He is an engineer in a country that reveres that profession. He grew up in a Bavarian village south of Munich where his father was a factory worker.
Mr. Reithofer joined BMW in 1987 shortly after writing his thesis on manufacturing, part of his doctoral work at the Technical University of Munich. He required only 13 years to rise to the executive board, the top level of management, which he joined in 2000 as head of production. He became chief executive in 2006.
Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany and well-known industry analyst, describes Mr. Reithofer as ''bodenständig'' -- down to earth.
When Mr. Reithofer spoke at a conference that Mr. Dudenhöffer organized, he arrived an hour early and without an entourage, which is not true of all German auto executives, Mr. Dudenhöffer said.
Improbably, BMW still builds cars at a complex adjacent to the company headquarters not far from downtown Munich. The neighborhood was rural when BMW first began producing motors at the site in 1922, but the city has long since engulfed it.
The proximity of the factory puts Mr. Reithofer almost next to the beating heart of the company. Just below the BMW executive offices is a building that houses a giant press, which rhythmically stamps out side panels and other pieces of 3 Series cars, the company's best-selling model. Despite heavy soundproofing, the building emits a steady, bass throbbing sound.
Mr. Reithofer is not far from his customers, either. He can look down from the executive offices and see people taking delivery of new cars at BMW Welt -- BMW World -- the haute design structure where the company showcases all its auto brands, from Rolls-Royce to Husqvarna motorcycles. The company's main development center is also nearby.
A bean counter would probably advise BMW to move the factory elsewhere and sell the real estate. But it is company doctrine that executives, designers and engineers should never be far from the factory floor.
''If you can't build in a place, then you can't innovate there either,'' Mr. Reithofer said.

HEADLINE: Downgrade Of France Entangles Euro Funds

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- France's loss of its prime debt rating from Moody's Investors Service this week poses a challenge for the euro zone's bailout funds, which now face their own potential downgrades and higher borrowing costs as a result.
Moody's on Monday cut its rating on French long-term sovereign debt by a single notch, from AAA to Aa1. The move had been largely expected, because of a similar decision in January by Standard & Poor's and continuing economic stagnation. Markets greeted the news with a yawn. 
But the European Financial Stability Facility, the euro zone's temporary bailout fund, and its permanent replacement, the European Stability Mechanism, still enjoy AAA ratings at Moody's -- even though France, which has the second-largest economy among the 17 European Union members that use the euro, is responsible for more bailout guarantees than any other member except Germany.
Many analysts say it is just a matter of time before Moody's downgrades the bailout funds in turn, which could force them to pay more for their borrowing.
''We believe that a downgrade of the E.F.S.F. is coming in the next few days,'' said Michael Leister, interest rate strategist at Commerzbank in London. ''It was a surprise that it didn't happen mechanically, at the same time as France.''
The bailout funds are crucial to fixing Europe's sovereign debt problems. They have committed tens of billions of euros to Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The funds will also be part of a forthcoming recapitalization of the ailing Spanish banking sector, if not of a wider rescue of the country. Cyprus, too, is close to signing a bailout agreement.
In theory, credit ratings should reflect the risk that a lender will not be repaid, and are thus inversely related to the interest rate the lender demands to hold a debt. But with the global financial system fragile and central banks holding rates down, that relationship has been strained. Both France and the United States, which lost its AAA rating at Standard & Poor's in 2011, continue to borrow near record low levels.
Moody's warned in July that the outlook for the stability fund was negative, and that it might downgrade the fund if there were ''a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the participating euro area member states,'' including France.
Jessica Eddens, a spokeswoman for Moody's, confirmed Thursday by e-mail that the stability fund and the stability mechanism still had AAA ratings, with a negative outlook.
''Moody's will assess the implications of the downgrade of the French government's rating for the E.F.S.F.'s and E.S.M.'s ratings as a matter of course,'' she said, ''focusing in particular on whether the support available from the remaining AAA guarantors and shareholders is consistent with the E.F.S.F. and E.S.M. retaining the highest ratings.''
For the moment, the Moody's downgrade of France is complicating matters for the stability fund, which has had to suspend its financing plans while officials work through the implications of the French downgrade.
The fund had been preparing to sell three-year bonds, for which it said there was solid investor demand. But its rules require that new bond issues must be fully guaranteed by euro zone member states with better ratings than the stability fund. The fund has now halted that planned offering, at least temporarily.
The stability fund ''is currently unable to proceed until this technical aspect is resolved,'' Christophe Frankel, its chief financial officer, said in a statement. He noted that the fund's issuance of short-term bills had not been affected, as France's short-term ratings have not changed.
The solution to the problem? Just wait.
Mr. Leister noted that once the stability fund's credit rating had been cut, it would be at or below the French level and, under the fund's rules, would once more be able to issue debt -- a rare case where an issuer hopes to be downgraded.
Wolfgang Proissl, a spokesman for the fund, declined to comment on the potential for a downgrade and how that would affect its actions.
Mr. Leister predicted that the impact on borrowing costs would be limited, as investors are prepared for the inevitable. ''Yields on E.F.S.F. debt will go up,'' he said, ''but there's not going to be a huge spike.''

HEADLINE: Opportunity Missed in U.S. Bailout?

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
LONDON -- Sometimes, the aftermath is more devastating than the storm. That is the story of the 2008 financial crisis. It was disastrous at the time, but what has been worse is how long it has lingered. That halting recuperation is why the global economic meltdown is still at the center of the political debate in the Western world.
Much of the discussion is a replay of the familiar battle between the economists John Keynes and Friedrich Hayek: Is the solution stimulus or austerity? Amir Sufi, a professor at the University of Chicago Business School, has been doing provocative research that suggests we should be focusing on a different angle. 
The real issue, in Mr. Sufi's view, is where stimulus dollars should be targeted.
He believes the U.S. government made a costly mistake by focusing on bankers and not homeowners. Mr. Sufi's argument matters, and not just because there will, inevitably, be another financial crisis. He thinks the intellectual bias that prompted the bailout of Wall Street but not Main Street risks derailing Europe's recovery, too.
''In my view, excessive levels of household debt were the reason the recession was so severe,'' Mr. Sufi told me, speaking by phone from Chicago. ''If you look at the spending decline that drove the great recession, that was coming from the households.''
When their mortgages went underwater, Americans stopped buying, and the rest of the economy, which had been driven by consumer spending, sputtered, too. ''Households, especially at the bottom, are very sensitive to house prices,'' he said. ''In 2008 and 2009, they drove the recession. We basically missed the boat.''
Mr. Sufi's thesis helps to explain one of the mysteries of the U.S. economy today. As a report published this month by Bain Capital explains, money is cheap and plentiful. Titled ''A World Awash in Money,'' the Bain analysis argues that one of the defining realities of this decade will be a global ''capital glut.'' Bain predicts the global capital pool will swell to nearly $1 quadrillion by the end of this decade, creating an ocean of ''capital superabundance'' 10 times greater than the world's underlying gross domestic product.
Here's the puzzle: With so much money sloshing around, why is the recovery so lackluster? In Mr. Sufi's view, one reason is that not everyone is able to dip into this overflowing capital pool. As he explained in a recent paper: ''It could be that there's a 55-year-old household that had their house price drop by 40 percent and they therefore have no net worth available to them. They were planning on drawing down home equity for retirement, and they find themselves underwater, and they cut back on consumption and they save like crazy. If this describes the world, policy could support the banks with infinite resources and it's not going to lead to any additional spending by levered households.''
Income inequality is central to this story: The financial crisis has hit poorest households hardest. Mr. Sufi has found that the households in the 90th percentile of net worth distribution have seen almost no decline in their wealth. Meanwhile, households in the middle and at the 25th percentile have experienced ''a dramatic reduction in net worth.'' That's because financial assets, which have rebounded strongly, are overwhelmingly owned by households in the 90th percentile. If households in the median and at the 25th percentile have any assets at all, ''it's basically housing assets.''
As Mr. Sufi points out, ''given the strong recovery in financial asset prices, but the languishing housing market, we can see why the lower part of the net worth distribution has been hammered in this recession.'' The result is constrained consumer spending and a sputtering recovery.
What is more puzzling is why the United States mustered the will to rescue its beleaguered bankers but not its underwater homeowners. One reason is political muscle. Mr. Sufi himself is one of many economists who have shown that lobbying by the financial services industry influences legislation. (That is hardly a shocking finding -- bankers are expected to be rational enough to spend lobbying dollars because they work.)
Ideas matter, too. The economist Willem Buiter has argued that what he calls ''cognitive capture'' helped cause the financial crisis. Regulators, legislators and academics were not on Wall Street's payroll, but they came to see the world from the bankers' point of view. ''There was very influential academic work on the importance of saving banks. The view that household debt plays an important role in causing financial crises was less prominent,'' Mr. Sufi said. ''Policy makers can't just be bought off. They have to see bankers as key to the economy.''
Mr. Sufi thinks it is probably too late to jump-start the U.S. economy by helping its less well-off homeowners. But he believes the United States' missed opportunity holds an important lesson for Europe. The U.S. mistake, in Mr. Sufi's view, was to give political priority and financial support to credit-holders -- the banks -- while ignoring the distress of debt-holders. He thinks Europe is repeating that error.
In Europe, as in the United States, the creditors, led by Germany, have overwhelming political power. But they may be winning a Pyrrhic victory -- as in the United States, when debtors are hammered too hard, it is tough for the overall economy to grow.

1912 Carnegie to Pension Retired Presidents
NEW YORK -- Mr. Andrew Carnegie, through the Carnegie Corporation of New York, established yesterday [Nov. 21] an endowment fund for future retired Presidents of the United States and their widows. It was stated that each future retired President, and his widow while unmarried, should receive a pension of $25,000 a year, ''as long as these remain unprovided for by the nation.'' Mr. Carnegie said: ''We are the greatest of all pension-paying nations, and yet we exclude the holder of the highest position on earth, exercising the greatest powers, and one seldom if ever occupied by men of independent means.'' President Taft believes that America should pension retiring Presidents so that they may continue to devote their services to their country's good. 
1937 Old Men Giving Way, Says Wells
LONDON -- H.G. Wells, returning to Plymouth today after a six-week lecture tour in the United States, told reporters meeting him at the boat that young Americans have had enough of ''pompous old gentlemen with rhetorical phrases'' and are putting young men into public office. ''I have noticed that there is a tendency to have younger mayors of about thirty-five to forty instead of old duffers of fifty-five to sixty,'' Mr. Wells said. As for the Wall Street slump and current business recession in America, Mr. Wells feels that it is simply a perfectly natural continuation of the 1929 depression. That depression has been delayed somewhat by the efforts of the New Deal, but the old factors that led to the collapse in 1929 have not been removed.
1962 Former President of France Dies
HAVRE -- René Coty, former President of France, died during the night [Nov. 22] of heart complications following an attack of flu. He was 80. Mr. Coty served as last President of the Fourth Republic from Dec. 23, 1953, to Jan. 7, 1959, when President Charles de Gaulle proclaimed the Fifth French Republic. He was instrumental in bringing Gen. de Gaulle to power following the Algiers uprising of May, 1958. Upon turning over the Presidency to Gen. de Gaulle, Mr. Coty retired to his native Havre. He had since kept away from public life after serving for 52 years. He broke his retirement only once -- to vote last month on the Constitutional Council on the legality of Gen. de Gaulle's recent referendum to assure the appointment of future Presidents by direct popular vote.

HEADLINE: Grand Old Planet

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Earlier this week, GQ magazine published an interview with Senator Marco Rubio, whom many consider a contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, in which Mr. Rubio was asked how old the earth is. After declaring ''I'm not a scientist, man,'' the senator went into desperate evasive action, ending with the declaration that ''it's one of the great mysteries.''
It's funny stuff, and conservatives would like us to forget about it as soon as possible. Hey, they say, he was just pandering to likely voters in the 2016 Republican primaries -- a claim that for some reason is supposed to comfort us. 
But we shouldn't let go that easily. Reading Mr. Rubio's interview is like driving through a deeply eroded canyon; all at once, you can clearly see what lies below the superficial landscape. Like striated rock beds that speak of deep time, his inability to acknowledge scientific evidence speaks of the anti-rational mind-set that has taken over his political party.
By the way, that question didn't come out of the blue. As speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Mr. Rubio provided powerful aid to creationists trying to water down science education. In one interview, he compared the teaching of evolution to Communist indoctrination tactics -- although he graciously added that ''I'm not equating the evolution people with Fidel Castro.'' Gee, thanks.
What was Mr. Rubio's complaint about science teaching? That it might undermine children's faith in what their parents told them to believe. And right there you have the modern G.O.P.'s attitude, not just toward biology, but toward everything: If evidence seems to contradict faith, suppress the evidence.
The most obvious example other than evolution is man-made climate change. As the evidence for a warming planet becomes ever stronger -- and ever scarier -- the G.O.P. has buried deeper into denial, into assertions that the whole thing is a hoax concocted by a vast conspiracy of scientists. And this denial has been accompanied by frantic efforts to silence and punish anyone reporting the inconvenient facts.
But the same phenomenon is visible in many other fields. The most recent demonstration came in the matter of election polls. Coming into the recent election, state-level polling clearly pointed to an Obama victory -- yet more or less the whole Republican Party refused to acknowledge this reality. Instead, pundits and politicians alike fiercely denied the numbers and personally attacked anyone pointing out the obvious; the demonizing of The Times's Nate Silver, in particular, was remarkable to behold.
What accounts for this pattern of denial? Earlier this year, the science writer Chris Mooney published ''The Republican Brain,'' which was not, as you might think, a partisan screed. It was, instead, a survey of the now-extensive research linking political views to personality types. As Mr. Mooney showed, modern American conservatism is highly correlated with authoritarian inclinations -- and authoritarians are strongly inclined to reject any evidence contradicting their prior beliefs. Today's Republicans cocoon themselves in an alternate reality defined by Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, and only on rare occasions -- like on election night -- encounter any hint that what they believe might not be true.
And, no, it's not symmetric. Liberals, being human, often give in to wishful thinking -- but not in the same systematic, all-encompassing way.
Coming back to the age of the earth: Does it matter? No, says Mr. Rubio, pronouncing it ''a dispute amongst theologians'' -- what about the geologists? -- that has ''has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States.'' But he couldn't be more wrong.
We are, after all, living in an era when science plays a crucial economic role. How are we going to search effectively for natural resources if schools trying to teach modern geology must give equal time to claims that the world is only 6.000 years old? How are we going to stay competitive in biotechnology if biology classes avoid any material that might offend creationists?
And then there's the matter of using evidence to shape economic policy. You may have read about the recent study from the Congressional Research Service finding no empirical support for the dogma that cutting taxes on the wealthy leads to higher economic growth. How did Republicans respond? By suppressing the report. On economics, as in hard science, modern conservatives don't want to hear anything challenging their preconceptions -- and they don't want anyone else to hear about it, either.
So don't shrug off Mr. Rubio's awkward moment. His inability to deal with geological evidence was symptomatic of a much broader problem -- one that may, in the end, set America on a path of inexorable decline.

HEADLINE: Upbeat Chinese Report Lifts Global Markets

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
LONDON (AP) -- An upbeat Chinese manufacturing survey helped offset the markets' disappointment at another round of grim European figures Thursday, a day when trading was curtailed by the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.
The optimism in the markets came after a manufacturing survey from HSBC. Its Purchasing Managers Index, a gauge of activity, rose to a 13-month high of 50.4 in November from the previous month's 49.5. Readings above 50 denote growth.
The figures gave Asian markets a lift earlier, and that carried through into the European day. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed up 0.7 percent at 5,791.03 while Germany's DAX rose 0.8 percent to 7,244.99. The CAC-40 in France ended 0.6 percent higher at 3,498.22. 
The gains in Europe came despite a survey showing that the area of the European Union that uses the euro remains in recession. The financial information company Markit said its composite P.M.I. for the euro zone, which assesses the service sector as well as manufacturing, rose to 45.8 in November from 45.7 the month before. That signals further contraction in the euro zone economy, which is now in recession, officially defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
''The euro zone might be drifting further into recession, but it seems markets are content to ignore this and focus on figures which suggest that the situation in the global powers of the U.S. and China is improving,'' said Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG Index.
Over recent weeks, the focus of attention has been on two main issues -- whether the White House can come to a deal with Congress on the budget and whether Greece will get its next batch of bailout cash.
Though a deal on either front has yet to be achieved, investors remain confident that their worst fears -- a United States recession and a Greek exit from the euro -- will be averted. A budget deal in the United States is expected to be achieved to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts at the start of next year, while Greece is expected to finally get approval for the release of the money it needs to avoid bankruptcy at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.
That confidence has helped stocks this week as well as given the euro a lift. Europe's single currency was up a further 0.2 percent at $1.2871.
Earlier, Asian markets registered strong gains, helped by the manufacturing news from China, a major market for many countries in the region.
The Hang Seng index of Hong Kong rose 1 percent to close at 21,743.20. South Korea's Kospi added 0.8 percent to 1,899.50 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 1 percent to 4,424.20.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.6 percent to close at 9,366.80 -- its highest finish since May 2 -- as a recently weakened yen provided a vital increase to the export-heavy index. The yen continued to fall back Thursday, with the dollar up 0.2 percent at 82.62 yen.
Oil prices were little changed as traders weighed Thursday's economic figures as well as the cease-fire in Gaza. The benchmark crude for January delivery was down 21 cents at $87.17 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Citing Terror Defendants' Motivation, Judge Shows Sentencing Leniency

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
The three men from the impoverished West African country of Mali were at the mercy of the court. Each had pleaded guilty to a terrorism charge. All had been accused in a plot to move numerous shipments of cocaine across two continents to support Al Qaeda and two other terrorist organizations.
As the men came up for sentencing, each asked for leniency.
Federal prosecutors, in turn, asked for the maximum possible prison sentence: 15 years for each man, a penalty that reflected the seriousness of their threat to society. 
But the judge saw them differently. To her, they were terrorists not driven by ideology or anti-American sentiment, but rather by money and difficult family circumstances.
The judge, Barbara S. Jones of Federal District Court in Manhattan, imposed far less time on each man than the government had sought. Two defendants received about five years each, while the third received just 46 months at his sentencing last Friday; with credit for time served and good behavior, he should complete his term in 2013, and be returned to Mali.
''It seems clear to me that this defendant was not ideologically motivated,'' Judge Jones said in March when she sentenced the first man, Oumar Issa, to 57 months, a view she echoed at the sentencings of the two others last week. ''And this, to me, makes a difference,'' she added, ''and is relevant to whether or not he is looking to commit further crimes and be a danger.''
Although the sentences were quickly praised by federal prosecutors, they could be seen as a rare setback in a high-profile terrorism case involving the use of confidential informants in an overseas sting operation. When the arrests were announced in December 2009, officials said they showed a ''direct link'' between terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and international drug trafficking groups.
Terrorism experts differed over the impact of the relatively shorter sentences. Karen J. Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University School of Law, said that if courts began to ''make distinctions between those who are ideologically motivated and those who are apparently not, that is going to have an impact throughout the system.''
But Anthony S. Barkow, a former federal terrorism prosecutor, contended that the sentences were still substantial, and that ''this case will not deter the government from enforcing the material support statute, even against people who don't have sinister motives.''
But the outcome suggests that the issue is sure to arise in similar cases where actions may have been motivated by economic circumstance.
At Mr. Issa's sentencing, one of his lawyers, Julia L. Gatto, a federal public defender, told Judge Jones that the Malian ambassador to the United States had remarked to her after visiting her client in jail: ''If your country is going to come to my country and offer our young men lots of money to transport drugs or do things criminal, you'd better tell your country to build a lot more prisons, because we are very poor people and it is very hard to pass that up.''
In the sting operation, the drug agency's informants posed as representatives of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a Colombian terrorist group. Their discussions with the Malians, who are all in their 30s, centered on a scheme to transport cocaine from West Africa through the African desert and into Spain, the indictment charged.
One defendant, Harouna Touré, had claimed that he led a criminal organization that worked with Qaeda groups in Africa; he eventually agreed to transport cocaine at $2,000 per kilogram, with some of the money going to pay Qaeda operatives for security through North Africa, the indictment said.
''These narco-terrorists do not respect borders and do not care who they harm with their drug trafficking conspiracies,'' Michele M. Leonhart, the Drug Enforcement Administration's top official, said at the time.
Defense lawyers contended that the men had no connections to Al Qaeda, and had agreed to help move drugs because they wanted to be paid. ''Harouna did not actually know anyone from Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Touré's lawyers wrote in court papers. Mr. Touré received a 63-month sentence.
The three ultimately pleaded guilty to conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group. As part of the deal, the government dropped a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge that carried a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence.
In seeking the stiff 15-year terms, prosecutors argued that a lack of ideological motivation was not a mitigating factor. ''There is no requirement that a defendant who is providing material support to a terrorist organization be driven by ideology,'' a prosecutor, Edward Y. Kim, said at Mr. Issa's sentencing.
He argued that actions like Mr. Issa's were dangerous because terrorist groups derived support not only from people who shared their political convictions but also those who saw financial opportunity.
''The point is that he provided support knowing that it was a terrorist organization, knowing that it had an anti-U.S. agenda,'' Mr. Kim told the judge.
Defense lawyers portrayed all three men's financial circumstances as dire, and at the sentencings, the men apologized and contended they had had no desire to harm the United States.
Mr. Issa, who had been a port worker in Togo, said that he had never heard of the FARC, but that one informant had explained that the group engaged in kidnapping. The informant ''told me all this, but I was focused on the commission he promised me for helping him,'' Mr. Issa said at his plea hearing.
Mr. Touré, a construction worker, became involved in the deal ''because it promised more money than he could imagine making in a lifetime,'' his lawyers, Michael and Miriam Hurwitz, said in court papers. ''My wife was sick and I needed money,'' Mr. Touré told the judge on Nov. 15, sobbing at times.
The third defendant, Idriss Abdelrahman, a car parts seller, had four small children and an elderly mother living in the Islamist-held town of Gao. His two wives had apparently fled to neighboring Niger, leaving his mother to beg for food, his lawyer, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, said in court papers.
''The evidence shows that, far from being a terrorist or large-scale drug trafficker, Mr. Abdelrahman is a hapless tribesman who got involved in a phony drug transaction that he did not understand, which was then disingenuously used by the Drug Enforcement Administration to make a political point,'' his lawyer wrote.
''It's only because of poverty that I got involved in all of this,'' Mr. Abdelrahman said through a Songhai interpreter in court last Friday.
Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, hailed the final two sentences on Friday as emblematic of that office's commitment to combating narco-terrorism, and added, ''Yet another group of would-be terror facilitators have been stopped.''
Judge Jones did make clear that she believed the conspiracy had been serious, given that the men agreed to transport drugs for people who had represented themselves as involved in terrorist activities. But she also noted that the sting operation had not involved a specific detailed terrorist plot, like the one in 2009 by four men in Newburgh, N.Y., to fire missiles at military airplanes.
Citing the men's family circumstances and financial motives, she also explained why the case called for shorter sentences than would have been appropriate had they been spurred by ideology.
''The defendant who is committed to the goals of a terrorist organization,'' Judge Jones said, was far more likely to become a recidivist and ''pose a danger to the world community precisely because of his ideological commitment.''

Previews and Openings
'The Anarchist' (in previews; opens on Dec. 2) If she had never sung a note in her life, Patti LuPone would have a rock-solid stage résumé, thanks in no small part to her collaborations with David Mamet. Fifteen years after starring in Mr. Mamet's ''Old Neighborhood,'' she returns in this drama as a woman who has been imprisoned for 35 years. Playing her parole adviser is Debra Winger, making her belated Broadway debut. John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, theanarchistbroadway.com. (Eric Grode) 
'Bare' (in previews; opens on Dec. 9) This rock musical about sexual confusion and Shakespeare in a coed Catholic boarding school has been kicking around since the Clinton administration. There was an Off Broadway run in 2004, and there have been more than 100 other productions worldwide. The subsequent success of ''Spring Awakening'' and other like-minded shows may have paved the way for this retooled version, which is directed by Stafford Arima (''Carrie'') and choreographed by Travis Wall of ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Grode)
'A Civil War Christmas' (in previews; opens on Dec. 4) You won't see boys on crutches or hear ''bah, humbug'' in this Christmas-themed 19th-century play with music. Paula Vogel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, has set her sprawling new piece on Christmas Eve 1864 and filled it with soldiers, slaves, Mary Todd Lincoln and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Ms. Vogel and her director, Tina Landau, have also found room for period songs and traditional Christmas carols. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Dead Accounts' (in previews; opens on Thursday) This new comedy from Theresa Rebeck tests the strength of family ties when a man returns to his small-town home with a suspicious amount of cash and few answers to the questions raised. The play's deluxe team includes two Tony magnets in the director Jack O'Brien and his leading man, Norbert Leo Butz, with a tasty supporting cast of Judy Greer, Josh Hamilton and Jayne Houdyshell. But the big news here is Katie Holmes: she returns to Broadway in her first starring role there, not to mention her first significant professional adventure since the tabloid storm of her divorce from Tom Cruise. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' (in previews; opens on Dec. 8) The schlubby real estate salesmen in David Mamet's masterful 1984 drama depend on a sucker being born at least every minute. With only seven years having elapsed since the last revival, let's hope new audience members are sprouting up at a comparable rate. Al Pacino, who was so memorable as the agency hotshot in the 1992 film version, graduates to the role of the old lion Shelley Levene. The newest young lion: Bobby Cannavale. Daniel Sullivan, who directed Mr. Pacino in ''The Merchant of Venice,'' takes on that task again. Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Golden Boy' (in previews; opens on Dec. 6) The last time the director Bartlett Sher dipped into the Clifford Odets canon for Lincoln Center Theater, the result was the soul-stirring 2006 revival of ''Awake and Sing!'' With this 75th-anniversary production of the Odets classic about a talented violinist forced to choose between music and a more lucrative career in prizefighting, Mr. Sher returns to the same stage as that earlier Tony-winning success, and also to the same theater where this play had its 1937 premiere. Alongside Seth Numrich (''War Horse'') in the title role, the large ensemble cast includes Danny Burstein, Ned Eisenberg, Jonathan Hadary, Tony Shalhoub and Yvonne Strahovski. Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Golden Age' (in previews; opens on Dec. 4) Terrence McNally has had success both writing about opera (''The Lisbon Traviata,'' ''Master Class'') and writing opera himself (''Dead Man Walking''). He revisits this theme with his latest play, which is set on the opening night of Vincenzo Bellini's new opera ''I Puritani'' in 1835. Lee Pace stars as Bellini and is joined by an array of stage regulars: Bebe Neuwirth, Lorenzo Pisoni, Will Rogers and Richard Easton. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Grode)
'The Great God Pan' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Dec. 18) A young Brooklyn writer seems to have it all -- until the possibility of a dark childhood secret threatens to upend everything. It sounds like fairly well-traveled ground, but the fast-rising playwright Amy Herzog (''After the Revolution,'' ''4000 Miles'') -- along with a cast that includes Becky Ann Baker and Peter Friedman -- should carve out some new vistas along the way. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Ingenious Nature' (previews begin on Friday; opens on Dec. 5) Having already given a hip-hop-inflected primer on all things Darwinian in ''The Rap Guide to Evolution,'' Baba Brinkman returns to the subject matter from a more utilitarian point of view. In short, do alpha males really get all the girls? As the sort of guy who likes to turn evolution and ''The Canterbury Tales'' into rap-theater hybrids, Mr. Brinkman may have a vested interest in this question. SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Grode)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Originally seen in May at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, this adaptation by Aaron Posner of the best-selling Chaim Potok novel was described by Anita Gates, writing in The New York Times, as ''an economical, almost painfully potent 90-minute one-act play.'' In this transfer of Gordon Edelstein's production, Ari Brand reprises the title role of a gifted young painter in postwar Brooklyn who defies the wishes of his Hasidic Jewish parents to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Stock Xenophobia' (performances begin on Wednesday) Naming your theater company Dead Horse would help draw attention anywhere. As would gaining a reputation for daring, award-winning pieces, like the trio of United States premieres on display here by the Amsterdam group Dood Paard. On tap are ''Freetown,'' an acclaimed look at three white women at a West African resort; ''Othello (bye bye),'' in which two actors and one technician take on Shakespeare; and the enigmatic ''Answer Me.'' A warning about that last title: The command is frequently directed toward the audience. La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Grode)
'Trojan Women (After Euripides)' (opens on Wednesday) Anne Bogart's longtime collaborator Charles L. Mee took a crack at Euripides' antiwar classic a few years ago, and now it's Ms. Bogart's turn. She and her protean SITI Company -- working from a contemporary adaptation by another frequent collaborator, Jocelyn Clarke -- aim to bring this 415 B.C. tragedy firmly into the present day. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Grode)
'Volpone' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Dec. 2) Red Bull Theater doesn't mount that many full productions, but when it does, they tend to be memorably visceral takes on the classics. But it gravitates toward the grislier pockets of the canon, which makes this revival of Ben Jonson's 1606 comedy all the more surprising. Count on the likes of Stephen Spinella, Tovah Feldshuh and Alvin Epstein to provide the Jacobean giggles. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, redbulltheater.com. (Grode)
'What Rhymes With America' (in previews; opens on Dec. 12) Through a series of beguilingly off-kilter plays with short titles (''This,'' ''Suitcase,'' ''[sic]''), Melissa James Gibson has emerged over the last decade as one of Off Broadway's freshest voices. She teams up once again with the director Daniel Aukin for this latest piece, about a father and daughter separated by a closed door. The four-member cast includes the recent Tony Award nominee Da'Vine Joy Randolph (''Ghost''). Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'A World I Loved: The Story of an Arab Woman' (Wednesday and Thursday only) This special two-night production, presented by the Public Theater and Columbia University's Miller Theater, reunites Vanessa Redgrave with familiar subject matter: Palestinian history. Ms. Redgrave and Mariam C. Said (the widow of the longtime Columbia professor Edward Said) have adapted the memoir of Ms. Said's Lebanese mother, Wadad Makdisi Cortas. The two women also appear in the piece, along with Ms. Said's daughter, Najla Said, and a group of musicians. Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichés very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'A Christmas Story, The Musical' An amiable, blessedly ungarish holiday musical for family audiences, faithfully adapted from the popular 1983 movie drawing on the writings of Jean Shepherd (2:20). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com, achristmasstorythemusical.com. (Isherwood)
'Elf' This stage musical based on the Will Ferrell movie returns to Broadway with Wayne Knight as the celebrity Santa, though he isn't around much. The production, like all the holiday-themed shows clogging New York theaters, has some funny moments, a couple of decent musical numbers and a lot of generic-feeling songs and synthetic sentiment. Jordan Gelber in the role of Buddy, the human raised as an elf who comes to New York to find his real father, never really finds a comfort zone for the sometimes awkward, sometimes perceptive character (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, elfmusical.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Grace' Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee Semple McPherson' Kathie Lee Gifford (yes, her!) wrote the book and lyrics for this dull musical about the life of the pioneering evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Carolee Carmello is in vibrant voice as the holy roller, but the storytelling is formulaic and the songs merely serviceable (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (877) 250-2929, scandalousonbroadway.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bad Jews' The wonderful Tracee Chimo (''Circle Mirror Tranformation,'' ''Bachelorette'') gives a sensational performance in Joshua Harmon's play, portraying a smart, funny and seriously abrasive young woman who is embroiled in a dispute with her cousin over who is entitled to a family heirloom (1:40). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)
'A Celebration of Harold Pinter' Julian Sands bravely takes on the voice of Pinter the poet in a modest, affecting production that looks for the private person within the artist. By the evening's end, the show, directed by John Malkovich, has also become a celebration of the actor's craft (1:45). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Brantley)
'Checkers' Though briskly paced and attractively packaged, Douglas McGrath's play about a beleaguered young Richard Nixon often seems to float in stylistic limbo, between two or three dimensions. Terry Kinney directs an accomplished cast led by Anthony LaPaglia in the title role and Kathryn Erbe, who brings startling emotional heft to the role of Pat Nixon (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Disgraced' A stimulating, eloquent and bitingly funny new play by Ayad Akhtar about a corporate lawyer of Muslim origins (the excellent Aasif Mandvi of ''The Daily Show'') whose well-heeled life begins to unravel when he becomes involved in a court case involving an unjustly jailed imam (1:20). Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Isherwood)
'Emotional Creature' This collage of songs, monologues and spoken-word pieces by Eve Ensler explore the problems facing young women around the globe, from sex slavery to the plague of mean girls. Performed with vivifying passion by a talented young cast of six (1:30). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'The Exonerated' Ten years after its New York premiere, this documentary play about six death-row inmates who were later freed still has the power to shock (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
'Falling' The Martin family, in Deanna Jent's compact play, is trying to live a normal life despite the outsize presence of their severely autistic son, Josh (effectively portrayed by Daniel Everidge). When a Bible-toting grandmother visits, the emotional temperature rises, and with it Josh's potential for violence. Despite some implausible stacking of the dramatic deck by the playwright, ''Falling'' makes some sound points and invites further investigation into the disorder (1:15). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; 'Figaro' The playwright Charles Morey rescues Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais's late-18th-century comedy ''The Marriage of Figaro'' from the shadow of its more celebrated operatic incarnation with this witty new adaptation for the Pearl Theater Company, inaugurating the classical troupe's new home on West 42nd Street. Directed with a light touch and an infectious wink by Hal Brooks, the farce takes aim at ruling-class entitlement just as surely today as it did in pre-Revolution France. The energetic ensemble is led by Sean McNall and Jolly Abraham as the crafty servant Figaro and his bride-to-be, and Chris Mixon as the lascivious Count determined to get a piece of prewedding action (2:10).

'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'Giant' Michael John LaChiusa's lush score for this adaptation of Edna Ferber's generation-spanning 1952 novel reaches for the clouds. But the countervailing weight of condensing a multitude of themes and plot points keeps pulling this show down to earth, and even threatens to bury it. Michael Greif directs an attractive cast led by Brian D'Arcy James and Kate Baldwin (3:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Golden Child' The first production in the Signature Theater's season devoted to the work of David Henry Hwang is a revival of his 1996 play about a family in early-20th-century China grappling with the encroaching ideals of the West. Juliana Soelistyo, who starred in the original production as the young woman whose bound feet become a bone of contention, is a standout as the sternest and most recalcitrant of the three wives in the family (2:00). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'The Good Mother' Gretchen Mol (''Boardwalk Empire'') plays the title role of a troubled young woman with man problems in Francine Volpe's murky, sluggish drama, directed by Scott Elliott for the New Group (1:40). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' Jake Gyllenhaal makes a very creditable New York stage debut as the stoner uncle of a troubled 15-year-old girl (Annie Funke) in Nick Payne's earnest, shaggy (and conceptually overwrought) story of global warming and domestic meltdown. Michael Longhurst directs a cast rounded out by Brian F. O'Byrne and Michelle Gomez (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Ivanov' Boredom comes in many flavors in Chekhov's early study of provincial lives, and darned if Austin Pendleton's production doesn't provide a different acting style for each one. The lusty comic energy of the show's first half peters out in the second. Ethan Hawke strips the gears of suffering in the title role; Joely Richardson is superb as his neglected wife (3:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Mies Julie' The temperature never stops rising in Yael Farber's blistering drama, which resets Strindberg's ''Miss Julie'' in contemporary South Africa. But be advised: This is a fire that chills as it destroys. Hilda Cronje and Bongile Mantsai give full-immersion performances as the doomed lovers whose very identities come under siege. Ms. Farber directs, compellingly and mercilessly (1:30). St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Murder Ballad' A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a sexy four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman (1:15). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'The Old Man and the Old Moon' The folksy PigPen Theater Company, a wily group of recent graduates of Carnegie Mellon University, including Curtis Gillen, above, employs common items like flashlights, crates and burlap sacks to conjure dozens of characters and tell this tall tale, using live music, puppets and shadow screens. It's a scrappy, low-tech show that is rarely short of magic, and its run has recently been extended through Jn. 6 (2:10). Gym at Judson, 243 Thompson Street, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, pigpentheatre.com. (Jaworowski)
'The Outgoing Tide' The Philadelphia playwright Bruce Graham examines right-to-die issues as reflected in the tough choices made by a retired trucking company owner facing encroaching dementia. Starring Peter Strauss, Michael Learned and Ian Lithgow, the play maps the man's emotionally fraught standoff with his wife of 50 years and their adult son as he seeks to atone for his mistakes while sparing himself further indignity. Well-received in its regional engagements, the play is sensitively observed and affecting if somewhat pedestrian in Bud Martin's production, which nudges the material into Hallmark-movie territory (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'The Piano Lesson' August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, set in Pittsburgh in 1936, returns in a galvanizingly beautiful staging by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, featuring memorable performances virtually across the board. A highlight of the year in theater (2:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Radiance' Set in 1955 with an extended detour back to 10 years earlier, Cusi Cram's guy-walks-into-a-bar play centers on an Air Force veteran desperate to bail on his commitment to appear on an episode of ''This Is Your Life.'' Elaborating on a curious real-life collision between one of the most momentous events in 20th-century military history and a now-quaint relic of American television, Suzanne Agins's production for the Labyrinth Theater Company dulls the conflict with fussy retro-styled treatment. Both the writing and the staging appear to be aping 1940s and '50s movie conventions, but the actors seem stiff and uncomfortable with the artifice. Only David Meyer's detailed set, a dive bar off Hollywood Boulevard, looks like the real thing (1:20). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Sorry' Set on Nov. 6, 2012 (Election Day), Richard Nelson's play -- the third in his Apple family series -- is about as big and as small as a domestic drama can be. Acted by a wonderful cast of five, ''Sorry'' keeps us aware of how every seemingly insignificant detail in one family's life is infused by a much larger picture (1:45). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'A Summer Day' In her first New York stage appearance in more than a decade, Karen Allen is perfectly cast as a woman frozen in time in Jon Fosse's quietly brutal play, which turns a romantic cliché into an existential life sentence. Sarah Cameron Sunde adapted and directs this minimalist Norwegian work, which exerts an eerie dramatic undertow (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'The Twenty-Seventh Man' Nathan Englander's stage adaptation of his crisp, economical short story (from the collections ''For the Relief of Unbearable Urges'') feels sadly bloated and static onstage, despite fine work from a first-rate cast that includes Ron Rifkin and Chip Zien (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as SouthWest Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1844-1915' A group of six actors engage in tense rehearsals for a play about the first genocide of the 20th century in Jackie Sibblies Drury's inventive, superbly acted drama about the disturbing emotions stirred by their seemingly playful interactions (1:30). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, sohorep.org. (Isherwood)
'The Whale' The gentle giant at the heart of Samuel D. Hunter's affecting if somewhat conventional drama is a lonely man named Charlie, who weighs upward of 500 pounds and is played with easygoing warmth by Shuler Hensley (1:55).

Off Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'Neutral Hero' This remarkable new work from the experimentalist auteur Richard Maxwell takes place somewhere between the snug burg of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' and the wine-dark seas of Homer's ''Odyssey.'' Combining original poetry with the most naked of clichés, Mr. Maxwell finds the epic in the American everyday as surely as James Joyce did when he sent Leopold Bloom roving through Dublin (1:20).

'Be Careful! The Sharks Will Eat You!' (closes on Sunday) In his one-man show, Jay Alvarez recounts his family's escape from Cuba in 1964, when he was just 4. Acting at least a half-dozen roles, Mr. Alvarez is an evocative taleteller when reliving the yearlong plans his father made that delivered as many as 30 refugees by boat to the United States. Despite the title, though, and to the play's disadvantage, he describes almost nothing of the 30-hour voyage itself (1:30). Stage Left Studio, 214 West 30th Street, stageleftstudio.net. (Daniel M.

&#x2605; 'Cyrano de Bergerac' (closes on Sunday) Douglas Hodge (last seen in a dress in ''La Cage aux Folles'') provides an oxygenating blast of freshness in the title role of Edmond Rostand's beloved chestnut, creating a vigorous and original portrait of the swashbuckling, big-beaked poet. True, whenever he's not onstage that old ennui creeps into Jamie Lloyd's production. Fortunately, that's not all that often (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Dispatches From (A)mended America' (closes on Monday) Brandt Adams and Godfrey L. Simmons Jr. interviewed 100 Southerners about race following the 2008 election of President Obama. Their efforts yielded a smattering of interesting ideas, but the authors have crowded out these thoughts with their own musings. And so a noble, potentially enlightening exercise becomes a self-indulgent duet with 100 backup singers.

&#x2605; 'The Freedom of the City' (closes on Sunday) The masterful contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel puts a human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland with this stirring drama from 1973 about the shooting by British soldiers of three nonviolent civilian protesters at a march, which echoes the tragic events of Bloody Sunday the year before. Staged by Ciaran O'Reilly with a firm handle on the narrative's time-shuffling structure and a stinging clarity that illuminates the play's multiple perspectives, this drama steadily tightens its grip, from its absorbing beginnings through to its shattering conclusion. The standout among the generally solid cast is Cara Seymour as a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water (2:00).

HEADLINE: Everything's Coming Up Pumpkin Pie

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
DURING Thanksgiving week, the aroma of pumpkin pie wafts throughout the land, as it has for generations. But these days, chances are the source of the smell is not actually pie.
While Starbucks, now serving its seasonal pumpkin spice latte for the ninth year, is often credited with helping popularize the flavor, pumpkin spice has spread to myriad categories.
There were 79 limited-time menu items featuring pumpkin at the top 250 restaurant chains from August through October, more than double the 37 during the same period in 2011, according to Technomic, a restaurant market research firm. 
Those dishes included pumpkin bagels at Bruegger's Bagel Bakery, pumpkin ale at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse and pumpkin spice pancakes at Shoney's.
''Pumpkin,'' a New York magazine headline declared in October, ''is the new bacon.''
Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, said comfort foods often influenced flavor trends.
''That familiarity and comfort feel is something that I think Americans are clinging to because the economy has been rough on many of us,'' Mr. Tristano said, adding that such foods represented ''a nice, simple pleasure and an affordable indulgence.''
It may not occur to a diner at McDonald's washing down pumpkin pie with a pumpkin shake or pumpkin spice latte, but flavor trends are not cooked up by food brands alone. Companies that specialize in flavors often are the instigators.
Dianne Sansone, a flavor chemist and head of technical services at Flavor and Fragrances Specialties, which is based in Mahwah, N.J., said the company first developed a pumpkin spice flavor in the early 1990s for a coffee brand, well before use of the flavor became widespread. Nondisclosure agreements prohibit the company from naming customers, but its Web site says they include both ''Fortune 100'' and ''middle market'' companies.
Typically food brands provide a base, like unflavored ice cream or yogurt, and in a subsequent presentation Flavor and Fragrances serves company representatives samples to demonstrate how a flavor like pumpkin spice tastes in their product.
What companies end up buying is not just a recipe, but a physical product as well.
''We send out 400-pound drums of flavor that go into things like coffee and cupcakes and cookie filling,'' Ms. Sansone said.
Yoplait, a General Mills brand, asked consumers on its Facebook page in 2011 for new flavor preferences, and as a result introduced Yoplait Light pumpkin pie yogurt as a seasonal flavor this year.
Elizabeth Fulmer, associate marketing manager of Yoplait, said sales of the flavor far exceeded expectations.
''We didn't know how big it was going to be,'' she said. ''We did this as a little bit of an experiment this year and the response has been really exciting.''
Planters, a Kraft Foods brand, introduced pumpkin spice almonds as a seasonal flavor in 2011, the same year that Jet-Puffed marshmallows, another Kraft brand, introduced a pumpkin spice variety.
Through a licensing agreement, Unilever introduced Starbucks pumpkin spice latte ice cream as a seasonal variety this year. It is, in other words, an ice cream based on a coffee drink that was based on a pie. Another Unilever ice cream brand, Ben & Jerry's, has marketed a seasonal pumpkin cheesecake flavor for several years.
Hiram Walker introduced pumpkin spice liqueur, a seasonal offering, in 2007, when the flavor ''was popular within coffee but not as widespread as it is today,'' said Juli Falkoff, a brand manager at the company, which is a Pernod Ricard USA brand. ''I feel like this season it's really pumpkin spice time -- it's everywhere you look.''
It may seem paradoxical, but pumpkin spice products often lack a pumpkin note, connoting instead spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and clove that are sold as the pumpkin pie blend in spice aisles.
Coffee brands, among the first to introduce pumpkin spice flavors in products that are not baked, continue to experience strong demand.
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which introduced a seasonal pumpkin spice coffee in 2001, has in recent years begun selling it in early August instead of later in the month because of pent-up demand.
Derek Archambault, senior brand manager at Green Mountain, says that in the first week it is sold each year, it often is the best-selling flavored coffee and occasionally the best-selling roast overall.
Along with Starbucks pumpkin spice latte ice cream, the company introduced an instant coffee version of the flavor this year under its Via line. When some stores, primarily in Manhattan, ran out of what Starbucks calls the sauce used to flavor the pumpkin spice latte in October, a flurry of panicked messages from fans appeared on Twitter and Facebook.
Lisa Passé, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said there was never an actual shortage because warehouses remained well stocked. Rather, she said, individual stores had ''outages'' for a day or two because of the popularity of the flavor.
''This year we saw such increased demand that it's in the running to be the No. 1 seasonal flavor for the entire year,'' said Ms. Passé. In recent years, she added, the top seasonal flavor was peppermint mocha, a winter item.
But some recently released products flavored with pumpkin pie spice have left consumers scratching their heads.
One such offering came from the Kellogg brand Pringles, which introduced a seasonal variety of its stackable potato chips this month that is available only at Walmart.
''Pumpkin Spice Pringles?'' the Twitter user @emptychampagne wrote, expressing a sentiment echoed by many on social networks and blogs. ''I give up. There is no hope for the future. None.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Ways To Raise Taxes But Leave Tax Rate As Is

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional negotiators, trying to avert a fiscal crisis in January, are examining ideas that would allow effective tax rates to rise for the wealthy without technically raising the top tax rate of 35 percent. They hope the proposals will advance negotiations by allowing both parties to claim they stood their ground.
One possible change would tax the entire salary earned by those making more than a certain level -- $400,000 or so -- at the top rate of 35 percent rather than allowing them to pay lower rates before they reach the target, as is the standard formula. That plan would allow Republicans to say they did not back down in their opposition to raising marginal tax rates and Democrats to say they prevailed by increasing effective tax rates on the rich. At the same time, it would provide an initial effort to reduce the deficit, which the negotiators call a down payment, as Congressional tax-writing committees hash out a broad overhaul of the tax code. 
That idea could be combined with the reinstatement of tax code provisions that once prevented the rich from taking personal exemptions or itemizing deductions. Those rules were eliminated by the tax cut of 2001. Reinstating them would tack an additional one to two percentage points onto the effective tax rates of high-income households without raising the 35 percent rate, but which households would be affected has not been decided. In all, tax experts say, families in the top tax bracket would find their effective tax rate jump to 41 percent, even though the top statutory rate would remain 35 percent.
The proposals have been floated as a way to speed up negotiations to avert a crisis in January when the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush expire and across-the-board spending cuts on military and domestic programs automatically kick in. This ''fiscal cliff'' would squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars out of the fragile economy next year and, many economists say, send the country back into recession.
President Obama met a week ago with House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio; Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader; Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader; and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the leader of the Senate Republicans, and both parties emerged confident a deal could be struck.
Since then, progress has slowed considerably. The Congressional leaders had said that aides would provide concrete ideas by Wednesday on deficit reduction targets through revenue increases and changes to social programs, especially Medicare. White House and Congressional staff members did meet early this week, but no such ideas were produced. Democrats want Republicans to first define what they mean by ''structural changes'' to Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans say Mr. Obama should make the first move, using what they say is the political capital gained by his re-election.
But aides involved in the negotiations said they remained confident, in part because many of the ideas that could break the impasse were fleshed out during successive but fruitless deficit negotiations between the president and Mr. Boehner and between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, and during the deliberations of the Congressional ''supercommittee'' on deficit reduction formed during the 2011 impasse over raising the nation's borrowing limit. One Republican aide involved in the current talks said both sides believe a deal can be reached before Christmas.
The supercommittee drafted a proposal that would have eliminated tax brackets lower than 35 percent for affluent families, taxing the first dollar of taxable earnings at the highest tax bracket. In the late 1980s, the tax code included a similar rule, which ''clawed back'' savings from lower tax rates for some rich families.
Under the existing tax code, the first $17,400 of adjusted gross income for a couple filing jointly is taxed at 10 percent. Above that level, up to $70,700, income is taxed at 15 percent. Income between $70,701 and $142,700 is taxed at 25 percent. Gross incomes up to $217,450 are taxed at 28 percent. The next bracket, 33 percent, ends at $388,350 for couples. The top bracket hits adjusted gross incomes only above $388,350.
All taxpayers get the advantage of the lower tax rates below the top threshold, whether they earn $40,000 or $40 million.
If Republicans insist that the top 35 percent rate cannot change while Congress tries to rewrite the tax code, negotiators could decide to technically keep all the Bush-era tax rates in place, but eliminate the lower tax rates for rich households.
''Would you consider that a tax rate increase?'' asked one aide familiar with the idea. ''It would not impact the top marginal rate, and no one would have an effective rate over 35 percent.'' But, he added, taxes would rise for the rich. He, like other aides, spoke on condition of anonymity because Congressional leaders want negotiations to be kept quiet.
A Democrat familiar with the proposal called it plausible, but said its future would depend on an official scoring of how much revenue it would raise. White House and Congressional aides ''are looking at lots of creative options,'' the Democrat said.
Negotiators have at least agreed on the shape of a deal. They would establish a framework that would stipulate fixed amounts of revenues to be raised through rewriting the tax code and through savings to be generated by changes to social programs and other federal programs like farm subsidies. The negotiators also want to propose additional cuts in programs included in annual Congressional spending bills, although Democrats want to hold further cuts to a minimum, arguing they agreed to $1 trillion in domestic discretionary cuts over 10 years in last year's Budget Control Act without a dime in tax increases.
It would be up to Congressional committees next year to draft the legislation to meet those targets, but Congress would be given special instructions to ease passage of the bills.
Once the target numbers are settled, negotiators would have to come up with a down payment on deficit reduction to show the world's financial markets that Washington is serious. That is where the creative tax ideas would come in. The negotiators would also have to agree on a fallback plan that would ensure the deficit would be cut even if Congress failed to approve tax and entitlement overhauls.
The down payment and the fallback are sticking points. Democrats want a large down payment, financed immediately by higher taxes on the rich, preferably by simply letting the top two income tax rates from the Bush era expire. Republicans say the down payment can be minimal.
Arguments over the fallback reflect a philosophical divide. Many Democrats want it to be so onerous that Congress would see no choice but to act on more sensible plans. Some argue that after six months the current looming crisis would simply reappear. Some Republicans say the fallback plan should itself be an acceptable alternative.

HEADLINE: A Bond With a Yield That's Higher, or Maybe Even Edible

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Beth Foster was looking for a better way to invest part of her bonus than a savings account when she received an e-mail from her trusted online travel agent.
The privately owned travel start-up, called Mr & Mrs Smith, was selling a four-year bond directly to its customers, paying 7.5 percent interest in cash or 9.5 percent in Mr & Mrs Smith vouchers that could be used to book vacations.
With memories of a recent trip to Tuscany still fresh in her mind, Ms. Foster, 30, decided to invest just short of £5,000, or just under $8,000, and tapped into a growing market in Britain and the rest of Europe of companies seeking cash directly from individuals eager for higher returns in a low-interest environment.
''This is a much better and more exciting way to invest than a savings account,'' said Ms. Foster, a strategist at Google in London. ''It seemed as safe as anything else right now.'' 
With interest rates at a record low of 0.5 percent in Britain and many savings account rates below the country's inflation level, investors are jumping on products with higher returns, even if they are riskier. Companies are eager to explore new ways of financing as bank lending continues to be tight after the financial crisis.
Britain's retail bond market, where companies large and small go directly to individual investors to raise money, has soared to more than $2 billion a year from about $360 million in 2010 (the figures do not include unregulated bonds issued by the likes of Mr & Mrs Smith, which are not tracked). That is still minuscule compared to the $214 billion in debt issued by companies in Britain this year and $3.7 trillion worldwide.
Similar retail bonds are not offered in the United States, where investors hungry for yield have piled into corporate debt through investment funds. But the retail bonds speak to a broader trend of companies tapping people for money more directly and introducing greater risk. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act that Congress passed this year allows ''emerging growth'' companies to sell stock with fewer restrictions and then report less information to their shareholders than was required from ordinary companies.
Concerns about Europe's retail bonds are emerging, especially with the smaller companies. The bonds might appeal to customers of the companies because they feel they are supporting a start-up firm, but many are risky because they are unregulated and barely traded.
''It's a bit worrying that people are prepared to take extra risk because they know or trust the company brand name,'' said Howard Burchett, director of private clients at broker Charles Stanley. Mr & Mrs Smith said it planned to raise nearly $8 million with the bond and ''cut out the big banks'' while obtaining financing for an expansion plan. Leon, a sandwich shop here, plans to pay interest to its bond investors in salads and meatball wraps, while Hotel Chocolat, a British chocolate maker, has been paying bond investors in boxes of chocolate.
''Interest rates main institutions are offering are very low, there's no trust in financial institutions and it's pointless to keep money in the bank, so people are thinking, 'Why not?' '' Peter Harris, co-founder of Hotel Chocolat, said. The company so far has raised more than $6 million by selling bonds.
While Hotel Chocolat's and Mr & Mrs Smith's unregulated bonds are not publicly traded and are purchased directly from the company, another more liquid and regulated area of the retail bond market is also flourishing. In it, a growing number of larger and publicly traded utilities and financial services firms have been soliciting retail investors over the last year or so.
For these companies, retail bonds are usually a cheaper and faster way to raise money than a traditional corporate bond. They do not require the services of investment banks or expensive road shows to garner investor interest, and listing fees are lower. Companies market their retail bonds directly to their customers through leaflets and by post rather than to financial institutions.
Investors in retail bonds that trade on the London Stock Exchange still need to purchase them through a designated broker, but they do not have to buy into a fund and are exempt from a certain tax on financial investments.
They also don't have to put up as much money. The minimum investment is well below that of traditional corporate bonds. For example, St. Modwen Properties, a real estate company that raised $127 million through a retail bond on Nov. 7, allowed a minimum investment of £2,000, or a little over $3,100. That compares with a minimum of nearly $80,000 for a corporate bond, according to the London Stock Exchange. St. Modwen's bonds mature in 2019 and pay a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent a year. Other companies that issued retail bonds recently include National Grid, a utility; the financial arm of Tesco, the supermarket chain; and Severn Trent, a British water company.
''It's about diversifying our funding sources,'' said Michael McKeon, chief financial officer of Severn Trent, which borrowed about $120 million through 10-year bonds at a variable rate in July of 1.3 percent. ''If it goes well, we should be coming back to this market more often.''
Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said he saw opportunities for similar markets in the United States and elsewhere in Europe.
Given that about three-quarters of corporate funding needs in Europe are met by banks, and banks are deleveraging their lending portfolios, ''we see a good match between the yield in retail bonds and a lot of capital available from retail investors looking for that yield,'' Mr. Rolet said. ''There is no yield these days unless you want to invest in Greek debt.''
Eden Riche, head of debt capital markets origination at Investec in London, said the stock exchange's retail bond market helped to make bonds more attractive to ordinary investors because of greater transparency and a low minimum investment of around $3,000, on average. Once the bonds are traded on the exchange, investors can buy and sell them for as little as £100, or $160.
''You've got this huge pool of retail liquidity sitting dormant in savings accounts that is coming to the bond market, earning higher yield,'' Mr. Riche said. ''But of course there is higher risk associated with this.''
Retail bonds that are not traded on the exchange, like the Mr & Mrs Smith bond, can be bought from the company directly either through their Web site or by sending a check by post.
Ms. Foster, the Mr & Mrs Smith investor, said she discussed the move with her financial adviser, who had his reservations. But in the end, her decision was based on a little bit more than just pure financials. ''I really believe in the brand,'' she said, ''and it's much more appealing using your money supporting a U.K. start-up.''

HEADLINE: Judge Orders Argentina To Pay Holdout Investors

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES (AP) -- Argentina has finally run out of wiggle room in a billion-dollar showdown over foreign debts unpaid since the country's world-record default a decade ago.
Late Wednesday, a federal judge in New York ordered Argentina to pay immediately and in full everything it owed to what the Argentine president calls ''vulture funds'' that she blames for much of her country's troubles. That adds up to $1.3 billion, due Dec. 15.
The judge also barred Argentina from paying other bondholders until it satisfies this judgment, putting the president's back against the wall: if President Cristina Fernández doesn't reverse her longstanding position and pay up, she risks setting off another Argentine debt default, this time totaling more than $20 billion. 
''It is hardly an injustice to have legal rulings which, at long last, mean that Argentina must pay the debts which it owes,'' Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court concluded. ''After 10 years of litigation, this is a just result.''
Argentina's government did not immediately respond to Judge Griesa's orders, delivered just before the Thanksgiving holiday.
Argentina's president and economy minister insisted earlier this week that they would not pay a single dollar to the plaintiffs, and said they would appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.
But the judge gave President Fernández no room to maneuver in the interim, ordering that the money be put in an escrow account for the plaintiffs to collect.
If the president refuses to pay, the judge said that the Bank of New York, which processes Argentina's bond payments, will find itself in violation if it does not hold up payments to all other bondholders.
''It's a mess. This does not help Argentina. Default could happen,'' Alberto M. Ramos, a Goldman Sachs analyst in New York, said on Thursday. ''The markets will react negatively to this.''
The remedy also sent jitters through the legal departments of the most powerful financial institutions in the United States.
The Federal Reserve and the Clearing House, a trade group representing the world's largest commercial banks, told the judge to make sure his order would not affect the funds transfer system, which automatically moves an average of $2.6 trillion a day in half a million transfers between more than 7,000 banks.
As with so many other things involving Argentina, this case is rooted in the bloody dictatorship that ruled from 1976 to 1983. The military junta more than tripled the country's foreign debts. By 2001, the burden had become unsustainable and the economy collapsed. Argentina's $95 billion default still stands as a world record.
Sovereign debt is supposed to be paid no matter who runs a country, but President Fernández has always considered this defaulted debt to be illegitimate, forced onto the Argentines by dictators acting in concert with international financial speculators. She and her late husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner, who took office in 2003, have never made any payments on the defaulted bonds.
Instead, they offered new bonds paying less than 30 cents for each dollar owed in default, and by 2010, 93 percent of the original bondholders agreed to the swaps.
Holdouts led by NML Capital, an investment fund owned by the American billionaire Paul Singer, refused the swaps, insisting on payment in full plus interest. Mr. Singer's lawyers have traveled the world since then seeking to embargo Argentine assets, even getting its navy ship Libertad seized in Ghana as collateral. But they have never collected.
The judge's solution to all this was to force Argentina to pay the holdouts an equal amount each time it made a payment to the exchange bondholders. And since the latter group is due to get $3.3 billion on Dec. 15, the judge said the holdouts must get their entire $1.3 billion by then as well.
If Argentina does comply with the ruling, Moody's Investors Service said on Monday that it could set a legal precedent for other holdouts who together claim nearly $12 billion in unpaid debts.
If Argentina does not fully meet its payments in December, however, the exchange bondholders could demand immediate payment on the entire $20 billion they are owed.
And if this happens, ''the injunction will have turned a relatively minor default into a cataclysmic default that will further unsettle the already fragile global economy,'' the exchange bondholders warned.

HEADLINE: Jeb Bush in 2016? It's Not Too Early for Chatter

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Jim Rutenberg reported from Coral Gables, and Jeff Zeleny from Las Vegas. Lizette Alvarez contributed reporting from Miami.

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Now that the Obama and Romney campaigns have closed their headquarters in Chicago and Boston, the attention of the political world is shifting to an office suite tucked behind the colonnades of the Biltmore Hotel complex here.
The suite is where former Gov. Jeb Bush manages his consulting business, his education foundation and, now, the (very) early decision-making process for a possible presidential run in 2016.
When former President Bill Clinton rolled through here while campaigning for President Obama, he speculated about Mr. Bush's intentions with Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and friend of Mr. Bush. It was no idle topic for Mr. Clinton, given the possibility that his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, could seek the Democratic nomination.
When Senator Marco Rubio of Florida held a strategy session here to discuss his own political future last week, the question of Mr. Bush, a mentor, hung over the room; a decision by Mr. Bush, 59, to seek the Republican nomination would almost certainly halt any plans by Mr. Rubio, 41, to do so or abruptly set off a new intraparty feud. 
Mr. Bush is said by friends to be weighing financial and family considerations -- between so many years in office and the recession his wealth took a dip, they said, and he has been working hard to restore it -- as well as the complicated place within the Republican Party of the Bush brand. Asked this week about whether his father would run, Jeb Bush Jr. told CNN, ''I certainly hope so.''
For now, however, ''It's neither a 'no' nor a 'yes' -- it's a 'wait and see,' '' said Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union and a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Bush. ''It continues to intrigue him, given how much he has to share with the country.''
After Mitt Romney's defeat by a Democratic coalition built around overwhelming support from Hispanics and other fast-growing demographic groups, many Republicans are looking for a candidate who can help make the party more inclusive without ceding conservative principles -- and no one is the subject of more speculation at this point than Mr. Bush.
To his supporters, Mr. Bush is the man for the moment. His wife, Columba, was born and raised in Mexico. He speaks Spanish and favors overhauling the immigration system in a way that would provide a route to citizenship for people already in the country illegally but otherwise law-abiding.
Mr. Bush supports school choice and stricter performance standards, pitting him against teachers' unions but putting him in league with Republican power brokers like the Koch brothers and Rupert Murdoch. Mr. Bush's education project, the Foundation for Excellence in Education, has support from major party donors like the Walton family and the hedge fund executive Paul E. Singer, and has attracted support from the Bloomberg and Gates foundations.
Mr. Bush opposes abortion, and he is no less an opponent of higher taxes than his brother, President George W. Bush, was in his two terms. However, he has refused to sign the antitax pledge of the conservative activist Grover Norquist, who helped lead the rebellion against his father when the elder President Bush broke his own ''no new taxes'' promise during his first and only term.
He could also benefit from what some Republicans see as a modest vein of Bush nostalgia, marked by a video shown at the Republican National Convention about his father, who is 88 and contending with a form of Parkinson's disease and declining health.
Any political future for Jeb Bush depends on whether that warmer tide will be enough to offset lingering bad feelings about the family brand after the presidency of George W. Bush, who continues to be criticized by many conservatives for presiding over bailouts and expanding the size of government.
Still, calls for Jeb Bush to enter the arena in a bigger way represent vindication of a sort. His family's longstanding advocacy for a more broad-based and ''compassionate'' Republican Party was largely ignored and eventually repudiated by the populist, small-government conservatives who held sway over the party after Mr. Obama's election.
George W. Bush's break with the populist right began midway through his second term over his support for a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants, which grass-roots activists labeled an amnesty plan. His push for immigration legislation failed.
This year, even before Election Day, Jeb Bush was warning of what he called his party's ''stupid'' approach to illegal immigration. (Mr. Obama took 71 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to interviews with voters.)
''The day after the election, I started getting e-mails and texts from friends and others wanting Governor Bush to run and asking whether he would,'' said Justin Sayfie, a Florida lobbyist who served as an adviser to Mr. Bush when he was governor.
The calls for Mr. Bush to step forward have grown louder since Mr. Romney told donors that Mr. Obama won the election by giving ''gifts'' of government benefits to Hispanics, African-Americans and younger voters.
''That stupid comment that came out of Mitt Romney's mouth would never in a million years have come out of Jeb Bush's mouth because he doesn't think it,'' said Ms. Navarro, the strategist, who sees Mr. Bush regularly at the Biltmore, a gathering spot for local politicos. ''This election result has made Jeb Bush's voice that much wiser and that much more needed for the Republican Party: What he's been warning about all along proved to be true.''
After waiting his turn following his brother, Mr. Bush, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is not commenting publicly on the election's outcome. But he has assured friends that he will step forward as the nation again grapples with how to address illegal immigration. He is co-author of a book called ''Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution,'' to be published in the spring.
His complicated political considerations include the question of whether the country would consider electing another Bush.
''When do you think John Quincy Adams was able to put his father's unpopularity behind him?'' Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor and Republican Party chairman, said during an interview last week in Las Vegas, where he was attending the annual meeting of the Republican Governors Association.
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, to whom Mr. Bush has given advice, said Mr. Bush's brand is based on his record in Florida and his continuing policy work.
''The irony is the platform that he has is based more on his first name and what he did in Florida than what his last name is,'' Mr. Walker said in an interview.
However, Mr. Bush's friends say, his last name is not his biggest concern. Aside from financial matters, friends said he is also conscious of how a run would affect his family, especially the political prospects of his sons.
Jeb Bush Jr., 29, is a founder of a political action committee, Sun Pac, formed to promote and recruit conservative Hispanic political candidates.
George P. Bush, 36, has filed paperwork in Texas in preparation for a campaign to become land commissioner.
A few days after Election Day, George P. Bush was in Dallas for a fund-raising event for the Foundation for Family Literacy, a group started by his grandmother Barbara Bush.
After reading an excerpt from her novel ''It's Classified'' as part of the program, Nicolle Wallace, a communications director in George W. Bush's White House, addressed the young Bushes in attendance. After the election results, she said, ''I'm counting on all of you.''
Right there, cheering with the crowd, was the family's matriarch, the former first lady.

HEADLINE: Tax Reform Might Start With a Look Back to '86

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
''A tax that places significantly different burdens on taxpayers in similar economic circumstances is not fair. For example, if two similar families have the same income, they should ordinarily pay roughly the same amount of income tax, regardless of the sources or uses of that income.''
-- Tax Reform report of the Treasury Department to President Ronald Reagan, November 1984
As Washington grapples with the budget, it might be worth asking a simple question: What would Ronald Reagan do? 
He was the last president to preside over a significant tax reform, one that did exactly what both candidates in this year's presidential election said they want to do: lower tax rates and close loopholes.
And a critical part of that reform was to end the historical system of taxing capital gains at lower rates than ordinary income.
In the name of fairness, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 raised the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains to 28 percent from 20 percent at the same time it reduced the maximum rate on ordinary income to 28 percent from 50 percent.
Doing that again in a tax reform act of 2013 would do more than raise revenue and increase fairness. It would bring an abrupt end to the ''carried interest'' tax dodge, in which managers in the private equity business are able to define their compensation as capital gains and thus pay far lower income tax rates than do ordinary people with far less income.
Ideally, there will be two tax reform efforts in the next 18 months.
The first, going on now, is a simple patch-up, aimed at dealing with the pending increases in taxes brought on largely by the expiration of the Bush ''temporary'' tax cuts. If the lame duck Congress and President Obama can avert disaster, raising some revenue while not devastating the economy, they will have succeeded.
But the next move should be aimed at comprehensive tax reform. The Obama administration should look to President Reagan's second term for inspiration. The Reagan method included a comprehensive, well-thought-out proposal that dealt with the myriad details that can rise up to frustrate any efforts at change, put together painstakingly by the Treasury Department.
Then there was a bipartisan effort to get it through Congress, with inevitable compromises but with clear goals in mind.
The proper way to approach that proposal is to accept that the government needs to raise a certain amount of money. There can be differences over spending, obviously, but there should be consensus that whatever decisions are reached, the tax system adopted should be expected to finance those expenditures over an economic cycle, with deficits in difficult economic times and surpluses in good years.
With an agreement that taxes should raise a certain amount of revenue -- presumably expressed as a percentage of G.D.P. -- then the debate on actual tax policies can take place in an atmosphere very different from the ones we have had in the past. Every tax deduction and every tax exemption should be viewed not just as giving a break to whatever deserving group has hired a good lobbyist but as forcing the rest of us to pay more.
One way to do that would be to calculate a system, based on a simple progression of tax rates, without any deductions or exclusions, that would produce the needed revenue. Then the debate over each tax break would include a discussion of just how much the rates would have to rise if that break were granted for those who can take advantage of it.
Do you want to preserve the deduction for interest on home mortgages, in the name of encouraging homeownership? Fine. Just understand that it would raise the marginal tax rate for every one of us by a certain number of percentage points. The same goes for charitable deductions, or not taxing certain fringe benefits like the cost of health insurance premiums.
With that in mind, we come to the capital gains tax break. It is defended as critical to economic growth and prosperity, on the theory that without it money will not be invested. But the empirical data to back that up is lacking, to say the least. Over the last 30 years, the economy and the stock market has tended to do better when the capital gains rate was high.
That does not prove causation, of course. But if the data went the other way you can be sure supporters of low capital gains rates would be citing it.
It also needs to be understood that the current system ends up discriminating against many who own stocks and mutual funds and thus receive capital gains and dividends. If your investments are in retirement plans, like 401(k) accounts, the profits are not taxed until the money is taken out. And then the money is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, regardless of whether it originated as capital gains.
As a result, most of the money earned by the highest-income taxpayers comes from tax-advantaged dividends and capital gains. In most years, more than half the capital gains reported to the Internal Revenue Service are received by people with annual incomes of more than $1 million.
The 1985 Reagan plan did propose one break for capital gains. It called for indexing profits to inflation. So if total inflation was 10 percent from the time you bought until you sold, the first 10 percent of profits would be tax-exempt. Congress dropped that idea when it passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, but it could be revived.
Much of the credit for the 1986 bill went to Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who had pushed for lower rates and fewer deductions. He had three fundamental principles -- ones that should inform any serious effort at tax reform. The first was that markets allocate capital better than politicians do, so we risk distortions with tax provisions aimed at encouraging investment in one part or another of the economy. The second was that equal incomes should pay equal taxes, and the third was that those who make more should pay more.
The 1986 law was devised to be revenue-neutral. Any new reform bill will have to raise revenue, which Mr. Bradley said in an interview this week would make the task harder than it was in 1986. He said one approach might be to reduce but not eliminate the value of some deductions for those in the highest tax brackets.
The important issue now is not such details but the development by the administration of a comprehensive plan that can be the basis for legislation, as the Reagan administration did in 1985 and then revised in 1986 after receiving a lot of reaction. That will require a Treasury secretary committed to providing the resources to produce such a report.
That should be a priority for President Obama in picking a new Treasury secretary. Mr. Bradley deserves consideration.
The alternative way to handle a tax proposal is to make one without thinking through the details. The George W. Bush administration tried that in 2003, when it proposed ending the ''double taxation'' of dividends, a worthy goal.
Until then, dividends had been taxable as ordinary income, even though -- theoretically at least -- they came from profits on which companies had already paid corporate income tax. The Bush proposal called for ending the tax on dividends, but only if the company had actually paid federal income taxes on the profits.
Imagine what would have happened if that became the law. All or most of the dividends of a company like General Electric, which manages to pay very little in the way of federal income taxes, would be fully taxable to shareholders. A company that actually paid taxes would have tax-exempt dividends, which might mean a higher stock price.
Unfortunately, the Bush Treasury Department had not worked out all the details, and officials were soon buffeted with questions they could not handle. In the end, the dividend rate was cut to 15 percent, regardless of whether the companies actually paid taxes. A great opportunity for reform was missed.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance Exchanges May Be Too Small to Succeed

BYLINE: DANA P. GOLDMAN, MICHAEL CHERNEW and ANUPAM JENA


HIGHLIGHT: Paradoxically, an increase in competition among insurers may lead to higher reimbursements and health care spending, and thus higher premiums, particularly when the medical provider market is not very competitive, three economists write. 

 BODY:
Dana P. Goldman is the director of the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California. Michael Chernew and Anupam Jena are professors of health care policy at Harvard University. 
With the re-election of President Obama, the Affordable Care Act is back on track for being carried out in 2014. Central to its success will be the creation of health-insurance exchanges in each state. Beneficiaries will be able to go a Web site and shop for health insurance, with the government subsidizing the premiums of those whose qualify. By encouraging competition among insurers in an open marketplace, the health care law aims to wring some savings out of the insurance industry to keep premiums affordable.
Certainly, it is hard to be against competition. Economic theory is clear about its indispensable benefits. But not all health care markets are composed of rational, well-informed buyers and sellers engaged in commerce. Some have a limited number of service providers; in others, patients are not well informed about the services they are buying; and in still others, the quality of the service offerings vary from provider to provider. So the question is: What effect does insurer competition have in a marketplace with so many imperfections? 
The evidence is mixed, but some of it points to a counterintuitive result: more competition among insurers may lead to higher reimbursements and health care spending, particularly when the provider market - physicians, hospitals, pharmaceuticals and medical device suppliers - is not very competitive. 
In imperfect health care markets, competition can be counterproductive. The larger an insurer's share of the market, the more aggressively it can negotiate prices with providers, hospitals and drug manufacturers. Smaller hospitals and provider groups, known as "price takers" by economists, either accept the big insurer's reimbursement rates or forgo the opportunity to offer competing services. The monopsony power of a single or a few large insurers can thus lead to lower prices. For example, Glenn Melnick and Vivian Wu have shown that hospital prices in markets with the most powerful insurers are 12 percent lower than in more competitive insurance markets.
So health insurance exchanges are probably welcome news for hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical and medical device companies throughout the United States. If health insurance exchanges divide up the market among many insurers, thereby diluting their power, reimbursement rates may actually increase, which could lead to higher premiums for consumers.
Ultimately, economic theory predicts that the effect of insurance exchanges on insurance premiums will depend on two offsetting factors. On one hand, smaller, less-consolidated insurance companies may have less bargaining power with large hospitals, physician groups and pharmaceutical companies, which traditionally command substantial market power. Reimbursements to these parties, as well as costs to insurers, may rise in a fractionated market, and if so, these costs would be passed on to consumers as higher premiums. On the other hand, exchanges may inject competition into the marketplace, reducing premiums as even the smallest insurer can market its plans, forcing larger insurers to lower their premiums to remain competitive. Which theoretical effect will dominate in reality is an open empirical question with important policy implications.
There is some evidence on how insurer market power affects premiums. Leemore Dafny, Mark Duggan, and Subramaniam Ramanarayanan have found that greater concentration resulting from an insurance merger is associated with a modest increase in premiums - suggesting that concentration may not help consumers so much - although they did report a reduction in physician earnings on average. Over all, however, the evidence is limited and mixed.
A simple analysis of the nationwide growth in premiums over the last decade is illustrative. Using 2001-10 data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, we examined the relationship between insurer market power (defined as the market share of the two largest companies) and changes in premiums. We found that concentration of insurer power -- hence less competition - was not significantly associated with higher premiums, as can be seen in the chart below.
Hawaii is a good example. Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross Blue Shield together controlled more than 90 percent of the insurance market in 2001. In this highly concentrated market, the average premium rose only 72 percent over the decade, compared to an overall increase of 135 percent nationwide. By contrast, Virginia had one of the most competitive markets in 2001, with its two largest insurers controlling only 25 percent of the market, yet premiums in the state increased nearly 140 percent over the period.
Greater competition in the insurance industry -- either through health insurance exchanges or other measures -- may not lower insurance premiums. Weakening insurers' bargaining power could instead translate into higher costs for all of us in the form of higher premiums.
In financial markets, we ask if banks are too big to fail. When it comes to health care, perhaps we should ask if insurers are too small to succeed.

HEADLINE: UBS Expected to Be Fined in Rogue Trader Scandal

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Swiss bank is expected to face a multimillion-dollar fine in connection to the $2.3 billion trading loss caused by a former trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 

 BODY:
LONDON - UBS is expected to face a multimillion-dollar fine in connection with the $2.3 billion trading loss caused by a former trader, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
The potential fine by British authorities against the Swiss bank may be £30 million to £50 million, or $47 million to $80 million, and could be announced as early as next week, according to one person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
On Tuesday, the former UBS trader Kweku M. Adoboli received a seven-year jail sentence on two counts of fraud in connection with the loss for abusing his position at the Swiss bank from 2008 to 2011. Mr. Adoboli was found not guilty on another four counts of false accounting.
The Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority opened a joint inquiry last year into the enormous trading loss. On behalf of the regulators, the accounting firm KPMG conducted a $20 million investigation into the internal failures at the Swiss bank that led to Mr. Adoboli's trading loss.
The potential penalty could be one of the largest fines levied by the Financial Services Authority of Britain. The regulator fined the British bank Barclays £59.5 million this year in connection with the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. JPMorgan Chase was also penalized £33.3 million in 2010 for failing to protect British clients' money from 2002 to 2009.
The Swiss regulator, which cannot levy fines, is expected to announce its own recommendations. Proposals could include stricter supervision for UBS in the near term.
UBS has dealt with a series of scandals since the financial crisis.
In 2009, the Swiss firm paid $780 million to settle allegations by American authorities that it helped wealthy clients evade United States taxes. The bank paid an £8 million fine to British regulators that year after an employee in the firm's London-based wealth management unit carried out unauthorized trades with clients' money. UBS also was forced to write down credit investments worth around $50 billion from 2007 to 2008.
In a bid to reduce its exposure to risky trading, the Swiss bank announced plans last month to eliminate up to 10,000 jobs in its investment banking unit. Last year, UBS announced a separate batch of 3,500 job cuts.
Sergio P. Ermotti, the bank's chief executive, is refocusing the firm's resources on its profitable wealth management unit, while responding to stricter regulatory capital requirements that has reduced the profitability of certain trading areas.
Up to 45 percent of the newly announced layoffs, or 4,500 people, are expected to be in London. A further 2,500 job losses will come from its Swiss operations, while the remaining layoffs would be borne by UBS's division in the United States.
Shares in UBS rose less than 1 percent in morning trading in Zurich on Friday.
Spokesmen for UBS and the Financial Services Authority declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Franc Thoughts on Bond Vigilantes

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Has the deficit-scare story ever really happened? 

 BODY:
Suzy Khimm writes about the contrast between what financial industry honchos say worries them and what financial markets seem to be saying. The honchos declare that failure to reach a Grand Bargain would 
spark a damaging loss of confidence in the U.S. government's fiscal prospects, a run on Treasury bonds, and a spike in interest rates.
But the bond markets are saying what me worry, with long-term rates at near-record lows.
What Khimm doesn't note, however, is that the problem with bond vigilante scare tactics runs even deeper than that -- because it's actually quite hard to tell a story in which a loss of confidence in U.S. bonds hurts the real economy. Why wouldn't it just drive down the dollar, and thereby have an expansionary effect?
Yes, I know, Greece -- but Greece doesn't have its own currency. What's the model under which a country that does have its own currency and borrows in that currency can experience a slump due to an attack by bond vigilantes? Or failing that, where are the historical examples?
The closest I can come to anything resembling the danger supposedly lurking for America is the tale of France in the 1920s, which emerged from World War I burdened by large debt, and which did in fact face an attack by speculators as a result. Yet the French story does not, if you look at it closely, offer any support to the deficit scare talk we keep hearing.
So, France did indeed have a big debt problem. Here's debt as a percentage of GDP, from the IMF debt database:
How did France achieve that big drop in debt after 1925? Basically by inflating it away.
And markets sort of saw that coming. This study (pdf) by the Bank of France show medium-term interest rates (black line) rising substantially for much of the 1920s, before dropping off sharply:
It's important to note, however, that France wasn't a depressed economy in the 1920s, and therefore didn't look much like America today:
Meanwhile, the really big effect was a sharp depreciation of the franc, which made France highly competitive and strengthened the economy:
But what about the brief but nasty slump in 1927? That wasn't caused by spiking interest rates; it was, instead, caused by fiscal austerity, by the measures taken to stabilize the franc.
So even when we look at the closest thing I can find to the scenario the deficit scolds want us to fear, it doesn't play out at all as described.
It's quite remarkable: our policy discourse remains largely dominated by fears of an event that the fear-mongers can't explain in theory, and for which they can offer no historical examples in practice.

HEADLINE: Creating a Vital Long View for Gauging Environmental Change

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Scientists build part of a continent-wide system for monitoring long-term change in important ecosystems. 

 BODY:
[Production note: I'm helping my older son relocate to New Orleans (22 hours of driving) so comment moderation and posting will be unavoidably sporadic for a few days.]
Last year, Michael SanClements, an ecologist affiliated with the Institute of Arctic & Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, sent a Dot Earth "Postcard" about a project studying soil microbes in Antarctica. Here's a fresh contribution from SanClements, along with colleague Jeff Taylor, from the other end of the planet -- Alaska's Arctic tundra. 
They are both staff scientists with the National Ecological Observatory Network, an initiative supported by the National Science Foundation that has a goal of creating a view of ecological change that spans the continent over the next three decades. As they explain below, without consistent monitoring, it's hard to gauge the scope and causes of changes in environmental conditions: 
Some ecosystems provide economic and social benefits at the local level. Others exist far from our cities in inconceivably large landscapes and have the ability to influence processes at the global scale. The tundra is such a place -- remote, vast and home to enormous stores of frozen carbon which play a critical role in our climate's future. Earlier this fall, we visited the tundra as part of a massive new project which will monitor ecological change across all of the continent's major ecosystems.
 Toolik Field Station -- 158 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska. It's dusk and we've just arrived. Thom Walker, the assistant camp manager, has been kind enough to save us some dinner. From the windows in the cafeteria, we can see ptarmigan, white against the brown of the tundra. And in the distance, more white -- the snow-covered Brooks Range rising to meet an enormous autumn moon. A beautiful landscape, and one we consider ourselves lucky to spend time in.
We're here because we need to prepare a temporary meteorological station to survive the long dark winter. Built in June by Dr. Henry Loescher, the tower, located high on a ridge overlooking the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and Dalton Highway, is collecting data on prevailing wind directions and annual temperature variations that are crucial for the design and construction of a National Ecological Observatory Network research site. Eventually, a tower will be built here that will measure not just meteorological data, but a suite of observations related to solar radiation, greenhouse gases, pollutants, the terrestrial carbon cycle and soil.
With six such sites planned in Alaska, and 60 total in the United Sates, this network, best known under the acronym NEON, is the world's first continental scale ecological observatory. Over the next 30 years, these sites will collect hundreds of terabytes of ecological data annually to help understand the impacts of climate change, land-use change and invasive species on natural resources and biodiversity. 
The Toolik Field Station and tower site are extremely remote. We flew into Deadhorse, or Prudhoe Bay as it's often called. It's not so much a town as a rugged industrial work camp situated near the frigid Arctic Ocean at the far end of the pipeline; it exists mainly to facilitate the extraction and pumping of oil. From there, you head south on the Dalton highway, the lone road, for hundreds of miles. After three bumpy, sometimes scary and always beautiful hours you'll find Toolik Field Station. Situated on the north side of the Brooks Range and the shores of Toolik Lake, the station supports hundreds of scientists each year as they study the changing Arctic.
In this era of rapid environmental change driven by the pressures of expanding human population and a changing climate, long-term ecological research is more important than ever. Short-term data sets are like snapshots of the environment at a single point in time. They lack the temporal context to effectively answer questions about the trajectory and causes of environmental change.
Initiatives like NEON and the Long Term Ecological Research Network aim to help us to track and understand the effects of human activities on ecosystems that provide valuable services to society. It may not be as sexy as the Mars Curiosity Rover or a big field campaign to an exotic place, but sustained, long-term observations are essential to answering many scientific questions and may one day be used by future generations to answer questions that haven't been asked yet.

HEADLINE: Some Funny Dancing to Help Ai Weiwei

BYLINE: ROSLYN SULCAS


HIGHLIGHT: Anish Kapoor goes Gangnam to support the embattled Chinese artist. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- Given that a fair proportion of the millions of people who have watched the irresistibly catchy, irrepressibly cheesy YouTube music video "Gangnam Style," by the South Korean singer Psy, have felt compelled to produce their own version, it's possibly no surprise that the artist Anish Kapoor has followed suit, even if one doesn't exactly think of him as the sort of person to be dancing around on YouTube.
 But Mr. Kapoor's video, which was posted this week and has already had more than 60,000 hits, has a serious intent. It refers to the shutting down last month of another homemade take on "Gangnam Style," by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, whose consistent criticism of the Chinese government has led to his passport being taken away and regular harassment by the authorities. 
In his version, called "Grass-Mud Horse Style," (a reference to a mythical creature invented by Chinese bloggers whose name sounds, in Chinese, like a particularly colorful obscenity), Mr. Ai wears a neon-pink shirt and dark glasses and dances (rather well) in the rodeo-wrangling style of Psy, with no explicit political inferences, apart from a pair of handcuffs dangling from his wrists. 
 The Chinese authorities nonetheless lost no time in removing the video from the Internet in China, and Mr. Kapoor, who has publicly expressed his support for Mr. Ai in the past, said in a telephone interview that he had felt compelled to act. Here are edited excerpts from a conversation about his "Gangnam for Freedom," which was choreographed by Akram Khan and drew almost 400 participants, including the writer Hanif Kureishi, the artist Mark Wallinger, dance-world luminaries like Deborah Bull and Tamara Rojo, and institutions like MoMA, the Whitney and the New Museum.
 Q. 
 How did this idea come about?
 A. 
 I was doing a show in Korea, and a friend sent me Ai Weiwei's video, which I found very amusing. Before I knew it, it was taken off the Web, and I thought, well, maybe it's possible to do something silly and promote a serious issue. I had done other things before to support him; when I made "Leviathan" at the Grand Palais last year, I dedicated it to him. So I came back, and got going. Amazingly all sorts of people wanted to be part of it. Not least Akram Khan. I'd worked with Akram before, but never danced with him; it was amazing. There were nearly 400 of us, and he turned us into a singular unit. I'm no dancer, but a certain abandon came into play.
 Q. 
I see that you don't attempt a direct imitation of Psy's rodeo-style steps, as Ai Weiwei does? Who decided what it would look like?
 A. 
Well, he is a much better dancer than I am! But I left that decision - what take on the original he wanted - to Akram.
 Q. 
Who did you approach to be in the video?
 A. 
I appealed to people from all walks of life. I was amazed by who and how many turned up, including Glenn Lowry, the director of MoMA. The U.S. response has been exemplary, which is sadly not the story in the U.K. There wasn't one U.S. institution that failed to respond, but the British institutions were very reticent about taking part.
 Q. 
Why do you think that is?
 A. 
I can't really understand it, except perhaps there is a perceived agenda with China, even though we are not directing this only at China. We see ourselves in recession, the Chinese economy is growing. Perhaps the government thinks we can't afford to criticize, and that trickles down? I think the standard policy, that governments always put forward, of being polite in public and tough in private, is the wrong way around, because perception, as in most things, is three-quarters of the battle. So it's up to individuals to act. My instinct is that people really do want to be involved; that they feel deeply there are real issues that affect our fellow citizens.The response I had says something about our need, at a time when governments lack the political will, to say anything about human rights.
 Q. 
Do you know Ai Weiwei? Did you let him know you were doing this?
 A. 
As it happens, I've never met him, but we did speak on the phone before I made the video. My sense was that he was stilted, that we were probably being listened to. He said he felt "it was a good inspiration for young people." You could interpret that in a number of ways.
 Q. 
What effect do you hope to have?
 A. 
I hope that a new regime in China will see that it cannot possibly be in their long-term, or even medium-term, interest to stifle artists and poets. What has Ai Weiwei really done? He said that a number of schools that fell down in an earthquake, killing children, were badly built. In a relatively sane world, that's a reasonable criticism. So one would hope for a more enlightened approach to a freedom of expression. What's interesting about using Gangnam is that it is a song with words we don't understand, using dance moves that are very straightforward, with a lot of humor. All Ai Weiwei does is take handcuffs out of his pocket, and that's enough to make a political comment. I've made it much more explicit, because I can.

HEADLINE: When 2012 Sounds Like 1982

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The president wanted a deal to raise taxes and cut spending, and thought a leading Republican was unreasonable to oppose the tax increase. That may sound like Barack Obama, but it was actually Ronald Reagan. 

 BODY:
Here's a situation that sounds like the current one, but isn't:
The president faces a weak economy and a split Congress, with some Republicans furious over the president's endorsement of a plan to cut budget deficits with a combination of a tax increase and budget cuts. 
"He is adamant that we are wrong on the tax increase," wrote the president after meeting with one leading House Republican. "He is in fact unreasonable."
The year was 1982, the president was Ronald Reagan and the congressman was Jack Kemp.

HEADLINE: Fewer Homes Now Underwater

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Home values rose 1.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, according to Zillow's home value index.
As a result, negative equity -- the unfortunate condition that occurs when your home is worth less than your mortgage -- fell again in the third quarter, the report found. 
Currently, 28.2 percent of all homeowners in the United States with mortgages have negative equity (otherwise known as being underwater), down from 30.9 percent in the second quarter, Zillow says. The drop is significant, Zillow says, because it is the first time that overall negative equity has fallen below 30 percent since the site revised its methodology in early 2011.
Roughly 14 million homeowners with mortgages were underwater in the quarter, down from 15.3 million in the second quarter. In addition, the country's 30 largest metropolitan areas experienced a quarter-to-quarter decline in negative equity, the report said.
Of those 30 metro areas, the five with the largest declines in negative equity were Phoenix (down 6.2 percentage points), Las Vegas (down 5.5 percentage points), Denver (down 4.9 percentage points), Sacramento, Calif. (down 4.6 percentage points) and Orlando, Fla. (down 4.2 percentage points).
Much of the decline was caused by rising home values. Home values rose 1.3 percent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, to a median value of $153,800, according to Zillow's home value index.
"The fall in negative equity rates means homeowners have additional options for refinancing or selling their homes," Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, said in a statement.
But he cautioned that a "substantial number" of homes were still underwater, which made their owners reluctant to put them on the market. In addition, risks in the overall economy -- like the unresolved federal budget negotiations -- could hurt the housing market's momentum, he said.
Zillow's negative equity report analyzes current outstanding loan amounts for owner-occupied homes and compares them with the estimated values of those homes. Loan data comes from TransUnion, one of the three major credit-reporting bureaus.
Has the value of your home risen over the last three to six months?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: After Storm, Dry Floors Prove Value of Exceeding City Code

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
In the countdown to Hurricane Sandy last month, construction workers on a teeming pier in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, rushed to strap down materials and move forklifts and excavators into half-built structures to shield them from the tempest to come.
But the real storm preparations had been accomplished six years earlier, when Sims Metal Management approved a design for a state-of-the-art city recycling plant that is rising at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal.
Reviewing projections for local sea-level rise, the company and its architects decided to elevate portions of the site to heights exceeding city requirements by four feet. Using recycled glass and crushed rock discarded from projects like the Second Avenue subway line, they raised the foundation for the plant's four buildings and a dock.
The fill added $550,000 to the plant's costs of around $100 million, said Thomas Outerbridge, Sims Metal's general manager. 
But it proved more than worth it. When a 12-foot storm surge swept through nearby streets and parking lots on Oct. 29, the plant's dock and partly completed buildings did not flood.
''It paid for itself long before we expected it,'' Mr. Outerbridge said. ''It was built with the idea that, over the next 40 years, this would prove a prudent thing -- and the proof came during construction.''
For years, experts have warned that New York City has failed to keep pace with the threats posed by sea-level rise along the 520-mile coastline of the city's five boroughs. Builders that have taken steps on their own, like Sims Metal, have been relatively few.
But as city officials and real estate developers ponder a landscape of devastation from the South Street Seaport in Lower Manhattan to the Rockaways in Queens to Midland Beach on Staten Island, new flood protections for all building types suddenly seem inevitable, whether voluntary or mandated by new laws.
''Now there's a different calculus,'' the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said. ''You pay now or you pay more later.''
Last week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn convened a new ''building resiliency'' task force to study potential changes in the building code and to make recommendations by the summer. Ms. Quinn said she anticipated that the city would require retrofits to reinforce existing structures and more floodproofing for new projects.
The chairman of the task force, Russell Unger, is executive director of the Urban Green Council, which advises the city on sustainable building issues. He said the new group would need to address both direct impacts from the storm, like structure collapse and flooding, and secondary ones, like power losses from utility failures. Levels of protection will have to vary according to location, building use and other variables, he said.
Speaking of the different expectations for different buildings, for example, Mr. Unger said, ''we probably expect elevators at senior centers to work, no matter what happens.''
Some of the potential measures are relatively simple, like keeping sandbags handy and installing floodgates at building entrances. Others are more complicated, like relocating critical equipment like boilers above ground level or encasing them in watertight enclosures and rebuilding houses on concrete piles.
The storm's aftermath also revealed a need for emergency generators to run at least one elevator in tall residential buildings and to pump water to high floors so the buildings remain habitable after a severe storm, some owners said.
Yet some builders say they have every incentive not to wait for government mandates and have taken some steps on their own.
At Queens West, the sprawling multiuse riverfront complex in Long Island City, Queens, the developer TF Cornerstone built higher over fill, eliminated basements, installed mechanical systems on the first and second floors and added floodgates at the entrances of five residential buildings, said Jon McMillan, the firm's director of planning. He said the firm was acting on advice from Architectonica, a Miami firm that is familiar with the ravages of hurricanes.
During Hurricane Sandy, Mr. McMillan said, the water did not reach the lobby doors of the five buildings, which are all occupied, so the protections were not tested.
Still, such provisions might have made a big difference at another TF Cornerstone property, the 52-story luxury high-rise at 2 Gold Street in Lower Manhattan, he said. The flooding there knocked out the building's electrical and mechanical systems, and residents of its 850 apartments have been told they cannot return home until March because the equipment, which corrodes with saltwater, has to be reordered and built.
''This is in the center of Lower Manhattan on the East Side, so we were not thinking about sea-level rise,'' Mr. McMillan said of the building, completed in 2005.
TF Cornerstone is now planning to create watertight, submarine-like enclosures for the electrical room and other equipment at 2 Gold, he said. And the firm is considering placing all mechanical equipment above ground in a new Midtown project it envisions building on the Hudson.
Some in the real estate industry predict a new appeal for midrise buildings. Thomas Guss, a broker who caters to an international wealthy clientele, said interest in smaller luxury residential buildings like the 19-floor Centurion, a condominium at 33 West 56th Street designed by I. M. Pei, had doubled since the storm. He said potential buyers had told him they feared being trapped in their apartments with no lights or water, or having to climb 50 flights of stairs.
''Suddenly, people who wanted the 50th floor now want the 15th,'' he said. ''People realize that when there's no elevator, maybe the view is not as magical anymore.''
Some developers worry about losing rentable space above ground to mechanical equipment. Others are reluctant to forgo the aesthetics of ground-floor luxury retail stores. Still, that lesson has been well absorbed in flood-prone areas of New Orleans and Hamburg, Germany, where homes have been rebuilt on stilts and waterfronts raised.
Some architects and building experts say the city should widen its efforts to plant more wetlands and parks that can serve as natural buffers to floods. ''All the little blades of grass actually makes the flow of the water lower,'' said Susannah C. Drake, associate director of the Cooper Union Institute for Sustainable Design and the principal architect at dlandstudio.
What does not seem to be getting consideration, at least for now, is banning development altogether in the city's flood zones, humble or affluent.
''This is not a viable policy option in New York City, and to be honest, nor is it in any other major coastal city I've been working,'' said Jeroen Aerts, a water risk expert from the Free University in Amsterdam who has been hired by the mayor's office to assess flood protections. ''The stakes of developers and general economic activities in the waterfront are too high.''
In Mr. Aerts's view, the most realistic options for New York are to build levees and surge barriers, and elevate and floodproof buildings.
Ms. Quinn, a likely candidate for mayor when Mr. Bloomberg's term expires at the end of 2013, said changes in the building code were a far higher priority than rethinking zoning rules. But she said that nothing was off the table.
''I don't think there's anything that's taboo to discuss at this point,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Oil Supply Is Rising, But Demand Keeps Pace And Then Some

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
IT used to be taken for granted that as economies grew, they would use more oil. That was a major reason cited in warnings that the world would run out of oil, particularly if standards of living rose in developing countries.
Well, standards of living are improving in developing countries, but the dire forecasts now appear to be wrong. In part that is because new discoveries and improving technologies have increased the amount of oil that can be produced. It also reflects conservation, in part, as cars become more efficient and as other steps are taken to reduce oil use. 
The International Energy Agency, in its 2012 World Energy Outlook, released last week, forecast that American oil production, which began to rise in 2009 after decades of decline, would continue rising through at least 2020, when it could be about as high as it was in 1970, the year of peak production.
At the same time it forecast that by 2035, American oil consumption, which peaked in 2005, could decline to levels not seen since the 1960s, depending on how much conservation is encouraged.
The I.E.A. report also forecast that by around 2020, the United States could surpass Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer, and that while the country was not likely to become a net exporter of oil, the North American continent as a whole could be by around 2030.
But despite declining demand in some countries that historically were heavy users of oil, the world demand for oil seems likely to continue to rise. The I.E.A. forecast that global energy demand -- including demand for energy produced by other sources -- is likely to rise by 35 percent by 2035, with a large part of the increase coming from China and India.
In 1969, the United States consumed a third of the oil used in the world, while China used less than 1 percent. Last year the United States' share was less than 22 percent, while the Chinese accounted for 11 percent. The I.E.A. forecasts that by 2030, the American share could be less than the Chinese one.
By 2035, American consumption of oil is expected to be as much as one-third less than it was last year. In China, oil consumption is expected to be up as much as two-thirds from the 2011 level, and India's is predicted to more than double.
The accompanying charts show trends in oil consumption in the United States, Japan, China and India, as well as in the other major economies -- defined as the 32 countries other than Japan and the United States that are in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In each chart, the oil consumption in 2011 is shown as 100 percent, and the amount of oil used in that year is shown.
For each area, two forecasts are shown. One is based on the assumption that current policies will continue. The other, labeled ''new policies'' by the I.E.A., assumes that countries will gradually keep promises they have made to encourage conservation -- promises that in the United States include increasing fuel economy in cars and trucks and at least a small increase in the use of natural gas to fuel trucks. The I.E.A. says that if those promises are kept, oil prices in real terms are likely to be only a little higher than they are now; if current policies continue, the price is likely to rise more rapidly.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Oil Forecast: The International Energy Agency forecasts that demand for oil will rise in the developing world over the next quarter-century. But demand is likely to fall in the developed world, particularly if countries adopt conservation policies as they have generally said they will, although often without providing specifics.

HEADLINE: Catalan Vote Could Be a First Step Toward Self-Rule

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER

 BODY:
MADRID -- The depth of Catalonia's challenge to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy should become clear on Sunday, when an early election could help determine whether Spain's most powerful economic region eventually splits from the rest of the country.
The vote comes at a difficult moment for Mr. Rajoy, who stands on the front lines of the euro crisis and is under pressure to decide whether Spain needs more financial assistance through bond purchases by the European Central Bank. Mr. Rajoy is also battling record unemployment and street protests against his austerity measures. 
Artur Mas, leader of Catalonia's regional government, called the election two years early after failing to convince Mr. Rajoy to ease Catalonia's federal tax burden, and following a massive pro- independence rally in Barcelona on Sept. 11. That turnout by hundreds of thousands of Catalans has galvanized the region, where the distinctive Catalan flag is on display in shops, bars, and even bare hilltops.
If he triumphs on Sunday, Mr. Mas has pledged to hold a referendum on independence, defying warnings from Madrid that this would violate Spain's constitution.
Initially, Mr. Rajoy tried to combat the Catalan challenge by urging greater national unity and solidarity among Spain's 17 regions. In recent days, however, the prime minister has thrown some of his natural caution to the wind and accused Mr. Mas of acting irresponsibly by turning the vote into a divisive plebiscite on independence and thus diverting Catalans' attention from his own financial mismanagement.
Last Sunday, Mr. Rajoy told a rally in Catalonia that Mr. Mas had achieved nothing except ''create divisions, generate conflicts and waste precious time in the fight against the crisis.''
Mr. Rajoy also rebutted the idea that independence could give Catalonia's 7.5 million inhabitants greater clout. ''To be somebody in today's world, the bigger you are the better, and the smaller the worse,'' Mr. Rajoy argued.
Still, in a region with its own Catalan language and identity, the current crisis has helped bring longstanding cultural and economic resentments to a boil.
And far from being too small, Mr. Mas is arguing that Catalonia and its &#x20ac;200 billion, or $260 billion, economy could fit comfortably within a European Union that already contains a dozen smaller nations and should in future be coordinated more clearly from Brussels.
In an interview with the International Herald Tribune in October, Mr. Mas suggested Catalonia could become a state comparable to Massachusetts, ideally as ''part of the United States of Europe.''
While Mr. Rajoy has shown wavering leadership and been forced by deepening recession to break several pledges made when he campaigned for election last year, Mr. Mas has managed to thrust his separatist goal to the top of Spain's domestic political agenda.
Alfred Bosch, a national lawmaker from Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, or ERC, a party that has long pushed for independence, likened Mr. Mas to someone entering the thick of battle.
''Artur Mas is like a swimmer who is just trying to ride the waves and getting pushed by the current, but is somehow skillful enough to make it look as if he's really a strong swimmer,'' he said in an interview.
In fact, recent opinion polls show Mr. Mas and his Convergencia i Unió party winning on Sunday, but falling short of an absolute majority in the Catalan Parliament. The eventual outcome is uncertain, depending on the showing of smaller parties, such as ERC, that may or may not ally with Mr. Mas.
Recent surveys show that Catalans remain divided over whether any rupture with Madrid should be limited to fiscal sovereignty, or go beyond that.
Catalonia contributes almost a fifth of Spain's economic output. But the crisis has shone the spotlight on mismanagement by Catalonia's own politicians, which helped its debt balloon to &#x20ac;42 billion of the &#x20ac;140 billion debt of Spain's 17 regional governments. With a junk debt rating, unable to tap financial markets, Catalonia was recently forced to ask Madrid for an emergency loan of &#x20ac;5 billion.
Mr. Mas has cast that not as a sign of Catalonia's weakness but as proof of the need to lower the Catalan contribution to a system that redistributes revenues from richer to poorer regions. Whatever the outcome of Sunday's vote, any subsequent fiscal concession by Mr. Rajoy could go a long way toward deflating the Catalan drive for independence.
For now, the election campaign has turned personal, and vitriolic. Mr. Mas, 56, this week launched a libel action against El Mundo, a conservative Madrid newspaper, over corruption and tax evasion allegations.
''I hope to be the last president of Catalonia whom the Spanish state tries to destroy,'' Mr. Mas told a rally this week, adding that his successor will in any case ''no longer depend on the Spanish state.''

HEADLINE: Time to Impose a Plan

BYLINE: By YONATAN TOUVAL

 BODY:
Tel Aviv
AS the dust settles over the Israel-Gaza border, attention shifts to New York, where the Palestinian delegation will ask the United Nations next Thursday to upgrade its status to that of ''nonmember state.'' In short, to recognize Palestinian statehood.
The date, Nov. 29, is not random. On that late November day 65 years ago the U.N. General Assembly convened at temporary premises in Lake Success on Long Island, New York, and voted to approve the partition of British Mandatory Palestine into two states; one Jewish, one Arab. That vote was the legal basis for the establishment of the state of Israel six months later, and is the basis for the Palestinians' claim to a state to this day. 
The history of what followed will forever remain open for debate. Not so what needs to be done now.
Over the past 10 years there has been growing consensus that the only solution to the long conflict lies in the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- areas that were under Jordanian and Egyptian control, respectively, during the 19 years that elapsed following the end of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 and before the eruption of the Six-Day War in June 1967.
Yet the dilemma of many states on how to vote in the United Nations is real. For however morally right and historically overdue, a resolution recognizing Palestinian statehood might not only fail to advance the Palestinian cause, it might even set it back.
Both the United States and Israel have warned of retaliation should such a vote take place.
Following last year's attempt by the Palestinians to gain full admission to the United Nations, the U.S. Congress has threatened to withhold crucial economic aid to the Palestinian Authority as well as to the United Nations itself. Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to take retaliatory action as well, such as withholding Palestinian tax revenues, expanding settlement construction and even toppling the Palestinian Authority.
In contemplating how to respond to the Palestinian bid, therefore, the challenge for the international community is how to proceed in a manner that would advance the prospects of Palestinian statehood -- a requisite element in the two-state solution -- without driving a stake through the heart of the already moribund peace process.
One way out of this conundrum is the following: Between now and Nov. 29, the United States and other key members of the international community should seek to convince the Palestinians to suspend their bid at the General Assembly in return for a Security Council resolution that would, for the first time in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, spell out the general parameters for peace.
What's in it for the Palestinian leadership of Mahmoud Abbas is simple but compelling: trading symbolism for action.
After all, Security Council resolutions are binding, General Assembly ones are not. Hence, a Security Council resolution on the parameters for two states will enshrine Palestinian national goals in international law. A General Assembly recognition of Palestinian statehood, by contrast, will do little more than offer symbolic encouragement.
To be sure, formulating parameters that are acceptable to both the Palestinians and Israel is not easy. But it is enough that the parameters reflect the long-established view of the international community, which is also that of the one and only power broker that both the Palestinians and Israel respect, the United States.
Those parameters were first laid down by President Bill Clinton, then elaborated upon by President George W. Bush and underscored by President Barack Obama. Between the three of them, the full outline for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been sketched.
Such a resolution would require Israel to accept a territorial compromise on the basis of the 1967 lines and the Palestinians to concede on the issue of refugees. At the same time, the resolution could and should go a long way in easing Israel's security anxieties and meeting Palestinian claims to the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.
In order to add teeth to the resolution, the Security Council should not satisfy itself with defining the parameters of a solution. It should also order the parties back to the negotiating table; set a time limit -- say, one year -- to the conclusion of the talks between them; outline a series of actions that the international community would immediately take to support the process; and, finally, declare what the international community would do should the parties fail to reach an agreement within the specified time period.
The failure of the Arab leaders to accept the 1947 partition plan has compelled the Palestinians to await their own Lake Success. A U.N. Security Council resolution that turns a potentially symbolic triumph for the Palestinians into concerted international action on the two-state solution could be that day for them. It will also be a victory for Israeli-Palestinian peace.

SAN RAMON, Calif. -- When Sharoda Paul finished a postdoctoral fellowship last year at the Palo Alto Research Center, she did what most of her peers do -- considered a job at a big Silicon Valley company, in her case, Google. But instead, Ms. Paul, a 31-year-old expert in social computing, went to work for General Electric.
Ms. Paul is one of more than 250 engineers recruited in the last year and a half to G.E.'s new software center here, in the East Bay of San Francisco. The company plans to increase that work force of computer scientists and software developers to 400, and to invest $1 billion in the center by 2015. The buildup is part of G.E's big bet on what it calls the ''industrial Internet,'' bringing digital intelligence to the physical world of industry as never before.
The concept of Internet-connected machines that collect data and communicate, often called the ''Internet of Things,'' has been around for years. Information technology companies, too, are pursuing this emerging field. I.B.M. has its ''Smarter Planet'' projects, while Cisco champions the ''Internet of Everything.'' 
But G.E.'s effort, analysts say, shows that Internet-era technology is ready to sweep through the industrial economy much as the consumer Internet has transformed media, communications and advertising over the last decade.
In recent months, Ms. Paul has donned a hard hat and safety boots to study power plants. She has ridden on a rail locomotive and toured hospital wards. ''Here, you get to work with things that touch people in so many ways,'' she said. ''That was a big draw.''
G.E. is the nation's largest industrial company, a producer of aircraft engines, power plant turbines, rail locomotives and medical imaging equipment. It makes the heavy-duty machinery that transports people, heats homes and powers factories, and lets doctors diagnose life-threatening diseases.
G.E. resides in a different world from the consumer Internet. But the major technologies that animate Google and Facebook are also vital ingredients in the industrial Internet -- tools from artificial intelligence, like machine-learning software, and vast streams of new data. In industry, the data flood comes mainly from smaller, more powerful and cheaper sensors on the equipment.
Smarter machines, for example, can alert their human handlers when they will need maintenance, before a breakdown. It is the equivalent of preventive and personalized care for equipment, with less downtime and more output.
''These technologies are really there now, in a way that is practical and economic,'' said Mark M. Little, G.E.'s senior vice president for global research.
G.E.'s embrace of the industrial Internet is a long-term strategy. But if its optimism proves justified, the impact could be felt across the economy.
The outlook for technology-led economic growth is a subject of considerable debate. In a recent research paper, Robert J. Gordon, a prominent economist at Northwestern University, argues that the gains from computing and the Internet have petered out in the last eight years.
Since 2000, Mr. Gordon asserts, invention has focused mainly on consumer and communications technologies, including smartphones and tablet computers. Such devices, he writes, are ''smaller, smarter and more capable, but do not fundamentally change labor productivity or the standard of living'' in the way that electric lighting or the automobile did.
But others say such pessimism misses the next wave of technology. ''The reason I think Bob Gordon is wrong is precisely because of the kind of thing G.E. is doing,'' said Andrew McAfee, principal research scientist at M.I.T.'s Center for Digital Business.
Today, G.E. is putting sensors on everything, be it a gas turbine or a hospital bed. The mission of the engineers in San Ramon is to design the software for gathering data, and the clever algorithms for sifting through it for cost savings and productivity gains. Across the industries it covers, G.E. estimates such efficiency opportunities at as much as $150 billion.
Some industrial Internet projects are already under way. First Wind, an owner and operator of 16 wind farms in America, is a G.E. customer for wind turbines. It has been experimenting with upgrades that add more sensors, controls and optimization software.
The new sensors measure temperature, wind speeds, location and pitch of the blades. They collect three to five times as much data as the sensors on turbines of a few years ago, said Paul Gaynor, chief executive of First Wind. The data is collected and analyzed by G.E. software, and the operation of each turbine can be tweaked for efficiency. For example, in very high winds, turbines across an entire farm are routinely shut down to prevent damage from rotating too fast. But more refined measurement of wind speeds might mean only a portion of the turbines need to be shut down. In wintry conditions, turbines can detect when they are icing up, and speed up or change pitch to knock off the ice.
Upgrades on 123 turbines on two wind farms have so far delivered a 3 percent increase in energy output, about 120 megawatt hours per turbine a year. That translates to $1.2 million in additional revenue a year from those two farms, Mr. Gaynor said.
''It's not earthshaking, but it is meaningful,'' he said. ''These are real commercial investments for us that make economic sense now.''
For the last few years, G.E. and Mount Sinai Medical Center have been working on a project to optimize the operations of the 1,100-bed hospital in New York. Hospitals, in a sense, are factories of health care. The challenge for hospitals, especially as cost pressures tighten, is to treat more patients more efficiently, while improving the quality of care. Technology, said Wayne Keathley, president of Mount Sinai, can play a vital role.
At Mount Sinai, patients get a black plastic wristband with a location sensor and other information. Similar sensors are on beds and medical equipment. An important advantage, Mr. Keathley said, is to be able to see the daily flow of patients, physical assets and treatment as it unfolds.
But he said the real benefit was how the data could be used to automate and streamline operations and then make better decisions. For example, in a typical hospital, getting a patient who shows up in an emergency room into an assigned bed in a hospital ward can take several hours and phone calls.
At Mount Sinai, G.E. has worked on optimization and modeling software that enables admitting officers to see beds and patient movements throughout the hospital, to help them more efficiently match patients and beds. Beyond that, modeling software is beginning to make predictions about likely patient admission and discharge numbers over the next several hours, based on historical patterns at the hospital and other circumstances -- say, in flu season.
The software, which Mount Sinai has been trying out in recent months, acts as an intelligent assistant to admitting officers. ''It essentially says, 'Hold off, your instinct is to give this bed to that guy, but there might be a better choice,' '' Mr. Keathley explained.
At a hospital like Mount Sinai, G.E. estimates that the optimization and modeling technologies can translate into roughly 10,000 more patients treated a year, and $120 million in savings and additional revenue over several years.
The origins of G.E.'s industrial Internet strategy date back to meetings at the company's headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., in May 2009. In the depths of the financial crisis, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, met with his senior staff to discuss long-term growth opportunities. The industrial Internet, they decided, built on G.E.'s strength in research and could be leveraged across its varied industrial businesses, adding to the company's revenue in services, which reached $42 billion last year.
Now G.E. is trying to rally support for its vision from industry partners, academics, venture capitalists and start-ups. About 250 of them have been invited to a conference in San Francisco, sponsored by the company, on Thursday.
Mr. Immelt himself becomes involved in recruiting. His message, he says, is that if you want to have an effect on major societal challenges like improving health care, energy and transportation, consider G.E.
An early convert was William Ruh, who joined G.E. from Cisco, to become vice president in charge of the software center in San Ramon. And Mr. Ruh is taking the same message to high-tech recruits like Ms. Paul. ''Here, they are working on things they can explain to their parents and grandparents,'' he said. ''It's not a social network,'' even if the G.E. projects share some of the same technology.

HEADLINE: South Korea Is Surprised By Departure Of Candidate

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The millionaire software mogul who was widely seen as a top contender in South Korea's presidential election in December unexpectedly withdrew his candidacy on Friday, throwing his support behind the candidate of the main opposition party who has championed more engagement with North Korea and ''balanced diplomacy'' with Washington and Beijing. South Korea's diplomatic policy is currently weighted more toward the United States.
The surprising move by the software mogul, Ahn Cheol-soo, has turned the campaign for the Dec. 19 election into a close two-way race between Moon Jae-in, the candidate of the liberal opposition Democratic United Party, and Park Geun-hye, the nominee of the governing conservative Saenuri Party. 
Recent surveys predicted that Mr. Ahn, if he became the single candidate representing the liberal South Koreans, would beat Ms. Park, while Mr. Moon would be a much weaker rival against her. But in the same surveys, South Koreans indicated that if Mr. Ahn and Mr. Moon joined forces, voters preferred Mr. Moon as the unified liberal candidate, apparently because of Mr. Ahn's lack of government experience.
The two, who share liberal goals like the narrowing of income inequality and the overhauling of the country's family-controlled and scandal-ridden conglomerates, believed that if both of them ran and split the liberal vote, Ms. Park, their common enemy, would surely win. Ms. Park is the daughter of Park Chung-hee, who established a military dictatorship and ruled South Korea for nearly two decades until his assassination in 1979.
Mr. Ahn and Mr. Moon had been negotiating over who should step aside. Their talks stalled with less than a month left before the election.
But on Friday, Mr. Ahn, 50, an independent, said that he had decided to sacrifice his presidential ambition for the sake of removing the conservatives from power. President Lee Myung-bak, a member of the conservative party, by law cannot seek re-election.
''Now, I will fight as an ordinary foot soldier for a change of governments,'' Mr. Ahn said at a news conference as many of his volunteers sobbed. ''Although I am putting aside my political dream, I really long for a new era and new politics.''
Mr. Ahn, a former physician and university dean, recently became a political star. But critics have voiced concern about his lack of experience in government and politics.
In South Korea, such a gesture of sacrifice by a major candidate like Mr. Ahn is not common. In the presidential race in 1987, two opposition candidates, Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, who hated each other more than their common enemy -- the military dictatorship -- both ran, splitting the vote and helping Roh Tae-woo, the military-backed candidate, win.
''We all owe a huge debt to Mr. Ahn,'' Mr. Moon was quoted as saying by a party spokesman. ''I feel both sorry and grateful to him.''
Although recent polls showed Mr. Moon at a disadvantage to Ms. Park in a two-way race, Mr. Ahn's endorsement was widely expected to improve his chances.
Mr. Moon, 59, a former human rights lawyer, was a close ally of former President Roh Moo-hyun, who stepped down in 2008. Mr. Moon had served in various political posts under Mr. Roh, including as chief of staff.
As a student activist in the 1970s, Mr. Moon was jailed for opposing the dictatorship of Ms. Park's father.
He has vowed to reverse President Lee's policy of linking economic assistance to progress in talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Like other liberals, he sees economic cooperation essential to reconciliation and eventual inter-Korean reunification. He is eager to hold a summit meeting with the North's leader, Kim Jong-un.
South Korea cannot postpone ''balanced diplomacy'' between the region's two biggest powers anymore, Mr. Moon said in a speech this month. ''Our alliance with the United States is being steadily maintained and developing maturely,'' he said, adding, ''The economic relationship between China and us is rapidly growing.''

HEADLINE: Rally Lifts Technology Shares From the Doldrums

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market enjoyed some Black Friday cheer in a holiday-shortened trading session, rising solidly as shoppers braved the annual post-Thanksgiving retail rush. Major stock indexes closed one of their best weeks of the year.
Technology stocks surged after a few weeks of selling. Early reports from retailers suggested strong consumer spending.
''Foot traffic appears heavier than we've seen in recent years, there are a lot of positive statements out of the companies themselves and momentum appears to be strong,'' said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at the brokerage firm TD Ameritrade. 
Many stores opened earlier than ever this year, Mr. Kinahan said, allowing for earlier informal reports about their performance.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 40.30 points, or 1.38 percent, to 2,966.85. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 172.79 points, or 1.35 percent, to 13,009.68, the first time since Election Day that the Dow closed above 13,000.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 18.12 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,409.15. The rally gave the S.& P. 500 its biggest weekly point gain since last December -- 49 points, or 3.6 percent. The Dow industrials gained 3.3 percent and the Nasdaq 4 percent for the week.
Technology stocks jumped sharply. Dell, Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett-Packard were the top three gainers in the S.& P. Technology rose the most among the index's 10 industry groups.
The stocks were bouncing back after a broad decline in confidence in tech stocks, Mr. Kinahan said.
Dell rose 49 cents, or 5.41 percent, to $9.55.
A.M.D. jumped 8 cents, or 4.28 percent, to $1.95. The shares dropped sharply in recent weeks as investors fretted about its solvency.
Shares of H.P. plunged 12 percent on Tuesday after executives said a company that H.P. bought for $10 billion last year lied about its finances. H.P. added 50 cents, or 4.19 percent, to $12.44.
Research in Motion jumped $1.40, or 13.65 percent, to $11.66 on growing optimism for an earlier-than-expected introduction of its delayed BlackBerry 10 smartphone. A senior RIM executive said earlier this month that the company would release the new smartphone ''not long after'' a Jan. 30 event. One analyst saw that as an indication that the products were to be unveiled in February.
Stocks started strong after news that German business confidence rose in November after six consecutive declines.
In the United States, shares of retailers showed strength as shoppers flocked to malls for Black Friday sales, beginning the period in which many retailers turn profitable for the year. Wal-Mart rose $1.31, or 1.9 percent, to $70.20. Macy's gained 72 cents, or 1.76 percent, to $41.73.
MAP Pharmaceuticals rose $2.60, or 20.28 percent, to $15.42, after the company announced that the Food and Drug Administration would review its experimental migraine drug Levadex.
KIT Digital fell $1.33, or 64.3 percent, to 74 cents, after the video software and technology company's former chief executive accused it of blaming previous management for its financial problems. Two days earlier, KIT said it would restate its financial results because of accounting errors.
In the bond market, the price of the 10-year note slipped 4/32, to 99 12/32, while its yield edged up to 1.69 percent from 1.68 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: N.H.L. Scratches More Games and Its All-Star Weekend

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
The N.H.L. announced on Friday the cancellation of another two weeks' worth of games, along with the All-Star Game set for Jan. 27 in Columbus, Ohio. With this latest batch of games and events called off because of the 69-day lockout, the N.H.L. drew nearer to the brink of canceling the season.
The cancellation of games through Dec. 14 brings the total of regular-season games scratched during the lockout to 422, amounting to 34.3 percent of the season. 
The league had already canceled the Jan. 1 Winter Classic in Ann Arbor, Mich., the only N.H.L. regular-season event bigger than its All-Star Game.
The announcement of the canceled games followed the league's rejection of a union offer on Wednesday, as talks between the sides lurched into a 10th week.
The sides did not negotiate Friday, but there was public discussion about the possibility of decertifying the union, a tactic used by the players' unions in the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. during lockouts last year, and advocated Thursday by Buffalo Sabres goalie Ryan Miller.
Decertifying the players' association could allow players to bring an antitrust case against the N.H.L., with the threat that courts may rule the salary cap unlawful in the absence of a union.
On Friday morning on Sportsnet radio in Toronto, Bill Daly, the league's deputy commissioner, called decertification ''a time-consuming process that would likely lead to the end of the season.''
Asked about decertification later on the same station, Steve Fehr, the union's special counsel, said that ''all things are under consideration.''
''The gap that remains on the core economic issues is $182 million,'' Donald Fehr, the executive director of the N.H.L. Players' Association, said in a statement Friday, using the union's estimate of how far apart the sides are in negotiations.
''On Wednesday, N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said that the league is losing $18 million to $20 million per day during the lockout, therefore two more weeks of canceled games far exceeds the current economic gap,'' Fehr said in the statement. ''It makes the N.H.L.'s announcement of further game cancellations, including the 2013 All-Star weekend, all the more unnecessary, and disappointing for all hockey fans -- especially those in Columbus. The players remain ready to negotiate, but we require a willing negotiating partner.''
The N.H.L. characterizes the gap between the sides' proposals as being as much as $900 million.
Bettman's main reason for imposing the lockout, the third of his two-decade tenure as commissioner, is to reduce the players' portion of overall revenue to 50 percent. Under the collective bargaining agreement that expired Sept. 15, the players received 57 percent of revenue.
If the lockout continues and two more weeks of games are canceled, the season will be in jeopardy.
In the first lockout of Bettman's tenure, during the 1994-95 season, the league and the players reached fundamental agreement at the Jan. 10 deadline for cancellation of the season. In the 2004-5 lockout, Bettman announced on Feb. 16 that the season was canceled -- the first, and still the only, major league season in North America to be wiped out by a labor dispute.
The loss of the All-Star Game and its associated events is especially costly to the Blue Jackets, who are estimated to have lost more than $10 million last season and were counting on the All-Star weekend for a financial boost.
The Blue Jackets are one of the money-losing franchises helping to drive the lockout, as teams seek ways to pay less in player salaries.
''The reality of losing more regular-season games as well as the 2013 N.H.L. All-Star Weekend in Columbus is extremely disappointing,'' Daly said in a statement. ''We feel badly for N.H.L. fans and particularly those in Columbus, and we intend to work closely with the Blue Jackets' organization to return the N.H.L. All-Star events to Columbus and their fans as quickly as possible.''

HEADLINE: On Island Largely Blue, An Exception: Trump Tower

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Ford Fessenden, Christopher Maag and Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Its black glass exterior soars high above Fifth Avenue, and its gold-tipped revolving doors have spun the likes of Bruce Willis and Anne Hathaway into its waterfall-splashed atrium.
But on Election Day, Trump Tower earned a different sort of distinction: a tiny island of Romneyville amid Manhattan's deep, blue-state sea.
The tower is in the wealthy precinct where Donald J. Trump, the building's developer and its most recognizable resident, votes. And the electoral district was one of only two in Manhattan where Mitt Romney earned at least 50 percent of the in-person vote. 
But even the presence of Mr. Trump, a ferocious opponent of President Obama who later posted on Twitter that the election was ''a total sham and a travesty,'' could not carry the precinct for his chosen candidate. Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama tied, with 110 votes apiece.
Mr. Romney won a single Manhattan precinct outright, a stretch of Park Avenue near the Waldorf-Astoria, where six voters showed up and four chose the Republican. But he suffered a resounding defeat in New York, a rare outbreak of consensus in a city famous for fevered disagreement: in 91 of the city's 5,286 precincts, Mr. Obama received 100 percent of the vote.
Still, even this most Democratic of cities has its outliers and intrigues. A precinct-by-precinct examination of the ways New Yorkers voted this month revealed some anomalous, and often telling, outcroppings, including pockets of red-state America tucked inside fields of blue.
Take a four-square-block slice of Gravesend, Brooklyn, a warren of high-priced residences dotted with Sephardic temples and yeshivas that happens to be the deepest single bloc of Republican support in all five boroughs. On Election Day, 97 percent of the voters there supported Mr. Romney, who beat Mr. Obama 133 votes to 3. Mr. Romney won unanimously in six other precincts, but altogether, 10 people voted in those precincts.
(These tallies do not include absentee-ballot results, which were not available at the time The New York Times analyzed the vote results.)
On Monday in Gravesend, Jewish men in black hats, clutching prayer books, strolled past manicured lawns and driveways filled with Porsches and Mercedes-Benzes. A Maserati was parked across the street from a rabbinical school on Avenue S. It is a district of families and business owners, residents said, where religious values are often as deeply felt as economic ones.
''There is a perception that Obama is not the best friend of Israel,'' said Ike Hanon, 22, a rabbinical student who lives on East Ninth Street, as he left afternoon prayers. ''He's been catering more to the Muslim countries.''
But his neighbors, Mr. Hanon added, many of whom are entrepreneurs and first- or second-generation immigrants, were equally turned off by what he called the president's ''philosophy of handouts and taking money from the rich.''
''We're more of an upstart type of people,'' Mr. Hanon said. ''We're go-getters. We want someone who really rewards hard work.''
Mr. Romney enjoyed strong support from a range of neighborhoods with large populations of Orthodox Jews, regardless of income level.
Mr. Romney won more than 90 percent of the votes in many precincts in the Borough Park and Sheepshead Bay neighborhoods in Brooklyn and in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens. Some Romney supporters from those areas were surprised to learn their candidate had performed so well.
''I thought I was alone, a voice in the wilderness,'' James Gibbons, a retired technical writer, said as he walked into a kosher supermarket on Avenue S in Brooklyn. He said the support for Mr. Romney was ''terrific, but I wish it was spread out more.''
Other Romney strongholds were on the city's perimeter: Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn; Belle Harbor in the Rockaways; and Howard Beach, Queens. Mr. Romney narrowly missed a victory on Staten Island, traditionally the city's most conservative borough, where Mr. Obama won with 50.2 percent of the vote.
Staten Island may be a swing borough, but Middle Village, Queens, is a swing neighborhood and politically centrist. In 17 precincts in the mostly white, working-class neighborhood, Mr. Obama won by fewer than four percentage points.
Broadly, however, Election Day was a wipeout for the Republican candidate, who earned 18.3 percent of the citywide in-person vote. In some precincts, Mr. Romney was outpolled by Jill Stein, a Green Party candidate who ran a nearly unnoticed campaign. In one section of Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Ms. Stein received 20 votes; Mr. Obama 538; and Mr. Romney zero.
Support for the president was particularly strong in predominantly black neighborhoods, including Harlem, Brownsville, Brooklyn, and parts of southeastern Queens. Across 66 precincts of East New York, Brooklyn, Mr. Romney received 300 votes out of more than 21,000 cast, or about 1.4 percent.
That pattern persisted in many Hispanic neighborhoods. Mr. Obama won 93 percent of the vote in 17 precincts of Washington Heights, a predominantly Dominican area of Upper Manhattan. Of the 91 precincts that handed unanimous victories to Mr. Obama, the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, delivered the highest number of votes: 550 to 0.
''I'm not surprised,'' said Isabella Lee, president of the tenants' association. ''We had a humongous turnout. Some people were in line for an hour; some a little more.''
Octavia Johnson, 29, a lifelong resident of the Whitman Houses, said she arrived at her polling station at 7 a.m. to find ''pandemonium.''
''Everybody was talking about the terrible things Romney was saying; everybody was saying how Romney is not for the inner city and he's not for the poor,'' she said on Tuesday. ''Romney wanted us to continue to struggle. He wanted to make the poor poorer and the rich richer.''
Patricia Heyward, 67, another resident, was pushing a collapsible cart with groceries from the local Costco. The unanimous vote, she said, ''makes me feel good. But zero? That surprises me.'' She laughed. ''We have a lot of black people here, but we also have some white people, and I would think that at least one white person would vote for Romney.''
''But I'm glad nobody did,'' she added.

HEADLINE: Promises on Gun Control

 BODY:
President Obama's fleeting mention of the need for stronger gun controls at a presidential debate last month was hardly the kind of forceful political statement needed to address the scourge of gun violence in this country. Even his tepid remark was considered by the nation's gun owners as a threat to take away their firearms. In what amounts to a buyers' panic, they are again ramping up gun and ammunition sales as they did four years ago, convinced that Mr. Obama intends a gun-control crackdown. 
Yet in his first term, Mr. Obama did nothing to cross the gun lobby, and he actually signed legislation allowing loaded firearms to be carried in national parks. Let's hope Mr. Obama shows more courage on guns in his second term. He said during the debate that he would see ''if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced'' and that we need to look at ''other sources of the violence,'' like ''cheap handguns.'' Now it's time to follow through on those promises.
Wary politicians, including Mr. Obama, will issue statements of mourning for the victims in mass shootings, which seem to happen ever more frequently. But they refuse to say much about 30,000 American lives that are lost each year because of shootings.
Horrific incidents like the massacre in July at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and murder of six others in Tucson last year produced vows in Congress to screen the mentally ill more effectively and to ban battlefield clips of 100 rounds of ammunition that have no place in a civilized country. But there have been more than 60 multiple shooting incidents since the Tucson shooting, and nothing has been done to make such killings less likely in the future.
Mr. Obama talked about starting ''a broader conversation'' about reducing gun violence. The best place to start is in Congress, which has been grossly negligent toward constituent safety for the past 20 years as it bows to the demands of the gun lobby.
The lobby's defense of unregistered and untracked gun sales at black market flea markets and weekend gun shows is strongly opposed by Americans in opinion polls. In fact, four out of five gun owners see the wisdom of checking on anonymous sellers and buyers.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who was a principal in the 1994 enactment of a 10-year ban on civilian use of assault rifles, intends to propose its reinstatement. ''Weapons of war do not belong on our streets, in our classrooms, in our schools or in our movie theaters,'' she said after the Aurora killings. This bill affords President Obama an opportunity to follow through on his 2008 campaign promise to work to revive the ban.
Mr. Obama is free of the pressures of campaigning -- and free to lead the nation toward sensible laws that can help reduce the flood of guns and related homicides.
The need for strong leadership on this issue is growing as statehouse politicians cave to ever more lethal demands from the gun lobby. State laws allowing students to go armed to class in Colorado, freeing owners in Oklahoma to wear holstered weapons in public, and letting people ''stand your ground'' in Florida and a score of other states have already damaged public safety immeasurably.

HEADLINE: Cost-Cutting Cited in Loose Plane Seats

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
Last month, American Airlines grounded dozens of Boeing 757 airliners after passenger seats came loose on four flights. Just a few weeks earlier, another American plane, a Boeing 767, was grounded after a problem was reported with the installation of some seats, though in that case no seats actually came loose.
Why the seat problems? 
American, like other carriers, is in the midst of reconfiguring its coach section to give more leg room to some economy seats. To get the extra space, it is creating three rows instead of four. The airline then charges more for the seats, which it calls Main Cabin Extra.
But the airline, in trying to cut costs during bankruptcy, hired outside maintenance companies this summer for the first time to modify its cabins. And airline documents show that those workers did not understand how to properly install the seats.
The Federal Aviation Administration has opened an investigation into the seat problems.
The airline has acknowledged that it is ultimately responsible for the quality of work done on its planes, whether by its workers or outside contractors. ''All U.S. airlines are required to monitor maintenance work at the vendor work site, regardless of where the contractors are located,'' said Andrea Huguely, a spokeswoman for the airline. ''We have employees on site at any facility that performs maintenance on our aircraft.''
The union argued that American's switch from its own unionized mechanics was putting passengers at risk. ''You can't have just anyone doing that maintenance,'' said Larry Pike, president of the Transportation Workers Union Local 567, which represents the airline's mechanics. ''You can't pull over in the sky and fix something if you hear something go thump.''
The airline countered that it never put passenger safety at risk. ''We never have -- and never will -- compromise the safety and reliability of our fleet,'' Ms. Huguely said.
But since October, it has offered an evolving set of explanations for the seat problem, blaming first the clamp used to hold the seats in place and later an accumulation of soda and dirt in the seat tracks that prevented the clamp from locking properly. It now says that a part ''did not work the way it was designed to work,'' though the airline said in an advisory to mechanics that a contributing factor was the ''incorrect installation of the seat to the seat track.''
Ms. Huguely defended the use of contract workers as necessary if the airline was to remain competitive. ''Our competitors have forged a path of having their maintenance completed where it is most cost-effective,'' she said. ''We must similarly adapt.''
The F.A.A. is looking into whether the contractors' work was properly supervised by American, according to several people with knowledge of the investigation. It is also investigating the rewiring of arm rest controls and the relocation of overhead lights and oxygen masks -- which had to be done along with moving the seats -- because some of that work was not done correctly, these people said.
Although the four flights with loose seats made news in October, the airline already knew that one of its contractors had had trouble installing seats. That contractor, Certified Aviation Services of San Diego, was hired to work on Boeing 767s. It told American on Aug. 28 that it might have installed seats incorrectly.
Ms. Huguely said, ''The issue with the first aircraft was discovered as soon as C.A.S. began work on the second aircraft.'' The first plane was grounded in Montevideo, Uruguay, until it could be fixed, according to a document outlining the internal investigation that American conducted afterward.
In its review, American wrote that workers ''misinterpreted'' the aircraft maintenance manual. ''The entire C.A.S. vendor crew was coached and counseled'' on Sept. 4 about the importance of asking for help when there is doubt about how to accomplish a task, the report said.
But the same issue came up again on Sept. 26, when a seat came loose on an American 757 on a flight from Dallas to Vail, Colo. In that case, the work had been done by a second contractor, Timco of Greensboro, N.C. In Vail, Kip Blakely, vice president of industry and government relations at Timco, told The Greensboro News & Record, the seat was tightened and the plane flew on to Boston. ''The same seat was loose again,'' he said. ''American fixed it.'' It went from Boston to Miami, and the seat came loose again. According to Mr. Blakely, ''That's when the pilot declared an emergency'' and made an unscheduled landing at Kennedy Airport in New York.
Rollie Reaves, a union mechanic at American, said after the problem was found at Certified Aviation Services in August, maintenance supervisors should have told all workers about the issue. ''They should have printed a maintenance alert and hung it in a work area,'' he said. But it was not until Oct. 15, he said, that mechanics were warned that seat fasteners could appear to be secure even when they were not.
Both Certified Aviation Services and Timco are well-established airplane maintenance companies, and Timco's Web site indicates that part of its business comes from installation of airplane seats. Both companies work for other airlines as well as American.
In an e-mail, Leonard Kazmerski, a vice president at Timco, said technicians in Boston ''properly installed the seats on the aircraft'' and that ''the seats were inspected by certified technicians.'' Asked for further specifics, he said in an e-mail, ''We are going to honor our agreement with AA and not address details about work we perform for them.''
Officials at Certified Aviation did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Some of the Boeing 757 installation work at Timco in Boston was done by students at National Aviation Academy in Bedford, Mass.
American and Timco defended the use of students to do work on airliners. ''Physicians use nonmedical-degreed personnel to perform certain tasks, providing learning and development opportunities, but the doctor oversees their work,'' Mr. Kazmerski said.
The F.A.A. licenses mechanics but does not require a license to work on airliners. It allows anyone deemed qualified by their employer to work under the supervision of a licensed mechanic. The plane must also be inspected before it can be returned to service.

HEADLINE: With Stickers, a Petition and Even a Middle Name, Secession Fever Hits Texas

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- In the weeks since President Obama's re-election, Republicans around the country have been wondering how to proceed. Some conservatives in Texas have been asking a far more pointed question: how to secede.
Secession fever has struck parts of Texas, which Mitt Romney won by nearly 1.3 million votes. 
Sales of bumper stickers reading ''Secede'' -- one for $2, or three for $5 -- have increased at TexasSecede.com. In East Texas, a Republican official sent out an e-mail newsletter saying it was time for Texas and Vermont to each ''go her own way in peace'' and sign a free-trade agreement among the states.
A petition calling for secession that was filed by a Texas man on a White House Web site has received tens of thousands of signatures, and the Obama administration must now issue a response. And Larry Scott Kilgore, a perennial Republican candidate from Arlington, a Dallas suburb, announced that he was running for governor in 2014 and would legally change his name to Larry Secede Kilgore, with Secede in capital letters. As his Web page, secedekilgore.com, puts it: ''Secession! All other issues can be dealt with later.''
In Texas, talk of secession in recent years has steadily shifted to the center from the fringe right. It has emerged as an echo of the state Republican leadership's anti-Washington, pro-Texas-sovereignty mantra on a variety of issues, including health care and environmental regulations. For some Texans, the renewed interest in the subject serves simply as comic relief after a crushing election defeat.
But for other proponents of secession and its sister ideology, Texas nationalism -- a focus of the Texas Nationalist Movement and other groups that want the state to become an independent nation, as it was in the 1830s and 1840s -- it is a far more serious matter.
The official in East Texas, Peter Morrison, the treasurer of the Hardin County Republican Party, said in a statement that he had received overwhelming support from conservative Texans and overwhelming opposition from liberals outside the state in response to his comments in his newsletter. He said that it may take time for ''people to appreciate that the fundamental cultural differences between Texas and other parts of the United States may be best addressed by an amicable divorce, a peaceful separation.''
The online petitions -- created on the We the People platform at petitions.whitehouse.gov -- are required to receive 25,000 signatures in 30 days for the White House to respond. The Texas petition, created Nov. 9 by a man identified as Micah H. of Arlington, had received more than 116,000 signatures by Friday. It asks the Obama administration to ''peacefully grant'' the withdrawal of Texas, and describes doing so as ''practically feasible,'' given the state's large economy.
Residents in other states, including Alabama, Florida, Colorado, Louisiana and Oklahoma, have submitted similar petitions, though none have received as many signatures as the one from Texas.
A White House official said every petition that crossed the signature threshold would be reviewed and would receive a response, though it was unclear precisely when Micah H. would receive his answer.
Gov. Rick Perry, who twice made public remarks in 2009 suggesting that he was sympathetic to the secessionist cause, will not be signing the petition. ''Governor Perry believes in the greatness of our union, and nothing should be done to change it,'' a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said in a statement. ''But he also shares the frustrations many Americans have with our federal government.''
The secession movement in Texas is divergent, with differences in goals and tactics. One group, the Republic of Texas, says that secession is unnecessary because, it claims, Texas is an independent nation that was illegally annexed by the United States in 1845. (The group's leader and other followers waged a weeklong standoff with the Texas Rangers in 1997 that left one of its members dead.) Mr. Kilgore, the candidate who is changing his middle name, said he had not signed the White House petition because he did not believe that Texans needed to ask Washington for permission to leave.
''Our economy is about 30 percent larger than that of Australia,'' said Mr. Kilgore, 48, a telecommunications contractor. ''Australia can survive on their own, and I don't think we'll have any problem at all surviving on our own in Texas.''
Few of the public calls for secession have addressed the messy details, like what would happen to the state's many federal courthouses, prisons, military bases and parklands. No one has said what would become of Kevin Patteson, the director of the state's Office of State-Federal Relations, and no one has asked the Texas residents who received tens of millions of dollars in federal aid after destructive wildfires last year for their thoughts on the subject.
But all the secession talk has intrigued liberals as well. Caleb M. of Austin started his own petition on the White House Web site. He asked the federal government to allow Austin to withdraw from Texas and remain part of the United States, ''in the event that Texas is successful in the current bid to secede.'' It had more than 8,000 signatures as of Friday.

HEADLINE: Rising Consumer Optimism Fuels an Annual Spree

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Reporting was contributed by Christina Capecchi from Eagan, Minn.; Christopher Maag from Columbus, Ohio; Cindy Wolff from Memphis; and Rebecca Fairley Raney from Upland, Calif.

 BODY:
Worries about the economy and fiscal austerity be damned. On Black Friday, consumers were ready to shop till they dropped. And some even did, dozing off on the furniture displays in department stores offering predawn deals.
Consumers have voiced increasing optimism in recent months as employment rises and their home values (finally) go up, or at least stabilize, even as government talks about taxes and spending remain at an impasse. Bargain hunters put that upbeat mood into action on Thursday night and the wee hours of Friday morning at department and discount stores around the country.
Shoppers stood in line Friday for the 7 a.m. opening of Sam's Club in Eagan, Minn., enduring freezing temperatures and biting winds, and clinging to free Starbuck's Holiday Blend coffee as they collected vouchers for laptops and big-screen TVs.
''I didn't even want it,'' Meshia Flood, 36, a student from nearby Eagan, told a worker standing near the exit, referring to the 40-inch Sanyo LED TV on her cart. She and her 13-year-old daughter had come for a 96-cent Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone, but did not snag one before they disappeared minutes after opening. 
Hundreds to thousands of consumers lined up outside Sears, Target, Macy's, Old Navy and other retailers offering time-sensitive deals. Some turned up Thursday night for newly extended hours that some merchants have been experimenting with.
Bryan Everett, Target's senior vice president for stores, said that Target's decision to open at 9 p.m. on Thursday rather than midnight meant that there were more families in the store, and that customers stayed longer.
''Usually, it's just a parent with a child, or mom and dad, or just a single guest in the store,'' he said. ''This year, we were seeing four- to five-person families.''
As a result, he said, customers stayed longer, and there was more ''cross shopping.'' Usually the Black Friday shoppers make a beeline for the electronics and toys, he said, but this year in addition to the surge in big-screen LCD TVs, iPads, iPods and Xboxes ''we saw a nice pattern of shopping in the apparel and home departments.'' Children's pajamas, blankets, sheet sets, pillows and scarves all did particularly well.
The official sales numbers will not be reported for a few days, but analysts are expecting a strong sales day, with results comparable with last year's gain of about 3 percent, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which is a metric for total American retail sales across all payment forms, including cash and check. The earlier hours from a few select chains seem unlikely to increase the size of the spending pie, but they may reapportion it.
''Black Friday has always been and always will be about being first: first to open, first to price, first to offer that special item,'' said Michael Brown, a partner in the retail practice of A. T. Kearney, a global management consulting firm.
He said the race to open earlier and earlier would probably continue in coming years, although there was some question about how early was too early. Some Midtown Manhattan stores that were open at midday on Thursday did not seem to get blockbuster traffic, at least compared with the postdinner doorbusters.
In addition to longer hours, stores also experimented with ways to slow the creep of online competitors onto their turf and prevent consumers from using brick-and-mortar locations as showrooms for the goods they planned to purchase online.
Best Buy, Target, Fry's Electronics and Staples all agreed to match prices with at least some online competitors. Physical stores may also benefit from decisions by some states to force online retailers to pay sales taxes. That is chipping away at the pricing edge of some major companies like Amazon.com, according to Nelson Granados, an assistant professor at the Graziadio School of Business and Management at Pepperdine University.
Analysts and investors pay a lot of attention to figures and anecdotes from the first shopping day of the holiday season, hoping that they will provide some insight into the consumer psyche and, by extension, the overall economy. Consumer spending, after all, represents about 70 percent of total economic output, and Black Friday is the most hyped shopping day of the year.
But it is not clear how much Black Friday activity actually reveals about the underlying health of the economy, or even about how much consumers are going to spend in the subsequent weeks.
''History suggests that strong sales on Black Friday tend to be followed by weak sales over the rest of the holidays and that weak sales on Black Friday tend to be followed by strong sales later on,'' Paul Dales, senior United States economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. He added that the overall relationship between sales during Thanksgiving week and sales over the entire holiday season was weak.
''This would make sense if people have a fixed amount of cash that they allocate to either Black Friday or the rest of the holidays,'' he said. ''Good Black Friday sales may then just mean that households have brought forward some of their holiday spending.''
Vendors in the Northeast had the early part of their holiday shopping season clipped by Hurricane Sandy, and so are trying to reel in as much spending as they can in the coming weeks.
''The good news is there's more days this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas than there usually is,'' said Terry Lundgren, the chief executive of Macy's, which closed over 200 stores for the first three days of the month because of the storm. He said the company would be staggering its discount deals more evenly throughout the coming weeks, rather than waiting until the week before Christmas, to give shoppers reasons to come more regularly.
There is also one more full weekend between the holidays this year than there was last year, which analysts say could also increase spending.
''There are more opportunities to go out there and shop, and although that won't impact what people are planning to buy, they will probably end up picking up more impulse items like jewelry or apparel for themselves,'' Mr. Brown said.
While lines snaked around cash registers across the country, consumers were not uniformly optimistic. In areas where consumer confidence is low, shoppers stressed that they had participated in the Black Friday frenzy precisely because they needed to save as much money as they could, not because they were eager to spend.
Laura and Dan Schimpf stood in line at a Best Buy in Columbus, Ohio, at 2 o'clock in the morning Friday and listed the compromises that had brought them there. There were small ones, like avoiding all restaurants and movie theaters for the last six months to save money for holiday shopping. And there were larger ones, like driving two cars with a combined 392,000 miles on the odometers, and having just one son when they had always dreamed of two.
Let other people talk of recovery and brighter futures. Despite their steady paychecks, Mr. and Mrs. Schimpf see uncertain times behind and ahead.
''I feel like we're doing a little better, but I don't put a lot of weight on that because it all might be smoke and mirrors,'' said Mrs. Schimpf, 32, who works for Ohio's state government. ''We have to watch out for the next disaster.''

HEADLINE: UBS Expected to Be Fined In Rogue Trader Scandal

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - UBS is expected to face a multimillion-dollar fine in connection with the $2.3 billion trading loss caused by a former trader, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
The potential fine by British authorities against the Swiss bank may be £30 million to £50 million, or $47 million to $80 million, and could be announced as early as next week, according to one person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
On Tuesday, the former UBS trader Kweku M. Adoboli received a seven-year jail sentence on two counts of fraud in connection with the loss for abusing his position at the Swiss bank from 2008 to 2011. Mr. Adoboli was found not guilty on another four counts of false accounting.
The Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority opened a joint inquiry last year into the enormous trading loss. On behalf of the regulators, the accounting firm KPMG conducted a $20 million investigation into the internal failures at the Swiss bank that led to Mr. Adoboli's trading loss.
The potential penalty could be one of the largest fines levied by the Financial Services Authority of Britain. The regulator fined the British bank Barclays £59.5 million this year in connection with the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. JPMorgan Chase was also penalized £33.3 million in 2010 for failing to protect British clients' money from 2002 to 2009.
The Swiss regulator, which cannot levy fines, is expected to announce its own recommendations. Proposals could include stricter supervision for UBS in the near term.
UBS has dealt with a series of scandals since the financial crisis.
In 2009, the Swiss firm paid $780 million to settle allegations by American authorities that it helped wealthy clients evade United States taxes. The bank paid an £8 million fine to British regulators that year after an employee in the firm's London-based wealth management unit carried out unauthorized trades with clients' money. UBS also was forced to write down credit investments worth around $50 billion from 2007 to 2008.
In a bid to reduce its exposure to risky trading, the Swiss bank announced plans last month to eliminate up to 10,000 jobs in its investment banking unit. Last year, UBS announced a separate batch of 3,500 job cuts.
Sergio P. Ermotti, the bank's chief executive, is refocusing the firm's resources on its profitable wealth management unit, while responding to stricter regulatory capital requirements that has reduced the profitability of certain trading areas.
Up to 45 percent of the newly announced layoffs, or 4,500 people, are expected to be in London. A further 2,500 job losses will come from its Swiss operations, while the remaining layoffs would be borne by UBS's division in the United States.
Shares in UBS rose less than 1 percent in morning trading in Zurich on Friday.
Spokesmen for UBS and the Financial Services Authority declined to comment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Zealand Wants a Hollywood Put on Its Map

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Standing by his desk in New Zealand's distinctive round Parliament building, known locally as the Beehive, Prime Minister John Key proudly brandished an ornately engraved sword. It was used, he said, by Frodo Baggins, the protagonist of the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, and in the films it possesses magical powers that cause it to glow blue in the presence of goblins.
''This was given to me by the president of the United States,'' said Mr. Key, marveling that President Obama's official gift to New Zealand was, after all, a New Zealand product.
In Mr. Key's spare blond-wood office -- with no goblins in sight -- the sword looked decidedly unmagical. But it served as a reminder that in New Zealand, the business of running a country goes hand in hand with the business of making movies. 
For better or worse, Mr. Key's government has taken extreme measures that have linked its fortunes to some of Hollywood's biggest pictures, making this country of 4.4 million people, slightly more than the city of Los Angeles, a grand experiment in the fusion of film and government.
That union has been on enthusiastic display here in recent weeks as ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,'' the first of three related movies by the director Peter Jackson, approached its world premiere on Wednesday in Wellington (and on Dec. 14 in the United States). Anticipation in New Zealand has been building, and there are signs everywhere of the film's integration into Kiwi life -- from the giant replica of the movie's Gollum creature suspended over the waiting area at Wellington Airport to the gift shops that are expanding to meet anticipated demand for Hobbit merchandise (elf ears, $14).
But the path to this moment has been filled with controversy. Two years ago, when a dispute with unions threatened to derail the ''Hobbit'' movies -- endangering several thousand jobs and a commitment of some $500 million by Warner Brothers -- Mr. Key persuaded the Parliament to rewrite its national labor laws.
It was a breathtaking solution, even in a world accustomed to generous public support of movie projects, and a substantial incentive package was included: the government agreed to contribute $99 million in production costs and add $10 million to the studio's marketing budget. And its tourism office will spend about $8 million in its current fiscal year, and probably more in the future, as part of a promotional campaign with Time Warner that is marketing the country as a film-friendly fantasyland.
For a tiny nation like New Zealand, where plans to cut $35 million from the education budget set off national outrage earlier this year (and a backtrack from the government), the ''Hobbit'' concessions were difficult for many to swallow, especially since the country had already provided some $150 million in support for the three ''Lord of the Rings'' movies.
Now, even amid the excitement of the ''Hobbit'' opening, skepticism about the government's film-centric strategy remains. And recently it has become entangled with new suspicions: that Mr. Key's government is taking cues from America's powerful film industry in handling a request by United States officials for the extradition of Kim Dotcom, the mogul whose given name was Kim Schmitz, so he can face charges of pirating copyrighted material.
New Zealand's political scene erupted in September, as Mr. Key publicly apologized to Mr. Dotcom for what turned out to be illegal spying on him by the country's Government Communications Security Bureau. The Waikato Times, a provincial paper, taunted Mr. Key, accusing him of making New Zealand the ''51st state,'' while others suggested that a whirlwind trip by Mr. Key to Los Angeles in early October was somehow tied to the Dotcom case.
''No studio executive raised it with me,'' Mr. Key said in an interview last month. He spoke the day after a private dinner where he lobbied executives from Disney, Warner Brothers, Fox and other companies for still more New Zealand film work, with Mr. Jackson, a New Zealander, joining by video link.
Mr. Key has been sharply criticized for cozying up to Mr. Jackson in what some consider unseemly ways. Last year, a month before elections in which he and his National Party were fighting to keep control of the government, Mr. Key skipped an appointment with Queen Elizabeth II in Australia to visit the Hobbiton set. He also interviewed Mr. Jackson on a radio show, prompting an outcry from the opposition.
Pro-union forces remain predictably outraged. Phil Darkins, a vice president of Actors Equity in New Zealand, calls his country the ''only Western democracy on the planet where professional performers have virtually no rights,'' and his group has continued to seek an overall agreement with producers.
Mr. Darkins, in a recent e-mail, also objected to immigration law changes that allow foreign film workers into the country for brief periods without review by local worker groups, calling it ''a virtual open-door policy.''
The opposition Labour Party, while backing the government's support for the film industry, has chafed at what it views as the ''Warner Brothers-specific'' concessions made by Mr. Key.
''We wouldn't move the crossbar for any individual company,'' said Trevor Mallard, a Labour leader, in an interview in Wellington last June.
And even as the ''Hobbit'' films, years in the making, approached their debut, Mr. Key could not predict when a next major film would follow.
''It's too early to say,'' he said.
An Economic Engine
Nowhere is filmmaking big enough to move a national economy. But in New Zealand, add movies to another business -- tourism -- and there is potential for transformative economic growth.
That's the strategy Mr. Key's government has pursued. The making of feature films and television shows generated only about $1.1 billion in revenue last year, well under 1 percent of a gross domestic product of roughly $160 billion. About 17 percent of movie and television revenue is directly subsidized by the national government, which spent nearly $200 million to support movies last year.
But tourism is an economic sector 20 times the size of the country's movie and television production business. And as other countries, notably China, have moved into some of New Zealand's core dairy industry, the Kiwis, a particularly inventive people, have focused more on the vacation market.
The thinking: Movies may draw visitors who are not up to the rigors of bungee-jumping, zorbing (which involves rolling downhill inside a plastic ball) or other rigorous outdoor sports that are tourism mainstays.
In an unusual arrangement, Mr. Key, a former currency trader with Merrill Lynch who did graduate work at Harvard, retains a portfolio as his government's tourism minister. Scratching for solutions to the 2010 crisis with unions over ''The Hobbit,'' he settled on a policy that would, in effect, use much of the tourism budget to re-brand the country as Middle-earth, hoping to lure visitors to locations where Mr. Jackson has shot and is shooting his films.
Still, it's a sizable gamble considering the potential pitfalls. There is no guarantee that moviegoers will embrace the ''Hobbit'' films with the same fervor as the ''Rings'' trilogy. Those films had combined worldwide ticket sales of about $3 billion (in 2012 dollars, after adjusting for inflation). Warner and its New Line Cinema unit, both of which declined to comment for this article, have high hopes for the movies, which also have backing from MGM.
Other big questions remain, starting with Mr. Jackson's decision to shoot the films at 48 frames a second, twice the usual rate, in search of new visual heights; early reaction to the result has been sharply mixed. Then there is the capricious nature of the filmmaking business, which has become increasingly mobile and will quickly flee to the national or local government offering the best incentives.
Exchange rates play a sizable part in the bidding process. Favorable rates were one reason Mr. Jackson and his partners were able to build New Zealand into a crossroads for special effects and postproduction work, the kind of business that George Lucas once cornered in Northern California. ''Avatar,'' ''Marvel's The Avengers,'' ''The Adventures of Tintin'' and ''Prometheus'' are among the many films that have crossed through Mr. Jackson's Wellington-based effects shop, Weta Digital, on their way to theaters.
But recently a stronger New Zealand dollar, which currently trades for about 82 cents in United States currency, has eroded its cost advantage for North American companies, something that other countries are trying to exploit. Northern Ireland now claims to be the ''new New Zealand,'' while Serbia says it is ''New Zealand, but cheaper,'' notes Gisella Carr, the chief executive of Film New Zealand, an industry group that scours the globe for film work.
Hollywood is also looking to China, where an aggressive government and its allied companies are building expensive movie facilities and offering access to a vast market in exchange for a stake in American studio pictures.
New Zealand does have language in its favor, since the crews speak English. It also has a ''just do it'' approach that endears it to studios. ''We're not afraid,'' said Tim Coddington, an Auckland-based producer who worked on the ''Chronicles of Narnia'' fantasies in New Zealand. Still, for Mr. Key and others, the primary challenge remains linked tightly to Mr. Jackson: how do you build a significant and enduring economic sector from a local business dominated by one man?
''Peter Jackson might make movies for the next 50 years, or he might not,'' said Mr. Key. ''You can't base an industry solely on one person. That's a very vulnerable business strategy.''
The Native Son
Inside one of four soundstages at his Stone Street Studios, located near Wellington Airport, Peter Jackson stood among several dozen extras and delivered a pep talk. It was mid-June, and the scene involved villagers headed to battle. ''Hold those weapons like you plan to use them,'' he commanded.
A disheveled, soft-spoken 51-year-old, he is accustomed to being in the thick of things. If Mr. Lucas and his ''Star Wars''-born effects companies developed an outsize presence in Marin County in California, Mr. Jackson in many ways dominates a whole country.
When he decided to use 12 hilly acres of a remote sheep farm as his ''Hobbit'' village, a New Zealand army convoy arrived the next morning to build a series of access roads to the site. ''We couldn't believe it,'' said Russell Alexander, an owner of the farmland. ''This guy has command of our army?''
Smaller filmmakers say the priority given to big productions like Mr. Jackson's has hurt the independent community. In Auckland, where an independent film culture once thrived, Mr. Jackson is acidly referred to by less-favored members of the industry as ''Sir Peter,'' emphasizing the honorific he received in 2010.
Mr. Jackson, who grew up in the village of Pukerua Bay, played down his stature during an interview inside his modestly furnished office. ''My business empire? That's an awfully grandiose term,'' he said in response to a question.
He disagreed with the notion that New Zealand's film industry rested squarely on his shoulders. ''If I started to think like that my head would explode,'' he said. ''I can't take responsibility for everyone's employment.''
New Zealand was notably not kind to Mr. Jackson at the outset of his career. But little by little, he clawed his way forward, pouring his own money into his films and ultimately buying an old paint factory as a studio base when he was starting the ''Rings'' trilogy.
''It was mothballed, covered in dust, dark, dingy and cold,'' Mr. Jackson said of the complex. ''We were going to be up to our eyeballs in debt if we bought it.''
But as he toured the grounds with Fran Walsh, an Oscar-winning screenwriter and producer who is Mr. Jackson's partner in life and in business, an omen appeared. Someone had left behind an old paperback book -- ''The Lord of the Rings.''
''We looked at each other and said, 'We'll take it,' '' Mr. Jackson said.
The paint factory formed part of Stone Street Studios, which is laid out around a courtyard and includes departments like wardrobe and makeup and the four soundstages, two of them sophisticated enough to allow Mr. Jackson to construct a rushing river inside, as ''Hobbit'' scenes required.
A few blocks away is Weta Digital, which employs over a thousand graphic artists, technicians and support staff when operating at full tilt, and has taken over four buildings, one of which is a former ice cream factory. Sprawling a couple of streets away is Mr. Jackson's postproduction facility, complete with apartments, so directors never have to leave, and a lavishly decorated theater, a copy of one at the Hearst Castle in California.
Also nearby is the 300-employee Weta Workshop, which builds props, designs film-related merchandise and fills orders for privately commissioned ''toys'' for rich collectors -- like a full-size working Panzer tank.
''It's all an endeavor to create sustainable work for us,'' said Richard Taylor, a five-time Oscar winner for visual effects, makeup and costumes who co-owns much of Mr. Jackson's moviemaking operation and runs Weta Workshop. ''Our fortunes are dictated by the world's creative industries, and that puts us in a very nervous place a lot of the time.''
The collection of companies now takes up so much square footage in Wellington's Miramar neighborhood that it has been given a nickname: Wellywood.
An Illusion's Staying Power
Whether movies are a matter of political life and death for Mr. Key remains open to debate. He strongly challenged the notion that he might have lost the 2011 election had ''The Hobbit'' been lost. ''Definitely not,'' he said.
Things got tense for him during the campaign, however, after he interviewed Mr. Jackson in September 2011 on a radio talk show called ''The PM's Hour.'' New Zealand's Electoral Commission declared that the interview violated laws barring broadcasters from providing a candidate with free publicity close to an election, but a full-blown scandal was averted when police officials decided in March not to prosecute the radio service. Still, Labour politicians were unappeased, and blamed Mr. Key. ''It was a political stunt, and he should have taken responsibility for that,'' Labour's deputy leader, Grant Robertson, said in a statement.
Nor did Mr. Jackson's gilded image escape untarnished in the turmoil over the dealings with Warner. In June 2011, a periodic survey of the ''most trusted'' people in New Zealand found that Mr. Jackson had plunged 68 slots, to No. 74.
The question facing both Mr. Key and Mr. Jackson is whether overseas travelers will be attracted to a deliberate illusion that blurs the line between New Zealand and its films. It worked once before: the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, featuring lavish photography of volcanoes, waterfalls and sharp-peaked mountain ranges, prompted a surge of visitors. ''I don't mean to sound mercenary, but at this point, it's not about the films, it's about New Zealand,'' said Kevin Bowler, the chief executive of Tourism New Zealand.
As Mr. Bowler spoke in June, about two dozen workers at computer screens in an office overlooking the Wellington harbor were proliferating a Web and poster campaign. As ''Lord of the Rings'' tourism peaked in recent years, about 6 percent of international visitors to New Zealand, or roughly 150,000 people, cited the films as a reason for coming; 11,200 said it was their only reason. Given the movie world's increasing appetite for fantasy, however, Mr. Bowler predicted that the payoff from Mr. Jackson's new films would be larger.
Already, plans are in place to close streets in central Wellington for a day and a half to accommodate a throng of perhaps 100,000 expected to gather outside the premiere at the Embassy theater, which has been updated so that it can handle the film's high-speed format.
Mr. Jackson's staff at Weta, in the meantime, has been busy redecorating the country, including placing fanciful, Weta-designed ''bandages'' on the fuselage of Wellington's air ambulance.
Here in Wellington, Mr. Key explained, ''Peter is a very, very big fish in quite a small tank.''

HEADLINE: A Meta Modeling Meditation

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Models are good for your soul. 

 BODY:
I'm still thinking about the whole "America could only give workers decent living standards when it didn't face competition" discussion. For one thing, this is an old favorite discussion of mine; the "growth and trade" literature goes back more than 60 years, but there aren't, I think, many prominent economists working today who know much about that tradition, so I may be the last of the Mohicans or something. For another, this subject is a perfect illustration of the important of actually having a model - I'll explain in a minute what I mean by that. And one more point: what we learn from this story is that a model may be created to answer one question, or defend a particular position, but if it's a good model it can be used in multiple settings, and sometimes may even end up supporting a different side in the political debate. 
So, on the first point: the origins of this literature go back to the immediate postwar years, when it was common to argue that US technological superiority made it impossible for Europe to compete. Yet basic trade theory says that trade depends on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage - you can gain from trade even if you're less productive across the board, simply by concentrating on the areas in which your productivity lags least. Did the "dollar shortage" argument make any sense in that framework?
Enter John Hicks, who rephrased it not as a question about gains from trade but as a question about the effects of technological progress in your trading partners. And he laid out a rudimentary model to address that question.
Some readers asked, what do I mean by a "model"? The answer is, I'm pretty generous on that front - it could be solved equations, it could be a computer simulation, it could be a physical apparatus like the Phillips hydraulic Keynesian model, or it could just be a carefully written verbal discussion like Hume's essay on the balance of trade. What makes it a model is that however it's presented, it involves a careful discussion of micromotives and macrobehavior - that is, it describes what individuals are doing (not necessarily out of perfect rationality), and how that individual behavior adds up to some aggregate outcome. Crucially, it's not just a set of slogans.
Now, having a model is no guarantee of being right - real business cycle theory certainly fits my definition, but I believe that it offers a fundamentally wrong account of what recessions are all about. Still, writing down a model rules out certain kinds of error, the kind that come from not thinking about things add up. Most of the bad reasoning on the postwar situation comes from an almost ridiculous error - forgetting that not having competitors doesn't help if you also don't have any customers. Having a model lets you avoid that sort of thing.
What the Hicks analysis and later versions (notably Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson (pdf)) tells us is that technological progress in other countries can either help or hurt you, depending on which industries are affected; it also tells you to look at the terms of trade, which in practice means that it turns out to be a smaller issue than many people imagine.
What's interesting about this analysis from a political point of view is that more or less the same model has served different causes at different times. In postwar Europe, Hicks-type analysis was a corrective people arguing against market economies open to trade; it was, if you like, a helpful support to free-marketeers. In the early 1990s, I and other used this kind of analysis to counter both left-of-center demands for protectionism and corporate-welfare arguments for subsidies to fight Japan and all that. Yet right now the analysis turns out to be useful mainly to counter right-wing claims that the experience of America in the 50s and 60s, when good wages and progressive taxation went hand in hand with rapid growth, can be dismissed by appealing to the lack of international competition.
The point is that a helpful economic model is not a propaganda slogan, to be discarded whenever the party line changes. It is, instead, a structure that can be used to improve your understanding in many contexts.
Oh, and the best answer to "gotcha" attempts to debunk economists - "Ha! You said just the opposite in 2003!" - is to ask whether and how the economist's model has changed. If he is using the same model, but it's one that has different policy implications in different situations, you've just done a gotcha on yourself. If he has changed his model, the question is why, and whether there were good reasons for the change.
And yes, I've changed my models, mainly in the face of experience. For example, I didn't take either the liquidity trap or the possibility of self-fulfilling currency crises seriously until 1998, when events in Asia led me to change my views. And I'm proud, not ashamed, of showing that kind of intellectual flexibility. What I don't believe I've done is change my models to support a predetermined political or policy position, which is a definite sin.
So you should try to think in terms of models; it will make you a better person.

HEADLINE: More Chips For Tax Reform

BYLINE: STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: As we scurry around looking for new revenue to help address the yawning budget deficit, let's zero in on the proper rate for capital gains and dividends. 

 BODY:
Almost lost in the tug of war over whether the top income tax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent is another consequential tax issue: the proper rate for capital gains and dividends.
It was the absurdly low rate on those forms of income - just 15 percent - that yielded Mitt Romney's embarrassingly small tax payments. And that's what also led to Warren E. Buffett's lament that his tax rate was lower than his secretary's.
So as we scurry around looking for new revenue to help address the yawning budget deficit, let's zero in on this special preference. 
President Obama has proposed much of the needed adjustment, including eliminating the special treatment of dividends and raising the tax on capital gains to 20 percent for the rich.
Personally, I would go further and raise the capital gains rate to 28 percent, right where it was during the strong recovery of Bill Clinton's first term, and grab hold of a total of $300 billion of new revenues over the next decade.
Inevitably, a chorus of outrage would greet any such increase. Capital investment would be severely impaired! Some of the wealthy might decamp from America! With a new 3.8 percent Medicare tax on unearned income about to take effect, this would exacerbate the disincentives for investment!
Put me down as skeptical about such dire forecasts. During my 30 years on Wall Street, taxes on "unearned income" have bounced up and down with regularity, and I've never detected any change in the appetite for hard work and accumulating wealth on the part of myself or any of my fellow capitalists.
Remember also that corporate leaders have pretty much convinced policy makers of both parties that business taxes should be reformed to allow them to compete more effectively around the globe. Providing this relief makes sense, but since the benefits would flow to shareholders, this is yet another argument for higher taxes on dividends.
Increased revenues, meaning higher taxes, will be a central element of any successful long-term budget plan, and President Obama is right to insist that the wealthy - the slice of America that has come through the recession in by far the best financial health - should provide those funds.
Here's the math: We need at least $4 trillion of long-term deficit reduction, with a substantial portion - on the order of $1.2 trillion - coming from new revenues.
That means other veins belonging to the wealthy will need to be tapped. Raising the tax rates for American households with incomes above $250,000 per year, as President Obama has proposed, would certainly be a productive and welcome step.
But viable alternative measures are available. At a minimum, we need to implement the "Buffett Rule," the concept that Americans making more than $1 million a year should pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. This wouldn't raise a huge amount of money - between $47 billion and $160 billion depending on what else is done to rates - but it would reinforce the responsibility of the wealthy to pay their fair share.
Another important step toward tax fairness would be to address the indefensibly low 15 percent tax rate on the famous "carried interest," the fee received by private equity and certain hedge fund investors.
As a beneficiary of the carried interest loophole, I've seen firsthand the lack of any difference between the work involved in generating a carried interest and the work done by millions of other professionals who are taxed at the full 35 percent rate.
Another productive area for raising revenue would be limiting deductions available to the wealthy. The highest-income Americans don't need tax-free health insurance, mortgage interest deductions or deferred taxation on retirement funds.
Mitt Romney himself proposed an efficient and effective approach: just limit the total amount of deductions. Even excluding charitable deductions from this limitation - as I would personally advocate - capping deductions at $25,000 would raise large amounts of revenue, an estimated $885 billion over the next 10 years.
While Mr. Romney called for applying the limitation to all Americans, a fairer approach would be to impose it only on the wealthiest.
These types of tax changes would have the ancillary benefit of defusing a specious argument that conservatives love to make: that raising the top rates on ordinary income would hurt small business.
Certainly no small business can claim to be damaged by a higher rate on dividends or capital gains or by the proprietor's losing some tax deductions.
So I'm all for raising rates as President Obama has proposed. But in a divided government, compromise is needed, and happily there are other chips that can be put on the table as we bargain over how to raise the needed revenue from the wealthy.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HORN, GARFIELD H.

 BODY:
HORN--Garfield H.,died November 9 at his home in Cold Spring Harbor, NY, at the age of 92. Born in Aberdeen, SD, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard University (1940), where he was editorial chairman of the Crimson, and Harvard Law School (1946) where he served as president of the Harvard Law Review. Mr. Horn joined the New York office of the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell in 1946, having interrupted his law school education to serve in the United States Navy during World War II. Mr. Horn left Sullivan & Cromwell in 1949 to become general counsel to the United States Special Representative in Europe of the Economic Cooperation Administration which administered the Marshall Plan. 
Following two years in that role in Paris, he returned to Sullivan & Cromwell and became a partner in 1953, where he practiced until his retirement in 1984. During his career in private practice, Mr. Horn was a preeminent international lawyer who handled private and public finance, corporate and other matters on six continents. In 1962 Mr. Horn re-opened his firm's Paris office, which had been closed since before the war, and served as the resident partner until 1965. In addition to his career in international law, Mr. Horn was a highly accomplished pianist, appearing at age 11 as a guest performer with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, as well as performing in public with his older brother Herbert. Husband of the late Alexandra Matz Horn, he is survived by his children, Jennifer, Charles and Leslie; daughters-in-law Elizabeth, wife of the late Garfield ("Pete") Henderson Horn, and Jane; sons-in-law Ronald and Simon, and grandchildren, Alexandra, Margaret, Andrew, Caroline, Robert, and Mia.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths RICH, ROBERT N

 BODY:
RICH--Robert N. Age 84, of Stamford, CT, passed away after a brief illness at his home in Shippan Point on November 17, 2012. A life-long resident of Stamford, Mr. Rich was graduated in 1944 from Stamford High School and in 1948 from Princeton University. His entire career, spanning nearly 65 years, was spent at F.D. Rich Company, a construction and real estate development firm founded by his father in 1921. The company became one of the largest construction firms in the nation; its projects spanned the continent from Alaska to the Caribbean with both private and public clients. The firm constructed major office buildings, shopping centers, research and office parks, industrial plants, airport terminals and hangars, flood control projects, pavilions at New York's 1964 World's Fair, schools and hospitals. The firm also constructed military and not-for-profit housing. In 1960 Mr. Rich's company was selected as the sole redeveloper of the downtown Stamford urban renewal project. 
The project was led by Mr. Rich in partnership with his late brother, Frank D. Rich, Jr., and the firm's chief counsel, the late Lawrence Gochberg. Construction commenced in 1968 on three architecturally-distinctive apartment buildings known as St. John's Towers. This was followed by the signature 21-story One Landmark Square, which for 35 years was the tallest building in the City and a symbol of its rebirth. Construction of the world headquarters of GTE Corporation, the Stamford Town Center mall, the Marriott Hotel and many other office and apartment projects soon followed. Between 1970 and 2000, Mr. Rich's leadership transformed Stamford from a fading industrial town suffering from severe urban blight to a thriving city which has emerged as an important center for commerce, culture, education and recreation. Mr. Rich employed world-class architects and designers such as Victor Bisharat, Moshe Safdie, Cesar Pelli, Mitchell/Giurgola, Hugh Stubbins and Arthur Erickson in order to create bold designs for the new Stamford skyline, well before the term "starchitects" was coined. Mr. Rich and his brother are credited with bringing a branch of the University of Connecticut to downtown Stamford, which features the Rich Concourse as its central public space. The family's involvement with the University began when his father's company constructed the Wilbur Cross Library at the Storrs campus in 1934. The relationship continued to grow when Frank D. Rich, Jr. served for over twenty years on the University's Board of Trustees. The Rich brothers were also credited with creating the Stamford Center for the Arts, which includes the Rich Forum and the Palace Theatre. Mr. Rich was a long-standing member of the Regional Plan Association and Stamford's State Street Debating Society, which in 2009 named him its Man of the Year. Mr. Rich was a member of the Stamford Yacht Club since 1951, which recently honored him with an award for his many contributions during his lengthy service on the Board of Directors when he was head of its Long-Range Planning Committee. Mr. Rich was a supporter, both personally and through the Rich Foundation, of many community organizations including the Boys and Girls Club (whose building is named in honor of his late mother) and the Stamford Hospital, which includes the Jeanne S. Rich Professional Office Building. Mr. Rich was a voracious reader, an inveterate traveler and a theater aficionado. He enjoyed spending as much time as possible at his second home in Tenterden, England. Asked recently what his proudest accomplishment was, Mr. Rich replied without hesitation and with his customary modesty, "That's simple. I am most proud of my wonderful family." He loved to plan reunions not only for the benefit of his family and many friends, but also for his school mates. A few years ago, one of these gatherings took place in Stamford in honor of his fellow classmates from Burdick Middle School. Born in Stamford on February 13, 1928, he was preceded in death by his wife, Jeanne Slavin Rich; his daughter, Amy Louise Rich; his parents, F.D. Rich, Sr. and Mary Prisco Rich; his brother, Frank D. Rich, Jr., and his sister-in-law, Jean Hopkins Rich. He is survived by his loving partner of more than thirty years, Valerie A. Wiltshire of Stamford; his daughters Priscilla A. Rich of Boone, NC, and Martha Rich Andrus (David) of Boulder, CO; and his sons Christopher M. Rich (Elizabeth) of Roanoke County, VA, and Thomas L. Rich (Suzanne Van Nostrand) of Stamford. Ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild also survive him. A memorial service in honor of Mr. Rich will be held at 11am on Friday, November 30, 2012, at the Stamford Yacht Club. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to the Boys and Girls Club of Stamford (online at: bgcastamford.org or by mail to the Mary C. Rich Clubhouse, 347 Stillwater Ave, Stamford, CT 06902).

HEADLINE: The Department Store's Magic, Dispelled by Online Shopping

BYLINE: By LEE SIEGEL. 
Lee Siegel is the author of, among other books, ''Are You Serious? How to Be True and Get Real in the Age of Silly.''

 BODY:
FOR all the feverish talk this last campaign season about taxes, immigration, taxes, Benghazi, taxes, Medicare, taxes, Iran, taxes, etc., there was one topic whose absence left me disappointed: department stores.
Yes, department stores. They are vital to the future of the middle class. They are essential to the preservation of American democracy.
Among civilized people, it is part of Christmas tradition to deplore the coarse commercialization of Christmas tradition. Stores putting up their holiday decorations earlier and earlier every year? The retail equivalent of the melting Arctic ice cap. Black Friday? An annual violation of human rights. But when the founding fathers penned those immortal words, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, they were thinking of Bloomingdale's. 
You might say that department stores run in my blood. I grew up in northern New Jersey, and Northern New Jerseyans do department-store retail the way 15th-century Florentines did painting and sculpture. As a boy, I was the Botticelli of Bamberger's.
That bygone house of treasures was where my friends and I first discovered the alchemy that lay in purchasable things. Racing up and down the magic-beanstalk escalators, we played hide-and-seek, taking refuge on the different floors. It was the height of the cold war. We were steeped in Bond movies and spy movies. Our parents might have been screaming at each other at home (it was also the time of countercultural temptation and crumbling marriages), but moving among the dark suits and somber raincoats of the Men's Department, as if on secret business in East Germany, you had a special destiny that made you invulnerable to mere domestic strife. Missoni Impossible.
Each floor was a world unto itself. In Women's Clothing, you could slip into an oversize Anne Klein coat and barely suppress your giggles as your pursuing friends walked right by you. From Women's, you sneaked up to the furniture floors, where you could reign over principalities of things that were off limits at home.
My parents had, it seemed, spent years talking about buying a fancy upholstered sofa the way the Allies had planned D-Day. Yet when the item arrived with the ceremony of a lifetime's crowning achievement (sic transit gloria), my mother immediately entombed it in a thick plastic sheet and made touching it a taboo on the order of incest.
Among the furniture for sale, however, I could loll on the sofas like the man of the house, sit behind mahogany desks with an air of my father's (waning) authority. I could be physically intimate with unattainable things. That was how eros first entered my life.
An atmosphere of eros surrounded the environment of items for sale. The realms of floors, of different departments, added to the feeling of arousal. Passing through Housewares, and Electronics, and Dining Room Furniture, and Bedding, and Sporting Goods and Toys, it was as if you were passing through the seasons and the cycles of life. And though so many of these experiences -- the men's suits, the grown-up furniture -- lay in the future, you knew that as time went on, they could be acquired. The fact that these things could be yours, and that therefore life seemed under your control, gave you a sense of power. And this giddiness of control through acquisition had something sexual about it.
It was almost inevitable that I had my first jobs in department stores, just as Native American children who grew up among horses and buffalo would one day become braves who rode and hunted. And it was just as inevitable that I had my first romantic and sexual experiences with the girls who worked there beside me.
Maybe the energy of purchasable goods that was transferred to the potential of winnable women was not the healthiest of associations. But what I learned was that, in order to successfully gain a woman's favor, you had to give her things. And to get the things, you had to work among the things. When I was a child, I played among Toys and Electronics. But when I grew up, I put away childish things and found work in Men's Furnishings. What can I say? Hemingway had the First World War. I had Gimbels.
I grew older, and the lessons turned into blessings. As an impoverished graduate student living on the Upper West Side, I discovered that precious gift to upward mobility: the Barneys warehouse sale. One day, I was surrounded by the pedigreed scions of wealth, my frayed sleeves and cheap shoes betraying my humble origins and straitened circumstances. The next I was an Armani-clad, Prada-shod prince.
There is nothing like the melting pot of the final feverish minutes of the warehouse sale, when prices are slashed by 80 percent and you can pick up a Calvin Klein sport jacket for the price of a bag of organic potatoes. Kids from the South Bronx are plowing bins of Brioni shirts alongside bankers and movie producers. Refugees who have fled from some of the most tragic places on earth are slipping their feet into Varvatos boots in preparation for a new life.
It is like those moments in Homer when a god casts a protective glow over a favored mortal. For a moment, the iron laws of economics surrender to the idea of equality. If the custodians of public order knew what depths of anarchy lurked in such moments of retail grace, they might not allow them.
But there is nostalgia clinging to department stores now, if not outright pathos, as online shopping approaches its final triumph. No more poor kids jostling with financial titans over Armani sweaters. No more stealing your first kiss in a stockroom among boxes of shoes like smitten actors smooching in the wings between acts. No more warehouse sales or Macy's one-day sales, in which capitalism lowers its fences and teeming humanity rushes in, like Walt Whitman's masses, in hopes of achieving through appearance what seems less and less attainable by merit alone.
So in this twilight of the department-store behemoths, bring on the holiday sanctums of retail. Say what you will about the many virtues of online convenience, without the tutelary symbolism of fitting rooms and escalators, the middle class will have one less inspiration on the road to fulfillment. Prada boots, start walking.

HEADLINE: More N.F.L. Teams Use Statisticians, but League Acceptance Is Not Mode

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
Jeff Dominitz grew up rooting for the Washington Redskins during their glory years under Joe Gibbs. So when an N.F.L. team called him in 2006 about a job doing statistical research and analysis for the scouting department, he could not say no. He left his teaching position at Carnegie Mellon and, temporarily, his family and wound up living alone near the team's headquarters.
The first sign that Dominitz's work might not be fully embraced came when he reported to the team's facility. According to Dominitz, who has a Ph.D. in economics, he was told that the head coach had been informed about Dominitz after he was already hired. The coach's response, Dominitz was told, was, ''We're still about people here.'' Dominitz then learned that he would be seated not with the scouting department, compiling detailed information about player prospects, but at a cubicle in a separate building, with the marketing department. Seven weeks later, Dominitz was gone. 
Dominitz later spent a few years working for another team, predicting how athletes would do in the N.F.L. based on their college and predraft performances, as well as analyzing overtime decision-making, among other tasks. Now the senior director at a Beverly Hills, Calif., economics consulting firm, he has given a lot of thought to why the rigorous study of advanced statistics is gaining a toehold among N.F.L. teams years after it swept through baseball and, more recently, the N.B.A.
''It can't just be money,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It's got to be some concern about the impact on the rest of the organization. You could see it in them putting me in the marketing building, trying to have as little impact on the rest of the organization as possible.
''To me, it's crazy not to try. It can only be a firm belief that it just can't work or the process of making it work will fail because you'll have so much resistance from the coaching staff.''
Perhaps. But when the Baltimore Ravens announced in August that they had hired a director of football analytics, it was a rare public signal of the growing interest among teams in weaving statistical analysis into game-day, draft and free-agency preparation, and even into the management of workouts and injury rehabilitation.
Several companies now study games to produce unique statistical analysis, including Football Outsiders, Advanced NFL Stats, Stats L.L.C. and ESPN. Few teams like to talk about the degree to which they use analytics because they fear giving away a competitive advantage. One general manager whose team does delve into statistics, but who didn't want to be identified, wondered why the Ravens announced the hire at all.
This general manager suspects that more teams do some form of statistical analysis than are publicly known. People who work in sports statistics, and coaches and general managers, agree that there has been a shift in the N.F.L.'s guarded thinking.
''The culture has changed exponentially in the last 12 months,'' said John Pollard, a general manager for Stats L.L.C. ''Last year was a jog. Now we're at a really good trot. This January, I think we'll be at a sprint with the mass adoption of tons of information services.''
The question remains how the shift changes a team and the game. Gil Brandt, a former personnel executive for the Dallas Cowboys, points to one way the league is already different. With advanced statistics, he notes, teams are able to see trends and adjust in real time. It used to be that teams would look back at how often they ran a play and how much it gained. Now, do they want to know Cam Newton's completion percentage when a defense rushes three? Or four? Or six or more? That information is available week to week, allowing teams to tailor game plans with far greater specificity.
Much of the work is also centered on figuring out some of the game's most vexing problems -- when to kick a field goal versus going for it on fourth down; what to do under the new overtime rules; when to challenge a call; when to use a timeout -- amid the chaos of the sideline.
The Jacksonville Jaguars, who this year created a football technology and analytics group, have pondered all those questions. The coaching staff had expressed interest in having information about how to function under the league's new overtime rules, which call for each team to get a possession unless the first team to get the ball scores a touchdown. But because the rule was so new, there were simply not enough comparable examples of game-time situations to produce a reliable model, said Tony Khan, the son of the Jaguars' new owner, Shad Khan, and the head of the analytics group.
''Baseball is an easier sport to prove out some of these concepts, because there are less variables,'' Tony Khan said. ''You can isolate the defense behind them; it's essentially a one-on-one matchup. And there are so many more plays in baseball that you can look at. If you want to look at every fourth down and five from that team's own 36-yard line, there aren't going to be all that many of those. And the 11-on-11 nature makes it harder to isolate credit for success and harder to isolate blame for mistakes. There is a reason why this caught on a lot sooner and developed a lot further in baseball than football.''
For most teams, though, the most intriguing application may come in player evaluation -- projecting how college players will perform in the N.F.L. and figuring out how valuable one player compared with another. The Jaguars, for instance, analyzed how often the receiver Justin Blackmon was targeted in obvious passing situations at Oklahoma State before they drafted him. Before they signed Laurent Robinson as a free agent, the Jaguars knew how many of Tony Romo's touchdown passes he caught on crossing routes with the Cowboys last season.
The Jaguars are also using data to monitor injuries and recovery, hoping to tailor players' practice regimens to keep them healthier longer, but also another potential boon when contracts are negotiated.
''Ideally, you want the objective and subjective to match up,'' said one general manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''The N.F.L. is about resource allocation -- you have a certain number of salary cap dollars and draft picks. If you found any area of the market that may be undervalued, you want to keep that information. At the end of the day, the tape is going to be our first choice. They have to look good on film.''
That seems to point to the central concern of coaches and statisticians alike: that there remains no perfect formula for assessing many of the game's positions, no football equivalent of OPS, the on-base plus slugging average now widely used as part of baseball player evaluation. While the quarterback can largely be isolated (ESPN created QBR as a way to try to improve quarterback evaluation by assessing his contribution to scoring points), it is much more difficult to assess each position on, for example, the offensive line, because the players' work is so tied together. And then there are the intangibles.
''How do you quantify, statistically, Ray Lewis?'' said Brian Billick, the former Ravens coach who calls himself a statistical nut. ''You can't. You still have to have a core of great players. I can wrap a lot of B players around those four core players. But you have to have those four.''
The debate over the role of statistic analysis is likely to grow as its use becomes more commonplace in one of the last holdout sports. But Brandt remembers the Cowboys' internal discussions about whether to draft Tony Dorsett or Ricky Bell in the 1977 draft. One of the Cowboys' scouts, Red Hickey, wanted Bell. Others wanted Dorsett.
The Cowboys had a book that listed previous players, their attributes and level of success. The most important determiner was quickness, the Cowboys believed. After a 30-minute debate, Coach Tom Landry asked Brandt to check the numbers.
''Dorsett was a cinch to be All-Pro, and Ricky Bell had a 60 percent chance of being an above-average starter,'' Brandt said. ''Do you know what Red Hickey said? 'I bow to the machine.' It's hard to teach an old dog new tricks. But this is a coming thing.''

HEADLINE: Casual Cuisine For Diverse Tastes

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER BROOKS

 BODY:
In an economy that sees restaurants opening and closing within months, the Woodland Restaurant in Lakeville is one of those rarities that have been around for decades -- since 1983, in fact. There is no secret behind its longevity, simply an adherence to the old dictum about giving the customer what he or she wants.
That means roll-up-your-sleeves casual, as in no tablecloths, lots of potted plants and a communal table as well as booths and banquettes. The food is also casual, hewing to no fixed geography or style. If you can't find something to please your palate on Woodland's three-page menu, you must not be trying. 
One reason for Woodland's continuing success may be that the chef, Robert Peters, constantly refreshes Woodland with a full page of daily specials.
Many of those are so popular that they reappear night after night. That was the case with truffled Parmesan frites, paired with a garlicky aioli, as well as a roasted beet salad. The fries were decadently irresistible in their thin crispiness and sprinkling of truffle oil, and an appetizer portion was large enough for a table of four to share. The plate of sliced beets, laced with toasted almonds and circlets of pickled onion, was also served in a very generous portion. The sour-saltiness of ricotta salata beautifully complemented the beets' sweet-smoky-earthy notes.
Of the two soups we tried, we preferred the Tuscan white bean, with a tomato base, diced carrots, celery and a pinch of pepper and thyme, to an overly starchy New England clam chowder. In an appetizer of steamed mussels, the buttery white-wine broth was delicious, but the mussels -- about 30 of them -- were disappointingly small and had been simmered too long.
Overcooking was certainly not an issue with the charred filet of beef. Despite a darkened crust, the filet mignon, strip-sliced, displayed a perfectly rare interior, and a ginger dipping sauce provided a nice accent to the succulent meat. The same sort of sauce, with overtones of sesame oil, accompanied vegetable tempura, which, like the charred beef, is listed among the appetizers. Ideally, tempura batter should be as light as a feather, crisp as a potato chip and pale as a ghost. If Woodland's effort failed to achieve the Japanese ideal, it at least provided good value in its array of vegetables.
Hearty sides accompany most of the entrees, including, most recently, buttery string beans, silky-smooth butternut squash and mashed potatoes or -- in the case of red snapper in Thai curry sauce -- rice. The fish, poached and saturated with a delectably peppery sauce dense with creamy coconut milk, was presented on a banana leaf and came with spicy black beans and fresh, lime-struck papaya salsa.
Also prepared with aplomb -- and plenty of butter -- was sautéed shrimp with garlic and roasted peppers. The half-dozen jumbo shrimp were done to a perfect degree of moistness, and well swathed in garlic, shredded pimentos and perhaps a hint of white wine. Adding to their allure was a subtle undertone of citrus, from a lemon-juice marinade.
At $29, lamb shank is one of Woodland's most expensive entrees. Yet here, too, the kitchen showed its largess. The shank -- almost as big as a leg -- had been slow-cooked for hours, and the meat was falling off the marrow-filled bone. An au jus reduction, based in part on veal stock, reflected notes of red wine, celery, carrots, onion and butter.
Beyond the tempura, Woodland offers numerous Japanese specialties. In the sushi and sashimi combination platter, which included a well-made California roll, I found all of the seafood (yellowtail, tuna, salmon and shrimp) competently prepared and of high quality. Among other sushi options are numerous hand rolls and such favorites as flying fish roe and broiled eel.
As with the main menu, Woodland's desserts cover the map. Among the lighter dishes are a vanilla-accented rum-raisin rice pudding, the raisins plump with Myers's, and key lime pie, on a thin layer of graham-cracker crumbs, its custardy body sharp with lime juice. An apple crisp was top-heavy with toasted walnuts and curiously light on apples. And bananas Foster consisted of large scoops of ice cream and whipped cream, and four banana halves crusted with caramelized brown sugar. It was flambéed in the kitchen rather than tableside, and just as well -- in such a crowded restaurant, it would be foolish to play with fire.

HEADLINE: Our Enemy, the Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.

 BODY:
WE have two political parties in America, runs a saying that conservatives like to quote. One is stupid, the other is evil. And when they join forces to do something that's both stupid and evil -- well, that's what we call ''bipartisanship.''
The payroll tax holiday that passed Congress in the winter of 2010 was a rare exception to this pessimistic rule. Cutting the payroll tax was good short-term politics for both Democrats and Republicans: it was a tax cut that liberals hoped would double as stimulus, and a boost to the middle class that conservatives could support without embracing new federal spending. But more important, it opened the door to what would be good long-term policy as well -- because more than almost any feature of the American tax code, the payroll tax deserves to be pared away into extinction. 
But now Washington is in danger of practicing payroll-tax bipartisanship of a more destructive sort. While the White House and Congressional Republicans wrestle over where to set income tax rates and how and whether to cut spending, the payroll tax holiday has been orphaned. Lacking noisy champions and press attention, it's in danger of expiring at the end of the year out of political indifference.
That outcome would be unfortunate. Payroll taxes are a relic of New Deal Machiavellianism: by taking a bite of every worker's paycheck and promising postretirement returns, Franklin Roosevelt effectively disguised Social Security as a pay-as-you-go system, even though the program actually redistributes from rich to poor and young to old. That disguise has helped keep Social Security sacrosanct -- hailed by Democrats because it protects the poor and backed by Republicans as a reward for steady work.
But the costs of this disguise have grown too great to bear. Whatever its past political advantages, the payroll tax now imposes an unnecessary burden on a stagnating economy. In an era of mass unemployment, mediocre wage growth and weak mobility from the bottom of the income ladder, it makes no sense to finance our retirement system with a tax that falls directly on wages and hiring and imposes particular burdens on small business and the working class.
What's more, the payroll tax as it exists today can't cover the program's projected liabilities anyway, and the pay-as-you-go myth stands in the way of the changes required to keep Social Security solvent. All of the components of a sensible Social Security reform -- means-testing for wealthier beneficiaries, changing the way benefits adjust for inflation, a slow increase in the retirement age -- become easier if the program is treated as normal safety-net spending rather than an untouchable entitlement with a dedicated funding stream.
By cutting the tax rate and promising to make up the difference out of general revenue, the payroll tax holiday took a big step in this direction -- and letting it expire would take a big step back. Republicans have every reason to recognize this reality: their long-term size-of-government goals require Social Security reform, and the illusions fostered by the payroll tax are an obstacle -- originally created by their political enemies! -- to any restraint in what the program spends.
Instead, a mix of ideology and cynicism has tilted Republicans against the payroll tax cut. The party's ideologues regard the issue as a distraction from the more important debate over income taxes, and some of them fret, à la Mitt Romney with the ''47 percent,'' about taking too many Americans off the tax rolls. The party's cynics, meanwhile, have seized on the opportunity to imitate liberal scare campaigns on Social Security, and posture as staunch defenders of the retirement status quo.
It's been left to a few prominent Democrats, including Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, to make the case for letting the holiday continue. This is a positive sign for liberalism, since it suggests a preference for middle-class paychecks over middle-class entitlements, and a willingness to recognize that the ideals of work and thrift and upward mobility aren't necessarily well served by the way we tax and spend today.
It will be a discouraging sign for conservatism if these Democrats don't find Republican allies. Nothing cost the Republican Party more dearly in the last election than the sense that the party didn't care about the struggles of the middle class. The payroll tax cut is addressed directly to those struggles -- and it's also a case where the short-term interests of Americans living paycheck to paycheck align with the long-term conservative interest in entitlement reform.
That combination doesn't often come around. So there is only one question conservatives should be asking about the payroll tax holiday: How do we make it permanent?

HEADLINE: Mario's Army Fights Back

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
REDMOND, Wash.
TUCKED in the woods here, west of State Route 520, is a little piece of the Mario Kingdom.
Behind the unassuming doors is the business built by Mario, the pudgy plumber, and Luigi, his lanky brother, as well as characters like Link, wielder of the mystical Master Sword, and Princess Zelda, of the royal family of Hyrule. All of them, and more, are the pixelated children of Shigeru Miyamoto, the Walt Disney of video games and creative genius of the Nintendo Company of Japan.
But while Mr. Miyamoto is dreaming his dreams across the Pacific, an army of marketing types is at work here in Redmond, inside the shiny new headquarters of Nintendo of America. This palace of play is quiet, but there's trouble brewing in the world around it: three decades after the mustachioed Mario burst into arcades via Donkey Kong, plucking countless quarters from people's pockets, the kingdom is under siege. 
Nintendo's enemies have arrived by battalions. Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja and other inexpensive, downloadable games, particularly for cellphones and tablets, have invaded its turf. Changing tastes and technology have called into question the economics of traditional game consoles, whether from Nintendo or Microsoft, maker of the Xbox. Nintendo recently posted the first loss in its era as a video games company, a prospect that would have been unimaginable only a few years ago. And while game consoles aren't going away, analysts are skeptical that the business will regain its former stature soon.
All of which makes Nintendo's next move, and what is happening here, so crucial. Nintendo counterattacked on Nov. 18, when a new version of its Wii game console arrived in stores nationwide.
The original Wii, the first wireless, motion-capturing console, was nothing less than revolutionary. The simplicity of its controller, which Mr. Miyamoto helped design, attracted new audiences like women and older people. Customers lined up in stores for it -- and then it simply faded. Now, the new console, the Wii U, may be Nintendo's last, best hope for regaining its former glory. Executives are hoping for a holiday hit, and perhaps even another runaway success.
Initial demand appears high. GameStop, the video game retailer, opened 3,000 stores at midnight on Thursday for Black Friday sales, and before long almost all its Wii Us were sold out, according to Tony Bartel, GameStop's president. ''I think people are starving for innovation, and Wii U is giving them that innovation," Mr. Bartel says.
THE Wii U is a recognition that the living room is no longer the province of a single screen. More people, particularly the young, now watch TV with a smartphone or tablet in hand, the better to tweet a touchdown or update their Facebook status during a commercial. The Wii U looks like a mash-up of an iPad and a traditional console, with a touch screen embedded in the middle. It's no mere festival of joysticks, buttons and triggers.
But will it be the blowout that Nintendo needs? Many industry veterans and game reviewers are skeptical. They question whether the Wii U can be as successful as the original, now that many gamers have moved on to more abundant, cheaper and more convenient mobile games.
''I actually am baffled by it,'' Nolan K. Bushnell, the founder of Atari and the godfather of the games business, says of the Wii U. ''I don't think it's going to be a big success.''
The bigger question is what the future holds for any of the major game systems, including new ones that Sony and Microsoft are expected to release next year. Echoing other industry veterans, Mr. Bushnell says that consoles are already delivering remarkable graphics and that few but the most hard-core players will be willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a new game box.
''These things will continue to sputter along, but I really don't think they'll be of major import ever again,'' he says. ''It feels like the end of an era to me.''
Nintendo is unbowed. Mr. Miyamoto was involved in developing the original Wii, and had a role in the Wii U as well. He rarely gives interviews, and was unavailable for comment for this article.
But one recent evening in Redmond, Corey Olcsvary, a Nintendo product marketing specialist, was slashing his fingers across the touch screen on the GamePad, as the Wii U controller is called, casting ''throwing stars'' at a ninja gang that sprang from the corners of a giant TV screen. In another game, a group of players chased Mario -- one of the most popular video game characters ever -- around a maze shown on a TV while Mr. Olcsvary stared at a bird's-eye view of the maze on his GamePad and tried to help Mario dodge his pursuers. The players shouted when they caught sight of Mario's red overalls and cheered when they tackled him.
Starting in December, people will also be able to use the GamePad as a remote control to set recordings and change channels on their cable and satellite TV services.
Reggie Fils-Aime, president and chief operating officer of Nintendo's United States unit, acknowledges that mobile games have changed the market. But he says wide recognition of the Nintendo and Wii brands, and of Mario, Zelda and other favorites available exclusively on Nintendo systems, will offer a strong tail wind for the Wii U.
''It comes down to providing consumers new, unique experiences they can't get anywhere else, experiences that really make them say, 'Wow, this is fantastic,' '' Mr. Fils-Aime says.
NINTENDO has been in the business of fun since 1889. Its founder, Fusajiro Yamauchi, made playing cards. His great-grandson Hiroshi Yamauchi landed a licensing agreement with the Walt Disney Company and turned out Mickey Mouse playing cards. By the 1960s, Nintendo was pushing into other toys and games. Then, in 1975, Atari introduced a home version of Pong, the first hit video arcade game. Soon, Nintendo was chasing video games as the hot new thing, too.
But the history of games hardware is littered with spectacular flameouts, including Sega, 3DO and Mr. Bushnell's own Atari. Nintendo has endured through a combination of ingenuity and obsessive focus on both hardware and software, a path that makes it something like the Apple of video games.
Its gutsiest bet on the hardware side was the Wii, which came out at a time when it looked as if Nintendo was drifting to the margins. Nintendo couldn't afford to join in the arms race, led by its much bigger rivals Sony and Microsoft, to create systems with the most graphics horsepower. (Years after its rivals, Nintendo has finally embraced high-definition graphics with the Wii U.)
The Wii strategy led to a big comeback. Nintendo has shipped close to 100 million Wiis, while Sony and Microsoft have each shipped about 70 million of their latest consoles.
Through it all, Mr. Miyamoto, now 60, was the creative force. But in the last year, he has let some lieutenants take on more responsibility, the better to prepare Nintendo for his eventual retirement. Mr. Fils-Aime, who would not predict when that day would be, says Mr. Miyamoto's engagement at the company ''continues to be at the highest level.''
Just as Apple has insisted on making both hardware and software, rather than licensing the Mac and iPhone operating systems to others, Nintendo does not create games for devices made by other companies, including the hundreds of millions of iPod Touches, smartphones and tablets out there. Industry executives say this represents a missed opportunity, allowing a new generation of game brands, like Angry Birds, to emerge unchallenged on mobile devices, much as Disney did in another realm years ago by allowing Pixar to own computer animation. (Disney later bought Pixar.)
''It's the hardest strategic decision Nintendo has had to face in a long time,'' says Robbie Bach, the former head of Microsoft's Xbox business. ''Would Mario on an iPhone be an interesting property? I think yes, it would.''
Mr. Fils-Aime says that won't happen, arguing that Nintendo's approach is the best way for it to create unique games. ''That's the business decision we've made,'' he says, though he adds that the company may allow people to buy its games through mobile phones and have them delivered to their Nintendo devices.
While it's not unusual for sales of a particular game console to sag over time, the decline for Nintendo products in recent years has been especially brutal. The company lost 43.2 billion yen, or about $530 million, in the fiscal year ended March 31, after sharply reducing the price of a new portable game console, the Nintendo 3DS, in an effort to bolster sales. (Results were also hurt by a strong yen.) Its revenue was about a third of what it was three years earlier, when sales of the Wii and a portable device, the Nintendo DS, were booming.
''That was a magical moment,'' says John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment, referring to Nintendo's high point a few years ago. ''The market has now moved on from that. I don't think people view an integrated tablet within the Nintendo ecosystem as nearly as impactful.''
Another worrisome trend for Nintendo is that the old way of pricing and selling games seems broken. In a rocky economy, it's harder to persuade people to spend $50 to $60 -- what titles typically cost for Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft systems -- to buy a game. The Wii U itself starts at $300, versus $250 for the original Wii.
Cellphones and tablets have given people a nearly bottomless supply of games that typically cost a few dollars at most. Web and Facebook games are usually free, with the option to buy, say, a faster car or another virtual item that enhances the game. Industry veterans argue that you get what you pay for: mobile and Facebook games that are shallow entertainment experiences, compared with those of console games.
Mobile games are also instantly accessible online -- and while it takes seconds to start a game on a smartphone or tablet, it can take minutes to get a console up and running after turning on all of the relevant equipment.
MOBILE games have hurt sales of dedicated portable game devices from Nintendo and Sony, but analysts and game executives say they don't think the threat stops there.
Mitch Lasky, a veteran industry executive and now a venture capitalist at Benchmark Capital, says he has walked into his living room, which is brimming with all the major game consoles, a library of new titles and a 60-inch plasma TV, only to find his children crowded around an iPhone playing Temple Run, an app-powered game available free.
''They were very much more interested in the immediacy of the mobile experience,'' says Mr. Lasky, who has funded several online games companies. ''I'm looking at the $60 game the way I am a big-budget Hollywood movie. Yeah, I'm buying three or four a year -- Call of Duty, Uncharted -- but for the equivalent of television, I'm going to mobile platforms and free-to-play.''
Mr. Fils-Aime says game developers can offer free games for the Wii U that generate revenue through the sale of virtual items. Sony, too, is allowing that approach with games for the PlayStation 3, and it is expected that Microsoft will more seriously embrace it as well.
It's likely that Nintendo will eventually face a more direct challenge in the living room from the same technology companies that have reshaped the mobile games business. Amazon, Apple and Google are all strong contenders to be in that camp, given their innovation track records. None have yet developed direct console competitors that have serious game-playing capabilities.
Still, Nintendo has overcome the odds before. Mr. Bach, the Microsoft ex-executive, says he doesn't underestimate the company. ''I've learned not to count the Nintendo guys out,'' he says.

HEADLINE: States Want To Have Say During Talks Over Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Their states are still recovering from the recession, and now the nation's governors are bracing, again, for cuts in federal aid.
They have been down this road before -- Congress has already missed several self-imposed deadlines to cut the deficit -- but many say they fear that this time, the talks in Washington to avert the so-called fiscal cliff will actually lead to deep cuts.
So they want a say in the negotiations.
''The main message is that it's important to remember that, on a lot of areas of governance, we're partners -- and that these issues can't be solved simply by cost-shifting to the states, because the states aren't really in a position to do all that,'' said Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, chairman of the National Governors Association. ''We just want to make sure that we have a voice as these decisions are being made.'' 
But there is a long history of the federal government's giving short shrift to the needs of states and cities -- by making cuts in federal aid that forced service cuts or tax increases at the local level, or by passing laws requiring localities to take expensive actions without giving them the money to do so.
So in recent days, more than a dozen mayors with the United States Conference of Mayors have gone to Washington to lobby lawmakers. And last Monday, Mr. Markell, a Democrat, joined several governors from both parties to discuss the issue on a conference call with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The states, whose tax collections are still below the peak levels they reached in 2008, are in something of an unusual situation. That is because the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that are scheduled to begin in January, called ''the fiscal cliff'' by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, are actually better for them in some respects than many of the alternate proposals in Washington.
Half of the cuts scheduled to take effect at the beginning of next year would be to military spending, which would affect states only indirectly. The scheduled cuts to domestic programs would leave Medicaid, the single biggest source of federal aid to states, untouched. And the planned federal tax increases would increase revenues in states whose tax codes are closely linked to the federal code.
But governors said that no one was rooting for President Obama and Republicans in Congress to fail to reach a financial accord, in part because they fear that the resulting combination of spending cuts and tax increases could prompt another recession, which their states can ill afford.
Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, a Republican, noted that the spending cuts and tax increases were intended to be so undesirable that they would spur opposing sides in Washington to overcome their antagonism and strike a deal on taxes and spending just to avoid them.
The plan ''was designed to be a terrible answer,'' Mr. Snyder said, ''and I think they did a fairly effective job of doing that.''
Pat McCrory, the Republican governor-elect of North Carolina and former mayor of Charlotte, said state and local officials needed a greater voice in Washington.
''I don't think the debate should be just between the White House and Capitol Hill, but the state and local government should be at the table,'' Mr. McCrory said. ''Because I assume some of their answers are going to be pass-throughs to the states or to cities, as I saw as mayor in the past.''
The automatic cuts would hurt states in several areas. A recent analysis by the Pew Center on the States found that roughly 18 percent of the federal grant dollars flowing to the states would be subject to across-the-board cuts, including money for education, public housing and nutrition programs for low-income women and children.
But some governors fear that any ''grand bargain'' struck by Mr. Obama and Congress could lead to even deeper cuts to states, and they worry that it could include tax provisions that they believe would be harmful, like ending the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds that makes the bonds more attractive to investors.
But the needs of states and cities have often been an afterthought when Washington has talked about curbing spending.
Alice M. Rivlin, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget who served on two recent high-profile federal commissions -- the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, better known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission, and the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force -- acknowledged as much in an appearance this summer.
''I've served on not one but two commissions on the federal deficit,'' Ms. Rivlin said when another group she belongs to, the State Budget Crisis Task Force, released a report warning of the fiscal problems facing states. ''And I can attest that although we were certainly aware that the proposals we made would impact state and local government, we did not do a serious analysis of what would happen.''
Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, has been on both sides of the federal-state divide: trying to cut the federal budget as a chairman of the House Budget Committee, and now seeking to preserve services, especially for the poor, as a governor.
''I'm just saying that if you're going to affect us, you'd better realize there's a bottom line that affects flesh and blood and real people,'' he said this month at a meeting of the Republican Governors Association. ''And you can easily throw every one of these budgets into the red by just trying to get a nice number.''
The absence of a formal dialogue between the federal government and the states was cited as a danger by the State Budget Crisis Task Force, a private group led by Richard Ravitch, a former lieutenant governor of New York, and Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
''There are no standing structures and procedures within the federal government for analyzing the impacts on states and localities of reduced federal spending or federal tax changes, and there is little dialogue about these issues between the federal government and state and local governments,'' its report said last summer. It recommended creating something like the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, which lasted from 1959 to 1996.
John Kincaid, a former executive director of the advisory commission, which included federal and state officials, said it grew less effective as political polarization increased.
''No matter what happens in Washington, it's going to hit state and local governments very hard,'' said Mr. Kincaid, who is now a professor of government and public service at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. ''I think, by and large, states have become accustomed to this pattern of decision-making, so they're going to brace themselves for whatever comes. State and local officials will lobby very hard to get what they can out of this bargain, but they won't be all that significant as players.''

HEADLINE: Hayden Howland, Ross Vellacott

 BODY:
Hayden Firestone Howland and Ross Francis Vellacott were married Saturday evening at East Congregational Church in Grand Rapids, Mich. The Rev. Bethany Watkins Lowery, a Disciples of Christ minister, performed the ceremony. 
The couple, both 27, met in 2004 during Ms. Howland's junior year abroad at the University of Western Australia in Perth, from which the groom graduated and the bride received a graduate diploma in the arts.
The bride is keeping her name. She is a manager in the fund-raising department of the Cleveland Orchestra, and is on the board of Summer on the Cuyahoga, which places students from seven colleges in summer internships in Cleveland. She graduated from Smith.
She is a daughter of Amna P. Seibold and Paul Howland of East Grand Rapids, Mich., where her mother is the mayor and the director of the department of pathology at St. Mary's Health Care, a hospital in Grand Rapids.

HEADLINE: Dancing Up a Storm but Dying to Rock

BYLINE: By SIMON REYNOLDS

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
AT the Third Encore rehearsal studio in North Hollywood there's a wall decorated with photographs of clients who've prepared there for tours, legends like Robert Plant and Slash. In a room behind that wall, waiting while her band and dancers rehearse for a live appearance at the American Music Awards, sat Kesha, 25, a young woman who'd really like to join that swaggering pantheon. A hugely popular, if deeply polarizing, singer who ruled the radio in 2010 with No. 1 smashes like ''Tik Tok'' and now returns with ''Warrior'' (RCA), the follow-up to the smash album ''Animal'' and its EP supplement, ''Cannibal,'' Kesha would be filed under dance pop by most people. So it's surprising to discover just how much reverence she has for the rock 1970s, an era that ended seven years before she was born. 
For instance Kesha's look today was inspired by Marc Bolan of the glam-rock band T. Rex. ''I was watching a documentary on Bolan, and he's wearing all these funny suits, and I was like, 'I want to wear a funny suit,' '' she said. She was sporting a black wide-brimmed hat with a pink rose nestled in it, a black jacket with a garish floral pattern and a pimplike extravagance of rings. Strangely, though, there's no glitter, one of Kesha's trademarks and an affinity she shares with that long-dead rocker. And like Bolan, Kesha practices her own androgyny. The persona she developed on ''Animal'' parties hard, trash-talks and treats conquests like sex toys, just as male rock stars have done for decades. But precisely because Kesha challenged double standards by seizing male rock's license to misbehave, she became a lightning rod for contempt.
''Oh God, I have so many people who hate me, it's unbelievable,'' Kesha said, her laughter tinged with discomfort. ''It's the main reason I don't go online.'' She added, ''There's people who want me to die.'' The Web abuse includes hate blogs and a patronizing video skit made by a Princeton humor magazine in which the poet Paul Muldoon analyzes ''Tik Tok.''
Attributing her use of rapping and AutoTune to an inability to sing, detractors assumed that Kesha was a manufactured puppet. Actually she jointly writes her songs, supplying the lyrics and most of the vocal melodies. The rap element, influenced by the Beastie Boys, and the gimmicky use of AutoTune effects, inspired by Daft Punk, were deliberate choices. As with other female stars with over-the-top cartoon images, like Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj, the persona is her own creation. ''Kesha'' is an amped-up caricature of Kesha Sebert's real self and the feral lifestyle she was leading here at the time ''Animal'' was recorded. And whether you find her trashy antics annoying or refreshing in a pop era of anodyne glamour, there's no denying that Kesha's music caught the mood of embattled hedonism in post-crash America. Her live-for-now stance, in songs like the current hit single ''Die Young,'' made her pop's YOLO queen two years before that acronym, which stands for ''You only live once,'' became a rallying cry for let's-get-wrecked recklessness.
Discussing her potty-mouthed, Jack Daniels-swigging image, she said: ''You must realize by this point that I'm in on the joke. I know I sound like a jackass half the time. I do it on purpose.'' Actually Kesha seemed not very jackasslike that evening, but reflective and earnest. Flashes of the flirty playfulness of her videos were offset by hints of vulnerability.
Robin James, a professsor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who writes about female personas in 21st century pop culture, argued that messy hedonism is treated differently when the perpetrator is female. ''If you look at, say, Judd Apatow movies, the women have to be responsible and stable and pursue careers, while the men get to behave badly,'' she said. ''But when women are irresponsible, they get punished for it.''
The title ''Warrior'' crystallizes Kesha's defiance. ''It's about being fearless, about fighting for who you are and not letting anybody else break your spirit,'' she said. ''And that's for me, and that's for my fans. I'm massively supportive of gay and lesbian equal rights, and so many of my really young fans go through bullying at school and online and through social media.''
But the title is also an extension of the long-running ''Fight for your right to party'' theme in her music. Songs like ''Crazy Kids'' and ''All That Matters'' express a lust for life tinged with apocalyptic desperation. Her favorite lyrical maneuvers involve images of time running out and exhortations to live as if it's the last night of your life, a sentiment that underpins the new album's ''Die Young'' and ''Out Alive'' and also served as the premise of ''Till the World Ends,'' the Britney Spears hit that Kesha partly wrote.
''I don't want to waste my life worrying about the past or worrying about the future, I'd rather live in the present,'' Kesha said, a gold tooth glinting. ''It's like Talking Heads' 'Once in a Lifetime.' I love that song, and I've always wanted to make sure I don't wake up one day and realize I've been sleepwalking through life. I try to face every single day like it's a crazy, weird adventure.''
The flurry of hit singles from ''Animal'' and ''Cannibal'' paved the way for numerous YOLO-theme songs in 2011 and this year, performed by artists like Usher and Big Sean. Kesha was among the first pop artists to tap into inchoate feelings bubbling up from within popular culture: a sense of ''no future'' related to the financial crash and economic precariousness. According to Ms. James, who is working on a book that examines the relationships between pop culture, capitalism and the perception of time, ''planning for the future and long-term goals don't make sense'' for people whose lives are organized around flexible work patterns and jobs that lack a career structure. ''So why defer gratification?'' she said. ''Opportunities for fun might not be there tomorrow.''
At the same time a live-for-now, thrill-seeking attitude is embedded in rock history. On her best songs, like ''Animal'' and ''We R Who We R,'' Kesha comes across like a mall-rat Jim Morrison (who counseled Doors fans not to ''waste the dawn''). This year advance news reports about ''Warrior'' promised a full-blown dive into raunchy rock, inspired by the strut of '70s bands like Led Zeppelin and AC/DC. There were suggestions of wildness to come, like a psychedelic noisescape Kesha made with Wayne Coyne of Flaming Lips that circulated online.
But at some point during the making of ''Warrior'' the Kesha-as-rocker plan got scaled back. ''I went in there really wanting to destroy with guitars,'' she recalled. But then she and her principal producer, Dr. Luke, had a sit-down. ''Luke said, 'If you want to be on pop radio, really what's dominating right now is dance -- superdance.' And I was like, 'I don't want to go full-on rock, I just want to marry the kind of music I listen to and the kind of music I make.' ''
Dr. Luke remembers the album's evolution slightly differently. ''I don't know that there was a specific conversation, but Kesha is very interested in what's going on the radio. She wants to write uncompromising music that she loves and that's fun for her to do, but at the same time she also wants to have huge hits.'' However it came about, the shift in direction was a smart move. The strongest tunes, like ''Supernatural,'' develop the electropop sound of ''Animal'' into a digital-rock style that melds the attack of punk with the sound palette of electronic dance music and dubstep.
Kesha's other goal was to eliminate AutoTune, the pitch-correction technology whose glisten of nonhuman perfection is glazed across 21st-century radio. That would have been a reversal of ''Animal,'' where Kesha and Dr. Luke found ways to use AutoTune to make the singer sound more full of character, not less: amplifying her bratty insolence to the edge of irritation, distorting choruses and even warping individual words. ''Kesha has an incredible natural voice,'' Dr. Luke said. ''The first thing I ever heard from her was a demo when she was 17 and living in Nashville, just her voice and an acoustic guitar. But when we made 'Animal,' she was listening to things like Daft Punk and really wanted to try all those vocal-processing techniques. On 'Warrior' AutoTune is still there in places, but we use it a lot less.''
These split impulses -- the atavistic desire to rock out versus the hunger to reconquer contemporary pop radio -- mean that ''Warrior'' is more varied than ''Animal'' but less cohesive. Screeching guitar appears here and there, as do alternative-rock collaborators like Ben Folds and Patrick Carney of the Black Keys. These appearances feel like residues of Kesha's original plan to recreate, as she put it, the free-form ''spirit of the '70s'' amid the mouse-clicking approach to production in ''this age of using computers.''
There are two all-out rockers: the Lynyrd Skynyrd meets Joan Jett of ''Gold Trans Am,'' and ''Dirty Love,'' a duet with Iggy Pop, who ranks alongside Bolan as Kesha's biggest inspiration. ''I'm obsessed with him, I'm such a stalker,'' she said, explaining that her older brother turned her on to Iggy Pop's band the Stooges when she was 10. ''Iggy is one of the reasons I do music.'' Pictures of the two in the studio appear in her photo-memoir ''My Crazy Beautiful Life,'' just published by Touchstone: Iggy Pop, 65, shirtless and showing off his buff, leathery torso, and Kesha, arm around his shoulder, mock-snarling.
One of Iggy Pop's solo albums is titled ''Soldier.'' Kesha describes herself as ''a fighter since I was a little.'' She added: ''It was always: No, you can never do that. No, that's too lofty a dream. No, you're not pretty enough. No, you're not skinny enough.'' Her mother, a singer-songwriter who raised Kesha and her brothers in Van Nuys, Calif., and in Nashville amid hardscrabble, bohemian circumstances, ''always told me that anybody who says 'You can't do that,' give them the finger. And then go do it anyways.' ''
That's the place her songs, with their blend of exuberant carelessness, self-esteem building and party-hard triumphalism, come from. The only hitch is that success has interfered with Kesha's ability to live impulsively. She's so disciplined about her career that she now has to schedule her wildness. ''My drunk time has diminished,'' she said, smiling but with a hint of ruefulness. ''I'm known as a party girl, but I think it would be tragically boring to actually live that stereotype. I don't waste time, and I'm not going to waste my life. As hard as I party, I work a thousand times harder.''

HEADLINE: The Choreography of Goodbye

BYLINE: By BRIAN SEIBERT

 BODY:
ON Dec. 9 at City Center, Renee Robinson will do something she has done more times -- in front of more people, in more cities of the world -- than she can easily calculate. This time, though, will be the last: the last time as a member of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater that she holds the white parasol above the baptism scene in ''Revelations,'' the last time she and her yellow dress help turn the whole theater into a rocking church. Ms. Robinson is retiring.
Her tenure, which began in 1981, is the longest of any female dancer in Ailey company history. She is the last dancer still performing with the troupe to have been chosen by the founder, Alvin Ailey (who died in 1989). She is the only Ailey dancer to have performed under all three of the company's artistic directors: Ailey, Judith Jamison and, starting last year, Robert Battle. 
But none of these facts explains entirely why Ms. Robinson will be missed. In the Ailey building recently Matthew Rushing -- the company's rehearsal director, who has shared stages with Ms. Robinson for 20 years -- recalled the first time he saw her perform: ''She transcended technique. It was more than just stage presence. And it wasn't just talent. It opened my eyes to another realm, how she could command a stage but also make people feel comfortable to let their guards down.''
''From then on,'' Mr. Rushing continued, ''I looked for that thing. And Renee always delivered. She did it in rehearsal. And over the years she got better and better. That was another lesson: that it doesn't have to go downhill after a certain point.''
Ms. Robinson does not disclose her age, and in a conversation at the Ailey studios she would speak only reluctantly about her decision to stop dancing with the company. ''Oh man,'' she said, ''it was super hard.''
But she recently returned to school, earning a master's degree in dance from Hollins University in Virginia. Going back to school also closed a loop that Ms. Robinson's three decades with Ailey had interrupted.
Her early training was in classical ballet. She began at the Jones-Haywood School, a Washington institution founded to offer ballet instruction to African-Americans who were not always welcome elsewhere. Her dancing won her a scholarship to New York University, where she majored in dance but minored in economics, thinking she would become a lawyer.
''Back then,'' Ms. Robinson recalled, ''the thought was, if you went to college, by the time you graduated you would be too old to start a dance career.''
After her first year in New York though, friends persuaded her to audition for a scholarship at the Ailey school. Despite her minimal background in modern dance she was accepted. She dropped out of N.Y.U., joined an Ailey workshop troupe, and, after twice auditioning unsuccessfully, entered the main company.
Asked which Ailey dancers she emulated, Ms. Robinson said, ''All of them.'' Asked which Ailey role was her favorite, she answered the same. What she remembers about working with the choreographer Ulysses Dove is that he didn't mind that she fell. (''I fell a lot my first year,'' she remembers.) What she appreciates about rehearsing Judith Jamison works is that she ''wants you to come into the studio already sparkling, and I have a tendency to be a little clunky at first, and those ballets pushed me right out of the starting gate.''
Over the years Ms. Robinson has danced in dozens of works, from Ailey's tour-de-force solo ''Cry'' to Rennie Harris's hip-hop workout ''Home.'' But she may be best known for her roles in ''Revelations,'' Ailey's evocation of the black church of his childhood, set to spirituals, that the company performs to unfailing ovations hundreds of times each year.
The first time Ms. Robinson saw her name on the callboard for the next day's rehearsal of ''Revelations,'' she couldn't sleep, she said. She wanted to be perfect. She picked out a special outfit. She recalled eagerly scanning the casting sheet at the beginning of each subsequent season and saving the sheet -- and the programs too -- each time she was entrusted with a new ''Revelations'' role. Ms. Robinson also remembers when she and few friends decided to put $5 into an envelope each time they performed ''Revelations,'' but she can't remember what happened to the envelope.
''Audiences know that dance,'' she said. ''They know it as well as you know it. It makes me feel good to take care of something that people like so much. The electricity that comes from the audience and that we give back to them, that happens every time. Who could get tired of that kind of vibration?''
In 1999, when the choreographer Ronald K. Brown cast Ms. Robinson as a mother goddess in his dance ''Grace'' (Ms. Robinson will perform the role when she receives a Dance Magazine Award on Dec. 3), he came in as a fan. ''But she had the humility of a great artist,'' Mr. Brown recalled. ''She told me she wanted to do a good job. She wanted to do the role the way I imagined it.''
In The New York Times, Gia Kourlas wrote that Mr. Brown had ''reinvented Ms. Robinson as a tough beauty, unfurling her wisdom,'' adding that ''her steps are fiercely calculated, but it's as if she's walking on air.''
More recently, when Mr. Brown was rehearsing the company in ''Grace,'' which returns to the active repertory this season, he admired how Ms. Robinson sat on the sidelines, not asserting her rank. ''But she wasn't just waiting her turn,'' he said. ''She was collecting information and digesting it. She watches like a hawk, and then she implements, always with a sense of discovery. That's how dancing lives in the moment.''
To younger dancers in the company Ms. Robinson has been a connection to the past and, as Alicia Graf Mack put it, ''the quintessential Ailey woman.'' But she's also been mother, coach, resource, rock and refuge. She has served as the company's unofficial nutritionist and fixer, convening ''body sessions'' in her hotel room on tour.
''She can see imbalances in your body,'' Mr. Rushing explained, just before eating a chicken lunch Ms. Robinson had cooked him. ''She works those out and the injuries just trickle away.''
Ms. Jamison, whose own dancing career with the company lasted 15 years, said: ''Renee could continue dancing forever. And I don't mean come out onstage and hold a pose. I've seen her go through ballets where she's been sick as a dog, but the audience didn't know. That's Renee. Renee does.''
Ms. Robinson's unquenchable curiosity, her work ethic: these are the qualities that her colleagues say have remained constant. And in her own view what has changed in the company are the costumes. ''You used have more fabric flowing around you,'' she said.
In the immediate future, she said, ''those costumes are small, and they are tight, and I'm getting ready for the performances I have'' -- 11 ''Revelations'' before her final one. And after that? ''They don't know,'' she said. ''But I'm a sneak back in.''

HEADLINE: Rising Seas, Vanishing Coastlines

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN STRAUSS and ROBERT KOPP. 
Benjamin Strauss is the chief operating officer and director of the program on sea level rise at Climate Central, a research group. Robert Kopp is an assistant professor of earth and planetary sciences at Rutgers University and associate director of the Rutgers Energy Institute.

 BODY:
THE oceans have risen and fallen throughout Earth's history, following the planet's natural temperature cycles. Twenty thousand years ago, what is now New York City was at the edge of a giant ice sheet, and the sea was roughly 400 feet lower. But as the last ice age thawed, the sea rose to where it is today.
Now we are in a new warming phase, and the oceans are rising again after thousands of years of stability. As scientists who study sea level change and storm surge, we fear that Hurricane Sandy gave only a modest preview of the dangers to come, as we continue to power our global economy by burning fuels that pollute the air with heat-trapping gases. 
This past summer, a disconcerting new scientific study by the climate scientist Michiel Schaeffer and colleagues -- published in the journal Nature Climate Change -- suggested that no matter how quickly we cut this pollution, we are unlikely to keep the seas from climbing less than five feet.
More than six million Americans live on land less than five feet above the local high tide. (Searchable maps and analyses are available at SurgingSeas.org for every low-lying coastal community in the contiguous United States.) Worse, rising seas raise the launching pad for storm surge, the thick wall of water that the wind can drive ahead of a storm. In a world with oceans that are five feet higher, our calculations show that New York City would average one flood as high as Hurricane Sandy's about every 15 years, even without accounting for the stronger storms and bigger surges that are likely to result from warming.
Floods reaching five feet above the current high tide line will become increasingly common along the nation's coastlines well before the seas climb by five feet. Over the last century, the nearly eight-inch rise of the world's seas has already doubled the chance of ''once in a century'' floods for many seaside communities.
We hope that with enough time, most of our great coastal cities and regions will be able to prepare for a five-foot increase. Some will not. Barriers that might work in Manhattan would be futile in South Florida, where water would pass underneath them by pushing through porous bedrock.
According to Dr. Schaeffer's study, immediate and extreme pollution cuts -- measures well beyond any discussion now under way -- could limit sea level rise to five feet over 300 years. If we stay on our current path, the oceans could rise five feet by the first half of next century, then continue rising even faster. If instead we make moderate shifts in energy and industry -- using the kinds of targets that nations have contemplated in international talks but have failed to pursue -- sea level could still climb past 12 feet just after 2300. It is hard to imagine what measures might allow many of our great coastal cities to survive a 12-foot increase.
WE might find comfort in the fact that this is just one set of projections, and projections are notoriously tough to get right. But a second study that also came out this past summer erases any such comfort.
Led by the geochemist Andrea Dutton and published in the journal Science, the second paper uses deep history, not model projections, for clues to the future. About 125,000 years ago, before the last ice age, there was a warm period that lasted 10,000 to 15,000 years. It was perhaps a little warmer than today, but cooler than the temperatures that climate scientists expect later in this century without sharp pollution cuts. Dr. Dutton's research strongly reinforces a prior study led by one of us, which found that the warm-period sea levels rose roughly 20 to 30 feet higher than those of today. We just don't have a clear picture of how fast that could happen again.
Any sea level forecast must be interpreted carefully: things could be better, or worse.
The Schaeffer study uses the relationship between global temperature and sea level over the past 1,000 years -- when it was cool, and the great ice sheets were generally stable -- to extrapolate over the next 300 years -- when it will be hot, and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may behave differently. Other scientific teams have tried the notoriously difficult task of forecasting ice sheet decay in physical detail, and this has tended to produce slower estimates of sea level rise than the Schaeffer team's method. But any projection is compromised by the fact that we are sending heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere far faster than anything the planet has seen for at least 55 million years.
The Dutton study comes with caveats, too. Earth's orbit was different during the last warm period, bringing more sunshine to the Arctic and complicating the analogy with today. But today we are on a path to a planet that will be much hotter than it was in the period Dr. Dutton studied.
There are two basic ways to protect ourselves from sea level rise: reduce it by cutting pollution, or prepare for it by defense and retreat. To do the job, we must do both. We have lost our chance for complete prevention; and preparation alone, without slowing emissions, would -- sooner or later -- turn our coastal cities into so many Atlantises.

HEADLINE: South Texas Leaders Keep Pushing for Medical School

BYLINE: By EMILY RAMSHAW. 
eramshaw@texastribune.org

 BODY:
When Travis County voters approved a ballot measure this month that paved the way for a new University of Texas medical school in Austin, many South Texans had to stifle their frustration and resentment. They had been trying for decades to secure financing for a medical school in the Rio Grande Valley, only to watch a wealthier area to the north seal a deal first.
Francisco Cigarroa, the chancellor of the University of Texas System, does not share those sentiments. With the wheels greased in Austin, Dr. Cigarroa said, he is even more confident that the Valley will get its medical school.
''This only gives me more resolve to get the South Texas school of medicine accomplished,'' he said. ''We've set the pathway for Austin. I'm not giving myself an 'A' on my report card unless I get this done.'' 
But his commitment is just one piece of the South Texas puzzle. And what has worked in Austin -- substantial public-private investment, financing set aside by the State Constitution for flagship institutions, and a voter-approved 5-cent property tax increase -- is not necessarily a fit in the Rio Grande Valley.
South Texas leaders must persuade hospitals to finance 120 residency slots, get local voters in the impoverished region to sign off on a taxing district, and -- the toughest but most critical selling point -- ask the cash-strapped Texas Legislature to provide $20 million a year.
''If you were going to pick a time in the history of the Texas budget to create a new medical school, this is probably not the time you would pick to do it,'' said R. K. Whittington, the president of the South Texas Medical Foundation. But with local support for the medical school growing and the economy improving, Mr. Whittington said, ''I'm more confident now than I was a year ago.''
The need is unquestionably there: studies show the fast-growing Valley, where the population is approaching 1.5 million, has 110 doctors per 100,000 people -- half the national rate and well below the state average. And the existing physicians are aging; at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance in Edinburg, which, along with other regional hospitals, would be a hub for medical residents under the South Texas plan, 38 percent of physicians will approach retirement in the next 5 to 10 years.
''We have many young people that forgo their plans, their dreams of becoming physicians, because it's a major sacrifice to leave the area,'' said Dr. Leonel Vela, the South Texas regional dean for the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Roughly 80 percent of all Texas medical school graduates stay and practice in the communities where they perform their residencies, but U.T. has just 33 medical residency slots in the Valley.
The University of Texas has long pledged to establish a medical school in South Texas, but residents there remain skeptical. The first bill to establish a South Texas medical school was introduced in the 1940s, Mr. Whittington said. And serious negotiations -- spurred by a severe shortage of physicians in the region, and an underserved population plagued by epidemics -- date back more than 20 years.
''We're the part of the state everyone ignores -- we basically get whatever's left over,'' said Alonzo Cantu, a Rio Grande Valley developer and the founder of Doctors Hospital at Renaissance. ''There's a lot of frustration, a lot of, 'Why them and not us?' ''
In the last decade, the U.T. system has made progress in South Texas; it established regional academic health centers in Harlingen and Edinburg -- precursors to a stand-alone medical school -- invested nearly $110 million in medical education infrastructure, and has provided clinical rotations for more than 1,000 medical students affiliated with the Health Science Center in San Antonio, though the majority of them must leave the Valley to complete their residencies.
State dollars and university system money are considered crucial to the plan in South Texas, where there are fewer options for creative financing and a relatively weak tax base.
In 2009, lawmakers passed legislation authorizing the establishment of a South Texas medical school, but did not attach any financing to it. Then last spring the U.T. System Board of Regents approved spending $30 million a year -- special financing set aside for flagship institutions -- to help establish an Austin medical school. At the same meeting, regents reaffirmed their commitment to turn the South Texas regional health centers into a free-standing medical school, but without additional spending.
For some South Texas leaders, the side-by-side resolutions amounted to a kick in the teeth.
''For a long time we felt we were first in line for the next medical school,'' said Senator Juan Hinojosa, Democrat of McAllen. ''But the Board of Regents was bending over backward to create a new medical school in Austin, and we felt like the bride left at the altar.''
By mid-August, some frustrated leaders and hospital executives were in College Station, discussing a possible South Texas medical school with John Sharp, the chancellor of the Texas A&M University System. Days after those conversations began, Dr. Cigarroa was in Edinburg, laying out a formal blueprint to graduate the first class of South Texas medical students by 2018. (The University of Texas at Austin, the Texas A&M University System and Doctors Hospital at Renaissance are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.)
Local leaders say that since then, the U.T. plan has gained momentum. ''I think they recognize that this is probably the train that is leaving the station,'' Mr. Whittington said.
And though Mr. Sharp declined to say whether conversations about an A&M medical school in South Texas were proceeding, he said A&M officials want to be sure that the region is ''given the respect and service to its citizens that its people deserve.''
Added Mr. Cantu: ''If a medical school is built down here, I think John Sharp had a lot to do with it.''
Dr. Cigarroa said the South Texas medical school plan never took a back seat to the Austin plan, citing the U.T. System's decade of financial investment in the region as evidence. It would be a mistake for the Valley to start splitting its medical school allegiances, he said.
''It's critically important that we're all in,'' he said. ''If we start dividing and diluting South Texas into various university systems, I'm not sure the Valley would get the full benefit.''
He and other university leaders stress that there is no one-size-fits-all financing formula for medical schools. While a taxing district is always a tough sell, Dr. Cigarroa said, if South Texans see progress -- like local hospitals expanding residency programs and more medical students treating patients in the Valley -- they will be more likely to support one.
He is also confident that lawmakers will come through with financing. Both Gov. Rick Perry and House Speaker Joe Straus have endorsed the concept of expanded access to medical education in South Texas, though they would not speak to specific budget appropriations.
But Mr. Hinojosa, the vice chairman of the Senate's budget-writing committee, is not convinced. ''To commit to $20 million a year under these economic circumstances,'' he said, ''and with the makeup of the Texas Legislature at this point, is not very realistic.''

HEADLINE: Slugging It Out, Inside Obama's Mind

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential campaign.

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT Washington, policy makers are debating how to avoid hitting a wall on Jan. 1, when large and abrupt tax increases and spending cuts will take effect automatically unless Congress acts. The debate is perhaps no more fervent than it is inside the head of our newly re-elected president, who must now decide what kind of policy leader he will become, both in this confrontation and throughout his second term.
Here is the dialogue, as I imagine it, between the two policy wonks -- the Moderate Obama and the Liberal Obama -- struggling for control of the president's soul.
THE MODERATE OBAMA: I am sure glad the election is behind us. I was really getting tired of giving all those platitudinous campaign speeches ... 
THE LIBERAL OBAMA: Yeah, me too.
MOD: ... and beating up on Bain Capital.
LIB: Actually, I enjoyed that. It's fun to make the plutocrats squirm.
MOD: The good news for the nation is that we can now resolve the budget impasse quickly and avoid the fiscal cliff.
LIB: Really? I don't see how.
MOD: Didn't you listen to Speaker Boehner's press conference the other day? He's finally conceded the need for more tax revenue. He is ready to throw Grover Norquist's tax pledge under the bus.
LIB: You think Boehner is ready to raise income tax rates for the rich? I don't think so.
MOD: Well, sure, he won't agree to increase tax rates, but he is ready to increase tax revenue by broadening the tax base. As long as the rich pay more, I don't care how we do it.
LIB: We tried negotiating this back in 2011, and nothing came of it. What's new here?
MOD: The election is over. The Republicans are ready to make a deal.
LIB: I'm not sure I believe that. But let's say it's true. Can we raise enough money that way?
MOD: According to the Tax Policy Center, if we cap itemized deductions at $50,000 and keep tax rates as they are today, we'd raise $749 billion in tax revenue over 10 years. And 96.2 percent of the extra revenue would come from the top fifth of taxpayers, with 79.9 percent from the top 1 percent.
LIB: I have a couple of concerns about that.
MOD: What?
LIB: First, if you limit deductions, people in high-tax states will be hit particularly hard, because state and local taxes are deductible.
MOD: Isn't that fair? I don't see why states and towns that choose to have very high taxes should be subsidized by everyone else.
LIB: These states generally have liberal agendas, which I want to encourage, not penalize. And many of them, like New York and California, vote Democratic. After they helped us win such a great victory, I don't think we should be asking our allies to bear a disproportionate share of the burden.
MOD: O.K., what's your other concern?
LIB: I don't think that $749 billion is enough revenue to solve the long-term fiscal problem.
MOD: By itself, it won't solve the problem. We'll need to combine it with reforms on the spending side. Maybe we should gradually but significantly increase the ages of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare.
LIB: Our signature achievement in the first term was to make the social safety net more generous with Obamacare. (I've really come to like that term.) I don't want to devote our second term to undermining the safety net by making Social Security and Medicare less generous.
MOD: But we promised a balanced approach. That meant raising taxes on the rich, together with substantial reductions in government spending.
LIB: We should start by cutting military spending.
MOD: Maybe, but that's not the main source of our long-term fiscal imbalance. Spending on entitlements is.
LIB: Then why don't we focus on bending the cost curve for health care?
MOD: Sure, everyone would like to pay less for health care without reducing its availability or quality. But it's not so easy.
LIB: We have lots of great ideas: increased preventive care, greater reliance on health information technology, more research on the cost effectiveness of alternative procedures.
MOD: That all sounds good, but it ultimately might not amount to very much savings. I am afraid that you're being tempted by wishful thinking.
LIB: We've barely started. Look at Europe. They have a more robust social safety net than we do.
MOD: True, but they pay for it by taxing the middle class more heavily. They impose a value-added tax, for example. We just promised that we wouldn't raise middle-class taxes. Besides, Europe's fiscal picture doesn't look very pretty, either.
LIB: Then we'll just have to raise taxes on the rich even more.
MOD: What are you proposing?
LIB: We can both broaden the base and raise the top tax rates. The economist Peter Diamond, whom we tried to appoint to the Federal Reserve, has calculations suggesting that the top tax rate should be 73 percent. That is close to the 75 percent rate that President Hollande of France is now pursuing.
MOD: Are you nuts? I don't want to become France.
LIB: We don't have to go that far, but we can go higher than where we are now. California just created a new tax rate for married couples earning more than $1 million a year and singles earning more than $500,000. Maybe the federal government should do the same thing.
MOD: California is not exactly a role model for sound fiscal policy.
LIB: True, the state has had its problems. But it is now coming to grips with them, in a progressive way.
MOD: Let's face facts: It's impossible to resolve our fiscal imbalance just by taxing the rich more. The gap between spending and revenue is too big. If we are going to avoid much higher middle-class taxes, we need fundamental entitlement reform. Also, we need to keep Speaker Boehner on board. Even if he wanted to, he could never get the House Republicans to agree to a tax increase as large as you want.
LIB: We've got leverage now. If the House doesn't cave, we can threaten to go over the cliff. The economy would most likely head into another recession, but we could blame it on the Republicans. That prospect should scare them into line.
MOD: Are you really sure that's the mandate we got from the election?

HEADLINE: Daphne Wang, Barry Greenberg

BYLINE: By NINA REYES

 BODY:
Daphne Wang and Barry Saul Greenberg were married Saturday in Saratoga, Calif. Bruce C. Juell, who became a Universal Life minister for this ceremony, officiated at Montalvo Arts Center.
Ms. Wang, 31, will keep her name. She is an associate director for corporate communications in the New York office of APCO Worldwide, a Washington public affairs and strategic communications firm. From 1995 to 2008, she was a professional violinist; her most recent performance was in February 2010 at the concert hall at University of Southern California. 
She graduated and received a master's degree in violin performance from Johns Hopkins University, and received a master's degree in strategic public relations and a doctoral degree in violin performance from U.S.C. In 2004, she was awarded violin fellowships at the National University of Singapore that were sponsored by the university and Johns Hopkins.
She is the daughter of Jinye C. Wang and Yun Wang of Saratoga. The bride's father is an I.B.M. fellow, serving as the chief technology officer for the research division in China of I.B.M.; he works in Beijing. Her mother is a piano teacher in Saratoga.
Mr. Greenberg, 39, is a Foreign Service officer for the State Department and is on a temporary joint duty assignment in Los Angeles, assisting the military with logistics. He graduated from Duke and received a master's in international relations and international economics from Johns Hopkins.
He is a son of Lia H. Greenberg and Raymond I. Greenberg of North Potomac, Md. The groom's mother retired as a French and Spanish teacher at Quince Orchard High School in Gaithersburg, Md. His father, a nuclear chemist, retired from the Energy Department office in Germantown, Md., where he managed nuclear-waste cleanup projects. He is the president of the Maryland State Youth Soccer Association, which is in Glen Burnie, Md.
The couple were introduced in 2004, when Mr. Greenberg, who was working for Johns Hopkins on the establishment of a classical-music conservatory at the National University of Singapore, sent Ms. Wang an e-mail asking if she might be interested in one of the violin fellowships.
Their first face-to-face meeting was at Singapore's airport. ''I think it was love at first sight,'' Ms. Wang said. NINA REYES

HEADLINE: Paying For Future Catastrophes

BYLINE: By ERWANN MICHEL-KERJAN and HOWARD KUNREUTHER. 
Erwann Michel-Kerjan and Howard Kunreuther teach at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and are co-authors of ''At War with the Weather.''

 BODY:
Philadelphia
HURRICANE SANDY could cost the nation a staggering $50 billion, about a third of the cost of Hurricane Katrina -- to date the most costly disaster in United States history.
But Hurricane Sandy was not an isolated event. Indeed, the incidence of extreme events is far more frequent. Twenty of the 30 most expensive insured catastrophes worldwide from 1970 to 2011 have occurred since 2001 -- and 13 of them were in the United States. Aside from the 9/11 terrorist attacks, all were natural disasters. The increase is most likely because of the location in high-risk areas of more people, and more valuable properties, along with a changing climate.
What's next? And who will pay? 
Schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, utilities and transportation services are primarily rebuilt with federal funds through the Stafford Act, with 25 percent picked up by state and local governments.
For families and businesses, insurance plays an important role in assisting financial recovery. However many people, including those in high-risk areas, don't have coverage, either put off by its cost or by the belief that the next disaster ''will not happen to me.'' Ninety percent of Californians, for example, are without earthquake coverage.
Because of the quickening pace of disaster, those who want insurance or are required to buy it now face much higher costs in risky areas. Premiums for homeowners' insurance (which covers wind damage) doubled in Florida between 2002 and 2007, tripling in some areas after the 2004-5 hurricane seasons, if insurance was available at all.
Many insurers have raised their premiums because of increased risk estimates, higher cost of reinsurance (insurers transfer part of their risk to international reinsurers), the requirement by regulators and rating agencies that insurers hold more capital in order to reduce the likelihood of insolvency, and the need to provide shareholders with an attractive return.
In response to this insurance crisis, several states developed state-run wind insurance pools intended to serve as insurers of last resort. These institutions typically offer hurricane coverage for residences in high-risk areas at a much lower premium than coverage provided by the private market. Today, the largest wind pool, Citizens, covers nearly $500 billion of assets and has the biggest market share of all homeowner insurers in Florida.
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas also have such wind pools, although they're much smaller.
These hybrid mechanisms are obviously popular: homeowners pay less than if they purchased private insurance, builders have an easier time selling properties in hazard-prone areas since insurance premiums are kept artificially low, and elected officials look good, having ''solved'' the problem.
The untold story, however, is that all insurance policyholders in the state will be forced to pay if the pool does not have enough funding to honor its claims, which is most likely when the next large-scale disaster hits.
Those who live in nonrisky areas are subsidizing the choices of others. Take residential flood insurance. Most insurers refuse to cover the risk, so the National Flood Insurance Program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was established in 1968 with subsidized rates for those then living in flood-prone areas.
Today, the program covers 5.6 million policyholders, who are paying an average of $55 per month. About one million of them are still getting flood insurance for less than half price because the house was built before the flood hazard maps were established.
So it is unsurprising that the program had to borrow $18 billion from the United States Treasury to pay for its claims after the historic 2005 and 2008 hurricane seasons, an amount it has yet to pay back. It will have to borrow even more after Hurricane Sandy.
But even with a subsidized premium, many people drop coverage. (Banks might require it, but apparently if they do, they are not always enforcing that provision.) Our research shows that half of all policyholders cancel their flood coverage after only three or four years. Why? Because they paid premiums without getting anything in return and are likely to think ''Bad investment!'' But insurance is a safety net, not a bet.
UNINSURED disaster victims have to rely on family, friends or donations; apply for limited federal individual assistance grants; or take on low-interest disaster loans, if they qualify. Although the number of presidential disaster declarations prompting federal relief is at a record high (99 declarations last year alone), the truth is that most of that money goes to affected states to rebuild their public assets, not to individual victims. The status quo is unacceptable: our already fragile economy cannot afford more of those huge losses from extreme events. A more coherent strategy can encourage personal responsibility and proper protection.
First, premiums should reflect risk. This makes transparent the magnitude of the hazards one faces and could limit new construction in high-risk areas. Residents would be encouraged to reduce risk by getting discounts for, say, elevating a house or strengthening the roof.
Second, we should address equity and affordability. If premiums are risk-based, those who live in hazard-prone areas and cannot afford insurance will require assistance. We propose establishing a federal disaster insurance means-tested voucher program similar to the food stamp program.
We also propose having multiyear disaster insurance contracts with rates locked in so that customers won't capriciously abandon their contracts after a couple of years without a disaster. Currently contracts are for a single year. The multiyear contracts would be attached directly to the property, not the individual, and could be complemented by a home improvement loan for financing loss-reduction measures.
A presidential commission tasked with redesigning our national disaster financing strategy could quantify risk in dollar terms and make it very clear who was responsible for what -- whether private or public risk was involved.
Let's act while attention is still focused on avoiding the consequences of another Hurricane Sandy.

HEADLINE: Speaking Volumes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES. 
William Grimes, a domestic correspondent for The Times, is the author of ''Appetite City: A Culinary History of New York.''

 BODY:
For most of human history, literature was transmitted orally from storyteller to listener. In theory, therefore, a book read by an actor or an author should feel like the most natural thing in the world.
In reality, the book-length recitation turns out to be a very tricky medium. A good reader can lift a mediocre book above its station. A bad reader can ruin a masterpiece. And there are all kinds of variation in between: A so-so book rich with incident and characters can delight, while a good book can be good in the wrong ways, with sumptuous, tightly written sentences that make it almost impossible to stick with, especially for listeners who are driving, or making dinner -- which is to say, most of the intended audience. 
A prime example of a good book defeated by the format is TELEGRAPH AVENUE (Harper Audio, $44.99), Michael Chabon's teeming novel about race, human relations and a lot of other stuff swirling around a vintage record store in Oakland, Calif. The language is dense, allusive, hip and sharp, which is to say, very difficult to perform. Clarke Peters, who played Detective Lester Freamon on the television series ''The Wire'' and Big Chief Lambreaux on ''Treme,'' picks his way carefully through this minefield, articulating painstakingly in the sonorous, low-pitched voice of a late-night D.J. on a progressive jazz station. It's a swinging style, perfectly attuned to the novel's setting and falls easily on the ear, but Chabon's relentlessly brilliant prose style makes heavy demands on performer and listener alike. By the second disc in a marathon that goes on for more than 18 hours, the thought arises that some books simply need to be experienced in black type.
Assigning an author to recite his own material also carries risks. It's like putting a defendant on the stand. Things could go either way.
Junot Díaz takes the plunge in THIS IS HOW YOU LOSE HER (Penguin Audio, $29.95), his second collection of stories, and the gamble pays off. In the stories narrated by his alter ego, Yunior, he falls naturally into the wisecracking, skeptical idiom punctuated with Dominican Spanish that makes his written work feel as if it was meant to be performed vocally all along.
Díaz embodies that voice, importuning, emphatic and mournful by turns. It puts the listener in the position of confidant, one of the narrator's neighborhood pals hearing him out as he catalogs his latest series of amorous misadventures. The wit, pungent and streetwise on the page, gets an added charge from the author's keyed-up vocal style and distinct New Jersey accent. Readers who do not speak Spanish can only approximate the linguistic blend as they follow the written text. Listeners get the music in all frequencies.
Audiobooks often find their best material at the submasterpiece level. Just as potboilers, brainless best-sellers and pulp fiction can translate brilliantly into film, second-order fiction can mesmerize on audiodisc, with the right performance.
So it is with Tom Wolfe's BACK TO BLOOD (Little, Brown, $39.98), his sprawling, raucous novel about ethnic tensions and politics in modern Miami, and with J. K. Rowling's first novel for adults, THE CASUAL VACANCY (Little, Brown, $49.98). Most critics agreed ''Back to Blood'' is no ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' but they recognized its fun factor: a twisty plot, a rogue's gallery of colorful characters, an acidic take on modern mores and tastes. This is virtually a recipe for good audiobook listening.
Lou Diamond Phillips, the reader, plays it straight delivering the narration. This is a wise decision, since it's almost impossible to imagine the correct tone for Wolfe's needling, mocking prose. He gives the main character, a Miami cop named Nestor Camacho, a Spanish-tinged American accent that wears well over the course of a very long novel, and cuts loose when impersonating characters like Flebetnikov, a Russian oligarch, and Norman Lewis, a narcissistic, insecure pornography-addiction therapist. True, the Russians sound like Count Dracula, but Phillips comes up with a hilarious interpretation of Lewis's convulsive, phlegmy laugh, rendered by Wolfe, in one passage, as ''haaahhsarrrghhHHHock hock hock.''
The snap, crackle and pop effects that Wolfe loves to sprinkle over his prose can be amusing in printed form, but they are annoying to hear. Still, Phillips makes the most of the incessant ''I would'' -- heaving stress on the first word -- that local Romeos utter each time a girl in a bikini passes by, rendering this cameo phrase richly moronic, and funnier each time he says it.
Rowling, taking a new turn after her series of Harry Potter books, has written a state-of-England novel in the grand Victorian tradition, set in the little town of Pagford. The cast of characters is endless, the social comedy genuinely funny and the plot fast-paced.
Tom Hollander, a well-respected English character actor who played Mr. Collins in the 2005 film version of ''Pride and Prejudice,'' throws himself on this material like a starving man on a juicy rib-eye steak. Hollander conjures Rowling's throng with no assistance whatsoever.
Narrating in a dry, droll tone, he jumps effortlessly from the West Country plainspeak of Howard Mollison, a deli owner, to the smoker's raps of his garrulous business partner, Maureen Lowe, to the teenage snarl of Krystal Weedon, the local bad girl. The whispery, listless voice he uses for Krystal's drug-addicted mother is truly frightening. The novel clicks right along, too short even at 15 discs.
Self-effacement is one of the underrated virtues in the world of audiobooks. A distinctive tone, pitch or accent can be a drawback over the long haul, and few hauls are longer than the 18 discs of WOLF HALL (Macmillan Audio, $49.99). The novel, published in 2009, is the first installment in Hilary Mantel's trilogy-in-process about Thomas Cromwell and the reign of Henry VIII. (The second volume, ''Bring Up the Bodies,'' was released earlier this year.)
Simon Slater ingratiates with a mellifluous English baritone well suited to this arduous task. His foreign accents, usually a broad interpretation of Spanish or French, recall a bit of Monty Python, but he does wonders with Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell's witty and worldly mentor, whose plummy voice seems to come straight from Robert Morley's cinematic rendition of Oscar Wilde.
The style of ''Wolf Hall,'' portentous in every phrase and sentence, is tough on Slater. So is the crawling pace, which is beyond any performer's power to push or prod. What Samuel Johnson said of ''Paradise Lost'' certainly applies here: ''None ever wished it longer than it is.''
Another recent novel, Ann Patchett's 2011 STATE OF WONDER (Harper Audio, $39.99), fares much better, and in Hope Davis finds what may be its ideal reader. The actress, known for her roles in films like ''About Schmidt'' and in HBO series like ''Mildred Pierce'' and ''In Treatment,'' relies on slight changes in register or tone to lock into a character's emotions.
It is a thrilling, economical performance. A stilted delivery captures the essence of Annick Swenson, the imperious, elusive medical researcher whom the narrator must track down in the Amazon. By dropping her voice just a bit, and adopting the precise, courtly speech manner of a foreign speaker of English, she summons Milton, a Brazilian guide. It comes as a shock when Davis cuts loose with an Australian accent for Barbara Bovender, an impetuous young Bohemian stranded in Manaus, Brazil.
Once in a blue moon, an audiobook leaves you wondering if it might actually be a disappointment to read the book. This is one of them.

HEADLINE: Skills Don't Pay the Bills

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Earlier this month, hoping to understand the future of the moribund manufacturing job market, I visited the engineering technology program at Queensborough Community College in New York City. I knew that advanced manufacturing had become reliant on computers, yet the classroom I visited had nothing but computers. As the instructor Joseph Goldenberg explained, today's skilled factory worker is really a hybrid of an old-school machinist and a computer programmer. Goldenberg's intro class starts with the basics of how to use cutting tools to shape a raw piece of metal. Then the real work begins: students learn to write the computer code that tells a machine how to do it much faster.
Nearly six million factory jobs, almost a third of the entire manufacturing industry, have disappeared since 2000. And while many of these jobs were lost to competition with low-wage countries, even more vanished because of computer-driven machinery that can do the work of 10, or in some cases, 100 workers. Those jobs are not coming back, but many believe that the industry's future (and, to some extent, the future of the American economy) lies in training a new generation for highly skilled manufacturing jobs -- the ones that require people who know how to run the computer that runs the machine. 
This is partly because advanced manufacturing is really complicated. Running these machines requires a basic understanding of metallurgy, physics, chemistry, pneumatics, electrical wiring and computer code. It also requires a worker with the ability to figure out what's going on when the machine isn't working properly. And aspiring workers often need to spend a considerable amount of time and money taking classes like Goldenberg's to even be considered. Every one of Goldenberg's students, he says, will probably have a job for as long as he or she wants one.
And yet, even as classes like Goldenberg's are filled to capacity all over America, hundreds of thousands of U.S. factories are starving for skilled workers. Throughout the campaign, President Obama lamented the so-called skills gap and referenced a study claiming that nearly 80 percent of manufacturers have jobs they can't fill. Mitt Romney made similar claims. The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that there are roughly 600,000 jobs available for whoever has the right set of advanced skills.
Eric Isbister, the C.E.O. of GenMet, a metal-fabricating manufacturer outside Milwaukee, told me that he would hire as many skilled workers as show up at his door. Last year, he received 1,051 applications and found only 25 people who were qualified. He hired all of them, but soon had to fire 15. Part of Isbister's pickiness, he says, comes from an avoidance of workers with experience in a ''union-type job.'' Isbister, after all, doesn't abide by strict work rules and $30-an-hour salaries. At GenMet, the starting pay is $10 an hour. Those with an associate degree can make $15, which can rise to $18 an hour after several years of good performance. From what I understand, a new shift manager at a nearby McDonald's can earn around $14 an hour.
The secret behind this skills gap is that it's not a skills gap at all. I spoke to several other factory managers who also confessed that they had a hard time recruiting in-demand workers for $10-an-hour jobs. ''It's hard not to break out laughing,'' says Mark Price, a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center, referring to manufacturers complaining about the shortage of skilled workers. ''If there's a skill shortage, there has to be rises in wages,'' he says. ''It's basic economics.'' After all, according to supply and demand, a shortage of workers with valuable skills should push wages up. Yet according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of skilled jobs has fallen and so have their wages.
In a recent study, the Boston Consulting Group noted that, outside a few small cities that rely on the oil industry, there weren't many places where manufacturing wages were going up and employers still couldn't find enough workers. ''Trying to hire high-skilled workers at rock-bottom rates,'' the Boston Group study asserted, ''is not a skills gap.'' The study's conclusion, however, was scarier. Many skilled workers have simply chosen to apply their skills elsewhere rather than work for less, and few young people choose to invest in training for jobs that pay fast-food wages. As a result, the United States may soon have a hard time competing in the global economy. The average age of a highly skilled factory worker in the U.S. is now 56. ''That's average,'' says Hal Sirkin, the lead author of the study. ''That means there's a lot who are in their 60s. They're going to retire soon.'' And there are not enough trainees in the pipeline, he said, to replace them.
One result, Sirkin suggests, is that the fake skills gap is threatening to create a real skills gap. Goldenberg, who has taught for more than 20 years, is already seeing it up close. Few of his top students want to work in factories for current wages.
Isbister is seeing the other side of this decision making. He was deeply frustrated when his company participated in a recent high-school career fair. Any time a student expressed interest in manufacturing, he said, ''the parents came over and asked: 'Are you going to outsource? Move the jobs to China?' '' While Isbister says he thinks that his industry suffers from a reputation problem, he also admitted that his answer to a nervous parent's question is not reassuring. The industry is inevitably going to move some of these jobs to China, or it's going to replace them with machines. If it doesn't, it can't compete on a global level.
It's easy to understand every perspective in this drama. Manufacturers, who face increasing competition from low-wage countries, feel they can't afford to pay higher wages. Potential workers choose more promising career paths. ''It's individually rational,'' says Howard Wial, an economist at the Brookings Institution who specializes in manufacturing employment. ''But it's not socially optimal.'' In earlier decades, Wial says, manufacturing workers could expect decent-paying jobs that would last a long time, and it was easy to match worker supply and demand. Since then, with the confluence of computers, increased trade and weakened unions, the social contract has collapsed, and worker-employer matches have become harder to make. Now workers and manufacturers ''need to recreate a system'' -- a new social contract -- in which their incentives are aligned.
In retrospect, the post-World War II industrial model did a remarkably good job of supporting a system in which an 18-year-old had access to on-the-job training that was nearly certain to pay off over a long career. That system had its flaws -- especially a shared complacency that left manufacturers and laborers unprepared for global trade and technological change. Manufacturers, of course, have responded over the past 20 years by dismantling it. Yet Isbister's complaint suggests some hope -- that there's a lack of skilled workers; that factory layoffs overshot, and now need a reversal. As we talked, it became clear that Isbister's problem is part of a larger one. Isbister told me that he's ready to offer training to high-school graduates, some of whom, he says, will eventually make good money. The problem, he finds, is that far too few graduate high school with the basic math and science skills that his company needs to compete. As he spoke, I realized that this isn't a narrow problem facing the manufacturing industry. The so-called skills gap is really a gap in education, and that affects all of us.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. There is no skills gap.
2. Who will operate a highly sophisticated machine for $10 an hour?
3. Not a lot of people.
4. As a result, there is going to be a skills gap.

HEADLINE: Hatching Ideas, and Companies, By the Dozens at M.I.T.

BYLINE: By HANNAH SELIGSON

 BODY:
HOW do you take particles in a test tube, or components in a tiny chip, and turn them into a $100 million company?
Dr. Robert Langer, 64, knows how. Since the 1980s, his Langer Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has spun out companies whose products treat cancer, diabetes, heart disease and schizophrenia, among other diseases, and even thicken hair.
The Langer Lab is on the front lines of turning discoveries made in the lab into a range of drugs and drug delivery systems. Without this kind of technology transfer, the thinking goes, scientific discoveries might well sit on the shelf, stifling innovation.
A chemical engineer by training, Dr. Langer has helped start 25 companies and has 811 patents, issued or pending, to his name. More than 250 companies have licensed or sublicensed Langer Lab patents. 
Polaris Venture Partners, a Boston venture capital firm, has invested $220 million in 18 Langer Lab-inspired businesses. Combined, these businesses have improved the health of many millions of people, says Terry McGuire, co-founder of Polaris.
Along the way, Dr. Langer and his lab, including about 60 postdoctoral and graduate students at a time, have found a way to navigate some slippery territory: the intersection of academic research and the commercial market.
Over the last 30 years, many universities -- including M.I.T. -- have set up licensing offices that oversee the transfer of scientific discoveries to companies. These offices have become a major pathway for universities seeking to put their research to practical use, not to mention add to their revenue streams.
In the sciences in particular, technology transfer has become a key way to bring drugs and other treatments to market. ''The model of biomedical innovation relies on research coming out of universities, often funded by public money,'' says Josephine Johnston, director of research at the Hastings Center, a bioethics research organization based in Garrison, N.Y.
Just a few of the products that have emerged from the Langer Lab are a small wafer that delivers a dose of chemotherapy used to treat brain cancer; sugar-sequencing tools that can be used to create new drugs like safer and more effective blood thinners; and a miniaturized chip (a form of nanotechnology) that can test for diseases.
The chemotherapy wafer, called the Gliadel, is licensed by Eisai Inc. The company behind the sugar-sequencing tools, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, raised $28.4 million in an initial public offering in 2004. The miniaturized chip is made by T2Biosystems, which completed a $23 million round of financing in the summer of 2011.
''It's inconvenient to have to send things to a lab,'' so the company is trying to develop more sophisticated methods, says Dr. Ralph Weissleder, a co-founder, with Dr. Langer and others, of T2Biosystems and a professor at Harvard Medical School.
FOR Dr. Langer, starting a company is not the same as it was, say, for Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook. ''Bob is not consumed with any one company,'' says H. Kent Bowen, an emeritus professor of business administration at Harvard Business School who wrote a case study on the Langer Lab. ''His mission is to create the idea.''
Dr. Bowen observes that there are many other academic laboratories, including highly productive ones, but that the Langer Lab's combination of people, spun-out companies and publications sets it apart. He says Dr. Langer ''walks into the great unknown and then makes these discoveries.''
Dr. Langer is well known for his mentoring abilities. He is ''notorious for replying to e-mail in two minutes, whether it's a lowly graduate school student or the president of the United States,'' says Paulina Hill, who worked in his lab from 2009 to 2011 and is now a senior associate at Polaris Venture Partners. (According to Dr. Langer, he has corresponded directly with President Obama about stem cell research and federal funds for the sciences.)
Dr. Langer says he looks at his students ''as an extended family,'' adding that ''I really want them to do well.''
And they have, whether in business or in academia, or a combination of the two. One former student, Ram Sasisekharan, helped found Momenta and now runs his own lab at M.I.T. Ganesh Venkataraman Kaundinya is Momenta's chief scientific officer and senior vice president for research.
Hongming Chen is vice president of research at Kala Pharmaceuticals. Howard Bernstein is chief scientific officer at Seventh Sense Biosystems, a blood-testing company. Still others have taken jobs in the law or in government.
Dr. Langer says he spends about eight hours a week working on companies that come out of his lab. Of the 25 that he helped start, he serves on the boards of 12 and is an informal adviser to 4. All of his entrepreneurial activity, which includes some equity stakes, has made him a millionaire. But he says he is mainly motivated by a desire to improve people's health.
Operating from the sixth floor of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research on the M.I.T. campus in Cambridge, Mass., Dr. Langer's lab has a research budget of more than $10 million for 2012, coming mostly from federal sources.
The research in labs like Dr. Langer's is eyed closely by pharmaceutical companies. While drug companies employ huge research and development teams, they may not be as freewheeling and nimble, Dr. Langer says. The basis for many long-range discoveries has ''come out of academia, including gene therapy, gene sequencing and tissue engineering,'' he says.
He has served as a consultant to pharmaceutical companies. Their large size, he says, can end up being an impediment.
''Very often when you are going for real innovation,'' he says, ''you have to go against prevailing wisdom, and it's hard to go against prevailing wisdom when there are people who have been there for a long time and you have some vice president who says, 'No, that doesn't make sense.' ''
Pharmaceutical companies are eager to tap into the talent at leading research universities. In 2008, for example, Washington University in St. Louis announced a $25 million pact with Pfizer to collaborate more closely on biomedical research.
But in some situations, the close -- critics might say cozy -- ties between business and academia have the potential to create conflicts of interest.
There was a controversy earlier this year when it was revealed that the president of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center owned stock in Aveo Oncology, which had announced earlier that the university would be leading clinical trials of one of its cancer drugs. Last month, the University of Texas announced that he would be allowed to keep his ties with three pharmaceutical companies, including Aveo Oncology; his holdings will be placed in a blind trust.
''One question is how much is the commercial interest driving the research,'' Ms. Johnston says. ''I think that universities and the public policy makers are a little unsure where they think the balance should be. Does this opportunity skew the research agenda in terms of commercial application instead of the public interest?'' She was speaking generally, and not commenting on any particular institution.
Dr. Langer says that there is no pressure at his lab for students to turn their research into a business. In fact, he says, about half of his students stay in academia. ''I feel like one of our successes is that we trained so many great people who are now teaching at universities,'' he says, adding that strict ethics rules are in place to prevent conflicts.
If they remain in academia, scientists at M.I.T. can still take equity stakes in the companies that their discoveries helped form. But they are barred from owning shares in any company that provides a research grant to their lab. They also cannot be executives of a company, although they can serve as paid advisers.
One issue at the crux of technology transfer is: How do universities protect the public good?
''M.I.T. always reserves rights for all nonprofit institutions, noncommercial research and education,'' says Lita Nelsen, director of M.I.T.'s Technology Licensing Office, who has helped the Langer Lab file for hundreds of patents, close to 80 percent of which have been approved.
As an example, a controlled-release polio vaccine developed in the Langer Lab was financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for use in the developing world. The foundation has also arranged to use, through Seventh Sense Biosystems, a rapid way to draw blood with a microneedle patch that could be used outside the confines of a medical center. (The approach is still in human trials.) The Langer Lab has also been working with the United States Army on a regenerative-tissue project that would help wounded soldiers from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
When a discovery is licensed at M.I.T., the university splits the profit three ways -- among the department where the discovery was made, the university and the inventors.
''The founding principle in 1861, when M.I.T. was created, was to provide and support the industrialization of America. I always say we were founded on the principle of tech transfer,'' says Susan Hockfield, who served as M.I.T.'s president from December 2004 until June of this year.
David H. Koch, executive vice president of Koch Industries, the conglomerate based in Wichita, Kan., wrote in an e-mail that ''innovation and education have long fueled the world's most powerful economies, so I can't think of a better or more natural synergy than the one between academia and industry.'' Mr. Koch endowed Dr. Langer's professorship at M.I.T. and is a graduate of the university.
YES, many of the Langer Lab's discoveries are helping to fight disease. But you can't say that about a hair-thickening product that is made by a company called Living Proof. The product is sold at stores like Nordstrom and Sephora; Dr. Langer serves on the company's board and holds a small equity stake.
How did he end up in the hair care business? That discovery actually came from a way to create new materials, the original intent of which was to treat prostate and ovarian cancer. Various chemical compounds, however, could be fished out from the discovery for many different purposes, including a hair thickening product.
Of course, not everything that comes out of the lab is a sure bet. A drug may not make it past clinical trials, or an alternative treatment may prove more effective.
Dr. Langer is still assessing the commercial potential of a project involving the vocal cords. He and Dr. Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation, who has operated on singers like Adele and Julie Andrews, developed a gel that can be used on vocal tubes to make them more pliable. The gel had promising results in clinical trials on dogs, according to Dr. Langer. ''I don't know if it's a company, though,'' he says.
But he favors the kind of research that takes chances. As Dr. Bowen of Harvard says of Dr. Langer's students: ''They all come away thinking nothing is impossible.''

HEADLINE: Side by Side, Yes; Carbon Copies, Never

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
JAZZING up the look of homes comes with the territory in Springfield Gardens, a midsize middle-class enclave in southeastern Queens 14 miles from Manhattan.
Its Capes, with their basic triangle-on-a-rectangle forms, were probably carbon copies of one another when built 60 years ago. But in the years since, they have accrued a wealth of individualizing details.
There is circle-patterned siding in grays and browns, evoking stone walls in the country. There are dove, lion and elephant figurines, white as alabaster, animating the tops of fences. And then there are the bright chrome and gold railings, glittering like mirrors. All of which helps guarantee that no two properties end up too much alike.
In many ways, putting an expressive stamp on the area has also been an act of celebration on the part of the African-American population that migrated here from Manhattan and Brooklyn from the 1940s through the '60s. Trading cramped apartments in run-down areas for roomy spreads in just-built neighborhoods bordered on a cathartic experience, some veterans of that era explain. 
''It was really opening up racially back then, and it was exciting to be here,'' said Julia Rinehardt, who in the 1950s, after her wedding, decided to say goodbye to her Harlem rental and relocate to Springfield Gardens.
Ms. Rinehardt's two-family colonial, built in the 1920s, provided plenty of space to raise three children. But it also, she said, connected her to her history: before World War II, when her family moved to New York to find work, they had had a similar house in Jacksonville, Fla.
True to neighborhood form, the six-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath house is colorful. The squash-toned top stories are paired with a henna one below. And red and white paint stripes the brick wall out front.
In 1957 the house cost $17,000, said Ms. Rinehardt, 89, who worked for the city's Department of Social Services. Today it might bring $400,000, she said, basing her estimate on a recent appraisal.
Civil servants also flocked to Rochdale Village, a 5,860-unit Mitchell-Lama co-op that opened in 1963 and was the country's largest until Co-op City went up in the Bronx some years later.
Sprawling across a 20-building campus, Rochdale was founded with strict rules to guarantee affordability. Even today, the top allowable income for a family of six in a three-bedroom is $148,000.
In the early 1960s, Nesbitt Benjamin was living in an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He was tantalized by Rochdale's stated mission to provide a clean, safe and racially heterogeneous environment.
In 1964, for a $5,000 down payment and about $125 a month, Mr. Benjamin was awarded a two-bedroom one-bath apartment at Rochdale, with a terrace that provides views of Coney Island.
At first the racial balance was impressive: of the seven units on his floor, white families lived in four, and black families in three. Today there's a white family in one unit, and black families in six, roughly in line with the mix in the area, but any ebb in diversity is hardly a reason to leave.
''It has been a joy to be here,'' said Mr. Benjamin, 80, who is retired from a career with the Transit Police. ''This is the best place in the world.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
The diamond-shaped neighborhood, which covers nearly three square miles, is crisscrossed by busy boulevards.
In between are quieter blocks, lined with sidewalks, trees and a few lawns; some seem more like the suburban Springfield in ''The Simpsons'' than any New York City place. Indeed, one half expects to meet a resident who lives on the corner of Maple and Main, rather than 140th Avenue and 170th Street.
On two occasions, in 2005 and again in 2011, the city rezoned parts of the area to preserve its low-slung profile, though developers have made incursions. Newer multifamilies with four units packed under one roof face 141st Avenue, for example, across from more spacious standalone properties.
The population of 52,000 is about 90 percent black, according to census data. Many are from the Caribbean, or have relatives who are; Jamaica, Haiti and Trinidad are well represented.
Twenty years ago, violent crime was severe, though it has mellowed somewhat. In 1993 there were 39 murders in the 113th Precinct, which also covers higher-crime South Jamaica; in 2001 the number was 10, according to New York Police Department figures. Last year there were 17, and this year 16 so far.
Residents point to the positive trends. And many praise the Springfield Gardens United Methodist Church, a parish that dates to the late 1800s. Its pastor, Cecil B. Stone, they say, has led a push in the last two decades to get more young parishioners to attend college.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
In mid-November there were 98 homes for sale in the 11413 ZIP code, which covers about half the neighborhood; the average list price was $364,000, according to data from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.
The properties ranged from a detached one-family colonial, near busy 147th Avenue, at $129,000, to a detached two-family colonial, with seven bedrooms and three and a half baths, at $650,000. Separately, at Rochdale, one-bedrooms start at $7,200, with about $700 in monthly charges.
There were dozens more listings for sale in the Springfield Gardens section of the 11434 ZIP code, with similar features and prices, according to the listing service. Taken together, the two zones had at least 150 homes on the market. But one wouldn't glean that by driving around, because for-sale signs are almost totally absent.
The signs more in evidence are the red-and-white ones advertising ''Cash -- We Buy Houses,'' and their presence may hint at why sales aren't more prominently advertised: brokers say many owners are selling under duress, having fallen behind on mortgage payments, and they don't want to advertise their predicaments with signs.
Many of those troubled loans, which stem from subprime mortgages, have earned Springfield Gardens and its surroundings a dubious distinction, housing data reveal: one of the most foreclosure-racked parts in the city. In fact, during the depths of the recession in 2009, hundreds of new foreclosure filings were recorded there monthly. Moreover, neither of those years saw any single-family home sales in the neighborhood, according to data from Paul Miller, a sales agent with Cross Island Real Estate.
Things on the foreclosure front have settled down -- more or less. There were 42 new filings in October, versus 5 in October 2011, according to RealtyTrac, the data company. But a RealtyTrac analyst pointed out that recent citywide numbers are up, too, and that the spike largely means years-old cases are finally making their way through the court system.
So far this year 12 houses have sold, at an average of $299,000, which suggests ''the market is on its way back up,'' Mr. Miller said. And assuming buyers can get loans, they can afford ''a house where your family can have a backyard, near nice parks, shopping and public transportation,'' he added.
THE SCHOOLS
Public School 52 teaches 560 students through fifth grade. On state exams this year, 42 percent of third-graders met standards in math, 52 percent in English, versus 49 and 49 citywide.
About 870 students attend the Catherine and Count Basie Middle School for Grades 6 through 8. But Springfield Gardens High School graduated its last class in 2008, after problematic years with knife fights and shootings; it is now home to four smaller, specialized schools. The more traditional August Martin High School, where crime has also been an issue, enrolls 1,000 students. SAT averages there in the last academic year were 371 in math, 377 in reading and 360 in writing, versus 461, 434 and 430 statewide.
WHAT TO DO
Attractive parks, Baisley Pond and Springfield, bookend the neighborhood, though Hurricane Sandy downed many of their old oaks.
Restaurants offering Indian-style roti, the flatbread popular in the Caribbean, turn up on Guy Brewer Boulevard, which was named for a broker who encouraged blacks to relocate from Harlem in the 1940s, according to historical accounts.
And Rochdale has two public shopping malls.
THE COMMUTE
Springfield Gardens is served by the Locust Manor stop on the Long Island Rail Road. Six trains are available on weekdays between 7 and 9 a.m., though Sandy has temporarily put a stop to the 7:46. The trip to Pennsylvania Station takes 26 to 32 minutes. Monthly fares are $193.
Bus service includes the x63, which runs express to Manhattan. Passengers who board at Baisley and Merrick Boulevards arrive at East 57th Street about an hour later.
THE HISTORY
Ponds in the area once supplied Brooklyn with drinking water, funneled through pipes along Conduit Avenue. Rochdale went up on the site of the former Jamaica Race Course, a popular mile-long track that opened in 1903 and ran its last horse race in 1959.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Is Classical Music Dying?

 BODY:
Readers react to a violinist's fear that its audience is declining.
To the Editor:
A schoolboy recently asked me if Richard Wagner was a pitcher for the Yankees. At that moment I feared that classical music in America was doomed.
Or is it? The dying of the classical recording industry, which began in the 1990s, is indeed a cause for despair. There seem to be, sadly, other harbingers of the death of classical music in America:
¶The recent labor disputes of American orchestras due to decreased budgets and donor support.
¶The reduction or outright cancellation of Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic tours and concerts in the parks. 
¶The demise of classical music radio stations across America.
¶The increased media focus on rock and pop superstars, while classical music managements have difficulty booking concerts for their artists.
Nonetheless, there is a glimmer of hope that classical music can be saved. The New York Philharmonic has just announced a partnership with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. The Metropolitan Opera introduced live telecasts of its performances nationwide. New venues are springing up to accommodate the excellent classical ensembles and soloists emerging from music conservatories. Symphony orchestras have at least temporarily settled their labor disputes.
The future of classical music lies with the younger generation, which must be weaned away from the cacophony of rock and the neon glitter of ''American Idol''-type TV shows. Instead of dragging children to concerts, where they squirm with boredom, rent some old movies featuring soundtracks of classical music.
Even toddlers can be exposed to classical music through animated films like ''Fantasia'' and ''Peter and the Wolf.'' Elementary schoolchildren would love ''What's Opera, Doc?'' (1957), with its thrilling Wagnerian soundtrack as Elmer Fudd chases Bugs Bunny. Tell them the great music is by Richard Wagner. At least this audience will not think that he pitched for the Yankees.
LES DREYER New York, Nov. 16, 2012
The writer is a retired violinist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.
Readers React
Les Dreyer accurately describes the steady decline of classical music, and his points are well taken. That said, when he calls for parents to pull their children away from the cacophony of rock, he is making a generational error, for it's not today's children who have been missed by classical music, but their parents who grew up on rock and roll.
The failure to bring younger audiences to classical music happened more than 30 years ago. Now, while classic rock remains a vibrant radio format, and artists like the Rolling Stones, Billy Joel, The Who and Elton John continue to be popular, middle-agers who never migrated to classical music are content with the songs they grew up on. Too many of those listeners were never introduced to the power of Beethoven, the elegance of Mozart or the soulfulness of Mahler, and if they were, it was the aural equivalent of ''eating your vegetables.''
But it's not too late. What is needed is a well-funded national plan -- probably via philanthropy -- to market this great music. It needs to be packaged as an experience, not an education; passion needs to be reintroduced. Then we need to re-brand classical radio. That doesn't mean dumbing down; it means taking what is great and putting it in a package the target market recognizes.
So it's not hopeless, but arresting decline is not easy. What is in our favor, however, is that the product, the music, is incredible and can transcend generations.

As a lifelong player and lover of music, I have to sadly shake my head and say, Mr. Dreyer, you don't get it. Classical music is dying because it is and long has been an expensive, mannered and stuffy enterprise as far as the public is concerned.
For the past 40 years, rock has taught us that emoting and participating with our bodies and voices are part of the show. You can't do that in a concert hall. The entire society dresses informally now; concerts still involve formal wear by the audience, as if back in the 1890s.
Popular music has been growing exponentially in terms of newly created music; classical orchestras are just ''cover bands'' playing the same old tunes. Pop music has happily commingled every genre under the sun; classical remains, well, classical.
I recall the thrill of hearing Beethoven's Fifth when I was a child 50 years ago. But has the business of classical music made any significant advances in its appeal to the public since then, or kept up with societal changes and consumer tastes? Not that I can see. It should not surprise us, then, that this genre is on the ropes financially.
GRANT WIGGINS Hopewell, N.J., Nov. 19, 2012
As someone who grew up thinking I was the only one my age who listened to classical music, I am as concerned as you are. But you say we need to be ''weaned away from the cacophony of rock.'' This is where you lose me.
That argument is, frankly, condescending and counterproductive. Nothing about classical music is intrinsically superior to any other kind of music. You will find as much artistry in certain parts of the rock world as you will in classical music, albeit of a very different kind. Young people need to come to classical music on their own terms, and telling them they should abandon another kind of music that they love is not the way to accomplish this.
Also, think of how many great classical pieces were condemned as cacophonous when they were premiered: Beethoven's ''Grosse Fuge,'' for example, or Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.''
I appreciate your concern for the future of classical music, but please, please, never pit classical music against rock, because the latter will almost always win, and it isn't a choice anyone should ever have to make anyway.
CHARLIE VOLOW Williamstown, Mass., Nov. 19, 2012
It is not children who should be wooed to the classical canon, but young and early middle-aged adults. Although I was lucky enough to attend Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts as a child, it wasn't until my late 20s that I realized, as a sometime rock musician and composer, that the New York Philharmonic was as thrilling in concert as The Who or Eric Clapton.
Once one comprehends the high level of precision that goes into classical performance, the multitude of varying melodies presented by each piece and the emotional ride that a symphony orchestra can provide, there is no going back. In addition, pop music often doesn't wear well with the years, and its audience is pining for new adventures in music.
BERNARD LANGS New Providence, N.J., Nov. 19, 2012
Exposure to classical music (and sneaking it in through movies and cartoons) is fine, but what is really likely to make a difference is experience playing classical music. Until recently this was possible only for children whose parents had the means to buy instruments and pay for private lessons.
But El Sistema, an intensive orchestral program begun in Venezuela, is now spreading throughout the United States and other countries, in schools and in after-school programs. All children in an El Sistema program play an instrument in an orchestra, and they start young.
Performing powerful compositions puts music not just in the ears of children, but in their fingers, heads and hearts.
ELLEN WINNER Chestnut Hill, Mass., Nov. 19, 2012
The writer directs the Arts and Mind Lab at Boston College, where she is a professor of psychology of art.
Yes, classical music is dying in America, of a wasting illness that goes back to way before the 1990s.
Technology has been replacing live musicians since the '60s, first in live radio and TV, then in Broadway orchestra pits, now even in recording studios, leaving the symphony orchestra as the most labor-intensive, and therefore most expensive, enterprise in music. Given the economics, the only solution is the one most other civilized countries adopted long ago -- government support for the arts.
But the more serious, more obstinate problem is in the education of our children. In the 1950s, between the ages of 7 and 12, I spent every Saturday morning at the Cleveland Music School Settlement, learning music theory and history, to read and write musical notation, to recognize instruments by ear. I learned to play the clarinet and sang in the choir, and I did so with other working-class kids of all colors, at a price working-class families could afford.
How many of our grade-school children can read music today? Or recognize the difference between Bach and Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven, Verdi and Wagner?
We have responded to our multigenerational failure to educate by cutting the budgets for music, art, foreign language, even physical education, and diverting all our resources to ''core'' subjects. But even if we succeed in teaching our kids reading, writing and arithmetic, we will have failed to teach them their place in their own cultural history. We will have failed, in short, to civilize them.
DAVID BERMAN New York, Nov. 19, 2012
Classical music is not dead; it's not even resting. The classical world is evolving. Live listening experiences are incorporating new elements like video feeds, audience chats, short lunchtime or dinnertime programs and late-night cocktail concerts. The old major record labels have been largely replaced by new majors (Naxos and Harmonia Mundi chief among them) and a constellation of specialty labels.
Yes, radio stations are abandoning classical formats, but the sounds still echo on streaming sites like Spotify and YouTube, and online shops like iTunes. Last year, I watched the Glyndebourne Opera's ''Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg'' live through a feed on my laptop screen.
Does my own perspective influence my optimism? Undoubtedly. I am 23 and felt no qualms watching Gerald Finley sing Wagner while I was clad in my pajamas. My generation is shaping the musical world in the same way that Mr. Dreyer's influenced his.
Many things will change, but some will not. Artists are as plentiful and talented as ever before. Audiences are engaged by new twists on concertgoing traditions. And nothing can ever diminish the power of the music.
BRIAN REINHART Dallas, Nov. 19, 2012
The writer is a critic for MusicWeb International.
While some of the litany of concern for the future of classical music rings true, focusing entirely on the negative ignores overwhelming evidence of the resiliency of symphonic music in America and throughout the world.
There are far more orchestras working in harmony than struggling through contractual disputes. For every orchestra that has faced a difficulty, there are orchestras that have been setting fund-raising and attendance records since the recession.
Unfortunately, the positive stories do not receive the sensationalistic coverage of the negative stories. And that is, to some degree, a fault of the classical music field itself. Success is not as easy to headline as failure.
The next generation of music lovers will have greater access to music of all types than those who have come before. Mahler is as available to them now through iTunes (and other sources) as Lady Gaga. Great music of all styles does not have to be in competition. The more you love any music, the more open you become to loving all music.
Orchestras remain strong economic engines for their communities, vital educational organizations for the next generation and monuments to the elevation of the human spirit. Orchestras will remain so if we stop emphasizing the negative litany and reach out in more authentic ways to our audiences, both present and future.
BRUCE RIDGE Chairman, International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians Raleigh, N.C., Nov. 19, 2012
I can pinpoint the exact moment when I stopped attending live classical performances. While on a university trip, I noticed that the Boston Symphony Orchestra was playing, and with Seiji Ozawa conducting I had to attend.
Being dressed in khakis and a polo shirt, I was underdressed compared with the rest of the crowd. No big deal until a woman asked me if I thought I should dress better for the occasion. ''Not unless my clothes affect my hearing'' was my reply.
Here in Buffalo, where there is an excellent symphony, I have detected the same kind of condescension and class snobbery. So it's the radio and iTunes for me.
KEVIN STEVENS Buffalo, Nov. 19, 2012
I disagree with Mr. Dreyer about the value of dragging kids to concert halls. Live music, especially orchestral and chamber performances, may be the best way to introduce anyone to the wonder of what composers and musicians and instruments can create.
However, if someone is used to frenetic pop music with lyrics and videos, don't bludgeon them with Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Instead, let them see and hear performances of some of the great modern short pieces, which can be frenetic or languid, but never boring. Expose every seventh grader and a parent to John Adams, Toru Takemitsu and Christopher Cerrone, to name just three of the many, many contemporary composers whose work would never be lumped with the dreaded ''classical music,'' and we might be on our way to a new generation of listeners.
CHARLIE HATHAWAY Tenafly, N.J., Nov. 19, 2012
I am a classical music lover -- in my 60s, of course. As much as I admire Mr. Dreyer's optimism, I think classical music lovers are a dying demographic.
Some of the reasons are familiar: Music appreciation isn't taught in schools. Also, the sadly diminished resources going into performing arts are going mostly into ''Glee''-type vocal music and various schools of rock, not groups that aspire to the classical canon.
Demographics are changing rapidly. Classical music is rooted in Europe, whereas today's children look at least as much toward Latin America, Asia and Africa for their cultural roots. Performing arts groups overwhelmingly program works by dead men, not living men or living women.
Even efforts to expand audiences aren't working well. From what I hear, the Metropolitan Opera simulcasts are attended by an overwhelmingly white-haired audience.
Maybe this can be turned around, largely by more intense involvement by classical musicians in schools as well as performances that don't look or feel like conventional concerts. Alas, it's an awfully heavy lift.
RICHARD LAMPERT Philadelphia, Nov. 19, 2012
I disagree that young people need to be ''weaned away from the cacophony of rock and the neon glitter of 'American Idol'-type TV shows.'' Those forms of popular entertainment thrive because there is a mass market for them. Classical music can exist alongside and in spite of these entertainments, but it must present itself as equally relevant to potential listeners.
Reaching that audience is daunting. Performers' costumes remain the same as those mocked in the cartoons of a half century ago that Mr. Dreyer cites. Rather than relying on unimaginative formulas, concert programming must stimulate feedback, debate and speculation. Accessibility to classical music should be improved through performances outside the concert hall (clubs, galleries, and so on). Concert times should be similarly handled. Not everyone is available for a concert at 8 p.m.; why not earlier or later?
Young people can be encouraged to attend through grants that underwrite the cost of their tickets, something the Cleveland Orchestra does. Musicians must be visible in the public school system (as teachers and mentors), for if they ignore the larger culture they live in, they risk marginalization. If all a child has access to are Pink, Snoop Dogg or Taylor Swift, then Bach, Brahms and Birtwistle are unlikely in their future.
There is a difference between culture and entertainment. Entertainment is market-driven, its technical resources attuned to the whims of current mass culture. Classical music maintains the cultural legacy of the past along with the often difficult works of the present. It is up to performers and managements to convincingly give these compositions a place in greater society.
Mr. Dreyer's questioner wasn't that far off, however. There was a pitcher named Richard Wagner. He never made it to the Yankees.
CLOVIS LARK Principal Librarian Utah Symphony Orchestra Salt Lake City, Nov. 19, 2012
The Writer Responds
Mr. Rudel, your letter humbles me. And I agree with you 100 percent. Yet my ''generational error'' is understandable: I grew up in a Russian Jewish neighborhood where every kid was a budding Heifetz, Piatigorsky or Rubinstein. That said, I applaud your idea of repackaging classical music in a format recognizable by the target market, and reintroducing it as a passionate experience instead of a forced education. Whether the funding for this project is philanthropic or federal or whatever is irrelevant. The point is that you are optimistic, as I am, about saving classical music in America, and the rock-infected parents must give their children at least a chance to form their own musical taste.
Mr. Langs, as a rock musician and composer, you confess discovering in your late 20s that the New York Philharmonic was as thrilling as The Who or Eric Clapton. Congratulations! It is never too late to cross over (which seems to be the trend in opera lately), and we classical music lovers welcome you aboard. Moreover, your realization that ''pop music often doesn't wear well with the years'' is what differentiates it from classical music, which is eternal.
Mr. Wiggins, you regret that you can't rock and roll at a classical music concert. What on earth does emoting with our bodies and voices have to do with classical music? Would you let out a yell of joy during a Mozart opera, or a moan of despair during ''Parsifal''? And who nowadays wears formal wear to symphony concerts or solo recitals?
Moreover, I am mortified that you refer to symphony orchestras as ''just 'cover bands' playing the same old tunes.'' That's like calling the Mona Lisa merely a grinning dame.
This is Beethoven Awareness Month. Please sit quietly while listening to him.

HEADLINE: Selling a 'Hot Spot' to the Beau Monde

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
TUCKED away in central Switzerland, Andermatt was for decades a low-key Alpine town popular with skiers searching for an off-piste experience. Its brief claim to movie fame was as the setting for a car chase in the James Bond film ''Goldfinger.''
Any aspirations the town may have had were dampened for decades by the fact that Andermatt was home to a Swiss army base, and because of rules limiting foreign ownership of Swiss property, which kept tourism to a three-star experience.
But now a billionaire Egyptian developer, Samih Sawiris, is building a luxury resort town-within-a-town at Andermatt, with 800 residences spread across five-star hotels, apartments and custom villas that could sell for up to 60 million Swiss francs (about $64 million) apiece.
The ambitious project is the first in Switzerland where foreigners can buy property without restrictions, after the government granted an unusual exemption to promote economic development. And Andermatt, which is two hours by car from Milan and 90 minutes from Zurich, has the potential to be one of the next ''it'' destinations for the world's wealthiest. 
Mr. Sawiris, the chief executive of Orascom Development, envisions a sort of highbrow global village. ''His desire is that when an owner goes into the village they are surrounded by and engaging with well-traveled, well-educated, like-minded individuals from around the world,'' said Tony Young, head of sales with Henley Estates International, which is selling Andermatt in North America, ''so they have a true cultural experience in the middle of the Swiss Alps.
''He would prefer it not to be a European resort, an American resort, or a Russian experience,'' Mr. Young added. ''He wants it to be a true international experience.''
But who exactly will end up buying in Andermatt is on the minds of the marketers, as well as a few prospective buyers.
The developers might prefer a global mix of people to help feed Mr. Sawiris's utopian dream of a sophisticated Alpine enclave, and to protect the project from the uncertainties of the international financial markets or the whims of the ultrawealthy.
Yet it could become the next Courchevel, the French Alpine village that has become the top luxury ski resort catering to wealthy Russians in recent years.
From a strictly financial perspective, the developers should only be so lucky. Courchevel is one of the most expensive places in the world. Property prices in one village, Courchevel 1850, have averaged about $3,216 per square foot.
Russians descend on Courchevel during the first two weeks of January for the Russian Orthodox Christmas and New Year. The flight from Moscow takes less than two and a half hours. Courchevel is also part of the travel circuit for Russian billionaires after they fly to St. Bart's in the Caribbean to attend a New Year's party hosted by Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of the Chelsea soccer club. At least three of Russia's richest men -- including Mr. Abramovich, Vladimir Potanin and Mikhail Prokhorov -- have reportedly vacationed in Courchevel.
That's not to say that it doesn't attract other V.I.P.'s. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, the Saudi royal family, George Clooney and David and Victoria Beckham have also reportedly visited.
The Russians' free-spending ways have created competition to provide the best of everything -- including fine dining, nightclubs offering Beluga caviar, diamond-and-gold encrusted skis selling for more than $45,000 a pair -- transforming Courchevel into perhaps the world's most opulent place to ski. Many club owners from St. Tropez and Cannes move there in the winter to run restaurants and clubs, said Edward Mermelstein, a real estate lawyer in New York who caters to wealthy Russians.
Their lavish spending has at times drawn the attention of authorities. In 2007 the French police arrested Mr. Prokhorov, the owner of the New Jersey Nets and an eligible bachelor, on suspicion of hiring prostitutes for his guests. He was released three days later. He denied the women were prostitutes; the case was dropped and he said in a blog post in 2009 that he had received an apology.
Orascom would rather that Andermatt not become the next Alpine village to generate such headlines.
''We are not looking for a competition,'' said Christof Birkhofer, Orascom's head of real estate for the Andermatt project. ''We want to be different, and not just a place for rich people.''
Mr. Birkhofer scoffed at what he considers the ostentatious sensibility of Courchevel. ''They try to sell standard skis branded by Prada for $10,000,'' he said. In Switzerland, ''we would sell skis based on the quality, not the brand, skis that would be handmade, tailored to your body shape. That's why you would pay $10,000.''
Andermatt's developers are betting that people from all over the world will jump at a rare chance to own a piece of a Swiss resort area.
Swiss rules have long put foreigners through a lengthy application process to buy property, and restricted them to one piece of property per application. But in the 1990s the government decided to make defense cuts and pulled the army out of Andermatt. With the region concerned about economic development, the government approved a one-time exemption for Orascom's project.
The developer plans to spend about $1.92 billion at Andermatt. The project includes five hotels, all of which will be five-star quality and offer residences for sale. The developer also plans to build 42 apartment buildings with a total of 490 residences. And as many as 28 residential villas will be offered along the river and golf course, on plots ranging from under a quarter acre to just over an acre.
Buyers will be able to work with 18 approved architects to customize villas and penthouses.
The first of five hotels, the Chedi, is to open late next year. It will have a 4,500-square-foot penthouse that will rent for $43,000 a night. The overall project will not be completed for another six to eight years.
Prices start at $1 million, for a studio or one-bedroom of about 732 square feet. A private villa built on the largest piece of land will cost about $64 million, Mr. Young said.
And despite all the development, the aura of the tiny mountain town will be protected for future residents. Cars and trucks will be confined to an underground parking structure for 1,900 vehicles, with deliveries to hotels all being made underground.
Orascom also plans to spend $138 million to upgrade the ski runs to world-class standards.
Sales have been steady. In September a German hedge fund bought 73 apartments in the Chedi for about $130 million. So far Andermatt has sold properties totaling more than $500 million, Mr. Young said. Some 60 percent of the buyers have been Swiss, the rest foreigners, Mr. Birkhofer said.
Among the early foreign buyers are a few Russians. Limiting their purchases ''gets tricky,'' Mr. Young said. ''Legally you can't say there is a limit, and we aren't going to do that.'' But the developer probably has the ability to control the number of properties available at any one time.
Beyond curbing the predomination of residents from any one country, Mr. Sawaris also wants to find a celebrity endorser for Andermatt. Mr. Young and his wife, Barbara, the president of Henley Estates International, are working contacts in Hollywood to find the equivalent of George Clooney, who helped raise Lake Como's international profile when he bought a villa there.
''For the right A-list celebrity, they might even give them an apartment,'' or a week's stay a year in the Chedi penthouse, Mr. Young said. ''The developer wants a really strong American presence in this resort.''

HEADLINE: His History

BYLINE: By ANDREW GOLDMAN

 BODY:
''Come on, that's such a canard, you know that,'' Oliver Stone said. '' 'The Greatest Generation?' That was the biggest publishing hoax of all. It's to sell books.'' This seemingly sacrosanct term was coined by Tom Brokaw for his 1998 book of the same title, in which he recounted the lives of ordinary, World War II-era Americans. ''I was in Vietnam with the Greatest Generation. They were master sergeants, generals, colonels. They had arrogance beyond belief. The hubris that allowed Henry Kissinger to say North Vietnam is a fourth-rate power we will break. The hubris of that!'' 
We were discussing Stone's latest project, a 10-part Showtime series and a 750-page companion volume called ''The Untold History of the United States,'' which begins with World War I and ends with the first Obama administration. It's an Oliver Stone version of a History Channel documentary, one guaranteed to raise the ires of both left and right and where all roads lead to Vietnam. From where Stone sits, World War II begot the cold war, which landed us in Vietnam, a manifestation of American imperialism, which led inexorably to our current battle in Afghanistan. We have, Stone says, been sold a fairy tale masquerading as history, and it is so blinding it may ultimately undo us. ''You have to understand what it was like to be a Roman empire and to find some barbarian tribe riding into Rome in 476 A.D.,'' Stone said. ''It's quite a shock. And that's what will happen to us unless we change our attitude about what our role in the world is. Every story out of most newspapers is 'the Americans think this, the administration thinks this.' It's always about our controlling the pieces on the chessboard. I think what the Arabs have shown us is that we don't control the chess pieces. And this is a shock to many people. But it's definitely in 'The Greatest Generation.' And it's in Spielberg's World War II film, and it's in Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down.' These are wonderful-looking films, but the message is perverted.''
It was a late September morning, and Stone was sitting on the terrace of his hotel suite in San Sebastián, Spain, where his latest film, ''Savages,'' was being screened as part of the city's 60-year-old film festival. The sun was peeking through some late-morning clouds, glinting off the river below, and Stone shielded his eyes with a pair of sunglasses that could have been part of Kevin Costner's wardrobe in ''JFK.'' At a news conference he gave the day before, he suggested that the former Spanish president José María Aznar should be tried at The Hague on war-crimes charges for his participation in Bush's Coalition of the Willing during the Iraq War. The remark presumably only enhanced his status in San Sebastián, where he was presented with the Donostia, the festival's lifetime achievement award. Before the premiere of ''Savages,'' Stone walked the red carpet with John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro, waiting, a bit impatiently, as Travolta, Bill Clinton-like, shook the hand of every fan reaching out to him from behind the barriers, kissed old ladies and posed for innumerable cellphone pictures; Stone shook some hands, too, but demurred when asked to kiss a small dog. ''Allergies,'' he explained, pointing to his nose.
''Savages,'' based on a popular 2010 novel by Don Winslow about a couple of boutique marijuana growers who are drawn into battle with a brutal Mexican drug cartel, covers terrain that is near to Stone's heart. To promote the film, he appeared on the cover of High Times, puffing on a thick joint. I mentioned to Stone that the reporter who interviewed him for Playboy in 1987 later wrote that the drunkest he'd ever gotten was with Stone, in Southampton, where Stone was filming the beach house scene in ''Wall Street.'' The reporter remembers several bottles of bourbon, and then little else until he woke the next morning, soaking wet. He'd passed out on the hotel lawn and was roused when the sprinklers started up. Stone chuckled. ''That is funny,'' he said. ''Because we've all had moments on lawns where we passed out. One time I was in the Bel-Air Hotel. I woke up in the bushes, and I couldn't find my way back. And my new wife was waiting. It was kind of a honeymoon. I remember stumbling in and her face when she saw me.'' Was the look on her face one of horror? I asked. ''Well, it was like she was in for something with the marriage here,'' he said. This was his first wife, Najwa Sarkis, he clarified (he has been married to Sun-jung Jung, his third wife, since 1996).
But Stone isn't a kid anymore. He's 66, sometimes wears hearing aids and can't shake off hangovers the way he used to. (''Two vodkas or two tequilas and a few glasses of wine, that's the edge for me,'' he said.) It has been more than 25 years since his greatest critical and commercial success, ''Platoon,'' an autobiographical retelling of his Vietnam experience, which won best director and best picture and harvested almost $150 million at the domestic box office. And now he's at the age where he's considering his legacy. ''A lot of people when they get older they write autobiographies or memoirs,'' he said. ''But my priority would be to ask, What did the times I lived through mean? And did I understand them?''
Stone modeled his new series on the landmark 1973-74 ITV series ''The World at War,'' which, at 26 episodes, is considered as exhaustive and authoritative a study of World War II as could be offered on television. Stone's ''Untold History'' jams almost 75 years of American history into just 10 hours, so that may kill the exhaustive angle, but Stone is certainly hoping for the authoritative bit. ''This,'' he pronounced, ''is truly the meaning of these events.''
Spend any time with Stone, and you'll soon discover that he lacks what you might call the deliberation gene, whatever prevents us from saying things that will get us in trouble, lose us friendships, even jobs. Years ago, a producer on ''Nixon'' related that when he first introduced Stone to his mother, Stone declared, ''You look Chinese.'' (She was not.) At dinner, I watched Stone jokingly tell two female Spanish film executives that he missed the days when attractive Spanish women, with little economic opportunity at home, served as maids in wealthy French households. The day we met, I mentioned that my family would be leaving Brooklyn for Connecticut, where we don't know a soul. ''But, really, what's the worst thing that could happen?'' I said, offering the kind of throwaway phrase used to move from one topic to the next. Well, Stone postulated, quite earnestly, you could end up going through an acrimonious divorce and then be forced to wage an expensive battle over custody of your children.
Stone often comes to understand, too late, the consequences of his words. In Spain, he talked openly about the furor that ensued when, in 2010, a British journalist asked him why people were so fixated on memorializing the Holocaust, considering, as he told her, that ''Hitler did far more damage to the Russians'' than he did to the Jews and that the Russians lost ''25, 30 million'' in the war. It was, Stone claimed, because of what he called ''the Jewish domination of the media'' and Israel's ''powerful lobby in Washington.'' As TheWrap.com reported, this did not go over well with some in Hollywood, notably with the entertainment magnate Haim Saban, a prominent supporter of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, who personally lobbied the president of CBS, Leslie Moonves, to kill the series on Showtime (owned by CBS). Soon after, Stone apologized to the Anti-Defamation League, retracting his claim that Israel and the pro-Israel lobby were to blame for America's ''flawed foreign policy.'' ''Of course that's not true, and I apologize that my inappropriately glib remark has played into that negative stereotype,'' his statement read. In Spain, I asked if he stood by this abject apology. ''I don't know about the word 'abject,' '' he said. ''I did use the wrong word, and I had to apologize because I should not have used the word 'Jewish.' That was the only thing that's frankly wrong in that statement. I was upset at the time about Israel and their control, their seeming control over American foreign policy. It's clear that Jews do not dominate the media. Rupert Murdoch, Clear Channel, Christians dominate much of the right wing. But certainly Aipac has an undue influence. They were very much militating for the war in Iraq. They got it.''
A few days after returning from Europe, Stone sent me a long e-mail, clarifying a few of the more inflammatory things he'd said. He also requested that I not call CBS to inquire about the seeming retraction of his retraction, concerned that Showtime might flinch and pull his as-yet unbroadcast ''Untold History'' series. ''Feel free to write about it, but why go now and wave a red flag in front of bulls?'' he wrote. It had happened before. In 2003, HBO was set to broadcast his first Fidel Castro documentary, ''Comandante,'' in which Stone showed the Cuban leader speed-walking around his office, mooning over Brigitte Bardot and basking in the love of ebullient Cubans. When Castro executed three hijackers of a ferry to the United States and imprisoned more than 70 political dissidents, HBO pulled the program two weeks before airtime. ''I was heartbroken,'' Stone said.
Considering his occasional disregard of others' feelings, Stone is surprisingly sensitive about his work. ''He's always experienced self-doubt because he's so often trying to break the rules,'' says Edward R. Pressman, who produced four of Stone's movies, including ''Wall Street.'' In Spain, Stone mentioned ''Heaven and Earth'' (1993), his third film about Vietnam, which, I admitted, I hadn't seen. ''No one has seen it,'' he lamented. ''It was my biggest financial failure. But I don't regret it. It was an amazingly beautiful movie, and I hope you see it one day.'' Sure I would, I told him. ''Will you?'' he said.
When I returned home, I received a package from Stone's Ixtlan production company that, in addition to ''Heaven and Earth,'' included his three Castro documentaries, as well as a 3-hour-34-minute version of his epic ''Alexander.'' He can't stand the 2-hour-55-minute theatrical edit he made for Warner Brothers. ''It was really a two-part roadshow movie,'' he said. ''If I had had the confidence I would have made it that.''
A few weeks later, he looked genuinely pained when I needled him about the Connecticut divorce comment he made in Spain. When he met my wife, he took her hands in his and told her, apologetically, ''I love Connecticut.''
Last month, on the afternoon before the premiere of three episodes of ''Untold History'' at the New York Film Festival, Stone and Peter Kuznick were bickering in a conference room at Stone's publicity firm. Kuznick is the history professor at the American University in Washington who helped write the Showtime series and, even Stone admits, most of the book. At 64, Kuznick is Stone's contemporary, and the two men in their identical outfits of black jackets and pressed blue oxford shirts might suggest some sort of cosmic parity if their personal backgrounds weren't so dissimilar. Whereas Kuznick was raised by left-leaning, politically active Jews and joined the N.A.A.C.P. at age 12, Stone's political evolution has been a gradual but radical departure from his upbringing in the Upper East Side household of Louis Stone, a stockbroker and Eisenhower Republican, who instilled in his son an almost-paralyzing fear of Russia's global military and economic ascendancy. ''I remember crying, practically, and saying why aren't we doing anything?'' Stone said. He infuriated his father by dropping out of Yale after his first year (George W. Bush was in his freshman class) and later joined the Army and served in the infantry in Vietnam. Not long before enlisting, he tried, unsuccessfully, to sell a novel, an event he has said left him in a suicidal mood. He wanted to make his military experience as difficult as possible. ''I insisted on the infantry, and I insisted on Vietnam because I didn't want to end up going to Germany,'' he said. ''And I got that, which was good for me, because it woke me up.''
In a very small way, the challenges of objectively documenting history are made manifest when you ask Stone and Kuznick how they came to work together on ''Untold History.'' Kuznick was a huge Oliver Stone fan, so much so that in 1996, he started teaching a course called Oliver Stone's America, which attracted, in its very first year, a visit from the only guy he considered an indispensable guest lecturer. Over dinner that evening, Kuznick regaled him with his take on Henry Wallace, vice president during F.D.R.'s third term, whom Kuznick considers a brilliant progressive and an unsung hero. During the 1944 Democratic convention, thanks to some conservative power players, Wallace, instead of being renominated for vice president, was at the last moment tossed aside for Harry Truman, a senator of limited experience who was only briefed that the United States was building the atomic bomb after Roosevelt died. If Wallace rather than Truman had become president, Kuznick told Stone, the United States might not have dropped atomic bombs on Japan, and the cold war might never have started.
Stone commissioned Kuznick to write a treatment. Kuznick, convinced that he'd been ushered into the movie business, got himself a William Morris agent, who lobbied for Kuznick to write the script. But the screenplay suffered the same fate as several of Stone's pet projects -- the C.I.A.-hunting-Bin-Laden project, the Manuel Noriega project, the My Lai project. That is, it died. And this is where Kuznick and Stone's versions of history diverge.
Stone: ''It was a great idea. I'd never heard the story, and I wanted to do a '40s kind of movie. It was perfect. And he [expletive] up the screenplay.''
Kuznick: ''Don't believe that, because Oliver told a mutual friend of ours who told me, 'Oliver said it's a work of genius, I'm dying to make it.' ''
Stone: ''Nooo!''
Kuznick: ''Well, you did. You forgot.''
A decade later, Stone told Kuznick he wanted his help on a 90-minute documentary about Wallace, Truman and the birth of the atom bomb. Soon after, the 90-minute documentary morphed, Kuznick was never sure how, into a 10-hour Showtime series that he was on the hook to write and research. Both men make the four years it took to put together the series sound about as much fun as the siege of Leningrad. Stone missed his deadline by two full years, and his foreign distributor almost ditched the project. It was one of the many bumps that didn't go unfelt by Kuznick. ''Oliver is always good about sharing the pressure,'' Kuznick told me. ''Whatever pressure Oliver is feeling, I would get a double dose of.'' As we talked, Kuznick's cellphone rang. It was Stone, who was about to be interviewed for the Carson Daly show and needed stats on how much the United States committed to pay the U.S.S.R. in reparations after World War II, and how much, per year, the United States spends in Afghanistan per Al Qaeda member who actually resides in Afghanistan.
Kuznick is not the first expert Stone has relied on in making his films. ''JFK'' was based on ''On the Trail of the Assassins,'' by Jim Garrison, a former Orleans Parish district attorney who, in 1969, unsuccessfully prosecuted Clay Shaw, a New Orleans businessman, for conspiring to kill the president. Kevin Costner played Garrison as an Atticus Finch type fighting an ingrained power structure, though Garrison is dismissed by many mainstream historians as a con man. In researching ''JFK,'' Stone also relied on L. Fletcher Prouty, a former Air Force colonel who, before becoming disillusioned with government, was chief of special operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Kennedy administration. Prouty never actually met Garrison except in Stone's film, where he is Donald Sutherland's Colonel X, who lays it all out for the D.A. in the shadow of the Washington Monument -- how the military deliberately underprotected the president in Dallas, how defense contractors, big oil and bankers conspired with the military to make sure the president died because he didn't intend to go to war in Vietnam. Costner is a kind of stand-in for Stone, soberly shaking his head as X says: ''Does that sound like a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr. Garrison? Not for one moment.''
In advance of the film's release, Stone pronounced ''JFK'' ''a history lesson.'' Prouty, however, who died in 2001, turned out to be extremely problematic. He had many theories in addition to his theories on Kennedy, including that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had foreknowledge of the Jonestown Massacre and that greedy oil barons invented the fiction that oil is made of decomposed fossils. And it was Prouty, Stone said, who turned him on to ''The Report From Iron Mountain,'' a 1967 document ostensibly written by a secret panel of military planners. The document is a favorite among conspiracy theorists, who, like Prouty, seem unaware that in 1972 the satirist Leonard Lewin admitted he wrote it. ''I've acknowledged when I've made mistakes,'' Stone said of the movie now. ''There were a few mistakes, but nothing that changes the big story.''
It has been more than 20 years since Stone made ''JFK,'' a film that he now says should be looked at not as history but as a dramatized version of it -- ''the spirit of the truth.'' ''It's called dramatic license,'' Stone said about his approach in ''JFK.'' ''It's a noble tradition. The Greeks did it, Homer did it, Shakespeare did it.'' Increased historical rigor may explain why his portrayal of Nixon's life was deemed judicious by comparison, and even why, to the great chagrin of his liberal fans, ''W.'' was judged a sympathetic portrayal of Bush. (''It's empathy,'' he said, clearly irritated by that take. ''It's not sympathy. I repeat, I did not like George Bush, nor did I like Richard Nixon.'') This time, perhaps, having a bona fide tenured professor on his side will silence his many critics.
The screening of ''Untold History'' during the New York Film Festival early last month suggested that he might have a hit. At the end of the third hour, the crowd roared its approval. The cheers got only louder when Stone sauntered onstage for a postscreening panel discussion. ''So much of what I saw today is what we try to do at The Nation,'' said Katrina vanden Heuvel, the publisher and editor of the left's beloved 147-year-old weekly. ''To challenge the orthodoxy, challenge the conformity of our history and to speak truth to power.'' Jonathan Schell, a journalist who also writes for The Nation, concurred.
Stone didn't seem particularly riveted by the conversation at first, leaning back in his chair, gripping the bridge of his nose as if he had a sinus headache and sometimes closing his eyes so that, owing to his bushy Brezhnev eyebrows, he looked like a Russian premier lying in state. Just when the panel started to feel like a wonky meeting of Park Slope Food Coop members, the historian Douglas Brinkley stirred things up. Even though Brinkley provided the authors a nice blurb, calling the book ''a brave revisionist study which shatters many foreign policy myths,'' he had a few bones to pick with the project. Brinkley, who has written several notable histories, said he thought the series had gone too far in demonizing Truman. ''Truman is one of the most popular presidents in American history, and he's popular for doing a bunch of things,'' he said. Brinkley mentioned how Truman presided over the end of World War II, racially integrated American troops, helped create the state of Israel and airlifted supplies into Soviet-blockaded West Berlin. ''The only opening you're giving him is that he was a naïf,'' Brinkley said. This perked Stone right up. He shook his head. ''If he'd done something noble, believe me, we're not looking to cut it out,'' Stone said, earning him a round of applause. ''I just don't see any nobleness.''
But Brinkley has a point. If the only thing you ever learned about Truman was from ''Untold History,'' you might conclude he was a virulent racist, mentally unfit for office and suffering from a gender confusion that led to mass murder. ''He was bullied by other boys who called him 'Four Eyes' and 'sissy' and chased him home after school,'' Stone narrates. ''When he arrived home, trembling, his mother would comfort him by telling him not to worry because he was meant to be a girl anyway.'' This, the series implies, might explain why Truman dropped atomic bombs on Japan -- not to end the war but to flex his muscles and intimidate Stalin, as he himself had been intimidated as a boy.
While Stone glancingly acknowledges Stalin's mass murder of his own people, Stalin, compared with Truman, still comes off as heroic, as an honest negotiator who, following F.D.R.'s death, was faced at every turn with Truman's diplomatic perfidy. (Stalin promised that after he defeated Germany, he'd invade Japan, but Truman dropped the bomb anyway.) Stone also sees America's role in the war as exaggerated. ''The Soviets were regularly battling more than 200 German divisions. . . . The Americans and the British fighting in the Mediterranean rarely confronted more than 10,'' Stone narrates.
If Truman represents the black hat of ''The Untold History,'' the white hats belong to those whose promise was unfulfilled -- F.D.R., who died before he could make peace in Europe and Asia humanely, and Kennedy, cut down before he could stem aggression toward Communist elements in Southeast Asia. (The cold war, the series posits, was mostly a product of American paranoia and imperialist ambitions. Stalin was essentially pulled onto the dance floor by the United States, and Russia's continued domination of Eastern Europe mainly a defensive response to our nuclear program and the establishment of American military bases throughout Europe.) The biggest hero of all, though, is the man who inspired the whole project: Henry Wallace. In the series, Wallace is treated to reverent orchestral music when his face appears on-screen, intercut at times with clips from ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' ''Wallace stuck out like a sore thumb on Capitol Hill,'' Stone narrates. ''He studied Buddhism and Zoroastrianism. . . . He liked to spend evenings reading or throwing boomerangs on the Potomac.''
Onstage, Kuznick said that he and Stone wanted to highlight pivotal moments in history when better decisions could have been made. ''We actually came very close to having a very different kind of history,'' he said. ''We want to give people the ability to think in a utopian fashion again.'' I asked Stone what would have happened had Wallace, not Truman, become president. ''There would not have been this cold war,'' he said. ''There would have been the continuation of the Roosevelt-Stalin working out of things. Vietnam wouldn't have happened.''
While to his fans Stone's alternate histories are provocative, his detractors see them as grossly irresponsible cherry-picking. The conservative historian and CUNY emeritus professor Ronald Radosh said he found himself wanting to do harm to his television while watching the first four episodes, which he reviewed for the right-wing Weekly Standard. Radosh had been blogging skeptically about the Stone project since its announcement in 2010, but now that he'd actually seen it, he said, it was the historian rather than the conservative in him who was most offended. ''Historians can have different interpretations, but based on evidence,'' he said. ''What these other guys do is manipulate evidence and ignore evidence that does not fit their predetermined thesis, and that's why they're wrong.'' According to Radosh, Stone and Kuznick's take on the United States' role in the cold war mirrors the argument in ''We Can Be Friends,'' a book published in 1952 by Carl Marzani, who was convicted of concealing his affiliation to the Communist Party when he joined the O.S.S., the precursor to the C.I.A. ''This Stone-Kuznick film could have been put out in 1955 as Soviet propaganda,'' Radosh said. ''They use all the old stuff.''
Radosh, who grew up as a Red Diaper baby in Washington Heights and only later turned to the right, thinks of himself as intimately familiar with the ''old stuff.'' But fearing he might be dismissed as partisan, he insisted I reach out to Sean Wilentz, a Princeton historian who, owing to his strident defense of Bill Clinton during his impeachment hearings and to his 2006 Rolling Stone cover article on George W. Bush, ''The Worst President in History?'' is regarded as decidedly left-leaning. When I spoke to him, Wilentz said: ''You can't get two historians more unlike each other than me and Ronnie Radosh. But we can agree about this. It's ridiculous.'' Wilentz was in the middle of writing a review of Stone's book. ''Always beware of books that describe themselves as the untold history of anything, because it's usually been told before,'' he said. ''It sets up this thing that there is some sort of mysterious force suppressing the true facts, right? Glenn Beck does this all the time. It's the same thing here, except this is basically a very standard left-wing, C.P., fellow traveler, Wallace-ite vision of what happened in 1945-46.'' It's not, Wilentz continued, that the questions raised aren't worth raising. ''Is there a legitimate argument to be made about the origins of our nuclear diplomacy or the decision to build the H-bomb?'' he said. ''Of course there is. But it's so overloaded with ideological distortion that this question doesn't get raised in an intelligent way. And once a question gets raised in an unintelligent way, then you are off in cloud-cuckoo land.''
But for some, Stone's work, though flawed, does succeed in reorienting our perspective. ''What Stone makes you rethink, which is very valuable, is why later in life did Truman have to take on such a macho posture?'' Brinkley said after the screening. ''I would think you'd be a little bit concerned about wiping out a civilian population and being the only president to use nuclear weapons.'' Brinkley was referring to a clip Stone included from a 1958 interview Truman did with Edward R. Murrow, in which he was asked if the bomb was really necessary. Truman answered, chillingly: ''We had this powerful new weapon. I had no qualms about using it.''
''Untold History'' wants to present itself as the whole truth and nothing but. Yet Stone has always fared best as a provocateur. ''JFK'' may not be particularly good history, but so many people believed his film to be a document of the actual conspiracy, and so many others dismissed it as hooey, that Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act in 1992, which precipitated the release of millions of pages of documents. We would never discover that L.B.J. had a hand in the killing -- as Colonel X's monologue in the movie would have us believe -- but we did find out that L.B.J. thought preposterous the Warren Commission's ''magic bullet'' explanation for how one bullet could have passed through the bodies of Kennedy and John Connally only to emerge pristine. And all the talk of forged autopsy records, which to many seemed like cloud-cuckoo land, didn't seem so crazy after documents revealed that the pathologist who performed the J.F.K. autopsy had burned his original notes and replaced them with an edited version. This is unimpeachably good history that is directly attributable to Oliver Stone's not being a great historian.
On Nov. 10, two days before the premiere of ''Untold History'' on Showtime, Kuznick was onstage at the 92nd Street Y, crowing a bit about the project's reception. (He hadn't yet heard the excoriating opinions of Wilentz and others.) ''It's interesting to see the early reviews,'' Kuznick said. ''They're all glowing, really. I mean, nobody's challenging anything we're saying, either our facts or our interpretations.'' Stone, sitting next to him, gestured with his hands, as if to calm him down. ''Well, it's early,'' Stone said.

HEADLINE: Stirring Up Stodgy Italy With His Political Style

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

 BODY:
VERBANIA, Italy -- Matteo Renzi, the 37-year-old mayor of Florence, has been traversing Italy in a white camper for two months, delivering rousing speeches with a bit of American-style campaigning, as he competes in a primary to decide who will lead Italy's center-left Democratic Party in national elections next year.
His campaign slogan, ''Adesso'' (Now), seems borrowed from the Obama handbook, his campaign colors are the same as the American flag, and he makes a point of addressing crowds in a jacketless, chummy manner, in vivid contrast to Italy's more declamatory tradition.
But it is not just Mr. Renzi's youthful campaign style that is stirring up his party -- and by extension, Italian politics. It is his message for ''rottamazione'' -- which translates as scrapping, and is most often used when consigning a car to the junk heap. 
That, Mr. Renzi proclaims, is what he would like to do to the political class that led Italy into its current economic morass, while rejuvenating his own party, which now has a strong chance to win power in national elections next spring, given the disarray that has troubled the conservative party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Mr. Renzi's message is meant especially for disaffected young people, and taps a widespread contempt for politicians, who are perceived more than ever as corrupt, overprivileged and out of touch with a struggling nation.
But his campaign has also strongly offended the traditions of many in the left, which he wants to move toward the models of ''Blair, Clinton and Obama,'' as he put it in a recent interview in his office in Florence City Hall, meaning he wants to move his party more to the center.
But the prospect of Mr. Renzi winning the primary, whose first round of voting is set for Sunday, has many fellow party members worried that he would drastically shift the core values of the party away from its roots -- it is the largest remaining heir to Italy's once influential Communist Party -- and risk opening an irreparable rift within its ranks.
Mr. Renzi argues that it is needed to save a party that grew rigid and ossified and lost influence in two decades of dominance by Mr. Berlusconi and his conservatives.
''His action is one of renewal -- not from within the party, but despite the party,'' said Diego Bianchi, a center-left political blogger, in a telephone interview. He and other critics of Mr. Renzi say he has remained on the fringes of the party machine rather than take part in internal debates. ''He has personalized the notion of leadership in a very showy way,'' he added. ''He gives off the sensation that he has his own story at heart, and that he has little to do with the history of the left.''
Mr. Renzi has unsettled matters further by appealing to Mr. Berlusconi's disillusioned voters to turn to the left in the next election. Many in his own party look with suspicion at Mr. Renzi's lengthening list of endorsements from conservatives.
In Mr. Berlusconi's paper Il Giornale, deputy editor Giuseppe de Bellis said Saturday that Mr. Renzi was ''the first possible center-left leader that we like.''
Mr. Renzi's supporters say he is trying to open up new, less ideological horizons at a fluid moment. ''The exit of Berlusconi frees up a river of centrist electors,'' said Antonio Funiciello, a Democratic Party member. ''I think our party should reflect on this, especially in the north. This clutching onto the old certainties of the left closes us off toward electors that could be open to a new government project.
''It's a high-risk move,'' he added, ''but with a high return.''
Mr. Renzi wants to appeal to young Italians whose job prospects have evaporated and who are hostage to the generational imbalance in Italy, where a gerontocracy holds the reins of power in politics, business and higher education.
One Monday this month, Mr. Renzi bounded onto a stage in Verbania, in the Piedmont region, to the strains of the pop song ''We Are Young,'' by Fun.
''This territory is rich, but it has been experiencing the crisis firsthand for years now,'' Mr. Renzi told the standing-room-only audience. ''It is a symbol of what Italy's going through. We want to use the primaries as a referendum on the future. We want to change Italy.''
Many believe that Mr. Renzi faces an uphill battle. ''Renzi is building on the ever stronger voices that Italy needs to renew and make room for young people,'' said Ernesto Galli della Loggia, a historian and columnist for the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera. ''But Italy is static, and there is a very strong resistance in society toward change.''
Like Beppe Grillo, the comedian turned political guru who has been channeling Italian discontent, Mr. Renzi speaks of a rupture with the past. While Mr. Grillo heads an antiestablishment movement bent on upending the political system, though, Mr. Renzi wants to change it from within.
A primary victory is far from assured for Mr. Renzi. Rivals include the party secretary, Pier Luigi Bersani, 61, thought to be the strongest candidate because he has the backing of the party's old guard, and others with established leftist credentials.
Whether or not he wins, Mr. Renzi-- who is polling at 30 percent -- has given his party a jolt, one that its leaders would do well to heed, some observers say.
''The party should listen to the 30 percent of its voters who are asking for a more modern, more liberal left, one that is able to interpret the needs of a changing Italian society,'' said Stefano Folli, a columnist for Il Sole 24 Ore.
In Verbania, Mr. Renzi drew applause attacking the political order, disparaging government waste and promising a brighter future, saying that Florence had done well during his tenure.
But critics like Claudio Fantoni, a Democratic Party member from Florence, say Mr. Renzi has misrepresented his record. Mr. Fantoni quit Mr. Renzi's cabinet in June, saying the mayor was overstretching the city's budget and delaying unpopular decisions to avoid denting his image.
Others have raised questions about Mr. Renzi's fund-raising. According to its Web site, his campaign raised about 160,000 euros, or about $207,500, in donations from citizens -- nowhere near enough, his critics say, to pay for his flashy campaign. Mr. Renzi counters that every penny has been accounted for. Donors are listed by name on his site.
Mr. Fantoni said Mr. Renzi was running a real risk of splitting the party. ''His attitude has been, 'Let me win and then we'll see,' '' he said. ''That is unacceptable.''

HEADLINE: Painting A Blood Bath In Sounds

BYLINE: By MEKADO MURPHY

 BODY:
THE struggle to win in a nation consumed by loss is one of the themes at the center of ''Killing Them Softly'' (due Nov. 30 from the Weinstein Company), a crime drama set during the 2008 election season, as the economic crisis is unfolding. Presidential addresses and campaign speeches play on television sets in the background throughout a movie in which sound is used in uncharacteristic ways to augment the narrative.
Directed by Andrew Dominik (''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'') and adapted from the George V. Higgins novel ''Cogan's Trade,'' the film is populated by small-time gangsters (including Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn in a cast that also includes Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini and Ray Liotta) who dream grandly but don't always proceed wisely. 
''Crime stories, to some extent, always felt like the capitalist ideal in motion,'' Mr. Dominik said recently, speaking by phone from Los Angeles. ''Because it's the one genre where it's perfectly acceptable for the characters to be motivated solely by money.''
A holdup at a mob-run card game creates tension and unease in the crime world, and an enforcer, Jackie Cogan (Mr. Pitt), is called in to restore order. This leads to takedowns, showdowns and one particular beat-down that has a stronger sting of brutality, primarily because every punch, smack, grunt and plea is precisely engineered.
In that scene, Markie Trattman (Mr. Liotta) is suspected of organizing the holdup. He is taken to an empty parking lot by two other gangsters (Trevor Long and Max Casella), and put through a savage interrogation. Here Mr. Dominik and the sound mixer, Leslie Shatz, discuss their ideas for the audio, including how flash bulbs, squeegees and Norman Mailer worked their way into a beating sequence. A multimedia feature including audio clips from the scene can be seen and heard here.
THE LOCATION Setting the scene in a parking lot with empty stores emphasized the recession-era time period, evoked not just by a ''Going Out of Business'' sign in a store window, but also by periodic news reports on TV and radio throughout the movie. But it also lent a sense of dread. ''You see fight scenes a lot'' in movies, Mr. Dominik said. ''But you don't see people systematically beating somebody else. The idea was just to make it really, really, really ugly.'' He and his crew shot in New Orleans and had several abandoned shopping malls to choose from. ''When we were on location scouts, we'd find out the next day that the place we looked at, there was a murder committed there hours after we'd been there,'' Mr. Dominik said. The sequence has no music, just dialogue and sound effects. ''What I prefer to do in films is not to use music as underscore,'' he said. ''If you're dealing with movies that have a lot of ambivalence about them, music can take away so many layers of a thing.'' Instead he uses sound to stir emotions that music often provokes.
THE CAR At the start of the scene Markie is ordered to get out of the car, and he reluctantly complies, knowing what's coming next. During the beating he makes direct contact with the car, whether slamming against it or sliding down the side of it. Those sounds were made during the Foley process, in which the mixer records sounds in time with the movie footage. ''In our Foley studio we have pieces of a car,'' Mr. Shatz said, speaking by phone from Wildfire Post, his studio in Los Angeles. ''So we will watch the movie and start banging on the car until we get the proper sound.'' For a moment when Mr. Liotta's character slides across the car they used audio of a squeegee across a windshield to achieve the effect. Another form of transportation, a train, also becomes significant, and its loud rush is used to bring the action to a climax.
THE PUNCHES Mr. Dominik and Mr. Shatz experimented with several techniques while developing the punching sounds in the scene. ''You always try to make a punch that feels right,'' Mr. Dominik said, ''because if your punches are too big, they don't seem real. But if they're too small, they don't feel violent.'' In some of the hits they used the sound of flash bulbs, which provide a kind of tingly aftereffect. They also occasionally muted all the other sound at moments of fist impact and mixed the dialogue into multiple channels, with discrete sounds coming from different directions, forcing the moviegoer to experience the moment more intimately. Also Mr. Shatz drew on an unlikely source: Norman Mailer. When Mailer directed the 1987 film version of his novel ''Tough Guys Don't Dance,'' he was unhappy with the way punches sounded in movies. So he suggested that Mr. Shatz record Mailer hitting himself. Those self-inflicted punches, in a recycled and modified form, became part of the punch audio for this scene.
THE RAIN Pounding and punishing, rain is heard in different ways and from different perspectives throughout the scene: as it hits the asphalt and the roof of the car and as it splashes on the faces of the actors. ''Rain is one of those movie conventions where, if you really listen to what it sounds like when it's raining, you can't use that in a movie: it's too light and indistinct.'' Mr. Shatz said. ''I have this recording of pouring water onto concrete, just splatting. It's a very hard kind of sound.'' That sound was looped (repeated into a sustained texture) and, when matched to the layers of sounds, became a discomforting underscore to the grisly proceedings. For the rain hitting the car Mr. Shatz used looped audio of water being poured onto metal. Also mixed in are rumbling thunder sounds. Mr. Dominik and Mr. Shatz also used a process called ''worldizing,'' in which they would take sounds, play them back in different environments, record the slightly altered versions and then switch between them to create an ambience.

HEADLINE: More Chips For Tax Reform

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
A contributing opinion writer and a counselor to the Treasury secretary in the first , Obama administration.

 BODY:
Almost lost in the tug of war over whether the top income tax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent is another consequential tax issue: the proper rate for capital gains and dividends.
It was the absurdly low rate on those forms of income - just 15 percent - that yielded Mitt Romney's embarrassingly small tax payments. And that's what also led to Warren E. Buffett's lament that his tax rate was lower than his secretary's.
So as we scurry around looking for new revenue to help address the yawning budget deficit, let's zero in on this special preference. 
President Obama has proposed much of the needed adjustment, including eliminating the special treatment of dividends and raising the tax on capital gains to 20 percent for the rich.
Personally, I would go further and raise the capital gains rate to 28 percent, right where it was during the strong recovery of Bill Clinton's first term, and grab hold of a total of $300 billion of new revenues over the next decade.
Inevitably, a chorus of outrage would greet any such increase. Capital investment would be severely impaired! Some of the wealthy might decamp from America! With a new 3.8 percent Medicare tax on unearned income about to take effect, this would exacerbate the disincentives for investment!
Put me down as skeptical about such dire forecasts. During my 30 years on Wall Street, taxes on "unearned income" have bounced up and down with regularity, and I've never detected any change in the appetite for hard work and accumulating wealth on the part of myself or any of my fellow capitalists.
Remember also that corporate leaders have pretty much convinced policy makers of both parties that business taxes should be reformed to allow them to compete more effectively around the globe. Providing this relief makes sense, but since the benefits would flow to shareholders, this is yet another argument for higher taxes on dividends.
Increased revenues, meaning higher taxes, will be a central element of any successful long-term budget plan, and President Obama is right to insist that the wealthy - the slice of America that has come through the recession in by far the best financial health - should provide those funds.
Here's the math: We need at least $4 trillion of long-term deficit reduction, with a substantial portion - on the order of $1.2 trillion - coming from new revenues.
That means other veins belonging to the wealthy will need to be tapped. Raising the tax rates for American households with incomes above $250,000 per year, as President Obama has proposed, would certainly be a productive and welcome step.
But viable alternative measures are available. At a minimum, we need to implement the "Buffett Rule," the concept that Americans making more than $1 million a year should pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. This wouldn't raise a huge amount of money - between $47 billion and $160 billion depending on what else is done to rates - but it would reinforce the responsibility of the wealthy to pay their fair share.
Another important step toward tax fairness would be to address the indefensibly low 15 percent tax rate on the famous "carried interest," the fee received by private equity and certain hedge fund investors.
As a beneficiary of the carried interest loophole, I've seen firsthand the lack of any difference between the work involved in generating a carried interest and the work done by millions of other professionals who are taxed at the full 35 percent rate.
Another productive area for raising revenue would be limiting deductions available to the wealthy. The highest-income Americans don't need tax-free health insurance, mortgage interest deductions or deferred taxation on retirement funds.
Mitt Romney himself proposed an efficient and effective approach: just limit the total amount of deductions. Even excluding charitable deductions from this limitation - as I would personally advocate - capping deductions at $25,000 would raise large amounts of revenue, an estimated $885 billion over the next 10 years.
While Mr. Romney called for applying the limitation to all Americans, a fairer approach would be to impose it only on the wealthiest.
These types of tax changes would have the ancillary benefit of defusing a specious argument that conservatives love to make: that raising the top rates on ordinary income would hurt small business.
Certainly no small business can claim to be damaged by a higher rate on dividends or capital gains or by the proprietor's losing some tax deductions.
So I'm all for raising rates as President Obama has proposed. But in a divided government, compromise is needed, and happily there are other chips that can be put on the table as we bargain over how to raise the needed revenue from the wealthy.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Alfredsson Trying to Understand Owners' Strategy

BYLINE: JEFF Z. KLEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Daniel Alfredsson, a member of the union's negotiating committee during the last lockout, could not figure the upside to putting the season in peril this time around. 

 BODY:
Daniel Alfredsson says he cannot understand what Commissioner Gary Bettman and the N.H.L. owners are trying to accomplish with their lockout.
"Last time around we knew what the league wanted - they had to get a cap," Alfredsson said Saturday night. "This time around I have a hard time seeing what their game plan is."
Alfredsson, speaking in the dressing room after Operation Hat Trick, a charity game in Atlantic City to benefit families affected by Hurricane Sandy, has not been alone in wondering why Bettman and the owners are risking their profitable business by remaining intransigent in negotiations despite the sides being so close on so many key issues. 
Alfredsson calls that "the frustrating part" of the lockout. He was on the players' association negotiating committee during the 2004-5 lockout, which resulted in the cancellation of the entire season. But that lockout made sense in that the N.H.L. was losing money and the owners could financially afford to sacrifice a season in an effort to get the players to accept a salary cap.
Now, however, the N.H.L. is a $3.3 billion business, and increasingly profitable. Bettman said last week that the lockout was costing the league $18 million to $20 million a day in lost revenue, roughly half of which would have gone to the owners. That comes to about $700 million the owners have lost so far.
The lockout has also angered sponsors, with the head of Molson Coors saying the company will seek reimbursement from the N.H.L. 
Yet Bettman and the owners seem intent on continuing it, even though the two sides are close enough for a quick resolution. 
They have gotten the players to agree to a 50-50 revenue split, leaving one substantial difference on economics: the owners have offered $211 million in deferred pay to "make whole" existing contracts over five years, while the players have asked for $393 million. 
That $182 million gap works out to about $1.2 million per team, per year over the proposed five-year deal - or about the cost of a third-line forward. 
The sides are also split on contract rights, but even those differences seem relatively minor in comparison to what the owners risk by losing a whole season. The owners want to add a year to both the age and the length of service a player must achieve in order to qualify for free agency (28 instead of 27, and eight years' experience instead of seven). The owners also want to limit contracts to five years, and the players seem willing to accept something closer to seven- or eight-year limit.
Yet the owners have not budged on those issues since the initial proposal they made over the summer. 
"Player contracting rights are vital on the players' side," Donald Fehr, the executive director of the players' association, said Saturday. "So far we don't have a recognition of that."
Union officials have wondered whether Bettman and the owners have a date in mind at which they will rake in the concessions they have won, compromise on unresolved issues and move to a quick settlement. Perhaps answering Alfredsson's question as to the owners' strategy.
If there is such a date, it could be Dec. 5, when the N.H.L. Board of Governors convenes in New York for its annual meeting. 
If the governors inform Bettman then that they want to settle, the season could start within a couple of weeks.
Under those circumstances, the hundreds of millions of dollars the owners will have lost would simply be the cost of doing business.

HEADLINE: Incredible Credibility

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Comparing the US and the UK. 

 BODY:
There's an interesting mix of contrast and similarity between the policy debates in Britain and the United States right now. In both countries -- as in every country that retains its own currency and has debts denominated in that national currency -- interest rates are near record lows: 
However, Very Serious People tell very different stories in the two nations. In the United States, we supposedly have low borrowing costs despite our budget deficit -- and if we don't implement Bowles-Simpson immediately, the bond vigilantes will attack. Really! This time we mean it!
Meanwhile, in the UK, the official line is that the low rates are a reward for all that fiscal austerity -- and VSPs get upset and abusive if someone well-informed points out that a much better explanation is that investors expect the economy to remain weak, and hence for short-term rates to remain very low, for a long time.
Let's unpack this a bit. It's very hard to come up with any reason why either the US or the UK might default, since they can simply print money if they need cash. And given the absence of real default risk, long-term interest rates should be more or less equal to an average of expected future short-term rates (not exactly, because of maturity risk, but that's a fairly minor detail).
So if you expect the US and UK economies to be depressed for a long time, with the central bank keeping rates low, long rates will be low too -- end of story.
But won't that money printing cause inflation? Not as long as the economy remains depressed. Budget deficits could lead people to expect higher inflation down the road, once the slump finally ends -- but that would be a good thing for the economy in the short run, discouraging people from sitting on cash and weakening the exchange rate, thereby making exports more competitive.
The point, then, is that the whole "credibility" argument is incoherent.

HEADLINE: A Short History of Takers

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's all about health care. 

 BODY:
NIcholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute is one of the unsung heroes of the recent election. His work claiming that we have become a nation of takers, reliant on the government to take care of us, helped define the tone and language with which Republicans talk to each other, especially when they don't think anyone else is listening; hence Romney's 47 percent remarks, and President Obama's road to reelection. Thanks! 
Now, many people have pointed out that Eberstadt's alleged evidence for the taker hypothesis is really mainly just saying that Medicare and Medicaid have gotten a lot more expensive. So I'm doing prep work for classes next semester, and I thought I'd just graph government transfer payments other than Medicare/Medicaid as a share of GDP. Here's what it looks like:
So, as I read it, this number shoots up in recessions and their aftermath, then declines again, hitting a low during the later Clinton years; but there's really no trend since the early 70s. 
Indeed: the taking thing is all about health care.

BYLINE: JEAN HUETS


HIGHLIGHT: What Civil War underwear tells us about the conflict, and the country. 

 BODY:
Civil War soldiers carried many valuables: letters from home, photographs, and locks of hair from wives, sweethearts and babies. But they held a less romantic article much nearer to their hearts, and sometimes much dearer: their undergarments. 
History favors epic battles, stirring speeches, presidents and generals and the economic and political forces that transform the lives of millions. Yet mere underwear has a story to tell, a story that covers the breadth of the Civil War, from home front to battlefield.
A full suit of mid-19th-century men's underwear consisted of a shirt, "drawers" and socks. Like today, men's underwear at the time, unlike women's, did not provide structure to the body. Rather, cover, warmth and hygiene were the order of the day - though the hygiene part did not always work out. The term for undershirt was usually just "shirt"; shirts as we know them today were often called blouses or top-shirts. Undershirts were square-cut pullovers, voluminous and long. Buttons and sometimes laces at the neck fastened them. 
Drawers, meanwhile, were sometimes knee-length, usually ankle-length. Two or three buttons closed a center fly. Lacing or a buckle at the back waistband adjusted the fit. Tape ties or drawstrings at the ankle (or knee) kept drawer legs from riding up. Possibly the drawstrings also functioned as sock garters. For many men of the period, shirt tails stood in for drawers. Ribbed and knit fabric primarily went to socks, which were nearly always woolen. When not hand-knit, the tubular body was knit at mills, with heels and toes added by hand.
Mills provided the fabric, which women pieceworkers assembled at home by hand and sewing machines. "In certain districts" of rural New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont, reported one New England manufacturer, "the whole female population is employed, in spare moments, at this work."
It's nearly impossible to imagine rural women enjoying "spare moments" while running farms in the absence of men, in addition to housekeeping and child care. Women who relied solely on piecework struggled as well. One "smart operator" finished four pairs of drawers daily, breaking "long enough to make herself a cup of tea and eat a piece of bread," reported The New York Times. For her 12-hour day, she earned 16 and a quarter cents. Women in mills might make even less. By comparison, a Union private earned about 43 cents a day, plus rations and clothing. Pieceworkers in New York and other cities organized, but contractors, or as The New York Sun described them, "fiends in the shape of men," continued to reap huge profits while "driving ten thousand working women into the very jaws of hell." 
For subsistence, patriotism, love or profit, women North and South worked hard to supplement Army-issue underwear, sometimes ripping their own clothes apart for fabric. And many soldiers, especially those in the South, preferred their underwear homemade; their wives, sisters and enslaved women stitched a variety of fabrics, especially canton flannel (cotton flannel fleeced on one side) and cotton-and-wool blend flannel, into drawers and shirts.
Recruits whose mothers never issued underpants could be fooled into wearing their new drawers on parade. They presented themselves in august company. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant himself once appeared in "parade uniform": one night, when gunboats threatened the depot at City Point, Va., reported an eyewitness in The Century magazine, "the general came hurriedly into the office. He had drawn on his top-boots over his drawers, and put on his uniform frock-coat, the skirt of which reached about to the tops of the boots and made up for the absence of trousers." 
Underwear was always in short supply. Prisoners of war suffered most. Lincoln's quartermaster general, Montgomery Meigs, stipulated that "from the 30th of April to the 1st of October neither drawers nor socks will be issued to prisoners of war, except to the sick." A Union prisoner testified that hundreds of his fellow captives went "without even a pair of drawers to cover their nakedness." 
Such shortages made underwear coveted spoils of war. When Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's men raided a Union supply depot, "sumptuous underclothing was fitted over limbs sunburnt, sore and vermin-splotched." A Confederate cadet spotted his own monogram on underwear worn by a Federal whose pants were cut open to tend a wound. The soldier confessed to looting a Lynchburg, Va., house where the cadet had stowed his trunk. 
Getting fresh underwear by issue, mail or pillage was easier than laundering and carrying extra. One Confederate soldier, Carlton McCarthy, preferred to wear all his clothes "until the enemy's knapsacks or the folks at home supplied a change. Certainly it did not pay to carry around clean clothes while waiting for the time to use them."
Francis Ackerman, a volunteer from New York, gleaned fresh clothes from the fields at the Third Battle of Winchester, in September 1864. His account of finding a riderless horse mingles the grotesque tragedy of battle with the dry humor so characteristic of War memoirs. "I discovered a horse with one of his legs shot off, on his back a good outfit," he wrote. "Feeling rather lively from life inside my clothes," he "concluded to examine the wounded horse, and was rewarded by finding a clean full suit of underwear. I stripped on the battle field, and with thankful heart put it on, the first change I had in six weeks." More fastidious men changed into clean underwear faithfully - once a week. 
Regardless of how often one changed his drawers, the louse ruled. "It preyed alike on the just and the unjust. It inserted its bill as confidingly into the body of the major-general as of the lowest private," wrote one memoirist. Laundering in boiling water didn't rout the "gray backs"; instead, taking a page from their battlefield playbooks, soldiers relied on "skirmishing," or painstaking search-and-destroy efforts to pick them off one by one. 
In any case, boiling underwear could get a man into hot water. When Gen. Thomas Lanier Clingman of North Carolina wrote his mother to send drawers, she answered back, "I am certain that your flannel is injured by washing. It should not be put in very hot water or boiled at all," and it should be washed in "moderately warm water with soap and rinsed in warm soap suds, which will keep it soft and free from shrinking. At least, you can direct your washer to do so." General Clingman was 50 years old when his mom told him how to wash his underwear.
Even clean and vermin-free, underwear was rarely comfortable. Harsh laundering subtracted durability and comfort. Availability and cost, not fit or season, dictated cut and fabric. In summer a soldier sweltered in flannel or discarded his drawers and got chafed raw by rough, sweaty wool pants. 
The manufacture and use of underwear reflects several aspects of the Civil War, and it holds a mirror to our own times. Labor was both empowered and exploited by the cascade of contract money that poured in for its production, which in turn helped usher in the corruption and wealth of the Gilded Age. Slavery and regionalism weren't the only things that fractured our country. A chasm existed between the "dainty men" in their boiled shirts and the common herd in homespun plaid and flannel, between impoverished millworkers and pieceworkers - often immigrants - and women whose elegance was purchased by their husbands' manufacturing enterprises.
Most of all, the humble suit of underwear highlights the Civil War soldier himself: his endurance and fortitude, his ability to make do with whatever conditions and supplies came along and his sense of humor, which pervades even the most dire accounts of battle and camp life.

HEADLINE: New York State Creating 5,000 Temporary Jobs in Storm-Stricken Areas

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Cuomo administration said hiring in New York City, in the Lower Hudson Valley and on Long Island would be focused on young people as well as the long-term unemployed. 

 BODY:
New York State will hire more than 5,000 unemployed residents in temporary positions to help clean up debris and distribute supplies in areas stricken by Hurricane Sandy, the Cuomo administration announced on Sunday. 
The jobs will pay roughly $15 an hour and could last as long as six months. They will be available to residents in the communities that were most affected by the storm, including areas of New York City, Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley.
State officials said that hiring would be focused on young people as well as the long-term unemployed, and that the positions would be financed by a grant of nearly $28 million from the federal government.
"The enormous amount of work to be done gives us a chance to provide young and unemployed New Yorkers with job opportunities cleaning up their communities," Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement. 
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, added that the jobs would "provide valuable work experience and on-the-job training that can be useful in future careers."
To be eligible for the positions, prospective workers must be unemployed, at least 18 and live on Long Island, in the five boroughs of New York City or in Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster or Westchester Counties. Residents can apply for jobs by calling 1-888-469-7365 or by filling out an online form.
The state labor commissioner, Peter M. Rivera, said on Sunday that 800 people had already signed up for temporary jobs as part of the program. Some were scheduled to begin working as early as Monday. 
"We need to get the word out as quickly as we can," Mr. Rivera said.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is also starting a separate program to hire New Yorkers to replace agency employees, many of them from out of state, who have been working in the region since the hurricane struck. The agency said Sunday that upward of 700 positions would be available as part of its program.

HEADLINE: Study Questions Tax Breaks' Effect on Retirement Savings

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Every year, the government spends more than $100 billion on tax breaks to encourage Americans to save more for retirement. But a new study suggests such provisions may have little effect on the amount Americans save. 

 BODY:
Every year, the government spends more than $100 billion on tax breaks to encourage Americans to save more for retirement. But a new study suggests such provisions may have little effect on the amount Americans save.
The finding has particular relevance as Congress looks for ways to raise revenue by reducing tax breaks as part of the year-end budget negotiations.
The researchers - Raj Chetty and John N. Friedman of Harvard, Soren Leth-Petersen and Tore Olsen of the University of Copenhagen, and Torben Heien Nielsen of the Danish National Center for Social Research - looked at Danish data, in part because analogous American numbers are much less detailed. Although there is no way to know whether the patterns in Denmark and the United States are identical, the two countries have similar pension systems, and the new research fits with previous findings about how Americans save. 
The researchers found that every dollar that the Danish government spent on tax breaks increased total savings by about only one cent. In contrast, policies that automatically saved a portion of a worker's income increased total savings by a substantial amount.
William G. Gale, a tax expert at the Brookings Institution, said the new research was remarkable. Automatic savings systems, Mr. Gale said, "have proven remarkably effective in raising 401(k) participation rates and to some extent contribution rates, if done right." But it has not been clear whether people offset those increases by saving less elsewhere, he added.
Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia Business School and a top Republican economist, said in an e-mail about the new research that he believed low taxes on savings still benefited the economy over the long term. But, he said, saving incentives may be less powerful for the less well-off.
President Obama and Congressional leaders recently started talks to prevent hundreds of billions of dollars of tax increases and spending cuts from taking effect in January. Leaders of both parties say they want to enact policies that would do less damage to the economy in the short term while still reducing the deficit. But their plans differ.
Mr. Obama has said he wants to increase tax revenue by about $1.6 trillion over 10 years, with all new revenue coming from taxes on high-income households. Republicans leaders have signaled that they prefer closer to $800 billion in additional tax revenue, all of it coming from the reduction of tax breaks and faster economic growth, rather than higher tax rates.
The tax breaks for retirement savings are among the largest tax expenditures, along with those for employer-provided health insurance and mortgage interest. About 80 percent of retirement-savings benefits flow to households in the top fifth of earners - those making at least $100,000 - according to the Tax Policy Center in Washington.
In studying the tax data, the Danish and American researchers identified two main types of savers. About 85 percent of Danes were "passive" savers, who tended to be less responsive to government policies and less wealthy. The remaining 15 percent were "active" savers, who were more responsive and richer.
When the government reduced a tax break for retirement savings, passive savers barely changed their behavior. By contrast, automatic savings programs had more impact on them, causing the passive savers to put away more money for retirement, said Mr. Chetty, who recently won a so-called genius grant from the MacArthur Foundation.
Active savers also responded to tax breaks that change - but by shifting money between accounts that come with tax advantages and other accounts, not by changing the amount they put away. The automatic savings programs also had little effect on active savers' overall balances.
The researchers, who have been presenting their findings at academic seminars, said they planned to submit the paper to an academic journal this week.
The researchers conclude that tax breaks do not increase the overall level of savings by much, and do not tend to change the behavior of most workers - particularly the less wealthy, who often need the most help in preparing for retirement.
"The findings reported here call into question whether subsidies are the best policy tool to increase retirement savings," the authors write. "Our findings strengthen recent arguments for using 'nudges' such as automatic payroll deductions or savings defaults to stimulate retirement savings instead of subsidies."
In a typical default program, an employer or government agency automatically directs a portion of workers' earnings to a savings account, although the employees have the option of increasing or decreasing the amount. Most American employers lack a default program, and workers who take no action save nothing.
The biggest question concerning the new study about Denmark is why it deserves attention when dozens of prominent researchers have written hundreds of papers on retirement saving programs and subsidies in this country.
The researchers argue that the answer is in the data. The Danish government keeps much more detailed numbers on retirement accounts and savings patterns. So while there has never been a conclusive answer to the question of whether Washington's tax breaks on retirement savings raise the overall level of saving, the researchers believe they have found the answer in Denmark.
Ultimately, for Washington, the policy implications could be considerable.
The year-end debt talks between Congressional leaders and the White House have the potential to start a larger effort to overhaul the tax code next year, and the $1 trillion a year in breaks in the tax code are expected to come under scrutiny.
The money that the government spends to encourage Americans to save for retirement is money that cannot be spent on deficit reduction, education, health care or other priorities. The study suggests that the money has little effect on the retirement security of lower-income families, either.
On top of that, economists and policy experts have warned about a crisis in retirement security because of the decline in defined-benefit pensions, significant fiscal problems in public retirement programs, the ravages of the recession and the housing bust.
Low-cost policy changes, like requiring employers to put a portion of workers' paychecks into a retirement fund, might help millions of households save for a secure retirement without driving Washington deeper into the red.

HEADLINE: Debt Reckoning: The Fiscal Deadline in Washington

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The Times is starting a new online feature Monday to follow the talks between President Obama and Congressional leaders over the so-called fiscal cliff. 

 BODY:
The New York Times is starting a new online feature on Monday to follow the talks between President Obama and Congressional leaders over the so-called fiscal cliff. In the weeks ahead we will use this space to track developments from the White House and Capitol Hill, explain the major economic and fiscal issues, examine public opinion and analyze the options that the parties are considering, among other things. Follow along at Debt Reckoning: The Fiscal Deadline in Washington. 
Some of the items will run in the newspaper, and others will be only online. We welcome questions from readers in the comments section or on Twitter @thecaucus.
As a starting point, we suggest:
 Jackie Calmes's recent Q&A on how the government ended up in this situation and what parts of the budget are affected by the Jan. 1 deadline.
 Annie Lowrey's recent article on the debate over whether the deadline should be called a "cliff," a "slope" or something else entirely.
 Recent reports from Jennifer Steinhauer and Jonathan Weisman on the talks and on the Republican leaders. (Boehner Tells House G.O.P. to Fall in Line, Seeking Ways to Raise Taxes but Leave Tax Rate As Is, Back on Hill, Ryan Remains a Fiscal Force)
 My recent Sunday Review column on Mr. Obama's negotiating position. 
 Matt Bai's Times Magazine story on the failed 2011 budget talks between Mr. Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner, which formed the background of these talks.
 The Times's 2010 budget calculator, which allows readers to solve the deficit themselves. (The calculator assumes that some expiring provisions like the tax cuts from various Obama administration stimulus bills will indeed disappear, while others with a longer history - the Bush tax cuts, changes to the Alternative Minimum Tax and Medicare physician payments - will remain on the books.)

HEADLINE: A Minimum Tax for the Wealthy

BYLINE: By WARREN E. BUFFETT. 
Warren E. Buffett is the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway.

 BODY:
Omaha
SUPPOSE that an investor you admire and trust comes to you with an investment idea. ''This is a good one,'' he says enthusiastically. ''I'm in it, and I think you should be, too.''
Would your reply possibly be this? ''Well, it all depends on what my tax rate will be on the gain you're saying we're going to make. If the taxes are too high, I would rather leave the money in my savings account, earning a quarter of 1 percent.'' Only in Grover Norquist's imagination does such a response exist. 
Between 1951 and 1954, when the capital gains rate was 25 percent and marginal rates on dividends reached 91 percent in extreme cases, I sold securities and did pretty well. In the years from 1956 to 1969, the top marginal rate fell modestly, but was still a lofty 70 percent -- and the tax rate on capital gains inched up to 27.5 percent. I was managing funds for investors then. Never did anyone mention taxes as a reason to forgo an investment opportunity that I offered.
Under those burdensome rates, moreover, both employment and the gross domestic product (a measure of the nation's economic output) increased at a rapid clip. The middle class and the rich alike gained ground.
So let's forget about the rich and ultrarich going on strike and stuffing their ample funds under their mattresses if -- gasp -- capital gains rates and ordinary income rates are increased. The ultrarich, including me, will forever pursue investment opportunities.
And, wow, do we have plenty to invest. The Forbes 400, the wealthiest individuals in America, hit a new group record for wealth this year: $1.7 trillion. That's more than five times the $300 billion total in 1992. In recent years, my gang has been leaving the middle class in the dust.
A huge tail wind from tax cuts has pushed us along. In 1992, the tax paid by the 400 highest incomes in the United States (a different universe from the Forbes list) averaged 26.4 percent of adjusted gross income. In 2009, the most recent year reported, the rate was 19.9 percent. It's nice to have friends in high places.
The group's average income in 2009 was $202 million -- which works out to a ''wage'' of $97,000 per hour, based on a 40-hour workweek. (I'm assuming they're paid during lunch hours.) Yet more than a quarter of these ultrawealthy paid less than 15 percent of their take in combined federal income and payroll taxes. Half of this crew paid less than 20 percent. And -- brace yourself -- a few actually paid nothing.
This outrage points to the necessity for more than a simple revision in upper-end tax rates, though that's the place to start. I support President Obama's proposal to eliminate the Bush tax cuts for high-income taxpayers. However, I prefer a cutoff point somewhat above $250,000 -- maybe $500,000 or so.
Additionally, we need Congress, right now, to enact a minimum tax on high incomes. I would suggest 30 percent of taxable income between $1 million and $10 million, and 35 percent on amounts above that. A plain and simple rule like that will block the efforts of lobbyists, lawyers and contribution-hungry legislators to keep the ultrarich paying rates well below those incurred by people with income just a tiny fraction of ours. Only a minimum tax on very high incomes will prevent the stated tax rate from being eviscerated by these warriors for the wealthy.
Above all, we should not postpone these changes in the name of ''reforming'' the tax code. True, changes are badly needed. We need to get rid of arrangements like ''carried interest'' that enable income from labor to be magically converted into capital gains. And it's sickening that a Cayman Islands mail drop can be central to tax maneuvering by wealthy individuals and corporations.
But the reform of such complexities should not promote delay in our correcting simple and expensive inequities. We can't let those who want to protect the privileged get away with insisting that we do nothing until we can do everything.
Our government's goal should be to bring in revenues of 18.5 percent of G.D.P. and spend about 21 percent of G.D.P. -- levels that have been attained over extended periods in the past and can clearly be reached again. As the math makes clear, this won't stem our budget deficits; in fact, it will continue them. But assuming even conservative projections about inflation and economic growth, this ratio of revenue to spending will keep America's debt stable in relation to the country's economic output.
In the last fiscal year, we were far away from this fiscal balance -- bringing in 15.5 percent of G.D.P. in revenue and spending 22.4 percent. Correcting our course will require major concessions by both Republicans and Democrats.
All of America is waiting for Congress to offer a realistic and concrete plan for getting back to this fiscally sound path. Nothing less is acceptable.
In the meantime, maybe you'll run into someone with a terrific investment idea, who won't go forward with it because of the tax he would owe when it succeeds. Send him my way. Let me unburden him.

HEADLINE: Congo Slips Into Chaos Again as Rebels Gain

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo -- The lights are out in most of Goma. There is little water. The prison is an empty, garbage-strewn wasteland with its rusty front gate swinging wide open and a three-foot hole punched through the back wall, letting loose 1,200 killers, rapists, rogue soldiers and other criminals.
Now, rebel fighters are going house to house arresting people, many of whom have not been seen again by their families.
''You say the littlest thing and they disappear you,'' said an unemployed man named Luke. 
In the past week, the rebels have been unstoppable, steamrolling through one town after another, seizing this provincial capital, and eviscerating a chaotic Congolese Army whose drunken soldiers stumble around with rocket-propelled grenades and whose chief of staff was suspended for selling crates of ammunition to elephant poachers.
Riots are exploding across the country -- in Bukavu, Butembo, Bunia, Kisangani and Kinshasa, the capital, a thousand miles away. Mobs are pouring into streets, burning down government buildings and demanding the ouster of Congo's weak and widely despised president, Joseph Kabila.
Once again, chaos is courting Congo. And one pressing question is, why -- after all the billions of dollars spent on peacekeepers, the recent legislation passed on Capitol Hill to cut the link between the illicit mineral trade and insurrection, and all the aid money and diplomatic capital -- is this vast nation in the heart of Africa descending to where it was more than 10 years ago when foreign armies and marauding rebels carved it into fiefs?
''We haven't really touched the root cause,'' said Aloys Tegera, a director for the Pole Institute, a research institute in Goma.
He said Congo's chronic instability is rooted in very local tensions over land, power and identity, especially along the Rwandan and Ugandan borders. ''But no one wants to touch this because it's too complicated,'' he added.
The most realistic solution, said another Congo analyst, is not a formal peace process driven by diplomats but ''a peace among all the dons, like Don Corleone imposed in New York.''
Congo's problems have been festering for years, wounds that never quite scabbed over.
But last week there was new urgency after hundreds of rebel fighters, wearing rubber swamp boots and with belt-fed machine guns slung across their backs, marched into Goma, the capital of North Kivu Province and one of the country's most important cities.
The rebels, called the M23, are a heavily armed paradox. On one hand, they are ruthless. Human rights groups have documented how they have slaughtered civilians, pulling confused villagers out of their huts in the middle of the night and shooting them in the head.
On the other hand, the M23 are able administrators -- seemingly far better than the Congolese government, evidenced by a visit in recent days to their stronghold, Rutshuru, a small town about 45 miles from Goma.
In Rutshuru, there are none of those ubiquitous plastic bags twisted in the trees, like in so many other parts of Congo. The gravel roads have been swept clean and the government offices are spotless. Hand-painted signs read: ''M23 Stop Corruption.'' The rebels even have green thumbs, planting thousands of trees in recent months to fight soil erosion.
''We are not a rebellion,'' said Benjamin Mbonimpa, an electrical engineer, a bush fighter and now a top rebel administrator. ''We are a revolution.''
Their aims, he said, were to overthrow the government and set up a more equitable, decentralized political system. This is why the rebels have balked at negotiating with Mr. Kabila, though this weekend several rebels said that the pressure was increasing on them to compromise, especially coming from Western countries.
On Sunday, rebel forces and government troops were still squared off, just a few miles apart, down the road from Goma.
The M23 rebels are widely believed to be covertly supported by Rwanda, which has a long history of meddling in Congo, its neighbor blessed with gold, diamonds and other glittering mineral riches. The Rwandan government strenuously denies supplying weapons to the M23 or trying to annex eastern Congo. Rwanda has often denied any clandestine involvement in this country, only to have the denials later exposed as lies.
Many people in Goma don't like the fact that the M23 is so closely linked to Rwanda, with Rwandan-speaking soldiers strutting around this city as if they own it -- which they do right now. But the venom toward Mr. Kabila seems even greater.
''He treats us like street kids,'' said Kalimbiro Kambere, a police officer who makes only $50 a month, despite 37 years in service. ''No one wants to fight for him.''
Few countries in the world have been as disastrously ruled as Congo. Western interference has not helped -- from the 1880s when King Leopold II of Belgium turned Congo into an enormous labor camp to produce as much rubber and ivory as possible, to the violence in the Goma area today, which may have been set into motion by a miscalculation on the part of Western ambassadors.
Last November, Mr. Kabila ran for re-election. He was widely unpopular, suspected of hoarding millions if not billions of dollars from mineral deals and leaving the bridges, roads, hospitals and schools a fiasco.
During the election, his agents were caught red-handed stuffing ballot boxes, and his soldiers gunned down opposition supporters who protested. But Western diplomats, though expressing unhappiness, did not press the case.
Several Congolese and Western rights advocates and analysts said that the diplomatic corps then urged Mr. Kabila to arrest Bosco Ntaganda, a Rwandan-speaking army general nicknamed the Terminator, who had been a commander in several brutal rebel groups and was wanted for years by the International Criminal Court on war crimes charges.
''Kabila miscalculated,'' Mr. Tegera said. ''And so did the West. They pressured him.''
In March, as Mr. Kabila began to move against Mr. Ntaganda and threatened to dislodge the Rwandan-speaking rebels who had been incorporated into the national army, they mutinied. They were far more powerful than the government expected, and United Nations officials said the rebels quickly drew reinforcements from Rwanda. They seized town after town, culminating in Goma, where power lines were cut in the fighting, casting it into darkness. At each battle, the government army unraveled.
The bodies of government soldiers now litter the roads around Goma, someone's father or son rotting in the bush, eye sockets and mouth sizzling with flies. Villagers trudge past, looking away. For them, misery is a familiar face.
On Friday, Alfonse Kiburura stood in front of his twig and tarp hut in a camp for displaced people. The rains are falling hard now, every day. His family curls up on a floor of cold, wet mud.
This was the second time this year that the Kibururas have had to pick up everything they own, throw it over their heads and dash down the road away from the combat. Mr. Kiburura said that as soon as his 5-year-old son, Destin, heard gunfire, the boy knew what to do.
''This isn't the first time he's heard gunshots,'' he said. ''He's heard them many times before.''

HEADLINE: An Abrupt End to San Diego's Signature Newspaper Family

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- By all accounts, David C. Copley felt liberated three years ago after selling The San Diego Union-Tribune, the newspaper that his family had bought 81 years earlier and had used to champion San Diego's metamorphosis from a sleepy town to America's eighth-largest city. He had served for years as publisher, it seemed to those close to him, out of familial duty.
So after the sale, he pursued his passions full time, devoting himself to the arts; taking Mediterranean cruises aboard his yacht, Happy Days; and tinkering with his collection of fast cars, like the emerald green Aston Martin he drove to the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego last Tuesday. Mr. Copley presided at a board meeting there, but he left early after complaining that he did not feel well.
Mr. Copley, 60, was just a few minutes' drive from Fox Hill, the family estate where the Copleys once entertained the Nixons, Hollywood stars and visiting royalty. But he suffered a heart attack and crashed into a parked car on a palm-tree-lined street half a block from the museum. 
The death of Mr. Copley, who had no heirs, marked the end of the newspaper family's involvement in a city that bears the Copley name on its symphony hall and many other institutions. It came at the twilight of an era in California when powerful newspaper families dominated growing young cities and, over a few short decades, helped turn the state into the nation's most populous and influential.
''These families were the chief oligarchs of their community,'' said Kevin Starr, a history professor at the University of Southern California, explaining that the state's emerging cities had few institutions to underpin their rapid growth. ''Newspapers were the institutions. They helped define these overnight cities. You have a very powerful relationship in the 20th century between regional newspapers in California and the development of these regions.''
The lives and exploits of some, like the Hearsts of The San Francisco Examiner or the Chandlers of The Los Angeles Times, became material for classic movies.
Harold Fuson, a longtime executive at Copley Press, said, ''The Copleys were not the Chandlers, and nobody's made 'Chinatown' out of them.'' But the Copleys ruled in San Diego, the way the McClatchys did in the Central Valley with The Sacramento Bee and The Fresno Bee, the Ridders in Silicon Valley with The San Jose Mercury News, and the Leshers in the East Bay with The Contra Costa Times.
In the last decade or two, most families sold off their newspapers or became passive executives as the growing number of cousins in the third or fourth generation lost interest in the family business.
Copley Press outlasted the other California dynasties, but it faced a different problem after Mr. Copley's mother, Helen, died in 2004. ''We were down to one last guy,'' Mr. Fuson said.
It was Mr. Copley's grandfather Ira C. Copley, a retired colonel and future Republican congressman, who started accumulating newspapers in Illinois in 1905 to begin his political career. He bought The San Diego Union, a morning newspaper, and The Evening Tribune in 1928. In keeping with his roots, the newspapers, which merged in 1992, remained staunch supporters of the military and of moderate to conservative Republican causes.
In the decades after World War II, Ira Copley's older son, James, led Copley Press, which eventually included 15 newspapers in California and the Midwest. James Copley was among a handful of men who made decisions about San Diego's future. He was a leader in the city's most important clubs and boards, and he established the family foundation that has donated millions over the years to support the city's institutions. His newspapers championed successful efforts to establish the University of California, San Diego, as well as to bring in sports teams and build a stadium, which for nearly two decades was named after his leading sports columnist, Jack Murphy.
In 1965, James Copley married his longtime secretary, Helen Kinney, who led the company after his death in 1973. He also adopted David, then 13, her son from a first marriage. David, who had grown up in modest circumstances, found himself the heir to the Copley empire, a fact that never made him comfortable.
''He never forgot how lucky he was and that it was a twist of fate that put him in this remarkable position,'' said Judith Harris, one of his closest friends. ''That weighed heavily on him. He continued to question, 'Am I living up to what I've been blessed with?' ''
David was transplanted to Fox Hill -- atop La Jolla, this city's wealthy, coastal enclave -- where his parents held grand balls to raise money for the city's hospitals and museums, and hundreds mingled around the pool and in the gardens. Fox Hill also served as a sort of Blair House for visiting dignitaries to San Diego, said Judith Morgan, who worked as a reporter for the newspaper and whose husband, Neil, was its most famous columnist.
''They entertained,'' Ms. Morgan said, recalling one of the many soirees to which she and her husband were invited. ''King and Queen of Spain came for dinner -- I don't know what they were doing in town, frankly. Sophia and Juan Carlos, good grief.''
To critics, though, the Copleys' newspapers failed to produce the hard-hitting journalism needed in an increasingly sophisticated and diverse city.
''The Copleys ran the paper as if it were still a small town,'' said Dean Nelson, the director of the journalism program at Point Loma Nazarene University here. ''The city of San Diego grew faster than the paper did.''
After a scandal involving the city employees' pension fund was discovered a decade ago, some, including Buzz Woolley, a venture capitalist and a Republican, believed that the Union-Tribune did not report on it because the Copleys were too friendly with City Hall. Mr. Woolley financed the creation of an online alternative, Voice of San Diego.
David Copley had assumed control over Copley Press by the time his mother died; Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $1.2 billion. He was often seen in reports on the newspaper's social pages, but he was shy in the wider public and seemed a reluctant newspaper baron.
''It's a role that was cast on him, and he accepted it,'' said Bob Witty, a former high-ranking editor at the newspaper. ''But it's not something he would have chosen, probably.''
With the downturn in the newspaper industry, Copley Press sold off its other newspapers, and the empire eventually shrank to its flagship newspaper. Then in 2009, Mr. Copley sold the Union-Tribune to Platinum Equity, a Beverly Hills investment firm. ''Once he'd crossed the bridge, I think, he felt somewhat liberated,'' said Mr. Fuson, the longtime Copley Press executive.
Mr. Copley never granted interviews, even to his own newspapers. But on Christmas Day in 2008, in keeping with family tradition, he wrote a publisher's holiday message, his last one. With the recession at home and wars overseas, he wrote of finding strength in family, friends and community. Let's celebrate, he said, San Diego's ''diversity, its unique mix of surfers and scientists, actors and academics, high-tech, biotech and no-tech.''
''Is there,'' he wrote, ''anywhere on the planet as beautiful as San Diego?''

HEADLINE: With Ban on Drilling Practice, Town Lands in Thick of Dispute

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
LONGMONT, Colo. -- This old farming town near the base of the Rocky Mountains has long been considered a conservative next-door neighbor to the ultraliberal college town of Boulder, a place bisected by the railroad and where middle-class families found a living at the vegetable cannery, sugar mill and Butterball turkey plant.
But this month, Longmont became the first town in Colorado to outlaw hydraulic fracturing, the oil-drilling practice commonly known as fracking. The ban has propelled Longmont to the fiercely contested forefront of the nation's antifracking movement, inspiring other cities to push for similar prohibitions. 
But it has also set the city on a collision course with oil companies and the State of Colorado.
''People really didn't think through this too well,'' Mayor Dennis L. Coombs said, sounding weary at the prospect of an onslaught of lawsuits. ''We are where we are. I guess you have to respect the people.''
In a way, Longmont's fracking ban is in a position similar to Colorado's ballot measure legalizing small amounts of marijuana for recreational use. Both are lessons in the promise and peril of populism: both initiatives sailed through on Election Day despite opposition from the authorities, and both now face legal scrutiny and fights at all levels of government.
Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, has warned Longmont residents that the ban is likely to mean a lawsuit from the state, which insists that only it has the authority to regulate drilling. Already this summer, Colorado sued Longmont over earlier city rules that limit drilling near schools and homes.
Local leaders are also bracing for more lawsuits as they tell energy companies they can no longer frack their wells -- a process that involves injecting thousands of gallons of pressurized water, sand and chemicals deep into the earth to fissure the rock and extract the oil and gas locked inside.
The ban does not outlaw all drilling, only the specific practice of hydraulic fracturing within the city limits, as well as the storage and disposal of waste created by the process.
''We're going contrary to state laws,'' said Bill Swenson, one of seven former mayors of Longmont who fought the ban. ''We are, in effect, taking your property.''
Fracking has allowed drillers to unlock huge new reservoirs of oil and natural gas over the past few years, and has kick-started economies from North Dakota to western Pennsylvania to here in northern Colorado. The industry says the practice is environmentally safe, but opponents have raised concerns about water contamination and air pollution while objecting to islands of well pads and forests of drilling towers in their communities.
The Colorado Oil and Gas Association, the main lobbying group for the energy industry here, criticized the ban as confrontational and encroaching on the private property of companies that have rights to oil and gas buried deep beneath Longmont's streets, parks and reservoirs.
''Are the taxpayers of Longmont prepared to provide fair compensation to all of the oil and gas lease holders in Longmont?'' said Tisha Schuller, the group's president.
Supporters of the ban call it a ''citizen uprising'' against a rush of drilling that has spread like brush fire through towns across the plains of northern Colorado.
In nearby Firestone, wells sit within a few hundred feet of libraries, schools and subdivisions. In Greeley, herds of tanker trucks line up at city fire hydrants at dawn to load water for fracking. Earlier this year, a federal scientist reported finding elevated levels of propane and benzene in the air around Erie. City officials and environmental advocates have even led fracking tours of communities where drilling is at its peak.
When people learned of plans to sink wells in Longmont near the Union Reservoir and a playground and recreational area on the east end of town, a response began to coalesce: not here. Supporters said the state's decision to sue over Longmont's regulations stiffened their resolve.
At the start, the ban seemed like a doomed idea.
The energy industry poured money and resources into fighting it, raising more than $500,000 to send out mailers and buy advertisements saying the ban would drive away businesses and incite expensive court battles. The major newspapers in Denver, Boulder and Longmont all urged voters to reject the proposal.
''I had no idea we could upset an entire state government and a trillion-dollar industry,'' said Michael Bellmont, an insurance agent who helped gather thousands of signatures and knocked on doors to persuade voters.
Advocates of the ban focused less on climate change and environmental concerns than on hitting voters where they lived: Do you want oil wells venting near your backyard? Do you want drilling near your schools?
The industry said the arguments were based on fear-mongering, deception and antifracking hysteria, but they resonated with voters. The ban passed 60 percent to 40 percent, with broad bipartisan support.
One recent afternoon, a few supporters who helped get the ban passed drove through town to visit some of the ''red sites'' -- areas that had been leased for drilling, or could be in the future. They drove past public parks, open spaces and golf courses and stopped at the Union Reservoir, still and limpid under a cloudy sky.
''There's a swim beach, there's sailing, and there will be eight well pads,'' said Kaye Fissinger, a supporter of the ban, pointing out potential drilling sites in the distance. ''You come out here to relax. You don't come out here to have your air polluted.''

HEADLINE: European Nations Try to Balance Student-Mobility Costs

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL

 BODY:
AMSTERDAM -- When school began in September, comments by a Flemish education official brought attention to a debate over whether it was fair for Belgium, which has lower tuition fees, to be paying to educate students migrating from the Netherlands.
''Some E.U. countries make their education unaffordable at home, and that makes other countries carry the burden,'' Noel Vercruysse, an official at the Flemish Ministry of Education and Training, was quoted as saying in De Standaard, a Flemish daily newspaper published in Belgium.
He calculated that one student each year cost the Belgian government about &#x20ac;10,000, or nearly $13,000.
''It is problematic if we have a large group of students from outside our society that we need to finance,'' Mr. Vercruysse said. ''Most of the Dutch students go back to the Netherlands.'' 
His criticism reflected a broader concern about how European nations should share the cost of educating their students.
''It's the sort of story that you see at the beginning of almost every academic year in countries around Europe,'' Adam Tyson, head of higher education at the Directorate General for Education and Culture, part of the European Commission, said in a telephone interview. ''There were questions about German students' going to Austria to study medicine and dentistry for a few years. There are flows all around Europe. There are German and British students coming into the Netherlands. Within the Nordic countries, there's a quite large flow from Sweden and Finland into Denmark.''
After Mr. Vercruysse's comments, newspapers reported that the number of Dutch students crossing over to Flanders -- a Dutch-speaking part of Belgium -- had increased every year for a decade and was expected to rise further in 2012-13. Tuition at universities in the Netherlands costs &#x20ac;1,771, compared with &#x20ac;578 in Belgium. As in most of continental Europe, university education is financed almost entirely by taxpayers, making tuition relatively low compared with countries like the United States or Britain.
Mr. Vercruysse was reprimanded for speaking out of turn and Belgian officials dismissed his comments. He declined to be interviewed for this article.
''At the time this public servant was saying that, he was a little confused,'' the Flemish education minister, Pascal Smet, said in a telephone interview. ''We don't see it as a problem today. If we really want a Europe of tomorrow, it's only logical that people will go study in other member states.''
The number of students crossing the border is still relatively small. Mr. Smet said 5,573 Dutch citizens were receiving their education in Belgium, which is 2.6 percent of the Belgian student population. The proportion has doubled from 1.3 percent 10 years ago.
''The figures are not that problematic at this time,'' Mr. Smet said, ''but we see that the numbers are mounting, so we do need to monitor it.''
European student mobility is a key principle of the Bologna Process, which seeks to promote exchanges among the 47 nations of the European Higher Education Area. The European courts have confirmed that students from participating nations must be granted the same rights and privileges, including identical study fees, in any other member nation.
The issue is expected to arise in Berlin next week at the first meeting of the Bologna Process Working Group on Mobility. Despite efforts to minimize the issue in Belgium, it has not gone away.
''You hear it in papers, you hear it from political parties, and you hear it also when people speak about budget cuts and links to the economic situation,'' said Ludo Melis, vice president for educational policy at the University of Leuven.
The largest university in Belgium, it has 40,000 students, including 1,600 Dutch citizens.
''You don't have it in daily life -- Dutch students do not report problems in living in Belgian towns,'' Mr. Melis said. ''It's only in public debates and in papers and questions to the minister.''
Kris Van Dijck, a member of the Flemish Parliament on the education committee, called for a sense of proportion.
''The price of education in Flanders is very good -- it's cheaper than buying an iPad,'' Mr. Van Dijck said in a telephone interview. ''I don't want to have an educational system only for our own students, but we also have to be aware that when we put a lot of money into our educational system, the profits from the education sometimes go abroad.''
Data from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, indicates that about 5 percent or 6 percent of European students now migrate for higher education.
Paradoxically, last year it was the Dutch Parliament that sounded the alarm when it was suggested that it was hosting too many German students at the expense of Dutch taxpayers. Germans make up about 45 percent of the 52,000 foreigners who study in the Netherlands each year, and the cost to Dutch taxpayers is estimated to be &#x20ac;6,000 per student. The overall cost, they calculated, is about &#x20ac;100 million a year, and many students are leaving the Netherlands immediately upon graduation.
A study released in April by the Dutch Ministry of Higher Education mollified some of these concerns. About 19 percent of foreign students remain in the Netherlands upon graduation, contributing far more to the Dutch economy than they take, the study found.
''It turned out that if you could keep just some of the students and bind them to your labor market permanently, then it would be an overall economic benefit to your society,'' said Robin van IJperen, project leader on internationalization at the Dutch Ministry for Education, Culture and Science in The Hague. ''They found that even if just 3 percent of the students stay after they graduate, there's a break-even point. You've earned back everything you've spent.''
Mr. van IJperen will be taking the results with him to Berlin for Bologna Process meeting in December.
''I think it's going to reframe the whole discussion,'' he said. ''If it's still a bit negative we can look into how we can make it more sustainable that people with the best and cheapest systems shouldn't be bearing the greater part of the costs.''
Given this new data, Mr. van IJperen was surprised about the concern that too many Dutch students might be migrating to Flanders. ''The message to Belgium will be: If you can keep them, you shouldn't complain. You should be happy.''

HEADLINE: Leadership University Rises for Asian Women

BYLINE: By KELLY WETHERILLE

 BODY:
When the Asian University for Women in Bangladesh opened in 2008, it set in motion the idea that the region would benefit from a high-profile university dedicated to young women.
Now, veterans of the A.U.W. have altered the concept to lay the foundations for another Asian women's university that, by conservative estimates, is expected to open in Malaysia in 2015.
The concept of an Asian Women's Leadership University, a private nonprofit institution, was conceived in 2010 by Barbara Hou, who had previously served as legal council and director of admissions at A.U.W. in Bangladesh. 
''I learned a lot from that experience about the desire for this type of institution in the region,'' Ms. Hou said of her time at the A.U.W. ''And many of us realized that if we could expand the idea of a women's liberal arts college beyond Bangladesh, and make it pan-Asian and located in a more developed but affordable country -- well, we thought that'd be pretty awesome.''
She enlisted six like-minded individuals to form a board of founding members for the Malaysia project.
Henry Lau, one of those founding members and a corporate lawyer in Tokyo, convinced his firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, to support the project on a pro bono basis. The firm was instrumental in registering the A.W.L.U. as a nonprofit organization in the United States.
''Once they signed on, we got more credibility and we got more support,'' Mr. Lau said. ''If there's no organization, then it's hard to raise money; it's hard to conduct activities legally. You can't even enter into contracts.''
Mr. Lau described the process of securing outside support as a ''chicken and egg issue.'' He added that having a prominent academic partner was needed for the project to gain recognition in Malaysia.
Smith College, one of the Seven Sisters of U.S. women's liberal arts colleges, has signed on as an academic planning partner. Three of the A.W.L.U. founders -- Ms. Hou, Hoon Eng Khoo and Mona Sinha -- are graduates of Smith, and Ms. Sinha sits on its board of trustees.
''There's a developing consensus among government, NGOs and business that women's leadership in public life, in the professions and in business is key to the development of emerging economies,'' said Carol Christ, president of Smith College, when asked about support for projects like the A.W.L.U. ''Over a century of experience in the United States has demonstrated the powerful role women's colleges play in educating women leaders.''
As Ms. Hou put it: ''Anyone can check the news and see that the central challenge of our time is incorporating the full talent, effectiveness and participation of women in society. A.W.L.U. is being created to meet that challenge.''
The A.W.L.U. has set up a graduate pathway partnership with the Graduate School of Medicine at Perdana University in Malaysia, which works in collaboration with Johns Hopkins's medical school in the United States.
It has also identified 100 acres, or 40 hectares, of land in Penang.
There are notable differences between the existing A.U.W. in Bangladesh and the proposed A.W.L.U. in Malaysia. The former, in a country where per capita income is only about $700, runs on charitable donations and supports women from the poorest backgrounds. The latter, planned for the relatively more affluent country of Malaysia, will serve a broad swath of society.
''We wanted something like the Eighth Sister in Asia,'' Mr. Lau said. ''In the United States these colleges are self-sustaining. The fact is you do need tuition; you do need fee-paying students. Of course the learning environment is much improved by diversity, whether racial, ethnic, religious and socioeconomic, so we definitely need to provide assistance for people of less means. And we also are definitely very committed to a liberal arts education model.''
The board envisions that the majority of students will pay full tuition, with about one-quarter of students on full scholarship.
''A lot of the challenges in Bangladesh, in the views of many, stemmed from poor governance and the significant infrastructural challenges from being located in a place without clean water and air, adequate hospitals and medical care, road safety, reliable electricity, Internet connection, etc.,'' Ms. Hou said of the A.U.W. ''Earthquakes, dengue fever, building codes and fire safety were also a concern.''
''That doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a university in Bangladesh, but just that if you wanted to set up one modeled on the U.S. Seven Sisters, you might have to think of other more appropriate locations,'' she said.
''Location turns out to be pretty key because it impacts the types of students and faculty you will be able to attract and retain,'' she added.
The A.W.L.U. board is working with the Malaysian government to iron out the specifics of the land agreement, while also waiting for a licensing decision from the Ministry of Higher Education.
It is also working to raise the $8 million in seed capital required to start a university in Malaysia. Under a conservative estimate, they expect that the A.W.L.U. will open its doors in 2015, but if fund-raising goes better than planned, they say the opening could come even sooner.

HEADLINE: University Caters to the Deprived

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
CHITTAGONG, BANGLADESH -- It is not the most glamorous of campuses: a handful of converted apartment blocks, huddled around a short, narrow gated street that ends in a small garden. Tucked away inside the buildings, there is a small library, a dining hall, a doctor's clinic, classrooms and a small gym where karate classes are held.
For the 541 students who attend the Asian University for Women, the basic and somewhat cramped facilities are home. And for many of them, the university, which opened its doors in this sprawling, bustling Bangladeshi port in 2008, represents the rare and coveted chance to get an English-language, university-level education.
Nearly all of the students come from deprived backgrounds. Their room, board and education costs -- which total about $15,000 a year -- are covered by donations. Most of the students would not be here without the funding and the university's female-only admissions policy. 
They come from a dozen countries as varied as Cambodia, Sri Lanka, China, Myanmar, India and, of course, Bangladesh, where the university is located. They practice many religions and speak 33 languages.
Soon, recruitment will be extended to three more countries -- Egypt, Malaysia and Indonesia -- for an even more diverse mix.
Stepping into the university lets a person visit ''a dozen different countries all at once,'' said Chogyel Wangmo, one of 23 students from the mountain kingdom of Bhutan. ''There are no prejudices, no assumptions.''
Ms. Wangmo, who had to walk several kilometers to submit her application, is the first woman from her village to attend a university.
''It was quite a shock to come here,'' said Bayan Hisham Salaymeh, who wears a head scarf and is a native of Hebron in the Palestinian territories. The traffic, the different language, even the spicy food was an adjustment.
''I had never been in a place with so much diversity before,'' said Ms. Salaymeh, 21.
Many of the students had never been abroad before they came to this university. Many had limited English and computer skills and were given a year of preparatory training before starting their formal undergraduate studies.
All of them were selected for being dynamic and determined, and for their dedication to making their education count.
''We look for the gleam in their eyes,'' said Kamal Ahmad, the university's founder. ''We look for courage, a sense of outrage at injustice, and empathy -- a sense that they are moved by the woes of other people.''
Born in Bangladesh and educated in the United States, Mr. Ahmad worked for many years in development organizations and as a lawyer in the United States and Britain. A passionate believer in education, he arranged basic schooling for children in the slums in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka when he was a teenager.
Mr. Ahmad said that educating young women could play a critical role in Asia, where, despite progress in some countries, gender discrimination and stereotyping are still rife.
Mr. Ahmad's decision to set up a university for women was, in part, a deliberate attempt to help redress some of the gender imbalances in tertiary education. It also builds on the fact that women tend to deploy their skills, income or education to support their families and communities -- and that educating and empowering young women, in particular, is thus likely to benefit their societies as a whole, Mr. Ahmad said.
Taslima Khanam, who attends the Asian University for Women and is from Chittagong, is studying public health with the goal of helping the government of Bangladesh combat medical issues.
Sumpa Sarkar, also from Bangladesh, plans to get a doctorate in politics and become a professor. ''I want to share my knowledge with other people,'' she said by telephone from the French city of Reims, where she and Ms. Khanam are on a one-year exchange program at the prestigious Institut d'Études Politiques.
There are also young women like Mowmita Basak Mow, a native of Chittagong, who, like so many of the women here, exudes confidence and enthusiasm that is likely to help her go far.
Kubra Panahzada is one of 40 students from Afghanistan, who, before she came to Chittagong, set herself up as a liaison between nongovernmental groups and companies offering spare parts and other supplies.
''A friend of mine in Kabul is a businessman -- and I thought, if he can do this, why not me?'' she said.
''I want to help others as well as myself,'' Ms. Panahzada, 24, added. ''I am the future of my country.''
Mr. Ahmad said that the Asian University for Women was not only about academic training and exposing students to other cultures and religions, but it is also about giving hundreds of young women the confidence to challenge established assumptions about themselves and others.
Meherun Ahmed, who teaches social sciences at the university, said that the young women were often timid and inhibited when they arrived; some were even depressed. For many, being encouraged to think independently and critically, rather than learning by rote, is new and takes time and adjustment.
''But there's a real fighting spirit,'' Ms. Ahmed said. ''If you look at them now, you wouldn't believe the difficulties they had.''
The Asian University for Women has received financial backing and other high-profile support from around the world. Its chancellor, for example, is Cherie Blair, the wife of Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. Mrs. Blair is an international human rights lawyer and campaigner for women's equality.
On the financial front, donations of about $50 million have come from individual donors and organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the U.S. State Department. In May, the IKEA Foundation committed $5 million to sponsoring 100 students for five years.
The Bangladeshi government, whose female foreign minister, Dipu Moni, is a trustee of the university, has made available a large plot of land on the outskirts of Chittagong.
There, a new campus is slowly emerging from the rugged terrain, with the help of a work force that includes women as well as men.
Once the new complex is finished, there will be room for 3,000 students. But the going is slow, and the funding is hard to obtain, so completion remains a long way off. Until then, the lack of space in the existing campus is a major hurdle to expansion.
A milestone for the fledgling outfit, meanwhile, comes next May, when the first group of students -- 138 in all -- graduates.
There are dreams of jobs with international companies, of postgraduate degrees, of setting up businesses and nongovernmental organizations, and of promoting women's education back home.
Among the expected 2013 graduates is Nazneen, 26. Already, her studies have taken her from her home in the Hunza Valley, in the mountainous far north of Pakistan, to Stanford University, where she took part in a summer academic program last year. Nazneen, who uses only one name, is majoring in politics, philosophy and economics and has also done an internship at the World Bank. Her next goal is to get a master's degree.
As for Ms. Salaymeh, the student from Hebron, she has embraced the diversity that shocked her when she arrived. The conflict in and around the Palestinian territories, she said, is ''suffocating'' -- and she is determined to help change that once she returns, by helping people become more aware of the world outside.
''I can't think of another place on earth,'' she said, ''that needs my help as much as my home country.''

HEADLINE: Fighting Fiscal Phantoms

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
These are difficult times for the deficit scolds who have dominated policy discussion for almost three years. One could almost feel sorry for them, if it weren't for their role in diverting attention from the ongoing problem of inadequate recovery, and thereby helping to perpetuate catastrophically high unemployment.
What has changed? For one thing, the crisis they predicted keeps not happening. Far from fleeing U.S. debt, investors have continued to pile in, driving interest rates to historical lows. Beyond that, suddenly the clear and present danger to the American economy isn't that we'll fail to reduce the deficit enough; it is, instead, that we'll reduce the deficit too much. For that's what the ''fiscal cliff'' -- better described as the austerity bomb -- is all about: the tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to kick in at the end of this year are precisely not what we want to see happen in a still-depressed economy. 
Given these realities, the deficit-scold movement has lost some of its clout. That movement, by the way, is a hydra-headed beast, comprising many organizations that turn out, on inspection, to be financed and run by more or less the same people; dig down into many of these groups' back stories and you will, in particular, find Peter Peterson, the private-equity billionaire, playing a key role.
But the deficit scolds aren't giving up. Now yet another organization, Fix the Debt, is campaigning for cuts to Social Security and Medicare, even while making lower tax rates a ''core principle.'' That last part makes no sense in terms of the group's ostensible mission, but makes perfect sense if you look at the array of big corporations, from Goldman Sachs to the UnitedHealth Group, that are involved in the effort and would benefit from tax cuts. Hey, sacrifice is for the little people.
So should we take this latest push seriously? No -- and not just because these people, aside from exhibiting a lot of hypocrisy, have been wrong about everything so far. The truth is that at a fundamental level the crisis story they're trying to sell doesn't make sense.
You've heard the story many times: Supposedly, any day now investors will lose faith in America's ability to come to grips with its budget failures. When they do, there will be a run on Treasury bonds, interest rates will spike, and the U.S. economy will plunge back into recession.
This sounds plausible to many people, because it's roughly speaking what happened to Greece. But we're not Greece, and it's almost impossible to see how this could actually happen to a country in our situation.
For we have our own currency -- and almost all of our debt, both private and public, is denominated in dollars. So our government, unlike the Greek government, literally can't run out of money. After all, it can print the stuff. So there's almost no risk that America will default on its debt -- I'd say no risk at all if it weren't for the possibility that Republicans would once again try to hold the nation hostage over the debt ceiling.
But if the U.S. government prints money to pay its bills, won't that lead to inflation? No, not if the economy is still depressed.
Now, it's true that investors might start to expect higher inflation some years down the road. They might also push down the value of the dollar. Both of these things, however, would actually help rather than hurt the U.S. economy right now: expected inflation would discourage corporations and families from sitting on cash, while a weaker dollar would make our exports more competitive.
Still, haven't crises like the one envisioned by deficit scolds happened in the past? Actually, no. As far as I can tell, every example supposedly illustrating the dangers of debt involves either a country that, like Greece today, lacked its own currency, or a country that, like Asian economies in the 1990s, had large debts in foreign currencies. Countries with large debts in their own currency, like France after World War I, have sometimes experienced big loss-of-confidence drops in the value of their currency -- but nothing like the debt-induced recession we're being told to fear.
So let's step back for a minute, and consider what's going on here. For years, deficit scolds have held Washington in thrall with warnings of an imminent debt crisis, even though investors, who continue to buy U.S. bonds, clearly believe that such a crisis won't happen; economic analysis says that such a crisis can't happen; and the historical record shows no examples bearing any resemblance to our current situation in which such a crisis actually did happen.
If you ask me, it's time for Washington to stop worrying about this phantom menace -- and to stop listening to the people who have been peddling this scare story in an attempt to get their way.

HEADLINE: Trying to Turn Obama Voters Into Allies in Tax Fight

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Tea Party activists swamped town hall-style meetings about health care in the summer of 2009, President Obama's army of campaign volunteers largely stayed away, seemingly less interested in fighting for legislation than they had been in electing the nation's first African-American president.
Now, Mr. Obama is seizing a second chance to keep his election-year supporters animated.
With lawmakers scheduled to return to work on Monday to begin intense discussions before a looming fiscal deadline, Mr. Obama's aides are trying to harness the passions that returned him to the White House, hoping to pressure Republicans in Congress to accept tax increases on the wealthy. The president's strategists are turning first to the millions of e-mail addresses assembled by the campaign and the White House. 
Already, supporters are being asked to record YouTube videos of themselves talking about the importance of raising taxes on the rich. Aides said those videos would be shared on Facebook and Twitter and would be forwarded to centrist Democrats, as well as to mainstream Republicans, who they hope will break with their Tea Party colleagues.
An e-mail last week urged activists to share with their friends a graphic explaining the president's tax argument. And Mr. Obama's campaign manager sent an e-mail appeal asking supporters to fill out a survey about issues they would like to stay involved in.
The president is planning rallies in influential states to remind supporters of the need to keep the pressure on lawmakers during the fiscal talks. And should negotiations break down, Mr. Obama's team is arranging for Republican lawmakers to hear from of tens of thousands of riled-up activists through angry Twitter posts, e-mails and Facebook messages.
''If Republicans refuse to move, if they refuse to cooperate, then you've got to be willing to engage the American public,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat and important Obama ally. The campaign machinery, he said, ''will respond to the president calling upon it to get engaged.''
As Mr. Obama tries to motivate his army of supporters, his rivals will be working to do the same. Republicans have acknowledged that they did not match Mr. Obama's campaign operation, but in the tax fight, the party and its allies will also be using technology.
The Republican National Committee has turned to Twitter regularly to talk about the impact of tax increases on small businesses, using the hashtag #StopTheTaxHike. And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has begun a multimedia campaign that it says is intended to prevent a financial disaster if Congress and the president do not reach an agreement.
The chamber's site has a ''Fiscal Cliff Countdown'' clock, a calculator to determine ''your post-taxmageddon taxes'' and links to e-mail members of Congress.
Republicans in Congress will not have access to the kind of national list that Mr. Obama does. And yet it is not certain that Mr. Obama and his allies will be any more successful in motivating his followers than they were during the postelection period four years ago.
The fiscal negotiations are taking place behind closed doors, and to reach a deal with Speaker John A. Boehner, Mr. Obama will probably have to make compromises that could undermine the fervor of his most ardent supporters.
''The big issue they are going to have to figure out with the list is that activists want to fight for issues they can believe in,'' said Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Protect Your Care, a liberal advocacy group. ''A call to cut a bipartisan deal -- that's not going to cut it.''
At the same time, the White House needs to avoid overplaying its hand and antagonizing Republicans to the point where a deal becomes impossible.
Obama aides view keeping their grass-roots supporters energized as important to the president's second-term success on broader tax changes, an immigration overhaul and efforts on climate change.
In his first term, Mr. Obama's yearlong battle over health care failed to inspire the millions of activists from his 2008 campaign to put pressure on Republican lawmakers.''We were stunned that it never showed up,'' said a senior member of a pro-health-overhaul interest group, who asked for anonymity to avoid angering the White House. ''They had this thing built, and we were waiting for them to turn it on, and it just never came.''
Later on, Mr. Obama's team did more to rally pressure on his adversaries. The president succeeded in fights with Republicans to extend the payroll tax cut in 2011 and to change student loans.
''There's always a challenge between rallying cry issues and the challenge of governing,'' said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group. ''It's one that I'm confident he can navigate.''
The first test of the mobilization efforts will come quickly, as the president pushes the tax issue during the lame-duck session of Congress. The idea, aides say, is to marry old-fashioned phone calls to the offices of wavering lawmakers with the latest social media tools.
Unions and progressive groups have made a Web site, theaction.org, calling for an end to ''the Bush tax cuts for the richest two percent.'' Supporters are encouraged to download an ''action kit'' that includes materials needed to make signs, letterheads and Web site banner ads -- all arguing for an end to the tax cuts.
One sign that can be printed out says ''Middle Class Over Millionaires.'' Another says ''Fairness & Progress from Congress.'' A typical banner advertisement that supporters can download and post on their Web site says ''End the Bush Tax Cuts for the Wealthy.''
Visitors to the site are also given the option of expressing their support for Mr. Obama with a single click that creates a Twitter message: ''The election is over. Don't rest. Join the action. The action to end the Bush tax cuts for the rich. #theaction.''
Another button on the site takes visitors to a Facebook page that can be used to organize meet-ups for the tax fight.
''People just spent five years winning two presidential elections together,'' Jim Messina, the president's campaign manager, told Politico last week in his first extended interview since the election. ''They're now not going to walk away and not help him become the change that they want to see.''
In the survey e-mail that came from Mr. Messina shortly after the election, supporters were asked to identify issues they would be willing to volunteer on, including the economy, education, immigration, jobs and trade, tax fairness, urban community issues and climate change.
Among the questions on the survey: Would supporters like to continue to volunteer in their community as part of an Obama organization? And if so, the survey asked, how many hours a week could they work?
''They built these tools,'' Mr. Messina said. ''They're the people that know how to do them. And I think what they want to use them on now is to continue to help the president advocate for his agenda.''
The president himself has vowed to take the lead by continuing a campaign-like presence in communities across the country as he battles for the tax increases on the wealthy and what he calls a ''balanced'' approach to spending cuts and deficit reduction.
If Mr. Obama succeeds in the fight over the tax cuts because of help from energized activists, his advisers hope the victory will embolden those supporters even more.
''Success begets success,'' Ms. Tanden said. ''If they are able to take this argument and mobilize them on the fiscal cliff, then I believe he will have success on immigration reform and future issues.''

HEADLINE: Early Push For Sales Undercuts Black Friday

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD; Rebecca Fairley Rainey, Christina Capecchi and Christopher Maag contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After spending years to make Black Friday into the year's blockbuster shopping day, retailers undercut themselves last week.
Sales on the day after Thanksgiving fell from those a year earlier, according to one major tracker, the first decline since the recession of 2008, as stores started their ''doorbuster'' promotions early in the week and opened for business on Thursday evening.
The culprit seems to be less a faltering economy and more a diffusion of holiday shopping to other days and online. 
Black Friday ''is certainly not dead,'' said Matthew Shay, chief executive of the National Retail Federation trade group, but ''it's starting to spread out.''
For major retailers, Black Friday's role appears to be changing. This year, stores like Target, Sears and Toys ''R'' Us opened on Thanksgiving evening, while Walmart started its first doorbuster deals at 8 p.m., drawing shoppers to stores earlier than ever and lessening Friday's appeal.
While store visits on the Friday after Thanksgiving rose 3.5 percent from last year, to more than 307 million visits, retail sales decreased 1.8 percent, according to the research firm ShopperTrak.
On Thanksgiving, meanwhile, there was almost a 21 percent increase in the number of people making visits to stores or Web sites in the United States, according to the National Retail Federation.
''The early promotions and early openings on Thursday drew some of the sales that would normally land on Friday into Thursday,'' said Bill Martin, founder of ShopperTrak. ''What we're going to start looking at is the 'Black Weekend,' a four-day weekend.''
About 28 percent of people surveyed by the federation who said they were shopping over the weekend started at midnight or earlier on Thanksgiving. In 2009, when major retailers started experimenting with Thanksgiving openings, that figure was just 3 percent.
''You want to be open if they want to go shopping,'' said Laura Gurski, a partner and global head of A.T. Kearney's retail practice. But as a result, ''the kickoff of the holiday season is being redefined.''
One clear winner for the weekend was online shopping. Sales increased 17.4 percent on Thanksgiving, and 20.7 percent the next day, according to I.B.M., which tracks e-commerce transactions from 500 retailers.
And consumers who were shopping this weekend said that about 40 percent of their dollars were spent online, according to the retail federation's survey.
The ShopperTrak data showing that visits were up but sales were down on Friday suggested that many people were buying online instead, Ms. Gurski said.
''It's more a social event to go out shopping on that Friday than where you make your actual purchases,'' she said, adding that it also depended ''on how enticing the online offer is.''
Over the Thanksgiving weekend, the retail federation said, shoppers increased their average spending to $423, from $398 in the period a year earlier.
''Now we're seeing, really, a five-day weekend that starts Thursday and will end tomorrow,'' said Mr. Shay of the federation, referring to Monday.
But there are also signs that shoppers are getting weary of the extension of special shopping days, with Thanksgiving now added to a packed schedule of Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, Cyber Monday, Mobile Tuesday and on and on.
The federation predicted after a survey this month that 147 million people would shop over the Black Friday weekend, but only 137 million people turned out, according to the group's latest polling. Still, turnout was up 4.6 percent from last year.
Though retail researchers and consultants say Thanksgiving openings will probably become more commonplace, some shoppers objected to them.
''I don't like it,'' said Denny Johnson, 66, a retired property manager from Burnsville, Minn., who had come to the Sam's Club in Eagan, Minn., on Friday for a 51-inch Samsung television. ''They're going to start this on Veterans Day if they keep going.''
Archie Weatherspoon IV, 29, a probation officer from St. Paul, had come with his wife and two young boys, who munched on McDonald's hash browns as they awaited a ticket for a Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone. Mr. Weatherspoon had almost called off the plan for the family's first Black Friday outing after watching a YouTube video of a Thursday night cellphone fight at an out-of-state Walmart. ''I don't want to bring my kids out if it's going to be that chaotic,'' he said.
In Upland, Calif., on Friday morning, Toby Taylor, 46, was resting on a bench on a quiet street of small businesses. He said he was not at the mall because ''it's too crowded. I don't know if the savings are worth those crowds.''
Stores being open on Thanksgiving ''bothers me,'' said Veronica Lynagh, of Columbus, Ohio. ''Last year, I got upset because I had 25 people here for Thanksgiving dinner, and at 8 p.m. the whole family left to wait in line at Best Buy. I thought it was ridiculous. Why would you leave your family to go stand in line and buy things?''
Yet Mr. Shay said that Thanksgiving falls when it does in part because of the efforts of the retailer Fred R. Lazarus Jr., head of Federated Department Stores. He lobbied President Franklin D. Roosevelt to move Thanksgiving up a week -- and thus extend the holiday shopping season.

HEADLINE: Pete La Roca Sims, Jazz Drummer With Swing, Dies at 74

BYLINE: By NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
Pete La Roca Sims, a powerful and distinctive drummer who created the pulse for some of jazz's leading figures from the late 1950s through the '60s, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 74.
The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter, Susan Sims.
With an effervescent time feel and an alert style that could turn an accompanying role into a running commentary, Mr. Sims was well-suited to the dynamism of the postbop era. 
''He was for me very, very easy to play with,'' the pianist Steve Kuhn, a regular collaborator in the early 1960s, said last week. ''His influences were what they were, but he synthesized them. His conception was unique.''
Working as Pete La Roca, Mr. Sims appeared on a handful of classic albums of the period, notably by the tenor saxophonists Sonny Rollins and Joe Henderson. ''Basra,'' an album he made for Blue Note in 1965, leading a quartet with Mr. Henderson, Mr. Kuhn and the bassist Steve Swallow, is itself widely regarded as a classic.
Mr. Sims also recorded memorably with the alto saxophonist Jackie McLean, the trumpeter Art Farmer, the pianist Paul Bley and others. His second album as a leader, ''Turkish Women at the Bath,'' released in 1967, featured John Gilmore of the Sun Ra Arkestra on tenor saxophone and Chick Corea on piano.
Peter Sims was born on April 7, 1938, in Manhattan. He grew up in Harlem, surrounded by jazz: his stepfather was a trumpeter, and his uncle managed a suite of rehearsal studios. Mr. Sims had his first professional experience as a timbale player on the Latin dance-band circuit, where he adopted his stage surname, La Roca (''the Rock'').
He transitioned to the drum kit at 17. Two years later, on the recommendation of the pioneering bebop drummer Max Roach, he played what he would later recall as his first jazz engagement, with Mr. Rollins. Part of that performance would be immortalized on Mr. Rollins's ''Night at the Village Vanguard,'' one of the bedrock live albums in jazz, though the drummer on most of the tracks is Elvin Jones.
During the spring and summer of 1960, Mr. Sims worked in an early iteration of the John Coltrane Quartet. He was similarly a short-lived founding member of Stan Getz's acclaimed early-'60s quartet. (His replacement in the Coltrane band was Mr. Jones; in the Getz ensemble, it was Roy Haynes.)
Though he brushed up against experimentalism, free jazz held little appeal for Mr. Sims, and jazz-rock even less. This, combined with his growing impatience with sideman work, gradually resulted in dwindling opportunities. He drove a taxi for five years while studying law at New York University, and then became a contract lawyer. (When ''Turkish Women at the Bath'' was reissued without permission under Mr. Corea's name, as ''Bliss!,'' he successfully sued.)
Mr. Sims bristled at the widely held perception that he had abandoned music to become a lawyer. The truth, he said, was that he would have continued to work as a musician if there had been more opportunities to play the kind of music he wanted to play -- and that as soon as it became economically feasible to balance his music and law careers, he resumed performing.
He began playing semi-regularly again in 1979, using his real last name and mentoring younger musicians, notably the saxophonist David Liebman. And he doubled down on his stubborn adherence to swing rhythm. The name of his working band was Swingtime; that was also the title of his final album, released on Blue Note in 1997.
Mr. Sims's marriage to the former Margo Burroughs ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, a blues singer and drummer, Mr. Sims is survived by his son, Kenneth Harvey, and his brother, Michael Morgan.

8 P.M. (13) ROD STEWART: MERRY CHRISTMAS, BABY In this holiday special, taped in September at the Villa de Leon in Pacific Palisades, Calif., and presented by ''Great Performances,'' Mr. Stewart, above, sings classics like ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,'' ''Silent Night'' and ''Auld Lang Syne.'' He performs duets with Michael Bublé (''Winter Wonderland''), Cee Lo Green (''Merry Christmas Baby''), Mary J. Blige (''We Three Kings'') and a virtual Ella Fitzgerald (''What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?''). He'll also do an original song, ''Red-Suited Super Man,'' from his new holiday album. 
9:10 A.M. (HBO) THE CHANGE-UP (2011) Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman), a corporate lawyer and father of three, finds his body switched with that of his bachelor best friend, Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds), an unemployed actor, after they urinate side by side into a public fountain while declaring that they'd like to live each other's lives. Panic ensues when they return to the fountain and discover that it has been moved. And while the premise isn't explored with any depth, it ''at least sets up a farce that surpasses 'The Hangover' in gleeful crudeness and profanity,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, adding that ''the similarities between the two movies aren't coincidental,'' for Jon Lucas and Scott Moore wrote both. In ''Horrible Bosses'' (2011), at 3 p.m. on Cinemax, three men fed up with their jobs and their lives (Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis and Mr. Bateman) plot to knock off their bosses (Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell and Jennifer Aniston) with the help of a ''murder consultant'' (Jamie Foxx) in this comedy of male resentment, directed by Seth Gordon. ''It takes the ordinary human traits of stupidity, selfishness, lust and greed (and also stupidity), embeds them in a human condition that is confusing, unfair and also stupid, and turns the whole sorry spectacle into a carnival,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''The laughter is mean but also oddly pure: It expels shame and leaves you feeling dizzy, a little embarrassed and also exhilarated, kind of like the cocaine that two of the main characters consume by accident.''
3:35 P.M. (Starz) RACHEL GETTING MARRIED (2008) Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt) may be the one getting married, but this film is mostly about her younger sister, Kym (Anne Hathaway, left), ''a bottomless repository of guilt, destructiveness and general bad feeling,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. Furloughed from rehab, Kym arrives at the rambling Connecticut clapboard house of her father (Bill Irwin). Tensions soon boil over. Debra Winger plays the mother who has never quite come to terms with Kym's past. And while this film, from Jonathan Demme, may have its faults, Mr. Scott added, it is ''so persuasively forgiving of the flaws of its inhabitants that you can only respond, in like spirit, with love.''
8 P.M. (Nickelodeon) FORGOTTEN BUT NOT GONE: KIDS, H.I.V. AND AIDS In recognition of World AIDS Day on Saturday ''Nick News With Linda Ellerbee'' talks with children who are living with or affected by the virus.
9 P.M. (ABC) EXTREME MAKEOVER: HOME EDITION In this Thanksgiving edition Ty Pennington and his team renovate the Knoxville, Tenn., home of Daniel and Mandy Watson, who through their nonprofit organization, Restoration House, offer housing and mentors to low-income single mothers. Jenny McCarthy guest stars as the team leader.
10 P.M. (Lifetime) LOVE AT THE CHRISTMAS TABLE (2012) After spending each Christmas Eve since childhood seated with his friend Kat (Danica McKellar) at the children's table, the 30-year-old Sam (Dustin Milligan) now realizes that she is the woman for him -- if the past doesn't get in the way.
1 A.M. (Oxygen) I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE (2007) Chris Rock plays an investment banker who seems to have it all: a beautiful wife (Gina Torres), two adorable children, a lovely house in the suburbs and a good job with a high-end Manhattan firm. But he's bored. Then along comes Nikki (Kerry Washington), and with her, trouble. Mr. Rock directed this film and wrote the script, which he adapted with Louis C. K. from Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon.'' Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott said, ''In attempting to synthesize the later French New Wave of the late 1960s and early '70s with the upscale African-American romantic comedies that flourished in Hollywood in the late 1990s, Mr. Rock has not only done his best work as a director and screenwriter but has also made an unusually insightful and funny mainstream American movie about the predicaments of modern marriage.''

HEADLINE: An Age of Irony? Yes. No. Whatever.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I earnestly read and sincerely appreciated Christy Wampole's essay ''How to Live Without Irony'' (Sunday Review, Nov. 18). Afterward I set forth to cultivate this unironic and less cynical attitude in my own life.
A few hours later, exhausted and humorless, I wondered if perhaps we live in an ironic age because there is such a lot of absurdity to daily living. I wonder, too, if a measure of irony and a little (not too much) cynicism might even be a healthy response to this absurdity. 
Maybe a better goal would be to moderate irony, but not to banish it.
Then again, maybe a few hours was not a long-enough trial.
BARBARA YOST WILLIAMS Madison, Wis., Nov. 18, 2012
To the Editor:
Christy Wampole provides a well-reasoned analysis of why a life lived ironically is a life devoid of value. But in calling ironic living ''the ethos of our age,'' she overestimates its prevalence.
The acute self-consciousness that leads to an ironic shell usually dissipates after early adulthood. Even within that age group, many people do not adopt irony as their primary means of relating to the world. The challenge of establishing a career in an unfriendly economy does not afford such a luxury.
DAVID ALTMAN Glen Rock, N.J., Nov. 18, 2012
To the Editor:
Christy Wampole has given voice to one of my gravest concerns as a middle-school English teacher. In a city that is defined by irony, how do I teach my students not only to value but also to seek out and celebrate sincerity?
My units of study are not ironic. A Holocaust memoir is not funny. Post-colonial literature does not have a snarky punch line.
In fact, I purposefully avoid any detailed study of irony in literature because I worry that my students are already bombarded by disingenuousness outside the classroom. I agree with Ms. Wampole that the cause of much of this irony is our collective addiction to technology.
Irony is born of our discomfort with genuinely connecting with one another. We now rely on an intermediary in the form of technology to communicate our ideas.
But at what cost? We gain speed, instant gratification and ease. But we lose meaning, kindness and depth of feeling: traits that I hope to teach my students to treasure. Traits that I hope they will fight for.
JONATHAN PELEGANO Astoria, Queens, Nov. 18, 2012
To the Editor:
Each of us has an obligation to wax nostalgic about the era of our youth and to bemoan the state of young people today. I get it. But Christy Wampole, where do you live that the only people you interact with under 30 are so odiously disengaged and uninterested? Hipsters even!
As a 28-year-old Manhattanite, I can attest that most of my friends work really hard, save and plan for the future, and, yes, even care deeply about the world around us. In the days after Hurricane Sandy, almost all my friends -- totally nonironically -- volunteered to help those in need. I am still deeply moved by the two college students who showed up from Connecticut to help my great-uncle clean out his flooded home in the Rockaways.
So please, cut us some slack.
RACHEL TRAVIS New York, Nov. 18, 2012
To the Editor:
The writer's view on how our current culture uses irony is out of date. Being earnest is the new trend. Millennial voter turnout this year set records. The popular thing now is to be ''true.''
Popular bands like Title Fight, Converge and Defeater ooze sincerity in their lyrics. Every song is about heartache, personal improvement or frustration with the world.
If anything, the hallmark for our current youth culture is being too serious. There's no place for looking at yourself and laughing.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks and Savings Play Role in Budget Talks

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
Every year, the government spends more than $100 billion on tax breaks to encourage Americans to save more for retirement. But a new study suggests such provisions may have little effect on the amount Americans save.
The finding has particular relevance as Congress looks for ways to raise revenue by reducing tax breaks as part of the year-end budget negotiations.
The researchers - Raj Chetty and John N. Friedman of Harvard, Soren Leth-Petersen and Tore Olsen of the University of Copenhagen, and Torben Heien Nielsen of the Danish National Center for Social Research - looked at Danish data, in part because analogous American numbers are much less detailed. Although there is no way to know whether the patterns in Denmark and the United States are identical, the two countries have similar pension systems, and the new research fits with previous findings about how Americans save. 
The researchers found that every dollar that the Danish government spent on tax breaks increased total savings by about only one cent. In contrast, policies that automatically saved a portion of a worker's income increased total savings by a substantial amount.
William G. Gale, a tax expert at the Brookings Institution, said the new research was remarkable. Automatic savings systems, Mr. Gale said, "have proven remarkably effective in raising 401(k) participation rates and to some extent contribution rates, if done right." But it has not been clear whether people offset those increases by saving less elsewhere, he added.
Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia Business School and a top Republican economist, said in an e-mail about the new research that he believed low taxes on savings still benefited the economy over the long term. But, he said, saving incentives may be less powerful for the less well-off.
President Obama and Congressional leaders recently started talks to prevent hundreds of billions of dollars of tax increases and spending cuts from taking effect in January. Leaders of both parties say they want to enact policies that would do less damage to the economy in the short term while still reducing the deficit. But their plans differ.
Mr. Obama has said he wants to increase tax revenue by about $1.6 trillion over 10 years, with all new revenue coming from taxes on high-income households. Republicans leaders have signaled that they prefer closer to $800 billion in additional tax revenue, all of it coming from the reduction of tax breaks and faster economic growth, rather than higher tax rates.
The tax breaks for retirement savings are among the largest tax expenditures, along with those for employer-provided health insurance and mortgage interest. About 80 percent of retirement-savings benefits flow to households in the top fifth of earners - those making at least $100,000 - according to the Tax Policy Center in Washington.
In studying the tax data, the Danish and American researchers identified two main types of savers. About 85 percent of Danes were "passive" savers, who tended to be less responsive to government policies and less wealthy. The remaining 15 percent were "active" savers, who were more responsive and richer.
When the government reduced a tax break for retirement savings, passive savers barely changed their behavior. By contrast, automatic savings programs had more impact on them, causing the passive savers to put away more money for retirement, said Mr. Chetty, who recently won a so-called genius grant from the MacArthur Foundation.
Active savers also responded to tax breaks that change - but by shifting money between accounts that come with tax advantages and other accounts, not by changing the amount they put away. The automatic savings programs also had little effect on active savers' overall balances.
The researchers, who have been presenting their findings at academic seminars, said they planned to submit the paper to an academic journal this week.
The researchers conclude that tax breaks do not increase the overall level of savings by much, and do not tend to change the behavior of most workers - particularly the less wealthy, who often need the most help in preparing for retirement.
"The findings reported here call into question whether subsidies are the best policy tool to increase retirement savings," the authors write. "Our findings strengthen recent arguments for using 'nudges' such as automatic payroll deductions or savings defaults to stimulate retirement savings instead of subsidies."
In a typical default program, an employer or government agency automatically directs a portion of workers' earnings to a savings account, although the employees have the option of increasing or decreasing the amount. Most American employers lack a default program, and workers who take no action save nothing.
The biggest question concerning the new study about Denmark is why it deserves attention when dozens of prominent researchers have written hundreds of papers on retirement saving programs and subsidies in this country.
The researchers argue that the answer is in the data. The Danish government keeps much more detailed numbers on retirement accounts and savings patterns. So while there has never been a conclusive answer to the question of whether Washington's tax breaks on retirement savings raise the overall level of saving, the researchers believe they have found the answer in Denmark.
Ultimately, for Washington, the policy implications could be considerable.
The year-end debt talks between Congressional leaders and the White House have the potential to start a larger effort to overhaul the tax code next year, and the $1 trillion a year in breaks in the tax code are expected to come under scrutiny.
The money that the government spends to encourage Americans to save for retirement is money that cannot be spent on deficit reduction, education, health care or other priorities. The study suggests that the money has little effect on the retirement security of lower-income families, either.
On top of that, economists and policy experts have warned about a crisis in retirement security because of the decline in defined-benefit pensions, significant fiscal problems in public retirement programs, the ravages of the recession and the housing bust.
Low-cost policy changes, like requiring employers to put a portion of workers' paychecks into a retirement fund, might help millions of households save for a secure retirement without driving Washington deeper into the red.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Republican and Lesbian, and Fighting for Acceptance of Both Identities

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
In 1996, Kathryn Lehman was a soon-to-be married lawyer working for Republicans in the House of Representatives. One of her major accomplishments: helping to write the law that bans federal recognition of same-sex marriages.
Today, Ms. Lehman, 53, no longer has a husband, and no longer identifies as straight. And she is a lobbyist for Freedom to Marry, which is devoted to overturning the very law she helped write, the Defense of Marriage Act.
But Ms. Lehman is still a fervent Republican.
''I'm trying to break the stereotype that all gays and lesbians, especially lesbians, are Democrats,'' she said. 
Although the Republican Party has long drawn gay men who believe in the party's message of small government and a strong military, Republican lesbians are a rare political breed.
''Oh, we're like unicorns,'' said Erin Simpson, 51, who cites ''personal liberty'' as a fundamental value and teaches firearms safety in Tucson. Ms. Simpson, who came out in February, was ''very disheartened'' by Mitt Romney's loss -- one fueled, in part, by overwhelming gay support for President Obama.
There is no way to measure the true numbers, but gay activists say that in many cases, these ''unicorns'' were Republicans before they were gay -- driven by conservative upbringings, economic issues and libertarian principles. They often did not acknowledge their sexual orientation, even to themselves, until middle age.
In interviews, these Republicans said they often feel like the odd women out, in their party and among other lesbians. But they are beginning to make their presence known, said Casey Pick, a program director and the first woman on the staff of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay-rights group.
''There is a presence of mature, established Republican women who are being more vocal of late,'' Ms. Pick said.
These women fear that they are losing the younger generations, who are coming out earlier and are even more likely to identify with the Democratic Party now that Mr. Obama has embraced gay marriage.
The election results, including victories for advocates of same-sex marriage on ballot measures in four states, offer ammunition for Ms. Lehman when she talks to Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Ms. Lehman said last week that some conservatives had already begun saying to her: ''You know, it's not really worth pursuing a federal marriage amendment. This really should be left to the states.''
''That is the more consistent conservative position,'' she added.
Ms. Lehman said she felt no guilt over her role in the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage. Her motivation, she said, is her gratitude for those who fought for gay rights decades before she knew the cause was her own.
If it were not for them, ''I would not be living the wonderful life that I am right now with Julie,'' Ms. Lehman said, referring to her partner, Julie Conway, a Republican fund-raiser, with whom she lives in Alexandria, Va.
''I am uniquely suited to do this, so I really need to do it,'' she said.
The phenomenon of coming out later in life is not unique to conservatives, but it is more common among women, said Lisa M. Diamond, a professor of psychology at the University of Utah who studies identity and sexual orientation.
''Women are generally socialized to not spend a lot of time thinking about their sexual desires,'' Professor Diamond said.
Republican lesbians rejected suggestions that they might have come out earlier if they held more liberal views. In Professor Diamond's research, the delay usually has more to do with family and religion than ideology.
Cathy Smith's upbringing was ''not rigidly Catholic,'' but when she came out in 2010, she said, her mother told her that ''she loved me, but she didn't want me to lose my soul.''
Ms. Smith, a 53-year-old teacher in North Carolina, said that despite signs that she was attracted to women, she was ''clueless'' in her youth.
''I always wanted to find a husband because my mother felt that women should be married,'' Ms. Smith said.
At 18, she registered as a Republican, and though she briefly reconsidered her party affiliation when she came out, Ms. Smith voted for Mr. Romney, albeit reluctantly. Echoing the more than a dozen women interviewed, Ms. Smith said liberal lesbians react more negatively to her political views than conservatives do to her sexual orientation.
''Mention that you're Christian or mention that you're Republican and suddenly you just get vilified,'' she said. ''That may be one of the reasons for the lack of visibility of gay women in the Republican Party.''
Still, she said, ''What good are gay rights if your country is falling apart?''
Like many Republican women who have followed her path, Ms. Smith is ''still divided in the mind about whether or not gay people should be allowed to marry,'' she said, though she supports civil unions.
Younger conservatives increasingly back same-sex marriage. A poll in May by The Washington Post and ABC News found that half of Republicans between the ages of 18 and 44 think it should be legal, compared with a quarter of those over 45.
This shift in attitude -- not to mention the election results -- led Sarah Longwell, 32, to fear that the Republican stance on gay issues could mean few younger reinforcements, even as older Republican lesbians raise their profiles.
''Now, it is increasingly hard for the Republican Party to attract younger people,'' said Ms. Longwell, the only female board member of the Log Cabin Republicans.
''One of the things that's interesting about these older people in general is that when they were coming up in the world, the Democrats were not any better,'' Ms. Longwell said. Because Democrats now support gay marriage, ''it posed a much harder question suddenly for gay Republicans.''
Lauren Yarbrough, 22, has, she said, ''been lesbian my whole life, also been in church my whole life.''
Ms. Yarbrough has been with the same woman since she was 15, but she prefers civil unions over gay marriage. She opposes abortion rights in most cases, and thinks the government should spend more on the military and less on food stamps and Medicaid. On those issues, she fits into her conservative town, LaGrange, Ga. But she keeps quiet about her sexuality, especially after being fired from a job after her boss found out.
''That's why I want to get out of this town,'' Ms. Yarbrough said. She dreams of moving to California, which she thinks would be more accepting of her sexuality, but not of her politics.
''I can't win for losing anywhere,'' she said with a sigh.

HEADLINE: Trade Deal Between U.S. and Europe Resurfaces

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- A free-trade agreement between the United States and Europe, elusive for more than a decade but with a potentially huge economic effect, is gaining momentum and may finally be attainable, business and political leaders say.
Arduous negotiations still lie ahead, but if technical hurdles can be overcome, supporters of a pact argue, it could rival the North American Free Trade Agreement in scale and be a cheap way to encourage growth between the European Union and the United States, which are already each other's biggest overseas trading partners.
''There is now, for the first time in years, a serious drive towards an E.U.-U.S. free-trade agreement,'' Karel De Gucht, the European trade commissioner, said in Dublin earlier this month.
Within days, if not hours, of President Barack Obama's re-election, numerous European leaders, including Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and David Cameron, the British prime minister, were urging Mr. Obama to push for a free-trade agreement. The Europeans hope that eliminating frictions in U.S.-E.U. trade would provide some badly needed economic growth. 
Corporations and business groups on both sides of the Atlantic are also pushing hard for a pact. Tariffs on goods traded between the United States and the European Union are already low, averaging less than 3 percent. But companies that do substantial amounts of trans-Atlantic business say that even a relatively small increase in the volume of trade could deliver major economic benefits.
''The reason we care about this is because these base line numbers are so huge,'' said Karan Bhatia, a former deputy U.S. trade representative who is now vice president for global government affairs at General Electric in Washington. ''This could be the biggest, most valuable free-trade agreement by far, even if it produces only a marginal increase in trade.''
Noting that a free-trade agreement would not cost taxpayers any money, Mr. Bhatia said, ''This is the great, untapped stimulus.''
While China has dominated the political debate in the United States, U.S. trade with Europe is much larger, totaling $485 billion in goods in the first nine months of this year, compared with $390 billion in trade with China.
Perhaps more important for U.S. companies, Europe buys much more from the United States than China does. U.S. exports of goods to Europe through September totaled $200 billion, according to U.S. government data , while China imported $79 billion worth of U.S. goods.
''The economic music is between America and Europe,'' said Fred Irwin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany. The organization has been among groups lobbying energetically for a comprehensive agreement to replace the potpourri of existing tariffs and regulations and also to roll back national rules in Europe that may impede trade.
The chamber estimates that an agreement that eliminated tariffs and other barriers between the United States and Europe could add 1.5 percentage points to growth on both sides of the Atlantic. While that may be optimistic, economists agree that trade increases when barriers fall.
Supporters of an agreement hope that Mr. Obama will visit Europe early in 2013 and that he agree while there on a framework for negotiations that could lead to a detailed agreement within several years. They argue that a pact would offer Mr. Obama an opportunity to improve his relations with the business community while reaching out to European political leaders who feel he has taken them for granted.
''The Europeans believe that Obama does not care about Europe,'' said Mr. Irwin, who has met with E.U. government leaders on the trade issue.
Asked about the U.S. position, Andrea Mead, a spokeswoman for Ron Kirk, the U.S. trade representative, said in an e-mail that the working group ''continues to work to assess how best to increase U.S.-E.U. trade and investment to produce additional economic growth and jobs, and improve our international competitiveness.''
There does not seem to be any broad-based political opposition to an E.U.-U.S. trade agreement, as there was to Nafta. But some industry groups have expressed concern about how a free-trade accord would affect them.
Last week, a coalition of food and agricultural groups led by the National Pork Producers Council in the United States wrote to Mr. Kirk, expressing concern that a free-trade agreement might leave them out.
The council complained that in the past, Europe had blocked imports of genetically modified corn and soy products and objected to American companies' use of product descriptions like ''Parmesan'' cheese. In Europe, that label is reserved for cheese that comes from the Parmigiano-Reggiano region of Italy.
At least since the 1990s, there have been informal talks about an agreement that would reduce or eliminate already low tariffs and -- more crucially for many businesses -- harmonize regulations governing industries like pharmaceuticals and auto parts. While those talks wore on, political leaders on both continents focused on treaties with faster-growing countries like South Korea. Trade between the Europe and the United States already was believed to work pretty well, so there was little urgency to make it better.
''I haven't heard anyone say it doesn't make sense,'' said Peter Beyer, a member of the German Parliament from Ms. Merkel's party, the Christian Democrats, and a major advocate of an agreement. ''It just hasn't been at the top of the agenda.''
Efforts to improve the U.S.-E.U. trade relationship gained momentum after the failure of the so-called Doha Round of global trade talks. In addition, Canada and the European Union are close to a free-trade agreement, which puts pressure on the United States to follow suit. Mr. De Gucht, the E.U. trade commissioner, met Thursday with Edward D. Fast, the Canadian trade minister, and said in a statement afterward that negotiations were in the ''home straight,'' or final stages.
So far the Obama administration has been fairly quiet about a European trade agreement, perhaps wary of raising expectations. A so-called High-Level Working Group, which includes E.U. and U.S. representatives, is expected to make recommendations by the end of the year or by early 2013.
Even though the United States and Europe have a long history of trade and friendly relations, any agreement will be complicated because of the number of countries involved. The European Union has 27 members. Unlike Nafta, which eventually eliminated duties on goods sold between Mexico, the United States and Canada, a European free-trade agreement would focus more on harmonizing regulatory standards between the United States and Europe.
For example, Daimler, the German maker of cars and trucks, would like to see a trade agreement that freed it from having to obtain multiple certifications every time it puts a new variety of Mercedes engine on the market. The pharmaceutical industry is also particularly eager to avoid having to test new treatments on both continents.
''The current regulatory complexity slows down the approval of innovative drugs and cheaper generics in both regions,'' Ulf M. Schneider, president of Fresenius, a German health care company, said in an e-mail. Fresenius, based in Bad Homburg, near Frankfurt, is best known as the world's largest provider of dialysis services, but it also has a biotechnology unit that is developing cancer treatments.
But the complexity of regulatory issues also makes agreement more difficult, which is another reason why it has taken so long to reach one. ''History shows that removing nontariff barriers is much harder than removing tariff barriers,'' Mr. Schneider said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
