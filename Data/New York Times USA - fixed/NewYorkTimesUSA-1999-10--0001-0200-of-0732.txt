Watch Out For a Breakout
A lot of eyes are watching the box-office numbers this weekend. Of course, there are always a lot of eyes watching the weekend box-office numbers in Hollywood. Sometimes it seems as if that's all they're watching (that and one another). But this weekend a lot of people are watching with breath held and something resembling hope in their hearts. 
 "American Beauty," the acid-laced suburban comedy from the first-time movie director Sam Mendes, has been among the best-reviewed films of the year. It opened in just 16 theaters in 5 cities on Sept. 15, earning $54,846 per theater in its opening weekend, said Jim Tharp, distribution chief for Dreamworks, which is releasing the film.
Originally, the plan was to put the movie into wider release on Oct. 1. Instead, Mr. Tharp said, it was pushed into 429 theaters in its second weekend, when it still earned $13,838 per screen. This weekend it will expand to 704 theaters. At that point, "American Beauty" will have moved well beyond the big-city theaters into smaller cities and outlying suburban areas. If it continues to do well, even more screens will be added into mid-October.
"Those are big-time per-theater averages," said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles-based company that monitors box-office performance. "It remains to be seen how the film will play in Middle America. But based on the numbers for last weekend, it looks very promising."
A studio marketing executive said: "I hope it does make it. But it's a little early to be handing out gold medals. There are plenty of cases of movies that started out strong and then expanded onto more screens and died. This could turn out to be a $35 million movie, or it could be a $75 million movie. It's too early to tell."
Also this weekend another offbeat, independent-minded studio production -- David O. Russell's gulf war film, "Three Kings," starring George Clooney -- will be released by Warner Brothers. It is unusual for major studios like Warners and Dreamworks to release films like "American Beauty" and "Three Kings," both of which have more of the feel of an independent movie. And that's why so many people in Hollywood are interested in seeing how they do, along with another forthcoming studio film with an independent sensibility, David Fincher's "Fight Club," coming out of 20th Century Fox on Oct. 15.
"I am very interested in seeing if these movies do well, especially 'American Beauty,' " said one director who was busy with the release of his own fall movie. "If it does well and makes a lot of money, it's going to be a very good thing for all filmmakers, especially those interested in making sophisticated films for sophisticated audiences, instead of the latest high-concept or teen-gimmick thing."
 
Beyond Youth
Sydney Pollack, who has been making movies since "The Slender Thread" in 1965, is also interested in what older, more sophisticated moviegoers are going to see this fall. His newest film, "Random Hearts," with Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas playing a cop and a Congresswoman thrown together when they discover their spouses had an affair, is opening on Oct. 8.
"I've never gotten truly excited about something and had them say, 'Sydney, my boy, no, we can't make this movie because it doesn't appeal to the youth market,' " Mr. Pollack said. "That hasn't happened to me. Yet. I still believe there are exceptions to that youth rule, at least I hope there are. I think 35- or 40-year-old people are hungry for mature entertainment."
Among the things that have changed in the 34 years he has been making movies, Mr. Pollack said, is how "economics have started to color everything." Several of his films -- he named "Jeremiah Johnson" and "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" -- probably couldn't be made today, he said, "largely because it's just a different marketplace."
Young moviegoers, who have always been important to the film business but are even more important today, seem to want to see movies with young people in them, he said.
"The first knee-jerk reaction for a 23-year-old couple on a date is to go see a movie about 25-year-olds," he said. "But I still believe there are exceptions. At least, I hope there are."
 
A Matter of Structure
"It takes a while to figure out what you're good at, because at the beginning you think you can do anything," Steven Soderbergh said.
This director was slowly working his way through a sandwich during a break in the marketing mania of the recent Toronto International Film Festival. Mr. Soderbergh was at the festival, as he had been at Cannes earlier in the year, with his film noir "The Limey," about a British thug who comes to Los Angeles to find out who killed his daughter and makes rather nasty work of a bunch of Hollywood types. The star of the film, Terence Stamp (left), was seated at a nearby table. ("During the filming, Steven evoked feelings in me that hadn't been evoked since I worked with William Wyler," Mr. Stamp had said earlier. "You could just tell, with both of them, that they absolutely knew what they were doing.")
Mr. Soderbergh, who began his career as a film-festival darling with "Sex, Lies and Videotape" and whose last film "Out of Sight" was chosen by several critics' groups as 1998's best, has been able to bounce back and forth between the studio and the independent worlds. While "The Limey" is an independent effort, to be distributed by Artisan Entertainment, his next movie, "Erin Brockovich," will be made for Universal with Julia Roberts.
Mr. Soderbergh said that only now, after eight films, did he feel he understood his strengths and limitations as a director. This has led him to take more of an interest in the structure of his films, he said.
"When I finished 'Out of Sight,' I wanted to do something right away," he said. "I had a buzz. I was energized. I wanted to work again immediately. And I wanted to make a movie set in Los Angeles, but one without the usual visual cliches of L.A. movies. I was having all of these ideas about structure. I had this idea about playing around with how the meaning of an image can shift through repetition, how it begins to have a different meaning as the film goes on."
What "The Limey" had, he said, was a simple story line with well-defined, easy-to-understand characters that allowed him to take chances with time shifts and nonlinear storytelling.
"It's the simplicity of the through line that makes it work," he said. "Otherwise you'd have people saying, 'Huh, what's going on?' It could get ugly."
For "The Limey," Mr. Soderbergh adopted a new way of shooting his scenes, which he retained on "Erin Brockovich." He watches through the camera while the scene is being shot. Many people think that's how all directors work, but they don't. There has been a growing distance between the director and the set, often with the director parked in a tent many yards away, watching the proceedings on video monitors. Mr. Soderbergh said he had tried that approach and thought it was counterproductive.
"I want to look through the camera because it is bringing me as close to the movie as is humanly possible," he said. "It's literally like seeing the film while you are shooting. And I truly believe that the energy of the set needs to be directed to where the camera is pointing, not diffused between the set and some tent nearby."
Mr. Stamp said the technique had an extraordinary effect on his performance. "Steven could sometimes whisper directions to me while we were in the middle of a scene, while I was still in the moment," he said. "It was so intimate."
 
Happy Indeed
Steve Zahn, who appeared in Mr. Soderbergh's "Out of Sight," was also at the Toronto festival, as he had been at the Sundance festival earlier in the year, promoting his latest comedy, Mark Illsley's "Happy, Texas" (review on page 25). In the film he plays a supremely dimwitted convict who is forced to pose as a beauty pageant coordinator in a small Texas town.
The film emerged as one of the favorites at Sundance in January, but there was some grumbling about how Mr. Zahn (above) and his co-star, Jeremy Northam, were cast as straight guys pretending to be gay.
"You know how it is when you're meeting a new director, sometimes you try to test each other," Mr. Zahn said. "But in this case we hit it off immediately, and we agreed that we should not play these characters as over-the-top or flamboyant when they're pretending to be gay."
Ten minutes have been trimmed from the film and some extra looping of dialogue added since Sundance, Mr. Zahn said, but it was mostly little bits and pieces lost and additions for clarity.
Mr. Zahn said he was drawn to "Happy, Texas" by the richness of the comedy, even down to the smallest roles.
"Too many people are doing movies just to do movies," he said. "But here was a case where people were doing it because they really thought it was a good movie. You know, it's become a pastime for Americans to make fun of people, to laugh at people. A lot of the comedy now is about making fun of someone. I loved this because it wasn't like that. It was laughing at something that's a real story. You'd be surprised how rarely you see scripts like that."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
A Small Hockey Town Takes on the Big Guys

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
When it comes to capturing the bone-crunching, high-velocity world of sports, Hollywood has a surprisingly spotty record, often preferring to present the game as metaphor ("Field of Dreams") instead of diving into the bruising reality of the arena. But "Mystery, Alaska," an upbeat meat-and-potatoes movie that is a striking change in directorial style for Jay Roach, who oversaw the garish Austin Powers romps, conveys some of the thrill and ferocity of ice hockey while skillfully folding together multiple personal dramas.
Produced by David E. Kelley, the king of television drama ("L.A. Law," "The Practice," "Ally McBeal"), who wrote the screenplay with Sean O'Byrne, the movie is clearly a project dear to Mr. Kelley's heart. Twenty years ago, he was captain of Princeton's hockey team, and the screenplay includes enough technical jargon to demonstrate an insider's knowledge of the sport without clogging up the narrative. 
 "Mystery, Alaska" uses sport to explore the hardy psyche of a remote Alaskan town that lives and breathes hockey and that's pride and joy is its legendary pond hockey team. The movie has the look and feel of an unusually well-constructed television drama in which a dozen sharply drawn characters interact in ways that are fairly predictable without seeming too snugly formulaic. You can also feel the chill; the climactic game takes place in minus-10-degree weather. In an amusing satirical touch, Little Richard (of all people) opens the event with a rendition of the national anthem that is so slow that some of the waiting players worry that their bones will begin to freeze.
What sparks the drama is the return to Mystery of Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), a native son who forsook his hometown for New York City to become a television producer. Danner has come up with a promotional scheme to pit the locals against the New York Rangers in a nationally televised exhibition game to be broadcast live from Mystery. The show would be an economic boon to the town. Without actually demonizing Danner, the movie presents him as a shifty city slicker and the high-powered network personnel who descend on Mystery as blase media gypsies. One dreadful, pat and inaccurate marketing pitch proposed is to dub the Mystery team Eskimos on Ice.
The movie's moral and emotional grounding wire is Mystery's sheriff, John Biebe (Russell Crowe), a 13-year veteran of the team and local sports hero who is devastated to learn that he is being retired from the first string to make room for Stevie Weeks (Ryan Northcott), a naive eager beaver only half his age. Biebe is a terrific role for Mr. Crowe, whose Rock of Gibraltar machismo anchors the film in decent common-sense values. Biebe's demotion sends a shock through the town and through his marriage to Donna (Mary McCormack), who years ago dated Danner but chose to marry Biebe and live a very circumscribed life.
Other colorful characters include the town's Mayor, Scott Pitcher (Colm Meaney); Skank Marden (Ron Eldard), the team's resident stud who blithely cuckolds Pitcher; the local judge, Walter Burns (Burt Reynolds); his wife, Joanne (Judith Ivey); their hockey-playing son, Birdie (Scott Grimes), and their teen-age daughter, Marla (Rachel Wilson). Finally there is Bailey Pruitt (Maury Chaykin), the blustering hyper-emotional lawyer who travels all the way to New York to argue the team's case when the game is in danger of being canceled because of union problems.
What gives zest to a story that builds to a predictable David and Goliath confrontation on a pond (in which a Coca-Cola logo has been imprinted beneath the surface of the ice) is a screenplay that locates the characters' idiosyncrasies and a calm directorial style that respects their dignity even when they're under extreme stress. Where most films about small towns caught up in sports mania take a patronizing view of grown-ups living vicariously through their athletic children, "Mystery, Alaska" never questions the community's values. Without fawning over the players, the movie presents them as rugged, earthy embodiments of a healthy pioneer spirit that enables communities like Mystery to stay closely knit and proud.
"Mystery, Alaska" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and some strong language.

J. P. Morganto Take Korean Brokerage Stake

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 30

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company agreed today to take a 10 percent stake in the SK Securities Company, settling a $380 million lawsuit and ending more than a year of legal wrangling with several Korean financial institutions over losses in derivative securities.
J. P. Morgan will invest $85 million in SK Securities through a share sale that is partly aimed at raising money to pay Morgan an unspecified settlement fee. 
 "This is a win-win arrangement," said Yoon Soon Han, general counsel of the SK Group, which controls the South Korean brokerage house. "SK Securities can normalize its business while J. P. Morgan recovers a considerable amount of losses as well as securing a business opportunity."
The agreement is intended to end legal disputes between Morgan and SK Securities, the Housing and Commercial Bank, the Daehan Investment Trust Company and the Korea Investment Trust Company. The only outstanding dispute for more than $100 million yet to be settled is with Boram Bank, which was taken over by Hana Bank in January.
"We are very pleased that we have reached a settlement which provides us with a chance to focus on future relations," said Shuri Fukunaga, a Morgan spokeswoman in Tokyo.
The American bank upgraded its presence in South Korea to a full branch last October in anticipation of a turnaround in the nation's economy, which is now emerging from its worst recession since the 1950's. South Korea's central bank expects the economy to grow about 8 percent this year after shrinking 5.8 percent last year.
As part of the settlement, J. P. Morgan signed another pact with SK Securities, under which the Wall Street investment bank will provide the Korean brokerage with risk advisory, training, research and other business assistance.
Morgan is the latest foreign investor to make a foray into the South Korean brokerage industry. Regent Pacific Group, a Hong Kong hedge fund, acquired the Daeyu Securities Company. And an Asian-Pacific arm of Hambrecht & Quist, the San Francisco investment bank that has agreed to be acquired by Chase Manhattan, became the largest shareholder in the Good Morning Securities Company, formerly known as Ssangyong Investment Securities.
Morgan's disputes with South Korean companies arose over who should be responsible for derivatives losses begun with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997, an event that led to recessions in much of Asia.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Rise as Sellers Pause for Rest

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices were up for the first time in four days yesterday for several reasons.
Revised data on economic growth significantly eased investor concern that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates at Tuesday's monetary policy meeting. The bounce in prices was most likely a result of the oversold conditions in the market and an unwillingness among market participants to drive prices lower at this point. 
 Analysts said some window-dressing by portfolio managers at the end of the fiscal quarter was at work, spurring a little buying from Asian accounts overnight. The short maturities were firmer as market participants parked cash in them.
Despite yesterday's gains in stocks, there was still a flight to quality toward the Government bill market as many investors remained nervous and sought safe haven in the Treasuries market. Other analysts noted widespread declines in commodity prices, seen by some as barometers of inflationary pressures.
"Today looked more like a laundry list of excuses," said Kim Rupert, an economist with Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research firm in San Francisco. "But it's more the case that sellers are taking a breather, leaving buyers in charge today."
By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 1 4/32 , to 101 5/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, stood at 6.04 percent, down from 6.12 percent on Wednesday. The bond yield is only slightly lower for the month of September.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management, said he believed that the Fed would leave monetary policy unchanged when the Federal Open Market Committee gathers for its October meeting on Tuesday.
Mr. Fine went on to say, however, that "at this juncture, a tightening at the November F.O.M.C. forum is still clearly on the table, with the ultimate decision a function of the extent of any economic deceleration, the path of the inflation indicators and the direction of equity prices during the intervening period."
Mr. Fine added: "A further sharp correction in the stock market could quickly produce an economic slowdown via its impact on consumer spending, which could well obviate the need for further Fed tightening over the near term, should it occur. However, recently released economic statistics are still suggesting a buoyant pace of economic growth."
He said second-quarter gross domestic product was revised downward slightly, to 1.6 percent, but all indications point to a noticeable rebound in growth of the gross domestic product during the third quarter. And, he said, August new-home sales were surprisingly strong, with the near-record pace certainly not indicative of an economic slackening.

HEADLINE: China's Anniversary Party

 BODY:
The People's Republic of China, whose birth Mao Zedong triumphantly proclaimed from Tiananmen Square 50 years ago today, can claim some proud achievements. Ordinary Chinese citizens now enjoy higher standards of health, nutrition, education and personal comfort than at any previous time in the Middle Kingdom's long history. Beijing is also reclaiming its status as a great world power for the first time since foreign imperialists began imposing humiliating concessions on the Manchu emperors a century and a half ago.
But these gains have come at a terrible and continuing cost. Millions perished needlessly in the famines caused by Mao's erratic economic policies and millions more sacrificed their careers and ambitions to the fanaticism of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960's and 1970's. Virtually all the economic progress of the past half century has occurred since 1978, when Deng Xiaoping discarded the precepts of Maoist socialism, opened China's economy to the world and liberated the entrepreneurial energies of the Chinese people. 
 But neither Deng nor the current leader, President Jiang Zemin, has eased the suffocating political grip of Communist Party dictatorship. To this day, no public political dissent is tolerated in the People's Republic and those who openly challenge this arrangement are subjected to long prison terms under extremely harsh conditions. With party loyalists freed from public accountability, corruption flourishes, local officials abuse their authority and individual rights are regularly trampled.
Today's choreographed celebrations reflect the Chinese leadership's skewed priorities. They have been designed to showcase China's political uniformity, its military might and its ability to attract multinational executives. But it is a show of government power, not popular enthusiasm. While hundreds of thousands of party loyalists chant officially approved slogans, millions of Beijing's ordinary residents have been barricaded away from the festivities, potential dissidents are being closely watched and thousands of migrant workers have been shipped out of the city.
Despite the official self-congratulations, China faces serious problems. Its transition to a market economy remains incomplete. Banks are swamped with debt, and uneconomic state-owned enterprises drain resources needed for future growth. Behind the enforced political silence, there are ample signs of public cynicism about a Communist Party that claims no coherent ideology and clings ruthlessly to power simply for its own sake.
China also faces problems with the United States. Washington and Beijing have come a long way from the military confrontation of the Korean War and America's stubborn 30-year delay in diplomatically recognizing the Communist government. But relations continue to be troubled by Beijing's human rights abuses, accusations of Chinese nuclear espionage and meddling in American electoral campaigns, and tensions over Taiwan.
In the long run, the answers to many of China's problems lie in greater public accountability through wider democracy, from the lowest levels of village government to the highest rungs of power in Beijing. To maintain the political stability and economic prosperity it boasts of today, the People's Republic of China will have to find room for the unscripted voices of China's people.

HEADLINE: New Center Will Combat Computer Security Threats

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department will announce today that the Federal Government and the financial services industry have established an information clearinghouse to combat threats to computer security and vulnerabilities in computer systems.
The center, which will be managed exclusively by private industry, will be known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. It represents a second phase in the Clinton Administration's plan to create a nationwide system to combat cybercrime. 
 The Treasury system will rely on voluntary reports of incidents from banks and other financial institutions, in contrast to a centralized Federal Government surveillance system known as the Federal Intrusion Detection Network, or FIDNET, which is designed to use automated technology to track break-ins to Government computers.
Both systems are outgrowths of a classified Clinton Administration document known as Presidential Decision Directive 63, issued in May 1998. Its purpose is to develop systems to protect against attacks on the nation's computer networks.
However, a Federal plan that would effectively centralize FIDNET information and control inside the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the National Information Protection Center has drawn fire from civil liberties groups and from Congress. There are concerns that such a system monitoring all Government computers might create a de facto "desktop surveillance" network.
In contrast, the financial services clearinghouse plan developed by Treasury officials and private industry drew cautious praise from privacy groups.
"The governmental role is vastly scaled back, and it's not the central node," James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group, said of the Treasury plan. "It shows you can move forward on infrastructure protection without sacrificing privacy and without a major role for the Government."
A Treasury official said last night in a telephone interview that the new organization was being created in response to the Presidential directive and that it was only the first of a number of similar information-sharing and analysis centers that would be developed for other industry sectors.
"As our military and civilian sectors go increasingly on line, it creates a new vulnerability," the Treasury official said. "It does make sense to have this sort of an information and an analysis center."
In addition to the financial services sector of the economy, Government agencies leading similar industry efforts include the Transportation Department and the Federal Communications Commission, the official said.
The new alert system began undergoing testing in June and will start formal operations in the near future. The system itself will be based at the Science Applications International Corporation, which serves as a contractor to a limited liability corporation that has been established by a founding group of banks, brokerage firms and financial services companies.
Member corporations will be able to submit vulnerability and intrusion alerts anonymously and in return will receive both real-time alerts of problems as well as summary information prepared by human analysts at the center.
So far, 16 corporations have signed letters of intent to participate in the clearinghouse, but that number is expected to expand significantly after the center begins formal operation.
An industry executive said that the members were eager to have the system functioning soon to help protect against potential vulnerabilities associated with the Year 2000 problem.
The clearinghouse will not feed real-time information on specific intrusion incidents to the National Information Protection Center, an industry executive said. He said, however, it was considering making summary information available.
The system will also receive and distribute real-time security alerts from a variety of sources, including the Government.

HEADLINE: Growth Slowed Sharply in the 2d Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
United States economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter, to its weakest pace in four years, the Government said today, but booming August home sales showed it was already regaining power.
Gross domestic product advanced at a revised 1.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter instead of the 1.8 percent previously estimated -- the weakest three months since an increase of four-tenths of a percent in the second quarter of 1995. 
 Companies built up inventories at a much slower rate and the trade deficit soared, subtracting from national growth in the spring quarter.
Analysts said companies were restocking goods on hand for fear of supply problems if computer systems were disrupted by Year 2000 glitches, contributing to an anticipated rebound in growth in the third quarter that ended today and in the fourth quarter.
The gross domestic product report showed muted inflation and strong consumer spending, which was separately reflected in a later report showing August new-home sales climbed 2.9 percent, to the second fastest pace on record at 983,000 homes a year.
A third report from the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment pay were up 25,000 last week, to 299,000, because of the impact of Hurricane Floyd, which ravaged parts of the country earlier in the month.
Nonetheless, weekly claims have remained under 300,000 for the longest period in more than a quarter-century, a sign that jobs are ample.
In addition, the price component of the Chicago Purchasing Management Index jumped to 71 in September from 63.8 in August. The overall index fell to 53.8 in September from 56.1 in August, contrary to economists' forecasts for a slight rise.
The Chicago index's employment component also fell sharply in September, to 43.2 from the August reading of 50.3.
Analysts said the reports, among the final pieces of economic data that Federal Reserve policy makers will see before their meeting on Tuesday on interest-rate strategy, imply the central bank will keep rates steady.
"Our bet is that the Fed is not going to increase rates again next week," said Stan Dubinis of the National Association of Home Builders. "They're simply isn't enough evidence to justify their doing it."
Gross domestic product measures the output of goods and services within the nation's borders. It slowed steeply in the second quarter from a 4.3 percent rate in the first three months this year, but economists see no real threat to the steady expansion since the last recession in 1990-91.
In addition, jobs are plentiful and consumer confidence remains high. The gross domestic product report showed consumer spending grew at an upward revised 4.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter instead of the 4.6 percent estimated a month ago.
The first estimate of third-quarter economic performance will not be available for another month. The Commerce Department issues three estimates of quarterly gross domestic product. Thursday's report was the final one on the second quarter.
The revised second-quarter G.D.P. report showed inflation was even more dampened than previously thought.
Two key price measures -- the G.D.P. price index and the implicit price deflator -- each advanced at only a 1.3 percent rate instead of the 1.5 percent reported a month ago. That was down from 1.6 percent for each indicator in the first quarter.
Businesses increased inventories at a $7.4 billion annual rate in the second quarter, less than the $12.1 billion rate estimated a month earlier and far below the first quarter's $38.7 billion rate of inventory-building.

HEADLINE: U.S. Resolves A Dispute With Russia On Computers

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: SAROV, Russia, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The United States and Russia have quietly resolved a long-simmering dispute over the illegal sale of sophisticated I.B.M. computers to Russia's leading nuclear weapons lab, American officials said today.
In the process both sides have helped open to cyberspace what was once one of the most secret installations of the Soviet Union. 
 On Friday the 16 computers, now fully licensed and operational, will be on display as part of the "open computing center" that the American, Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, is to inaugurate at the lab that developed Russia's hydrogen bomb.
The center is a joint project of the Energy Department and Minatom, the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, to which Washington contributed $2.3 million. It is intended to help find jobs outside the weapons industry for thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians at this remote nuclear city and its premier lab.
In quiet talks for more than two years Washington had insisted that the computers, which I.B.M. sold to Russia in 1996 without the required export license, either be returned or openly dedicated to nonweapons work. Russia initially refused, but earlier this year, negotiators agreed that the computers would be incorporated into the computer center, which is expected to create 80 technology jobs in its first year and as many as 650 in the next five years.
The center is one of five projects planned here under the Nuclear Cities Initiative, which Mr. Richardson began last year. It is aimed at converting Russia's 10 closed nuclear cities to peaceful work. But Congress severely cut the Administration's request earlier this week, granting the ambitious undertaking only $7 million of the $30 million sought.
Mr. Richardson defended the initiative in an interview, saying he hoped to use money from other weapons conversion programs to help scientists here and at Snezhinsk and Zheleznogorsk, two other nuclear cities, to convert to peaceful work. "We are all concerned that scientists might be forced by economic necessity to seek employment in rogue states or among terrorists," he said.
Sarov, some 250 miles southeast of Moscow, is the Russian equivalent of Los Alamos, where America's nuclear bombs were designed. But in addition to designing bombs, this complex, roughly the size of Washington, D.C., still engineers, fabricates and assembles nuclear weapons warheads and components.
As part of the Soviet Union's effort to mimic the Manhattan Project, Stalin established a nuclear complex here in 1946 and closed the city. It takes its name from a monastery held sacred by the Russian Orthodox for its link to one of the most revered Russian saints, Seraphim of Sarov.
The walled monastery became the site of the first Soviet nuclear program under Stalin. The remote city was renamed Arzamas-16, which appeared on no Soviet maps. Not until 1990 did the Soviets acknowledge its existence. Russia restored the city's historic name in 1995.
Rady Ilkayev, director of the Russian lab and a prominent physicist, talked today about the institute's 30,000 employees, and their struggle to survive the downsizing of the nuclear weapons industry in this now impoverished city of 80,000. Dr. Ilkayev said the institute's staff had shrunk almost in half, to 18,000 employees from 30,000. Although the institute once controlled virtually all of the city's vital infrastructure, he said that 40 percent of Sarov's transport, 90 percent of its medical infrastructure and 70 percent of its sports arenas had now been transferred to the city government.
Fifteen percent of the lab's employees now work in the civilian sector; Dr. Ilkayev said he hoped to increase that to 29 percent by 2002.
Noting that the United States provides some 86 percent of the $8 million that the institute receives each year in aid from foreign governments and labs, Dr. Ilkayev called the United States his main partner. He said that American support had helped "prevent critical leakage" of key scientists with nuclear weapons expertise. He estimated that his institute would need $40 million over three years to restructure the lab. With Russian bank interest rates exceeding 50 percent, raising that amount of investment capital domestically is impossible, he said.
Russia had evaded American export laws by buying the I.B.M. computers in 1996 through Moscow-based middlemen. I.B.M. installed them here. Though a Federal grand jury investigated the transfer, no charges were brought against I.B.M.

Brazil's Efforts on Budget Imperiled by Court Rulings

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The country's highest court invalidated two important tax increases today in surprise rulings that could hurt the Government's efforts to narrow the budget deficit. The rulings unnerved investors and stocks tumbled nearly 3 percent.
The tax increases -- on the salaries and pensions of public employees -- were challenged by civil servants, and the Supreme Federal Tribunal sided with them in both cases. 
 The court unanimously upheld a lower court's finding that one tax, which varies from 11 percent to 25 percent for Brazil's 694,000 retired civil servants depending on the size of their pensions, was illegal.
A second ruling found that increased taxes on the salaries of 712,000 acting Government workers were unconstitutional. Many more civil servants on the state and municipal levels are affected by the rulings.
The decisions are a blow to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts to exert more fiscal discipline in Latin America's largest economy, which has struggled to recover from a currency crisis in January that led to a rescue package by the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Cardoso's administration has been trying to narrow a gaping budget deficit that corresponds to 12 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. Pension spending, payroll outlays and interest payments on Government bonds are the main reasons for the deficit.
"This shows that one branch of the Government is more concerned with preserving the privileges of the civil service as it sees fit rather than insuring the long-term health of the economy," said Marcelo Allain, the chief economist at Banco Inter American Express.
Analysts estimated that the decision would cost the Government 3.1 billion reais, or $1.6 billion, in lost taxes next year.
Stocks here plunged after the rulings, with the Bovespa index for the Sao Paulo stock exchange ending down 2.9 percent. The Brazilian real also weakened nearly 1 percent, and its exchange rate slid to a one-month low of 1.935 to the dollar.
"It makes me wonder about Brazil's ability to get serious," said Masaru Nakayasu, an economist here with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

Pledge by Ecuador
 WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (Reuters) -- Ecuador promised the International Monetary Fund today that it would take austerity measures by December as it struggled to reorganize its private-sector debt. The Government pledge came in return for an I.M.F. $350 million standby loan in the next 18 months.
 The agreement will let Ecuador begin talks to revamp its $6 billion in Brady bonds with private creditors in New York.

HEADLINE: University Stands Firm In Using Race In Admissions

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Disregarding the strongly worded advice of a Federal judge, the University of Georgia announced today that it would continue to use race as a factor in admitting up to 20 percent of its freshman class.
The announcement by the university president, Michael F. Adams, on an issue that has been the subject of intense debate for months, puts the school on a collision course with B. Avant Edenfield, the Federal District Court judge who has been hearing a series of challenges to the university's admissions policy. In a nonbinding opinion attached to a related ruling in July, Judge Edenfield said the university "cannot constitutionally justify" the use of race in admissions. 
 Because at least one new court case challenging the policy has already been assigned to Judge Edenfield, it is likely that he will have a fresh opportunity to issue a formal ruling against the school soon. But Mr. Adams made it clear that the university was reluctantly willing to accept a prolonged legal fight and a series of appeals to preserve the diversity of the student body.
"I believe that all of us have a responsibility to deal with the legacy of segregation as an issue in both academe and government," Mr. Adams said, in a speech that received a standing ovation from the University Council, an advisory body of faculty members, administrators and students. "My commitment to providing opportunity to all is fundamental, and under my leadership the University of Georgia will remain committed to this basic right."
In an increasingly conservative legal climate, when other schools have been backing away from their affirmative action policies, today's decision makes the University of Georgia one of the most prominent schools to voice full-throated support for racial preferences, particularly in the South. Hoping to banish the memory of the school's all-white past, most of the state's establishment has supported the admissions policy, including Gov. Roy Barnes and even Eric Johnson, the Republican minority leader of the State Senate.
"Those who argue that the only fair method is a statistical ranking of applicants' academic records miss an important point," Mr. Adams said. "True fairness also includes a professional assessment of unique family situations, the schools the student has attended, the community he or she came from and whether applicants had to overcome economic hardships to build a record of academic achievement."
Most students are admitted to the university without any consideration of race. Eighty percent to 90 percent of the members of each incoming class are admitted solely on the basis of their test scores and high school grades. The remaining 10 percent to 20 percent can have a slightly lower academic record, but their chances are better if they are nonwhite, or are the child of an alumnus, or the first in a family to attend college, or if they have unusual talents and civic accomplishments.
Despite the policy, only about 6 percent of this year's freshman class of 4,200 students is African-American, compared with 30 percent of the state population. About 15 percent of the class is nonwhite. But even this modest use of race as a factor was enough to prompt a lawsuit from A. Lee Parks Jr., an Atlanta lawyer who often represents clients trying to end affirmative action programs. Mr. Parks today accused Mr. Adams of caving in to pressure from faculty members.
"They had a wonderful opportunity to base their admissions on socio-economic factors that really demonstrated need, but instead they've taken the same old road," Mr. Parks said. "We'll be seeking an immediate temporary injunction against this policy, and now the litigation will come to a final head."
University officials, who clearly do not want black enrollment to drop, are now taking a firm stand on the fairly shaky foundation of the 1978 Bakke decision by the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that race could be one factor used in admitting students, as long as a quota system was not employed.
"Obviously the legal landscape has become uncertain and confusing since then," said Dan T. Coenen, a constitutional law professor at the university's law school. "But until the Supreme Court speaks again, it's still the law of the land, and this admissions policy is entirely acceptable."
Mr. Adams made it clear in an interview today that a ruling by the High Court would be welcome.
"It's an unsettled legal area," he said, "and we might all be better served in the long term if it could be made more clear."

HEADLINE: Fund Adviser Is Indicted In $3 Billion Fraud Case

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Martin A. Armstrong, the investment adviser and chairman of Princeton Economics International, was indicted by a Federal grand jury yesterday on charges that he defrauded foreign investors in connection with the sale of $3 billion in securities issued by Princeton.
Mr. Armstrong, who was also chairman of Cresvale International Ltd., a brokerage firm based in Hong Kong, was charged with conspiracy and securities fraud September 13. He surrendered to authorities and was released on a $5 million bond, co-signed by his two children and his mother. 
 Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, unsealed the indictment yesterday.
Mr. Armstrong denied the charges, telling Bloomberg News, "They are absolutely false, dead false."
Federal prosecutors say Mr. Armstrong lured Japanese institutional investors into a scheme on the strength of his glowing, but false, securities trading record. A Cresvale Web site stated that Princeton Economics, of Princeton, N.J., had generated a 20.51 percent average annual return in 1998.
Investors were promised that Mr. Armstrong would use their funds to trade currencies, bonds and derivatives and that they would receive returns of at least 4 percent and in many cases much more. Between 1996 and August 1999, Mr. Armstrong took in approximately $3 billion selling so-called Princeton notes.
But prosecutors contend that instead of generating returns, Mr. Armstrong lost aboout $368 million between November 1997 and August 1999. To conceal the losses from his investors, prosecutors say, Mr. Armstrong used funds from new investors to repay those who had invested earlier. He also lied to investors about their accounts' values, prosecutors said.
According to the indictment, between March 1998 and August 1999, more than $750 million went into Mr. Armstrong's trading account at the Republic Securities Corporation, a subsidiary of the Republic New York Corporation, a bank holding company. At the same time, $925 million was transferred out of the account to various bank accounts around the world, including those relating to Princeton Economics, Cresvale International and Mr. Armstrong.
Although the indictment does not detail his investments, Mr. Armstrong was known to be bullish on the United States dollar. But the dollar has been weak against the Japanese yen this year, hurting Mr. Armstrong two ways. In addition to betting on the dollar in his trades, he had promised to pay his investors back their principal and interest in yen. As the yen increased in value against the dollar, Mr. Armstrong's i.o.u.'s got much more expensive.
As of Aug. 31, Mr. Armstrong owed investors about $1 billion, but the value of his trading account was approximately $46 million.

The economy is still growing at a rapid clip. Commodity prices are rising. With unemployment low, workers are demanding and getting higher wages.
But for every signal suggesting that inflation might be lurking just over the horizon, there are others indicating that price increases are well under control and that whatever inflationary pressures might be building will dissipate in coming months. 
 As a result, the Federal Reserve is likely to leave interest rates unchanged when its policy committee meets on Tuesday, analysts and economists said.
Fed officials have hinted as much in their public statements during the last few weeks, saying that they see prices as stable and the economy's ability to grow without inflation benefiting from huge investments in productivity-enhancing technology.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, typically gives markets a clear warning when he is seriously considering a rate increase, but in a speech tonight in Minnesota, he did not mention current economic conditions or monetary policy. Instead, he warned about the dangers of trade protectionism.
Less clear is whether the Fed will feel compelled to nudge rates up at its subsequent meeting, in mid-November. If the economy does not show clear signs of cooling off somewhat in the next six weeks, analysts said, there is a good chance that the central bank will nudge its benchmark rate up by a quarter of a percentage point by the end of the year. The clearest clue to the Fed's intentions will be whether it adopts a formal tilt toward higher rates at its meeting next week.
"Given their rhetoric of late, the Fed is going to stay on hold at the Oct. 5 meeting," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "There is a distinct possibility that they could issue a directive biased toward tightening, which would put us on a rate-hike watch for the Nov. 16 meeting."
The Fed has raised rates twice this year in quarter-point increments, most recently on Aug. 24 when it increased its Federal funds target rate to 5.25 percent. At the same time, the central bank said inflation risks had been markedly diminished, a sign of its confidence that growth would slow to a noninflationary pace.
The Commerce Department said today that the economy grew at a revised annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter, down from 4.3 percent in the first quarter. The Government had previously estimated growth at 1.8 percent in the second quarter.
Subsequently, though, growth has rebounded considerably, and most economists now forecast that the economy expanded about 4 percent in the quarter that ended today and will maintain something close to that pace for the rest of the year.
"That's maybe a little more rapid than the Fed wants, but there are some indications that things are slowing down a bit," said Stephen D. Slifer, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
Sales of new homes rose 2.9 percent in August, the Commerce Department said today. But other interest-rate-sensitive activity suggests that the general upward trend in rates during the last several months is starting to work its way through the economy. Mortgage refinancing, for example, which has put more cash in the pockets of many consumers, has slowed substantially.
The downturn in the stock market is also likely to diminish any fears among Fed officials that the economy is overheating.
But the strongest case for holding rates steady may be that there are almost no signs of consumer price inflation. Core inflation -- excluding the volatile energy and food prices -- rose just 1.9 percent in the last year.
"If that isn't price stability, I don't know what is," William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told reporters last week.
With inflation so well behaved, Fed officials speak more openly about the possibility that their traditional models for predicting inflation are no longer worth much. As a result, they seem less inclined to raise rates before they are sure that inflation threatens the long expansion.
"Suppose, like now, we're uncertain about the underlying model of the economy," Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech on Monday. "In that case, pre-emptive policy can lead to the wrong action. When there's a high degree of uncertainty about forecasts, it could be best for policy to be more cautious -- in the extreme, to wait until inflation actually starts to rise before acting to tighten."
Still, there are enough signs of persistently strong demand and inflation-warning signals that the Fed is sure to remain vigilant in coming months.
Orders for durable goods unexpectedly rose again in August after a big surge in July. Consumer confidence, while dipping, remains high, and job creation remains strong even as the supply of available workers is shrinking.
Prices for oil and other commodities are rising. Demand for American goods from abroad is picking up, and the dollar's long rally appears to be coming to an end, creating the risk of higher import prices.
"We're seeing a strong economic performance, probably stronger than most at the Fed think is sustainable," said Kenneth T. Mayland, an economist at Keycorp in Cleveland. "More and more evidence is coming in that there has been a change in the inflation environment."
For much of this year, economists speculated that the Fed would be unlikely to raise interest rates during the last two months of 1999 because of fears that the computer problems associated with the end of the century might wreak havoc with the economy.
But as Government officials and corporate executives have grown more confident that the United States will escape any serious problems, analysts have changed their minds and now think the Fed will be willing to tighten policy in November if the economic data justify higher rates.
"The Y2K situation is going so smoothly now that it's much less of a constraint on Nov. 16 policy action if deemed necessary," Mr. Mayland said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Underwriting of Stock and Bond Issues Slowed in September

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
So much for the post-Labor Day rush on Wall Street.
The primary business of investment banks -- underwriting sales of stocks and bonds -- is slowing in the second half of 1999, not accelerating as some bankers and traders had predicted. Securities firms and banks issued $473 billion of stocks and bonds in the third quarter, a 3.5 percent increase from $456.8 billion in the third quarter of 1998, but a marked decline from the first two quarters of 1999, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. 
 September had been expected by some to be an especially busy month as corporations hurried to sell bonds before fears about Year 2000 complications scared off investors and drove up borrowing costs. But that pickup did not occur; rather, the quarter ended on a downbeat, depressed by concerns about rising interest rates.
"The most remarkable thing was the continued weak state of the corporate bond market, despite the very strong fundamentals," said Jeff Chandler, a managing director at Merrill Lynch & Company. "A lot of borrowers are sitting back and demonstrating that they do have the luxury of time and can sit back and wait until next year if they want to."
Worries that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again next week continued to hang over the market, Wall Street executives said. But if the Fed makes no change and sets off a rally in bond prices, the anticipated rush to tap investors for loans before year-end could materialize in October, they said.
Otherwise, said Mark Seigel, a managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, "things will slow down as we approach year-end." In the wake of the financial crises that roiled the bond markets in the last two years, Mr. Seigel said, investors have shown a decided preference for bonds issued in large amounts by companies with strong credit ratings, like the $8.6 billion offering by the Ford Motor Company in early July.
Riskier high-yield bonds, known as junk bonds on Wall Street, were a much harder sell. Junk bond issuance was just $2.2 billion in September, the lowest total since July 1995, said Richard Peterson, an analyst at Securities Data.
Merrill Lynch again led all securities firms in total underwriting volume. In the third quarter, Merrill Lynch handled about 17 percent of all stock and bond volume. Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit ranked second, followed in order by Goldman Sachs Group, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Those rankings are important to investment bankers because they use them as weapons in battles for underwriting assignments. But, in the end, the most important measure is the fees those assignments generate because some deals are much more lucrative than others.
In general, investment banks earn fatter fees from stock issues, especially companies' first-time offerings, than from bond issues. That is why firms that have strong franchises in distributing stock tend to rake in more fees.
Goldman, Sachs took in $339 million in disclosed fees in the third quarter, or about 15 percent of the industry total of $2.3 billion, according to Securities Data. That put Goldman ahead of Merrill Lynch, which took in $284 million in disclosed fees. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter ranked third, with $262 million.
Fee revenue correlates closely with how the firms stacked up in stock underwriting, which held up better in the quarter than did the bond business. Firms handled about $27 billion in new stock in the quarter, more than double the $13.7 billion a year before, but well below the $46.7 billion in the second quarter of 1999, which was full of initial public offerings by Internet companies.
Of the 147 initial offerings in the quarter, 71 of them, or nearly half, came in the Internet sector, Mr. Peterson said.
"Clearly, there is an appetite for new ideas and new issues and it's particularly strong in technology and communications," said Tom Tuft, co-head of equity capital markets at Goldman, Sachs. "A lot of deals are getting done despite the fact that there's been a lot of choppiness in the market."
Mr. Tuft said he expected a full calendar of stock offerings in October and November, then a slower-than-normal December. "Most people are focused on getting deals done before Thanksgiving," he said.
Merger and acquisition activity rose by 43 percent, to $766 billion in the third quarter, from $535 billion a year earlier, based on the value of the announced deals. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter ranked as the leading adviser, ahead of Goldman, Sachs. Most of the action occurred in Europe, home of the targets in four of the five biggest deals announced. Morgan Stanley was also the leading adviser in United States deals, which declined 12 percent to $315 billion, from $358 billion a year before.

HEADLINE: City Union Is Offered Transit and Domestic Partner Benefits

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
The city has reached a tentative agreement with the largest municipal union to offer city workers a break on mass transit fares and to extend medical-leave benefits to unwed workers caring for domestic partners.
The deal with District Council 37, which covers working conditions but not salaries, would also increase reimbursements for work-related expenses. The agreement was announced yesterday by the Council and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 While the proposed contract covers a variety of benefits, James F. Hanley, the city's Commissioner of Labor Relations, said its most significant element was the creation of the mass transit commuting incentive.
Known as Transitchek, the program is a Federal tax break that would allow city employees to buy monthly Metrocards with their pretax income, reducing their commuting expenses at no cost to the city. Mr. Hanley said the benefit could be in place by early next year.
"It's good for mass transit, it's good for the environment and it's great for employees, especially lower-paid employees," Mr. Hanley said.
The proposed agreement, which was reached on Wednesday, would also eliminate a disparity in benefits between married and unmarried employees. City workers already have medical coverage for domestic partners, but they have no provision to receive leave to tend to ailing domestic partners. The agreement would change that, giving the unmarried workers the same benefits their married peers have.
Salaries are covered by separate economic contracts, but this agreement would grant a number of nonsalary increases in certain payments. For instance, it would increase mileage allowances from 25 to 28 cents a mile, increase the overtime meal allowances by 75 cents and raise the limit on overtime pay to $54,549 from $45,805 a year.
"We believe we have put together a package that will mean real improvements in the working conditions and daily lives of our members," said Lee Saunders, the trustee who runs District Council 37.
District Council 37 is the largest bargaining unit representing city workers. If ratified, the agreement would cover roughly 100,000 of the union's members. Both Mr. Hanley and Christopher Policano, a council spokesman, said they expected the agreement to be ratified by the end of the year.

Major Stock Gauges Finish 3d Quarter on Positive Note
Stocks ended the third quarter on a positive note, as a rally in the bond market helped to push major market indexes higher. They also benefited as mutual fund managers bought shares of companies that have done well to make end-of-quarter reports look better to their investors. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished the quarter at 10,336.95, after rising 123.47 points, or 1.21 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased by 14.34 points, to 1,282.71, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 15.89 points, to 2,746.16. Page C8.
 
Underwriting by investment banks slowed in the third quarter. Securities firms and banks issued $473 billion of stocks and bonds, a 3.5 percent increase from $456.8 billion in the third quarter of 1998, but a marked decline from the first two quarters of 1999. C8.
 
Brazil's Tax Increases Struck Down
Brazil's highest court invalidated two tax increases in surprise rulings that could hurt the Government's efforts to narrow the budget deficit. The rulings sent the stock market tumbling nearly 3 percent. C4.
 
Health Insurers' Stocks Fall
Shares of major health insurers, including Aetna, which was down $10.4375, to $49.25, declined amid reports that trial lawyers were preparing lawsuits on behalf of managed care patients. Lawyers who gained high profiles in tobacco litigation and other cases are preparing to sue managed care companies and seek class-action status after some large legal judgments against the insurers.

HEADLINE: A Mighty Port's Final Call;
Bayonne Army Terminal Closes, Its Future in Doubt

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: BAYONNE, N.J., Sept. 30

 BODY:
An era ended today, not with a bang but with a mournful happy hour at Kapps Bar and Grill on Broadway.
And then they turned out the lights for good at the United States Army's Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, once the biggest employer in town, now a memory of another era in a working-class town with a better sense of its past than its future. 
 "I'm going to cry again," said Judy Barbito, over the Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Patsy Cline songs at Kapps, which welcomed generations of workers from the Army installation in its earlier guise as Patsy's. "When I was driving out of the base, the tears were coming down. My husband said, 'Why are you crying?' and I told him, 'You don't realize this is the last time we're going to drive out of here.' "
Of course, they had known for years this day was coming. As the end of the cold war has lessened the need for a large military force, the Federal Government has been closing military installations all over the world. In 1995, it decided to close this one, a base whose main purpose was to help transport military equipment to wherever it was needed, by boat, aircraft or train.
"We moved everything from toothbrushes to tanks," said J. Craig Hawley, garrison manager, who has worked at the base for 25 years.
Bayonne, a peninsula city of 61,000, was a natural for the job. There are views of water from almost anywhere -- Upper New York Bay to the east, Newark Bay to the west and the Kill Van Kull separating Bayonne from Staten Island.
The Bayonne military base was opened by the Navy during World War II, in 1942. By 1967, with use declining, the base was transferred to the Army. In 1996, the Army had 2,500 employees here, many of them civilians who lived in the area. Since then, employment had dwindled to the 200 jobs that were phased out today. Of the 2,500, some accepted transfers to other military bases and some retired, while the 200 or so who were last to go generally worked on finding new positions for the others.
"The town was really closely affiliated with the base," said Andrew Kopycinski, 29, who worked at the installation's personnel office. "You thought of one, and you thought of the other."
Mr. Kopycinski, who was born and raised in Bayonne, worked at the base for 12 years, starting as a summer hire. His father worked there, and his grandfather was based there during World War II.
Mayor Joseph V. Doria Jr., who also grew up here, said he remembered his parents bringing him onto the base for Armed Forces Day, when the Army, or the Navy before them, demonstrated their skills in the water or the air.
"It's a day of sadness as well as happiness, that we're moving onto new challenges," he said unconvincingly, as he stood at the base gates saying goodbye to the commanding officers for the last time.
At 437 acres, with a sweeping view of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline, the base property is the largest piece of undeveloped land in New York Harbor. The military is turning over the property to the city, and a local redevelopment agency is to decide what the city will do with it, an issue that has been a reminder of the uncertain road ahead.
Under former Mayor Leonard P. Kiczek, the redevelopment agency had come up with a plan to build a stadium and amphitheater on the property, and eventually a hotel and other recreational facilities, with the main objective to give the people of Bayonne access to the harbor.
"It's a spot that's indescribable," said Mr. Kiczek, who also grew up in Bayonne. "It's the kind of place where any father whose daughter was going to get married would want her to have her wedding."
A consultant's report prepared for the agency said the plan would have created about 10,000 jobs.
But when Mayor Doria, who is also a Democratic State Assemblyman, defeated Mr. Kiczek, also a Democrat, in the last election, and took office in the spring of 1998, he appointed new members to the redevelopment agency and came up with a plan that devotes more of the peninsula to shipping and other commercial activities.
Mr. Kiczek, a former City Attorney, said he believed the new mayor came up with the plan, which would provide many fewer jobs, to please the leadership of the Bayonne local of International Longshoreman's Association, the union representing the stevedores and others who loaded and unloaded the ships for the Army. The I.L.A. is a strong political force in the city and supported Mr. Doria in the last election.
Mr. Doria appointed the president of the I.L.A., John Angelone, to the agency, but Mr. Angelone had to resign this summer when he and other union leaders were indicted for offering kickbacks to contractors.
Joe Ryan, Mr. Doria's press spokesman, said that Mr. Doria's plans were not influenced by his support from the union. Instead, he said, Mr. Doria's plan offered more full-time and better-paying jobs and was based on the idea that the property was developed as an ocean terminal and that it should remain that way. He also said Mr. Kiczek's job estimates included temporary positions, such as those in hotel construction.
But today, the future of the base property was not as important as the past many of these workers are leaving behind.
Several dozen of those who still worked at the base gathered at noon time at Kapps to reminisce, to laugh and finally to cry about a place that provided as much of a family connection as their own relatives.
"I worked here right out of school," said Ms. Barbito, who is 45 and graduated from Bayonne High School. "In those days, they gave you the civil service test right in the high school. If you passed it, you went to work here. If you didn't, you didn't."
Ms. Barbito stood with two of her girlfriends from high school who worked at the base for about as long as she had. They recalled the countless birthdays they celebrated together, either after work or at lunchtime at the many bars and restaurants that catered to base employees, like Rincon Spanish Restaurant, or Meditarraneo on Broadway. They talked about the base picnics where everyone brought their families.
"Am I going to miss it?" asked Millie Santiago, who worked here 20 years, as she started to cry. "I enjoy working here. I love to work here. I liked caring for all the people. That's what I'll miss the most -- the people.
Ms. Santiago said she and her husband, who recently retired from an auto body shop, will move to Puerto Rico, where she is from. But she will keep in touch with her former co-workers, whose parties she attended for holidays or their children's birthdays.
"It was like a family," she said, over the strains of Sinatra's "My Way" on the jukebox. "But this is it. It's over. It's over."

HEADLINE: Ford Planning To Spin Off Parts Division

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company plans to spin off its giant auto parts division directly to shareholders and give wage and job guarantees to the division's factory workers in a contract under negotiation with the United Automobile Workers union, people close to the matter said.
The future of the parts division has been a major problem for Ford as it tries to hammer out a new labor contract. The company had considered selling the unit, called Visteon Automotive Systems, to either the Lear Corporation or to Delphi Automotive Systems Inc., which was itself spun off in May from the General Motors Corporation, the people said. 
 But labor issues along with tax considerations have instead persuaded Ford to spin off Visteon, which had $17.8 billion in revenue last year.
On Tuesday night, G.M. reached tentative agreement with the United Automobile Workers union on a four-year contract that included annual raises of 3 percent a year on top of inflation adjustments, plus increased pension benefits and a $1,350 signing bonus. Delphi, with $28.5 billion in revenue and 48,000 U.A.W. workers, also reached an agreement Tuesday with the union on a separate labor contract with nearly identical terms.
Those agreements included a promise to allow Delphi workers who retire by the end of 1999 to be covered by G.M.'s pension plan, effectively a three-month extension of a promise given when Delphi was spun off to G.M. shareholders. After that point, they would be covered by a similar Delphi pension plan. The factory workers have lobbied for coverage under the parent company because they worry that the parts company may be less financially solid.
Now that Delphi has reached a deal with the union on how its workers will be treated, the union is expected to allow Ford to follow the same pattern for Visteon's 23,500 workers, according to a person close to the union, making a tax-free spinoff of Visteon to shareholders more attractive. After the spinoff, Visteon would agree to a four-year contract with the same wage, benefit and job protections in the Ford pact.
Labor contracts for the 400,000 factory workers at G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler were to expire Sept. 14, but have been extended as the union negotiates new contracts. DaimlerChrysler was the first to reach agreement, and the union has demanded that the other auto makers accept the pattern of wages and benefits laid out in the DaimlerChrysler contract.
Workers at Visteon factories had opposed a sale or spinoff, worrying that their wages and pensions would not be as stable at Visteon as they would be at Ford. In recent weeks, some of Visteon's salaried employees have sent E-mail messages to management, protesting plans to sell the unit to another auto parts maker, fearing that their jobs would be eliminated because of overlap with the buyer.
Senior company officials exploring the sale of Visteon ran into tax roadblocks. They could not devise favorable tax treatments for selling Visteon to another auto-parts maker, a person close to the planning said.
Ford had worried that an agreement attached to DaimlerChrysler's labor contract that was intended to limit asset sales would hinder Ford's ability to sell Visteon. Union and Ford officials said, however, that they expect the union to allow Ford to shed Visteon as long as it follows the pattern set by Delphi earlier this week.
Under those circumstances, a spinoff of Visteon seems appealingly simple to Ford. Union and company officials anticipate that they will agree on a labor contract covering Ford's 101,033 unionized workers as soon as the middle of next week.
While the labor situation is fluid, and Ford could always change its plans for Visteon if a buyer offered a higher price for it, a person close to the matter said, Ford expected to announce within a month its intention to spin off Visteon to shareholders.
Ford had been discussing a sale of Visteon to Lear since the summer, but the possibility of Delphi's buying Visteon had not been previously reported. In a surprising move, Richard Shoemaker, a union vice president in charge of relations with G.M., suggested in closed-door meetings that Delphi consider buying Visteon, the person said.
A Delphi spokesman, Peter Rowe, said today, "We've evaluated pieces of Visteon's business over the years, as we would any supplier." But he denied that discussions had gone beyond that point.
A Ford spokesman, Jim Cain, declined to discuss the company's plans for Visteon.
But Ford has told Wall Street analysts in the past that shedding Visteon would make sense only if the transaction was tax-free.
Analysts said antitrust concerns would have complicated, but probably not scuttled, the merger of any big parts companies by forcing the divestiture of certain product lines. Early last year, when the Federal-Mogul Corporation bought T & N P.L.C., of Britain, the Federal Trade Commission determined that the combined company had too high a share in the thin-wall engine bearing business, and forced Federal-Mogul to sell T & N's global engine-bearing business to the Dana Corporation.
"If Delphi bought Visteon, that's certainly a doable deal, but they might have a problem in climate control," said John A. Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, explaining that both Delphi and Visteon build lots of heating and air-conditioning units.
"But no one would care about Delphi owning their glass business," because Delphi does not have a big glass business, he said, speaking hypothetically.

HEADLINE: Tower to Rise Above Port Authority Terminal

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In yet another indication that the search for increasingly rare development sites in Times Square is pushing westward, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey selected a developer yesterday to build a $500 million, 35-story office tower atop the bus terminal at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue.
Lawrence Ruben Company and Vornado Realty Trust plan to build the million-square-foot glass and steel tower, which would be known as 7 Times Square, over the north wing of the midtown terminal. The terminal and tower, as proposed, would be adorned with the large, splashy electronic signs that have become characteristic of Times Square. 
 Under a 99-year agreement with the Port Authority, the two companies would pay more than $110 million for the development rights over the bus terminal. That figure includes a $20 million renovation of the terminal's north wing intended to smooth the passage of more than 187,000 commuters a day. The final terms of the deal are still being worked out.
"We're looking forward to executing our vision for 7 Times Square," said Lawrence Ruben, whose company owns or manages 6 million square feet of space in New York, Boston and Washington. "I don't think we're changing the Times Square neighborhood so much as the changes in the area have allowed us to do this project."
The developers said they would begin construction after they obtained final approvals and a tenant for half the office space.
Ruben and Vornado were selected over two other developers, Larry Silverstein and George Klein, based on price and design, according to executives at the Port Authority. The Port Authority staff expects to conclude a final lease with the developers within 30 days.
"It would serve as the western gateway to 42d Street and Times Square," said Charles Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority. "I'm pleased that we're finally building above that garage."
Ten years ago, a new office tower on the west side of Eighth Avenue in what was known as Hell's Kitchen, would have been unimaginable. A recession had left many existing buildings with vacant space and Times Square was more known for prostitutes and peep shows than blue chip companies.
Since then, the Walt Disney Company, Viacom, Conde Nast Publications, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and others started moving into the neighborhood. And a surge in demand for office space has cut the midtown vacancy rate by two-thirds, to 6.6 percent, the lowest point in 18 years, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate broker. The average rent for prime office space in midtown has jumped to $48.40 a square foot, up from $34.97 in 1995.
Reuters, Ernst & Young, and Morgan Stanley are now building new towers in Times Square, while Bertelsmann AG and Bear Stearns are building elsewhere in midtown. Chase Bank, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Deutsche Bank, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and other companies are looking for new homes and do not have many places to consider.
Ruben and Vornado are hoping to lure tenants to what they say will be first-class office space above the terminal, second only to one in Tel Aviv as busiest bus station in the world. The developers also plan to build 80,000 square feet of retail space in the four-story terminal itself and modernize the transit points for commuters.
The tower would rise above the four-story north wing of the terminal, which was built in 1950. Two years ago, the Port Authority announced plans to sell the development rights above the terminal, which runs an annual operating deficit. Five developers submitted proposals, including plans for a hotel.
But as the office market improved, the Port Authority selected three finalists, each of whom proposed to build an office tower. The vast terminal site would allow a developer to build floors measuring 65,000 square feet, broad expanses that are attractive to financial companies.
"The large floor plates lend themselves to a financial user," said Bruce Mosler, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield, who is working with the developers. "The lack of alternatives makes it a very important project."
The Port Authority has also signed tentative deals with two other companies to build a driving range and golf center above the south wing of the midtown terminal, and a large multiplex movie theater over the bus terminal at the George Washington Bridge.

HEADLINE: Campaign Retooled, but Gore Makes Usual Stops

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
On the first day of his retooled campaign, Vice President Al Gore spent a day much like any other. He addressed corporate officials in New York City, walked the streets of a depressed upstate town and returned to the city to meet with reporters and then financial contributors for his second fund-raiser in two days.
Yesterday's trip was Mr. Gore's first foray outside Washington after announcing plans on Wednesday to revitalize his Presidential campaign by moving his headquarters from Washington to Tennessee and by holding smaller, more intimate events that would, as he put it, get him closer to the people. 
 He repeated that theme yesterday morning, saying he would take his campaign "from K Street in Washington to the aisles of K-Mart in Nashville." Chris Lahane, his press secretary, said Mr. Gore did not mean to imply that he would be running a cut-rate campaign, only that he would be spending more time with "real" people and less time with Washington insiders.
But a sense of frugality was an important message to convey as it became clear that Mr. Gore had raised less money in the last three months and had less cash on hand than his sole Democratic challenger, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
There was little yesterday to indicate that Mr. Gore had pared down his campaign, but he did try to break out from the trappings of the Vice Presidency, plunging in the crowds in midtown Manhattan and shaking hands, lingering, much like President Clinton. At one point, he grabbed a cellular phone from a bystander and said, "Hi, this is Al Gore" to the person on the other end of the line.
But Mr. Gore still traveled in a lengthy motorcade. And he made his comment about K-Mart on the 56th floor of a Park Avenue office tower to about 200 executives, a group that would probably be more comfortable in the offices of lobbyists on Washington's K Street than in a K-Mart.
For most of the day, except for his stroll around a couple of blocks of Amsterdam, N.Y., where he shook hands with unemployed residents in the shadow of a closed toy factory, Mr. Gore stuck to traditional venues and sounded traditional themes of universal child care, stronger public education and spreading economic prosperity throughout the country.
The formats that he chose generated little of the fanfare that often accompanies Presidential campaigns. That was especially true of his visit to Amsterdam, a town of old rug mills that were converted to making toys and then went out of business, where he met with residents and then led an hourlong forum on reviving depressed areas.
He stopped and chatted with residents who had come out on their front porches.
Albert Choat, 26, a laid-off worker from a nearby plant, said Mr. Gore earned his respect "because he talked to us." Dave Passafiume, 33, who is unemployed and finds Amsterdam "dead," was less enthusiastic. "I can't find a job," Mr. Passafiume said, adding that he thought few politicians could really make a difference.
Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, accompanied Mr. Gore and announced grants of $300,000 to help Amsterdam. Mr. Cuomo said later that the purpose of the visit -- trying to spark economic revitalization -- did not lend itself to typical campaign excitement.
"This is a bad-news topic, the upstate economy," Mr. Cuomo said. "The basic message is, 'We have a real problem to deal with.' "
Those who met Mr. Gore were pleased nonetheless.
"He came right to us, and that makes a significant difference," said Elizabeth DeBella, 36, a nurse from nearby Schenectady.
Earlier in the day, the New Yorkers who met Mr. Gore had a good impression of him as well. Leon Wagner, an investment banker, saw him at the Sky Club on Park Avenue. "He is so much better in person," Mr. Wagner said.
"The reason that myself and friends are going to get behind the Vice President now is -- I work on Wall Street -- it's a little like getting behind a stock that's a little soft," Mr. Wagner said. "The perception is that Bradley is on an uptick, but the fact is the Vice President has experience. And frankly, I'm not willing to vote against the prosperity that we have."
At a fund-raiser in New York City, Mr. Gore drew about 300 people and raised $500,000.
Instead of focusing on issues, Mr. Gore talked about himself. Recalling the Vietnam War, in which he served after enlisting in the Army, Mr. Gore said: "I became completely disillusioned with America. I saw my country go into a long, dark tunnel called the Vietnam War, and I felt my country being torn apart by the seams."
He said he was ridiculed when he returned home and wore his uniform. "I felt hatred from my fellow Americans," Mr. Gore said.
His career in journalism, Mr. Gore said, helped him reconnect with what he called the "American spirit."

HEADLINE: Rising Incomes Lift 1.1 Million Out of Poverty

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Lifted by the strong economy, American households are climbing out of the income stagnation that has plagued them for years.
Rising incomes brought 1.1 million poor Americans out of poverty last year, and the percentage of people still below the official poverty line fell to the lowest level since 1989, the Census Bureau reported today. But the Bureau's annual report on trends in American wages contained some troubling news as well. 
 Although household income is at its highest level since the 1980's, income inequality remains unyielding. And among blacks, incomes failed to rise and the poverty rate failed to fall, as both had in 1997, though blacks held on to their gains from the boom that began four years ago.
But the new Census data suggested that the strong economy and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years have played big roles in improving the lot of millions of American households.
"You raise wages in the short run by tightening the labor market, but that has its limits," said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "You cannot make the unemployment rate much lower than it already is, and if wages are to continue to rise, that depends on the productivity of workers and their bargaining clout with management."
The income of the median household, meaning that half the nation's households earn more and half less, recovered the ground that had been lost in the 1990's, and a bit more. The median rose by 3.5 percent, the biggest jump in 13 years, to $38,885, finally edging past the 1989 figure of $37,997, adjusted for inflation. Households above and below the median enjoyed roughly similar increases.
The most troubling aspect of the Census Bureau report concerned income inequality, which has been resistant to the economic boom.
Although incomes rose last year for most households, the gaps between the rich and the poor, and between the rich and middle-income Americans, have failed to narrow in the prosperous late 1990's. And 1998 was no exception.
A high-end household, with an annual income of $133,000, for example, still earned eight times more than a family at the poverty line in 1998 of $16,655 for a four-person household. That has been the ratio since 1993.
But President Clinton saw a glass half full in the failure to shrink income inequality. Noting that the gaps had widened during the economic expansion of the 1980's, he argued that economic growth in the 1990's had been powerful enough to halt the process.
"Finally we have stemmed the tide of rising inequality," Mr. Clinton said, "and this new report documents the strong income growth among all groups of people."
Others are less sanguine. After six years of recession or weak expansion, they note, a period of unusually strong economic growth kicked in four years ago. Unemployment, at 4.5 percent last year, was at its lowest level in decades. Wages have risen for tens of millions of Americans, even after allowing for inflation. The economy is indeed lifting many boats, but a rising economy, the critics argue, has not yet reduced income inequality.
"If the strongest economy in 30 years is unable to ameliorate this serious economic and social problem, there is a strong rationale for public policy that addresses these concerns," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, which favors a higher minimum wage and laws that would strengthen labor unions.
Congress is considering a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour in two annual installments of 50 cents each. Administration officials argued today that the earned-income tax credit, by rebating money to low-income households, had played a role in reducing poverty and preventing the income gap from widening. Citing this view, President Clinton criticized Republicans today for a proposal now before Congress to defer some of those tax rebates.
The Census report showed that for the third year since 1994, more than a million Americans rose above the official poverty line. The percentage of the population still in poverty fell to 12.7 percent, or 34.5 million people, from 13.3 percent, the lowest level since 1989. The rate among blacks, 26.1 percent, is the lowest level on record, though it is still a striking 2.5 times greater than the rate for whites. But for the first time since 1993, there was no noticeable change from the previous year. Among Hispanics, on the other hand, the poverty rate dropped by nearly 1.5 percentage points, to 25.6 percent.
The steady rise in income in the late 1990's has been due in part to Americans' working longer hours. But in 1998 time spent on the job leveled off at 3,149 hours a year -- roughly 60 a week -- barely changed from the 3,139 hours in 1997, according to an analysis of the Census data by the Economic Policy Institute.
But other comparisons made the 1998 numbers seem less impressive. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities pointed out that the poverty rate, for all its decline in recent years, is still above the rate for any year in the 1970's. Similarly, poverty rates among children fell a full percentage point in 1998, to 18.9 percent. That level is well above the rate in the 1970's, and higher than in Canada or Western Europe.
The decline in the poverty rate came almost entirely as a result of a sharp drop in the South. Everywhere else, there was no change to speak of, the Census Bureau said. The South, in fact, has shrunk the percentage of people in poverty throughout the decade -- partly because many companies have moved operations there, generating millions of jobs, and partly because a big percentage of the population earns the minimum wage and thus benefited from increases in that minimum in 1997 and 1998. Poverty in the West, by contrast, has risen during the decade, partly because of an unusually large influx of immigrants, some economists say.
The Census Bureau's report highlights household income because that includes virtually every American, including unmarried young people living alone or with friends.
Family income is also calculated, and that showed a similar improvement in 1998, the median level rising to $46,737 in 1998 from $45,262.

HEADLINE: City Must Shield Workfare Force On Harassment

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration violated Federal law when it turned away women who said they were being sexually harassed while working for their public assistance benefits, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled in a decision made public yesterday.
The city has maintained that the women were not employees and had no legal right to protection from sex discrimination in the workplace. 
 The commission's finding came in the case of a homeless mother of two who charged that her city supervisor in a welfare-to-work program had pressed her for sex and retaliated against her when she refused. The commission, which found reasonable cause to believe the city subjected the woman to sexual harassment and sex discrimination, has between 5 and 10 similar cases in various stages of investigation, according to lawyers involved in them.
The women received subsistence benefits only on the condition that they work off the public aid in city clerical jobs at the equivalent of the minimum wage. New York City, which has the nation's largest workfare program, with about 40,000 participants at any one time, is the only jurisdiction known to be contending that such workers are not entitled to the protection of Federal civil rights laws against sex discrimination in the workplace, according to Yolanda Wu, a lawyer with NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the organization that represents the woman whose case led to the ruling.
"The city does not condone sexual harassment of any kind," Lorna Goodman, a senior lawyer in the city Corporation Counsel's office, said yesterday. "If the civil rights laws do not cover these types of workers because they are not legally employees of the city, that does not mean that they have no redress." She said the women could bring private lawsuits against the individuals they say harassed them, or even bring criminal charges of assault in cases where they say male supervisors groped them.
But Ellen Vargyas, legal counsel for the E.E.O.C. in Washington, said Federal regulations and court rulings now make clear that welfare recipients in workfare programs are protected by all anti-discrimination laws to the same extent that other employees are.
"It doesn't matter what you call them," she said. "It boils down to 'Does the alleged employer control the manner and means of work.' "
The woman in the E.E.O.C. ruling was not named, but she said in legal papers that she was picked out from an orientation session for 50 welfare applicants by the man who became her supervisor in the spring of 1997. Over the next few weeks, she charged, he made unwanted sexual advances, and pressed her to go to a motel with him for sex.
In retaliation for her refusal, she said, she lost her job and had to fight to keep her welfare benefits.
Maria Gonzales, one of the women with a pending case before the E.E.O.C., said yesterday at a news conference that she had complained to two levels of supervisors, to no avail, that her boss at the city's Human Resources Administration grabbed her genitals, demanded sex, stole her time cards and threatened her life when she refused his advances.
"I don't think it's right that the city should treat women who need their help like this," said Ms. Gonzales, 32, who was unemployed and was facing eviction when she applied for public assistance in 1997. "I have nightmares and I still cry when I talk about this, and I'm still very afraid of that man."
In a third case before the commission, a woman charged that city supervisors ignored her complaints that her boss at another workfare site was pinching her buttocks and ribs and putting his hands down her pants, according to Jack Bryant Tuckner, who represents her and Ms. Gonzales. Finally, she was transferred to another assignment, he said, but later the city allowed the same boss to follow her there.
When the commission sought to investigate several complaints of sexual harassment, the city refused to cooperate, maintaining in its legal papers that the commission had no authority to look into charges made by public assistance recipients because they were not employees.
After the E.E.O.C. went to Federal court in Manhattan to enforce subpoenas for city records connected with three of the cases, the city also argued that supplying the requested information would violate the confidentiality of welfare recipients.
"I know it's not a particularly sympathetic position," Ms. Goodman said. "But this is a legal issue. We have a good faith duty to protect the taxpayer." Most of the women who have experienced sexual harassment in workfare jobs are afraid to complain, said Marc Cohan, a lawyer with the Welfare Law Center, the organization that helped the homeless mother of two keep her benefits.
She succeeded in earning her high school equivalency diploma and finding work in the private sector on her own, Mr. Cohan said.
"Why should she have less protection just because she's poor?" he asked. "We have a supposedly law-enforcement Mayor who is hiding behind legal technicalities instead of addressing what is a horrendous situation. It's absolutely outrageous that the city's claiming its program mirrors the world of work, and then it denies these women the basic rights that are available to other workers."
In its written decision, the E.E.O.C. said its investigation determined that the city's Human Resources Administration had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the basic Federal law that prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race and sex, because "it failed to inform a class of employees who worked as participants in New York City's Work Education Program, funded through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, of their rights under Title VII" and also failed to provide any mechanism to complain about harassment.
The law requires the commission to now try to eliminate the unlawful employment practices with persuasion and conciliation. If that fails, the E.E.O.C. can go to court.
 The women involved were barred from suing in court until they exhausted the E.E.O.C.'s remedies, Ms. Wu said, adding that NOW had unsuccessfully sought meetings to discuss the problem with the city for two and a half years.

HEADLINE: A Night for Giuliani to Pay Tribute to the Reagan Legacy

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: SIMI VALLEY, Calif., Sept. 30

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wrapped himself in the legacy of Ronald Reagan tonight in a speech that glorified the former President and seemed an unusual approach for an unannounced Senate candidate who would need Democratic votes to win in New York State.
In delivering the annual Reagan Lecture at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library here, Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Reagan one of the two most important Presidents of the 20th century -- the other was Franklin D. Roosevelt -- and "a force for good in the world." Mr. Giuliani praised Mr. Reagan's supply-side economics, which Democrats to this day say caused the huge deficits of the 1980's and favored the rich. "Who says that supply-side economics doesn't work," the Mayor said. "Of course it works." 
 Aides to the Mayor said Mr. Giuliani was attaching great importance to the speech, which in its lengthy discourse on foreign policy seemed more Presidential than senatorial in its ambitions. Aides also said that Mr. Giuliani viewed it not so much as a campaign speech as a tribute to the former President in his twilight years. Mr. Giuliani reveres Mr. Reagan, and served in his two administrations as Associate Attorney General and United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
The annual lecture was created by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation to honor "conservative public figures or policy makers" who "reaffirm and apply the principles that guided the President and shaped his enduring legacy."
An official at City Hall acknowledged that there were some political considerations to the speech, and said that it could help with those voters upstate and in the suburbs who may distrust the Mayor of New York City but have fond feelings for the President who gave birth to the term the Reagan Democrat. Mr. Giuliani himself pointed out at a fund-raiser at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Wednesday that Mr. Reagan carried New York in both the 1980 and 1984 Presidential elections.
The speech's Republican orthodoxy also outlined the themes of the battle that Mr. Giuliani is almost certain to fight against Hillary Rodham Clinton, his likely opponent in the Senate race next year. The Mayor told the audience of 450 Reagan faithful, who interrupted his speech several times with applause, about how he had reduced the welfare rolls in New York and believed in "freedom of choice" in education. In praising Mr. Reagan for returning powers to state and local governments, Mr. Giuliani in part credited the former President for his own election as Mayor, an event that Mr. Giuliani sees as pivotal to the city's resurgence. Without Mr. Reagan, Mr. Giuliani said, there might have been "no innovative governors -- and maybe there'd be no Republican Mayor of New York City."
Mr. Reagan, 88, has Alzheimer's disease and did not attend the lecture. Nancy Reagan, the former First Lady and a trustee of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, served as the host. The day before, she welcomed Senator John McCain of Arizona on a stop of his Presidential campaign. In his speech Mr. Giuliani said Mrs. Reagan was the one person aside from the former President who is "most responsible for the Reagan legacy that we celebrate tonight."
Mr. Giuliani spent a large part of his speech praising Mr. Reagan for ending the cold war and building up America's defenses. He also criticized President Clinton for a foreign policy of "confusion" and a weakened military. "The next President," Mr. Giuliani said, "will have to rebuild American foreign policy."
In remarks to reporters before the lecture Mr. Giuliani said that he had not yet read Edmund Morris's new authorized biography of Mr. Reagan, "Dutch," which paints the President in his second term as an out-of-touch loner who was often in his pajamas in the White House family quarters by 6 P.M. watching television. "I only read the prologue," Mr. Giuliani said. "Let me read the book first before I comment on it."
After the speech at the Mission-style library with its distant view of the Pacific Ocean, Mr. Giuliani went with Mrs. Reagan and such Reagan friends as Betsy Bloomingdale and Charles and Mary Jane Wick to dinner at the nearby Sherwood Country Club.
Mr. Giuliani's speech came at the end of a three-day fund-raising and political trip to Washington, D.C., Las Vegas and California. This morning Mr. Giuliani played golf on the lush course of palm trees and oleander at the Stockdale Country Club in Bakersfield, Calif., then spoke at a lunchtime fund-raiser in the clubhouse dining room. As has happened throughout this trip, one of the guests asked him about the status of the city's battle with the Brooklyn Museum of Art over an exhibition that the Mayor has termed "disgusting."
The Mayor's responses to the question have grown increasingly descriptive. In Washington he extensively described a sliced pig in formaldehyde, calling it "a biology experiment at best." In Stockdale today he said the entire exhibit "belongs in a psychiatric ward."

HEADLINE: Top Pataki Adviser to Quit For Job on Bush Campaign

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Charles A. Gargano, Gov. George E. Pataki's top economic adviser, will leave the state government soon to take a top position in George W. Bush's Presidential campaign in New York, advisers to Mr. Pataki said today.
The move strengthens the ties between Mr. Bush, the Governor of Texas, who is the favorite for the Republican Party's Presidential nomination next year, and Governor Pataki, who would like to be considered for the party's Vice-Presidential nomination. The two Governors have met privately several times, and will campaign together in New York next week. 
 Mr. Gargano, 64, a former construction executive and Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago, will become the New York State chairman for Mr. Bush, largely a fund-raising position. It is a familiar role for Mr. Gargano, who was the chief fund-raiser for former U. S. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's 1992 re-election, and for Mr. Pataki's successful 1994 campaign against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Thanks to his close relationship with Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Gargano has been a fixture in New York's Republican Party politics for a generation. He managed Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election effort in New York and served as the state party's finance chairman.
Since Mr. Pataki took office in 1995, Mr. Gargano has held a number of state positions, including Commissioner of Economic Development and chairman and president of the Empire State Development Corporation. His state jobs have given him a prominent role in such varied efforts as the construction of a new Pennsylvania Station inside the Farley post office building, redevelopment of the Hudson River waterfront and the "empowerment zone" in Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx. He is also vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Democrats and some government watchdog groups have complained about what they see as a conflict between Mr. Gargano's role as solicitor of campaign contributions from corporate donors and his power to award millions of dollars in state contracts to those same donors. In mid-1995, Mr. Gargano said he would not hold any fund-raising positions while he was in state office, but he would not rule out a more informal role in gathering money for Republican candidates.
The Empire State Development Corporation is under investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which has subpoenaed reams of its records, looking for evidence of irregularities in some of its contracts. As a result of that inquiry, an official of the corporation pleaded guilty in June to accepting a bribe in return for placing a statue in Battery Park City.
Mr. Gargano, known in political circles for his charm and his powers of persuasion, spent many years as an executive at J.D. Posillico Inc., the dominant construction company on Long Island.
He served from 1981 to 1983 as a deputy administrator in the Federal Department of Transportation, and directed President Reagan's re-election effort in New York in 1984.
He served as ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago from 1988 to 1991, and he still likes to be referred to as "Ambassador."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
An Entree of Skewered Patrons and Mixed Nuts

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS

 BODY:
There is life in prison without parole. There is walking on a bed of stainless-steel spikes without your shoes on. There is being shackled to the wall of a dark chamber crawling with giant tarantulas. And then there is the restaurant business.
More to the point, there is a job taking reservations for one of the snobbiest four-star eateries in Manhattan. The assignment is to referee the dirtiest wrestling match around, to sit with a bank of phones and discover the pathetic lengths to which one's status-obsessed fellow beings will go for a meal, even when they have no appetite. Forget the pan-seared tartlets of rock Cornish leg of seahorse on their fricasseed beds of distressed kale. 
 Dining out at the top of the food chain apparently is not about evolved cooking. It's about plain old threats, bribes, tantrums, ego, humiliation and outright sadism.
If it weren't so sad, it would be funny. Well, actually, it is very funny, at least as it plays out in "Fully Committed," Becky Mode's mocking dismantlement of megalomaniacal chefs, coked-up maitres d'hotel, food-averse V.I.P.'s, strung-out publicity agents and customers with exploding bowels. The play, which opened last night at the Vineyard Theater, does as much to shake the foundations of the temples of haute cuisine as a squadron of flies in the vichyssoise.
Rarely has a playwright pegged so entertainingly the insecurity at the heart of the New York sense of entitlement, the fear that is manifested at the in place of the moment of (a) not getting a table, (b) not getting your favorite table and (c) getting the table with the view of the dishwasher. It's a terror of comeuppance that extends in "Fully Committed" to the staff and, in particular, to the martinet of a chef who has been driven barking mad by the pressures of tending to the precious herb garden of his own image while kowtowing to the demands of a contemptible elite.
The chef, a Hannibal Lecter in kitchen whites, is the play's crowning achievement -- his desire to watch his underlings squirm is positively kinky -- and the actor Mark Setlock plays him with deadly accuracy. Mr. Setlock, in fact, plays everyone in this intermissionless one-man show, which has been smartly directed by Nicholas Martin. Mr. Martin has proved his mettle with solo shows; he staged "Full Gallop" with Mary Elizabeth Wilson at the Manhattan Theater Club.
In "Fully Committed," the central character is Sam, an unemployed actor who handles the telephones in the basement of an unnamed restaurant on the Upper East Side. Mr. Setlock did in fact once have a job fielding calls for Bouley, the TriBeCa restaurant that David Bouley operated until 1996. Ms. Mode had worked there as well; she asserts in the program, though, that the characters are pure invention and that she has made up the incidents involving real people.
Ensconced in the cavelike quarters -- James Noone's snappy set design suggests a pod in a space capsule -- Sam spends virtually the entire play on the phone, carrying on both ends of the conversations with a pleading, screaming, put-upon public. He also juggles internal calls from the members of the eggshell-walking staff of the establishment, where the nomenclature makes the cooking sound as if it were the subject of a United Nations conference. "The chef calls it 'global fusion,' " Sam explains.
Ms. Mode doesn't mince words, which is half the delight. Names are dropped in this deeply New York-centric play; Naomi Campbell, Henry Kravis and Diane Sawyer all have designs on tables. Mr. Setlock is scaldingly funny as an 84-year-old woman calling to gripe about the lack of a senior citizen's discount, and her tepid meal: "The lamb was bittah cold." And his portrayal of Jean-Claude, the maitre d'hotel, is a devastating caricature of a major domo with trouble sniffing out celebrities but none with putting drugs up his nose.
Like those tell-all tomes that the second footmen to royalty and mistresses to powerful men sometimes write, "Fully Committed" feels like an act of revenge. It has no message to impart, except perhaps, to be kind to the help: you never know who's taking notes. Anyone who has ever been on the receiving end in a menial job will find comfort in Sam's plight. But those who recognize themselves in Ms. Mode's delicious broadsides may never have lunch in this town again.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES -- INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
As Business Confidence Grows, Euro Stages a Comeback

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 1

 BODY:
After a nearly nonstop slide against the dollar for the first six months of its life, the euro is coming back into vogue.
The euro, the common currency adopted in January by 11 European nations, jumped 3.6 percent this week. On Friday it reached $1.0767 in European foreign-exchange trading, its highest level in eight weeks, before settling in New York at $1.0728. 
 That level is still well below the euro's opening value of nearly $1.18 at its introduction on Jan. 4, but it represents a big shift since the currency plunged to just a bit more than $1.01 in July.
Many analysts now believe the euro will continue to climb in the weeks ahead, even if does not recoup its original value.
The immediate reason for the rise is a growing suspicion that the European Central Bank, which oversees the euro, might raise interest rates soon to help cool inflationary pressure. Rising rates tend to make a currency worth more.
But the broader reason behind the euro's advance is an unmistakable acceleration of European economic growth and a big improvement in business confidence over the last month or so.
Growth nearly came to a halt last fall, after the Asian and Russian financial crises. European exports and industrial production are now once again climbing.
In Germany, Europe's biggest and most beleaguered economy, business confidence has soared in the last month, in part because Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has veered sharply to the right and is pushing through big cuts in taxes and spending.
European central bankers have turned much more hawkish in the last few days, warning that inflationary pressure might be rising again and that it might well be necessary to cool things down with an increase in interest rates.
Christian Noyer, the bank's vice president, warned on Monday that price pressures had increased and that the bank might have to react to the inflation risk sooner rather than later. Today, two of the bank's top officials issued broad hints in the same direction.
Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president, said Europe's outlook for growth had improved and dangers to price stability should not be overlooked. Otmar Issing, the bank's chief economist, warned that price pressures were on the "upside" and should not be ignored.
"Their message has changed over the last four weeks," said Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. "I wouldn't overrule an increase in interest rates at the next meeting."
The bank's board of governors is scheduled to meet next Thursday, and the mere possibility of a rate increase has led traders to buy up more euros and sell more dollars.
Economists at Deutsche Bank Research, reflecting the view of many experts, still predict that the bank will probably not raise rates until next year.
Even so, analysts say there are other reasons for the euro's second wind.
Economic growth appears to be picking up in both Europe and Japan, a development that is tending to pull capital out of the United States.
"With the rest of the world looking better, it is now more difficult to finance it," Mr. Fels said. "Capital is looking for other places to go."
As growth prospects here and in Japan improve, investors are also focusing more anxiously on the huge trade deficit of the United States. A widening deficit means that a larger supply of dollars is leaving the country to pay for imports, which can have a weakening effect on the currency's value.
Among the more surprising areas of economic expansion in Europe is France, where the growth rate could reach 3 percent this year and where the unemployment rate has fallen from more than 12 percent to about 11 percent.
Smaller euro-zone countries like Finland, Spain, Portugal and Ireland are all growing rapidly. And though Germany remains Europe's debilitated economic giant, business confidence has climbed sharply there in the last month.
That is one reason analysts believe the European Central Bank will probably raise rates in the not-too-distant future.
Back in April, central bankers were so worried about declining confidence and even the possibility of a recession that they reduced the European bank's key interest rate from 3 percent to 2.5 percent. But the climate has changed considerably since then.
"The main rationale for the rate cut back in April was that confidence was very low," said Sonja Helleman, a currency analyst at Banque Paribas in London. "But that is not the case now."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Shares Decline Amid New Concerns About Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks resumed their slide yesterday after new reports showed that the economy's surging growth had not slowed in recent months. The data renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates next week.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.95 points, to 10,273, after falling nearly 153 points earlier in the session. The blue-chip index ended a fairly volatile week just 6.33 points below the close on Sept. 24. 
 Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.10 point, to 1,282.81, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.31 points, to 2,736.85.
Stocks fell after the Commerce Department reported that personal income -- which includes wages, interest and government benefits -- had risen half a percent in August, the eighth consecutive monthly increase.
At the same time, consumer spending rose nine-tenths of a percent in August and the personal saving rate matched a record low of negative 1.5 percent. While robust consumer spending has powered the growth of the United States economy, many economists fear that inflation will begin escalating if spending continues unchecked.
The market's decline accelerated after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that the manufacturing sector grew at a stronger-than-expected rate in September. The group also said that prices of raw materials had reached their highest level since May 1995.
"First the personal income and consumer spending report knocked the market down," said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "Then the N.A.P.M. really was the bullet. The market really didn't like the rise in prices paid."
The Fed has tried to stave off inflation by raising interest rates twice so far this year. Fears of a third increase have kept stocks off balance for the last month. While many analysts expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged when it meets Tuesday, yesterday's reports injected a last-minute note of uncertainty.
Economists say interest rate increases take several months to produce a measurable effect on the economy.
The inflation-sensitive bond market responded immediately to the signs of continued economic growth. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 7/32, to 99 29/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.13 percent from 6.04 percent Thursday.
"Bonds had a very bad day, and were certainly a trigger for the weakness in stocks," said Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. "Over all, there's still a lot of risk in this market."
Hewlett-Packard fell 3 3/8, to 87 3/8. The computer maker warned that its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue could fall short of Wall Street expectations because of component shortages caused by last week's earthquake in Taiwan.
I.B.M. fell 3 1/4, to 117 3/4.
Revlon shares slumped 6 1/4, to 12, after the cosmetics maker said it expected a loss in the third quarter. Revlon has not been able to find a buyer, so it now is looking to sell its salon-based business and some Latin American brands.
Eli Lilly rose 4 3/8, to 68 9/16. The Food and Drug Administration granted the company approval to sell an estrogen substitute as a treatment for osteoporosis and the prevention of brittle bones in women who are past menopause.
Merck rose 3 5/16, to 68 1/8, after it presented strong results from tests of the drug Fosamax, used to treat male osteoporosis.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered those advancers by a 7-to-5 margin. Volume of all listed shares totaled 1.01 billion, compared with 1.02 billion in the previous session.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.77, to 423.53.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Shows Unexpected Strength

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturing sector grew in September much more strongly than expected, while prices of raw materials soared to the highest level in more than four years, according to a business survey released yesterday.
The report by the National Association of Purchasing Management confirms that industry is recovering from the Asian financial crisis and provides further evidence that the overall economy rebounded from a sluggish second quarter. 
 And the Commerce Department released statistics yesterday showing that the personal income of Americans climbed in August for the eighth consecutive month. But their spending rose even faster, leaving the nation's savings rate matching a record low.
The combination of reports kept alive Wall Street's fears that the economy was overheating, sending stocks and bonds tumbling on worries that the Federal Reserve will try to cool things off by raising interest rates for a third time this year. Fed policy makers meet Tuesday.
The purchasing managers' group said the manufacturing sector grew in September for the eighth consecutive month. Its index rose to 57.8 percent -- the highest since a reading of 59.2 percent in November 1994 -- and was up sharply from 54.2 percent in August. Analysts had expected little change in September.
A reading of more than 50 is a sign of an expanding industrial economy.
The index is closely watched because it is the first national reading for September on the nation's manufacturing performance, a key sector of the economy.
The Government said earlier this week that the United States economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent in the April-June quarter, but many analysts viewed the spring lethargy as a brief pause, predicting stronger growth for the second half of this year.
David Huether, director of economic analysis for the National Association of Manufacturers, said that yesterday's purchasing managers' report appeared to support expectations of renewed economic strength.
Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the management group's business survey committee, said in a statement releasing the September results that the survey's price index jumped to its highest level since May 1995.
The price index surged to 67.6 percent in September from 59.8 percent in August. That was the highest since 70.5 percent in May 1995, the association said.
The Commerce Department report showed that personal income -- which includes wages, interest and government benefits -- rose half a percent in August, the eighth consecutive monthly increase.
The increase was a bit more than the four-tenths of a percent forecast by analysts and followed a two-tenths of a percent increase in July.
But spending went up nine-tenths of a percent in August, also more than analysts had expected.
As a result, the nation's savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- fell to minus 1.5 percent, matching the record low set in May.
In another report, the Commerce Department said that construction spending fell an unexpected four-tenths of a percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $692 billion, a sign that one of the economy's strongest sectors was beginning to slow.

HEADLINE: Beijing Shows Off Military Weapons to Impress the Chinese and Others

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 1

 BODY:
With a Soviet-style procession of goose-stepping troops, tanks, missiles and fighter jets setting the tone for the parade marking its 50 years of Communism, China showed off a formidable armory today, even if few of the weapons could match the latest Western models.
There were no technological surprises to cause gasps in Taiwan or in Washington. Still, military attaches from foreign embassies here eagerly studied the display through binoculars, viewing some of China's best antiaircraft missiles and other systems for the first time. 
 Yet potential foreign adversaries were not the main intended audience today, Chinese and Western experts said. "The military parade is intended to show confidence and strength, especially domestically," said Zhang Yunding, director of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "It's to give the people a sense that we have a new China, to let people feel proud of that rather than to focus only on our current problems."
Any intimidation of Taiwan is an added benefit, Mr. Zhang said.
Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corporation in California, said, "The leadership wants to signal that it's not standing still and that it can display this prowess, at least as much to its own citizens as to the world at large."
Today's parade, the first of its kind in 15 years, also served the political ambitions of Jiang Zemin. In a stiff drive-by review of the forces today from an open-roofed limousine, Mr. Jiang imitated Deng Xiaoping's performance in 1984 and also showcased his own positions as chairman of the Central Military Commission, President of China and general secretary of the Communist Party.
If the tanks and jets on display today were a generation or so behind the world's best, the Chinese also displayed mobile short- and medium-range ballistic missiles that are nearly impossible to counter.
China still lacks the ability for sustained air and naval operations that would be necessary to invade well-defended Taiwan, 100 miles offshore and the main focus of Chinese military planning. And should the United States be drawn into combat, China would almost certainly be outfought by American ships and planes, which can strike precisely from hundreds of miles away.
But the mobile missiles on display today, which are being deployed adjacent to Taiwan in growing numbers, could serve in a sense as equalizers, able to inflict terrible damage on the island as well as on more distant American bases.
The parade also featured the recently tested DF-31 intercontinental ballistic missile, which can reach parts of the United States. Unlike China's existing, vulnerable nuclear forces, this weapon can be moved about, lending it far greater protection from surprise attack.
The military chest-thumping comes at a time when the long outmoded and underfunded military has gained status in top political circles and, almost certainly, a new boost in money for weapons development and purchases.
Many of China's best weapons, including some fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles seen today as well as naval destroyers and submarines, have been purchased from Russia.
China's military spending is higher than the published budget shows. But even with recent increases and any new additions, most Western experts say, the total remains a fraction of the American military budget, forcing hard choices.
The generals' political stock is up these days, experts say, because the modernization of Chinese forces now seems all the more urgent.
The Americans' display of precision bombing in the Persian Gulf war of 1991 caused consternation in China's backward military and led to a major overhaul that is still going on. This spring, the long-distance prowess shown by the United States in its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia was, in the words of an army newspaper here, "a new wake-up call" to the Chinese military.
"It was a big surprise to the military people," Mr. Zhang said. "There's really pressure now to develop high-tech weapons."
This summer's war of words with Taiwan, too, heightened the sense of urgency. In the months since Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, declared that relations between Taiwan and China should be conducted "state to state," a statement Beijing took to be a step toward formal independence, the Chinese press has been filled with assertions about China's new capacity to easily vanquish Taiwan. But thus summer's crisis forced China's military and political leaders to confront how limited their military options actually are, especially with the specter of American involvement in Taiwan's defense.
Apart from backward technology, the Chinese military is in the throes of multiple transitions, and its leaders appear especially anxious to avoid any conflicts in the next few years, outside experts said.
Burdened with a surplus of troops, a legacy of the old doctrine of "people's war," the three-million-strong army is trying to reduce its numbers by another 500,000 after already pruning one million people in recent years. But the dearth of jobs for cashiered soldiers is slowing the process.
The military is also supposed to be ending its involvement in the myriad businesses that helped pay its bills in the past. It is revamping the organization of forces and is in the midst of a fundamental rewriting of military doctrine and strategy.
Despite all these traumas, the military put on an impressively precise show today, even if it seemed from another era. "The 50th anniversary was a special occasion," Mr. Zhang said. "I think this is probably the last parade of this type."

HEADLINE: Auto Makers Finish Record Year on Strong Note

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Customers drawn by hefty rebates bought more than 16 million new cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks in the 1999 model year, breaking the sales record set in 1986.
"These are good times," said Roy S. Roberts, group vice president for sales, service and marketing for the General Motors Corporation, which had its best model-year results in a decade. "The combination of affordable vehicles, high employment and buying momentum continues to propel us to record levels." 
 Most auto makers reported strong September sales today, closing out the 1999 model year on a strong note.
Sales reported for the model year, which traditionally runs through the end of September, so far total about 16.3 million vehicles, already surpassing the 1986 sales record of 15.8 million, said James W. Bush, publisher of Ward's Automotive Reports. That tally does not include September sales for the Ford Motor Company, the second-largest auto maker, which is scheduled to announce its results on Monday.
"The economy is strong, and increasingly the auto companies are buying the sales with aggressive incentive programs, and they can afford to do that because of their continued success in containing costs," Mr. Bush said. The incentives, offered by many auto makers, come in the form of rebates, discounted financing and cheap monthly payments on leases.
General Motors said its sales for the 1999 model year totaled 5,006,076 cars and trucks, a 9 percent increase over 1998. However, the company turned in mixed results for September today. Its overall sales for the month rose 8.9 percent compared with the same period a year ago, with its sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks jumping 30.2 percent because of strong sales of full-sized pickups and sport utility vehicles. But its car sales dropped 6.4 percent.
The DaimlerChrysler Corporation said sales for its Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth and Jeep brands hit a record 2,651,090 for the 1999 model year, up 8 percent from 1998. For the month of September, sales for those brands rose 7.3 percent. Car sales rose 4.9 percent and truck sales rose 8.4 percent. Small cars, small pickups and minivans turned in weak showings, but larger sedans and sport utility vehicles sold briskly.
The company's Mercedes-Benz unit saw its sales rise 9.6 percent, largely because of the continued popularity of its M-class sport utility vehicle and its E320 sedans.
Analysts expect Ford, which has been selling fewer discounted cars to rental fleets this year than last year, to report Monday that its sales fell 2 to 4 percent in September. George M. Pipas, Ford's manager for sales analysis, said that for the industry as a whole, 1999 was "easily the best model year in history." The auto industry is also expected to sell more cars this calendar year than in any previous year.
Toyota sold 1,465,399 cars and trucks in the 1999 model year, up 13.2 percent from the year before. The company said its September sales rose 10.4 percent, with strong sales of its bread-and-butter Camry sedan, its Tundra pickup truck and its Sienna minivan. Car sales rose 4.2 percent, while truck sales rose 20.6 percent. "Nine months of sustained industry growth has surprised everyone," said Jim Press, executive vice president of Toyota's American unit.
Wall Street analysts earlier this week scrambled to revise their estimates for industry sales upward. On Wednesday, John A. Casesa of Merrill Lynch raised his estimate for the year's sales from 16.2 million to 16.6 million. David B. Healy of Burnham Securities raised his estimate from 16.6 million to 16.8 million, well above last year's 15.6 million.
Honda sold a record 1,067,468 cars and trucks in the 1999 model year, up 7.4 percent from 1998. Honda's September sales rose 9.7 percent from the period a year earlier. The increase was a result of strong sales of the Odyssey minivan and the Accord and Acura TL sedans. Honda's car sales rose 3.8 percent, while its truck sales jumped 42.1 percent.
Nissan sold 653,771 cars and trucks in the 1999 model year, up 4.6 percent from the year before. The company said its September sales rose 19.8 percent last month, with car sales up 12.7 percent and truck sales up 29.3 percent. The increase came from strong sales of the Xterra sport utility vehicle, Quest minivan and Maxima and Altima sedans, and from sales in the Infiniti luxury division.
Other auto makers also reported strong September sales today. Volkswagen sales rose 52.3 percent in September compared with 1998, and the company said it had already sold more cars this year than it did in all of 1998. Subaru said its sales rose 17 percent for the month, while Isuzu's sales went up 55.7 percent, Mitsubishi's increased by 36 percent and Land Rover's rose 60.8 percent for the period.
Hyundai said its sales rose 82.5 percent in September. Audi said its sales rose 60.2 percent.
While G.M.'s truck sales were strong in September, its car sales dwindled. falling below the levels of the last two years. The decline at G.M. came even though overall demand for autos has hit record levels this year, and is far higher than in the last two years. G.M. sold 214,499 cars in September, down from 229,168 in September 1998 and 236,902 in September 1997.
Mr. Roberts of G.M. said the decline was partly a result of shortages of several all-new models that factories are just beginning to turn out, and partly because of the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans. Analysts said that lower car sales partly reflected the lingering effects of a strike last year that virtually shut G.M. for two months and led it to turn away would-be buyers, and partly reflected how unpopular the company's cars are, particularly when most auto makers are offering generous rebates.
"There is a market share war on," Mr. Casesa of Merrill Lynch said. "At almost any price, their cars are difficult to sell."

Stocks Continue to Slide On Strong Economic News
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was flat, rising 0.10 point, to 1,282.81. The index is up 4.36 this year and had been down 10.6 percent this week from its July 16 high, putting it into what Wall Street defines as a correction -- a selloff of 10 percent or more. 
 Other market gauges resumed their slide after reports showed that the economy's surging growth has not slowed in recent months. The data renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates next week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.95 points, to 10,273, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.31 points, to 2,736.85. Page C3.
 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.13 percent from 6.04 percent Thursday. C3.
 
City's Millennium Bookings Are Slow
Bookings for the New Year's holiday have been slow in New York, and there is at least the possibility that for hoteliers, restaurateurs and impresarios, the party to end this or any other century may turn out to be a bit of a bust. A new survey by the agency that oversees the city's tourism efforts, NYC & Company, finds that three-quarters of the 40 hotels that responded are not yet fully booked. A1.
 
Aetna Names Liaison to Doctors
Health insurer Aetna named a division president, John Kelly, director of the company's new office of physician relations to help bolster its ties with doctors. The creation of the unit comes after the American Medical Association, among others, objected to Aetna's $1 billion purchase of the Prudential Insurance Company of America's health-insurance unit in August, saying it would hurt competition in the managed health care market. C4.
 
Manufacturing Grew in September
The manufacturing sector grew in September much more strongly than expected, while prices of raw materials soared to the highest level in more than four years. The report by the National Association of Purchasing Management confirms that industry is recovering from the Asian financial crisis and provides further evidence that the economy rebounded from a sluggish second quarter. C3.
 
Euro Ends Week Up 3.6% at $1.07
The euro, the common currency adopted in January by 11 European nations, jumped 3.6 percent this week. It reached $1.0767 in European foreign-exchange trading, its highest level in eight weeks, before settling in New York at $1.0728. European central bankers have turned hawkish in the last few days, warning that inflationary pressure might be rising again and that it might well be necessary to cool things down with an increase in interest rates. Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president, said Europe's outlook for growth had improved and dangers to price stability should not be overlooked. C2.
 
Joint Venture Guidelines Proposed
The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission published proposed guidelines for joint ventures among businesses, indicating the sorts of agreements that do not violate Federal antitrust laws. The guidelines are subject to comment for 90 days, after which time the agencies will decide whether to modify or approve them. C2.
 
Kellogg to Buy Vegetarian Specialist
Kellogg plans to buy vegetarian food maker Worthington Foods for $307 million. Worthington's shares shot up 60 percent, gaining $8.6875, to $23.0625, in Nasdaq trading. Worthington Foods specializes in manufacturing and marketing products like vegetarian burgers and meatless sausage, chicken and hot dog products. C3.
 
Ecuadorean Repayment Is Sought

HEADLINE: The Battle of Brooklyn

 BODY:
The chaotic nature of the debate over the "Sensation" exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art must not obscure the two big issues involved. They have to do with the ground rules for government financing of cultural institutions and the political censorship of constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.
Reasonable people can disagree about spending tax money to support the arts, but both Congress, by funding the National Endowment for the Arts, and the city government, by funding a variety of museums and programs, have made the political decision to authorize such expenditures. We support that approach wholeheartedly, believing support for the arts is essential to both the intellectual climate and economy of New York City. We also believe, as a matter of law and constitutional principle, that once the financial support has been granted, as it has been for years, the institutions must be free to spend it according to their own professional standards. Otherwise, citizens will continually face situations like the current one in which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has turned a gut reaction into a destructive, punitive policy. 
 The Supreme Court has addressed this foundation of principle in a way that is not totally satisfactory, but that sheds an interesting light on the current situation. The justices affirmed the right of Congress to set "advisory" standards of decency for programs receiving grants. But the high court warned against pulling back or denying money already allocated because of the content of the works being exhibited.
A majority of New Yorkers seem to have a clear understanding of this principle. To be sure, many citizens of conscience find parts of the Brooklyn exhibition repugnant, and it is understandable that many Roman Catholics would find Chris Ofili's image of the Virgin Mary offensive. Others would agree with our colleague William Safire that while the Brooklyn Museum has a right to show what it likes, the administrators have been clumsy or needlessly provocative. Yet a Daily News poll shows that the majority of New Yorkers support the museum over Mayor Giuliani by a ratio of two to one. Those numbers show a broad-based support for New York's role as the nation's cultural capital. The people understand intuitively what Mr. Giuliani ignores for political gain. A museum is obliged to challenge the public as well as to placate it, or else the museum becomes a chamber of attractive ghosts, an institution completely disconnected from art in our time.
Next week, the battle will move to the courts. To support the Mayor's claim that the museum violated its lease, the city's lawyers have concocted several theories. The city argues that the museum broke its lease by conspiring with an auction house to inflate the value of a private art collection at the expense of the museum's public purpose. The city also argues that the museum violated its public mission by deciding to charge a fee and to exclude children under 17. We are confident the court will see the city's arguments for what they are -- a pretext to justify the Mayor's anger at a museum that dared to defend artistic freedom.

HEADLINE: In 'Boom,' More Lint Lines Pockets of Poor

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
From the vantage point of his college major, business administration, and his current calling, homelessness, Jesse Martin offered his considered summary of the latest Federal findings on the booming economy.
"Basically, the statistics mean the Bill Gateses get the money -- there's the boom," Mr. Martin said, more stoic than resentful as he counted as riches his barracks-bed existence inside the Community for Creative Non-Violence, a shelter housing 600 poor men, women and children six blocks from the Capitol. 
 "And the poor, they go like the song -- just getting poorer," Mr. Martin continued, citing all manner of real-life experience of his 60 years -- lately a heart attack without benefit of health insurance -- to confirm the fresh data of the bureaucrats. "Of course the gap is widening. Whoever got the money, that's who continues to get it."
Across the capital city's underside, where social workers say the most noticeable boom lately is the growing population of needy homeless women with children, impoverished Americans easily confirmed today the bleak footnote to the new Census Bureau report on the rising incomes of America. For all the boom, income inequality continues apace, the Government concluded, with the gap between the rich and the poor failing to narrow despite the record prosperity in the late 90's in the middle and upper social reaches.
"None of that surprises me," said Patricia Smith, a care-worn, determinedly optimistic 49-year-old grandmother deep in poverty. Ms. Smith, surviving on a patchwork of welfare and workfare, charity and volunteer labor, recently learned that the four grandchildren she found herself forced to nurture on the city's streets all last winter would soon be joined by a fifth.
"My two daughters are on drugs and one of them is pregnant again," explained Ms. Smith, quietly alarmed at this growth indicator in her role as the drug-free, court-appointed guardian of the children of her addicted daughters.
In the world of Ms. Smith, drug addicts receiving what she considers overly generous Government assistance stir far more resentment than the rich Americans getting richer out there beyond her horizon. "The economy's plain," she said. "If you don't have money, you're not going to get anywhere. If you know somebody or if you're not on drugs, you get pushed aside."
"I know it's rough out there," she said, describing a harrowing three-month homeless period of bobbing and weaving with the children in the streets and back alleys because, she said, she could find no clear help from the city's antipoverty bureaucracy. "They said I had too many children for a shelter."
"This place saved me," Ms. Smith said at one of the city's charity bastions, Bread for the City and Zacchaeus Free Clinic. All about her, the monthly flow of 3,500 families seeking charity food baskets was particularly heavy at midday. The first of every month presses the poor to reach extra deep and seek out the center's basket donations as they wait for their regular cash and food-stamp dole to come around again.
"In the streets, I was washing the kids and changing their clothes behind bushes, and many people were kind to us," Ms. Smith said. She scowled at the memory of one man who she said talked of charity in return for sex with the oldest granddaughter. "I didn't have a life, never mind an economy."
In a nearby corridor, 25-year-old Patrina Swinson waited for some free-clinic care and scoffed at the boom and what she considers its incessant consultation as an ultimate barometer of life.
"My reality is not in stocks and bonds," Ms. Swinson said. "We're all still scraping around here, still at the bottom.
"My reality is in my neighborhood, not the economy," she said, proudly describing plans to learn computer technology to move beyond her job as a counselor in group homes for troubled teen-agers.
The economic boom's presence can be noted in the city's poorer neighborhoods in the form of land speculation and the razing of low-rent, if seedy, housing, in the view of Fred Henry, vice president of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, a private charity dating from the old antipoverty programs and Vietnam War protests of the 1960's.
"Developers are closing out a lot of poor people with their new emphasis on building middle-class housing," Mr. Henry said, citing this as a factor in the fastest-growing homeless category, women with children. Aside from that, he said, "Nothing has really changed across the last five years of economic boom."
Larry Weeks, a 42-year-old resident of the center, disabled after a series of odd jobs, has been working in the center kitchen school, aiming for a fresh start. "I listen to all the news a lot and usually go by what I hear," Mr. Weeks said.
"But if you're out there living the economy, you know it's not really booming," he said, describing his frustration in seeking $10-an-hour jobs and finding only $6 or $8 ones. "So what should be reported from here is hard times, lots of hard times."
A number of poor people interviewed emphasized that in the depths of unrelenting material troubles, they bolstered themselves on spiritual values.
Steven Sanders, a 35-year-old computer technician who said his life fell apart in addiction to crack cocaine, insisted he was back on the right track precisely because he had adopted the Bible, not the economy, as his guide.
"Oh, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, that's very true," Mr. Sanders said. "But I feel you can only be 'rich' in how you treat others in God's image and how you feel within."
He grinned at what he said was this obvious point being missed in the endless Government data and analysis about the boom and the state of national contentment.
"When the Bible says, 'To whom much is given much is required,' it's not really about the economy," Mr. Sanders said from his place in the homeless shelter, looking happily out of tune with the boom times.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Peril Is Over but Japanese Anger Isn't

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKAIMURA, Japan, Oct. 1

 BODY:
For years, Tomi Oshiro lived practically in the shadows of this town's nuclear fuel plant, yet she, like most people in town, had no inkling of the perilous work going on inside the nondescript building.
The mystery ended abruptly on Thursday, when the fuel-reprocessing plant suffered the worst nuclear accident in Japanese history. Ms. Oshiro returned from shopping to find helicopters buzzing madly above her house. It was several hours later before she was warned of the full dimensions of the crisis. 
 "I am furious," she said, adding that "this incident was incomparably more serious" than previous accidents in the town, which is the home to more than a dozen nuclear research and production sites, including Japan's first nuclear power plant.
"It took place right next to people's houses," she said, "and still it took a long time before people were warned or any emergency measures were taken."
Ms. Oshiro spoke on a sidewalk less than hour after the Government declared that the danger had ended and told the 313,000 people living within a six-mile radius of the plant that they no longer needed to stay indoors.
Leaving her home for the first time in 24 hours, she expressed her profound distrust of the Government's handling of nuclear safety. But in Tokyo, some 90 miles away, senior officials labored to convey the impression of a return to normal.
"We believe that this should not lead to worries about the nation's nuclear policy," said Hiromu Nonaka, the chief cabinet secretary, who acknowledged the Government's slowness in handling the crisis but tried to allay concerns about the safety of nuclear power industry in Japan, anxieties held both inside and outside the country.
But with people like the townspeople here, those in civic groups around the country and independent experts in Tokyo, Government credibility had hit rock bottom, provoking cries for everything from abandoning the nuclear industry altogether to a sweeping overhaul of the industry, which provides nearly a third of Japan's electrical power.
Residents of Tokaimura interviewed by phone while barricaded in their homes, or caught on the street in the first minutes after the ban on going outside was lifted this afternoon, expressed their anger and disbelief that safety precautions could have been so lax and that the Government could have minimized the accident in the crucial first hours.
There was an accident two years ago that the town handled calmly, said Kazuko Hagiya, 52, the director of Tokai Hospital, just two miles from the plant. "We never realized the situation was so serious this time," he said. "I didn't close the windows right away. Some patients didn't know anything about the accident, and kept their windows open until they were warned, late in the afternoon."
Yukio Hosogai, a ruddy hospital refrigerator technician who was walking his dog, Hayato, said he learned of the accident in a call from his wife around noon, but was surprised to see civilian cars driving through the area two hours later.
As he spoke, walking in an abandoned roadway, dozens of white-suited nuclear clean-up workers combed the rice fields nearby, using Geiger counters to measure radiation levels.
"Honestly speaking, I will never get rid of the anxieties that come from living here," he said, "and if I could get rid of everything today and move somewhere else, I would. But I can't."
Residents of Tokaimura once thought the town of about 33,000 inhabitants had been lucky to become the home of Japan's nuclear industry, beginning in the 1950's. Before that, it had been a poor pearl in a string of what the Japanese call company castle towns, meaning towns dominated by a single corporation, in this case Hitachi.
First came the country's first nuclear lab, then its first reactor, then its first nuclear fuel-processing plants, and finally, its first breeder reactor, which uses plutonium rather than uranium fuel and is theoretically self-sustaining.
Little by little, residents in this coastal area -- with deep green rice fields, peaked tile-roofed houses and the country's characteristic commercial sprawl -- began to realize the costs related to the new industry.
This realization took root when there was a huge leak of radioactive coolant at the breeder plant in Tokaimura in 1995, and when there was a fire at another fuel-reprocessing plant two years later that exposed 37 workers to radiation.
 "A few of us tried to sound the alarms of danger from this industry starting way back," said Osamu Yatabe, a lawyer who once represented the district in the National Assembly.
"We were always in the minority though, because officials were able to convince people that accidents like Chernobyl and Three Mile Island could never happen here. Japan's safety precautions were in fact perfect, they said."
In Tokyo today, independent nuclear experts and civic groups ridiculed the Government's contention that the uncontrolled reaction, in a privately owned uranium-reprocessing plant, did not reflect on the overall safety of Japan's huge nuclear energy industry.
Even one senior official, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Kaoru Yosano, took exception to the prevailing official line, saying he was more concerned about "psychological damage" to the public than any economic impact.
"I am worried that the unthinkable critical accident may throw cold water on the public trust in nuclear facilities," he said.
One the most critical stances, though, came from Greenpeace Japan, which said it was starting a campaign to force the Government to phase out the nuclear industry.
Others may have stopped short of a demand like that, which has little prospect of being realized, but insisted on sweeping changes and were no less scathing in their dismissal of Government explanations of the crisis.
Asked about the Government's reassurances that the incident did not reflect on the country's entire nuclear industry, Kiyoshi Sakurai, a former researcher at the state-run Atomic Energy Research Institute said: "Nonsense. Safety management or operational management of other nuclear facilities has a lot in common with this plant -- that is, the system is designed in ways that allow workers to intervene easily in the process."
According to most accounts of the accident, a flash of blue light and a chain reaction of nuclear fission were produced when workers inside the plant put more than five times the amount of uranium in an acid solution-filled processing container than is normally allowed. Three of those workers are among the critically injured, altogether 49 people were exposed to radiation.
The reaction was eventually contained when emergency workers managed to break a drainage pipe for the container holding the fissionable material. Later, emergency crews doused the contaminated site with radiation-absorbing chemicals.
"Many in the public say that this accident must have been caused by a procedural infractions, but I do not buy that," said Keiji Koyabashi, a scientist at the Research Reactor Institute of Kyoto University.
"In nuclear power matters, there should always be fail-safes," he said. "Even if a mistake occurs, safety must be assured."

Chart: "DEFINITIONS: The Many Ways To Measure Radiation"
 
Scientists measure radiation released in an accident like the one in Tokaimura, Japan, in a variety of ways.
 
RADIATION
A roentgen is the most direct measure of radiation. It represents the number of atoms of a gas that have lost an electron and become charged by the radiation. This is usually expressed as roentgens per hour or roentgens per minute.
 
ABSORBED RADIATION
Matter, whether living or nonliving, absorbs energy as radiation penetrates its substance. This absorbed energy is expressed as a rad (roentgen absorbed dose) or a gray (Gy). One gray = 100 rads.
 
ITS EFFECT ON HUMANS
To measure the potential damage to human tissue, scientists created the roentgen equivalent man or rem as a unit of measure. It takes into account the amount absorbed and compensates for differences in types of radiation to arrive at a measure of potential harm.
 
The sievert (Sv) is a similar unit measure, with one sievert being equal to 100 rem. Both are usually expressed as one one-thousandth of a whole unit, for example as millirem and milliseivert.
 
TYPICAL EXPOSURE
Average annual background exposure to radiation for those living in the United States is about 360 millirem. This amount comes from naturally occurring radio-isotopes and medical applications.

HEADLINE: Veteran Asks That Memorial Honor Only War Dead

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Sept. 29

 BODY:
Tony Pia vividly remembers the morning almost 30 years ago when he saw workers dismantling a three-sided wooden structure inscribed with the names of almost 10,000 Stamford men and women who had served in World War II.
"I was stunned beyond belief," said Mr. Pia, whose own name was among those on the small white building that had stood in a small park opposite the Old Town Hall since 1943. "No one had been told this was going to happen." 
 Mr. Pia, a retired career Army sergeant and a longtime veterans' advocate here, gathered as many sections of the building as he could and took them to the basement of Town Hall. "Quite a few people who got wind of what I had done came in and got the nameplates with their names or the names of loved ones who had been killed," said Mr. Pia, known locally as the Old Sarge.
Now, Mr. Pia is upset again about another issue that involves honoring servicemen. He opposes a plaque honoring Peter J. Rowe, a Marine Corps brigadier general and Stamford native, that was placed in Veterans Memorial Park in 1997, a year after the general was killed in an auto accident in California.
It was mainly through Mr. Pia's efforts that the park, in downtown Stamford, not far from where the dismantled building stood, was created in 1977. Unlike the old structure, which gave way to neglect and then to urban renewal, the new memorial does not name all of Stamford's veterans, but commemorates the nearly 300 servicemen from the city who were killed in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
It is the breach of that standard for inclusion on the memorial that has Mr. Pia so upset. "The entire park is dedicated to servicemen who died while fighting for their country," he said. "And General Rowe did not die during a war. He was killed in an automobile accident." Mr. Pia has asked the city's Board of Representatives to have the plaque removed, setting off a debate. The board has not yet announced a decision.
The Parks and Recreation Commission, which has jurisdiction over the park, one of the largest veterans' memorials in the Northeast, recommended recently that the board turn down the request.
"We feel that the plaque is in an area of the park that is not hallowed ground," said Stephen P. Lesandro, the chairman of the commission, which approved the plaque honoring General Rowe. "It was placed unobtrusively, away from the memorials."
But Mr. Lesandro's explanation does not satisfy Mr. Pia. Geno Lupinacci, who designed the park's 22-foot-high granite war memorial with all the deceased veterans' names inscribed on it, and several veterans' organizations have also asked that the plaque be removed. "I designed the monument for those killed in wars," said Mr. Lupinacci, a World War II veteran who has operated a monument business in Stamford for 52 years. "A plaque for the general doesn't belong on that sacred ground."
Those who proposed and paid for the plaque honoring General Rowe disagree. "How many generals come out of small towns like Stamford?" asked Pasquale Battinelli, the director of the city's Patriotic and Special Events Commission, who is a former marine and was one of those responsible for the plaque. "After he died, I said, 'We've got to do something nice for this guy, who served in Vietnam and Desert Storm.' "
Not many people in Stamford seem to remember General Rowe, who left town as a young man to join the Marine Corps and never returned. One of those who does remember him is Frank LiVolsi, a Stamford lawyer who was instrumental in having the plaque placed in the park. "Pete Rowe served his country well and deserved the plaque," said Mr. LiVolsi, who was an Army captain in Vietnam and knew General Rowe when they were teen-agers in Stamford. "His name is not on the memorial, so we see nothing wrong with this."
Mainly because of the precedent set by the plaque honoring General Rowe, a veterans' group wants to similarly honor another Stamford native who attained the rank of general and died after he retired.
The group, the 192d Field Artillery Battalion Association, which is based in Stamford, has asked the Parks and Recreation Commission for permission to erect a plaque for Army Brigadier Gen. Edward W. Berry, who commanded the battalion during the Korean War.
"I didn't know that someone who didn't die during a war was allowed in Veterans Park," said Francis B. DeMasi, the group's chairman, who served under General Berry, "but since the Marines have one of their generals in there, why can't we? And besides being an outstanding military leader, General Berry was a great educator, who spent 39 years at Wright Technical School in Stamford after he retired from service."

HEADLINE: Budget Surplus Is Expected

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
A slowdown in the state's economic growth is expected to produce a modest budget surplus, the State Comptroller, Nancy Wyman, said yesterday.
In her monthly estimate, Ms. Wyman said the state should have a surplus of $11.2 million for fiscal year 2000. Ms. Wyman said second-quarter job growth increased at its slowest pace since 1995. Other economic markers declined, she said. 
 Income tax revenues account for half the projected surplus. Last year the tax produced 70 percent of the record-setting $620 million surplus. When lawmakers were finished appropriating extra funding, remaining surplus was $69.3 million surplus for the year that ended June 30.

HEADLINE: We Don't Need A New Subway Line

BYLINE: By Diana Fortuna; Diana Fortuna is president of the Citizens Budget Commission.

 BODY:
Capital improvements planned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should accomplish two things: reduce crowding on the subways during rush hour and support economic expansion by accommodating more workers bound for midtown Manhattan. By these criteria, the agency's plan for the Second Avenue subway is either too much or too little.
In its new capital budget, the M.T.A. plans to spend $700 million over five years to begin the subway, which will extend only from 125th Street to 63d Street. If the goal is to reduce crowding, this project, which is projected to cost a total of $3.4 billion, is an extraordinarily expensive way to achieve it. If the goal is to increase the city's ability to bring workers from the other boroughs into Manhattan, then a more extensive project is needed. 
 Yes, crowding on the Lexington Avenue subway line is a serious problem. But it is a problem chiefly during rush hours. The problem could be fixed by running more trains during that period. The time between trains on the Lexington Avenue and other crowded subway lines now averages more than two minutes. Some other large cities can run trains 90 seconds apart. If the M.T.A. could operate this well, then the capacity of lines would increase by one-third, from 30 to 40 trains per hour. Crowding, as we know it, would end on all lines, not just on the Lexington Avenue trains.
Seems simple enough. What's the holdup? First, the M.T.A. cannot reduce the time between trains because it relies on outdated signaling systems. The authority has spent $33 billion on capital improvements since 1982, but the signals have been neglected, and technological innovations have not been introduced. The agency's capital plan would spend $642 million to upgrade the current system, but it would be wise to invest more in new signals.
There is another problem in running trains closer together: getting New Yorkers in and out of cars quickly. But this should not be an insurmountable task; other cities have managed to do it. The M.T.A. should investigate other, less expensive changes, like new subways cars with bigger doors and alterations to station platforms and entrances. In addition, riders are less likely to fight to get on a train if they are confident another is right behind.
Peak-hour pricing is another way to reduce crowding. Commuter railroads already give discounts to riders during off hours; trying it on the subways could encourage many riders to shift from the busiest hours to less crowded times, say 7:30 A.M. instead of 8:15. To this end, MetroCard could revamp its discount policy. Instead of giving riders a 10 percent volume discount at all times, it could limit the discount to off-peak hours. And employers would have to show some flexibility.
Other options are yet to be tried. For instance, why not create dedicated lanes, blocked off by barriers, for rush-hour express bus service on First and Second Avenues?
Accommodating the city's future job growth is a harder problem to solve. Nobody has a reliable crystal ball that shows how many people will be working in Manhattan in 20, 30 or 40 years. The current boom could push employment well above the record high achieved in 1969. Or a national recession, changes on Wall Street and other unpredictable events could reduce the number of city workers.
If the number of jobs keeps growing, the Second Avenue subway, even if it were extended to the Lower East Side, would not help. It doesn't accomplish what's necessary: bringing commuters from the other boroughs and suburbs to Manhattan. In this regard, the East Side Connector, which would extend subway lines into Queens and add a new Long Island Rail Road tunnel to Grand Central Terminal, is a far more sensible element of the capital plan.
If money is to be raised for expanded service, let's reject another futile compromise and instead design the right project, one that will carry New York into the next century.

Knockdown
 The Harrowing True Account of a Yacht Race Turned Deadly.
 By Martin Dugard.
 Illustrated. 243 pp. New York:
 Pocket Books. $24.95. 
 We have entered the age of celebrity weather: from the 1996 Mount Everest megastorm immortalized in Jon Krakauer's "Into Thin Air," to the wicked nor'easter that wrecked a fishing fleet in Sebastian Junger's "Perfect Storm" to the Southern Ocean monster that forced three rescues (and led to as many books) in the 1996-97 Vendee Globe around-the-world sailing race, blockbuster disasters have become our most reliable best sellers. Or so several publishers are hoping, as they rush to print accounts of the last December's tragic Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race. And none were more hastily published than Martin Dugard's "Knockdown." It is as messy as the storm that inspired it -- a melodramatic but nonetheless riveting chronicle of the "weather bomb" that hit the race fleet just as it entered Australia's treacherous Bass Strait last Dec. 27. In the mayhem that followed, 100-mile-per-hour winds churned up waves eight stories high, 24 boats were crushed and abandoned, 57 sailors were rescued and six men died.
Dugard's epic tragedy begins as most do, the audience watching with grim foreknowledge as the boats sail merrily to their doom, sails flapping against a clear sky as they round Sydney Harbor's South Head and enter the open sea. The fleet is 115 strong, from hulking maxis like Sayonara, owned by the Silicon Valley mogul Larry Ellison, to local family-owned and -crewed yachts like the 35-foot Midnight Rambler to the legendary 52-foot Winston Churchill, a restored wooden veteran of the first Sydney-to-Hobart in 1945. Herein lies the uniquely Aussie appeal of the 735-mile race, an epic haul billed by Dugard as the Everest of the sea: unlike other blue-water races, the Sydney-to-Hobart allows amateur weekend sailors to compete alongside multinational racing syndicates, the local skippers in their smaller boats often proving the toughest of the bunch. As Dugard convincingly tells it, this traditional Australian nautical grit contributed to last December's debacle. The Sydney-to-Hobart's grueling conditions and awful seas are points of national pride, and so by the time many skippers decided to turn back, it was too late -- they were in the eye of the storm. The question that still hovers over the ill-fated race is why on earth didn't somebody call it off. Dugard does a fine job of outlining the brewing of disaster: the wind and wave patterns of the Bass Strait, the convergence of three weather systems in those shallow waters and the weather bureau's undertstated forecasts, broadcast despite one meteorologist breaking down in tears when he saw the report. In an eerie twist, on real-time Internet broadcasts on sites like Quokka and MountainZone, armchair adventurers, privy to this impending Armageddon, as one forecaster called it, tuned in to watch the nautical horror show unfold.
Dugard, a former marketing coordinator who left his job in 1993 to write full time, is making a career of machismo. His previous book, "Surviving the Toughest Race on Earth," chronicles his participation in the ludicrously punishing Raid Gauloises team adventure race. A biographical note on the dust jacket of "Knockdown" says the author is a "co-holder of the Around the World Speed Record (New York to New York in 31 hours, 28 minutes)," but leaves out the fact that he set that record as a passenger on the Concorde. Duggard's writing is fittingly macho. On the growing storm: "The wind is not a gentle tickle on the cheek, but a brooding schizophrenic that can instantaneously destroy." On the father of the Midnight Rambler's Ed Psaltis: He "was the sort of decisive man of the sea lesser men dreamed of becoming." And on the role of skipper: "He's playing chess with the gods out there, with his life and the lives of his men the tariff." But strip away Dugard's chest-thumping voice-over, and you are left with a story that simply won't let go. With rogue waves smashing hatches and snatching men from the decks, with severed fingers and crushed eye sockets and with shredded life rafts and unbelievably daring rescues, readers won't mind repetitive detail, abruptly spliced anecdotes from landlubbers and occasionally sloppy prose. What might bother them is his mind reading. Dugard's tale is more vivid for its detailed forays into each surviving racer's emotions. But he makes grand leaps into fiction when he offers the blow-by-blow thoughts of several drowning men: the British Olympic sailor Glyn Charles "is able to appreciate the sky and waves and wind with the love of a lifelong sailor up until the very end. Finally, his limbs no longer moving, his mind knowing contentment after a life of rage and battle, Glyn Charles slips beneath the waves one last time."
Charles, with five other surely undeserving men, was one of the losers in the Sydney-to-Hobart race. But like the disasters before it, this tragedy offers more than its share of ordinary heroes: severely injured old friends stoically clinging to the remnants of a Winston Churchill life raft for 28 hours, the rookie rescue swimmers Michelle Blewitt and Kristy McAlister diving again and again into cold black water to save the entire crew of Stand Aside. Others must live with their actions, like the crew of the Margaret Rintoul II, the boat that passed the sinking Sword of Orion as Charles drowned. And like those disasters before it, Sydney-to-Hobart raises questions about the lure of adventure and the economics of risk. The final rescue price tag was $650,000 in civil resources alone. The Australian Military and Safety Authority continues to be responsible for 29 million square miles of dangerous ocean. More and more people seek out such elemental trials as climbing Everest, sailing the Southern Ocean or tackling Australia's toughest sailing race. As Dugard quotes one of the Sydney race organizers, "I expect the problems we experienced will make the race all the more attractive." And no doubt Dugard's book, too.

HEADLINE: Books in Brief: Fiction;
Material Girl

BYLINE: By Barbara Sutton 

 BODY:
Hooking up with a winner is the only maneuver that Rita Zapata, the protagonist of Yxta Maya Murray's second novel, WHAT IT TAKES TO GET TO VEGAS (Grove, $24), can envision to gain her some respect within her East Los Angeles community. As Rita acknowledges in Murray's streetwise narrative, when at 16 you've already been written off as scandalous by the community's all-powerful and viper-tongued Latina League, your only recourse is to snag a good man. And in the impoverished Mexican-American culture in which Rita comes of age, this means a boxer who's got what it takes to land a pay-per-view prizefight in Vegas. After sleeping with and being ditched by most of the neighborhood's going-nowhere-fast street fighters, Rita sets her sights on Billy Navarro, a charming but brutal boxer from Mexico, and the plot traces the pair's heavy-breathing but precarious relationship. Despite the selfishness behind Rita's repeated missteps, we're touched by how ignorantly she desires the consumer goods that she associates with respectability -- from custom-interior Cadillacs to the complimentary bottles of fancy shampoo you in get in your room at Caesars Palace. After a while, however, Rita's upbeat though fated-for-deflation epiphanies become taxing, as does the incongruity of street language spiked with more "literary" metaphors. And the story's resolution, after episodes of violence that unfold like a television movie, has a recovery element that is at odds with the rest of the novel. Still, Rita's narrative maintains a fast clip, and the novel's strength lies in Murray's candid though poignant description of the "Eastelayer" world -- of the bustling consumerismo of Cesar Chvez Avenue, of boxing champions whose personal mythologies are memorized by every schoolchild, of the sad-sack lives of wannabe boxers who wind up working at Denny's.

BYLINE: By Bruce Gottlieb; Bruce Gottlieb was a staff writer at Slate magazine until enrolling in Harvard Law School this fall.

 BODY:
"Would you like to see how to knock someone off the Web?" Silicosis asks.
Sili, as he is known, is a slim young man with serious eyes set deeply into a delicate face. He's the newest member of a hacker collective known as L0pht (pronounced "loft"). He becomes visibly uncomfortable when asked to talk about himself. He gives his age as "mid-20's" and then clams up. But when the conversation moves to hacking, Sili turns voluble: "I think it's a thrill to look at a program and figure out how to make that program do something that it was never designed to do in the first place. There's the challenge."
We sit down at a computer monitor while Sili explains his latest discovery. By mimicking messages that typically flow between computers on a network, he can reach out to almost anyone running Windows 95, 98 or 2000 in a large corporate environment, or anyone using a cable modem, and forcibly disconnect them from the Web. In a demonstration of this, he types a one-line command on his computer and hits the return key with a flourish. Sure enough, the computer across the room, which seconds before had been connected to M.I.T.'s server, is now off line. The same technique, Sili explains, can be used to take information flowing between the Web and your neighbor's computer and reroute it into your own. A clever hacker could capture a neighbor's banking transactions, passwords or credit-card information.
Sili published his research on L0pht's Web site in mid-August. The report was covered in the computer publication Infoworld and the on-line magazine ZDNet. At the time, a Microsoft spokesman, instead of denouncing L0pht, expressed the hope to reporters that the group would "design a more secure version of the protocol" -- a hackerproof set of operating instructions for the computer.
This request strikes Sili as especially outrageous. "Why doesn't Ralph Nader just redesign the Corvair?" he asks.
Nader is something of a role model at L0pht, a confederation of eight young hackers who position themselves, incredibly enough, as a consumer-advocacy group. But L0pht's tactics are a bit unorthodox: breaking into software systems and then posting instructions on how to do so on the Web, where they can be picked up by software designers and malicious hackers alike. Intrigued, I paid a visit to their workshop.
L0pht's "laboratory" is the second floor of a ramshackle warehouse in suburban Boston. Predictably, the door to the lab has a sign for the pizza man -- "Domino's Knock Loudly."
The eight men who make up L0pht allow themselves to be identified only by their screen names: Dr. Mudge, Space Rogue, Dildog, Brian Oblivion, Kingpin, Silicosis, Weld Pond and John Tan. They look to be in their 20's or 30's, but their six-room suite is an adolescent geek's fantasy clubhouse. One wall is papered with antiquated circuit boards while another has a signed picture from Julie, Penthouse Pet. Junk food in the cupboard is taken seriously. There are three different kinds of Cheez-Its: hot and spicy, plain and white cheddar.
The warehouse brims with more than 200 computers ranging from state-of-the-art Sun and Digital workstations to nostalgia pieces like Commodore 64's and Apple IIe's. Black cables, yellow cables and jumbles of thin rainbow-colored wires drip from the ceiling, all jacked in to steel racks of oscilloscopes, radio transmitters, D.S.L. modems, I.S.D.N. modems, half-opened C.P.U.'s and a 50-foot roof antenna. The warehouse also contains several small-scale dummy computer networks.
L0pht's "research" consists of trying to break into these internal systems. Upon discovering a security flaw in commercial-network software, the L0phties publish an advisory on their Web site. The advisory is a double-edged sword: a detailed description of the flaw -- enough information for other hackers to duplicate the "exploit" -- and a solution that tells network administrators how to close the loophole.
L0pht's unorthodox methods have garnered praise from very unlikely quarters. Sixteen months ago, L0pht appeared before the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the United States Senate. Senator Fred Thompson introduced L0pht not as a "gang" nor even a "group," but, translating for Washington pols, as a "hacker think tank."
L0pht wowed the committee by reeling off an alarming list of security holes in public and private systems. After the presentation, Senator Lieberman gushed, "It is probably not what you came to hear, but actually, I think you are performing an act of very good citizenship and I appreciate it." Lieberman went on to compare L0pht, in a single sentence, to both Rachel Carson and Paul Revere. "You are performing a valuable service to your country," Thompson added, "and we appreciate that and want you to continue."
The National Security Council is equally bullish on L0pht. I met the N.S.C.'s director of information protection, Jeffrey Hunker, at Defcon, an annual three-day "conference" attracting more than 2,000 computer hackers from around the country. Hunker had come to talk about President Clinton's initiatives on computer security (and to spy on hackers, if you believe the whispers). He surprised me by raving about the group's technical sophistication. "L0pht has carved out an interest-ing niche for itself," he added, "and for similar-minded people -- white-hatted hackers. Their objective is basically to help improve the state of the art in security and to be a gadfly, so to speak -- to identify products that have vulnerabilities and make certain those vulnerabilities get fixed."
When I told L0pht about Hunker's comments, they rolled their eyes, saying, "You're not going to publish that, are you?"
For one thing, they had no wish to be identified as favorites of the N.S.C., since that might jeopardize their standing among so-called black-hat, or malicious, hackers. "We are all extremely ethical and moral," one member allowed, "but we're not white-hat hackers. We have our own moral and ethical standards" -- the term is gray-hat.
It's not hard to spot the reasons for the moral ambiguity. In their off hours, Mudge and Dildog are members of Cult of the Dead Cow, a black-hat hacker group that recently released Back Orifice 2000 (bo2k), a computer program that enables a hacker to control another computer from afar. (The name is a crude play on Microsoft's Back Office Server, a program that allows a legitimate administrator to, among other things, control another computer on a network.) But unlike Back Office, bo2k is "invisible," meaning that a hacker can spy on another user, even change files, without the user's knowledge. Dildog, one of bo2k's authors, euphemistically describes it as "a shy program." Jason Garms, the former head of Microsoft's security-response team, is a bit more direct, labeling b02k "a malicious program, with malicious intent."
Perhaps because of their ties to the black-hat community, L0pht members refuse to be identified, although they will let themselves be photographed. As Space Rogue explains (and any hacker knows), pictures are next to useless if you're trying to dig up private data on someone.
When L0pht testified before the Senate, members would not accept checks for hotel and travel expenses. As with members of the Witness Protection Program who have come before the Senate, they were reimbursed with cash. Senator John Glenn even signed pictures -- with the group's screen names: "To Dr. Mudge. . . . To Space Rogue. . . . To Weld Pond."
"Open up the raincoat to expose all the little parts," is how Mudge, smiling, describes L0pht's ethos. Mudge will not disclose his age, but mid-30's seems a good guess. He claims a college degree in music with further course work in computer science. Mudge says that early experimenting with computers led to informal warnings from certain "three-letter agencies." He wears his hair below his shoulders, sports a goatee and favors faded jeans and a T-shirt. In his Senate testimony he claimed to have given training seminars at NASA and the National Security Agency.
Mudge frankly admits that he'll answer anyone's technical questions about hacking. "If a black hat approaches us and says, Hey, this is the project or problem I'm looking at . . . we'll talk to them, no problem. And if a government agency approaches us and says, How do you do this, or, How does this work, we'll talk to them."
Of course, this laissez-faire attitude has its costs. Mudge says: "Full disclosure is something we had to grapple with for a long time. The flip side is that critics say, 'You're giving people tools that can actually do bad things.' That is absolutely true. It's got a lot of nasty side effects."
For instance: last December, a hacker magazine called Phrack disclosed a flaw in a network program called Cold Fusion. (Network programs help manage computers that are linked together). In April of this year, Weld Pond -- an older, thoughtful L0pht programmer -- discovered a second, more serious way to exploit the flaw.
Weld immediately published an advisory on L0pht.com prescribing a fix. Weld's report also contained enough detail to explain the flaw to so-called "script kiddies" -- young, malicious hackers with limited technical expertise who are among the most avid readers of L0pht's advisories. In the span of three weeks, according to PC Week, hackers inserted bogus text and images on at least 100 Cold Fusion systems, including those of NASA, the Army and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
So why didn't L0pht contact Allaire, the small Cambridge, Mass., software firm that makes Cold Fusion, before releasing an advisory? The reason, say Weld and the other L0phties, is that vendors usually sweep tips from hackers under the rug. Vendors, claims L0pht, don't want customers to think software has flaws. "We were trained by the vendors to go public," says Mudge, "to give them a black eye."
With an attitude like this, it's tempting to blame Weld Pond, especially since L0pht's advisory led to more security breaches than would have occurred had nothing ever been reported. It's not enough to claim, as Weld does, that "We try to stay somewhat neutral -- we're not on the vendor's side, we're not on the hacker's side. When we release the tools, they can be used for good or bad. It's up to the individuals to have morals."
Mudge is currently writing a paper on a longtime hobbyhorse of his: the vulnerability of electrical power grids to hacker attacks. While the computers that control these power grids are not directly connected to the Internet, Mudge thinks a hacker could still turn out the nation's lights because utility companies have left the keys to their computers under the proverbial doormat.
Mudge tells me that careless utility employees often put internal documents on public servers -- perhaps to access them from home or while on the road. Sometimes, Mudge claims, the documents explain how to access the central computers. Central computers "might have no attachment to the Internet," he says, "other than the fact that somebody put up a document on the Internet describing how to get to it and how to use it." Mudge pauses. "Well, that's just as good."
Mudge has written a program to scan utility companies' Web sites for words like "confidential" or "password." "I'm not breaking any laws by doing this, I'm just grabbing public stuff," he is quick to point out. "They don't realize that they're putting it up there for the world to see."
He shows me a file downloaded from a large utility company that contains a presentation on company security. Next he opens a file full of phone numbers from another utility company. "It sounds almost science-fictionist," he cautions, "but with these numbers here I'd be able to turn off their entire grid." The phone numbers, he explains, connect to modems linked to the central switches that determine where electricity flows. "If I don't publish this information," Mudge claims, "someone else will come along and do the same thing, with less ethical goals. Now you can see a situation where people are dying because of these corporations' stupidity. At that point, who's to blame?"
Given the stakes, Mudge intends to relax his commitment to so-called full disclosure. "It's uncool," he says, for utility companies to "learn about a problem by reading it in the newspaper." That's why he plans to alert companies in advance, so they can close vulnerabilities before the news is made public on L0pht's Web site.
Like Nader, the L0pht members can get a bit preachy on the subject of ethics. "Any of us could leave L0pht right now and take six-figure jobs," Mudge says. "The fact that we don't and we're on the ramen-noodle, mac-and-cheese diet, that speaks for our ethics right there. It's not a job for us; this is what drives us through life."
While Mudge's self-righteousness may be justified up to a point, there are also more prosaic reasons for working at L0pht. Freedom to do whatever you want, for instance. Silicosis and Brian Oblivion are installing a motor-driven satellite dish on the warehouse roof. They hope to capture ground-to-space communications from the Space Shuttle and high-resolution images of the earth broadcast from satellites. The justification? It's cool. Silicosis adds, "It impresses my girlfriend."
Space Rogue -- a sort of young Archie Bunker figure, to the extent that an Archie Bunker figure can be young -- sticks closer to earth when asked how he ended up at L0pht. "I did one semester in college, said the hell with this and got out. Controlled learning environments have never been my strong point." L0pht gave him a place to pursue projects at his own pace.
Mostly, Space Rogue seems to like L0pht for the camaraderie. "I moved to Boston in 1990," he says, "and I almost immediately met all these people on line on local bulletin boards. L0pht started shortly thereafter in fall '91. So I'd already known these people awhile, even face to face. The on-line world at the time was very small."
Mudge recalls that the group took off when members moved their computers from their living rooms to a small loft space in Boston. (All but one of the founders, Brian Oblivion, have since left.) L0pht soon added members and moved to a larger suburban warehouse four years ago. It has also started a consulting business on the side called L0pht Heavy Industries.
L0pht is not without critics, of course. "While L0pht puts on the Robin Hood mantle of fighting the big computer companies," a senior programmer at Microsoft tells me, "their only victims are the little people that are customers" -- the people who purchase products like Windows 2000.
Microsoft has been on the business end of several L0pht advisories, most notably when Mudge and Weld demonstrated how to decrypt passwords from computers running Microsoft's NT operating system. Jason Garms, the former head of Microsoft's security-response team, admits that hackers have a role in creating secure software. But he's wary of the Darwinian notion that hackers will, by actively looking for flaws, expose inferior products. He likens it to improving public safety by painting a target on everyone's head.
I mentioned Garms's criticism to the L0pht members, who were equally dismissive. If gray-hat hackers stopped searching for vulnerabilities, L0pht believes, a black-hat hacker would find them sooner or later. It's better to get rid of flaws than hope no one finds them. The N.S.C.'s Hunker shares this belief -- the hackers are already out there" -- which is why he applauds L0pht for keeping vendors honest.
The senior Microsoft programmer also warns that Mudge and his colleagues, for all their highfalutin apologia, are motivated mostly by naked ego: "I am certain," he says, "that the primary motivation of these people is simple self-gratification and justification."
I asked the L0pht members whether ego played a part in their ethical reasoning. Weld Pond replied that, by assuming pseudonyms, they more or less deny themselves the benefits of celebrity. "When I walk down the street," he says, "no one knows I'm Weld Pond."
But at Defcon, the annual hacker convention, it was quite clear that everyone knew Weld, Mudge, Space Rogue and Dildog. L0pht members have become, as Mudge notes wryly, "rock stars of the computer underground." That they help malicious hackers as well as the Feds and big business hasn't hurt their popularity among the outlaws.
On the other hand, L0pht's poorly hidden hunger for the spotlight shouldn't obscure the truly fascinating work they've done. Socially important research is perfectly compatible with, and perhaps inseparable from, love of celebrity, as James Watson has made admirably clear. Say what you will, there is no denying that L0pht's advisories have improved computer security even as they have harmed corporations and government agencies.
No one doubts that information security is going to become an increasingly critical topic as the ordinary economy moves into the digital age. In their grander moments, L0pht's members hope to become digital Ralph Naders, making sure that the software behind the transition is as safe as manufacturers say.
The idea of eight computer hackers in a dingy warehouse insuring the safety of the information age may sound a little farfetched. But sometimes hackers eventually direct their curiosity toward laudable ends. Take, for example, the two young hackers who engineered a small blue box in the early 1970's that allowed free long-distance calls when placed near a telephone receiver. The two enterprising techies went door to door in the Berkeley dorms, selling the devices. Their names? Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, future founders of Apple Computer.

HEADLINE: Sue Thy Neighbor

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon; Tracie Rozhon is a reporter for the House & Home section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
As you and your spouse pull into your crushed granite driveway after a hard day's work at the commodities firm, you both smile, secure in the knowledge that your new multimillion-dollar country seat on half an acre will always grow in value. But wait -- no, it can't be -- what are those brand-new virulently purple flamingos doing on your neighbor's previously pristine lawn?
You fume. In your mind, your house has suddenly become, well, almost worthless. You pick up the phone. Are you going to call the neighbors and politely ask them to take the flamingos off the lawn? (Or the offensive overflowing Dumpster? Or the new ugly fence?) Hardly. You're calling your lawyer. 
 It's time to sue.
Of course, neighbors have been battling one another for centuries over issues large and small. But in recent years, there appear to be a growing number of seemingly frivolous legal battles. While there are no statistics on the subject, lawyers who specialize in real estate litigation say there are more such lawsuits than ever before.
"It's something that's become prevalent," says Kenneth M. Block, a partner in a Manhattan law firm who specializes in real estate and litigation. "As society becomes more litigious, when property owners feel aggrieved, their first reaction is to speak to a lawyer."
Block recalls an incident in which he represented a pianist whose co-op neighbors tried to have her evicted for practicing too loudly. On Long Island, a homeowner who lived next to a polo field sued to have the polo matches stopped.
In Greenwich, Conn., three neighbors recently sued a fourth: Martin R. Frankel, the financier and former fugitive suspected of stealing millions from insurance companies. The neighbors had filed several charges against Frankel, among them that their own houses had dropped in value because of his suspected criminal behavior, as well as the attendant publicity, police presence and Frankel's own extended absence. Before the suit was withdrawn for reasons their lawyer, Philip Russell, declined to discuss, one appraiser backed up the plaintiffs, saying their houses had lost about 20 percent of their value by proximity to Frankel.
Russell compares the situation to that of the O. J. Simpson house in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. "They couldn't sell it," he says. After it was finally sold, the house's next owner knocked it down. "It was a fairly new house, and, suddenly, it was worthless," Russell says.
Others counter that notoriety has no effect. "I live in Darien, and as far as I could see, there was no impact of Alex Kelly's living there," says Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan real estate appraisal firm, referring to the young Connecticut man convicted in 1997 of rape. "I think it might have more of an impact in a down market, where buyers are looking for things to pick on so they can get a lower price."
The experts may never stop arguing about the actual impact of something unpleasant or distasteful -- or something perceived to be so. The more intriguing issue is the change in the neighbors' attitudes.
"In the past, whenever there was a minor issue over a boundary or something like that, the owners would just work it out," says Frank Newbold, a vice president of Sotheby's International Realty and head of its office in East Hampton, N.Y. "Now they just call their lawyer; they'll go to the wall over one-tenth of an inch."
In Southampton, N.Y., a group of residents complained to the local design board about a neighbor who had built a house of corrugated stainless steel. They claimed that the shiny metal was reflecting the sun's rays, and had turned their expensive landscapes into dry toast. While opponents of the house still gripe that the board mistook the steel for clapboards, their claim was ultimately judged to have no merit.
The town's review board didn't do much to appease the neighbors of Ira Rennert, the zillionaire industrialist who is building a 58,000-square-foot mansion in the fields of Sagaponack, near Southampton. The neighbors have (surprise!) filed a legal brief to prevent a renewal of the building permit for what may be the largest single-family home erected since San Simeon.
Earlier this year, in North Haven, N.Y., Thomas D. Mottola, the chairman of Sony Music Entertainment, applied to the village for a permit to build a 200-foot dock -- presumably to accommodate a gargantuan yacht. The neighbors, led by Carol Phillips, a former chairman of Clinique, fought back. The application was approved, but with so many conditions that Mottola took his yacht elsewhere. He sold his place for (sob) $8.7 million.
And no story of Neighbor vs. Neighbor would be complete without the famous contretemps between Martha Stewart, the perky entrepreneur, and Harry Macklowe, the less perky developer. Stewart had cleared some underbrush blocking the view on her property, then applied for a permit. The zoning board decided she had cleared properly, and gave her a permit retroactively. Macklowe, her neighbor, then sued. He lost. In the meantime, the developer erected a large fence. Then the village of East Hampton sued him -- and won. Macklowe was ordered to take part of the fence down. (And yes, there was the much-reported incident in which Stewart was said to have pinned one of Macklowe's groundskeepers with her Chevy Suburban, but the truth of that tale is not clear.)
Although lawyers, including David Vladeck of Public Citizen Litigation Group, say these kinds of lawsuits, or threatened lawsuits, seem to be on the upswing, they make it clear that this phenomenon does not stretch across the economic rainbow. "I think it's only at the high end where you see things that matter so much, things that would be considered absurd by normal people," says Russell, the Greenwich lawyer who represented the neighbors in the suit against Martin R. Frankel.
Stephen M. Raphael, a Manhattan real estate lawyer and developer, also believes the urge to sue is limited to those with ample resources. "Most middle-class and even upper-middle-class people don't bother with this," he says.
But despite the fact that litigation is expensive, you're seeing people buying property today that, because of their stock market gains, they wouldn't have dreamed of owning five years ago. "So on the one hand, they're trying to be blase and cool -- just casually mentioning at a cocktail party that they just laid down $5 million for a weekend house," Raphael says. "But on another level, they're panicked -- and they want to be sure the value is there, and that, after they paid the biggest price on their street to tear down the house and build a McMansion or whatever, they got everything they paid every last exorbitant penny for."
Even if they have to go to court to get it.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In /Brookfield, Conn.;
Rural, With 2 Large Lakes as Bookends

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
FROM the early 1700's to the mid-1900's life in Brookfield was rural, predictable and uneventful. Not even the Revolutionary War affected its measured pace.
In the 1920's, during Prohibition, there was some excitement when bootleggers operating in a few houses along the Still River found a sluiceway and used it as a hiding place for bottles during raids. But the community never grew and just after World War II, with barely 3,000 people in town, the New Haven Railroad closed the Brookfield station for lack of passengers. 
 Train service was never restored, but rural Brookfield nevertheless drew people fleeing the cities after the war and its population more than quadrupled from 3,405 in 1960 to just over 15,000 today.
Home buyers are drawn to the small-town atmosphere, the highly regarded schools, plentiful recreation and a wide range of housing priced from under $200,000 to more than $2 million. On the hills where sheep and cattle once grazed there are clusters of new colonials with superb views, priced from the $400,000's to the $700,000's. A few of the 54 homes in the historic district are available, along with many older homes scattered through town. They are priced from $175,000 up.
Commercially, Brookfield has substituted corporate parks for ironworks and grist mills. Nineteenth-century hatmakers, scissors factories, and carriage-makers are gone, but goods and services are in bountiful supply along the so-called Miracle Mile on Federal Road, where Costco, Seaman's furniture, Office Max, ShopRite, Home Depot, Stew Leonard's and numerous other emporiums are situated.
Developers have been building 4,000- to 5,000-square-foot houses on speculation, said John F. Hegarty Jr., owner of Hegarty & Company Real Estate. "They are selling well because people no longer fear losing their jobs as they did in the early 90's," he said. "There are eight large-home subdivisions of six to 12 homes under construction."
Betty Hensal, owner of Davis & Hoyt Better Homes & Gardens Real Estate, said that her agency had been "getting multiple bids higher than the list price until interest rates went up and it slowed down a bit." But town residents are still moving up to large new homes. Many of them are employed in nearby towns, at Duracell, Boehringer-Engelheim, Union Carbide, Cendant, and I.B.M.
Waterfront properties on Candlewood Lake and Lake Lillinonah comprise some of the highest-priced and lowest-priced real estate in town. Prized for their private beaches, playgounds, ballfields, and boat slips, homes in lakeside enclaves like Candlewood Shores, Barkwood Falls and the Lake Club can run from $150,000 for a 1940's former summer cottage on a minuscule lot to $2 million for a mansion on six acres, according to Stephen Schappert, owner of Buyer's Trust Real Estate, a buyer's broker agency. The Lake Club has a private nine-hole golf course.
Out of a total of 5,532 dwellings in town, 105 single-family homes and 23 condominium apartments and town-house units are currently for sale. While an estimated 1,300 acres of vacant land are zoned for housing, construction is limited by wetlands, rock ledges, two-acre zoning, the absence of sewers and town water and near-perpendicular grades that make driving downhill on some roads a breathtaking experience.
LAST January Sharon and Rick Lees and their two small sons moved to Brookfield from Eden Prairie, Minn., after having lived in New Jersey, New England and Paris. Mr. Lees is an executive with the Dannon Company, in Tarrytown, N.Y.
"We wanted a small, uncrowded town," said Mrs. Lees, "open space with lots of sports and things to do. Candlewood Lake is wonderful and the Danbury Fair Mall is close without being in my backyard."
In their eight-home development, called Muirwood, six customized four-bedroom homes have been sold, on one-acre lots. Built by the Charter Group, a local developer, they cost around $500,000.
Before committing to the house, Mr. Lees visited the schools and talked to the principals. "He was pleased with what he found," said his wife.
"The community expects us to prepare their children to be very competitive for college admissions," said James Chittum, superintendent of the town's 3,000-student school system. In the high school, he added, "we have increased the number of advanced placement courses, honors courses and foreign languages to include French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Latin."
S.A.T. scores last spring were between 30 and 45 points higher than state and national averages. Of the 170 seniors who graduated last June, 81 percent went on to higher education, almost all to four year colleges.
Pre-kindergarten and before- and after-school programs are run at Center and Huckleberry Hill Elementary Schools, both of which were recently enlarged. An 18-room addition to Whisconier Middle School, serving grades 5 through 8, will replace and supplement 11 temporary classrooms when they open in the fall of 2000. Renovation of the high school is next, said Mr. Chittum, "to accommodate an additional 200 students within the next five years."
The only private schools in town are a Montessori Community School for children from 2 to 9 years old, charging from $3,500 to $5,750 a year. Annual tuition at the k-8 Roman Catholic St. Joseph's Parochial School is $2,400 for parishioners, $2,900 for others.
One of Brookfield's 19 nursery schools and day-care centers is run by the Brookfield Regional Y.M.C.A. Before- and after-school care costs $55 to $125 a week and day-care costs $72 to $205 a week, depending on age and hours.
The annual family fee for the Y's 7,000 members is $510. It includes use of the gym, running track, racquet ball, and two indoor pools -- one of which is therapeutic at a constant 92 degrees. There are dozens of exercise, sports, dance, and educational programs at minimal extra charge, and three outdoor pools are attached to the children's summer camp, which costs $150 a week.
BROOKFIELD has no municipal golf course, but the Sunset Hills course, designed by Gene Sarazen, who lived in town and died this year at the age of 91, welcomes all players. Annual membership is $1,000 including greens fees; daily play costs $18 weekdays and $24 on weekends. The par-35, nine-hole course becomes a par 70, 18-hole course by following colored flags that identify a different route the second time around. The course is open from St. Patrick's Day to Dec. 1.
Fifty percent of Brookfield's population use the town's recreational facilities -- "the highest ratio of fun-lovers in the state," says Dennis DiPinto, director of the Brookfield Parks and Recreation Department. That includes 10 public parks, 18 ballfields and 670 acres of land for passive recreation. Resident tennis passes at Williams Park cost $25; hikers can picnic on 100 acres of the Gurski Park, and a third soccer and football field and bandstand are under construction at the Municipal Center.
Brookfield Town Park on Candlewood Lake charges $55 a season for a residents-only boat launch, and $45 per family or $30 per individual for a residents-only beach pass.
On Friday nights up to 500 people bring picnics and listen or dance to free jazz concerts. Across the street, Cadigan Town Park has two tennis courts, badminton, basketball, and volleyball courts, shuffleboard, and a food concession.
Two private boat clubs on Candlewood Lake require members to be boat owners. Annual fees, including boat slips, are $1,870 at Candlewood Lake East Marina Club and $1,500 to $1,800 at Brookfield Bay Marina & Yacht Club. Candlewood East has a snack bar, playground, swimming area, and 200 slips. Brookfield Bay has 170 slips, no food service, but a kitchen and picnic tables for members' use.
Overlooking the lake and accommodating 400 diners, indoors and outdoors, is one of the town's 21 restaurants, called Down the Hatch. Seafood, steaks, chicken, wine and beer are served daily from St. Patrick's Day to Halloween. Dinner for two is about $50.
Founded in the mid-50's, the Brookfield Craft Center, with a nationally known school and exhibition venue housed in several former mill buildings, and the Brookfield Players, where five shows a year are produced in a former private school's fieldhouse, are major cultural institutions.
Brookfield's handsome public library is connected to the Internet and to 45 public and college libraries with which it exchanges information. It has 10,700 card-holders, 58,000 books and 138 magazine and 11 newspaper subscriptions. The town has two radio stations, WINE-AM and WRKI-FM, and the weekly Brookfield Journal supplies area news.
Looking to the future, plans have been drawn for the creation of a Village District at the intersection of Routes 7 and 25.
According to Al Garzi, the volunteer economic development director, a new Village District Zone covering a 200-acre area of nondescript stores and businesses will be redeveloped in colonial style with clapboard and shingle buildings, gas street lights, landscaping, and park benches. Some buildings will be renovated, others demolished.
The result, in five to 10 years, will be a true village green.

No. 1 Destination in 2020? Try China, Then France

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
IT may not be too soon to start brushing up on Chinese. Why? Because by 2020, China is expected to become the world's top tourist destination with 130 million annual visitors, and 100 million Chinese are expected to visit other lands.
By comparison, China had a relatively modest 24 million visitors last year, good enough for sixth place, while the 8.4 million Chinese visitors to other lands ("outbound tourists") ranked ninth. But its 100 million outbound tourists will account for almost a quarter of the 405 million Asian travelers expected by 2020, a staggering increase from the region's 84.4 million outbound travelers in 1995. 
 These forecasts are from the Madrid-based World Tourism Organization, a worldwide group of 138 countries and territories that gathers tourism statistics and publishes reports. At the International Tourism Asia trade show in Hong Kong last month, the organization also predicted that by 2020 France will drop from first to second place in arrivals (even though its visitors will increase to 106.1 million by 2020, up from 70 million last year) and the United States will remain third (102.4 million visitors, up from 47.1 million currently). Spain, with 47.7 million visitors last year, will have 73.9 million in 2020, yet still drop a notch to fourth place. Hong Kong, currently 18th with almost 9.7 million visitors, will vault to fifth place with 56.6 million.
The remaining top 10 positions are expected to be occupied by Britain (currently in fifth place), Italy (currently fourth), Mexico (seventh), the Russian Federation (13th) and the Czech Republic (12th).
The tourist organization also predicted that the ubiquitous Germans, who have long led in outbound travelers, including 82.9 million last year, will continue to lead the list with almost 153 million in 2020. Japanese travelers, who numbered 16.8 million in 1997, the latest figure available, will soar to 141 million, for second place, while the 123.3 million outbound Americans in 2020 will be more than twice the 52.7 million who traveled in 1997.
Predictions, of course, are informed guesses at best, but World Tourism Organization forecasts have often been on target or close to it. Two years ago, for example, it forecast that China will be the world's number one destination by the year 2020, and it stuck to that prediction despite the recent economic crisis in East Asia and the Pacific, which draws many of its tourists from the region. At the Hong Kong meeting, the organization said that to prepare for the expected influx, the Chinese Government is investing a lot of money in promoting tourism and relaxing laws governing the tourist industry.
The tourism organization also predicted almost a year ago that tourism to East Asia and the Pacific would bounce back stronger than ever after 2000, barring any new major incident. And at the Hong Kong conference, Deborah Luhrman, a World Tourism spokeswoman, told delegates that the economy of the region seems to be stabilizing. Despite the economic battering, East Asia and the Pacific still drew a respectable 87 million tourists last year, according to Francesco Frangialli, the organization's secretary-general. Much of the shortfall in Japanese tourists, he said, was offset by Europeans and North Americans attracted by lower prices and good package deals.
Signs of a comeback are already apparent in several Asian nations. Tourist arrivals to Hong Kong, for example, increased 11.1 percent for the first seven months of this year, compared with the same months of 1998. Thailand posted an 11 percent increase through June of this year over the first six months of 1998. And Singapore tourism rose 9.5 percent through July, compared with the same seven months of 1998, even though visitors from Japan fell almost 13 percent.
Nevertheless, it is important to remember that many predictions about tourism are as fleeting as the lifespan of the mosquito. Two years ago, for example, the World Tourism Organization predicted that "the tourists of the 21st century will be traveling further afield on their holidays, with the percentage of long-haul travel increasing from 18 percent in 1995 to 24 percent by 2020." But 13 months later, in November 1998, the W.T.O.'s Business Council (a group representing the private sector within the larger organization) released a study saying that because the amount of leisure time available for many people is likely to decline, the trend to shorter, more frequent holidays closer to home will accelerate -- a trend that has been pronounced in the United States for almost a decade.
Add to that the periodic warnings -- the first more than a year ago from the World Congress on Snow and World Tourism, the most recent a report for the Worldwide Fund for Nature in Britain -- that global warming could erode beaches, reduce snowfall over ski areas and otherwise play havoc with tourist areas, and the future is probably as uncertain as ever. But barring widespread economic, political or climatic upheaval, one thing seems certain -- tourism will continue growing at record rates.
"Our results for 1998 confirm that people do not stop traveling altogether, even during tough times," Mr. Frangialli said. Instead, they underscore that tourism "has become a deeply rooted part of our culture at the end of the 20th century."

HEADLINE: A Glacial Cocktail Party

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN; SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, a former Times correspondent, lives in Kansas.

 BODY:
TO sense the delight of a cruise on the Skorpios III along the southern coast of Chile, imagine this scene the day we returned to the ship for lunch after a morning spent gazing in awed silence at the sapphire beauty of a mile-wide glacier. As some of us competed to find the right superlatives to describe the experience, the Colombian priest on my right raised his wine glass and toasted the captain, Constantino Kochifas, at the other end of the table with the words: "Captain, you have brought us to the gates of Heaven."
Cutting through the waters surrounding the natural ice sculptures in front of San Rafael Glacier at almost 47 degrees south latitude was the high point of the seven-day cruise, but every day in the fjords, lakes and gulfs seemed made for postcards, right up to the 10 P.M. sunsets we watched through the dining room windows as we ate. The trip was half adventure and half lazy pleasure, a few parts funky and a few parts luxury. 
 I had traveled and lived in Chile, and had long dreamed of taking a trip on one of the vessels of the family-run Skorpios line. It was a special thrill to fly out of the Midwest on a January afternoon with snow in the forecast and land 12 1/2 hours later in Santiago, the capital, at the height of summer.
From Santiago, I flew almost 600 miles farther south to Puerto Montt, the main port in the Chilean lake region, to board the Skorpios III, a bright orange and white vessel with three sun decks. Dinner was nearly over that Friday night when I arrived from the airport, and a waiter put me at a table alone, but Mimi de Kochifas, the captain's wife, walked over and set the easy, gracious tone that was to mark the cruise. She said that because I spoke Spanish she would to put me at her husband's table starting at breakfast the next morning.
I was pleased with the comfort of my twin-bed cabin. At 195 square feet, it felt roomy, and the porthole was a real window, a good three feet wide. I was on the Acropolis Deck, the second of five levels. Fine paneling, made from the beautiful woods for which the south of Chile is known, went halfway up the walls. The bath was small, sleek and modern, with a walk-in shower and an adequate vanity. There was an ample closet, a mini-safe, two chairs and a small table, television and internal telephone.
The Skorpios III is the newest of the line's three passenger vessels. Built in 1995, the 1,210-ton ship is 230 feet long and can carry 125 passengers and a crew of 34. Its sister ship, Skorpios II, built in 1988 with similar dimensions and room for 35 more passengers, made the same cruise on the same schedule, usually dropping anchor at ports just before or after we did.
The next morning, after a late breakfast, we sailed south out of Puerto Montt, lounging on the sun decks and waving goodbye to the snow-topped volcano in the distance. The waiters brought us festive aperitifs, including pisco sours, a popular Chilean cocktail, made of a strong grape-based liquour, lemon juice, powdered sugar and egg white. Our voyage was taking us to the San Rafael Glacier and back, a distance of about 400 nautical miles each way. We would be sailing through interior coastal waters, among the hundreds of islands, islets and peninsulas that make up the far south of Chile.
Chile's weather, terrain and flora have much in common with the West Coast of the United States and Canada -- but with the seasons in reverse. It is a skinny country that stretches for nearly 3,000 miles along the west side of South America. The desert is in the far north, the central region has a temperate climate, and the south is similar to the Pacific Northwest -- a green and often rainy area with vast forests and good fishing.
We spent all of the first day sailing, passing through the Llanquihue Archipelago, the Gulf of Ancud and the Gulf of Corcovado. The scenery was a blend of tranquil farm scenes, an occasional fishing village and, in the distance, the lower Andes, dwindling down to a mere 7,000 to 8,000 feet.
At lunch, as the waiters generously poured fine Chilean wines, we all introduced ourselves and learned that we came from 14 countries. Argentines and Brazilians were the most numerous, followed by Chileans. Others came from elsewhere in Latin America. A few came from Europe and Japan, a family of three from Australia; I was the only passenger from the United States. Several children were aboard, ranging in age from 7 or 8 to the early teens. An English-speaking interpreter helped those who didn't speak Spanish.
Captain Kochifas told us his family's story. His father immigrated to Chile from Greece and eventually settled in Puerto Montt and set up a tailoring business. The sons, growing up surrounded by water and fishing boats, learned to sail. Starting from scratch, the captain first built and ran a series of small cargo ships, then some 20 years ago built his first passenger vessel and began to bring passengers to the island-studded seas and secret fjords. His older brother, Demostenes, was the second pilot on our ship. A son was the pilot of the Skorpios II. Other Kochifases were working behind the scenes.
The captain promised us a cocktail called a 12 and 30 once we reached the glacier. The ingredients: 12-year-old Scotch over 30,000-year-old ice -- the estimated age of the glacier. All of the ice we consumed on the ship came from the huge chunks that continually broke from the glacier and slipped into the surrounding lagoon. The glacier and lagoon are in a national park whose unique biosphere is recognized by Unesco; the ice is formed from snow falling on a peak seldom visited by humans.
We quickly settled into a pleasant routine of four meals a day -- breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner, plus morning and evening aperitifs with nuts and chips in the Apollo and Zeus bars. The menus ranged from haute cuisine to sturdy Chilean peasant fare, and it was all very good. Salmon, which is farmed along the coast in the area, was a staple along with other local fish including sea bass, and there were heaping platters of shellfish hauled aboard mid-voyage from small fishing boats. One night, the Chilean college student on my left put away almost six dozen oysters on the half shell. We also had steak and chicken, and the kitchen staff accommodated special requests made a few hours ahead.
The weather was ideal. It felt much warmer under the midsummer sun and cloudless skies than the projected 54 to 72 degrees.
On our third day out, however, I awoke and looked out the window to something awesomely different. The glacier was rising out of the surrounding gray mist as a steady rain beat down on the ship and the waters of the lagoon. The mass of ice glistened white and crystal blue. Two small ice cutters had been lowered from the ship and were waiting to carry us closer to the glacier. The rain was going to make our excursion rather cold and uncomfortable, but it lent drama to the day.
I put on layer upon layer of clothing; as we stepped onto the ice cutters, the crew handed out life jackets.
Approaching the glacier, we first noticed floating around us the huge chunks of ice, pieces that had broken off as if an artist had been wielding a chisel, creating free-form sculptures in strikingly varied shades of blue, gray, green and stark white.
San Rafael Glacier, the centerpiece of a national park of the same name, is part of an ice field created by ice and snow tumbling down Mount San Valentin, which towers 13,300 feet above the lagoon. The captain told us that the glacier was first seen by Europeans some 400 years ago and that, at the rate it wascrumbling, would be gone in 200 years. The ice field extends well inland from the lagoon into an area virtually inaccessible except by foot across rugged terrain. On maps of the region, the ice appears to cover about 60 miles north-south and roughly half that east-west. What we saw was a section an estimated 7,300 feet wide that forms an icy path between mountain peaks, rising 230 feet above the water and down more than 750 feet into the lagoon.
As promised, while we circled before the glacier, crew members jumped up onto one of the chunks of ice and chipped off enough to fill several ice buckets, then brought out fine glassware and poured everybody a hefty amount of Scotch over those crystal-clear rocks. They opened a hamper filled with small sandwiches and followed with hot coffee. With the food and drink gone -- along with most of our film -- we began to feel the chill and were more than ready to return to the comfort of the Skorpios III.
In the afternoon, as a whisper of sun began to peek through the clouds, Demostenes Kochifas guided the ship closer to the wall of ice, and some of us crowded around him on the bridge to watch as, every few minutes, a piece would split from the front of the glacier and cascade into the lagoon. Those of us with cameras tried capturing the moment when the ice splashed into the water.
At 5 P.M., we turned our backs on the glacier and sailed back toward sunny skies and warmer weather.
We reached Quitralco Fjord, jutting deep into another national park, this one covered with forests and fields of wildflowers. We dropped anchor beside a dining hall and thermal baths that the cruise line operates on the edge of the wilderness, and some passengers went ashore for a quick dip in the 90-degree waters.
The next morning, we raced in small boats through the fingers of water branching off from the main fjord, then returned for what Latin Americans call a parrillada -- a mixed-grill feast. We began with the tasty meat pies, empanadas, followed by steak, sausages, potatoes, salad and the usual good wines. On the wall behind our table were models of the nearly dozen boats and ships the captain had built. There were also old family photos and a big one of the captain and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel Laureate in literature, together at the wheel.
From Quitralco, our ship continued lazily north, through countryside that had the look of Switzerland -- black and white cattle grazed in neat pastures on rolling hillsides, framed by vast stands of trees. We were back to basking in the sun in our bathing suits. On the west lay the large island Chiloe, some 125 miles long and one of the places identified with Darwin's voyage to the area on the Beagle in the 1830's.
Our last stop before returning to port was Castro, Chiloe's principal town and a significant fishing and artisan center. It also marked our return to the money economy. The night I boarded, I simply stashed my money in the mini-safe, and then enjoyed the unusual sensation of not having to spend any for the next five days. But now, it took cash to satisfy my urge to buy the hand-knit woolen cloche hat I found in the handicrafts market for $4. And then $30 more to buy a hand-woven woolen jacket.
But the true souvenir of the trip was that first sight of the glacier -- fixed in my mind, as a glimpse of what Heaven should be.
 
Booking a trip on Skorpios III
 
Getting There
 I flew American Airlines nonstop from Dallas to Santiago, then bought a round-trip ticket on Ladeco, a Chilean airline, to Puerto Montt, about 600 miles to the south. There is a flight every few hours on Ladeco or LAN Chile. By waiting until I got to Santiago to buy the ticket, I paid $250, while the price to buy it in advance in the United States was $376.
 
Contacting the Line
 The Skorpios III and her sister vessels, Skorpios I and II, sail between Puerto Montt and the San Rafael Glacier in the far south of Chile from September through May -- which covers the Southern Hemisphere's spring, summer and fall. For the 1999-2000 season, the weekly cruises began Sept. 4 and continue through the week of May 27.
Prices vary according to the month and the ship. High season runs from mid-December through mid-March, which is the Chilean summer. Everything else is low season.
On the Skorpios III, the newest of the three vessels, built in 1995, high season prices for a double cabin range from $3,400 to $5,000 a cabin, with suites at $5,300 and $5,800 a cabin. Low season prices range from $2,600 to $3,700 double and $3,850 and $4,100 for suites.
The Skorpios II, built in 1988, has prices ranging from $2,800 to $4,200 for double cabins in high season and from $2,100 to $3,220 in low season. She also has three- and four-person cabins with bunk beds, plus suites. The Skorpios I, built in 1978 and with bunk beds in many of the cabins, has doubles ranging from $2,100 to $3,240 a cabin in high season and $1,600 to $2,400 low season. It also has three-person cabins and some junior suites.
The prices cover everything on board -- four meals a day, cocktails and wine -- and the mixed grill at the cruise line's dining hall near Quitralco Fjord. I needed money during the cruise for taxis at a couple of fishing villages where we stopped, handicraft purchases and tips for the crew.
Pleasant as the cruise is, making arrangements for it from outside of Chile requires some tenacity. The cruise line has a Web site at www.skorpios.cl, where I found useful information on the schedule and itinerary, but when I used the E-mail address to ask about availability of particular dates, I got no response, even after a couple of proddings. Eventually, I called the cruise line's agency in Santiago, (56-2) 231-1030, fax (56-2) 232-2269, and quickly got answers and made a reservation. Telephone numbers for the Skorpios headquarters in Puerto Montt are (56-65) 255050, fax (56-65) 258315.
I was asked to pay by direct transfer to a bank in Miami, for which the agency in Santiago faxed me the necessary forms. But an Australian traveler on my voyage said he was able to pay by credit card at his hometown travel agency. SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
A Photographer on the Blurred, Chaotic Edge

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
DAIDO MORIYAMA'S vision resides in the heart of darkness, literally and figuratively. The world he records is black, stunned rather than illuminated by light, threatening, chaotic, incomprehensible, compulsively erotic, obsessed, eccentric, fixated on consumption, devastated by accidents, always off kilter, sometimes ruined, sometimes empty -- a world unaware of its own instability, a world in need of Prozac.
His photographic technique, all blur and scratches, bleach and dust, joins with his subject matter to conjure documents on the verge of disintegration. At times Mr. Moriyama tinkers with the limits of perception, which he makes look hopelessly narrow, and with the limits of photography, which he makes seem very limited indeed. This is a tough vision, even a fierce one, individual, authentic and pursued to the far reaches of its own premises, and it can be seen all over New York right now.
 Born in 1938, Mr. Moriyama is one of Japan's most respected and influential contemporary photographers, but little known in America, though his work has appeared in group shows here, even in New York. 
 The first retrospective exhibition of Mr. Moriyama's photographs anywhere in the world (the Japanese not caring much for retrospectives of living photographers) is divided between "Daido Moriyama: Stray Dog" at the Japan Society Gallery on East 47th Street, which includes 130 photographs from several of his major series, and "Daido Moriyama: Hunter," 40 photographs from a 1972 series, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (both through Jan. 2). These joint shows were organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (where it had its premiere last May) and the Japan Society Gallery. Sandra S. Phillips, the curator of photography at the San Francisco Modern, is the curator; an informative catalogue accompanies the exhibition.
In addition, the Laurence Miller Gallery, on 57th Street, has 32 prints by Moriyama, some not in either of the other exhibitions, and the Roth Horowitz Gallery, on East 70th Street, has an exhibition of photographs by Shomei Tomatsu, a major photographer whose work had a significant impact on Mr. Moriyama's. Roth Horowitz is also showing pictures from Provoke, a short-lived, extremely daring Japanese photography magazine of the late 1960's, as well as books by Provoke's contributors, including five by Mr. Moriyama, who almost always worked with books in mind.
A late 1960's series of nudes by Mr. Moriyama, evidently sex workers, with an occasional male leg or two in the picture, are at once flatly explicit and softly romantic, the bodies thrown so far out of focus that little besides the dark circles of the nipples and the dark patch of pubic hair confirm the subject matter. In 1972, when he and others had already tossed over the tradition of polished photographic techniques, Mr. Moriyama pushed the medium into illegible territories, as if to say that photography could not record what really mattered. In a book called Farewell Photography, not only are the photographs out of focus, scratched up and marred by dirt and light flares, but some of the subjects are also indecipherable, and some are apparently about nothing, emptiness, the void. Later he had a change of heart; after giving up photography for a couple of years, he returned to it in 1982 with colder but also clearer images, what might be called a more perfectly focused nihilism.
The eponymous stray dog appears in one picture as a shaggy beast, menacing, wary, a street wanderer looming enormous in the frame. At the Japan Society, an installation of 3,400 Polaroid images Mr. Moriyama took of his living and working space in 1997 (the only color in any of the shows) centers on this image. The photographer recently told Photo Metro magazine that when he photographs, he walks down the main thoroughfare, diving into and out of alleys, like a stray dog.
He is indeed an urban wanderer, an outsider, feral in his ways, often shooting from the hip, sometimes on the run, or from the shadows, through fences, from the windows of a moving car -- an image thief, snapping away on impulse and intuition in response to the crazy rhythms of the modern life. He also likes to make images of images, particularly movie posters advertising sex and violence. It is not always clear whether a photograph is of a picture or of the thing itself; by the 1960's the two were already nearly interchangeable.
Sometimes people pose for his camera, like a suburban couple clutching a box of detergent. More often he steals the picture. What he catches in his nearly random net is the peripheral vision of a city dweller, the bleary bits and fragments, the chance events and partly registered perceptions of our rapid daily rounds. "Chaotic everyday existence," he once said, "is what I think Japan is all about." When he has gathered sufficient chaos, he edits it into a detonating order all his own: pulsing, nonnarrative, ambiguous and textless pairs and sequences in magazines and books.
Attracted to outsiders and outlaws, Mr. Moriyama has photographed more than once where he is not welcome. A young woman in one picture races away frantically down a trash-filled alley. At a recent lecture, Mr. Moriyama said she was running because she had got in trouble with the yakuza (Japanese gangsters), and that he was beaten up and forced to rip his film out of his camera after he took the picture. As this was not his first such encounter, Mr. Moriyama had devised a way to keep his film intact while pulling a fresh roll out of the camera. The scent of something ominous that filters into his photographs begins to feel like a whiff of realism.
"I will go and take photographs," he told an interviewer, "as long as I still am capable of running away when someone tries to punch me. I can tumble." Mr. Moriyama is not the first who could make you think that a slight touch of craziness might be a valuable trait for those who want to be photographers; at any rate, he is obviously devoted to his profession and his subject.
THE catalogue, with essays by Ms. Phillips and Alexandra Munroe, Director of the Japan Society Gallery, fills in some background information on the Zeitgeist that put this work in motion and the context that surrounded it. There was, of course, the inescapable fact of two atom bombs dropped on Japan. Mr. Tomatsu, only eight years older than Mr. Moriyama, documented the direct effects of the bomb on survivors, but generations are so brief today (and Japan underwent such rapid and overwhelming changes) that someone eight years younger saw another society, shaped first by catastrophe but then reshaped by subsequent events. Americans were a major presence in Japan and American popular culture a major import. Mr. Moriyama was fascinated by the driving energy, the sex, modernization and liberal Western customs that were infiltrating Japan and forming new hybrids with the traditional culture.
Many Japanese were furiously resentful of the invading, occupying power, Mr. Moriyama apparently less so. Demonstrations against the treaty that allowed American military forces in Japan turned particularly violent in 1960. Strikes and student protests soon became more violent too, the Vietnam war making a profound contribution to the depth of the dissent. As in other places, the 1960's were a time of public turmoil, experiment and drugs, complicated in Japan by nuclear destruction, the miraculous economic rebirth of the country, and the bewildering atmosphere of transition between an old society and a new and foreign one.
Photographers, including Mr. Moriyama, needed a new way to respond to this wave of ferment and change that was engulfing their country. At Roth Horowitz, the display of Provoke magazine and books makes clear that he was not reacting alone but was part of a photographic movement that sprang up in Japan, with obvious affinities to movements in Japanese literature and film, in reaction to what amounted to an existential crisis as the frenetic modern world transformed the country.
Other countries had been experiencing related changes and upheavals. Globalization was already on its way, and artistic ideas traveled between continents on the backs of publications. Mr. Moriyama was shocked and influenced by William Klein's book of photographs of New York, published in Japan in 1957, with its raw vitality and confrontation, grotesqueries of the street and fierce disregard for technique. He took what he could use and moved on.
Later a friend showed him a Warhol catalogue that shocked him again with its emphasis on death and consumerism. Mr. Moriyama did a series of photographs of accidents, some of them details of a police safety poster. He also took pictures of canned goods on grocery store shelves, even Campbell soup cans. Where Warhol's repeated soup cans are clean, mechanically repetitive displays of forced cheerfulness -- the alluring calculus of a consumer culture -- Mr. Moriyama's are morose masses of identical labels rushing toward a numbing infinity of manufactured goods. By the 1970's, the economic boom had submerged the idealism of the 1960's in Japan as it had elsewhere, leaving frustration and discouragement in its wake.
An understanding of Japan's upheaval is probably crucial to an understanding of this work, and the influences count, too. But in the end, the artist is an individual with a mind and feelings and talent that nothing external can wholly account for. Different photographers using the same photographic language in the same places wrote different synopses of their times. Art continues to move in mysterious ways. Let us now give thanks for mysteries.

A $35 Million Luxury Rental Rises in Florham Park

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
LATE in the 1980's, a wooded 40-acre site along Columbia Turnpike in Florham Park was slated to become an office development. That project never moved forward and now the property has a new owner and a different future as a luxury rental community.
Avalon Bay Communities, a real estate investment trust based in Alexandria, Va., that builds only rental apartments, began work in June to turn the site, and two small nearby parcels totaling 1.5 acres, into 270 one- to three-bedroom town-house-style apartments with garages. There will also be an outdoor pool, a one-acre central green and a 3,500-square-foot clubhouse on the site at the northern edge of this Morris County borough. 
 Called Avalon at Florham Park, the project, estimated to cost $35 million to $40 million, will rise over the next 15 months. It is the sixth project in New Jersey for Avalon Bay, which since 1988 has built 2,268 rental apartments in the state. It also plans to start two more developments with a total of 704 units next year.
The Florham Park project is evidence that the state's rental market, like its other housing sectors, has benefited from the strong economy. Last year there were 5,097 housing permits issued for rentals, up from 3,346 in 1997 and from 3,122 in 1996, according to state figures. Still, the 1998 number represents only a fraction of the total of 35,721 permits issued that year.
Much of the new rental housing is going up in towers along the Hudson River waterfront. The activity thins out in the suburbs, but developers like Avalon Bay are moving in because they say the suburban rental market is not being adequately served.
"The demand is there because there haven't been a lot of rentals built in a long time in the suburbs," said Jan L. Decker, a principal at Integra Krauser & Cirz, a real estate advisory and services firm in Morristown. Ms. Decker, who specializes in multifamily housing, puts the rental vacancy rate in the state at 5 percent.
THERE are challenges to developing in the suburbs, she and other real estate professionals said. Among them are the lack of properly zoned land and community resistance to rentals, which many towns perceive as adding to their school-age population.
But many developers use the state's Mount Laurel doctrines as a way to maneuver their way into communities, Ms. Decker said. Those policies require each of the state's 566 municipalities to provide the opportunity for housing to be built for families who earn 50 to 80 percent of the median income in the area where the housing is being constructed.
Some of the new rental projects contain both market-rate apartments and units designed for tenants covered by the Mount Laurel policies. The market-rate apartments have high rents with increases just keeping pace with inflation, said Ms. Decker. Demand for rentals will continue to be steady least through next year, she added.
Avalon Bay's Florham Park project marks its entry into Morris County. Sandra F. Bertelsen, senior development director at the company's New Jersey operation in Princeton, said her company had targeted the county because "it has a tremendous number of corporate office users" and a large number of "high-end single-family-home choices" with few rental apartments.
Two other rental projects are under way in the borough, each with some low- and moderate-income units to help Florham Park just about complete its Mount Laurel obligation. Those projects, next to one another on Passaic Avenue in the borough's eastern sector, are Sun Valley at Florham Park with 305 units, 75 of them Mount Laurel rentals, and Riverbend, with 200 units, including 50 Mount Laurel units.
The two developments, along with a third completed project with 150 rentals, all of them low- and moderate-income apartments, are the result of a Mount Laurel court settlement, completing the town's obligation for 280 affordable units, said Dwight F. Longley, Florham Park's business administrator.
For Avalon Bay's project, Ms. Bertelsen said negotiations began two years ago with the borough to rezone the three commercially-zoned sites to residential use.
Mr. Longley said all the issues, from the project's impact on traffic to its effect on the borough's schools "were dealt with at length, and the decision was that the project fulfilled a perceived need for upscale dwellings." It is also expected to have "a nominal affect," on schools, he said. To help deal with the traffic impact, Mr. Longley said, the developer is putting the project's main entrance on Fernwood Road, a side street, rather than on the commercial Columbia Turnpike, and is installing a traffic light at the intersection of the two streets.
The town-house-style units at the project, designed by Lesserd Architectural Group of Vienna, Va., will be in 45 two- and three-story buildings that will be laid out in five city-like blocks on half the site, with the one-acre green at the center. The other 20 acres contain wetlands, which under state law cannot be developed and will remain open.
Each building will have four to eight 16-foot-wide units around an interior courtyard. The traditional-style buildings will have varying rooflines and each unit will have different brick and vinyl facades and separate entrances "so they look like row houses," Ms. Bertelsen said. The project "is intended to be consistent with the colonial image of the downtown," she added.
Monthly rents for 800 to 1,800 square feet are to be $1,400 to $2,500, Ms. Bertelsen said. Leasing is to begin in January.
WORK also is proceeding at the other rental projects, where construction has been delayed until recently because the developers needed to install sewer lines as well as build a sewage treatment station to accommodate their projects. That work is now under way.
"Because so few rentals are being built there is no competition but among ourselves," said Eric J. Harvitt, project manager at the 60-acre, 305-unit Sun Valley at Florham Park community. The project is being developed by a group of New Jersey developers under the corporate entity of Sun Valley at Florham Park, of Woodbridge.
There will be 230 two- and three-bedroom market-rate units, with garages. The larger duplex units, with 1,380 to 1,540 square feet are above the one-story smaller units, which will have 1,100 square feet plus a lower level recreation room, Mr. Harvitt said. The Mount Laurel units will be smaller. Planned amenities include a playground and tennis courts, he said, adding that two-thirds of the site will remain undeveloped because of wetlands.
Though rents have not yet been set Mr. Harvitt said they are not expected to be as high as those at Avalon Bay's project. Leasing will begin next summer when the initial units are completed, he said.
At the 30-acre Riverbend project the 200 units will sit on half the site along with a clubhouse and outdoor swimming pool. The other half will be left open because of wetland constraints, said Wayne Zuckerman, a principal of Sterling Properties of Livingston, which is developing the complex at an estimated cost of $25 million
"Because the demand is so strong," Mr. Zuckerman said, "the three projects will provide choices for renters, from young professional couples to empty-nesters."
The one- to three-bedroom apartments, including duplex units, have 950 to 1,250 square feet, and all have garages. The affordable units will be smaller. With completion over a year away rents have not been set, but will be competitive, said Mr. Zuckerman.
Sterling is also working on two other suburban rental projects. One, in Springfield, in Union County, has 75 apartments, including some low- and moderate-income units; the other, in Neptune in Monmouth County, has 81 market-rate units. "We build wherever we can find the land, which is a scarce commodity," Mr. Zuckerman said.

HEADLINE: Nassau's Odd Election Season: Republicans Bicker, Dems Unite

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
WITH the election just a month away, this year's political season in Nassau County seems to be breaking all the political molds.
To start with, the leading spender is someone who's not even running. County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta isn't up for re-election until 2000, but his habit of running up giant budget deficits has become the overriding issue, and he is broadcasting $200,000 worth of television ads defending himself and his budget proposal for next year. 
 The Democrats campaigning for the County Legislature -- where all 19 seats are on the November ballot -- are trying to turn the election into a referendum on Mr. Gulotta. But the big twist is that Mr. Gulotta's fellow Republicans are publicly divorcing him, with a commercial in which the Legislature's presiding officer, Bruce A. Blakeman, promotes his own plan to solve the budget crisis.
Even Mr. Gulotta's old running mate, Comptroller Frederick Parola, has said that the county is "sinking in red ink" and denounced the latest budget proposal as "smoke and mirrors" and "another disingenuous financial document."
"I've never seen anything like it," said Desmond Ryan, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a group of developers.
Those are not the only peculiarities in this year's campaign. For a change, the Democrats are not feuding among themselves. After years of fractious leadership fights, they appear united under their new chairman, Thomas P. DiNapoli. Although he is not running, he stars in Democratic ads as the spokesman for his party's slate.
The Democrats can barely contain their glee over the Republican split. "They're acting like us," Mr. DiNapoli said. "We're acting like them."
Most intriguing, anecdotal evidence indicates that a number of loyal Republicans throughout Nassau are fed up and say they are not going to take it anymore. "I have not yet met a Republican who says they're voting Republican in November," said Bruce Nyman, the city manager of Long Beach and former minority leader in the Legislature.
Over the last four months David W. Denenberg of Merrick has been knocking on thousands of doors as the Democratic nominee in the 19th District, including Bellmore, Merrick, Point Lookout and parts of Seaford, Wantagh and Freeport. "A lot of Republicans are saying, 'I'm a lifelong Republican, but I'm not voting Republican this year,' " he said. "The number who say, 'Do something about the budget,' is just unbelievable. The economy has never been this good, and for the county to be running a deficit is purely ridiculous mismanagement. If somebody can pull off an upset, this will be the year."
The 19th is one of several battlegrounds where the long-languishing Democrats say they have a chance to expand their delegation in the Legislature, where they hold only 5 of the 19 seats. But the ultimate question is whether there are enough disenchanted Republicans for the Democrats to overcome the odds and wrest control of the Legislature for the first time.
"It's the biggest issue that my party has faced in many years," said the Nassau G.O.P. chairman, Joseph N. Mondello, But he said that the Republican county legislators reject Mr. Gulotta's budget proposal and will adopt their own "even if it means taking on the county administration -- and that's what it's going to mean."
"It tends to confuse people and did nothing except hurt the Republican ads," Mr. Mondello said. "I called Tom Gulotta and asked him to stop the ad. He did not give me a yes or no."
The Republicans cannot be discounted. Sporadic Republican scandals and feuds have inspired Democratic hopes over the decades, but usually they have been dashed on election day. The Republicans still have lopsided enrollment margins in most districts, and political experts say that Nassau still has the nation's premier local Republican organization, with an unparalleled skill in fund-raising, flooding mailboxes and getting voters to the polls.
What do political polls show? The Democrats say they cannot afford them, and the Republicans are not releasing theirs. But the scuttlebutt is that Mr. Gulotta's usually high favorable ratings have plummeted and that the budget crisis is a drag on the Republican slate.
Even now, Democratic optimists seem a bit hesitant to dream. "We'd love to do it in 1999," Mr. DiNapoli said of his party's prospects for taking control, then cautiously added, "but we'd settle for 2001."
To do that, the Democrats would have to double their current 5-seat delegation to 10. At the bare minimum, they want to add two more seats this year. That would give them a taste of real power, since they could block the two-thirds vote needed to approve bond issues.
Topping the Democrats' list of targets is the 1st District, which was supposed to be a Democratic seat. But in both 1995 and 1997, the Democrats had divisive primaries, and in the general election that followed, a dissident Democrat ran on a splinter party line and split the vote. That handed victory to the Republican, Darlene D. Harris, a lawyer from Uniondale. This time, however, the Democrats are united -- no primary and no dissident candidate -- behind Patrick C. Williams Sr., a mortgage company executive from Uniondale.
The next Democratic target is the 5th District, including Rockville Centre, Baldwin, Oceanside, Freeport and South Hemsptead. The Republicans have a hefty 48.5 percent of the voters, with 27.2 percent for the Democrats. But a rare case of Republican infighting in 1995 enabled a Democrat to snare the seat. Reunified Republicans won it back in 1997. This time the Democrats are trying to recapture it by running a renegade Republican, Joseph K. Scannell, a former assistant district attorney from Baldwin, against the freshman incumbent, Thomas A. Glynn, a funeral director from Rockville Centre.
Democratic strategists cite three other races where, with a bit of luck, the tables could turn:
* The 18th District, including most of northern Oyster Bay Town, where the two-term incumbent Republican, John Canning, a lawyer from Sea Cliff, faces a spirited challenge from Dr. Brian T. Muellers of Glen Cove, the research and development director of the Pall Corporation. The Democrats hope to get a lift from the re-election bid of Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi and his slate in Glen Cove.
* The 7th District, the Five Towns area plus Island Park and Bay Park, Mr. Blakeman's seat. He is a rising star and a possible successor to Mr. Gulotta. But in a statewide race against Comptroller H. Carl McCall last year, Mr. Blakeman barely carried his district. His challenger this year is Jeffrey W. Toback, a lawyer from Oceanside who scored 46 percent last year for Town Board in Hempstead, the highest vote ever for a Democrat in that Republican bastion.
* The 19th District, where Mr. Denenberg, a lawyer specializing in patents and the environment, is making his bid. The Republican incumbent, Edward H. Ward of Seaford, agrees that this year is different. "When I go door to door, people say, 'What are you going to do about Gulotta -- get rid of him,' so he's hurting us," he said. "But my opponent's only program is trying to connect me to Gulotta. That's their M.O. I'm being attacked for everything Gulotta has done from birth."
Mr. Ward stresses his record on neighborhood issues and promises that the deficit will be plugged. But with the budget adoption process on a dual track with the campaign -- the deadline for passage is three days before the election -- that issue will remain at center stage.
The budget presents both opportunity and danger. If the Republican legislators come up with a plausible solution, they bolster their campaigns. To the extent they change Mr. Gulotta's proposal, they distance themselves from him. But the deficits are so big -- $192 million last year, a gap estimated at up to $140 million this year and suspected gaps in the proposal for next year -- that the remedies could entail unpopular tax increases and program cuts.
"It's going to take more than cosmetic surgery," Mr. Blakeman said. John V. N. Klein, a Republican and the former Suffolk County Executive, said: "They're going to have to administer medicine, and a big dose. The upside is it demonstrates the leadership people are looking for."
Voter backlash could result, however, and the election-eve timing may be attacked as belated and suspect. "The stupid thing from a political point of view is to adopt the budget right before the election," said Dr. Stanley B. Klein, a political science professor at C. W. Post College and an active Republican in Suffolk. "The legislators can become the bad guys."
Democrats are trying to pin the deficits on both Mr. Gulotta and the Republican legislators. "They can say from now to doomsday they're separating themselves from the County Executive," said Judith A. Jacobs, the minority leader in the Legislature, "but they're the ones who rubber-stamped his programs, who voted for his 1 percent real estate transfer tax."
The Republican retort is that they have trimmed $100 million from Mr. Gulotta's last three budgets, and though that was not enough, they will do more. "We've been the ones at the forefront of change," said Mr. Blakeman. "It's just going to take more change than before." He challenged the Democrats: "They have never proposed their own alternative budget. What's your plan?"
Democrats have called for a fiscal oversight board, which the Republicans resisted in favor of an advisory panel, and have also proposed more competitive bidding and cuts in patronage jobs, in cars for officials and in fees paid to outside lawyers. The Republican plan includes cutting outside lawyers and consultants and the salaries of top officials, and pay freezes for nonunion workers.
Mr. Gulotta's plan includes higher property taxes, a new telephone tax, reduced staffing and unpaid furloughs.
The budget crisis seems to have struck a nerve because Nassau is among the wealthiest counties in the nation, and these are booming times. From Washington to Albany to New York City, governments are piling up surpluses and cutting taxes. Next door, Suffolk County is balancing its books, cutting property and sales taxes and hiring more police. "People are frustrated that our county is in the red when everyone around them is in the black," Ms. Jacobs said.
"It's a pocketbook issue," Professor Klein said. "For the first time since the Legislature was created, there is a countywide issue of very high visibility that really affects property owners. The Democrats have a chance to unseat some Republican legislators. If I were Mondello, I would be running around screaming."
Mr. Gulotta, re-elected two years ago in a landslide, suddenly finds himself isolated. His policies are attacked by the Democratic State Comptroller and Republican County Comptroller, and the bond market has dropped the county's credit rating to barely above junk bond status. In recent weeks he has lost yet another budget director, his county attorney and his press secretary.
Yet Mr. Gulotta sounds unflappable as ever. Defending his television ad, he called it "very similar" to Mr. Blakeman's. "The ads, if you listen to the text, really complement each other," he said. "It demonstrates that the Republicans are working together and have a solution that will eliminate the deficit."
But Mr. Blakeman issued a warning. "We would prefer that the County Executive not interject into this election, since he is not running," he said. "We will continue to demonstrate our independence as a separate branch of government. The Legislature doesn't run the day-to-day operations and wasn't designed to. But we may have to break the traditional barriers, because the county has not lived within the budget we have given them in the past."
Professor Klein said of the Republican feud, "They have moved about as far apart from him as they can and still be under the same banner."
Improved chances of winning have attracted stronger candidates, the Democrats say. "This is probably the best crop we've run for the Legislature," said Mr. DiNapoli. Among them is Matthew A. Cuomo, a lawyer from East Williston, a nephew of the former Governor, Mario M. Cuomo.
Campaign funds are is crucial, and the Republicans are said to be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Democrats cannot match that, but Mr. DiNapoli is getting donations for the television ads and hopes to have a rally with Hillary Clinton. Candidates are also foraging on their own. Mr. Denenberg, for example, has raised $30,000 so far.
Turnout, most experts agree, will be a key to the outcome. Unhappy Republicans may simple stay home, so Democrats say they have to get their own forces out. "Nassau Democrats are infamous for not voting in off-year local elections, and this is as off a year as you can get," said Mr. Nyman.
Republican leaders, who usually compete to see who can get out the biggest vote, must switch to a completely different strategy this time. "I don't envy Joe Mondello this year," said Mr. Nyman. "This isn't going to be an traditional vote-pulling operation. Before, it was easy. You looked in the voter book and whoever had an R next to their name, you called them. Now you have as many angry R's as D's."
One Republican committeeman, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that the party is trying to identify still-loyal Republicans. "It's almost like a stealth campaign," he said.
Forecasts of the outcome vary wildly. "This may be the best chance the Democrats have had since Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater," said Mr. Nyman, although he concedes it would be hard for them to take control. Mr. Gulotta said: "I believe that the Republican candidates are going to do extremely well, much better than some might anticipate, and there's a good chance they might capture one or more Democratic districts."
One confidant of the leaders at Republican headquarters in Westbury, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: "There are a lot of sleepless nights in Westbury. The Republicans are beside themselves. It is a party at war with itself. There's a quantifiable fear that Tom Gulotta could singlehandedly cripple their pluralities."
Professor Klein predicted that the Republican margins will shrink and they will likely lose some ground but not control. "At best the Democrats pick up a few seats," he said. "They will be delirious, and the Republican will feel destroyed."

For Port Chester, a $120-Million Riverfront Project

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER

 BODY:
AN ambitious $120-million redevelopment project was given final approval last week by this two-and-a-half-square-mile village, known for its distinctive globe lighting downtown and its multi-ethnic variety of restaurants.
The 27-acre project is designed to attract new tenants to its downtown riverfront. In the process, it will displace some existing businesses. 
 The village gave its final approval last Wednesday and one of the developer's principals said he was negotiating with existing tenants, either working them into the project or helping them find another downtown location. If necessary, the village could also take over property by eminent domain.
"We're trying to start a rebirth of Port Chester," said Gregg Wasser, a principal with G & S Investors, of Old Bethpage, N.Y., the designated developer for the project. "We want to bring in stores that will generate interest, and attract business from the surrounding area, things like a multiplex movie theater, a supermarket, clothing retailers and fun, entertainment-type activities."
As now envisioned, the 483,000-square-foot development will include some new construction, as well as the rehabilitation of existing businesses in an area bounded by South Main Street and the Byram River and Westchester and Purdy Avenues.
In addition to entertainment and retail components, the project will include a riverfront park, marina and promenade, as well as surface and garage parking for 1,850 cars, Mr. Wasser added, noting that G & S Investors was using its own equity and bank loans to finance the complex.
"We're trying very hard to work with everyone," Mr. Wasser said. "We want to be as fair and generous as possible with everyone. In the end, we want everyone to be happy."
The only new tenant to sign on so far is Costco, a leading chain of discount-club warehouse stores, which will occupy a two-story 140,000-square-foot store at Westchester Avenue and Traverse Street. "It will occupy one and a half acres and replace some old industrial buildings on the site now," Mr. Wasser said.
He said that it would be only the second two-level store in the Costco chain.
"Since it's a downtown location, we thought it was important that it fit in with the prevailing architecture and not be a sprawling concrete structure typical of that kind of retailer," said Mr. Wasser, who built a Costco in New Rochelle.
Mr. Wasser said that he hoped to have the first building in the overall project started by March or April. "The first phase should take about nine to 15 months, then the next phase about six months," he added. "We expect the whole project to take two to three years to complete."
For years, Port Chester has been approached by movie operators who wanted to build a multiplex theater in the village, said Mayor Christine Korff. "But we always envisioned a movie theater as part of a whole development complex," she said. "We wanted to build something that would fit in with our whole downtown."
She now sees Costco, a multiplex theater and a supermarket as the anchors of a project that will include "stores selling books, linens, apparel."
"And we'd like to also have two restaurants," she added, "one near the theater for the after-movie crowd, and maybe an open-air seafood place near the marina."
Similar waterfront projects are also under discussion for Yonkers, Tarrytown, Peekskill and New Rochelle, all with the same intention of attracting business and people to the waterfront, and replacing industrial buildings with new development.
THE Village of Port Chester has a rich industrial past. It was originally known as Sawpits because of the prevalence of sawmills in the area. In the 1830's residents changed the name to Port Chester after Chester, England, the birthplace of many of its early settlers.
For years, the village was home to a number of industries, the last of which was a Life Savers plant that closed in 1984 and had since been converted into condominiums.
Today, the downtown's image is somewhat mixed. North Main Street was refurbished in 1987 when the street was widened and lined with 80 saplings. Overhead wiring and utility poles were replaced with 49 Victorian-era lamps, each with four globes, resulting in one of the most distinctive night-time streetscapes in the county.
While North Main Street still has its share of vacant storefronts, it has also attracted most of the village's more than 100 restaurants, where cuisines include South African, Brazilian, Ecuadorean and Peruvian.
South Main Street, in contrast is "underutilized," the Mayor said. It has been more hampered by vacancies and outmoded businesses. "It has a laundromat and some small stores," the Mayor said, "but also a lot of vacant lots and buildings."
The redevelopment plan will attempt to save buildings in the designated area that have architectural interest, said Mr. Wasser. "We want whatever is built there to fit in with what's there that's worth preserving," he added.
There have been several other development plans for the area, the most ambitious proposed more than a decade ago by the Robert Martin Company. Approved in 1986, the $250-million project included a 315,000-square-foot shopping center, 660 apartments, a 20-screen movie theater and a waterfront park and promenade.
"That one fell through for a variety of reasons, mostly to do with the timing," Mayor Korff said. "It was to be built at the time when the real estate market fell off."
The current project is different, the Mayor said, in that it doesn't include housing. "We didn't want a residential component," she said. "We don't want our schools taxed any more."
Like many other school districts in the county, Port Chester's has experienced increasing enrollment, which has resulted in overcrowding at some grade levels. "We've already had to add classrooms to our four elementary schools," Mayor Korff said. "We want this project to help with our tax base, not add more expense."
Not everyone in the village is happy about the redevelopment plans, including some merchants who have yet to work out a deal with G & S Investors. Tav Passarelli, owner and operator of Westchester Marina Services and Ebb Tide Rentals, both on the Byram River, is one of the dissidents.
"I don't want to lose my business," Mr. Passarelli said. "If they come in here and want to move me, where am I going to go? There's no other place on the water available, and that's where I need to be. I don't see how they can help me."
Mr. Wasser said that he was determined to work out compromises with Mr. Passarelli and any other retailer. "We want this to work out for the village in the long term," he said. "And that's only going to happen if everybody's happy."

HEADLINE: Easing the Rules for Mortgage Approval

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
THE sisters Arlene Jones and Judith George are close. They grew up together in the Virgin Islands, and after they arrived in Brooklyn in 1978, when they were in their early 20's, they lived in apartments two blocks apart.
They long hoped to own homes near each other, and this year they achieved that goal. They moved into side-by-side two-family houses on Elton Street in the East New York section of Brooklyn, each paying $175,000 for a house newly built through the New York City Housing Partnership program. 
 "We were lucky to find it," said Ms. Jones, who is an executive assistant at Keyspan Energy, the parent company of Brooklyn Union Gas. When they were house-hunting the builder still had adjoining houses available in a development of 40 houses that were in construction.
They were lucky for a less obvious reason as well. In considering them for a mortgage, Chase Manhattan Bank let them count most of their prospective rental income in a way that qualified them for the loan they needed. They would not have qualified for their loans if the bank had used traditional underwriting standards.
The less restrictive standards have come into wider use in recent years in the sales of homes that have at least one rental apartment. They have had the effect of allowing creditworthy borrowers with somewhat lower incomes -- usually close to the median family income in New York City of $50,000 a year -- to buy houses. Ms. Jones and Ms. George have incomes in the $40,000-a-year range.
The basic change is that in determining the borrower's ability to afford the loan, a large portion of the rent that will be collected is applied as an offset to the monthly costs the borrower will bear. Buyers for years have thought that they were doing just that by getting a rental tenant or two. But the principle had not been generally embraced by mortgage lenders in loan underwriting. Instead, a portion of rental income was merely added to the buyer's gross income to determine eligibility. This creates a higher ratio of housing costs to income than the new method does.
For the buyer who can afford a 5 percent down payment, the new method makes it more likely he will qualify for a loan of 95 percent of the purchase price of a two-family house.
"A significant number of two- to four-family home buyers have benefited from this approach," said Wesley A. Wainwright, senior vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank in charge of residential lending in the Community Development Group.
Since 1986, the major banks supporting the New York City Housing Partnership's program of new-home construction for moderate-income buyers have used this approach in qualifying purchasers. But it got greater impetus in 1994 when Fannie Mae, the nation's largest purchaser of mortgages from banks and other home-mortgage originators, introduced pilot programs to stimulate the home sales market in New York and Boston. Fannie Mae packages these loans with other mortgages as securities for sale to investors. Creating a market to which mortgage originators can sell their loans encourages them to lend more.
Under the Fannie Mae pilot program, the houses may be either newly built or previously occupied. The purchasers do not have to be first-time buyers, although most have been. The buyers must live in the house they buy, and if they formerly owned a home, they have to have sold it before they close on the new one. There are no income restrictions on buyers.
In a typical situation, a creditworthy buyer with an income of about $45,000 in wages and the ability to make a 5 percent down payment would qualify for a 95 percent mortgage on a two-family house costing about $200,000, Fannie Mae said. This assumes that the apartment would rent for about $800 a month. Previously the same buyer would probably have needed $55,000 a year in income to qualify for the loan.
Since the pilot program began, it has been used in about 10 percent of all the loans for two-family to four-family houses in New York City that Fannie Mae has purchased, the company said. Last year, Fannie Mae's total purchases of New York City two- to four-family loans was 4,200 -- with an aggregate value of $788 million -- and 11 percent used the pilot underwriting.
"It seems to be having its greatest effect in Brooklyn and Queens, and especially for two-family homes," said Naomi Bayer, director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, which was established in Manhattan four years ago. She also said that most buyers may not need such financing, because they have higher incomes or can make a higher down payment. They also may not know about it, she said, so they may not ask their lender about it.
The monthly payment that a home buyer makes to a lender covers not only the principal and interest due on the mortgage loan but also contributions to escrow accounts for real-estate taxes and insurance, and, in many cases, private mortgage insurance on that portion of the debt that exceeds 80 percent of the value of the house. Bankers refer to the monthly payment they receive for these obligations as the "PITI" payment, an acronym for principal, interest, taxes and insurance.
Under the pilot program, the bank, in calculating how large a loan it will offer to the purchaser of a two-family house, uses 75 percent of the buyer's anticipated rental income as an offset to this monthly payment. The minimum down payment is 5 percent, and the buyer must have at least $1,000 a month in additional income after the monthly payment is made.
The standards are slightly different for three- and four-family houses, but the principle is the same. These buyers must put down at least 10 percent, and the income they have left after their monthly payment must be higher -- at least $1,250 for a three-family loan and $1,350 for a four-family.
IN standard underwriting of residential mortgages, rental income is considered too. But it is added to the buyer's gross income rather than deducted from monthly costs for purposes of calculating how large a loan the borrower can afford. The standard approach leads to a more conservative loan.
The pilot program has been been used by buyers spending over $300,000 for a two-family house, bankers say. The national 1999 limits on loans that Fannie Mae will buy -- $240,000 for a one-family house, $307,100 for a two-family, $371,200 for a three-family and $461,350 for a four-family -- apply to the pilot program as well.
Fannie Mae requires that first-time buyers get counseling both in home ownership and in acting as a landlord before it will buy these loans. In resale housing only landlord counseling is required.
Patrick J. McEnerney, president of the Bank of New York Mortgage Company, said that it is only in the last year or year and a half that the new Fannie Mae standards have become widely available in three-family and four-family sales, although in two-family sales they have generally been used.
"It always take a little time for the lending community to get comfortable with new standards," Mr. McEnerney said, "and we're only beginning to get enough data on the performance of these loans to the threes and fours."
One older house was purchased recently by Dimitriy Bobkov, 23, an information specialist with I.B.M., who arrived in the United States from Ukraine five years ago, and his brother Vitaliy, 31, who is a self-employed computer technician. Their combined income is about $80,000 a year, Dimitriy Bobkov said.
The brothers bought a three-family house for $194,000 in the Sea Gate section of Brooklyn a year ago with a Bank of New York mortgage, and also spent about $25,000 to improve it, doing much of the work themselves. They are getting $500 a month in rent from a tenant, a friend who agreed to rent the apartment before the brothers bought the house. They received a $174,600 mortgage at conventional rates.
"Possibly we could have gotten another loan but it would have been much more trouble," Dimitriy Bobkov said. "We would have had to put 20 percent down instead of 10 percent." And the rent calculation would have been less favorable.
More liberal underwriting also carries risks, for both the lender and the borrower. Nowadays many lenders are offering subprime loans, for example, which go to less creditworthy borrowers and carry higher-than-normal interest rates. Presumably, during a period of prosperity and high employment borrowers in general will be successful in carrying this debt burden.
But many lenders and housing specialists caution buyers about becoming too dependent on rent. What happens in a recession, and a weakened housing market, when both buyers and renters may face a loss of income? If the tenant cannot afford the rent, will he leave quickly and be replaced by another tenant at the same rent? If the owner has to seek an eviction in housing court, will he get quick action or have to go for months with no rent collections?
"The Fannie Mae program is a fabulous thing if it's used correctly and not abused," said Keith Kantrowitz, president of Power Express, a mortgage company in Great Neck, N.Y. He said that about 20 percent of the resales of two- to four-family houses that Power Express finances in the city use the Fannie Mae pilot program.
"If the program were not there, many buyers would be forced to use subprime loans to buy their house, if they could buy at all," he said.
But some buyers overlook potential problems that mortgage underwriting does not take into account, he said, and then they lack the resources to deal with them. There can be overoptimism on the rents that can be obtained and unanticipated problems with basic housing systems. Heating costs and water and sewer charges may turn out to be beyond expectations, and the cost of gardening and cable service may have been overlooked.
Mr. Kantrowitz said he had already seen evidence of negative effects. Over the last five years, there have been seven foreclosures in loans Power Express financed, more than would be expected in an upward market, he said, because buyers facing foreclosure might be expected to sell and move. In one case, a borrower of $211,000 made 40 payments on time and then abruptly stopped paying for a full year, Mr. Kantrowitz said.
"The tenant simply stopped paying the rent, and the owner can't get him out," he said. "And the house isn't salable. Who would buy a house when the tenant's not paying?"
In another case, a 1996 buyer of a three-family house in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn with two tenants in place made only three payments on a $221,000 loan. "She moved into an area where the cost of child care was much higher than she expected," he said, "and then the cost of heating buried her." It was winter and she was getting heating bills of $600 a month. She had budgeted $150 a month.
"You don't go into a house in December on a budget that uses average year-round heating costs," Mr. Kantrowitz said.
In new housing, some of these problems are minimized. The owner gets to select the tenant -- many times a family member -- and operating costs are more clearly foreseeable. Tax abatements for new home construction, which are passed on to buyers, also are a big help. "For a novice in home ownership, the new house has great advantages," Mr. Kantrowitz said.
ANOTHER advantage for any owner is a healthy rental market. Rising rents may help the home buyer even in the early years of ownership.
In the Highbridge section of the Bronx, Isabel Santos has had a positive experience with tenants. She said she was well aware of the risks she was taking on when she bought a new three-family house on Woodycrest Avenue through the Partnership program for $322,000 five years ago. "I was worried about my ability to find responsible tenants," said Ms. Santos, who is in her 50's and a field worker for a union, earning in the high $40,000-a-year range.
As it turned out out, she has not only had regular rent collections, but also the rents have risen -- from a total of $1,640 for the two apartments to $1,725, which fully covers her monthly housing costs. "I didn't even have to advertise for tenants," Ms. Santos said. "They're both friends of mine, and one is a colleague at work."
In the Housing Partnership program, nonprofit organizations working with lenders provide budgeting and landlord counseling. The Partnership itself, in collaboration with developers, provides instruction on homeowner maintenance, and it expects in the future to take on both aspects of owner education.
There have been 14,000 Partnership home buyers since 1986, and more and more of the newer houses are three-families. Nowadays the loans are normally sold to Fannie Mae, and the underwriting for them follows Fannie Mae's standards.
"We couldn't be developing two-and three-family houses without the Fannie Mae underwriting," said Gale Kaufman, vice president of the Housing Partnership. Rental income is a secure form of income, she said, and the renters are often the owner's relatives. Loans made under the Partnership program have a default rate of less than 1 percent, Ms. Kaufman said.
But as in any home purchase -- whether a new house or a resale -- buyers are responsible for their own decisions. The obvious precaution they are advised to take before they buy the house is to have it inspected. This is often done in a cursory way, however, by buyers eager to save money or lock in the purchase with a contract so as not to lose out to another buyer.
"Nowadays there's pressure being put on buyers to go into contract within 10 days," said Donald J. Siracusa, whose home-inspection business, Absolute Building Inspections Ltd., is based in Bay Terrace, S.I. Buyers are often not willing to take the time or pay the price for a proper inspection by a professional certified by the American Society of Home Inspectors, in Des Plaines, Ill., said Mr. Siracusa.
"There's such a lack of knowledge." he said. "Many buyers don't even read the report when they get one. Or they hire people unqualified to make them, who are too close to the sales broker." The cost of a proper inspection for a two-family house on Staten Island has been about $350, Mr. Siracusa said. The reports that he gives to customers, with photographs, are in narrative form.
Fannie Mae made the following comparison to explain how the pilot program would make a two-family home purchase affordable while conventional underwriting would not.
In Fannie Mae's conventional underwriting for two-family home loans nationally, buyers must make at least a 10 percent down payment (but only 5 percent in New York City, and 3 percent for single-family houses). In addition, 75 percent of the owner's rental income from the rental apartment would added to the buyer's annual income to calculate eligibility.
So if the house costs $200,000 and the buyer earns $44,000 and can collect $850 a month in rent, the buyer's income would be considered $51,644 a year. Three-quarters of the rent -- $637 a month, or $7,644 a year -- would be added to annual income.
Although this buyer might be able to make a 5 percent down payment, his application to borrow $190,000 would probably be denied. A 30-year loan at 7.5 percent interest, plus payments to escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, would bring the applicant's monthly payments to about $1,660, or $19,920 a year. This is 38 percent of the buyer's gross annual income of $51,650. The normal limit in affordable-housing programs is 33 percent.
In the pilot program, no more than a 28 percent ratio of housing costs to income is allowed (but 33 percent for new houses in the Partnership program). The $44,000-a-year buyer would find the $190,000 loan affordable. His monthly obligation would be only $1,023 after deducting 75 percent of the rental income ($1,660 minus $637). On an annual basis, net housing payments would be $12,276 ($19,920 minus $7,644), or 27.9 percent of his income.
AFTER all the calculations are made, the lender would take into account the buyer's residual income after his monthly payments, to assure that the borrower is not overly dependent on rental income.
Arlene Jones, who bought the house in East New York next door to her sister Judith, a Board of Education employee in downtown Brooklyn, said that they had advertised for a renter in the Amsterdam News and received about 60 phone responses.
A representative of the Brooklyn Neighborhood Improvement Association, which assists moderate-income home buyers, interviewed three of these respondents. Only that many were willing to risk $50 for an interview and credit check.
One tenant was selected by Ms. George. Ms. Jones re-advertised and then found one. The rent levels turned out to be higher than those used in the underwriting, by $50 a month in one case and $80 in the other, Ms. Jones said.
The sisters have been in their homes for two months. Ms. Jones, who has four daughters ranging in age from 7 to 22, said her family had lived for 20 years in an apartment that had only one bathroom. Now she has two. She also has her own parking place, on her own property right next to her house.
"I love it," she said.

When SavingsBonds Sputter

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach to and arrival at retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LAST May, Richard P. Drury, 74, a retired civilian employee of the Army who lives in Hilton Head, S.C., was reading a newspaper article that led him to a startling discovery: 15 United States savings bonds held by him and his wife, Carol -- and worth a total of $3,707.90 -- had not been earning any interest for at least three years.
He immediately cashed in these Series E bonds, which he had acquired for $562.50 through a payroll deduction savings plan, and stuck the money in a bank account. 
 Before reading the article, Mr. Drury had no idea that the Government changed its rules about such bonds in 1965. Under that revision, Series E bonds issued through November 1965 earn interest for 40 years; those issued in December 1965 and later earn interest for just 30 years.
"I never knew that," Mr. Drury said. "All the information I had been reading was printed prior to 1965 and it said 40 years. Can you imagine the number of drawers or safety deposit boxes throughout this country that are just salted up with bonds like these?"
Daniel J. Pederson, a former supervisor of the savings bond division of the Federal Reserve and the author of "Savings Bonds: When to Hold, When to Fold and Everything in Between" (Sage Creek Press, fourth edition, $19.95), has calculated that there are more than $6.5 billion in savings bonds that have stopped earning interest and have never been cashed in. Some people tuck away savings bonds and forget about them; others mistakenly think that the bonds will earn interest as long as they hold them.
Savings bonds are popular, especially with older investors. Over all, 55 million people hold a total of $180 billion of savings bonds of all types.
People like the bonds because they are easy to buy and, though the various interest rates may be modest, their safety is rock solid. And because you don't get the interest until you cash in the bonds, taxes can be deferred until then, too.
The popular Series EE bonds, the successors to Series E, can be bought for as little as $25 each with a face value of $50; the most expensive cost $5,000, with a face value of $10,000. Bonds reach "original maturity" when they are worth their face value; they continue to earn interest until they expire, but at differing rates.
As a result, figuring out when to cash in a bond can be tricky, Mr. Pederson points out. It can make sense to redeem a bond early if it is paying a particularly low rate, but the problem is identifying the rate a bond is paying.
Because banks make virtually no money from savings bonds they sell and redeem, they have little incentive to train employees in the details of savings bond management. And because savings bonds are a do-it-yourself investment, Uncle Sam, despite switching the rules from time to time, doesn't send you a statement outlining your holdings.
If you're not sure of the status of a bond, look first at the issue date in the upper right corner. Any bonds issued from 1941 through October 1959 have stopped paying interest, as have bonds issued from December 1965 through October 1969.
Series EE bonds, which were first issued in 1980, earn interest for 30 years from the issue date. The same is true for the new Series I bond, whose return is linked to the Consumer Price Index.
Interest rates depend on when a bond was bought. Newly purchased Series EE bonds earn a market-based rate equal to 90 percent of the average of Treasury issues with five years left to maturity. The rate, currently 4.31 percent, is reset every six months. Inflation-protected Series I bonds now pay 5.05 percent.
"Each bond needs to be looked at as an individual investment," Mr. Pederson said.
It is difficult for most bond holders to even calculate how much interest they have accumulated -- and how much their bonds are therefore worth. Mr. Pederson's company, the Savings Bond Informer in Detroit (800-927-1901), appraises savings bonds for clients based on a sliding scale. For 1 to 10 bonds, for example, the fee is $15; for 700 bonds, it is $119. A report analyzes each bond for a number of factors, including the current rate it is earning, and offers advice on the best time to sell it. The Savings Bond Informer also has a Web site (www.bondhelp.com).
The Government, meanwhile, offers a somewhat similar but less extensive service free on the Web, at www.savingsbonds.gov. It requires downloading and installing a program called the Savings Bond Wizard on your personal computer.
AFTER his discovery, Mr. Drury had some of his older bonds appraised by Mr. Pederson's company. So did Walter H. Smorowski, 79, who lives in Des Plaines, Ill.
Mr. Smorowski, also alerted by a newspaper article, realized that he had about $6,000 of Series E bonds that were no longer paying interest. Before cashing them in, he got a report from the Savings Bond Informer that told him exactly how much they were worth. It was a good thing, he said, because his bank at first wanted to give him $1,000 less. The bank quickly corrected its error.
"If I hadn't gotten that report, I probably would have just taken what they offered me," Mr. Smorowski said.

Chasing the Gum Chewers of Russia

BYLINE: By JOHN VAROLI 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG

 BODY:
ONCE a forbidden pleasure denounced by Soviet officialdom, chewing gum has become entrenched in Russian pop culture.
Consumer demand for gum has led to a $180 million market -- and, over the last two years, has brought investments of more than $170 million by international manufacturers in Russian operations. 
 The William Wrigley Jr. Company of Chicago, the world's largest chewing-gum company with global sales of $1.8 billion last year, has captured about 60 percent of the Russian market, according to A. C. Nielsen, the market research company. But in the battle for shelf space in Russian stores, kiosks and cafes, Wrigley has been dogged by an upstart from Denmark, a family-owned company named Dandy, maker of the Stimorol and Dirol brands, with $300 million in worldwide sales. Although its figure does not jibe with the Nielsen number for Wrigley, Dandy claims 45 percent of the Russian market.
While younger consumers can hardly remember life without gum, those in their late 20's and older have a different story to tell.
"When I was a little girl, my swimming coach would tell us that foreigners put needles in chewing gum to hurt Russian children," recalled Anastasia Vasilevskaya, 28, now deputy director of a British-owned real estate company in St. Petersburg. "This was their way to keep us from chewing gum," she said, adding, "I often chew it now."
Viktor Voronkov, a sociologist in St. Petersburg, said, "Thanks to the efforts of Soviet propaganda, there existed a stereotype of the uncultured American chomping on gum in the most disgusting manner."
"Why chewing gum?" he added. "Well, it was just an accidental symbol of the American way of life, which was labeled antagonistic to the Soviet life style."
With Russia embracing a market economy, many young people are buying gum, even though the average monthly salary is only 1,000 rubles, or about $40.
"Confectionery is one of the first to rebound after any crisis since prices are relatively low and affordable to the general population," said Philip Wegh, director of the new Dandy factory.
Kim Iskyam, a consumer goods analyst at Renaissance Capital, a Moscow-based investment bank, said Wrigley and Dandy "are interested in Russia because it is a large market that is still in its infancy, being relatively unsaturated." Renaissance Capital is part of Sputnik Holdings, owned by the Russian-American financier Boris Jordan.
Since the Russian financial crisis of August 1998, the ruble has fallen from around 6 to the dollar to a little over 25, sharply raising the cost of most domestic goods as well as imports. Wrigley and Dandy, because of their intense rivalry, have not raised prices as much as most manufacturers, though a packet of chewing gum has climbed to 6 or 7 rubles, from 3 before the crisis.
Evidence of the battle can be seen on television, where Russians are bombarded by advertising for Dandy's Dirol and Wrigley's Doublemint, Juicy Fruit and Orbit, a brand popular in Europe though virtually unknown in the United States.
In Wrigley's testimonial ads, young Russians praise Wrigley's "amazingly long-lasting flavor."
In addition, both companies are emphasizing what they call "dental positioning."
"Dirol is functional chewing gum, and in our ads we try to communicate the benefits of chewing it in the fight against tooth decay," said Stanislav Cherkasov, Dandy's media and public relations manager.
An even stronger indication of the foreign companies' commitment to the Russian market is the money spent building plants here. The $70 million Wrigley plant in St. Petersburg began production in late winter and will produce 15,000 tons of gum annually, not only for Russia, which Wrigley says is one of its top 10 markets, but also for export to Europe. Such exports would be important in case of persistent economic difficulties in Russia.
Dandy built a $95 million plant in Veliky Novgorod, 112 miles southwest of St. Petersburg, where it will make 7,000 tons of Stimorol and Dirol a year. Lars Funder, general director of Dandy, said it was "100 percent committed to the Russian market."
Wrigley executives were also upbeat. "Our sales last year in Russia were around $100 million," said Stefan Pfander, Wrigley vice president for Europe. "Despite the economic difficulties" last year, he added, "we are here for the long haul."

Where One Hand Polishes the Other

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
WHEN Charles Flickinger, owner of Flickinger Glassworks in Red Hook, Brooklyn, received an order last month for glass bowls with engraving at the bottom to enclose hanging lights, he knew what to do. "I told them, 'If you want engraving, then you need Tomas Tisch,' " he said.
Mr. Tisch, whose glassworking studio a few blocks away has a view of the Statue of Liberty, said that when people come to him with restoration projects, he sometimes shares the jobs with Pier Glass, another company down the street. 
 And if someone walks into Pier Glass's studio with a broken Tiffany-style lampshade, Mary Ellen Buxton, who owns the shop with her husband, Kevin Kutch, will often refer the customer to Mr. Flickinger.
Among the glassworkers of Red Hook, one hand polishes the other. There are at least a dozen businesses and more than 20 artists in the neighborhood, and they do windows as well as lamps, home accessories and sculptures. From a lone stained-glass shop by the Gowanus Canal just outside Red Hook 25 years ago, a community has grown up that reflects various aspects of working glass: blowing it, bending it and sandblasting it.
"Even though we are all in glass, we are all in different areas," said Daniel Preston, whose research and development company, Preston Glass Industries, designs machines that punch out mass-produced items like lightbulbs, and also creates custom bulbs for NASA and McDonnell Douglas. "There is not a lot of overlapping."
Mr. Preston said he had relocated from West 14th Street in Greenwich Village a year ago because rents were becoming outrageous. When he rented his 4,800-square-foot loft there in 1996, he said, he paid $14 a square foot per year; a year later his rent was $18. So he moved to Red Hook, where he bought a three-story 7,000-square-foot loft building. Mr. Preston would not say what he paid, but said that because the building, on Coffey Street, is in a city economic development zone, he received tax incentives.
Natalie Hurwitz, a broker with Sholom & Zuckerbrot Realty, said prices for such properties have been rising. "A large Red Hook warehouse is asking $55 a square foot," said Ms. Hurwitz, who was formerly with the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, where she helped relocated businesses. "Just a few years ago, the asking price would have been in the 30's."
Ms. Hurwitz estimated loft space rents in Red Hook at $4 to $5 a square foot and warehouse space at $5 to $7 a square foot.
"We looked in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, but here we could get more space for the money, and the landlord was willing to work with us," said Mr. Kutch, who had a rugged tan from standing in front of his furnace, which reaches temperatures of 2,400 degrees.
Peter Waldman, who rents a small studio on Conover Street, said glassworkers can be a tough bunch. "When you work with glass, you have to have a certain amount of ego," he said. "It's a difficult and demanding medium, and takes a certain kind of personality. The people tend to be very assertive."
But a sense of camaraderie prevails among many of the neighborhood's glassworkers. In spring and summer, there are impromptu cookouts, and Pier Glass, which set up shop on Beard Street five years ago, holds an annual Fourth of July barbecue.
Glassworking studios need kilns to melt the finely granulated quartz sand, soda ash and pulverized limestone used to make molten glass, which has the texture of honey. They also need places to reheat the glass while they work it, ovens to anneal the finished product and diamond saws and grinders to cut, shape and smooth it. Setting up a bare-bones glass-blowing studio can cost $20,000, Ms. Buxton said, and can easily run $80,000 for something more elaborate. Monthly costs for rent, gas, electricity can be upward of $3,000.
Alison Ruzsa, another Red Hook artisan, said people who work with glass can benefit from being around their own kind. She said neighborhood glassworkers have developed a kind of barter system, giving one another access to equipment or technical knowledge in return for cleanup help or assistance with projects.
Mr. Tisch, who specializes in engraving, said he liked being part of a community. "You can just walk downstairs and stay in touch," he said. For six years he lived away from other artists, glass or otherwise, in the woods of upstate New York. "It was very beautiful," he said. "But even with all the electronic conveniences of E-mail, fax and telephone, you still need to have live contact."
Last year, he moved from a 500-square-foot studio on East 70th Street in Manhattan, where he had been since 1992, to a 1,700-square-foot studio on Van Brunt Street in Red Hook. In Manhattan he paid $1,300 a month. In Red Hook he pays $1,000.
Mr. Waldman, whose small studio next to the Waterfront Museum and Showboat Barge, an exhibit and performance space where he produces shows, said he liked the serenity of the neighborhood. "I'm from the Midwest," he said. "Red Hook is like living in the country in the middle of the city. It's quiet at night. There are lots of artists, musicians, sculptors and painters who like this kind of environment, who are trying to escape the intensity of the city. You have to take a train and a bus to get here."
But that is no deterrent to business, glassworkers say. Artists tend to sell their work through galleries elsewhere and craft shows around the country, and the more industrial glass businesses depend mainly on referrals, not walk-in trade.
Mr. Kutch, who does both commercial decorative work and his own sculptures of solid glass infused with neon, said the isolation enables him to concentrate on the ineffable thrill of working with the medium. "It's magical, mysterious," he said. "Working with glass is like turning lead into gold. I am in love with the unlimited capabilities of it. It's like it's lit from within."

The high rate of unemployment among people with disabilities "Jobs Aplenty, but Disabled Find No Welcome," Sept. 19 is not only a tremendous disservice for these individuals, but also a great loss to American businesses and to our society.
Rather than ignoring the potential of people with disabilities, companies should them as a valuable untapped resource. In this very strong economy where many companies are finding it difficult to to recruit entry-level and support workers, it is clear that people with disabilities can fill this gap. 
 People with developmental disabilities are hard-working and dedicated employees. I encourage more businesses to follow the lead set by these companies.

Another Branch of Art in Brooklyn's Forest

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
THERE is more than one way to look at the Fulton Avenue strip leading to the Billie Holiday Theater in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, a neighborhood that consists mostly of struggling African-Americans and Caribbean immigrants. One can calculate the dollars it would take to overcome the poverty lurking in the doorways of the fast-food stores and the beauty-supply outlets and among the fresh-air vendors with their goods arrayed on rickety tables. Or one can see a place ripe for dreams, where people need inspiration as much as rent money to carry on.
Marjorie A. Moon, the executive director of the Billie Holiday Theater, is in the inspiration camp. Uplifting art, she says, is as essential to working-class and poor people as roofs over their heads and food on their tables. 
 While a very public debate about the uses of art goes in another pocket of the borough, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Billie Holiday Theater quietly delivers a brand of art with a purpose, or values, if one wants to use that dreaded word.
Ms. Moon allows that in some ways it would not be bad to have the kind of attention that the Brooklyn Museum received last week from Mayor Giuliani's campaign to cut its city financing because of an exhibition that he considers anti-Catholic. But the truth is that her constituency is basically conservative. They are people just trying to make it from day to day as they confront inferior schools and streets that could be safer. What they look for in drama, Ms. Moon said, is ways to deal with their problems.
These seem to be quiet, reflective times in many underserved and black communities. Just last weekend, hundreds of people from the St. Paul Community Baptist Church in East New York, Brooklyn, made a pilgrimage to Queens as part of a religious remembrance of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Ms. Moon is tapping into that impulse toward introspection and healing.
"Our plays always have to have some redeeming value to them," said Ms. Moon, a self-described child of the 60's who has been at the theater's helm since 1975. "There's enough malaise, disappointment and heartache out here. There are issues our audiences like seeing and experiencing that they can't see anywhere else. What can be done about child abuse or how to cope with being a single head of household?"
"They don't want profanity, they don't want sexual situations, they don't want compromising situations," she said of her audience. "They want to bring the entire family. They want to be able to bring the pastor. We're not looking for Mary Poppins or something that's not real, but it has to be instructional."
The new season, which begins later this month, consists of just three plays: a mystery/comedy about a detective pursuing the killer of a prominent black lawyer; a drama about a family on the eve of the father's release from a mental hospital, and a comedy about a retired English teacher whose life suddenly includes an 18-year-old school dropout. They are the kind of homespun morality tales that will not attract much critical attention or political outrage.
In many ways, the 200-seat theater, which has an annual budget of $400,000 from the city, the state and private sources, is a relic of a louder and more optimistic time. Founded in 1972 as one of three cultural institutions that were part of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, the nation's first community development corporation, it is also a survivor in its little corner of the world.
The corporations belong to an era when many Americans believed that an infusion of dollars was all that was needed to revitalize communities like Bedford-Stuyvesant. But while the neighborhood has pockets of gentrification, most of its people are still poor and isolated.
New York is the cultural capital of the nation, yet most people in this neighborhood do not see themselves or their experiences in mainstream theater. The glittering shows of Broadway and even Off Broadway seem out of reach, culturally and economically. At the Billie Holiday Theater, tickets are $12.
During its last season, the theater felt more than its usual financial constraints. While the Mayor and the City Council engaged in an especially heated version of the annual wrangling over how the city should finance arts group, the theater's annual budget was held up and its money was parceled out monthly or bimonthly. People from the community stopped by with checks, some for as little as $5 or $10.
The other day, a young mother holding her infant son came in to ask about ticket prices. Another person dropped by to get a program for the new season. Some contractors were using the building for a conference.
These are quiet times.
"One day you wake up and you're over 50 and you've been here for over 25 years," Ms. Moon said. "There were so many things we believed would happen in the 60's and the 70's. Now, when I'm in the theater and the audience is laughing and talking back to the stage and the connection has been made, that's the meaning, that's the thing that gets you beyond day to day."

The Web Hasn't Replaced The Storefront Quite Yet

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
MORE bad news for bricks-and-mortar retailers: A new survey has found that 30 percent of the personal computers bought by American households in the last six months were purchased directly from the manufacturer. That represents a sharp jump -- up more than a half -- from the previous six months, according to the market research firm Odyssey, based on its twice-yearly surveys of the technology buying habits of 2,500 American households.
The trend should further strengthen the position of Dell Computer and Gateway, the leading direct marketers of PC's. It can also be seen as a more general sign of things to come. After all, Internet commerce is merely the direct-sales model on steroids, as Michael Dell says, with customers and suppliers enjoying an electronic connection, any time, any place. 
 "The businesses that should be most concerned are the retailers," said Nicholas Donatiello, president of Odyssey in San Francisco.
In some industries -- computers, travel, banking -- the Internet direct sales threat is severe, to be sure. But the notion that people are about to do any substantial portion of their overall buying on line is suspect, if not downright nonsense.
Oddly, few things drive home that point more clearly than a recent study on the outlook for on-line retailing from Forrester Research, which is regarded as an unequivocal bull on E-commerce. And it is the kind of research that helps put in perspective some of the revolutionary rhetoric about the "new economy."
Forrester's widely quoted projections on the growth of on-line sales have a hockey-stick trajectory, and its report issued two weeks ago is no exception. In fact, the forecasts in its new report have been revised upward: Forrester now expects on-line retail sales in the United States to rise sharply this year, to more than $20 billion.
By 2004, Forrester predicts that retail sales over the Internet should reach $185 billion -- a huge number, representing striking growth. Still, even assuming that this heady forecast proves accurate, the $185 billion will be just 7 percent of total retail sales in the United States, Forrester reports. Guess who accounts for the other 93 percent? "Obviously, the bricks-and-mortar world is not going away," noted David Cooperstein, an analyst for Forrester.
The modest lesson here is that a passing familiarity with economic statistics is a useful tool for anyone trying to make sense of the Internet-driven new economy. Yes, there is a lot of growth, excitement and substance to the Internet economy. There is also a lot of hype and churning and many failed start-ups -- but that is all part of the process of entrepreneurial endeavor. Hype encourages investment, which accelerates the innovation cycle of trial and error, leading to growth-creating breakthroughs.
Yet for all the attention given to Internet companies, they still represent mainly an innovative ferment on the surface of the nation's economy. As Kevin Kelly, editor at large of Wired magazine and author of "New Rules for the New Economy" (Viking Press), has noted, the new economy doesn't replace the old economy; it builds on top of the old, and its technologies eventually permeate the underlying layers.
In America's $8.5 trillion economy, that two-step process will not happen overnight, even if the Internet enthusiasts are correct in saying it is inevitable. Recognizing that reality, Forrester called its recent report "post-Web retailing." Established retailers from Wal-Mart to Tiffany are already building up Internet presences, and more will follow. But as Mr. Cooperstein of Forrester sees it, the future belongs to those who pursue a "multichannel strategy."
Look no further for a pioneer of that future than Gateway. Starting in 1997, Gateway began opening retail stores across the country -- 180 so far, heading for 400 over the next few years. But they are retail stores with a difference, likened to petting zoos for PC's, so people can come in and try out the Gateway machines, which are all connected to the Internet.
These stores have no inventory on shelves in the back room. Customers place orders and receive delivery a few days later at their homes. So all the advantages of scale of Gateway's direct business model -- made-to-order manufacturing, warehousing and delivery -- remain intact.
FURTHER and more futuristic second thoughts on Internet retailing can be found in an intriguing research paper by Hal R. Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. In his paper, Mr. Varian raises questions about economic efficiency and consumer benefits often predicted for Internet shopping -- a world, it is said, in which a person's "software agent" will roam the Net on his behalf, seeking the best bargains.
Perhaps, but perhaps not, Mr. Varian says, if the predicted shakeout occurs in some on-line markets. He looks at two established electronic markets with a limited number of suppliers -- airline computerized reservations systems like Sabre and market makers in Nasdaq stocks -- and suggests that a result can be price-signaling and implicit collusion among those suppliers. At Nasdaq, of course, a price-fixing investigation was prompted.
"Everybody says the Internet will be a consumer paradise," Mr. Varian said. "But it is not so clear that consumers will be the winners in the long run."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Nieuw Haarlem Is Revisited 341 Years After the Conquest

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
Was it a Dutch invasion? Or perhaps a second invasion?
In 1658 the Dutch Governor, Peter Stuyvesant, claimed northern Manhattan as Nieuw Haarlem, naming it after a city near Amsterdam. So when the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Wim Kok, came to Lenox Avenue and 125th Street Tuesday, some suspicions were raised. 
 Mr. Kok said he and his delegation came to learn about Harlem's recent economic revitalization. But Terry C. Lane, the president and chief executive of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, told the Prime Minister that he had invited his own delegation to their meeting, just in case. "Just want to let you know," he said, "Harlem is not for sale." Mr. Kok smiled and said the main purpose of his visit was to exchange views about addressing poverty.
Later, accompanied by Secret Service agents and two dozen Dutch reporters, he admired the brownstones on Lenox Avenue, some renovated, some boarded up. At St. Martin's Episcopal Church, the carillon rang out the Dutch national anthem, or a tune that some Dutch reporters said sounded like the anthem. The bells were installed 50 years ago, a gift of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, who visited the church in 1952.
Mr. Kok also stopped at North General Hospital, the state's only black-owned private hospital. The Prime Minister asked the hospital's president, Harold P. Freeman, about the uninsured, who make up 20 percent of its patients. In the Netherlands, medicine is socialized, so there are no uninsured.
Donning hard hats, the delegation also made its way through the site of Harlem U.S.A., a 285,000-square-foot shopping plaza that is expected to open by Christmas, before returning to Lenox Avenue, where a crowd had gathered.
Some wondered if Hillary Rodham Clinton was in town. When James L. Foster, 79, a retired carpenter, learned that Dutch officials were visiting, he asked, "How much money do they want?" He said the Prime Minister's visit would mean little to most Harlem residents. "How much can he learn in an hour?" he said.
But to Corey Murphy, 27, a security guard who lives and works on 124th Street near Lenox Avenue, the visit meant a lot. "It shows that we're coming up, that we are more business-oriented and that they're changing the neighborhood," he said. "I bet a few years ago the Prime Minister of the Netherlands wouldn't have set foot in Harlem."
Mr. Kok said he was impressed with Harlem's about-face. "Quite often outside the United States, Harlem still has the image of being so downward," he said. "The impression I take back is that people have found the way ahead."

The would-be renter, who looks to be your typical city skeptic, shrinks at the mere hint of a hard sell. Mr. Arno shrugs in an offhand way that seems to say, "Hey, no prob, it's your VCR," but he cannot let it go, either. "It's well acted," he adds. "Two Academy Award nominations."
The customer frowns and drifts away. Only in New York, it sometimes seems, can temporary custody of a Nick Nolte movie become the basis for a wholesale psychodrama. But then, when it comes to picking movies, New Yorkers can be as intense and demanding as auteurs, a lesson Mr. Arno has learned in the decade and a half that he has been renting videotapes from a slightly fraying and overcrowded storefront at the northern tip of Brooklyn Heights.
"Two things you hear over and over and over," he says, in a rare moment of calm on a recent Saturday afternoon. " 'What's new? What's good?' 'What's new? What's good?' "
These are words to live by in the fickle world of video rentals, and if the loyalty, diversity and numbers of his customers are any indication, Marty Arno is one of its leading citizens. With 17,000 films on his shelves, renowned for his extensive collection of movies foreign and cultish -- renters come from as far as Connecticut and New Jersey for his esoteric titles, and requests have been made from Britain, as well -- he operates what many consider the quintessential independent video store in New York.
A city of cineastes has spawned a network of shops to gratify its home viewing needs. From the Video Room in Battery Park City to the Video Station in Forest Hills, the stores have become the corner bars in the kingdom of film.
It's an establishment that has evolved the old-fashioned way: not as a product of an M.B.A.-generated company plan, but by adjusting its rhythms over time to the pulse of a neighborhood, by sussing out its peculiar tastes and quirks and tailoring its wares accordingly.
It is common knowledge that this way of doing business is in decline in many spheres of city life. For every Starbucks that hangs its forest green logo on the door to some refurbished former deli, for every drug chain superstore that barrels in with alpine stacks of vitamin bottles, the economic impact is felt in a funky nearby coffee shop with mocha-stained tables, or an ancient pharmacy with a druggist who has memorized your doctor's phone number.
Mom-and-pop video stores, too, can feel the heat from the big boys, which in the video business means Blockbluster, the nationwide chain that has 86 outlets in New York City. Mr. Arno's hedge against corporate hegemony -- Blockbuster has 24 stores in Brooklyn but no beachhead as yet on Mr. Arno's turf -- has been to burrow into the community, to make his store, and himself, as indispensable and responsive as he can to the 6,000 steady clients who buy the store's $25 annual memberships.
"I learned very quickly that this is an upscale neighborhood: they wanted Bergman, they wanted Fellini, they wanted Wertmuller," Mr. Arno says, listing three directors whose movies he displays in abundance along a vast wall of foreign flicks, considered by many one of the best such libraries in the city. How many video stores, after all, not only offer "Cries and Whispers," "Satyricon" and "Seven Beauties," but also "White Hell of Pitz Palu," a 1929 silent film about German mountaineering?
One would assume from the depth of the collection that Mr. Arno himself was a fan of cerebral cinema. One would assume wrong. Ask him about some hero of the art houses and see the conflicted cloud spread over his face. "I watch a Bergman film," Mr. Arno says, "and I want to jump off a bridge."
This comes as absolutely no revelation. I have been a customer of Mr. Arno's for as long as I have lived in Brooklyn Heights; acquiring my membership card was one of my initiatory acts of residency. I may not ever have known his last name; only in preparing this article did I learn that he had one, because to everyone who walks in his door on Henry Street, he is simply Marty. But no private detective was needed to determine that he preferred "Dr. Zhivago" to "The Seventh Seal." On a thousand occasions, as one store clerk or another was sliding my selections into a black plastic bag, I could hear Mr. Arno behind the counter delivering a glowing 10-second review of some golden oldie that starred Groucho Marx or Harold Lloyd. It was Mr. Arno in the role he was born to play, presiding over a library as entwined with his personality as Polanski's or Spielberg's is with a director's cut.
With its glorious autumn film festival, its penchant for the films of Rohmer, Kubrick and Kurosawa, and lately, its boom in multiscreen cinemas, New York is a city that takes its cinema to heart. "There's a reason the Angelika Film Center is here and not in Clifton, N.J." Michael Mark, a Manhattan video store owner, says of the haven for indie films on Houston Street. And a reason there are Marty Arnos in every borough of the city, holding court across a counter, offering tips on little-known titles, castigating recalcitrant returners with late fees.
"I would say that almost half my clientele will just walk in and say, 'What am I renting today?' " says Mr. Mark, a partner in Couch Potato, which has two stores on the Upper East Side. A lifelong movie addict, he is amazed sometimes at the trust clients invest in his taste, and at his platform for "tossing my opinions around." Especially since he's pretty sure that renting copies of "Jules and Jim" is never going to get him or his business partner, Tony Barnes, that elusive seaside retreat in the Hamptons.
"Neither one of us got into this with the idea that you can make a fortune in the video business," Mr. Mark says. "You can't. We're not just here making a buck. We're here because we love the medium of film."
The video store, a retailing phenomenon born as an enterprising response to the invention of the VCR, has expanded in two decades from niche business to mature industry. In the years in which Americans were adding the new appliance to their homes, rental revenues rose. Today 84 percent of households have VCR's, says the Video Software Dealers Association, the country's largest home video trade organization, and that has meant a tapering off of new members for video stores. As recently as 1997, the association notes in its latest annual report, the rental market in the United States declined by 4 percent. Improvements in technology create new challenges: cable television providers, for instance, added to the pressure on video stores with the proliferation of pay-per-view channels, and the advent of DVD players has compelled store owners to consider expanding their libraries in new directions.
Mr. Arno opened for business on Henry Street in September 1984, with a $25,000 investment, 400 cartridges and a slew of neighbors who didn't know a tracking dial from an eject button. "Nobody in the neighborhood had a VCR," he says. "People would walk in and ask what kind of books we had for sale."
Fifteen years later, they're still coming, except now they also drag in rickety old VCR's making odd noises and looking as worn out as Victrolas for Mr. Arno to try to repair. On many an afternoon, the proprietor of what is called North Heights Video on paper but Marty's on the street can be found with a screwdriver in his hand, prying a jammed cassette out of an over-the-hill machine while discussing the merits of "Gunga Din" with a browser.
"I've always loved the movies," says Mr. Arno, 59, who grew up in Bensonhurst but moved to Staten Island with his wife, Harriet, to raise a son and daughter. "On Saturdays when I was a kid, you spent all day in the movies." He remembers the dimly lighted celluloid palaces of his youth, the Walker and the Metro, where he watched serials and westerns and horror flicks. John Wayne was a personal hero, although it wasn't stars he came to worship. "It was," he says, "a great place to meet girls."
You wouldn't mistake Mr. Arno for one of those film nerds with the history of the camera angles of Sergei Eisenstein in their heads. Sure, he went to New York University, with its renowned film school, but he majored in marketing and advertising. After college he wound up under the Brooklyn Bridge, in the family's trucking and warehousing company, which he took over after his father's death. The oil crisis of the late 1970's soured him on trucks, so he sold the fleet. Later, his brother-in-law presented him with the idea for a partnership in a video store. Mr. Arno liked it. They found a vacant shop next to a Chinese restaurant and got their start in pictures.
Over the years, Mr. Arno shed the partner, moved to larger digs a block farther north adjoining another Heights culinary fixture, Henry's End, and completed the metamorphosis from scrappy transporter of the jeans of Sergio Valente to people's interpreter of the movies of Antonioni.
"I was open seven days a week at first, and that was a killer," he says. "But the business was steadily rising." The advent of premium movie channels on cable made a dent in his bottom line, as did a thriving cut-rate market others were carving out in bootleg videotapes. Still, Mr. Arno held his own on Henry Street, handing out doggie cookies to customers' pooches, running goofy rental promotions, like half-price "dead actress specials," and harboring secret fantasies about the ruination of picnics, ball games and street fairs.
"I pray for rain on a Saturday," he explains.
A recent Saturday was a particular downer for Mr. Arno: not a cloud in the sky. (A weakened if lucrative Tropical Storm Floyd had blown through that Thursday.) Still, the store, with its dingy carpeting and jetliner-narrow aisles, was filled that afternoon with the usual mix of movie shoppers, who picked up on the endless conversation Mr. Arno began during the Reagan era.
It's the busiest day of the six-day schedule his store now maintains. The movie clock never rests, but on Sundays, Mr. Arno does. Children huddle in front of the shelves of Disney selections. A young German woman appears to be cataloguing the foreign films, box by box. No one at the moment goes near the rack of XXX-rated shelves, which Mr. Arno says are kept off limits to minors. In the course of this typical Saturday, the store owner will schmooze, trouble-shoot, play a few practical jokes with phony winning lottery tickets and try to hold his tongue when a man half his age returns a movie late, claiming a hurricane exemption.
"You mean, I could get in here from Staten Island, but you couldn't make it five blocks?" Mr. Arno says in his best Brooklyn street-guy manner. "All right," he finally adds, with just the slightest edge in his voice, "we'll give you a hurricane credit."
After the man departs, one of Mr. Arno's assistants, Kathy Rusin, a Queens College student, points out that he has made similar claims before and was once even forgiven a $20 debt to the store. For the first time, Mr. Arno looks agitated. "Why didn't you tell me?" he says to Ms. Rusin, as a second assistant, Alana Garcia, a freshman at Pace, busies herself, signing out "Nixon" and "A Bridge Too Far." "Well, this is going to be the last time."
Mr. Arno walks to the front of the store, tugging on the unlit cigarette perched tightly between his teeth. What can he do? Building a store title by title, and customer by customer, who wants to turn into a leg breaker? "It's one of the reasons my wife doesn't come by much," he says.
A vast majority of Mr. Arno's members, however, do not begrudge him an extra $3 plus tax. (Although he produces a piece of paper with the names of hundreds of people who in some cases owe him hundreds of dollars.) The thousands in good standing want a steady stream of cheap fixes in front of the set. In America, that's entertainment.
"Who are these, the von Trapp family?" a man at the counter remarks as he stares at the illustration on the box for "Dancing at Lughnasa," the recent drama about five Irish sisters that featured Meryl Streep.
Mr. Arno is only too happy to weigh in on this one. He is a huge fan of what he calls "epic adventure movies," sweeping, eye-filling narratives like "The Man Who Would Be King" and "The Wind and the Lion." He also has a thing for funny, quirky little films such as "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead." Hitchcock's movies, he says, are year in and out the most reliably popular in his shop, "because he tells a good story masterfully; they all steal from him."
Conversely, the mention of a mistier offering, like "Terms of Endearment" or for that matter, "Dancing at Lughnasa," elicits the kind of pained expression that might have a solicitous bystander dialing 911.
"It's an opportunity for her to showcase her Irish accent," Mr. Arno says to the customer of Ms. Streep's performance in "Lughnasa." "They dance in a circle. I can't wait for the sequel, when they dance the other way around."
In his natural habitat, Mr. Arno is a strutting Leonard Maltin. "Do we have 'Female Waters' "? Ms. Garcia asks for a client. Mr. Arno looks confused. "You talking about 'Female Trouble' by John Waters?" he shouts back, breaking the code.
Another woman approaches. "Is 'Blow-Up' on video?" she wants to know. Mr. Arno shoots her an "is it ever" kind of look. "Yes, and do you know the name of the model -- who's the model in it?" he asks in reply. "Veruschka," he says, without waiting for an answer, "and you know, she's a customer here." As are, Mr. Arno says, the lawyer Barry Scheck, the actor Chris Eigeman and Steve Burns, the Steve of the Nickelodeon show "Blue's Clues."
Everyone deplores the decline in the quality of movies, but Marty's video hangout seems to improve with each addition to the collection. Quantity means almost as much as quality. One day soon, he may run out of space. "If it's on tape, I have it," Mr. Arno says.
"Well, that's a slight exaggeration," he adds. But not by much.

For Soft-Drink Makers, a Dry Spell

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
AS Coca-Cola's share price dropped below $48 in trading last week, from a high of over $88 last year, investors were wondering: Can it get any worse?
It is pretty bad, and not just for Coke, whose recent track record was described last week as "the most significant underperformance versus the S. & P. 500 in the history of the company" by Andrew J. Conway, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
 Pepsico's share price is languishing at $31.375, well below the company's 52-week high of $42.563. And Cadbury Schweppes, trading as American depository receipts, is at $27.4375, down from a high of $35.0625 within the last year. Bottlers like Pepsi Bottling Group, the Whitman Corporation and Coca-Cola Enterprises are getting clobbered, too.
What has happened to the soft-drink stocks? The answer is part global cautionary tale, part facts of life in the consumer products business.
Much of the downturn can be traced to the state of affairs at Coke, which began a sharp decline 14 months ago. "It starts at the top," said Caroline Levy, an analyst for Schroder & Company. "If Coke is weak, it's very hard for Pepsi as well as the bottlers."
Coke's frailty is rooted in macroeconomic conditions around the world that have gnawed at profits in a system designed when emerging markets were booming. In countries like Germany, Japan and Brazil, Coca-Cola's sales have been flat or falling for several years, largely because consumers in those countries do not feel they have the money to spend on what they perceive as a relatively expensive American product. So second-tier brands have been cutting into Coke's market share. In the United States, volume fell when bottlers raised prices 5 to 6 percent earlier this year. The idea was to regain profits lost during the last three years, when Coke and Pepsi waged a price war in the supermarket aisles.
"Now, rather than having the stimulus of lower prices, we're going to have the drag of higher prices," said Marc Cohen, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. Sales of store-brand soda have been creeping higher, too.
Some of the investor retreat from Coke's stock can be attributed to concern over the profitability of the two engines behind the Coca-Cola system. Coke's return on invested capital -- 35 percent -- is far higher than that of its biggest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is about 5.2 percent.
But even Coke's return on invested capital has been falling lately.
"We think, in the long run, it's a great company with great management, a great franchise and a great business model," said David Garza, an analyst at Roxbury Capital Management, which has sold most of its two million Coca-Cola shares since the beginning of the year. "The issue is the economics in the short run." He added, "Earnings growth is the worst it's been in decades."
 COCA-COLA'S recall of 17 million cases of its products in France and Belgium this spring has had more extensive repercussions than the company publicly anticipated. Sales are still shaky in Italy, Germany and Poland as a result of the recall, several analysts said.
There are also worries about the effects of currency devaluations abroad. And the company halted its share-repurchase program earlier this year.
Coke has said it will increase volume next year by 7 to 8 percent worldwide, and increase its earnings 15 percent to 20 percent. But analysts -- who are assiduously coached by Coke, but have been burned in recent months as the company has failed to meet its own earnings targets -- say that is an unreasonable expectation.
"We believe volume will grow 6 to 6.5 percent, and earnings per share will be up 13 percent," said Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
Coke's once-hallowed executive suite is also coming in for criticism. "What people are worried about is why they are missing their numbers," Ms. Levy said. "The question is, is that global economies? Or is that management?"
The falling stock price reflects worry about whether Coke and other global consumer products giants will ever again post the kind of profit growth they did through most of the 1990's.
"The emperor has fewer clothes now than I thought," said Daniel Peris, an analyst for Argus Research. He predicts that Coke's share price will return to a more traditional valuation, closer to the 71 percent premium to the S. & P. 500 price-to-earnings multiple that it averaged over the last seven years. In 1997, the premium was 96 percent, and in 1998, it rose to 106 percent. So far this year, the premium is about 83 percent, he said.
In the case of Pepsico, management difficulties in the soft-drink division are one cause of the stock's slide. But analysts say some investors' worries may be exaggerated, since the bulk of Pepsico's earnings are generated by its snack-food business. "Frito-Lay is easily one of the strongest consumer packaged-goods companies that can be found," Mr. Cohen said.
The unexpected departure last month of Philip A. Marineau, the former chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America, sapped confidence in Pepsico and its recently spun-off bottler, Pepsi Bottling Group, analysts say. "Part of P.B.G.'s selling proposition to Wall Street was that Pepsi-Cola was under more solid management," Mr. Cohen said. "And the management decided to leave."
The bottling company opened at $23 on March 31, rose to $25.25 in early July and was trading at $17.4375 on Friday.
Whitman, a major Pepsi bottler based outside Chicago, is down 44.5 percent for the year. It hit a 52-week low on Friday, trading at $14 a share.
Cadbury Schweppes has fared better, but is still down 20.6 percent for the year. Confusion about Cadbury's strategy, now that it has sold many of its operations outside the United States to Coca-Cola, hasn't helped.
The soft-drink sector has experienced what Mr. Conway calls "a mini-implosion" in recent weeks. "The question is," he said, "when will volumes return?"

Even if the Fed Is Idle, Rates Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
TO the relief of many investors, members of the Federal Reserve Board have made clear that they will not be voting to raise interest rates at their meeting next Tuesday.
So why are yields on United States Treasuries rising? The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 6.13 percent on Friday, from 5.97 percent a week earlier. 
 The obvious reason for the move was renewed inflation fears brought about by rising oil and gold prices. Adding to the anxiety was news on Friday that an index of prices paid by factories rose to its highest level in more than four years and that manufacturing grew faster in September than analysts had expected.
But investors who remain certain that bond yields will retreat again should take note. A pattern of unrelenting selling sweeping through the Treasury market in recent weeks is not caused by bad economic news alone.
Some of those doing the selling may be foreign investors who see the decline of the dollar hammering their returns. But Charles Peabody, bank analyst at Mitchell Securities in New York, says the bond market's behavior also reflects a broad unwinding of bets placed by investors who were later caught unware by recent interest-rate increases. Many of these positions are now going bad; as they are unwound, they push rates higher.
First was the so-called yen carry trade, in which investors borrowed funds in Japan at microscopic interest rates and bought Treasuries with the proceeds. When the yen spiked up, profits turned to losses and the Treasuries had to be dumped.
Last week's disastrous trade was a variation on this theme -- the gold carry trade -- in which investors bet that the price of gold will drop. They borrowed gold from a bank, sold the gold and bought Treasuries, making perhaps 4 percent on the difference between what they paid to borrow the gold and what they earned on the securities. With gold prices running up this week, those trades had to be unwound.
The gold carry trade is nowhere near as big as outright bets made on rates, known as interest-rate swaps, in which one investor agrees with another to exchange a fixed rate for a floating rate.
Interest-rate swaps account for more than 80 percent of derivatives held at American banks. In the second quarter, the notional value of interest-rate related derivatives at domestic banks stood at $25.7 trillion, up 28 percent from the corresponding period in 1998. As rates climb higher, these holdings become worrisome.
At the same time, Mr. Peabody believes that we are starting to see the ill effects of rising rates on the nation's financial institutions. "Because of the positive reinforcement of declining rates over the last two decades," he said, "most financial players have increasingly used that trend as a way of boosting their profits."
Now, the reverse is happening. In recent weeks, three small banks -- Keystone Financial Inc., the Regions Financial Corporation and Flagstar Bancorp -- have warned of earnings shortfalls owing to higher rates.
Will rates rise further? "Any time you get a trend reversal in the discount rate, that trend remains in force on average for 14 months," Mr. Peabody said. "August represents the first month of a trend reversal."

The Unsung Comeback of the Large Car

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
AS the 2000 model year arrives, sport utility vehicles have captured the hearts and garages of millions of Americans, while sales of large cars and minivans are lagging.
But many in the auto industry say there is an untold story: large cars and minivans have been greatly improved. They actually do as well as or better than sport utility vehicles by many of the criteria American buyers have long considered most important. These include price, performance, passenger comfort and, perhaps most surprisingly, safety. 
 The height and sturdy appearance of sport utility vehicles make them seem safer than cars to many buyers. But in crashes, people in the latest large cars and minivans are less likely to die than people in all but the very largest sport utility vehicles, according to an insurance industry analysis to be released this month. Even the very largest sport utilities have death rates only slightly lower than those of large cars and minivans, yet are far more likely to kill occupants of other vehicles in crashes.
The safety comparison goes beyond death rates. Recent Federal crash tests show that large cars like the Ford Crown Victoria and Chevrolet Impala, and minivans like the Honda Odyssey and Ford Windstar, provide more protection than large sport utility vehicles like the Dodge Durango and the Cadillac Escalade. In fact, sport utility vehicles have received many of the worst scores in recent tests and are more likely to roll over than cars or minivans, according to a Federal study last summer.
Other factors that are important to buyers also favor large cars and minivans over more popular sport utilities.
Consider price. Auto makers sell large cars and minivans at thin profit margins and often offer rebates. They tack markups of $5,000 on pickups and of $10,000 to $15,000 on large sport utility vehicles, often with no rebates.
Consider performance. The typical large car can now accelerate from zero to 60 miles an hour in 9.2 seconds, almost 2 seconds faster than a large sport utility vehicle, according to Government figures. And because large cars are lower and lighter, they tend to be more nimble and to brake more quickly, especially on wet surfaces. Minivans, which are built like large cars but with taller passenger compartments that produce more wind resistance, roughly match large sport utility vehicles in acceleration times and handle better, though not quite as well as cars.
Consider spaciousness. Large cars and minivans offer leg room and shoulder room similar to that of sport utility vehicles for passengers in the front two rows of seats, and almost as much headroom. Minivans also provide a third row of seats, as large sport utilities do.
Most Americans care little these days about their vehicles' fuel economy or emission of air pollutants, industry surveys show. But on these criteria, too, large cars do far better than sport utility vehicles, while minivans tend to be in the middle.
Strict Government standards for cars have forced auto makers to design large cars that now get up to 32 miles a gallon on the highway. That is double the mileage of some of the biggest sport utility vehicles, which are allowed by law to be considerably less fuel efficient. Cars of all sizes also emit less than half the volume of smog-causing gases for each mile that most large sport utility vehicles do. (Ford now builds its sport utilities to pollute no more than cars.)
People who know automobiles usually say that big cars offer a better combination of driving performance, affordability and roominess than other large vehicles. "I would steer most families toward a large sedan because they provide the best cross-section of capabilities," said Csaba Csere,editor in chief of Car and Driver magazine.
Even auto makers, wealthy from sport utility profits, acknowledge that big cars are underappreciated. "Trucks are not as nimble, they're not as light, and if you don't have the need for the load-carrying capability or the three rows of seats, the passenger cars are a great value and a lot of fun to drive," said Ronald Boltz, a senior vice president at DaimlerChrysler A.G.
To be sure, large cars have two substantial disadvantages when compared with sport utility vehicles: they have less cargo space, and they are not as tall. These days, Americans increasingly like riding up high, or at least dislike being in short automobiles when motorists around them are driving taller models.
Still, the many advantages of the latest large cars and minivans have not been much help to the people who market them because to many Americans these products are something worse than less safe, less economical or less nimble: They are out of fashion.
 
The S.U.V. Advantage
The Growing Appeal Of Riding High
Not so long ago, children liked to play with model sports cars and dreamed of the day when they might drive the real things. But auto industry market researchers now say that the younger a person is, the more enthusiastic he or she is about sport utility vehicles. That could shape the auto market for many years to come.
When DaimlerChrysler held promotional events for its cars and for its Jeeps recently in a Detroit suburb, visitors to the car promotion mostly had gray hair or were balding. The Jeep display across the street, which included an off-road driving course, was full of families with children. Milo Perreault, an 11-year-old from Shelby Township, Mich., ogled the sport utilities and spoke wistfully of the long wait until he would be old enough to drive. "I'd actually like a Jeep," he said. "Some of the sports cars, like the Viper, are low to the ground, and in a Jeep I like the height."
Until recently, market researchers did not even ask about height. Now surveys show that visibility from the driver's seat ties a vehicle's driving performance and interior comfort as the most important attributes that buyers seek.
The taller sport utilities do well on this score, especially the new Ford Excursion. It has just replaced the Chevrolet Suburban as the world's largest sport utility vehicle, and at 6 feet 8 inches, it allows tall drivers to look over the roofs of Suburbans. Excursion drivers must climb two tall stairs and a short one just to get in to the vehicle.
Mary Cumberland, 76, who drives a big 1997 Chrysler New Yorker and lives in Southfield, Mich., said she had always driven large cars. But she was not sure that she wanted another because she was tired of having other vehicles block her view of the road. "A lot of people are considering sport utilities just out of self-defense," she said. "I'm trying to get my husband to consider a van, to be up higher."
The latest cars are low and streamlined, making them very stable as well as reducing wind resistance and improving fuel efficiency. But the seats and door openings in large cars are lower than they were a generation ago.
Fashion and seating height have contributed to the recent stagnation in sales of large cars and minivans. Sales of large cars have tumbled to 4 percent of the overall market, from 10 percent in the early 1980's and from close to half the market in the 1960's.
Minivan sales, which had been hot and growing rapidly as recently as the early 1990's, have now leveled off, and actually lost some of their share of all new vehicles sold, falling to 8 percent last year.
Sales of sport utility vehicles, of course, have been soaring. Though their annual growth rate peaked in 1996, the big vehicles have still been the fastest-growing segment of the auto market every year since 1994. Sport utility vehicles now account for a majority of the luxury auto market and almost a fifth of the overall market, up from less than 2 percent of each in the early 1980's.
 
Safety
A Tougher Look But a Weaker Record
Just by looking at sport utilities, some Americans conclude that they are safer than cars and minivans. Their rugged, even intimidating, appearance seems to remind buyers of the safety advantages of size, an advantage that Americans used to forget in buying small cars, said Adrian Lund, an insurance industry safety researcher.
But recent research by the Government and the insurance industry shows that, contrary to popular perception, sport utility vehicles do not keep their occupants any safer than cars or minivans, or even as safe in many cases.
For example, large cars and minivans are increasingly winning the Government's highest, five-star rating for driver protection in a frontal crash, but not one sport utility vehicle has won the highest rating for such protection. And some of the worst safety scores in crash tests have gone to sport utilities.
Moreover, the Government assigns stars without assessing an automobile's propensity to roll over. Sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks fared worst in a Federal study last summer that looked at vehicles' tendency to roll over.
The new insurance industry analysis, which included Federal data on every fatal crash reported in the United States last year, finds that 106 occupants of large cars like the Impala and smaller minivans like the Dodge Caravan died in crashes for every million registered vehicles of those types. By comparison, 131 occupants of large sport utility vehicles like the Dodge Durango died in crashes for every million registered automobiles of those types.
For the very largest sport utility vehicles, like the Chevrolet Suburban and the Lincoln Navigator, the death rate was slightly lower than for large cars, at 93, while for midsize sport utility vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chevrolet Blazer it was much higher, at 151.
The smaller minivans, like the Caravan, ended up being included in the large car category in the study because they were similar in wheelbase and construction and behaved similarly in crashes. Bigger minivans, like the Windstar and Odyssey, wound up in the very large car category, which also includes Lincoln Town Cars and which had a death rate of 107.
Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said sport utility vehicles were no safer for their occupants than other types of automobiles. "It has become a popular myth that the S.U.V. is bigger and better, but we're very concerned that people understand the tradeoffs," said Dr. Martinez, a former emergency room physician. "It's taller, and that may help it in some kinds of crashes, but it also makes it more likely to roll."
Indeed, while people in sport utility vehicles die at least as often as people in cars and minivans, they tend to die differently. With minivans and cars, the fatalities tend to occur in collisions with other vehicles, especially sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. But with sport utilities, deaths come relatively more often when the vehicle rolls over.
Sport utility vehicles also tend to provide much less protection for occupants than cars during collisions with solid objects, as when a vehicle slides on a slippery road and hits a bridge or tree. Data from recent Government crash tests into solid barriers also strongly suggest that sport utilities provide poor protection during collisions with other sport utilities, although regulators say they have never crashed sport utilities together to check.
Sport utility vehicles fare better than other types of vehicles in collisions with cars. The height and weight of a sport utility vehicle allow it to pass over the strongest parts of a car and penetrate deep into it, so that the car and its occupants absorb the brunt of the crash, according to recent studies by regulators.
But Dr. Martinez and other safety experts say it is a mistake to be concerned only about collisions with cars. Indeed, surveys have found that most drivers think their own driving skills are far above average, and do not pay adequate attention to the possibility that they will make mistakes themselves or encounter poor driving conditions, like icy roads. Single-vehicle crashes account for nearly half of all fatal accidents.
Rollovers represent the biggest problem for sport utilities, causing more than a third of all deaths in those vehicles, compared with only a tenth of the deaths in cars. Recent Federal research has found very few cases in which vehicles roll over because their owners swerve violently on a road. Instead, according to Federal research backed by auto makers' own findings, 92 percent of rollovers occur after a vehicle has been "tripped" by striking a curb, guard rail or another vehicle, or catches the wheels on one side in the dirt or mud of a road's shoulder.
Drivers should be concerned about all types of crashes, and not just the possibility that a bad driver will crash into them, Dr. Martinez said.
In addition to protecting their own occupants better than most sport utilities do, large cars and minivans pose less hazard to other motorists. They are only a third as likely to kill the other driver in a crash as large sport utilities are, according to a study to be published in the winter issue of the Journal of Crash Prevention and Injury Control. The height, stiffness and weight of sport utilities account for the difference, according to the study, which was written by W. Thomas Hollowell, a senior Federal researcher, and his former aide, H. Clay Gabler, now in academia.
William Powers, Ford's vice president for research, said in a speech on Aug. 5 that in the years ahead, motorists will "see increasing diversity in vehicle size, raising further issues in occupant protection, vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility and pedestrian protection."
"There is a lot of work yet to be done," Mr. Powers said.
 
Other Criteria
A Higher Price For Sitting Tall
A few years ago, before tall automobiles became more common and made visibility from the driver's seat an issue, Americans shopped for the roomiest, best-handling vehicles at the best prices. If that were still true, dealers would have trouble keeping cars and minivans in stock.
Large cars, minivans and big sport utility vehicles all cost around $20,000 for carmakers to build, and a little more if they are luxury models with lots of leather and fancy gadgets like navigational computers.
But while many large cars and minivans sell for under $26,000, three-quarters of the nation's sport utility vehicles sell for more than $26,000. The difference, analysts say, lies in the manufacturers' fatter profit margins on sport utility vehicles.
Large cars and minivans offer seats that are just as roomy and comfortable as sport utility vehicle seats -- more comfortable, if the bumpy ride of sport utilities is considered. While large cars these days may look smaller on the outside than the big sedans of the 1970's, they are just as spacious on the inside. And while the trunks of large cars may not accommodate tables and chairs, the cargo areas of minivans do.
Minivans have as much cargo room behind the second row of seats as all but the largest sport utility vehicles, industry statistics show. And because the second row of seats in most minivans can be removed, while the second row in most sport utility vehicles can only be folded down, minivans are actually the roomiest vehicles for people with very large possessions to move.
Many television advertisements show cars swooping through tight curves on mountain roads. Ads for sport utility vehicles seldom show this, for a good reason: sport utility vehicles are less maneuverable than cars, or even minivans.
Car and Driver magazine tests vehicles by having them swerve over one lane to the left and then swerve back into their original lane, as though circumventing an obstacle. The magazine found last year that family sedans could accomplish the maneuver safely at average speeds up to 63.4 miles an hour, and minivans up to 57.9 miles an hour; for luxury sport utility vehicles, the average was 53.9 miles an hour.
Mr. Csere said sport utilities' high centers of gravity, high weight and off-road tires gave them inferior handling. "S.U.V.'s are clearly worse than cars of any kind, whether small or large," he said.
The sheer weight of sport utilities vehicles also makes them harder to stop than cars or minivans, especially on wet or snowy roads. Indeed, Thomas Davis, General Motors' group vice president for light trucks, said that, contrary to popular perception, four-wheel drive does not help vehicles stop, nor does it help them maneuver while braking.
In spite of the ways they compare favorably with sport utilities, large cars and minivans suffer from an image problem. Despite considerable improvements over the last five years, especially in driving performance, minivans in particular are unfairly derided, said Ralph Sarotte, DaimlerChrysler's general manager for minivans.
"Someone put the 'soccer mom' title on them, and a lot of people don't want that image," he said. "We could sell twice as many minivans in this market if it were not for the image thing."
Exactly that "image thing" is what makes sport utilities so hot, auto executives say. "S.U.V.'s are about image," said Joseph C. Collins Jr., Ford's brand manager for sport utilities and minivans. "It's about who that customer is and who that customer wants to be."
 
A Tale Hangs in the Test Numbers
(DETROIT) -- BIG cars and minivans produce sterling performances in Federal crash tests. Large sport utility vehicles, which tend to be modified pickup trucks with very stiff bodies that absorb little energy in a crash, often fare worse.
When regulators crashed a new Chevrolet Impala sedan into a concrete and steel barrier at 35 miles an hour recently, the dummy in the driver's seat escaped largely unscathed. Measured on a point scale in which 500 reflects a 1-in-25 chance of a life-threatening injury and 1,000 indicates a greater than 1-in-6 chance, the dummy in the Impala test suffered only 322 points' worth of harm.
By contrast, when a big Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle with four-wheel drive took the same test last December, the dummy in the driver's seat suffered head injuries scored at 1,008, as well as severe chest injuries. It was the worst score for driver's head injury of any recently tested vehicle and was particularly dismaying to regulators because it was the second time they had tested the Durango; DaimlerChrysler had made adjustments to the vehicle after it scored equally poorly in the first test a year ago.
"If I look at the truck, it's beautiful, but my gosh, it does let tremendous forces go into the dummy," said Richard Morgan, the group leader of the Government's New Car Assessment Program, which runs the tests.
The Government conducts a separate test at 30 miles an hour before letting any vehicle be sold in the United States. If the Durango had recorded the same head- or chest-injury scores on the slower test, it would have flunked and been ineligible for sale. But the slower test was never performed on the Durango; instead, the Government accepted DaimlerChrysler's assurances that the Durango was virtually identical to the Dodge Dakota pickup truck, which was tested and passed with good scores.
Sheila Gruber McLean, a DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman, said the company had done many of its own safety tests on the Durango, including the basic safety test at 30 miles an hour, and the vehicle had always passed. "We're confident this vehicle offers adequate protection for its occupants and meets all the standards it needs to meet, or exceeds them," she said.
Ms. McLean contended that Federal crash tests at 35 miles an hour are meant "to reflect a Durango hitting a Durango, which is a very rare crash." But regulators and the insurance industry disagree, saying the tests also simulate what happens when a vehicle hits a fixed object or another vehicle of similar size and weight.
The Durango was also rated "acceptable" in a somewhat different test for the insurance industry, in which a vehicle hits a barrier with its front, driver's-side corner, rather than with its whole front as in the Government test.
Other sport utility vehicles have somewhat better crash test scores than the Durango does for head and chest injuries, but do worse on potentially crippling leg injuries. The Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon Denali full-size sport utility vehicles have the worst scores for injuries to drivers' legs of any automobiles on the market that regulators have tested. The Jeep Grand Cherokee has the worst scores for injuries to front passengers' legs, according to raw data from recent Government tests.
By contrast, the Volvo S-70 sedan and V-70 wagon have the best scores on driver's head injury among currently available automobiles of any type, while the Ford Windstar minivan does best on chest injuries to drivers.
Sport utilities do better than large cars and almost as well as minivans on side-impact tests that the Government recently began conducting. Such side-impact crashes, although often deadly, are much less common in the real world than frontal crashes. KEITH BRADSHER

Large cars like the Chevrolet Impala, the newest model on the market, are not as popular as big sport utility vehicles like the Dodge Durango, but have many advantages. Big cars tend to be safer, more nimble, more fuel-efficient and cheaper. But they also tend to have less cargo room and are lower, so drivers have trouble seeing around taller vehicles.

Graphs: "How the Vehicles Compare"
Auto makers have improved large cars and minivans to satisfy buyers' demand for affordability, roominess and safety while meeting increasingly strict fuel economy standards. Now, by many of these criteria, large cars and minivans compare favorably with sport utility vehicles. But cars and minivans are not as tall at a time when buyers increasingly want to sit higher. Figures are for the 2000 model year, except as noted. The graph compares Large Sedans, S.U.V.'s, Minivans, Wagons, and Pickups.

"How Safe Are They?"
The height and sturdy appearance of sport utility vehicles make them seem safer than cars to many buyers. But people in large cars and minivans die less frequently in crashes than people in all but the very largest sport utility vehicles. On the other hand, large sport utilities are roughly three times as likely as large cars or minivans to kill occupants of the other vehicle in a crash. The graph compares occupants killed in crashes. In 1998, for each one million registered vehicles one to three years old. Another graph shows the people killed in other vehicles. For each 1,000 crashes involving two vehicles reported to the police, from 1992 through 1996.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Grand Old Spending Party

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN life's rich pageant, few spectacles are as dizzying as watching Congress spend the public's treasure. The sums are huge, the oratory windy, the techniques tricky as three-card monte.
As the old fiscal year ended and the new one began Friday, Congress was playing a giant shell game, saying one thing, doing another, and all the while juggling more than half a trillion dollars, leaving a huge stack of spending bills undone and the Government running on three weeks of legislative life support. 
 What is going on here is no carnival. There is a crossroads coming between the old ways of Congress and a new way, a trail still unblazed.
Just as this dimming decade, the post-cold war era, is defined by what it is not, the Republicans running Congress keep defining themselves by their opposites. Democrats tax and spend, they say; we cut taxes and spending. But they cannot this year; the green eyeshade of accountability doesn't fit.
The Republicans have promised -- publicly, daily, fervently -- not to finance the operations of the Government by spending money out of the Social Security trust fund. No Congress has done this since 1967.
To try to keep this pledge, they have used every accounting device in the book, and some previously unrecorded.
More than $20 billion dollars, nearly twice the previous record, is being drawn down from the ledger for fiscal 2001. A nearly equal amount is simply being erased from the books by a device known as "directed scorekeeping," which one respected Federal budget analyst, Stan Collender of the Fleishman-Hillard public relations firm, defines as "lying about the numbers." Venerable projects like the decennial census ($4.5 billion), a home-heating assistance program ($1.1 billion), agricultural aid ($8.7 billion at last count), along with still-uncounted billions for defense, have been deemed unforeseeable "emergency spending" -- meaning Congress can pretend they do not really count against the bottom line.
"This is subterfuge," said John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
But there was more, much more, as the millennial fiscal year 2000 began. On the floor of the House, members of Congress almost unanimously passed a non-binding resolution -- a promise made with fingers crossed -- pledging never again to spend a dime of the Social Security surplus.
Down the street, at that minute, their number-crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office were calculating that they were in fact spending $18 billion of the surplus, a number growing with every closed-door conference.
AND at the very moment President Clinton was signing into law a pay increase for members of Congress averaging $4,600 a year, Republican strategists were figuring that the only way to avoid spending the surplus was to delay a tax break for 20 million Americans on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.
None other than Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican standard-bearer, denounced the idea, saying, "I don't think they should balance their budget on the backs of the poor."
House Republican leaders figured that by delaying that tax break, they could say with a straight face that they would be $400 million shy of dipping into the Social Security coffers. At the same time, behind closed doors, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, was convincing them to add $500 million for an aircraft carrier to be built at his home state's shipyard.
Most ennobling of all was the speechifying in the well of the House as Representative Wally Herger, a California Republican, led the charge for the vote resolving not to spend the Social Security funds.
"What we are trying to do is break the addiction that we have had," he said, and sat back as Democrats ridiculed him.
"The gentleman from California ought to get the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor for being picked to drag this mother out here," said Representative Jim McDermott of Washington. The minority leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri, said it was like "saying we're going to quit drinking while we pour out a beer."
The resolution passed, 417-to-2. For the record, all the above voted for it.
It was barely two years ago that Congress overwhelmingly passed the Balanced Budget Act, which the President called a monument and Mr. Lott hailed as "the beginning of a new era of freedom." The act helped balance the budget, all right, although the tax revenues generated by a roaring economy were the key. They created what would have been the first real surplus in general Government funds in 30 years.
For each of those 30 years that the Government ran in the red, Congress has used the money from Social Security revenues to make up the difference. But now the spending limits, or caps, imposed by the Balanced Budget Act have cut spending on domestic programs, excluding the military, to their lowest level, expressed as a percentage of the overall economy, since 1962.
This relative penury in boom times proved intolerable for many Republicans. They have drained the once-in-a-generation general Government surplus and are about to draw down the Social Security funds.
Though the Democrats express shock and dismay at the Republicans' spending practices, things were arguably worse in many of the 40 years between 1954 and 1994, when Democrats controlled Congressional spending panels and became skilled at extracting Federal dollars for their own districts.
THE pressures on the Republican leaders to spend more money than they have on hand continue. The Pentagon consumes half the money they will spend this year, and what's left is not enough to divide between members clamoring for money to distribute to constituents, and popular programs like education, health care and medical research.
The path from the past that no one has charted is how to spend money wisely in a coming era of surpluses, linking public policy to public funds, instead of the present gathering at the Federal trough.

HEADLINE: The World;
50 Years Made China Change. But Not the Fear of It.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE imagery China chose to send around the world as it celebrated the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic on Friday seemed a throwback to Communism's brighter days: Half a million troops and citizens on parade, endless columns of missiles and armor, fighters and bombers screaming overhead. It was enough to make an old China hand like John Paton Davies, now 91, wonder whether the ever-emotional dynamic between the United States and China was headed into "another era in which we fear the Dragon."
The days when Mr. Davies and his State Department colleagues were purged in the peculiar madness of the McCarthy era for arguing that the Chinese Communists would be around for a while seem as remote today as pre-revolutionary Beijing. But the underlying fear that rattled the country in those years -- later to take the form of oscillating uncertainty about how to think about China and the kinds of threats it might pose -- has really never lifted. 
 "It was a mystery to me back in 1952," Mr. Davies said, his voice now whispery. "And it is still a mystery to me today. Our infatuation with China -- whether it is a potential enemy or a dear friend to be protected and indulged -- hasn't changed all that much."
Americans like to think they have a far clearer, more balanced view of China today than they did when Washington was seized with the question of who lost it, as if it was in America's power to win or lose. But ask the old China hands, and they will tell you that the pendulum of public opinion about China swings as vigorously as ever.
Tales of nuclear spies, and threats that China, if pushed, would resort to force to prevent Taiwanese independence rekindle wariness of a fearsome power whose real intentions seem forever cloaked.
But opposite images of a New China also spilled across the screen last week: jammed Internet cafes in Beijing, screaming stock traders in Shanghai, the cell-phone middle class in Guangdong taking the kids to soccer. Stitched together, those paint a comforting mosaic: a Chinese people that has -- finally -- become more and more like Americans.
Both images, of course, carry more than a little truth, and suffer from more than a little exaggeration. But they are also the yin and yang driving Washington's "engagement" policy -- usually driving it in circles.
If you ask the old China hands --- men like Mr. Davies who traveled the Chinese countryside as Mao battled the Nationalists -- the popular imagery Americans have of China has almost always been out of sync with the reality.
The enormous fear that China and the old Soviet Union would team up against America masked a bitter split between the two. Yet it seized Washington until the two countries actually began firing on each other in the 1960's. Then, in 1972, the exuberance around President Richard M. Nixon's visit largely ignored the death and terror of the Cultural Revolution. And the rush to invest in China's booming economic growth in the '90's masked the depths of its economic troubles -- the billions in bad loans, the wildly inefficient state-owned industries, the tens of millions of unemployed.
"We've so often deceived ourselves," said Culver Gleysteen, who grew up as the son of missionaries in Beijing and who, on Oct. 1, 1949, was among the few American diplomats left in China -- Vice Consul in the port of Dalian. Talking from his home in Boothbay, Me., Mr. Gleysteen said that in the years just after China changed hands "everyone in the State Department knew Chiang Kai-shek was a loser and we had to think about dealing with the Communists."
BUT Mr. Gleysteen recalls that his questions about engaging Mao prompted Walter J. Robertson, the Under Secretary of State for Asian affairs, to ask, "Is that young man Red?"
These days the arguments about how to deal with China are only occasionally tinged with questions of loyalty. But America's allies still worry about the periodic swings of views about China.
"I think it comes from the fact that the U.S. is so idealistic," said Kunihiko Saito, who has just ended a stint as Japan's Ambassador here. "So you become far more disappointed than we Japanese do when China does not act according to American standards."
It is possible that America is finally shedding some of its illusions. The companies that poured investment into China are pulling back, recognizing that the market that they thought would be the way to near-instant riches will, in fact, be a long slog. The think-tanks are consumed by a debate over two very different China threats: The China that gradually builds up its now small arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles or the China that risks an economic implosion that could set off the next Asian crisis. For every article about whether China will try to retake Taiwan there is another asking whether it will be the next Indonesia.
"There are, of course, people who fear a resurgent China, and China itself still fuels those fears," said Robert Suettinger, who spent his career China-watching at the Central Intelligence Agency. "But sort of backwards and by mistake we are moving toward a more realistic view, one that can avoid the ups and downs. We have to learn to live with great powers that are not our friend, but not our enemy either."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Hazy In Havana

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
Walking through the Partagas cigar factory in Old Havana is like smoking a box of Cohibas without ever having to light up. You just breathe deeply as you follow the raw tobacco leaves from the lower floors where they are separated into different qualities, to the upper floors where they are rolled into different brands, to the taste-test table, where our guide, Teresa, has the job of smoking different cigars all day for quality control. The best cigar rollers make about $15 a month, an average Cuban wage. Upstairs, at a raised table in front of a room with 100 men and women rolling cigars, sits the "lector," who entertains the workers by reading aloud all day -- newspapers in the morning, a Cuban novel in the afternoon.
There is one bit of news everyone in the factory would like to hear -- news they are sure could change their lives and make their business explode: that Cuban-American relations have been restored and the U.S. boycott of Cuba, and Cuban cigars, has been lifted. "What that would mean for the cigar business," says Teresa, her eyes wide, "Imaginate! Imagine!" 
 A week in Cuba teaches you that sooner or later most every conversation with a Cuban gets to this question: When might America restore relations? Cubans know that no real opening of their system is on the horizon, so only something from over the horizon might do it.
Why? Well, it's like this. For 30 years Fidel Castro had a bargain with the Cuban people: the Communist state provided all the basics of a job, education and health care, and the Cuban people provided the state with blind allegiance. But given the limitations of the Cuban economy, and the pain of the U.S. embargo, that bargain was only sustainable with the help of $6 billion a year in Soviet aid. When the U.S.S.R. collapsed after 1989, so did the aid.
In order to survive, the regime has had to open up a little to tourism, a little to free enterprise -- people can have restaurants in their homes, but with only 12 seats -- and a little to foreign investment. But only a crack -- because the regime knows that if people become independent of the state economically, they will become independent politically, and that will not be tolerated.
As result, what you have in Cuba today is what I would call "one party, no system." Cubans have the worst of all worlds: they have neither the cradle-to-grave, Soviet-financed welfare state of old nor the free-market, do-whatever-you-can-to-improve-yourself-just-don't-mess-with-the-regime system China has opted for.
Cuban officials insist there is a logic to their system and that growth is coming: "Our choice does not lie between the U.S. and China models," said Cuba's Vice Minister of Economic Planning, Alfonso Casanova Montero. "You can't compare us to China. China is not blockaded by the U.S. We are bent on avoiding a process of de-socialism. Given the aggression we have to constantly face from the U.S., if the income of our nation were deconcentrated, and if our political structure were deconcentrated, we would be much more vulnerable to foreign pressure. So the pressure from the U.S. has just the opposite effect on us than is intended."
But, in reality, this tight Cuban system clearly can't take care of its people's needs -- ration books get you through half the month. Yet it won't unleash them to freely lift their living standards. So, many Cubans are forced to take second jobs, depend on relatives abroad or engage in illegality. This is a shame, because there is enormous talent here. If unleashed, this place would be the Taiwan of the Caribbean, overnight.
But it's not being unleashed. Cuba's economy is a hodgepodge of Castroism and Thomas Cook tours, Canadian investment and central planning, Pepsodent billboards interspersed among Che Guevara propaganda billboards. The system produces enough income not to collapse, but not enough to really go forward. All the talk is about what they've been, not what they might become. So the place just treads water, a threat only to itself. And that's why people are hoping the U.S. will take the initiative, which it should. Cuba's people have suffered enough from being the rope in the U.S.-Castro tug of war.
And what if the U.S. doesn't move? "Political reform" is most unlikely here. The only hope is probably "biological reform," i.e. the passing away of the charismatic revolutionary generation in Cuba -- and its virulent Cuban exile opponents in Florida -- which might finally unlock the stalemate in Cuban-American relations. Imaginate!

HEADLINE: Housing Shortage

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"In Home Ownership Data, a Hidden Generation Gap" (Economic View, Sept. 26) did not discuss how to improve home-ownership rates for those under age 55. 
 The supply of housing is artificially limited because of exclusionary zoning policies. Such policies require minimum lot sizes, driving up the costs of housing, and they prevent builders from constructing the smaller units on smaller lots that young families can afford. Allowing the market to function more freely would allow lower- and modest-income Americans to afford so-called starter homes.
Allowing greater density where it is needed would expand property rights. Perhaps more important, it would preserve dwindling natural areas. Requiring minimum lot sizes maximizes the number of acres consumed by development in outlying regions.

The Screech of a Broken Record

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
Investors took the measure of the largely negative third quarter that ended on Thursday -- and sighed. They swallowed hard on Friday after hearing further condemnation of the surging economy.
 In the last month, the rat-a-tat-tat of stronger-than-expected economic reports has been drowned out by the clarion call of analysts warning of possible interest-rate increases. 
 Friday was no exception, as stocks fell after the Commerce Department reported that personal income and personal spending rose in September while personal savings sank to new lows. Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Management said that the nation's manufacturing sector grew more than expected in September and that the prices of raw materials climbed to the highest level since May 1995.
 Though most analysts have been saying the Federal Reserve will not raise rates on Tuesday, the reports were enough to raise fears and continue the cycle.
 The income and spending report knocked the market down, Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards & Sons, told The Associated Press. "Then the N.A.P.M. was the bullet." Still, the markets were little changed for the week. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: Battle in Congress Over Milk Prices Pits East Against Midwest

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
For most families, the outcome of a battle in Congress over milk prices will mean just a few cents a week at the supermarket counter. But the livelihoods of tens of thousands of dairy farmers are at stake, and the issue has provoked a civil war between lawmakers from the East and those from the Midwest.
Normal allies like the liberal Democratic Senators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin are at each other's throats. Normal antagonists like Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Robert C. Smith, the Republican turned Independent from New Hampshire, are allies. 
 Down Pennsylvania Avenue, President Clinton is on one side and his wife, Hillary, the all-but-announced Senate candidate from New York, is on the other. Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, took one position when he was merely Mayor of New York, but he changed his mind when he began running for the Senate.
The issue "is all about economic self-interest," Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. That is apparent from conversations with family farmers in the warring regions.
David Krug, who has a 280-acre farm with about 75 cows in Owen, Wis., that has been in his family for 105 years, calculates that if a new pricing system developed by the Clinton Administration goes into effect, he might earn an additional $8,500 a year.
But 800 miles or so to the east, in Swanton, Vt., near the Canadian border, Paul Bourbeau, who has about 300 cows on a farm he runs with his wife and two grown sons, figures that changes in the system could cost him $16,000 to $18,000 a year.
Mr. Krug and Mr. Bourbeau are relatively prosperous, and unlike some of their neighbors, their farms will survive no matter how the political questions are resolved. "But it could make the difference between profit and loss," Mr. Bourbeau said, "the difference in whether you keep up the buildings and replace the piece of equipment you need."
At issue is a convoluted Federal milk-pricing system that was devised in 1937 to insure that fresh milk was available in all parts of the country. The minimum price that farmers can charge for milk is fixed monthly by the Department of Agriculture. The country is divided into 31 regions, and the set price is higher the farther the regions are from Eau Claire, Wis., historically the center of the dairy industry.
Developments in dairy technology, transportation and refrigeration have made the old system obsolete, but efforts to change it have always failed because the stakes are so high.
Then in 1996, Congress approved a law, called the Freedom to Farm Act, reducing and ultimately ending the subsidies for farmers who grow corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, wheat and most other crops.
Although the law retained the 60-year-old milk-price system, it instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a more market-oriented system by this year. The law also permitted the creation of the Northeast Dairy Compact, which puts a floor on the price of milk that goes into bottles in the six New England states. The compact is supposed to expire when a new Federal pricing policy is put into place.
Early this year, Mr. Glickman offered the Administration's new plan, which would reduce, though not eliminate, the regional differences in what farmers charge for milk. The plan will go into effect unless Congress blocks it.
"The safest thing for me to have done," the Secretary said in an interview, "would have been to reaffirm the status quo, but I thought it was important to have a more up-to-date policy."
The Agriculture Department maintains that if its plan had been in effect for the last 12 months, the average price farmers received for milk would have been 58 cents higher for each 100 pounds of milk they sold, or nearly 5 cents a gallon.
But some farmers would have benefited more and some would have been hurt. The politics of the matter turn on the prevailing view that the Administration's plan would be to the advantage of farmers in the upper Midwest and to the disadvantage of those in the East.
The Agriculture Department has calculated that its plan would lower the supermarket price of milk by an average of 2 cents a gallon nationally. The Consumer Federation of America figures that the New England compact caused the price of bottled milk to rise 15 cents a gallon. A study by the Office of Management and Budget found that consumer prices were 5 cents to 20 cents higher than they would be without price fixing.
Those calculations are difficult to prove conclusively and are disputed by organizations representing dairy farmers in the East.
Eastern lawmakers have spent the year scrambling to preserve the Northeast Dairy Compact regardless of what happens to the new pricing plan. Eastern seaboard states outside New England, including New York, want to join the price-fixing arrangement, and Southern states want to form a compact of their own.
In Congress, it is almost always harder to change something than to leave it alone, and the dairy system is no exception. A majority appears to be in favor of blocking the Administration's pricing plan and allowing the New England compact to continue. But the majority may not rule.
Last month, the House of Representatives voted, 285 to 140, to block the new pricing plan and leave the old one in effect. But the latest word is that a House-Senate conference committee has decided, under instructions from House Republican leaders, to drop the section blocking the pricing plan.
The Republican leaders say they are philosophically opposed to putting such policy in a spending bill. Their political opponents say that Representative Dick Armey, the majority leader, and Representative Tom DeLay, the whip, both Texans, are representing the interests of the Suiza Foods Corporation, the Texas holding company that is the country's largest dairy producer.
Senators from the Midwest and the Northeast say they will filibuster legislation that puts their dairy constituents at a disadvantage, and neither side seems to have the 60 votes necessary to break a filibuster.
Secretary Glickman said that if Congress approved legislation blocking his pricing plan, he would recommend that President Clinton veto it. But campaigning in dairy counties in upstate New York, Mrs. Clinton has opposed the Administration's plan.
Mayor Giuliani, who used to be against propping up the prices paid farmers on the ground that consumers in New York City would have to pay more for milk, announced in August that he had changed his mind and now sided with the farmers.
All this squabbling seemed about to end this week when the dairy compact was supposed to go out of existence. But a Federal judge in Vermont provided a respite by issuing a temporary restraining order preventing any change in Government policy until hearings in a related lawsuit.
As they prepare their farms for winter, Mr. Krug in Wisconsin and Mr. Bourbeau in Vermont are following the developments in Washington.
"I'm concerned about what it will mean for the younger farmers here," said Mr. Krug, who is 60.
Mr. Bourbeau, who is 40, said: "When I started farming here 17 years ago, there were seven farms on my road. Now there are only two left. This could make the difference to lots of people up here whether they stay in business."

HEADLINE: A Conversion At St. Vincents;
In Catholic Merger, Serving the Poor Means Courting the Affluent.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The trouble with being St. Vincents Hospital was best illuminated last month, when John Cardinal O'Connor found out he had a brain tumor. The Cardinal did not seek care at the hospital in Greenwich Village, but rather at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on the Upper East Side.
While it was perhaps surprising that the Cardinal -- who technically oversaw St. Vincents as Archbishop until recently -- chose to get care elsewhere, the choice underscored the basic reality that high-profile patients have never been the hospital's bread and butter. 
 Indeed, the central mission of all the region's Roman Catholic hospitals has historically been quite unambiguous: to serve their neighborhoods and to treat the very poor. Competition from the city's prestigious medical centers was hardly a consideration.
But recently, St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, the jewel among the city's Catholic hospitals, has found itself facing the same problems that public hospitals face: lower reimbursement rates from Government programs and managed care companies, shorter hospital visits by patients, and increased competition from the city's most renowned hospitals.
The choice became clear: merge with others and become more cost-efficient, or perish. So last summer, the hospital, along with Sisters of Charity Healthcare, a hospital on Staten Island, agreed to merge with the Catholic Medical Centers of Brooklyn and Queens. Overnight, the region's largest Catholic health care system was born, with eight hospitals and scores of other services under its wing.
"It was clear if the mission of the Catholic health care system was going to be maintained, we had to bring them together," said Dr. Karl P. Adler, chief executive of St. Vincents Hospital.
The merger will be the first of many acquisitions, the executives involved in it said. When the city is left with a half-dozen or so consolidated systems, as most health experts expect, these executives want to make sure that one of them is Catholic.
"This kind of merger reflects what has been happening in health care generally," said Robert Field, the director of the graduate program on health policy at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. "Only religious institutions thought they could hold out longer. But in the past four to five years, it has been more and more difficult for them to resist the pressures of operating like businesses."
While the new entity will face many of the challenges inherent in any hospital merger, like ironing out who gets to run various clinical departments and trying to haggle with managed care companies, it will also face its own curious conundrum.
On the one hand, the merger was arranged ostensibly to help each hospital continue to serve the city's poorest and sickest residents. On the other, to compete as a behemoth among prestigious academic medical centers, the new system will have to attract many more higher-paying patients. As Dr. Adler said, "You can't serve the poor without a margin."
The executives of the merged entity, to be known as St. Vincents Catholic Medical Centers of New York, are taking bold steps that were unheard of 10 years ago.
They are grabbing high-priced talent left and right: Dr. John A. Ambrose, the new medical director of the hospital's cardiovascular center, was snatched from Mount Sinai last year; Dr. Samuel Lang was plucked from New York-Presbyterian to head a surgery unit. The consortium's leaders are looking for a chief executive whose resume suggests a Jack Welch, General Electric's chairman. (Non-Catholics are welcome to apply.)
They hope to draw wealthier patients by continuing to build clinical centers, like the spanking new cancer center at St. Vincents, and a cardiac care unit that is already making inroads, the executives said. The idea is that the smaller hospitals will still serve as primary care centers, referring patients with more complex problems to Manhattan.
St. Vincents has always enjoyed a better reputation than many of the region's other Catholic hospitals; it is the only one connected to a medical school, and its AIDS program is one of the most advanced in the country. But it will have to work hard to lure patients from the Mount Sinais and the New York-Presbyterians.
"The question is, will they compete effectively?" asked Rich Sinni of Watson Wyatt, a benefits consulting firm. "Here in New York you have some of the most world-renowned teaching institutions that there are. And we are in a real consolidation of the industry, so they want to carve out their niche."
Catholic hospital consortiums have been formed in other parts of the country for the same economic reasons that secular hospitals have merged: to consolidate management of payrolls and to gain more negotiating power with suppliers, laboratories and, most notably, managed care companies.
Catholic medical executives have also decided that to protect their values, especially regarding opposition to abortion and assisted suicide, they are better off sticking together when possible.
"We have no choice to be in health care; it is part of who we are," said the Rev. Michael D. Place, president and chief executive of the Catholic Health Association of the United States. "And we will continue to adapt while preserving our traditions."
The church is no stranger to changes in health care; in many ways, it was ahead of the consolidation curve. Its role in American health care began 272 years ago when nuns and religious laywomen took it on as part of their mission to help immigrants, and church-sponsored hospitals resulted. Over the years, different religious orders built large health-care systems, often stretching across broad swaths of territory.
One of the country's largest groups, Catholic Healthcare West, based in San Francisco, has been rapidly acquiring hospitals. The consortium, which has 37 hospitals, has met with some success. Last summer, for example, it was able for the first time to persuade Blue Cross of California to increase its reimbursement rates for all of the group's hospitals, after threatening to drop the insurer.
But attempts to merge hospitals from far and wide have also had problems. Some have not performed as well as hoped, and when the distances between a consortium's parts are great, one hospital may have trouble referring patients to another. What is more, cost savings, which at first can be substantial, tend to dwindle.
"The fundamental problem of operating such a large organization is continuing to achieve the economies of scale and economic benefits," said Laura Jacobs, a vice president of the Camden Group, a health care consulting firm in El Segundo, Calif. She added: "Catholic systems by and large are financially strapped to begin with. They have less wiggle room."
Deborah Cantu, the spokeswoman for Catholic Healthcare West, said it ran into speed bumps in its rapid growth. "We doubled in size between '95 and '99; that kind of expansion really takes its toll on individuals," she said. Many employees had no idea whom they were working for, for instance. "You tend to let things go because you are too busy working on the next big deal," Ms. Cantu said. "We need to pay attention at each instance of what happens after the merger."
The executives at St. Vincents say their health care system has an advantage over those that are spread over vast distances. They are working with hospitals across a relatively small region rather than over state lines, and the system will be anchored by a single academic medical center rather than by many. Of course, they are depending on patients from Staten Island and Queens to come to St. Vincents for many services, although the hospital already draws many patients from other boroughs because it is close to major subway stations.
The new consortium, which awaits final state and Federal approvals, still faces the sticky issues of corporate culture. On paper, the merger of the St. Vincents portion, which is sponsored by the Sisters of Charity, with the Catholic Medical Centers of Brooklyn and Queens, which are part of the Diocese of Brooklyn, is a 50-50 deal. But St. Vincents, by virtue of its location, size and affiliation with New York Medical College, is the obvious clinical heart of the combined unit. This has the potential to ruffle some feathers.
"Doctors who have been on Staten Island all their lives have a paranoia about doctors at a big hospital," said Dr. Adler, the chief executive of St. Vincents Hospital. "We have to deal with that perception that we are taking over."
Sister Elizabeth Vermaelen, president of the Sisters of Charity, said that there are striking differences in the ways the hospitals in the consortium are run. "At St. Vincents, you have New York-trained and board-certified doctors, where in the other hospitals, there are a lot of doctors from the third world, many not board-certified," she said. "Sometimes it is the academic world versus the street world" in terms of expertise.
Who gets a seat on the board? Who will run certain departments? Where will all the resources go? "In a meeting of egos, there are some setbacks," said John DePierro, president of the Sisters of Charity hospital. "People didn't want to put hard issues on the table."
Competing with other medical centers is not the central goal, but the management team of the merged entity hopes that will be one of the results.
"At the present time, we no longer have the personnel to provide care without getting paid," Sister Elizabeth said. "We are not doing this to be competitive; we are doing this because we believe in the mission of Catholic health care. If we can't provide quality services, we may as well be out of business."

HEADLINE: Campaign Fund-Raising Is at Record Pace

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
If the phenomenal pace of political fund-raising continues, candidates for Federal office will spend about $3 billion in the 2000 campaigns, an increase of about $800 million from four years earlier, according to projections based on Federal Election Commission data.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has raised an unprecedented $56 million in just seven months, is hardly alone in reaping the benefits of this cash-flush political season. This year's fund-raising totals for House and Senate incumbents and the national political parties have shattered all records, easily exceeding the most optimistic projections of fund-raisers and political operatives. 
 By November 2000, the Congressional races alone could cost $1 billion, experts estimate.
Fund-raising for the Congressional elections is being bolstered by the intense fight for control of the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a six-seat majority. In the first six months of 1999, House incumbents raised $77.9 million, which is 47 percent more than they raised in the first half of 1997 and 88 percent more than they raised in the first half of 1995, according to Federal Election Commission statistics.
And soft money donations, the unlimited contributions to the parties for party-building activities, have increased 55 percent in the first half of 1999 over the same period in 1997. Soft money contributions are 75 percent higher this year than they were in the first half of 1995.
Experts project that there is likely to be at least $525 million in soft money contributed to the six major national political party committees by November 2000. That would be more than double the $262 million in soft money that was contributed to the parties in 1996.
As the Senate prepares to debate this month the merits of a sweeping campaign finance bill that would ban soft money, several campaign finance experts helped The New York Times project the total amount of money that would be raised by candidates and the national parties for the 2000 Federal elections.
Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a public policy organization here, assisted The Times by studying the pace of fund-raising in the first six months of 1999 and comparing it with the same periods in the past three election cycles.
Mr. Wertheimer estimated that the 2000 elections would cost nearly $3 billion, which he called "a conservative estimate." But he and others said that the figure very likely could exceed $3 billion, especially if campaign fund-raising continued at its current torrid pace.
"These are extraordinary numbers," said Mr. Wertheimer, who is an outspoken advocate of overhauling campaign finance laws.
"We're ending this century with oceans of political-influence money flooding our democracy and drowning out the voices of average citizens," said Mr. Wertheimer, who has accurately projected campaign costs for 20 years. "The historic idea we have contributed to the world, democratic self-government, is at risk here in our own country because of the corrupt campaign finance practices that pervade Washington."
Mr. Wertheimer said that fund-raising was up 95 percent in the House, but he estimated that the increase would be only 35 percent by November 2000. "Fund-raising in the first six months this year has been extremely intensive," he said. "But that doesn't mean this pace will sustain itself for two years."
Robert Steurer, an aide to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the Senate's most ardent opponent of limits on campaign contributions, did not dispute the $3 billion estimate, but added that the costs of campaigns had increased markedly.
Some campaign finance experts say it is very difficult to estimate at this stage how much money will be raised by the end of the election cycle in November 2000. There are too many variables, they say, and they cautioned that the projections could be gross overestimates or underestimates of the actual figures.
"It's throwing darts," said Kent Cooper, a former senior staff member at the Federal Election Commission who is the co-founder of a Washington research firm, Public Disclosure Inc., that operates a comprehensive research Web site (www.tray.com).
Fund-raisers and campaign finance experts offer several explanations, most not surprising, for the windfall this year.
Most of all, fund-raisers attribute their success to the booming economy, saying that the nation's prosperity makes it easier for more people to write checks of $1,000, the maximum an individual can give to one candidate.
"People feel flush," said Herbert E. Alexander, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Southern California who has written extensively on campaign finance trends. "People have enormous paper profits from the stock market boom, and the technology people are suddenly millionaires and billionaires. I just think there is a lot of money around, and people want to use it to influence the process."
Another possible explanation for the early fund-raising pace is the early Presidential primary schedule, in which most of the major primaries will be over by late March. The earlier schedule has added to the perception among fund-raisers that they have less time to raise more money.
Larry Makinson, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said he agreed with the estimate that $3 billion would be spent on the 2000 elections. "A 50 percent increase from 1996 sounds right to me," he said. He also agreed with the projection that at least $1 billion would be raised and spent on the Congressional elections.
"Competition breeds the appetite for money," Mr. Makinson said. "It's impossible to imagine higher stakes. You have the real tangible potential for the Republicans to control all three branches of Government -- the Presidency, the Congress and let us not forget the Supreme Court. A lot of donors are licking their chops at the prospect of a Republican-dominated Government, and they will give big money to try to attain it."
Mr. Makinson also said that he thought there would be "an explosion" in independent expenditures on such things as issue advocacy advertisements. In 1996, the Annenberg Public Policy Center estimated that $45 million to $60 million was spent on issue advocacy advertisements. In February, John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O, declared that the labor federation would spend as much as $46 million in 1999 and 2000 on grass-roots lobbying and campaigning. Mr. Sweeney emphasized that the money would be used for political literature, phone banks to get out the vote, issue advertisements and voter registration.
In 1995, the unions spent $35 million on such activities, although the Republican leaders dispute that figure. Republicans estimated that organized labor spent as much as $500 million on the 1996 elections.
The Republican Congressional leadership, meanwhile, is also helping to raise millions of dollars for issue advertising to counter the union effort.
Mr. Wertheimer said that he estimated that at least $200 million would be spent this year and next year on such issue advertisements.
On Capitol Hill, fund-raisers said that they were astonished by the rate of contributions pouring in for House and Senate incumbents.
A total of 73 Senate candidates have raised $50 million in the first six months of 1999, according to election commission figures.
That amount is more than seven times the $7 million that 50 candidates raised through the first half of 1993, the last election cycle for the current group of 33 Senate seats that are now up for grabs.
Mr. Makinson predicted that the Presidential race might very well be "locked up" by October 2000, but that the fight for control of the House would produce enormous last-minute contributions.
"Let's not forget the impact of the wide-open race for control of the House of Representatives," he said. "When we're a month out, the House race will be the most important race to be decided, and it will attract a lot of last-minute money."
More than $60 million of soft money was raised in the first half of this year, a 75 percent increase over the first half of 1995.
Campaign finance experts predicted that the parties would raise at least $500 million in soft money by November 2000. But they cautioned that the figure could be significantly higher, especially after more contributions solicited by Mr. Bush's "Pioneers" fund-raising club of 150 people are counted.
By June 1999, the Pioneers had contributed $3 million of soft money, but campaign finance experts predict that they will raise huge sums for the Republican Party later this year. "They will be going gangbusters for the unlimited soft money contributions," Mr. Makinson said.

HEADLINE: Government Moves to Protect Alaskans' Subsistence Fishing

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Federal authorities took back a treasured prize of Alaska's statehood on Friday, seizing partial control of the state's rich fisheries to protect the rights of rural Alaskans who depend on fish for food.
Federal law requires the subsistence fishing priority for rural residents, including Eskimos, Indians and other native people, freeing them from many regulations that govern sport hunting and fishing. Opponents contend that this discriminates against urban residents who also rely on fish and game. 
 The Federal takeover came after eight Republican state senators blocked an effort to send voters an amendment to the state Constitution that would allow the rural subsistence fishing priority.
The subsistence priority applies to about 20 percent of Alaskans, or about 120,000 rural residents. Slightly less than half are Native Alaskans -- Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts.
The rule allows them to catch more fish and use more efficient fishing methods. It also allows protection of subsistence users by restricting the amount of wildlife taken by other hunters and fishermen.
The immediate impact of the takeover will likely be negligible because the summer fishing season is nearly over. But the impact is expected to grow over time.
The Federal managers could begin restricting commercial fishing as early as next year to allow more salmon to reach remote villagers.
The return of Federal fish managers is a bitter pill for many who recall disastrous Federal practices that depleted salmon runs before Alaska became a state in 1959. The Federal government's cozy relationship with big fish canneries was such a sore subject that more people voted to abolish the commercial fish trap than for ratification of the state's constitution.
"We could have prevented the offensive intrusion of Federal management of Alaska's fish and game resources, a right that really was at the root of statehood," said Gov. Tony Knowles, who called the Legislature into special session in a last-ditch effort to amend the constitution. "We could also have at the very same time protected the vital importance of subsistence to the economy, to the culture, to the way of life in rural Alaska."
The conflict between state and Federal law dates back to 1980, when Congress included the rural priority in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Nine years later, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that it violated the state constitution's guarantee of equal access to fish and game. Federal managers took over subsistence hunting on Federal land the next year.
A 1994 court decision expanded Federal authority to lakes, rivers and streams within or alongside that land. Intervention by the state's powerful Congressional delegation fended off the takeover until this year.

HEADLINE: Nation's Arbitrators Begin New Term

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Opening its new term on Monday, the Supreme Court returns from a three-month recess to a docket that places the Justices squarely in the midst of some of the country's most passionate debates, from health care to campaign finance to Government aid to religious schools.
In addition, the Court will continue its re-examination of the boundary between Federal authority and state sovereignty, taking up new cases that move the federalism battleground into the arena of civil rights legislation, where the stakes are higher than ever. 
 The Justices accepted 15 new cases in the last three weeks, bringing the total to 44 and filling their argument calendar through January. Cases to be heard in the late winter and spring, perhaps several dozen more, will be added over the next few months to complete the 1999-2000 term.
Important cases scheduled for the term's opening days suggest the range of what awaits the Justices. On Monday, they will hear arguments on whether a 1996 law, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, left any meaningful role for the Federal courts in reviewing state prisoners' convictions and sentences. On Tuesday, the Court will hear Missouri's defense of its $1,075 contribution limit for statewide political campaigns, in a case with clear implications for the similar limits under Federal election law.
On Wednesday, the Court will take up a constitutional challenge to a provision of Hawaii law that limits to descendants of the native Hawaiians the right to vote in certain elections. Transcending its exotic locale, this dispute could be a vehicle for a broader ruling about using race as a basis for government benefits.
It is not known how early in the term Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be able to return to work, after her surgery for colon cancer on Sept. 17. After her doctors found no sign that a small tumor had spread, she was discharged from a hospital here this week with an excellent prognosis.
If Justice Ginsburg cannot participate in the early arguments, she has the option of listening to the tapes and voting in the cases.
As part of the opening day, the Court will also announce the disposition of more than 1,700 appeals that have accumulated during the recess, nearly all of which the Justices will turn down without further review.
These are the highlights of the new term so far:
 
Federalism
In a series of decisions over the last four years, the Court has invoked several constitutional doctrines to curb the authority of Congress to impose requirements on state governments or to make the states answerable for their behavior as defendants in private lawsuits in either Federal or state court. Most of these cases were decided by 5-to-4 majorities, and federalism remains the current Court's most contentious issue.
The four federalism cases on the docket for the new term may well fan the flames even higher, because these cases have broad implications for the ability of Congress to enact civil rights legislation. The question in United States v. Morrison, No. 99-5, is whether Congress had the authority to pass the Violence Against Women Act, a 1994 law that permitted victims of rape and other crimes "motivated by gender" to sue their attackers in Federal court. A Federal appeals court ruled that the law was not a valid exercise of the power of Congress either to regulate interstate commerce or to enforce the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment.
In Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, No. 98-791, the Court will decide whether employees of state agencies can sue states for age discrimination under a Federal law, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The Justices' answer may determine whether other antidiscrimination laws, including such measures as the Americans With Disabilities Act, can be applied to the states.
The Court will decide in Reno v. Condon, No. 98-1464, whether state motor vehicle agencies can be bound by a Federal law that prohibits the commercial sale of drivers' personal information, which many states have found to be a profitable commodity.
And in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States, No. 98-1828, the question is whether states are constitutionally immune from lawsuits brought by private whistle-blowers under the Federal False Claims Act.
 
Free Speech
The Court has six First Amendment cases on the docket, an unusually high number that may reflect the unsettled nature of many free speech questions. For example, the lower Federal courts appear to be uncertain about the continuing validity of aspects of the Supreme Court's 1976 ruling in Buckley v. Valeo, which established the current constitutional framework for campaign finance.
The Federal appeals court in St. Louis struck down Missouri's $1,075 limit on contributions, close to the $1,000 limit the Court upheld in the Buckley case, on the ground that inflation since 1976 has whittled the value of $1,000 to under $400. That amount is too restrictive of the right of a citizen to "speak" by means of political contributions, the appeals court said in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963. Though the Supreme Court does not appear to have much appetite for reopening the campaign finance issue itself, even a narrowly based upholding of the Missouri decision could have that effect by presumptively invalidating the Federal limits.
In a case involving the privacy of government records, the Court will decide the constitutionality of a California law that makes arrest records available for journalistic and some other purposes, but not for commercial use, such as for sale to lawyers and insurance companies. In Los Angeles Police Department v. United Reporting Publishing Corporation, No. 98-678, the department is appealing a Federal appeals court's ruling that the restriction on commercial access violates the First Amendment.
Another First Amendment dispute involves student activity fees at public universities. The Federal appeals court in Chicago, viewing the fee at the University of Wisconsin as equivalent to compelled speech, ruled that students who objected to particular student organizations that received a share of the money had a constitutional right not to contribute. In Board of Regents v. Southworth, No. 98-1189, the university is arguing that the fee simply establishes a public forum in which all viewpoints are represented.
Two cases concern sexually explicit speech or expression. In one, Erie, Pa. v. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161, the Court will revisit, for the first time in eight years, the government's ability to regulate nude dancing. The question in United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, is the validity of a Federal law requiring providers of sexually explicit cable television programming to scramble the signal or limit the hours so that nonsubscribing homes cannot receive the programming inadvertently when children are watching.
In Hill v. Colorado, No. 98-1856, the Court will consider, for the third time in recent years, the validity of restrictions on protests outside abortion clinics.
 
Religion
A program under which local school districts use Federal money to provide computers and other equipment to private schools, including religious schools, within their boundaries was declared unconstitutional by a Federal appeals court. The Clinton Administration is supporting the appeal in Mitchell v. Helms, No. 98-1648, a case that may indicate how receptive the Justices will be in cases not yet before the Court to arguments for publicly financed vouchers for parochial school tuition.
 
Equal Protection
Under the Hawaii Constitution, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs decides how millions of dollars are to be spent on behalf of the state's native Hawaiian people, and only people of Hawaiian ancestry may vote for its trustees. The lower Federal courts have rejected a Hawaii-born white man's challenge to this restriction as an illegitimate racial qualification on voting. Defending its system in Rice v. Cayetano, No. 98-818, Hawaii is arguing that the restriction is based on Hawaii's special history and not on race as such.
 
Federal Law
Several cases have important implications for Federal regulatory programs and policies. In Food and Drug Administration v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco, No. 98-1152, the Court will decide whether the Government has authority under current law to regulate tobacco as a drug, a proposition that was rejected by a Federal appeals court.
In Pegram v. Herdrich, No. 98-1152, the Justices will decide whether people who receive medical care as a benefit of employment can sue health maintenance organizations for putting cost-containment goals above their duty to act in the best interest of individual patients.
The question in Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, No. 98-822, is whether a defendant in a suit brought by private citizens under the Clean Water Act can escape liability for civil penalties if it stops polluting while the lawsuit is in progress.
 
Criminal Law
In Illinois v. Wardlow, No. 98-1036, the Court will decide whether someone's unprovoked flight at the sight of a police officer is such inherently suspicious behavior as to justify the officer in pursuing and stopping the person and conducting a pat-down search.
The question in Williams v. Taylor, No. 98-8384, is what degree of deference the Federal courts owe to state-court determinations in reviewing a state prisoner's constitutional challenge to a conviction or sentence. The Court will be interpreting the central portions of the 1996 law by which Congress sharply restricted the jurisdiction of Federal judges to issue writs of habeas corpus; the question is, how sharply.
 
Grandparents' Rights
In a case from the state of Washington, the Court will rule on the constitutionality of state laws that give grandparents, and other relatives and "third parties," the right to seek court-ordered visitation over the objection of children's parents. The Washington Supreme Court struck the law down as violating the fundamental right of parents to decide how to raise their children.
While this case, Troxel v. Granville, No. 99-138, will give high visibility to the question of grandparents' rights, it also raises the deeper question, under the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process, of how courts should identify and analyze fundamental rights.

HEADLINE: M.T.A.'s Capital Plan Goes Beyond Second Ave. Subway

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The plan for a new Second Avenue subway got most of the attention, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's $17.5 billion, five-year capital plan includes a host of other improvements stretching across the New York region.
The plan, adopted on Thursday by the authority's board, would provide the first major investment in decades -- $3 billion -- in new tunnels, tracks and trains that would expand the region's subway and commuter rail network. 
 And while the plan immediately provoked protest over the $700 million that would be provided for the Second Avenue subway, an amount many riders and Manhattan officials say is too little, the ensuing debate may have diverted attention from the plan's breadth. It calls for large investments in subway platforms and train stations, and would lay the groundwork for the construction of other new lines far afield from Second Avenue.
"We want to do things that would improve the economy as well as improving the ride for our customers," Christopher P. Boylan, the M.T.A.'s deputy executive director, said on Thursday as he described what may have been one of the plan's biggest surprises -- $20 million for a new Metro-North station at Yankee Stadium.
That station would only be built "once lease discussion between the City of New York and the Yankees is complete," according to the plan.
Another project is a new tunnel extending the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to the far West Side, providing access to what some Manhattan officials envision as an expanded Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. If such an expansion takes place, "we stand ready to move," said E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman.
The No. 7 subway project is presented as one of the most tentative on the authority's wish list, with money provided only for preliminary engineering and environmental studies. The plan allocates $75 million for it and two other long-range expansion projects: one would reconfigure tracks to give Metro-North trains access to Penn Station, the other would provide new express service by subway or Metro-North from Grand Central Terminal to lower Manhattan.
"If the Second Avenue subway isn't getting built until 2015, I wouldn't expect these others until 2050," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' advocacy group.
Another major subway construction project was given higher priority, and more financial backing, than many transit experts outside the M.T.A. had expected. That is the plan to provide direct subway access to La Guardia Airport, probably through an extension of the N line in Queens.
The plan provides $645 million for the project, including $500 million widely believed to have been added at the insistence of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, both of whom have advocated the La Guardia subway link. It stipulates that the new line would be completed, at least to the boundary of La Guardia, by 2004. Connecting the line to airport terminals would take longer.
"Obviously the Mayor and Borough President have been pushing, but nobody is quite sure what the project will be," said Jeff Zupan, a transportation analyst for the Regional Plan Association, a nongovernmental planning group. There are several open questions, including whether to build a new underground branch of the N train or an elevated line through densely populated sections of Queens, where residents have already voiced opposition to an elevated structure.
With such a broad assortment of projects, the M.T.A. for now faces its biggest test in Albany, where proponents of a larger Second Avenue subway project have a powerful ally in Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the Assembly, who represents the Lower East Side of Manhattan. As one of four members of an oversight committee with veto power over the capital plan, Mr. Silver has promised to block any version that does not provide far more money for a Second Avenue project.
Mr. Silver, reflecting criticisms by many on the East Side, said last week that a Second Avenue subway from the Bronx to the Battery was needed to relieve crowding on the Lexington Avenue line, something that would grow worse because of the largest project provided for in the M.T.A. plan. That project, budgeted at $1.6 billion, would provide access to Grand Central Terminal by the Long Island Rail Road, in turn drawing new riders to the Lexington Avenue line.
The plan includes several other projects that seemed likely last week to survive any compromise forged in Albany.
The largest are improvements to existing rail and subway stations, including a $225 million renovation of the Jamaica Station, which serves the subway and the L.I.R.R. That project, to be completed by 2004, has been designed to upgrade the station as a transfer point serving the new shuttle trains to Kennedy International Airport that are planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Another project, budgeted at $75 million, would be at the Atlantic Avenue station in Brooklyn, another hub for subway lines and the L.I.R.R. Throughout the subway system, the plan calls for improvements ranging from new elevators and platforms to cosmetic repairs at 64 stations in all five boroughs.
The plan also provides $140 million to maintain and expand fare collection systems of New York City buses and subways, in which the Metrocard has overtaken tokens as the preferred method of payment. While upgrading the electronics of the Metrocard system, Mr. Boylan said the authority will explore other technologies like a "Smart Card" that could be used like the "E-Z Pass" at highway toll booths, enabling customers to charge their fares to a credit card account.

Strong Economy Lifts Poor

 BODY:
Rising incomes lifted 1.1 Americans above the official poverty threshold ($16,665 for a four-person household) last year. But the nation's strong economy didn't help narrow the income gap between rich and poor Americans. The gap didn't widen, but a high-end household making $130,000 still earned eight times more than a family at the poverty line, which is the same ratio that's existed since 1993.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Lingering Racial Inequalities

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Race continues to play a significant role in the success of Americans, from jobs to education to housing, according to a study conducted in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit and Los Angeles.
The five-year survey, the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, which was released on Friday, found that racial stereotypes and attitudes heavily influenced the job market, with blacks at the bottom. 
 The study, sponsored by the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City and the Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy at Harvard University, looked at 9,000 households and 3,500 employers in the four cities. The project tried to understand the patterns of racial inequality and how they have been affected by economic changes.
While the study found that minorities are doing better financially in the 1990's, they are making less money and working fewer hours than their white counterparts. Blacks also had more difficulty finding jobs.

HEADLINE: Distant Rumbles of a Korean War Massacre

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "G.I.'s Tell of a U.S. Massacre in Korean War" (front page, Sept. 30):
I can understand, though not forgive, that military strategies and tactics can be flawed and that soldiers may act irrationally, resulting in innocent civilians becoming targets of merciless killing. 
 What really angers me is South Korea's reluctance and inaction regarding its people's claims. The Government has clearly forsaken the rights of its people in the name of economic, political and military allegiance to the United States. And while it is important for South Korea to maintain a good relationship with the only remaining superpower, at what price? If the South Korean Government is not willing to stand up for the injustice inflicted upon its people, who will?

HEADLINE: NONPROFIT GROUPS ACCUSED OF BILKING LUNCH PROGRAMS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Officers of many nonprofit organizations have illegally enriched themselves by pocketing millions of dollars of Federal money that was meant to feed poor children in day care homes, Federal investigators and state officials say.
The inspector general of the Agriculture Department, Roger C. Viadero, said the nonprofit organizations had routinely filed false claims overstating the number of meals served at the homes, which are recruited and supervised by the nonprofit groups. Some of these groups, he said, claimed Federal money for meals served to "nonexistent children" in fictitious day care homes, while others extorted money by demanding kickbacks from legitimate day care providers. 
 "This type of fraud takes food out of the mouths of children," Mr. Viadero said, summarizing what his agents had found in more than 3,200 unannounced visits to private day care homes and child care centers that receive Federal money.
The Federal Government spends $1.7 billion a year to provide meals for 2.4 million children in day care.
Mr. Viadero began a nationwide investigation of the program after a whistle-blower complained about problems at a nonprofit organization in California.
Mr. Viadero's office issued a comprehensive audit last month laying out the abuses, which he said were attributable in part to basic flaws in the program's structure that Federal officials had not moved fast enough to correct.
The nonprofit groups, known as sponsors, play a critical role as middlemen between the Government and day care homes and centers. The sponsors are supposed to monitor the day care homes. They review and pay claims for meals served. And they are supposed to insure that the meals meet Federal nutrition standards.
So far the Federal Government has filed criminal charges against 44 people, asserting that they defrauded the program, known formally as the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Twenty-eight of them have been convicted or pleaded guilty; the other cases are still open.
Child care advocates see the Federal program as a guarantor of quality care. But Mr. Viadero said children were often short-changed.
In his audit report, Mr. Viadero, a former New York City police officer who worked for 15 years at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said: "Day care providers and their sponsors were found to be submitting false claims on a grand scale. Some were engaging in money laundering, embezzlement, forgery and extortion. Many simply padded their payrolls to justify fatter Government checks."
Katherine J. O'Neill, a dietitian at B. J. Enterprises in Scottsdale, Ariz., a sponsor for 380 day care homes, said the Federal investigators had focused too much on paperwork and bookkeeping errors.
"Children can be happy even if day care providers don't do all their paperwork on time," said Ms. O'Neill, whose company was criticized for such errors. "Kids are eating better because of this program. Instead of a bologna sandwich and Kool-Aid, they have a turkey sandwich, lettuce, fruit and milk for lunch."
The need for day care has grown in recent years because a booming economy has drawn more parents into the labor force and millions of women are trying to comply with work requirements of new Federal and state welfare laws.
On the average, each sponsor supervises 150 day care homes, but some are responsible for more than 1,500. State licensing rules vary, but typically a home may have up to six children. Most of the children are under the age of 5, but some may be as old as 12. Day care homes receive more Federal money if they are in low-income neighborhoods or serve children from low-income families.
The audit cited many improprieties. In California, the husband-and-wife owners of Pacific Asian American Family Care pleaded guilty to defrauding the Government and were ordered to pay $2.2 million in restitution. Prosecutors said the owners had submitted claims for inflated budgets, which included payments to nonexistent employees and bogus business entities.
The Government said the defendants, Kyung Ho Moon and Wan Hee Moon, used Federal money to buy four houses and to pay college expenses for their children. Mrs. Moon worked simultaneously for the State of California, monitoring the work of child care sponsors, including her own company.
In another case, Federal prosecutors said a Salt Lake City couple had misappropriated Federal money "designated solely for the reimbursement of meals previously eaten by underprivileged children." The indictment says the couple, William and Magda Evans, demanded kickbacks from legitimate day care providers and claimed Federal payments for day care homes that did not exist or had been excluded from the program. A trial is scheduled for Nov. 15.
In Toledo, Ohio, the New Jerusalem Church of God in Christ claimed Federal reimbursement for meals served in day care homes that did not exist. The homes listed vacant lots and abandoned houses as their addresses. Seven people have pleaded guilty and been ordered to pay restitution totaling more than $1.3 million.
In his recent report, the inspector general said, "We found sponsors operating as nonprofit organizations, but enriching themselves at the expense of the children to whom they were supposed to provide meals."
In some places, Mr. Viadero said, sponsors have retained 15 percent to 30 percent of the food money intended for child care centers. "This is one of the most significant causes of fraud and mismanagement" in the program, he said.
Sponsors defend the practice by saying they need the money to cover their administrative costs. But the inspector general said he could find "no correlation" between the sponsors' actual costs and the amounts they kept for themselves.
The inspector general said that many sponsors "honestly did not understand" the child care food program, and that Federal officials "could have prevented or detected much of the fraudulent activity" if they had been more vigilant. Officials of the Food and Nutrition Service, a unit of the Agriculture Department, have often failed to act on warnings from the inspector general for four years, Mr. Viadero said.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said he was working with the inspector general to root out fraud in the child care food program. Samuel Chambers Jr., administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, said the agency would propose stricter rules for the program later this year. But Mr. Viadero said, "We do not believe that the corrective actions proposed to date go far enough."
Several state officials said that local sponsors had shared information about how to run scams without being detected. But Federal officials said they did not see evidence of a multistate conspiracy.
The inspector general found that sponsors were reluctant to enforce Federal requirements because they receive more Federal money as they sign up and supervise more day care homes.
In effect, he said, sponsors compete against one another, and homes tend to prefer the more lenient sponsors.
Mr. Viadero said this was "a basic flaw in the design" of the program.
State officials, while acknowledging some responsibility, said the Federal Government had also been at fault.
Harley R. Fancher, administrator of special nutrition programs in the Arkansas Department of Human Services, said, "The basic problem is that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has been in the business of shoveling out money with little or no accountability."
Mr. Fancher, who worked for the Federal Food and Nutrition Service for 20 years, said: "In some cases, a sponsor signs up a bunch of day care providers by mail and never visits the homes. The providers are not trained in meal preparation or record-keeping."
The Federal Government has a list of nonprofit organizations cited for serious deficiencies and tries to keep them out of the program. But Mr. Fancher said a company excluded in one state might try to reinvent itself and enter the program in another state.
"For example," he said, "if XYZ Inc. does something wrong in North Carolina, it may come back as the ZYX Corporation in Arkansas or Oklahoma."
Robert C. Kenny, a spokesman for the New York State Health Department, said that the Federal Government was conducting two investigations of the child care food program in New York, but that no one had been accused of wrongdoing to date. The New York program receives $120 million a year in Federal money to feed 55,100 children in family day care homes and 242,000 youngsters in child care centers.
The inspector general's report cited many examples of problems in the food program, including these:
*Fifty-three day care providers in Decatur, Ala. -- more than 40 percent of those reviewed -- claimed reimbursement for meals served to children on days when the homes were closed or the children were absent.
*In Pennsylvania, an officer of a nonprofit organization, CT Child Nutrition Services, pleaded guilty to embezzling $92,000 of Federal money. She used the money "to cover personal expenses, such as her mortgage, and to buy equipment for a restaurant she owned."
*A former member of the Detroit school board was convicted of fraudulently obtaining $15.5 million in Federal food money. She overstated the number of meals served at 16 day care centers. In addition, the office manager of a nonprofit organization in Phoenix, Feeding Arizona Kids, pleaded guilty to theft of Government money after investigators found that she had written 60 checks to people whom she falsely identified as day care providers. She deposited the checks in her personal account.

HEADLINE: Akio Morita, Key to Japan's Rise As Co-Founder of Sony, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Akio Morita, the co-founder of the Sony Corporation who personified Japan's rise from postwar rubble to industrial riches and became the unofficial ambassador of its business community to the world, died today in Tokyo. He was 78.
He died of pneumonia, the company said. He had been in failing health since a stroke in 1993. 
 More than anyone else, it was Mr. Morita and his Sony colleagues who changed the world's image of the term "Made in Japan" from one of paper parasols and shoddy imitations to one of high technology and high reliability in miniature packages.
Founded in a bombed-out Tokyo department store after World War II, Sony became indisputably one of the world's most innovative companies, famous for products like the pocket-sized transistor radio, the videocassette recorder, the Walkman and the compact disk.
And Mr. Morita, whose contribution was greater in marketing than in technology, made the Sony brand into one of the best known and respected in the world. A Harris poll last year showed Sony as the No. 1 brand name among American consumers, ahead of American companies like General Electric and Coca-Cola.
A tireless traveler who moved his family to New York in 1963 for a year to learn American ways, Mr. Morita also spearheaded the internationalization of Japanese business. Sony was the first Japanese company to sell its stock on the New York Stock Exchange, in 1970, one of the first to build a factory in the United States, in 1972, and still one of the only ones to have even a couple of Westerners on its board.
Sony also became a major force in the American entertainment business, acquiring CBS Records in 1988 and Columbia Pictures, the Hollywood studio, in 1989. The latter purchase, however, turned into an embarrassing debacle as Sony suffered big losses in Hollywood.
In the process, Mr. Morita, with his white mane and quick tongue, became the unofficial representative of Japan's business community, generally working to smooth trade relations between his country and the United States, but sometimes stirring resentment in both countries with his pointed criticisms.
"He was truly a statesman par excellence in a business sense," said Mike Mansfield, the former Senator and United States Ambassador to Japan. "Internationally, he did more for Japan in a business sense than anyone else in Japan."
To the day of his death, nearly six years after the stroke that removed him from an active role in business, he was still no doubt Japan's most famous business executive, and the only one many Americans could name or recognize in a photograph. Time magazine selected him in December as one of 20 "most influential business geniuses" of the 20th century, the only non-American chosen.
In his own country, where executives tend to be self-effacing, Mr. Morita was viewed as a bit flamboyant and arrogant. He was the first to fly around in a corporate business jet and helicopter. He appeared in a television commercial for the American Express card. He served on the boards of three foreign companies. He took up sports like skiing, scuba diving and wind surfing in his sixties. He cavorted with the rock star Cyndi Lauper after Sony bought CBS Records.
Shortly before he suffered his stroke, Mr. Morita made waves in his home country by saying that Japan was like a "fortress" and that its unique business practices were alienating its trading partners. "Although there is much to commend in Japan's economic system, it is simply too far out of sync with the West on certain essential points," he wrote in The Atlantic Monthly in June 1993.
He advocated shorter working hours, more dividends for stockholders of Japanese companies and a sharp cutback in government regulation. Now, as Japan struggles through an economic slump that has lasted most of the decade, some of what Mr. Morita advocated is being adopted.
"Japan was coming closer to him and seeing the need for that kind of leadership," said Yoshihiro Tsurumi, professor of international business at the Baruch Graduate School of Business at the City University of New York.
 
Never Comfortable In West's Business World
In his book "Sony: The Private Life" (Houghton Mifflin, 1999), John Nathan suggests that Mr. Morita, a Japanese traditionalist at home, was never really comfortable in the Western business world, despite the many American business executives and politicians he entertained and counted as friends.
Mr. Nathan, a Japanese translator and University of California professor of Japanese culture who was granted free access to Sony executives, quotes Mr. Morita's eldest son, Hideo, as saying of his father, "He had to 'act' -- I'm sorry to use that word but I can't help it -- he had to act as the most international-understanding businessman in Japan." But Hideo adds, "It was never real."
And Sony's current president, Nobuyuki Idei, is quoted as saying, "Japanese of the generation before mine had an inferiority complex about foreigners. Akio Morita himself was a living inferiority complex."
Despite being virtually synonymous with Sony, especially outside Japan, Mr. Morita did not actually become the company's president until 1971 and its chairman and chief executive until 1976. Before that he was the junior partner to Masaru Ibuka, an engineering genius who, while not as widely known in the West, is considered in Japan to be the main founder of Sony. Mr. Ibuka died in December 1997 at the age of 89.
Akio Morita was born on Jan. 26, 1921, into a wealthy family in Nagoya, an industrial city in central Japan. As the eldest son, he was groomed from elementary school age to succeed his father as president of the sake brewery that had been in the family for 14 generations.
But in junior high school, Akio became fascinated by his family's phonograph, a rare appliance in Japan at that time. He became an avid electronics hobbyist, building his own crude phonograph and radio receiver. He studied physics at Osaka Imperial University as World War II was starting. Mr. Morita enlisted in the navy under a program that would allow him to do research instead of serving in combat.
It was while developing heat-seeking weapons that Mr. Morita first worked with Mr. Ibuka, 13 years his senior, who before the war had started an electronic instrument company.
After the war, Mr. Ibuka set up a new company in a bombed-out department store in Tokyo, making kits that converted AM radios into short-wave receivers. Mr. Morita happened to read a newspaper article about it and contacted his old friend. The next year, when Mr. Ibuka wanted to incorporate the company, he asked Mr. Morita to join.
Mr. Morita, Mr. Ibuka and another executive traveled to the Nagoya area to implore Mr. Morita's father to release his son from the family business. The elder Mr. Morita not only agreed, he also later became a financial backer of the new company, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, or Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, which was inaugurated on May 7, 1946, with an investment of about $500.
 
Looking at a Transistor, Seeing More Than Others
The company produced Japan's first reel-to-reel magnetic tape recorder. A few years later it licensed the rights to the transistor from Bell Laboratories, after overcoming resistance from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Officials at Bell Labs warned that the only consumer use would be for hearing aids.
But Sony then produced Japan's first transistor radio in 1955. (An American company, Regency, produced the world's first a few months earlier but didn't succeed in selling it.) In 1957, Sony came out with what it termed a pocket-sized transistor radio. But the radio was actually a bit too big for most pockets, so Mr. Morita had Sony salesmen wear special shirts with extra-large pockets.
There followed the Trinitron television in 1968; the first successful home VCR, the Betamax, in 1975; the Walkman personal stereo in 1979; and the compact disk, developed with Philips N.V. of the Netherlands, in 1982.
Not all products were successful. Sony has stumbled several times trying to sell personal computers. And in 1981, Mr. Morita announced the Mavica, a digital camera that recorded pictures on a floppy disk instead of on film. But the camera never made it to market and critics accused Mr. Morita of making a premature announcement to burnish Sony's image as an innovator.
Mr. Morita did not believe in market research. "Our plan is to lead the public with new products rather than ask them what kind of products they want," he said in his autobiography, "Made in Japan," (E.P. Dutton, 1986), written with the journalists Edwin M. Reingold and Mitsuko Shimomura. "The public does not know what is possible, but we do."
Mr. Morita prided himself in particular on the Walkman, the portable stereo cassette player with headphones. Actually, according to the official corporate history, it was Mr. Ibuka who came up with the idea. But Mr. Morita pressed hard for the project, overcoming resistance within Sony to a tape player that, in its early versions, could not record. Mr. Morita, despite initial reservations about the product's name, eventually ordered all Sony subsidiaries around the world to call it the Walkman.
From the start of the company, however, Mr. Morita was much more involved in marketing, while Mr. Ibuka handled technology development. And from the start, he had an international orientation, traveling to New York and Europe in the 1950's to sell the company wares.
Such international focus was needed because as a new company, Sony had some trouble breaking into its home market, where more established manufacturers had close relationships with retailers. Indeed, Japan's other big postwar success, the Honda Motor Company, also succeeded first in the United States and to this day sells more cars in America than in Japan.
Mr. Morita soon realized that the company needed a name that foreigners could pronounce and remember. So in 1958 the company name was changed to Sony, derived from the Latin word sonus, meaning sound, and from the American vernacular "sonny boy," which Mr. Morita hoped would purvey a young image.
One of Mr. Morita's cardinal tenets was to foster and protect the company's brand name. Early on, Bulova, the watch company, said it would order 100,000 radios but would sell them under its own name. Mr. Morita turned down the huge order. His colleagues back in Tokyo thought he was crazy. But, Mr. Morita wrote in his autobiography, "I said then and I have said it often since: It was the best decision I ever made."
 
Betamax: Another First And a Bad Decision
Mr. Morita's worst decision might have been with the Betamax, the first successful consumer VCR, which came out in 1975. Sony did not readily license its technology to other electronics companies. So most of its Japanese rivals banded together behind the VHS system, which offered longer recording time. Eventually, the Betamax was run out of the market.
Sony evolved into a company that, by Japanese standards at least, was very Westernized, though in many ways it was traditionally Japanese. All company employees, from the president on down, wear company jackets, a common practice in Japan. But at Sony the uniforms were styled by the designer Issey Miyake.
Mr. Morita first criticized some of his country's business practices in 1966, when he wrote a book, published in Japanese, with a title that might loosely translate as "An Essay on the Useless School Career." He criticized Japanese companies for hiring and promoting people based only on what college they had attended. Sony even stopped asking applicants the name of their college, and it was one of the first Japanese companies to base salaries partly on merit instead of solely on seniority.
Perhaps because of Sony's dependence on exports, Mr. Morita tried to reduce trade tensions with the United States. In the late 1960's, Sony forged a temporary joint venture with Texas Instruments, then the world's leading semiconductor company, allowing it to set up operations in Japan.
In 1972, Mr. Morita set up a subsidiary to export American products, like Regal cookware and Whirlpool refrigerators, to Japan.
"Selling pans and cookware and refrigerators was not our bag, but Akio believed in doing something for the U.S.-Japan relationship," said Sadami (Chris) Wada, who ran that effort and then handled government relations for the Sony Corporation of America for many years. The operation was abandoned some years later as unsuccessful.
In 1988, Mr. Morita founded the Council for Better Corporate Citizenship, made up of Japanese companies. At a time when Japanese politicians were angering African-Americans with insensitive remarks, one of the council's first projects was to make thousands of copies of an abridged version of "Eyes on the Prize," the American television documentary about the struggle of blacks for equal rights, and distribute it to high schools in Japan.
Mr. Morita was not averse to using his influence among American politicians and business executives to lobby for Sony. He barnstormed the United States in 1984, meeting with governors and with President Reagan, threatening to build Sony factories only in states that did not have the "unitary tax," a tax on a multinational corporation's global earnings, not just those in the state. Eventually California and other states scrapped the tax.
But while Mr. Morita was often perceived as a friend of the United States, he was often critical of it and proud of being Japanese, flying his country's flag over Sony's New York showroom when it opened in 1962. He often told a story of how ashamed he was on his first trip to Germany in 1953. At a restaurant he ordered ice cream, and it came with a small paper parasol stuck in it. "This is from your country," the waiter said.
In the 1980's, when Japan seemed on top of the world, Mr. Morita was among the most vocal of the Japanese executives in criticizing American business and hailing the success of the Japanese model.
He said American managers were financial paper shufflers who "can see only 10 minutes ahead" and were not interested in building for the long term. And he said that American companies were losing interest in manufacturing, that the United States was "abandoning its status as an industrial power." Those factors, he said, and not trade barriers, were the reasons for America's trade deficit with Japan.
"There are few things in the United States that Japanese want to buy, but there are a lot of things in Japan that Americans want to buy," he wrote in 1989. "This is at the root of the trade imbalance. The problem arises in that American politicians fail to understand this simple fact."
In 1989, Mr. Morita was the co-author, along with a nationalist politician, Shintaro Ishihara, of "The Japan That Can Say No," a book that urged Japan to stand up to American trade demands, which it said were motivated partly by racism. The book also said Japan had the power to change the world balance of power by selling its advanced computer chips to the Soviet Union instead of the United States.
Even though those strident remarks were generally in the chapters Mr. Ishihara wrote, the book created a stir when an unauthorized translation made its way around Washington. Mr. Morita frantically back-pedaled, saying the book had not been intended for an American audience. And he refused to authorize an English translation.
It was later that year that Sony paid $3.4 billion to buy Columbia Pictures, a purchase driven largely by Mr. Morita, who thought that if Sony had owned a studio issuing movies in the Beta format, it would not have lost the VCR wars.
Although Sony prided itself on being more Americanized than its Japanese rivals, the purchase became a lightning rod for American concern about a wave of Japanese acquisitions of American companies and real estate. "Japan Invades Hollywood" read the cover of Newsweek. In Japan as well, Sony came in for criticism for stirring up anti-Japanese feeling in the United States.
Mr. Morita had a simple answer. "If you don't want Japan to buy it, don't sell it," he told a New York Times reporter shortly after the purchase. Nevertheless, sensitive to concerns, he promised that the studio would be run by Americans and would be free even to make a movie critical of Japan's Emperor.
Worse than misjudging the political reaction, however, the seemingly sophisticated Sony proved to be a babe in the woods in Hollywood.
Sony is generally considered to have paid too much for the studio, and it paid several hundred million dollars more to hire managers away from Warner Brothers, provoking a costly fight with that studio. And those managers, in turn, spent money extravagantly and produced a string of box office bombs. Mr. Morita and his successor as Sony chief executive, Norio Ohga, perhaps because they were worried about stirring up anti-Japanese sentiment, exercised little oversight.
 
$3.2 Billion Lost In Hollywood Venture
In late 1994, in one of the most embarrassing moments in its history, Sony announced that it would suffer a loss of $3.2 billion from its investment in Hollywood. But it has stuck with the studio, now called Sony Pictures Entertainment, and appears to be turning it around.
The Morita name will live on at Sony because many members of Mr. Morita's family are involved in the company.
Besides his wife, Mr. Morita is survived by his eldest son, Hideo, who now runs the sake brewery and other family businesses; a younger son, Masao, an executive with Sony Music Entertainment in Japan; and a daughter, Naoko Okada, who also lives in Japan. He is also survived by his brother Kazuaki, who volunteered to take over the family sake brewery in Mr. Morita's stead; another brother, Masaaki, a long-time Sony executive, and a sister, Kikuko Iwama, who was married to the late Kazuo Iwama, a former president of Sony.
In the 1990's corporate Japan, worried about escalating trade tensions, turned to Mr. Morita, whom it once considered an arrogant maverick, to be its official leader. Mr. Morita was expected to become chairman of Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business lobbying organization, a post that had always gone to the head of a company in an old-line heavy industry like steel.
But on Nov. 30, 1993, while playing his usual 7 A.M. Tuesday tennis game, Mr. Morita suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. A year later, just days after Sony announced its huge Hollywood loss, Mr. Morita, confined to a wheelchair, attended a Sony board meeting in Tokyo and resigned as chairman.
He had spent much of his time since then undergoing rehabilitation at his beachfront home near Diamond Head on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. At first Mr. Morita was able to speak a little, shake hands and hit back tennis balls spit out by a machine, said Mr. Wada, the retired Sony government relations manager.
But more recently, Mr. Wada said, Mr. Morita had lost the ability to speak and communicated mainly through eye contact with his wife, Yoshiko. The couple's Christmas greeting card last year had a message from Mrs. Morita saying that her husband rose at 6 A.M., retired at 9 P.M. and spent much of the day in rehabilitation. "He may be overeating," she said, mentioning his fondness for eel.
At first Mr. Morita returned to Japan periodically, but that stopped a couple of years ago when friends and family worried that the flights were further damaging his health. Mr. Morita did not attend the 1997 funeral of Mr. Ibuka.
But Sony officials still visited him in Hawaii to keep him up to date on the business and show him new products. In January 1998, some 200 executives, friends and dignitaries went to Hawaii to attend a party for Mr. Morita's 77th birthday, considered a lucky age in Japan.

HEADLINE: A Sound Sleep

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FRIED 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN

 BODY:
It's 4:30 A.M. Do you know where your drummer is?
If you're a rock band working at Water Music Recorders here, "he's probably upstairs," said the studio's owner and manager, Rob Grenoble, and that much more likely to be available for the recording session in the morning. 
 "No more waiting for Louie," said Mr. Grenoble, a wiry man with a quick, hoarse voice, for whom the studio is a life's work, and a home.
Water Music is the New York area's only residential recording studio, complete with furnished apartments. And it is the apartments and the state-of-the art recording gear that have lured bands from all over the world and created an atmosphere light years from the music-industry boardrooms just across the Hudson.
On a typical night recently, John Agnello, a record producer, was wolfing down Chinese food while he watched the MTV Music Awards. A. J. Cope, a singer and songwriter staying in an apartment on weekdays to work on new material, lay on a nearby couch, strumming her guitar. Dave Smalley, a rock singer, songwriter and guitarist up from Virginia to work on an album, sat on the floor of the studio control room drawing pigs and butterflies with Mr. Grenoble's 2-year-old daughter, Song. In the loft upstairs, Those Bastard Souls, an acoustic rock band whose members have convened from Memphis, Chicago and Brooklyn, took a break from pre-tour rehearsals while their lead singer cooked up a batch of spaghetti sauce.
Built in an abandoned feather and down factory with money lent by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, the six-year-old studio retains the look of its industrial Hoboken neighborhood. Its walls are not lined with gold records. But its client list includes nationally known names like Ben Folds Five, Pavement, John Popper of Blues Traveler, Government Mule and dozens of independent music heroes.
For engineers, the lure is the 48-track single-frame Neve mixing console, with full computer automation -- the Dom Perignon of recording equipment -- and a 2,080-square-foot room. Mike Barbiero, a producer and mixer of Counting Crows and Guns 'n' Roses fame, fell in love with the room in 1998. He said, "It's not a posh location, but it's a very flexible room sound, a vast space that can be manipulated in many ways."
For the record labels writing the checks, Water Music offers top-of-the-line equipment near New York, but "away from the high price of New York hotels," Mr. Barbiero says.
For musicians like David Strouse of Memphis, who has the look of a rock-and-roll professor with his wire-rim glasses and dress slacks and shoes, it's the "easygoing, down-home feeling." As he stirred his sauce, he talked about the stresses of making a record and finding a place for his band members, spread out across the country, to meet. Looking around at the art hanging on the white walls, he said, "It's nicer than most of the places I've lived."
It's also a place of creativity. Ms. Cope works on songs with Mr. Agnello and Mr. Grenoble in their spare hours. John Popper spent several weeks in residence this year writing the material for the album he later recorded in the studio downstairs.
Finally, it's a place for barbecues. Mr. Agnello described the scene when a young band he was working with in the small studio, known as the Inferno, met the punk legends the Misfits, working in the the Big Room in May. Someone had the idea of a Memorial Day barbecue in the garden outside the studio door, and both bands partook. That broke the ice. "For a week it was just a bunch of people hanging out," Mr. Agnello said. "Two of our guys were singing background vocals for the Misfits, and they were doing hand claps on our record. Their producer would say, 'Hey, come on in, what do you think of this?' "
The idea of a musical community was part of the original concept for Mr. Grenoble, who came to Hoboken nearly 20 years ago from farming country in upstate New York with his own band, Cries. He and his bandmates found themselves in the studio business when local musicians wanted to use the recording gear Cries had set up in its rehearsal studio.
Darting around the 15,000-square-foot complex with his classically gaunt rock-and-roll face and his dark, multi-directional hair, the 47-year-old producer, writer, manager, engineer and on-site father explained that he wanted to create a place that would combine the fun he had playing in a band with a successful business model.
"I've been an artist my whole life," Mr. Grenoble said. "It's fun being a biz guy."
One of the reasons for the studio's success is that "Rob is such a personality himself," said James Mastro, a Hoboken musician, producer and music store owner. "He's been incredibly helpful to local bands."
Another reason is simply convenience. Mr. Agnello persuaded by a Swiss band, Favez, to come to his part of the world by pointing it to the Water Music Web site (www.watermusicrecorders.com). Chris Wicky, the Favez singer and guitarist, saw the names of bands he admired, as well as a chance to see New York at a price they could afford. "It's really fun, and it's really practical," Mr. Wicky said. Of his accommodations here, he said, "You feel like you're living at a friend's house."
Mr. Agnello lives in Manhattan but often stays at the studio anyway. "I wake up at a quarter to 11, walk into the shower, and I'm ready to work at 11." But beyond convenience, "when everyone's relaxed, the results come easier and better," he said. "And the barbecue is so cool. It's so American, and you're in an environment that's so not that."
American or not, it's an environment in which Mr. Grenoble has chosen to rear his daughter. He lives with Song and her mother, Kathy Griffin, on the premises, which are still under construction. The evening playtime for the baby (full name: Song River Jones Griffin Grenoble) includes singing Beatles songs with her dad, and then trotting off to the studio control room, which offers what her mother describes as "the best busy box in the world, especially the harmonizer."
The studio is something of a first child for Mr. Grenoble and Ms. Griffin, who managed Cries in its early days in the 1980's. She shared the work and finances as Mr. Grenoble bought out his bandmates and gradually moved into the current address from 1989 to 1991; the studio opened as a business in June 1993. Soon after, Ms. Griffin left the band and took a day job as a comptroller for her uncle's air-conditioning business.
Mr. Grenoble says they can separate their private lives from the studio simply by shutting the door. "Being the boss" and having a staff of three helps, he says. Equally crucial is the studio design. The floating foundation -- the floor sits on spongy plastic supports, which muffle vibrations -- allows for almost complete soundproofing.
Running a rock-and-roll hotel has its drawbacks. Mr. Grenoble mentions a Canadian band that destroyed the hardwood floor in the loft apartment by playing hockey. As for running a recording studio, he compares it to running a brothel: "You deal with whoever comes in the door."
Increasingly, the studio's international reputation (he lists Japan, Spain, South Africa, Australia, Croatia, Norway, Cuba and England as countries that have sent bands there) has enabled the studio to bring in the original, independent music Mr. Grenoble prefers. Enjoying his most successful year yet made it easy to turn down a recent offer from a condo-minded real estate agent to buy the property for five times what Mr. Grenoble originally paid for it.
And his daughter usually visits about once an hour. "We always bust up a session to say good night," he said.
Mike Barbiero, who works at the studio in part because it helps keep him close to his own children in Alpine, adds, "And it keeps the language in line a little bit."

HEADLINE: Last Innings at a Can-Do Cathedral

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
On the night 35 years ago before the Astrodome was unveiled to the world, Tal Smith walked onto the field and stared at the lights twinkling beneath the great curved roof of steel and glass. He stood inside the huge air conditioned bowl, surrounded by nearly 50,000 empty seats, and beheld the artificial wonder of it all.
Never mind that the Astrodome would later be compared to the "working end of a gigantic roll-on deodorant." Never mind that baseball purists would later blame the Dome for many of the modern ills of the game. In an opening night exhibition with the Yankees on April 9, 1965, President Lyndon Baines Johnson watched Mickey Mantle hit the first home run, and the nation, like Mr. Smith, a Houston Astros executive, seemed astonished at the world's first indoor coliseum. 
 "This was truly a revolutionary venture," said Mr. Smith, now the president of the Astros. "It wasn't just a new ball park. There were people who would line up to tour the building even without an event. They would marvel at it."
Once promoted as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the Astrodome is now a relic, as outdated as a polyester leisure suit. On Sunday, the Astros will play their last regular season game at the Astrodome before moving next season to a new, state-of-the-art downtown ball park. Mammoth enough to contain an 18-story building, the Dome was a monument to the Texan appetite for big things and an emblem of a colorful era when men like the stadium's eccentric creator, Judge Roy Hofheinz, reshaped Houston and Texas through will and money.
Now, the Astrodome will stand all but abandoned, a monstrous, climate-controlled white elephant that has succumbed not only to the changing economics of sports but to the changing expectations of what a building must do to hold our attention. Along with the NASA Space Center, the Astrodome transformed Houston in the 1960's from a big city backwater; the Dome became the world's biggest stage. When Bobby Riggs challenged Billie Jean King to the "Battle of the Sexes" in tennis, in 1973, only the sheer mass of the Astrodome could do justice to the comic magnitude of the event.
"There's a little bit of a sense of loss as we abandon this thing we were so proud of," said Stephen Klineberg, a sociologist at the University of Houston. "It was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to Houston."
The new stadium, the $250 million Enron Field, says as much about Houston today as the Astrodome did a generation ago. Fashioned with a retractable roof, it has real grass, and it joins many new ball parks in evoking baseball's past. Named for a gas company, Enron Field bespeaks a more generic, corporate face of Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city. If the Astrodome attracted world attention (and a sniff of scorn), Enron Field's ambitions seem more prosaic: It will make a lot of money for the Astros, provide a more intimate setting for baseball and, city officials hope, spur redevelopment of the east side of downtown.
"In the sports industry," Mr. Smith conceded, "the economics dictate. Buildings become obsolete because they can't generate the same revenues as in other facilities." He added, "It's regrettable, but it has been 35 years. It had a great run."
The Astrodome will not be demolished, the fate reserved next year for one of its imitators, the Kingdome in Seattle. But its future is muddled at best. The Astrodome has only one big tenant left, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which is held each February. But even the rodeo has hinted that it, too, might leave if Houston attracts a new professional football team and with it, a new football stadium.
The same Astrodome where Elvis sang and Billy Graham preached could wind up as a bloated hall for trade shows. "I don't think that any Hofheinz ever stood in the way of progress in the name of nostalgia," reflected Fred Hofheinz, a two-term mayor in the 1970's who was his father's chief aide during the construction of the Astrodome. But, he added, "I do want to see it survive."
With its serrated skyline and knot of interstate highways, Houston today is a vast sprawl that seems far removed from the city that Judge Roy Hofheinz dominated in the 1950's and 1960's. A cocksure impresario who fancied cigars and any other totem of opulence, Judge Hofheinz was reputed to sleep only when bored: He was a lawyer at 19, a state legislator at 22, the Harris County judge at 24, a millionaire in business by his 30's, and at 40 elected mayor.
By the 1960's, the judge, as he was always known, took control of Houston's efforts to attract a major league baseball team. He was fascinated by the notion of building a cooled, domed shopping mall and surmised that air conditioning could be the salvation for baseball in heat-choked Houston as well. It was a toss-up as to which local endeavor was considered more incredible: NASA's efforts to put a man on the moon or Judge Hofheinz's plan to build a coliseum where men would play baseball indoors.
He did it. The city was granted an expansion team, the Colt 45's, and the judge, adopting the futuristic glint of the space program, renamed the team the Astros (the other choice was Stars). Members of the grounds crew wore orange space suits. A scoreboard flashing electronic lights (and advertising) dominated the outfield. A buzzing capacity crowd watched the Astros beat the Yankees 2-1 in extra innings as a 6,600 ton air-conditioning system chilled the arena to 72 degrees.
"Nobody can ever see this," the judge had said the day before the game, "and go back to Kalamazoo, Chicago, New York, you name it, and still think this town is bush league, that this town is Indian territory."
The spectacle of the Astrodome, the judge realized, was part of the sell. He built his own five-story apartment/playhouse above right field, complete with a two-story Presidential Suite, a Circus Room, a Medieval chapel, a barber shop and a bowling alley. He built smaller suites, the forebears of today's luxury suites, for rental to corporations or wealthy individuals. On opening night, Fred Hofheinz fetched bowl after bowl of chocolate ice cream for President Johnson, a Texan, as he admired the Presidential Suite.
"He was the quintessential salesman," Mr. Hofheinz said of his father. The Astrodome "was made up like Disneyland in order to make it something people talked about."
Baseball traditionalists would come to despise the Astrodome and the artifice it brought to the game. The field itself, initially made of grass and later sawdust, eventually was replaced by a carpet patented as Astroturf. To the judge, the turf was one of the Dome's many wonders; his ground crew jauntily vacuumed it in their space suits. But artificial turf was derided as a hazard to players and a blaspheme against the pastoral history of the game.
Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who teaches at Rice University and the University of Houston, said the Astrodome was an "immensely important" building in the mid-20th century, if mostly as triumph of engineering rather than architecture. "It is one of the great monuments of American hubris in the 1960's in this kind of sense of no limits," he said, adding graciously, "It is not a tremendously refined work of architecture."
But Mr. Fox noted that the Dome played an unexpected role in the evolution of Houston. When construction costs ran over budget, the judge and city officials called a second bond referendum. With opposition growing, the judge lobbied the city's growing, if largely disenfranchised, block of black voters, promising that blacks could attend all events at the Dome and also could work there.
"It played a key role in the desegregation of public facilities in Houston," Mr. Fox said.
Today, with the city's population divided fairly equally among blacks, whites and Latinos, Houston has a black mayor, Lee Brown. Mr. Klineberg, the sociologist, noted that as Houston has matured, the business and political climate dominated by Judge Hofheinz and a small number of other white leaders has changed markedly. "This is a radically different kind of economy and a new kind of business leadership and a multicultural environment," he said.
Charles Savino, an executive with the Greater Houston Partnership, said that the judge's can-do spirit lived on in local leaders like Bob McNair, who is trying to lure a new professional football team and build a new stadium. But, Mr. Savino said, Houston is a different place now.
"We're kind of becoming more like the rest of the country," Mr. Savino said, which might make an apt epitaph for the Astrodome. Over the years similar stadiums, some larger, were built in other cities. The awe and wonder wore off: In 1966, more than 550,000 people paid to tour the Astrodome. By 1998, the number had fallen to 112,000.
The judge lived in the Dome for five years after his first wife died, but he suffered a stroke, moved out and eventually relinquished control of the team. He died in 1982.
On Sunday, after the Astros and the Dodgers finish the game, a ceremony is planned to honor the judge's stadium. The Astros might make the playoffs, meaning at least one more game, but Sunday is being treated as the farewell. Older players will congregate, and Willie Nelson will sing "Turn Out the Lights." Fred Hofheinz will stand on the field he helped build and say goodbye as a living link to his father. "He was very proud of that building," he said. "It was the pinnacle of his life."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: In the Clutch;
That Team Didn't Choke; It Just Stinks

BYLINE: By ALLEN BARRA

 BODY:
CLUTCH and choke -- as sporting terms, they came from auto racing and spread to other sports. Hemingway, writing about Joe DiMaggio, defined "clutch" performance for all time: "Grace under pressure." "Choke" has never needed a Hemingway to define it.
Both words are much on the minds of New York baseball fans after the New York Mets' pennant and playoff hopes took a dramatic dashing at the hands of the Atlanta Braves in successive weeks. For the most part, Mets fans hold one of two opinions. 
 One faction, much the larger, holds that the Mets' losses to the National League East-leading Braves (not to mention to the lowly Phillies) were classic "choke." The other, more philosophical, faction holds that, after all, few really expected the Mets to have 92 victories at that point in the season, and why call it a choke when the team with the best record in baseball, the Braves, wins a handful of tough, closely contested games? Isn't that what the best team is supposed to do? The Mets didn't choke; the Braves were just the better team. No one has asked the Mets themselves, but they'd probably prefer the second argument.
Generally speaking, athletes tend to believe in clutch performance while denying the existence of choke. Every professional athlete is happy to talk about his favorite big-play performance, but nobody ever wants to single out the chokers. Interviewing the former Yankee pitcher Jim Bouton a few years ago, I was curious to see if he thought Ralph Branca choked when he gave up that famous home run to Bobby Thompson in the 1951 playoffs. "Why would you call that a choke?" Bouton replied. "Branca thought he made a great pitch. Didn't anyone ever hit a good pitch for a home run?"
I once asked Bubba Smith, the former Baltimore Colts defensive lineman, if his team choked in the most famous of all Super Bowl upsets, the 16-7 loss to the Joe Namath-led New York Jets in 1969. "Hell, no," the 290-pound Smith shot back at me. "We didn't choke. We went right there and put our game plan into effect." Then, I timidly inquired, why did the 22-point-favorite Colts get stomped? "Because," he said, "our game plan stunk."
Trying to pin down just what is a clutch or choke performance, then, is like trying to find evidence for the existence of the Loch Ness monster: Lots of people swear they have seen it, but no one has been able to capture it. George Ignatin, an economics professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham and a longtime sports statistician, is adamant. "Clutch and choke performance in baseball are illusions," he said. "Someone has to win, someone has to lose, and if you get a large enough sampling to make a valid study, you'll find that what a player does in so-called pressure situations is usually what he has done for his entire career."
Then why is the impression that a player has choked or come through in the clutch so strong? "Because of the drama," says Ignatin. "We remember the big game in September or the hit in the ninth inning, but we forget that the games in May or the hits in the third inning are every bit as important when it comes to winning games. We want heroes, so we make a hero out of John Elway for leading fourth-quarter comebacks without noticing the guy who didn't have to come back in the fourth quarter because he was so great in the first and second quarters.
"We like to say 'He came through in the end with the game on the line,' but we forget that the game is always on the line."
But if choking is an illusion in team sports, what about one-on-one games like tennis, or even a sport involving solitary performance like golf? Many tennis fans regard Jana Novotna's Wimbledon flops in 1993 and 1997 as the biggest chokes in modern time, but Allen St. John, who covered the match for Inside Sports, insists: "She was playing over her head, and when she realized it she came down to earth, hard. Or, to say it another way, what should have been happening from the beginning suddenly happened at the end."
In modern golf, no one has more of a crash-and-burn image than Greg Norman, but Chris Hodenfield, the editor of Golf & Travel magazine, thinks Norman's penchant for choking is overstated. "If you check, you find a lot of great players who have had similar folds," he said. "In the 1930's, Craig Wood, like Norman, lost playoffs in all four major tournaments. Probably no one has more of a reputation as a clutch performer than Arnold Palmer, but he lost three playoffs in the U.S. Open."
Hodenfield calls Palmer's loss of a seven-stroke lead to a charging Billy Casper in the '66 United States Open to be one of the biggest collapses he's seen by a major player and notes: "Funny how no one ever called Arnie a choker. But Norman will probably never shake that image now, no matter how well he plays."
So, it would seem that all the evidence indicates that clutch performance and choking are mostly illusion. The logical part of the brain may accept that, but the fan in us wants to believe that our heroes either come through in the clutch or choke with the game on the line. They say there are no atheists in foxholes, and there are no philosophers in the ninth inning of a close game.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
An Energetic Irish Troupe That Keeps on the Move

BYLINE: By KAREN FRICKER; Karen Fricker is an American theater critic living in Dublin.

DATELINE: DUBLIN

 BODY:
THE major artistic challenge facing theater in Ireland today may be what to do about all those plays. The nation's illustrious history of dramatic writing hangs over contemporary Irish theater like a combined blessing and curse; modern companies either seem to be searching for the next Synge or O'Casey (or McDonagh) or trying to steer the theater away from the almighty word altogether.
One recent production here suggests, however, that a middle ground might be possible. New Yorkers will be able to see it when "The Whiteheaded Boy," a 1916 Irish classic, opens at the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday. Presented by Barabbas, an innovative Dublin theater company, it is part of the Next Wave Festival at BAM and the fifth of six stops on the company's first American tour. After next Sunday's performance, the production moves to Chicago. 
 Barabbas . . . the Company, its formal title, is one of several theater groups founded in Ireland in the early 1990's that emphasize physical movement over traditional text-focused presentation. Among their forerunners is the Theatre de Complicite in England, founded in the 1980's and influenced by Jacques Lecoq, the French movement artist who taught numerous mimes. The three members of Barabbas are Veronica Coburn, 33, Raymond Keane, 42, and Mikel Murfi, 34, who named the group not after the biblical character but one in a nonsense story he used to tell his nieces and nephews. The three performers have trained in various forms of physical theater and share an interest in clowning. Mr. Murfi studied for three years at the Lecoq school in Paris. Barabbas soon became a favorite with the critics for their collaboratively devised productions performed in an energetic style. But by 1997 they realized they needed some fresh inspiration.
"We were a little devised-out, to be honest," Ms. Coburn said, "and we were thinking it was time to come back to text. So we and our friend Gerry Stembridge started to think about doing an Irish classic in the style of the company -- or rather about how the style of the company might accommodate a classic work."
Beyond the need for new creative energy, Barabbas was also interested in broadening its audience. "We always felt that what we were doing could be quite popular," Mr. Keane said, "but our work tended to appeal more to the adventurous theatergoer. This was a way to bring what we did more into reach for everyone."
The play they chose was itself ripe for renewal. Lennox Robinson's "Whiteheaded Boy" was hugely popular in its day. From its premiere at the Abbey Theater in 1916 through 1965 it enjoyed more performances than Synge's "Playboy of the Western World," but it subsequently fell out of fashion.
A textbook example of a well-made play (in which every scene advances a tightly wound plot), it tells the story of a propriety-obsessed family thrown into disarray when the coddled youngest son, Denis, drops out of Trinity College. The play's title, which refers to that character, is an Irish expression comparable to the term fair-haired boy. Though the satire is gentle, Robinson's disdain for middle-class pretensions comes through clearly in the eventual victory of straight forward youth over moralizing elders.
The unconventional approach to the material by Barabbas, with Mr. Stembridge as director, is clear even before the performance starts: the three company members, wearing matching gray waiterlike costumes, wander around the stage, chatting among themselves and casually acknowledging the audience. They portray 11 of the 12 roles, indicating character changes only by switches in physicality and vocal quality. They also alternate in speaking Robinson's opinionated stage directions ("He's kissed her, glory be to God!").
Just when the audience has settled into this stylized mode of performance, the action is subverted by the entrance of the final character, a fourth actor (Louis Lovett) dressed in period garb and performing in a more subtle style than the others, who are very obviously surprised by the new arrival.
"We've established ourselves as storytellers, but the new performer is from the old play, from the world of the theater," Mr. Keane said. "Through our performance style, we're saying, 'Here's a great play that we're going to act out for you now.' But then someone appears who is a real actor. That clash of theater traditions is one of the things the production is about."
Ms. Coburn elaborated: "If you look at it in black and white, the outsider is old Ireland and we are new Ireland. But part of the point is that nothing much has changed. All the things that Robinson is sending up are still around to some extent. The warmth we try to create between the audience and performer is related to the warmth we feel when we see something we are all familiar with; it's a kind of complicity. It's like we're all putting our hands up and saying we know these people; we are these people."
The Barabbas "Whiteheaded Boy" has had considerable popular appeal. It was revived three times in successively larger Dublin theaters, and has toured throughout Ireland and to England and Wales. "We've reached a broad number of people, particularly outside of Dublin," said Mr. Murfi, "who know our name now and might take a chance on another one of our shows."
The next project will be a collaboration with the Abbey involving 15 female actors and one male actor (Mr. Keane), co-directed by Ms. Coburn and Mr. Murfi. Entitled "Brilliant Days Blue," it is a new piece about love and weather and will rely much more on movement and the dynamic between actors than on text. But the company is insistent that their current foray into classic text was necessary, culturally as well as artistically.
"Some people say Irish theater never seems to be getting over its usual preoccupations -- the kitchen sink, the family, the rural conditions," Ms. Coburn said. "But even in this booming economy we have now, there still seems to be a need to trawl through this stuff. Perhaps we have to talk about it as a country, as a nationality, before we can move on."

TO BELIEVE IN WOMEN
 What Lesbians Have Done for America --
 A History.
 By Lillian Faderman.
 Illustrated. 434 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $30. 
 THE United States military may have developed stealth bombers, but gay men and lesbians, long habituated to the dangers and pleasures of invisibility, have been using "gaydar" for decades. This highly developed extrasensory perception can detect our kind in virtually any social situation, and no heterosexual romance -- on screen or off -- can mask the fragrant scent of a fellow traveler. O.K., we do make mistakes occasionally, but our skills are less in demand now that the rich and famous have taken to outing themselves. Not to be limited by star worship, we have recently extended our devotion to Ellen DeGeneres's mother, Cher's daughter and even Newt Gingrich's half sister.
Thrusting aside a recent issue of the gay magazine The Advocate, which promised the dubious delight of unveiling Jerry Falwell's homosexual cousin, I turned hopefully to "To Believe in Women." Lillian Faderman is no amateur at outing the dead, whether famous or virtually unknown. Faderman, a professor of English and lesbian studies at California State University, Fresno, is the author of "Surpassing the Love of Men" and "Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers," two important books in which she detailed female romantic friendship from the 16th century to the present. Her scholarship has introduced many grateful readers to lesbian history and cultural practices.
In "To Believe in Women," she uses a thematic framework. Starting with the suffrage movement, Faderman traces the contributions of women-identified-women to a number of important social movements and professions in the United States, including abolition, settlement houses, unionizing efforts, education and medicine. She balances the very famous, like Susan B. Anthony and Jane Addams, with the lesser-known, like three pioneering physicians, Marie Zakrzewska, Mary Walker and Emily Blackwell. Faderman sees history as a tool "for presenting role models to the young, giving people reasons for pride in the identities they have chosen, teaching lessons about the past that we may be able to incorporate in the present."
Moving beyond her own definition of lesbianism in "Surpassing the Love of Men" -- a romantic commitment to another woman -- Faderman expands the term in her new book to encompass all "intense woman-to-woman relating and commitment." For some, her tendentious claims are a welcome corrective to biographies that erased lesbian existence. However, three decades of diligent recovery efforts by historians and biographers like Blanche Wiesen Cook, Carroll Smith-Rosenberg, Leila J. Rupp and Jonathan Ned Katz have already mined the sexual histories of many of the figures Faderman writes about, including Addams, the founder of Hull House, and M. Carey Thomas, the former president of Bryn Mawr.
Faderman's generous definition of lesbianism permits her to claim for our side many women who shared living arrangements with other women. After installing suffrage leaders Susan B. Anthony and Carrie Chapman Catt (who was twice married to men) in the Lesbian Hall of Fame, Faderman then argues for a lesbian influence in a number of other important social spheres, from settlement-house work to women's education and the professions. Almost all female social reformers, one might conclude, were lesbians, and the goings-on in Hull House were remarkably akin to those in Radclyffe Hall's house.
Few would dispute Faderman's observation that heterosexual marriage historically tended to burden women with the responsibility of bearing children and overseeing household chores. But sexual orientation was probably less of a factor for these reformers than the financial wherewithal that freed them from the tedious demands of earning a living. Most eschewed motherhood as well. Many pioneering women were indeed single or lived with female companions, but others found supportive male partners. A few feigned illness or embraced antisocial behaviors to liberate themselves from their families' marital expectations.
Without a doubt, there were singular qualities of "intense woman-to-woman" relationships that gave some women the strength to devote themselves to social causes and career advancement. However, Faderman fails to investigate adequately the daily dynamics that allowed one or both partners to engage in successful social activism or economic reform. Moreover, while she underscores the fact that same-sex pairs were treated with the respect generally reserved for heterosexual couples, it is never clear how far knowledge of their intimate arrangements traveled outside their own circles, or whether most of these women would have considered themselves lesbians. Since some of the women Faderman writes about, like Frieda Miller, the former director of the Women's Bureau in the Department of Labor, died as recently as 1973, it would be telling to explore why lesbian denial was generally a factor in these relationships.
Faderman suggests that "heterosexual professional couples might do well to ponder the domestic arrangements of the lesbian pioneers." Yet while both halves of Faderman's couples were often devoted to a cause, one woman generally took responsibility for running the household or was wealthy enough to have servants. Though a few of the women Faderman discusses, like Frieda Miller, raised children, most sacrificed childbearing to careers and causes. Today, when both heterosexual and homosexual couples struggle to balance the demands of work and home, Faderman may inadvertently be broadcasting a discouraging message about the prospects for combining family life with a profession or social activism.
Rather than going forward with some clear analytical framework, Faderman is frequently sidetracked by the gossipy contents of amorous letters, even though the passions of many of these women, including the relationship between Mary Woolley, president of Mount Holyoke College, and her partner, Jeannette Marks, have already been milked elsewhere.
For those who need a dose of pride and a slice of history, Faderman's portraits should strike a popular note. "To Believe in Women" is a decent starting point for learning about these pioneers and their contributions to American life. It sure beats reading about some important person's cousin twice removed while waiting for the next closet door to come crashing open.

HEADLINE: Demanding the Right Size Government

BYLINE: By Alan Ehrenhalt; Alan Ehrenhalt is the executive editor of Governing magazine and the author, most recently, of "The Lost City."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Something odd is happening to government at the end of the 20th century: It is flying apart and coming together, all at the same time.
On the one hand, the 1990's have been a decade of secession and dreams of secession, just about everywhere in the world. The decade began with the defiance of the old Soviet republics and is ending with a reborn Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh and a vote for independence in East Timor. For a host of reasons -- ethnic, ideological and economic -- whole chunks of countries are struggling to escape the confines of the larger political entities to which they have been confined. 
 No one should confuse Staten Island with East Timor, but it is fair to say that secessionist impulses have been loose in American politics as well. Just about every big city in America has an enclave or a neighborhood that sees the larger government as oppressive and unresponsive, and wants to break away. Most have not carried through, but the impact is always felt. Los Angeles politics has been driven for nearly five years by the guerrillas of the San Fernando Valley, demanding their freedom. The Valley may not get its wish, but it has forced a new charter and new political rules on the entire city.
Wherever you look, big governments are under pressure to break up. But here is the remarkable thing: If you look closely enough, you will see powerful forces at work in the opposite direction as well. Something is fusing governments back together.
You probably have not heard of the Alpine Diamond. I hadn't until a few months ago. It is a fledgling regional government across three national borders, in the little alcove of Europe where France, Italy and Switzerland all come together. It is essentially a re-creation of the medieval kingdom of Savoy, without the monarch. It exists because the two million people who live in this region decided that none of their existing governments -- national, provincial or local -- were capable of managing the region's economic development.
The Alpine Diamond would be easy to dismiss as boutique regionalism, if it weren't so suggestive of events taking place in the United States. Earlier this year, driven to drastic steps by worsening pollution and traffic congestion, Georgia created a powerful new superagency to take control of transportation and land-use decisions in the entire Atlanta metropolitan region. The myriad small communities around Pittsburgh, notoriously quarrelsome and turf-conscious, are gradually knitting themselves together into an umbrella government. In both places, the impulse to action was the same: Public issues are not respecting traditional boundaries. Something larger is needed to handle them.
Public entities almost everywhere in the developed world are in a state of unusual ferment and rearrangement. People have discovered that the governmental units created long ago are too clumsy to serve them very well. This theme is playing itself out right now at all levels of government, from city hall to national capital. It is happening, perhaps more clearly than anywhere, in Congress.
Even a casual observer can tell that Congress did very little in the last couple of years, but this obscures a much larger point: Congress has done relatively little of importance in the last 10 years.
Bluntly put, it has ceased to be the primary political instrument for resolving the difficulties of modern American capitalism. Congress missed its chances to write national rules for regulating health care and to deregulate electricity. Its most important decision of recent years -- the 1996 welfare reform law -- was merely a decision to turn the problem over to the states.
Gradually, without most of us stopping to notice it, Congress is ceasing to be a serious legislative institution. It is becoming a medium of entertainment. Its members continue to make speeches, hold hearings and shout at each other for political profit -- but as current budget wrangle shows, they have difficulty even with the routine business required to keep the government running. To the extent that useful legislative work is being done in America right now, it is being done somewhere further down the chain.
Some of this change can be traced to incompetent leadership; a good deal relates to the partisan division of power between Congress and the WhiteHouse that has been the status quo for most of the previous two decades. But at some point one cannot escape the idea that larger forces are playing themselves out.
A decade ago the sociologist Daniel Bell predicted that in the 21st century most of the important political issues wouldn't be national any more. They would be either global or local. To be dealt with effectively, they would have to migrate up or down, to a level that could handle them. It was a remarkable prophecy, and as the century ends, it is coming true. Problems are migrating up and down all over government, in search of the appropriate place for solution.
In some cases they are reaching the very bottom. One of the least understood and most interesting political phenomena of the 1990's has been the rise of micro-governments -- small institutional entities that have sprung up to deal with practical issues at the level of the neighborhood, the subdivision and even the individual block. This has been happening all over America; it has been happening in western Europe as well.
In Amsterdam, Copenhagen and in many areas of Germany, municipal governments have been ceding authority to small-scale elected traffic control boards, called woonerven, that have expanded their reach into land-use and planning issues. The 2,500 communes of France, tiny vestiges of medieval life that can have fewer than 1,000 residents, have been revitalized by new grants of law enforcement authority that include, in some situations, the power to make arrests.
Micro-government has taken a different form in this country, but it has been equally potent. It includes business improvement districts, like the ones in Manhattan, which begin by cleaning streets and grow into crucial players in local politics; it includes the homeowners' associations that govern life in thousands of new subdivisions for tens of millions of Americans.
Citizens are essentially looking for two forms of public authority: intimate ones in their community that can deal with their needs in a humane way, and regional ones big enough to impose some order and stability on economic life. The governments they have are mostly too remote and bureaucratic for the first job and too small and weak for the second one. Hence the search for substitutes at both ends.
Of course, there are some major obstacles in the way. They are the existing governmental institutions at all levels with a vested interest in their own survival. The city and county of Los Angeles are not going to disappear no matter how much evidence turns up that they are the wrong size for the job. Congress is not going to close down. The reshuffling of government will have be achieved by working around the old institutions, not by replacing them.
But little by little, it will take place. A couple of decades from now, governmental power in much of the world will be exercised quite differently than it is today. Some of it will migrate down -- from nations down to states and from cities and counties to communes, woonerven and homeowners associations. Some of it will migrate up -- to new regional creations like the Alpine Diamond.
There will still be city councils. There will still be a Congress. It will be up to them to find something useful to do with their time.

What's Wrong With the SAT and Its Elite Progeny

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

THE BIG TEST
The Secret History of the American Meritocracy
By Nicholas Lemann
406 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $27.
Nicholas Lemann's new book, "The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy," gets off to a bouncing start with its account of how Henry Chauncey, the ultimate WASP, fell in love with mental testing and dreamed of mounting a vast scientific project that would categorize, sort and route the entire population of the United States. 
 This was at Harvard in the 1930's, when James Bryant Conant was university president. When Mr. Chauncey graduated and became an assistant dean he found the perfect patron for his plan in Conant, who had his own idealistic dream. Conant wanted to replace the old hereditary elite that attended schools like Harvard and ran America with a new one based on intelligence and academic performance. The two men would collaborate by testing for Harvard's national scholarships.
The test they settled on was the Scholastic Aptitude Test. It was administered by the College Entrance Examination Board in Princeton, N.J., where Mr. Chauncey went to work in 1945 to build the Educational Testing Service into what Mr. Lemann calls "the Silicon Valley of its day."
All this is described in "The Big Test" in a lively narrative based on first-time access to the archives of the Educational Testing Service and promising implicitly that the secrets of those tests that loomed so large in our school years will be revealed.
But then something goes awry with Mr. Lemann's book, which succeeds his astute "Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How It Changed America" and his two earlier books, "Out of the 40's" and "The Fast Track." The prose of "The Big Test" seems to flatten out. The focus shifts to California, and the final chapters become a tediously detailed account of the battle in that state to overturn affirmative action in what eventually became the successful Proposition 209.
What does all this have to do with the SAT? Mr. Lemann's plan appears to have been to show how extremely naive Conant was to believe that his vision would, first, produce an improved university system, and, second, a superior form of elite, or one that, as Conant dreamed of it, was bound to represent the country's virtues and go on to become its civic leaders.
To illustrate the failure of Conant's vision, Mr. Lemann sets out to describe the modern university system and to show how the new elite produced by it was not only nonrepresentative but also tended to seek wealth and power instead of being public-spirited.
The task of making these points concrete leads Mr. Lemann to California, where the many threads of his story come together in a snarl. A hero of Conant's, Clark Kerr, builds the University of California to fill every need, be it social, political, intellectual and economic, and pronounces it a "multiversity." Mario Savio and the Free Speech Movement object to its repressive and exclusive ways, eventually costing President Kerr his job. To compensate for those left out by the SAT, affirmative-action programs are introduced, in reaction to which Proposition 209 is mounted. The final battle over this issue involves beneficiaries of both the SAT's and affirmative action.
This story might have been rich with dramatic irony, but it fails for several reasons. For one thing, Mr. Kerr's development of the University of California is a complex tale that doesn't forcefully illustrate what Mr. Lemann complains of as the growing selectivity of certain colleges. For another thing, the people through whose eyes he narrates his history are not clearly representative enough of the various points he is presumably making. The case of Molly Munger, a high-powered litigator who Mr. Lemann says was conscience-pricked to take up the black cause, is irritatingly beside the point since she devotes herself to good works only after making her fortune.
Finally, the climax of Mr. Lemann's story fails to compel because the issue of affirmative action around which it swirls is confusing in Mr. Lemann's handling.
Although he never does examine the makeup of the SAT (beyond offering a tiny and distorted sampling so difficult that one vocabulary question contains a word, "terile," that I couldn't find even in the O.E.D.), he does demonstrate its unfairness by showing how the difference between white and black performances on it depends not on intelligence but affluence, and by describing how a variation on it was designed at the Education Testing Service to compensate for such differences. (This was rejected, Mr. Lemann reports, because it was perceived by the E.T.S. as too great a threat to the newly established elite.)
But if the SAT's, while being unfair, do accurately predict academic performance, as Mr. Lemann admits, how should colleges accommodate those who perform less well on them and are admitted through affirmative action? By easing standards or by treating such students as special cases? Mr. Lemann doesn't explore such questions. He just assumes that his readers will share his outrage at the present system.
Then, as an afterthought, he describes what ought to take the place of the new "meritocracy," as the English writer Michael Young named it in his book "The Rise of the Meritocracy." Mr. Lemann writes, "We should adopt the goal of sending most people all the way though college, just as, a hundred years ago, we adopted the then much more distant goal of sending most people all the way through high school."
He continues: "To get more people through college, we shall have to establish greater national authority over education. High schools should prepare their students for college by teaching them a nationally agreed-upon curriculum. Tests for admission to college should be on mastery of this curriculum -- not the SAT or some dreamed-of better, fairer alternative test of innate abilities."
He concludes, "Test-prep should consist of mastering the high-school curriculum, not learning tricks to outwit multiple-choice aptitude exams."
Fine. But can we assume that under these ideal circumstances no new meritocracy would then develop, the present one being Mr. Lemann's real objection to the big-test system? Would no one ever again feel excluded or inferior? And, best of all, would no one ever again write books about the system's unfairness? As much as one might wish it to be the case, one kind of doubts it.

HEADLINE: MEDIA;
After a summer of high-profile coverage of Hispanic culture, some wonder if it will last.

BYLINE: By Mireya Navarro 

 BODY:
WHEN editors at New York magazine were planning their recent issue on Latinos, they searched for the magazine's last cover on the city's Hispanic population. They found one, about East Harlem, published in August 1972 under the headline, "The Big Mango: Latin Impact on New York Style."
"Learning that our last cover was more than 20 years ago was a little shocking to us," said John Homans, executive editor of New York magazine, which is owned by Primedia. 
 New York magazine's "The Latin Explosion" issue last month, for which the magazine even changed its logo to "Nueva York," was only one of several national magazine covers this summer that celebrated a Hispanic performer or examined the growing Hispanic influence. Some of the same articles also found their way into newspapers and television broadcasts, but the covers by mainstream magazines were striking because of their number and what many Latinos say was the scant attention devoted to them before by national publications.
There was Time magazine's "Latin Music Goes Pop" last May and Newsweek's "Latin U.S.A." last July. There was Salma Hayek on the cover of George (July), Jennifer Lopez on Elle (July) and Ricky Martin everywhere, including People (June), TV Guide (June), Playgirl (July) and Rolling Stone (August).
"It's nice to see that you've recognized what many of us have known for quite a while," one letter to the editor published in last week's issue of New York magazine said. "Your challenge is to continue this recognition in future issues."
But how much coverage of Latinos -- and what kind of coverage -- can be expected after this Latin summer? The coverage, many editors say, is not likely to fade away. With 31 million Haspanic people nationwide and growing, a critical mass has been building, both culturally and economically, that cannot be ignored, they said. Many point to Ricky Martin's show-stopping performance at the Grammys last February, and the ensuing Rickymania, as a watershed moment in drawing attention to that demographic force.
"We're trying to get out in front of that as the trend becomes clearer and clearer," said Kathleen Deveny, assistant managing editor at Newsweek, which is owned by the Washington Post Company. "It certainly is not our one effort in covering Latinos. Our coverage of race and ethnicity evolves."
Mr. Homans says the perception that there is little money to be made in the Hispanic market by English-language publications is gradually breaking down. The recent coverage, he said, "is driven by the fact that the Latino community is coming into its own economically."
Adam Moss, the editor of The New York Times Magazine, which ran an inside feature about the salsa singer Marc Anthony in August, said the recent burst of media coverage was more about a crossover market in entertainment than about Latinos. "I suspect that the explosion of coverage over the last several months had more to do with the fact that mainstream America now is starting to buy Latino music than it was about the growing Latino population," he said. "It's probable that people will cover more Latino issues related to demographic changes but I don't think that was what principally was driving the coverage. I think it was the mainstreaming of the music."
Some Hispanic people indeed bemoan that less sexy subjects and articles continue to be ignored. Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a New York Democrat of Puerto Rican background, says she finds the emphasis on pop culture by the media to be "sad."
"I love them," she said of the Hispanic performers, "and we can't reject what in a way helps us get on the radar screens of corporate America. But it shows the ignorance of the mainstream media about the contributions we've made in developing this country."
Groups like the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, have long argued that coverage is directly related to hiring. A survey of 165 top magazines by the trade magazine Mediaweek last year found that members of minorities accounted for 6.1 percent of the professional staff; 1.5 percent of them Hispanic.
One association official said such representation might help explain what she found to be a "gee-whiz, flavor of the month" quality of the recent cover articles. "Unless publications diversify staff they're going to cover Latinos as if they were some peculiar cultural phenomenon because they don't cover us on an ongoing basis as an actual community," said Rose Arce, a CNN producer and association board member. "They just went: 'Wow!, there are Latinos!' "
Janice C. Simpson, a senior editor at Time Warner's Time magazine who oversees arts and entertainment, said, "Right now, what the press is doing is chronicling this coming into its own of the Latino community."
She said articles are dictated by the news, including what she called Mr. Martin's breakthrough performance at the Grammys. But she said there was a need to integrate Hispanic people into overall coverage without focusing so much on ethnicity. "Down the line, I hope that when we're writing about Latino performers and writers, we're writing about them in the context of what they do," she said.
But some journalists remained skeptical. John Leland, the senior editor who co-wrote the articles for Newsweek in July, noted that recent coverage of the Puerto Rican nationalists who were granted clemency by President Clinton focused more on the dispute over Hillary Clinton's opposition to her husband's clemency offer than on the issue of Puerto Rico's independence or what the move meant to Puerto Ricans.
One angle largely left unexplored, Mr. Leland said, was brought up in a Sept. 10 column by Juan Gonzalez of The Daily News of New York. He wrote that "just as the O. J. Simpson criminal trial revealed the chasm between how blacks and whites regard our criminal justice system, the clemency furor has bared the radical differences between Puerto Ricans and the rest of America."
Mr. Leland added: "Are we going to cover a pop star like Ricky Martin and not cover a passionate interest of six-and-a-half million Puerto Ricans? The press had an opportunity there and did not do anything with it."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The On-Line Brokerage Battle

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
HEARD the pitch about dumping your full-service broker? Remember the ad about the stock-trading teen-ager with his own helicopter? Seen the television spot where the hunky stud muffin rubs the bunions of an older woman who is basking in her on-line investment wealth?
If there is one thing the Internet has brought to every American, it is a blitz of advertising from brokerage firms eager to lure do-it-yourself types on line. But that marketing flurry, it seems, was just the preview. The real advertising battle is just starting. 
 Over the next year, the top 10 on-line brokers have budgeted about $1.5 billion to fill airwaves, newspapers and magazines, billboards, other Web sites and E-mail in-boxes with advertising, all preaching some version of the mantra that you can get rich faster if you take charge of your own investments. To put that in perspective, Ford Motor spent the same amount of money hawking cars and trucks last year. And Walt Disney and Coca-Cola combined do not flog themselves nearly as hard.
The question is will all this marketing money pay off in the form of revenue-generating customers.
On-line companies are already well known for putting promotion before profit. But the latest spending spree ups the ante considerably. Several of the leading on-line brokerages, including Ameritrade, TD Waterhouse and National Discount Brokers, are set to triple their ad spending the next year to compete better with E*Trade, the advertising king of the on-line financial services industry, according to advertising industry experts and the companies themselves.
The on-line brokers are busily signing up celebrity representatives like the actress Geena Davis (TD Waterhouse), the self-parodying blond bombshell Anna Nichol Smith (E*Trade) and the teen-age Russian tennis star Anna Kournikova (Charles Schwab).
They have already reserved air time for the World Series and next winter's Superbowl. And the cost is mounting: E*Trade now spends about half of its revenue on marketing, analysts say, while other brokerages are pouring the bulk of proceeds raised from initial public offerings into splash campaigns. All of this spending raises questions about a business that, so far, has been one of E-commerce's biggest success stories.
Stock trading is still one of the best on-line businesses. People are flocking to it, talking about it and spending on it like never before. But the number of companies looking for a piece of the action -- and the ferocity with which they are fighting for it -- has made the economics look increasingly dismal. Some people within the industry now fear that it is on the verge of a vicious cycle of rising ad spending, sharper competition and slower growth -- even if the stock market remains robust enough that people are tempted to trade stocks as a hobby.
"I don't think anyone expected that we would see the industry spending over a billion dollars on this market," said J. Peter Ricketts, Ameritrade's senior vice president for marketing and sales. "Not everyone can do well. Some will see diminishing returns."
Ameritrade intends to be one of the winners. That is why the company announced earlier this month that, after reducing ad spending earlier this year to move toward profitability, it has now reversed course. The company has planned a yearlong advertising program it values at $200 million, roughly as much as Mazda spends annually to market vehicles and well over half of what Ameritrade is expected to receive in revenue this year.
Ameritrade, the No. 6 on-line broker, is also a bellwether of another trend: the rising cost of attracting each now customer.
For a time, on-line brokerages seemed to have it easy. For not much more than $100 in ad spending, they could attract a self-motivated trader who would buy and sell stocks and pay commissions at a pace that would return a profit to the brokerage firm in about a year. Better yet, traders, unlike book or computer shoppers, tend to be "sticky," to use E-commerce parlance; they remain loyal to an established relationship.
But a combination of rising ad spending, slowing account growth and the proliferation of on-line brokerages -- there are perhaps 50 with national ambitions and solid financial backing, about 130 all together -- has pushed that cost way up. Ameritrade has warned analysts that it is currently spending about $500 for each new customer it signs up. The company hopes that figure will go down later this year, when it expects a rush of new on-line customers.
E*Trade and National Discount Brokers also say they are now prepared to spend $400 to $500 to sign up each new customer, at least double what it was taking earlier this year. The costs include giveaways like the Sprint long-distance minutes, United Airlines frequent-flier miles and $75 in free trades that E*Trade is using as promotional incentives.
"If they go over $500, the stock trading business stops making sense," said Bill Burnham, a venture capitalist at Softbank Partners and an expert on the on-line brokerage industry. But he observed that the brokerages are reluctant to slash ad spending now, fearing they will be left behind. "It's a war of attrition," he said.
The war is much more typical of consumer products companies, like those selling soda, credit cards, or paper towels, than it is for Wall Street. Only a couple of years ago, $20 million was considered a sizable advertising campaign by Wall Street standards.
E*Trade will not say exactly how much it plans to spend on advertising this year. But industry executives say it has committed to spend about $300 million. That would be more than Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter combined, according to estimates of brokerage firm marketing budgets compiled by Bear, Stearns, the investment bank. The comparison is all the more significant given that Merrill Lynch, which plans to offer $29.95 on-line trading later this year, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which owns the Discover brokerage, have their own on-line offerings to promote.
E*Trade was also the big spender among the on-line brokerages last year (and the second-biggest marketer among on-line companies over all, after Amazon.com). The campaign was widely considered a raging success. The research firm International Data Corporation found that consumers named E*Trade as the dominant on-line broker, even though its 14 percent market share of Internet trading volume is second to Charles Schwab's 25 percent share, says Paul Johnson, an on-line brokerage analyst at International Data. The advertising also made E*Trade the fastest-growing on-line broker as measured by number of new accounts; E*Trade now has an estimated 1.25 million active accounts.
The firm broke new ground among brokerage firms by advertising its services during prime time -- on "Ally McBeal" and "E.R.," for instance, and buying six slots during last winter's Superbowl, the most expensive television time available. It used to be that Wall Street ads appeared only during Sunday morning talk shows and featured narrators intoning about the solidity of a company in a deep baritone, while a camera panned a rock in the sea. E*Trade, in contrast, introduced ads that aimed to be young and hip, and occasionally hilarious.
Its early ads poked fun at hidebound full-service brokers, including a spot that showed a hapless broker waking at dawn to prepare for another day of fruitless cold calling. Now the emphasis is more on empowering investors than dumping brokers.
One new spot shows an on-line trader watching a preview for a new movie starring Anna Nichole Smith. He declares it the worst movie ever, then dumps stock in "Trimount" the Hollywood company that produced it. The point, says Jerry Gramaglia, E*Trade's marketing chief, is that investors can take charge and act immediately to get financial results.
That ad, along with others that include the rich woman and her young man and another depicting a hermit who gets investment advice from the stuffed moose head and woodchuck in his cabin, have garnered enough attention that E*Trade has every intention of keeping its marketing budget "north of our rivals," Mr. Gramaglia said.
He acknowledged that at $400 to $500 the cost of attracting new customers could become prohibitive for the on-line brokers. But he said E*Trade had also diversified the products its offers to include on-line banking, bonds, mortgages and mutual funds, making the old stock-trading business model an anachronism. He also predicted that those who worry too much about average costs per customer might regret it.
"You can drown in a river that averages three feet," he said. "This is about creating the dominant on-line financial brand."
Most of E*Trade's competitors are trying to catch up to its marketing lead -- what people in the ad industry refer to as "share of voice." Charles Schwab, which has seen its market share slip somewhat in recent months, looks set to challenge E*Trade ad dollar for ad dollar over the next year.
"There are some markets where we double our spending and still lose share of voice to them," Len Short, Schwab's executive vice president for advertising, said. "We are not going to be the leader if we underspend the competition."
Mr. Short, who like Mr. Gramaglia is a veteran of long-distance telephone advertising wars in the early 1990's, estimates that it requires about $300 million a year in spending, sustained for many years, to build and maintain a brand as a household name.
Schwab's latest ads have picked up E*Trade's light-hearted tone. In one ad, Ann Kournikova, the teen-age tennis wonder, lectures fellow players about "asset allocation." Mr. Short said the spots aim for a slightly different crowd than the E*Trade ads. Schwab, seeking to highlight its large call-in centers and bricks and mortar offices, boasts about it ability to educate investors and, if necessary, hold their hands while they learn to trade.
None of the other Internet brokerages seems likely to match the marketing spending of E*Trade and Schwab. But Ameritrade promises to come close with its $200 million campaign. Its television spots feature Stuart, a freakishly red-haired teen-ager with a Mohawk haircut and muttonchops who taunts his girlfriend's stockbroker father with his passion for on-line trading. "Believe in yourself" is the theme.
Not long ago, such promises to lift ad spending might have generated positive buzz for the on-line brokerages among investors. The potential for the companies to capture first-time stock traders was considered so great that deficit spending on ads helped pump share prices into the stratosphere. Most on-line brokerage stocks are in fact still up for the year, but many are down close to 60 percent from their April highs. And Wall Street seems less impressed with the marketing promises now.
Richard H. Repetto, an on-line brokerage analyst at Lehman Brothers, rocked the industry recently when he downgraded his recommendations on both E*Trade and Ameritrade to "outperform" from "buy." He cited the increased ad budgets and higher cost of luring new customers as early warning signs of a battle among brokers for new clients that could end up eating away at the business.
"It's not crazy to go after new customers aggressively, given the long-term potential," Mr. Repetto said. "But you have to consider the increased cost of getting more customers and what you have to do to keep them. There comes a time when there has to be a shakeout."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Invests In Campaign To Promote Its Software

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
I.B.M. has long had the dubious distinction of running the biggest software business that nobody ever heard of. But the International Business Machines Corporation plans to change that with a major marketing and advertising campaign that is to begin on Wednesday.
The effort is intended not only to raise the profile of the company's $12 billion-a-year software business, but also to highlight the striking changes I.B.M. has made in its software division recently and to accelerate its growth. 
 The company has much at stake. Software is one of three businesses that Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the I.B.M. chairman, has singled out as engines of the corporation's growth in the future, along with services and the sale of technology to other companies.
The software business has been the laggard of the three until recently. Indeed, I.B.M.'s software sales declined from $12.7 billion in 1995 to $11.2 billion in 1997, before rising a modest 6 percent last year to $11.9 billion. The turnaround seems to be picking up some momentum, with software sales up 10 percent through the first half of 1999. The company's software business is the second largest, after that of the Microsoft Corporation, but I.B.M.'s growth pace remains far slower.
Yet the renewed growth at I.B.M., analysts say, is evidence that the overhaul of I.B.M.'s software business is starting to pay off. Traditionally, the company's software business was tied almost entirely to its mainframe and minicomputer sales. But through acquisitions and internal investment, I.B.M. has pursued a strategy of making sure its powerful data base, networking and other software run on major operating systems -- from Microsoft's Windows NT to Linux, a version of the powerful Unix operating systems whose basic programming code is free.
At the same time, I.B.M. has bet its software future on the Internet. The company's software technology, from mainframes on down, has been retooled so that it lets companies work on the World Wide Web to communicate more efficiently with their employees and sell more effectively to their customers.
No longer the computer industry's reactionary, I.B.M. has been early in making big investments in technologies that represent emerging trends in computing -- notably Java, an Internet programming language, and so-called open-source software, like Linux and Apache, whose underlying, or "source," code is freely available.
Analysts say that I.B.M. has more Java programmers than Sun Microsystems Inc., which developed Java, and that I.B.M. probably also employs more open-source programmers than any other company.
"I.B.M. has done an amazing job at focusing on the Internet," said Carl Howe, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. "A few years ago, the company's software business looked as if it was slowly dying. Today, its software business has the potential to be an incredible asset, if played right."
Capturing its share of the software business as it migrates to the Web is crucial to I.B.M. both financially and strategically. While accounting for about 15 percent of revenue, the business contributed nearly a third of the company's profits last year. And I.B.M.'s pitch to corporate clients of being an across-the-board supplier of technology and know-how for the Internet economy will be suspect if I.B.M. is not a leader in software.
"From I.B.M.'s point of view, it is really important that they don't blow this," said Amy Wohl, president of Amy Wohl Associates, a research firm in Narberth, Pa.
The I.B.M. software advertising campaign will begin on Wednesday with four-page ads in newspapers including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The San Jose Mercury News in California and The Austin American-Statesman in Texas. The national print advertising program, budgeted for $22 million in the fourth quarter, will also include ads in trade magazines like PC Week and Infoworld, and Internet sites, including those for Cnet, Zdnet and the Industry Standard. Roughly 10 to 15 percent of the total budget will be spent on Web ads.
The marketing effort is the first time there has been an umbrella advertising campaign for I.B.M.'s software business. Previously, ads have focused on individual products. The $22 million spent in the fourth quarter also marks the start of a big increase in the software unit's ad spending, from $40 million this year to about $100 million next year as the campaign extends internationally, according to Bill Zeitler, general manager for sales and marketing for the I.B.M. software division.
The ads, created by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, a unit of WPP Group P.L.C., build on I.B.M.'s campaign touting the company's expertise as a supplier of technology for electronic commerce.
That campaign, begun in 1997 and promoting "e-business," was at first criticized by I.B.M.'s rivals as too abstract and not likely to raise sales. But it proved highly successful in positioning I.B.M. as a company at the forefront of electronic commerce, and the term e-business has become common.
One of the software ads, for example, shows a young man sitting amid a bank of escalators, ignored by the crowd, holding a sign. The sign reads: "It takes powerful software to understand the needs of a single customer among millions. That's the software I.B.M. makes."
The campaign's theme, printed in the lower-right corner of all the ads, is: "Software is the soul of e-business."
The ad campaign is meant to back up the new marketing strategy at I.B.M., which groups its products and the efforts of its beefed-up 6,400-person sales force into four categories. The four areas, I.B.M. says, were determined by customer research as key functions of electronic commerce: software for handling transactions; assembling and mining data; improving communications and collaboration in companies, and for managing computer networks.
"It remains to be seen whether it will work," Mr. Howe of Forrester Research noted. "In some ways, it sounds like a return to the approach that was so effective for I.B.M. in the mainframe era, except updated with an e-business spin. I.B.M. is saying, 'Forget about product specifications and the technical trivia, we sell you computing that works.' "

HEADLINE: Financier Is Said to Acquire A Significant Stake in RCN

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Vulcan Ventures Inc., the investment group controlled by Paul Allen, has made its biggest move yet into telecommunications by agreeing to invest about $1.7 billion in the RCN Corporation. The deal is set to be announced today, RCN said yesterday.
RCN, based in Princeton, N.J., is the biggest company competing against the regional Bell carriers in local telephone markets for residential customers rather than corporate clients. RCN also provides cable television and Internet service to its customers, mostly in the Northeast. 
 The stocks of competitive local phone, or exchange, companies (known as CLEC's and pronounced SEE-lecks) have been exceptionally volatile in recent years as investor sentiment has fluctuated about the power of the Bell companies to face competition.
But given Mr. Allen's reputation as a billionaire financier and one of the founders of the Microsoft Corporation, the Vulcan investment may give the CLEC sector a lift.
At least as important, the deal appears to lend some validation to RCN's plan of serving the residential sector rather than the business customers that have been the traditional market of CLEC's.
Additionally, CLEC's of every stripe have traditionally relied heavily on the high-yield bond market for money to build expensive fiber-optic networks. The companies' stocks have sometimes suffered as interest rate concerns have raised questions about their ability to raise money economically. With the Vulcan deal, RCN may be able to insulate itself from those concerns.
"This gives us $4 billion in cash, which is enough capital to build our business without having to go back to the capital market," David C. McCourt, RCN's chairman, said yesterday. He added that with the deal RCN would have enough money to last through 2003 without need of more financing. Before the deal, RCN was faced with the prospect of requiring additional cash in 2001.
"It's validation of our business plan from someone who understands where the telecom industry and the Internet is evolving," he said. "Paul Allen understands the ned for broad-band connections to the home."
Until now, Mr. Allen has invested in broad-band -- or high-capacity -- connections mostly by buying into the cable TV industry. Mr. Allen's cable vehicle, called Charter Communications, has spent more than $6 billion acquiring cable carriers including Avalon Cable Television, Falcon Communications and Fanch Communications.
In August, Vulcan announced a deal to invest in another CLEC, Allegiance Telecom Inc., which focuses on business customers. But that was a much smaller investment, beginning at $75 million and potentially reaching $355 million.
In the RCN deal, Vulcan is to invest $1.65 billion for a stake of roughly 22.7 percent. Vulcan has already bought almost 5 percent of RCN on the open market, an executive close to the deal said, which would bring Vulcan's total interest to about 26.7 percent. But Vulcan's voting interest will be limited to 15 percent.
The new investment is in RCN preferred stock that is convertible into common stock in up to seven years at $62 a share. RCN's shares closed at $38.0625 on Friday, down $2.9375, amid speculation that RCN was considering a diluting acquisition of its own.

HEADLINE: Belarus Sees Its Dissidents Disappearing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 3

 BODY:
As Viktor Gonchar left for his Thursday night trip to the baths, a ritual in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, he told his wife to watch the evening news. The President had excoriated his critics in a speech, and Mr. Gonchar, a leading political dissident, believed a crackdown was imminent.
That was on Sept. 16. Since 10:45 that evening, neither Mr. Gonchar nor his companion at the baths, Anatoly Krasovsky, a publisher, has been seen. 
 "We were under constant surveillance," Mr. Gonchar's wife, Zinaida, said in an interview. "We have the numbers of the cars. One of them is from the state guard of the President. They couldn't disappear without a trace. That's why I don't doubt that this is the work of the authorities."
The two men were the third and fourth people linked to the opposition to vanish since April. The disappearances coincide with the most concerted campaign yet by Belarus's fragmented pro-democracy movement to press the Government for reforms.
There is little evidence to indicate who might be responsible for the four disappearances. The omnipresent security police, who usually track dissidents the way Minsk homemakers pursue infrequent deliveries of fresh chicken, say they have no clues.
But if the President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, is behind the disappearances -- as opponents insist, many Westerners suspect and the Government blandly denies -- it would be a disturbing turn for a tough ruler who has until now merely beaten and jailed his opponents.
The State Department said on Sept. 21 that the United States was greatly concerned by the pattern of disappearances and urged the Government to find and protect those who have vanished.
"The troubling aspect for those of us who have lived here is that we know that this is a fairly tightly controlled society," said an American official in Minsk. "To have no information is in part information by itself. The fact the Government can't say anything at all about these disappearances is a bit strange."
All the more so in the case of the first person to vanish, Tamara Vinnikova, a former chairwoman of the central bank. She was under house arrest and armed Government guard at the time.
The second person to disappear, the former Interior Minister Yuri Zakharenko, was the campaign manager for an opposition politician and former Prime Minister who wants to succeed Mr. Lukashenko.
Mr. Lukashenko, a hard-line Communist, was legally elected President in 1994, but extended his term and replaced the elected Parliament with his own legislators after a constitutional referendum in 1996 that was widely denounced as rigged.
Despite food shortages and staggering inflation, he appeared powerful and even popular until last spring, when dissidents began organizing shadow parliamentary and presidential elections. The aim was to highlight the fact that a new president and Parliament would have taken office this year had the Belarussian Constitution not been replaced.
Since then, the Government has steadily tightened the screws on dissent.
Mr. Gonchar, who organized the shadow elections, was imprisoned in March for 10 days and, his wife said, beaten and force-fed glucose after beginning a hunger strike.
The former Prime Minister, Mikhail Chigir, was arrested and briefly jailed three weeks later, on March 30.
Ms. Vinnikova, the former bank chairwoman, vanished on April 8. She was a supporter of Mr. Chigir who had been accused by the Government of abuse of office and grand larceny. Human rights groups said the charges appeared to have been politically motivated.
Mr. Zakharenko, Mr. Chigir's campaign chairman and a popular figure in the military, dropped out of sight on May 7 as he was walking home.
On July 22, at the height of opposition protests against Mr. Lukashenko's presidency, another opposition leader, the Speaker of the Parliament disbanded by the President, fled to neighboring Lithuania, saying he feared for his safety.
With little hard evidence, the disappearances have become enveloped in rumor and speculation, some inspired by the Government and some by the opposition.
Ms. Vinnikova, who said she knew of shady financial deals at the top of the Government, is said by some in Minsk to have ransomed her way to freedom in Israel. The Government has suggested that investigators look for her in the West.
But neither she nor Mr. Zakharenko has surfaced in more than four months, casting doubt on suggestions that either made it to safety outside Belarus.
The disappearance of Mr. Gonchar and his friend shocked many people in Belarus because there had seemed to be a lull in repression. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was arranging talks between the Government and the dissidents. Mr. Gonchar had been planning to meet members of the disbanded Parliament to select the opposition delegation.
His disappearance has thrown those negotiations into limbo.
American officials said Mr. Lukashenko had originally pledged an all-out effort to find Mr. Gonchar. What the Government has produced, however, is a series of attacks on Mr. Gonchar and his publisher friend that suggest the two men were unable to pay off business or political debts and as a result were kidnapped, or worse.
The first President of democratic Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich, another opposition leader, said in an interview that the Government appeared to have resorted to state terrorism.
"The regime," Mr. Shushkevich said, "has gone along the path of eliminating the leaders against whom it can't open even an artificial criminal case. This is done with the goal of strengthening the dictatorship."
He also said that the West had made the Government's task easier by failing to protest vigorously after the first disappearances in April and May. He noted that the Government opened a criminal inquiry into Mr. Zakharenko's May disappearance only in September, after the United States and Germany had complained about Mr. Gonchar's case.
Zinaida Gonchar said the police appear to be conducting only a cursory search for her husband. The day after he vanished, she said she went with friends to hunt for clues. Near the bathhouse, searchers had found a site where a car appeared to have hit a tree.
There, they found broken headlight glass, trampled grass and stains, which the Government has said are blood.
Mr. Gonchar's Jeep has not been found.

HEADLINE: Akio Morita, Co-Founder of Sony and Japanese Business Leader, Dies at 78

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Akio Morita, the co-founder of the Sony Corporation who personified Japan's rise from postwar rubble to industrial riches and became the unofficial ambassador of its business community to the world, died on Sunday in Tokyo. He was 78.
Mr. Morita died of pneumonia, according to Sony. He had been hospitalized in Tokyo since August, after returning from Hawaii, where he had spent most of his time since suffering a debilitating stroke in November 1993. More than anyone else, it was Mr. Morita and his Sony colleagues who changed the world's image of the term "Made in Japan" from one of paper parasols and shoddy imitations to one of high technology and high reliability in miniature packages. 
 Founded in a bombed-out Tokyo department store after World War II, Sony became indisputably one of the world's most innovative companies, famous for products like the pocket-sized transistor radio, the videocassette recorder, the Walkman and the compact disk.
And Mr. Morita, whose contribution was greater in marketing than in technology, made the Sony brand into one of the best known and most respected in the world. A Harris poll last year showed Sony was the No. 1 brand name among American consumers, ahead of American companies like General Electric and Coca-Cola.
A tireless traveler who moved his family to New York in 1963 for a year to learn American ways, Mr. Morita also spearheaded the internationalization of Japanese business. Sony was the first Japanese company to offer its stock in the United States, in 1961, one of the first to build a factory in the United States, in 1972, and still one of the only ones to have even a couple of Westerners on its board.
Sony also became a major force in the American entertainment business, acquiring CBS Records in 1988 and Columbia Pictures, the Hollywood studio, in 1989. The latter purchase, however, turned into an embarrassing debacle as Sony suffered big losses in Hollywood.
 
A Japanese Executive Americans Recognized
In the process, Mr. Morita, with his white mane and quick tongue, became the unofficial representative of Japan's business community, generally working to smooth trade relations between his country and the United States, but sometimes stirring resentment in both countries with his pointed criticisms.
"He was truly a statesman par excellence in a business sense," said Mike Mansfield, the former senator and United States Ambassador to Japan. "Internationally, he did more for Japan in a business sense than anyone else in Japan."
In Japan, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was one of several hundred people to visit Mr. Morita's Tokyo home following his death, called Mr. Morita "a leading figure who played a pivotal role in developing Japan's postwar economy," according to Kyodo News Service.
Sony's current president, Nobuyuki Idei, said in a statement, "It is not an exaggeration to say that he was the face of Japan."
To the day of his death, nearly six years after the stroke that removed him from an active role in business, he was still no doubt Japan's most famous business executive, and the only one many Americans could name or recognize in a photograph. Time magazine recently selected him as one of 20 "most influential business geniuses" of the 20th century, the only non-American on the list.
In his own country, where executives tend to be self-effacing, Mr. Morita was viewed as a bit flamboyant and arrogant. He was the first to fly around in a corporate business jet and helicopter. He appeared in a television commercial for the American Express card. He served on the boards of three foreign companies. He took up sports like skiing, scuba diving and wind surfing in his sixties. He cavorted with the rock star Cyndi Lauper after Sony bought CBS Records.
Shortly before he suffered his stroke, Mr. Morita made waves in his home country by saying that Japan was like a "fortress" and that its unique business practices were alienating its trading partners. "Although there is much to commend in Japan's economic system, it is simply too far out of sync with the West on certain essential points," he wrote in The Atlantic Monthly in June 1993.
He advocated shorter working hours, more dividends for stockholders of Japanese companies and a sharp cutback in government regulation. Now, as Japan struggles through an economic slump that has lasted most of the decade, some of what Mr. Morita advocated is being adopted.
"Japan was coming closer to him and seeing the need for that kind of leadership," said Yoshihiro Tsurumi, professor of international business at the Baruch Graduate School of Business at the City University of New York.
 
Never Comfortable In West's Business World
 Mr. Morita entertained frequently and counted many American businessmen and politicians as his friends. "He not only made it Sony's business but his own personal business to become intimately acquainted with American society at all levels," said Peter Peterson, an investment banker who is on Sony's board of directors. "I can recall playing golf with Akio, watching him greet and interact with every American C.E.O. on the course, all of whom seemed to know him as a personal friend."
In his book "Sony: The Private Life" (Houghton Mifflin, 1999), John Nathan suggests that Mr. Morita, a Japanese traditionalist at home, was never really comfortable in the Western business world.
Mr. Nathan, a Japanese translator and University of California professor of Japanese culture who was granted free access to Sony executives, quotes Mr. Morita's eldest son, Hideo, as saying of his father, "He had to 'act' -- I'm sorry to use that word but I can't help it -- he had to act as the most international-understanding businessman in Japan." But, Hideo adds, "It was never real."
And Sony's current president, Mr. Idei, is quoted as saying: "Japanese of the generation before mine had an inferiority complex about foreigners. Akio Morita himself was a living inferiority complex."
Despite being virtually synonymous with Sony, especially outside Japan, Mr. Morita did not actually become the company's president until 1971 and its chairman and chief executive until 1976. Before that, he was the junior partner to Masaru Ibuka, an engineering genius who, while not as widely known in the West, is considered in Japan to be the main founder of Sony. Mr. Ibuka died in December 1997 at the age of 89.
 
An Early Fascination Leads to a Career Shift
 Akio Morita was born on Jan. 26, 1921, into a wealthy family in Nagoya, an industrial city in central Japan. As the eldest son, he was groomed from elementary school age to succeed his father as president of the sake brewery that had been in the family for 14 generations.
But in junior high school, Akio became fascinated by his family's phonograph, an appliance rare in Japan at that time. He became an avid electronics hobbyist, building his own crude phonograph and radio receiver. He studied physics at Osaka Imperial University as World War II was starting. Mr. Morita enlisted in the Navy under a program that would allow him to do research instead of serving in combat.
It was while developing heat-seeking weapons that Mr. Morita first worked with Mr. Ibuka, 13 years his senior, who before the war had started an electronic instrument company.
After the war, Mr. Ibuka set up a new company in a bombed-out department store in Tokyo, making kits that converted AM radios into short-wave receivers. Mr. Morita happened to read a newspaper article about this and contacted his old friend. The next year, when Mr. Ibuka wanted to incorporate the company, he asked Mr. Morita to join.
Mr. Morita, Mr. Ibuka and another executive traveled to the Nagoya area to implore Mr. Morita's father to release his son from the family business. The elder Mr. Morita not only agreed, he also later became a financial backer of the new company, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, or the Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, which was inaugurated on May 7, 1946, with an investment of about $500.
The company produced Japan's first reel-to-reel magnetic tape recorder. A few years later it licensed the rights to the transistor from Bell Laboratories, after overcoming resistance from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Bell Labs officials warned that the only consumer use would be for hearing aids.
But Sony used them to produce Japan's first transistor radio in 1955. (An American company, Regency, produced the world's first a few months earlier but did not succeed in selling it.) In 1957, Sony came out with what it termed a pocket-sized transistor radio. But the radio was actually a bit too big for most pockets, so Mr. Morita had Sony salesmen wear special shirts with extra-large pockets.
There followed the Trinitron television in 1968; the first successful home VCR, the Betamax, in 1975; the Walkman personal stereo in 1979, and the compact disk, developed with Philips N.V. of the Netherlands, in 1982.
Not all products were successful. Sony has stumbled several times trying to sell personal computers. And in 1981, Mr. Morita announced the Mavica, a digital camera that recorded pictures on a floppy disk instead of on film. But the camera did not come to market and critics accused Mr. Morita of making a premature announcement to burnish Sony's image as an innovator.
 
Steering Consumers To Products They Want
 Mr. Morita did not believe in market research. "Our plan is to lead the public with new products rather than ask them what kind of products they want," he declared in his autobiography, "Made in Japan," (E. P. Dutton, 1986), written with the journalists Edwin M. Reingold and Mitsuko Shimomura. "The public does not know what is possible, but we do."
Mr. Morita prided himself in particular on the Walkman, the portable stereo cassette player with headphones. Actually, according to the company's official corporate history, it was Mr. Ibuka who came up with the idea for the portable product. But Mr. Morita pressed hard for the project, overcoming resistance within Sony to a tape player that, in its early versions, could not record. Mr. Morita, despite initial reservations about the awkward name, eventually ordered all Sony subsidiaries around the world to begin using it.
From the start of the company, however, Mr. Morita was much more involved in marketing, while Mr. Ibuka handled technology development. And from the start, he had an international orientation, traveling to New York and Europe in the 1950's to sell the company wares.
Such international focus was needed because as a new company, Sony had some trouble breaking into its home market, where more established manufacturers had close relationships with retailers. Indeed, Japan's other big postwar success, the Honda Motor Company, also succeeded first in the United States and to this day sells more cars in America than in Japan.
Mr. Morita soon realized that the company needed a name that foreigners could pronounce and remember. So in 1958 the company name was changed to Sony, derived from the Latin sonus, meaning sound, and from the American vernacular "sonny boy," which Mr. Morita hoped would purvey a young image.
One of Mr. Morita's cardinal tenets was to foster and protect the company's brand name. Early on, Bulova, the watch company, said it would order 100,000 radios but would sell them under its own name. Mr. Morita turned down the huge order. His colleagues back in Tokyo thought he was crazy. But, Mr. Morita wrote in his autobiography, "I said then and I have said it often since: It was the best decision I ever made."
Mr. Morita's worst decision might have been with the Betamax, the first successful consumer VCR. Sony did not readily license its technology to other electronics companies. So most of its Japanese rivals banded together behind the VHS system, which offered longer recording time. Eventually, the Betamax was run out of the market.
Sony evolved into a company that, by Japanese standards at least, was very Westernized, though in many ways it was traditionally Japanese. All company employees, from the president on down, wore company jackets, a common practice in Japan. But Sony's uniforms were created by the designer Issey Miyake.
Mr. Morita first criticized some of his country's business practices in 1966, when he wrote a book, published in Japanese, with a title that might loosely translate as "An Essay on the Useless School Career." He criticized Japanese companies for hiring and promoting people based only on what college they had attended. Sony stopped even asking applicants the name of their college, and it was one of the first Japanese companies to base salaries partly on merit instead of solely on seniority.
 
Tried to Reduce U.S. Trade Tensions
Perhaps because of Sony's dependence on exports, Mr. Morita tried to reduce trade tensions with the United States. In the late 1960's, Sony forged a temporary joint venture with Texas Instruments Inc., then the world's leading semiconductor company, allowing it to set up operations in Japan.
In 1972, Mr. Morita set up a subsidiary to export American products, like Regal cookware and Whirlpool refrigerators, to Japan.
"Selling pans and cookware and refrigerators was not our bag, but Akio believed in doing something for the U.S.-Japan relationship," said Sadami (Chris) Wada, who ran that effort and then handled government relations for the Sony Corporation of America for many years. The operation was abandoned some years later as unsuccessful.
In 1988, Mr. Morita founded the Council for Better Corporate Citizenship, made up of Japanese companies. At a time when Japanese politicians were angering African-Americans with insensitive remarks, one of the council's first projects was to make thousands of copies of an abridged version of "Eyes on the Prize," the American television documentary about the struggle of blacks for equal rights, and distribute it to high schools in Japan.
Mr. Morita was not averse to using his influence among American politicians and business executives to lobby for Sony. He barnstormed the United States in 1984, meeting with governors and with President Reagan, threatening to build Sony factories only in states that did not have the "unitary tax," which was levied against a multinational corporation's global earnings, not just those in the state. Eventually California and other states scrapped the tax.
But while Mr. Morita was often perceived as a friend of the United States, he was often critical of it and proud of being Japanese, flying his country's flag over Sony's New York showroom when it opened in 1962. He often told a story of how ashamed he was on his first trip to Germany in 1953. At a restaurant, he ordered ice cream, and it was served with a small paper parasol stuck in it. "This is from your country," the waiter said.
 
Hailing the Success Of the Japanese Way
 In the 1980's, when Japan seemed on top of the world, Mr. Morita was among the most vocal of the Japanese executives in criticizing American business and hailing the success of the Japanese model.
He said American managers were financial paper shufflers who "can see only 10 minutes ahead" and were not interested in building for the long term. And he said that because American companies were losing interest in manufacturing, the United States was "abandoning its status as an industrial power." Those factors, he said, and not trade barriers, were the reason for America's trade deficit with Japan.
"There are few things in the United States that Japanese want to buy, but there are a lot of things in Japan that Americans want to buy," he wrote in 1989. "This is at the root of the trade imbalance. The problem arises in that American politicians fail to understand this simple fact."
In 1989, Mr. Morita was the co-author, along with a nationalist politician, Shintaro Ishihara, of "The Japan That Can Say No," a book that urged Japan to stand up to American trade demands, which it said were motivated partly by racism. The book also said Japan had the power to change the world balance of power by selling its advanced computer chips to the Soviet Union instead of the United States.
Even though those strident remarks were generally in the chapters Mr. Ishihara wrote, the book created a stir when an unauthorized translation made its way around Washington. Mr. Morita frantically back-pedaled, saying the book had not been intended for an American audience. And he refused to authorize an English translation.
 
$3.2 Billion Lost In Hollywood Venture
It was later that year that Sony paid $3.4 billion to buy Columbia Pictures, a purchase driven largely by Mr. Morita, who thought that if Sony had owned a studio issuing movies in the Beta format, it would not have lost the VCR wars.
Although Sony prided itself on being more Americanized than its Japanese rivals, the purchase became a lightning rod for American concern about a wave of Japanese acquisitions of American companies and real estate. "Japan Invades Hollywood" read the cover of Newsweek. In Japan as well, Sony came in for criticism for stirring up anti-Japanese feeling in the United States.
Mr. Morita had a simple answer. "If you don't want Japan to buy it, don't sell it," he told a New York Times reporter shortly after the purchase. Nevertheless, sensitive to concerns, he promised that the studio would be run by Americans and would be free even to make a movie critical of Japan's emperor.
Worse than misjudging the political reaction, however, the seemingly sophisticated Sony proved to be a babe in the woods in Hollywood.
Sony is generally considered to have overpaid for the studio, and it paid several hundred million dollars more to hire managers away from Warner Brothers -- provoking a costly fight with that studio. Those managers, in turn, spent money extravagantly and produced a string of box office bombs. Mr. Morita and his successor as Sony chief executive, Norio Ohga, perhaps because they were worried about stirring up anti-Japanese sentiment, exercised little oversight.
In late 1994, in one of the most embarrassing moments in its history, Sony announced that it would suffer a loss of $3.2 billion from its investment in Hollywood. But it has stuck with the studio, now called Sony Pictures Entertainment, and appears to be turning it around.
The Morita name will live on at Sony because many members of Mr. Morita's family are involved in the company.
Besides his wife, Mr. Morita is survived by his wife, Yoshiko; his eldest son, Hideo, who now runs the sake brewery and other family businesses; a younger son, Masao, an executive with Sony Music Entertainment in Japan; and a daughter, Naoko Okada, who also lives in Japan. He is also survived by his brother Kazuaki, who volunteered to take over the family sake brewery in Mr. Morita's stead; another brother, Masaaki, a long-time Sony executive, and a sister, Kikuko Iwama, who was married to the late Kazuo Iwama, a former president of Sony.
 
A Longtime Outsider Is Embraced at Last
 In the 1990's, corporate Japan, worried about escalating trade tensions, turned to Mr. Morita, whom it once considered an arrogant maverick, to be its official leader. Mr. Morita was slated to become chairman of Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business lobbying organization, a post that had always gone to the head of a company in an old-line heavy industry like steel.
But on Nov. 30, 1993, while playing his usual 7 A.M. Tuesday tennis game, Mr. Morita suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. A year later, just days after Sony announced its huge Hollywood loss, Mr. Morita, in a wheelchair, attended a Sony board meeting in Tokyo and resigned as chairman.
He had spent much of his time since then undergoing rehabilitation at his beachfront home near Diamond Head on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. At first, Mr. Morita was able to speak a little, shake hands and hit back tennis balls spit out by a machine, according to Mr. Wada, the retired Sony government relations manager.
But more recently, Mr. Wada said, Mr. Morita had lost the ability to speak and communicated mainly through eye contact with his wife. The couple's Christmas greeting card last year had a message from Mrs. Morita saying her husband rose at 6 A.M., retired at 9 P.M. and spent much of the day in rehabilitation. "He may be overeating," she said, mentioning his fondness for eel.
Until he was taken to the hospital in Tokyo in August, Mr. Morita had not returned to Japan for more than two years because of concerns that flying would further damage his health. He did not attend the 1997 funeral of Mr. Ibuka.
But Sony officials still visited him in Hawaii to keep him up to date on the business and show him new products. In January 1998, some 200 executives, friends and dignitaries came to Hawaii to attend a party for Mr. Morita's 77th birthday, considered a lucky age in Japan.

Chart: "Sony and Japan, Growing Up Together"
When Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka co-founded the company that became Sony, it was considered an upstart. As it grew, though, it became one of the most recognized companies in the world, symbolizing postwar Japan's success. More than any other person, Mr. Morita, often referred to as Mr. Sony, was credited with the company's rise. Here is the company's history under his stewardship.
 
MAY 7, 1946 Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka, two young engineers, incorporate Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation), also called Totsuko. The company has 20 employees.
 
Early products include electrically heated seat cushions, electronic megaphones and audio control consoles.
 
1950 After hearing an American tape recorder, Morita and Ibuka decide to build their own. The result is the G-type recorder, left, for institutional use. (The G stood for government.) A consumer model, the H-type, becomes the company's first big consumer product.
 
1951 Totsuko has sales of $430,500 ($2.7 million in 1999 dollars) and 159 employees.
 
1952 The American occupation of Japan ends.
 
1953 On his first trip to the United States, Morita obtains the rights to make transistors.
 
1954 Totsuko creates the first Japanese transistors and begins selling them for $11.11 each. Though they have no use for them, Japanese consumers buy them as fast as Totsuko can make them.
 
1955 Totsuko begins selling the first Japanese transistor radio, right, under the brand name Sony. Years later, Morita recalled how the name was selected: Mr. Ibuka and I worked together, checking many dictionaries, and we found two terms, sonus, a Latin word meaning sound, and sonny boy. So, we thought: We are a group of sonny boys in the sonus business. So we combined sonus and sonny and came up with Sony.
 
Japan's gross national product is $262 per person ($1,608 in 1999 dollars); 39 million people work in the private sector.
 
1956 Totsuko has 483 employees, all shown above, and sales of $3.35 million ($20.26 million in 1999 dollars).
 
Japan is admitted to the United Nations.
 
1957 Totsuko develops a pocket-sized transistor radio, the TR-63, but it is a bit larger than a pocket on a business shirt. So Morita has shirts custom-made for his sales people with pockets big enough to hold the radios.
 
January 1958 Totsuko renames itself Sony and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
 
1959 Sony builds the first transistor television set, the TV8-301, right. The sets are expensive and unreliable and they do not sell well.
 
1960 Sony founds the Sony Corporation of America, and soon Morita moves to America to oversee the expansion.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
A Congressman's Lament on the State of Democracy

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER 30 years in Congress, David Obey is in the slough of despond.
"The democratic system in this country is in crisis as never before in my lifetime," he mourns. "It's the ultimate destruction of the legislative process." 
 This is the jeremiad of a man in the minority. Politicians and pundits asking "Where's the outrage?" are not listening to Mr. Obey, the reigning Cassandra of Congress and the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.
Mr. Obey headed that committee, which presides over Congressional spending, in 1994 and 1995. But the fall of the Democrats four years ago left him wandering in the wilderness, able to prevent things from happening from time to time but unable to accomplish much.
Now he sees Congress tying itself in angry knots, trying and failing to pass a budget he describes as a political document designed to cheat the little guy and trick him into thinking all is well.
"What enrages me is that this is the only forum we have to try to solve problems the country has that are so big they can't be solved any other place," said Mr. Obey (pronounced OH-bee), who has grown a gnomish beard and sharpened his tongue in exile. "Congress should try to do a few things that are very important. But this place has done nothing this year but engage in a shell game on the budget."
The game maddens Mr. Obey, the only chairman alive to have completed all 13 spending bills on time, by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. He did it in 1995.
He argues that Republican militants have hijacked the spending bills and turned them into "partisan war zones." The result, he says, is that the bills cannot pass. He may be right: today 8 of the 13 bills are incomplete, the Government is running on a three-week stop-gap resolution, and many late nights of angry debate await him and the rest of the Congress.
He may relish the arguments, but not the atmosphere in which Congress is making them.
"They pass meaningless resolutions that praise God, motherhood and country but don't do anything," he said. "They stick it to little people, because little people don't have access to information and can't fight back. They rely on a huge tub of money that flows into their party coffers to drown out objections. They have a huge juggernaut of private foundation money organized by the right-wing economic elite and they pour money into these so-called think tanks to pretend that independent research verifies their world view."
MR. OBEY is not a cartoon liberal. He opposes abortion and gun control, and his politics come from the populist roots of his neck of the woods in northern Wisconsin, where Mr. Obey was raised, the son of a factory worker. But having spent half his life in Congress since being elected in 1969, he longs for the days when the old bulls of the Democratic Party ruled and did business with the old bulls among the Republicans.
"This place used to be able to argue over real differences in an understandable way," he said. "Things got done because you had a collective determination that things needed to be done. We got through World War II and the years after because we had a national consensus about what our national interests were abroad and what things we needed to do at home to make the economy work and how to make this a more fair society."
But now, he says, that consensus has unraveled.
Appropriations is all about minding details and making deals involving billions of dollars; every member of Congress hungers for a slice of the pie to feed the folks back home. Mr. Obey succeeded in part because he had the ability to say no, even to his allies.
This year, as each of the 13 spending bills has slowly wended its way through the subcommittees, Mr. Obey has been saying no for days on end, sitting like a vulture on a limb, waiting to pounce on measures he considers cruel, absurd or both. A typical moment came on Thursday, as the House Appropriations Committee approved a spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education -- and along with it, a Republican plan to delay a Federal tax break for working-class families.
"This is as bad a bill as this committee has ever produced," Mr. Obey said. "It should be defeated and placed in a file cabinet and hidden deep in the bowels of the Capitol, and we should collectively agree to deny that this committee ever considered such legislation."
Mr. Obey was defeated, as he often is these days, on a straight party-line vote.
Married and the father of two sons, Mr. Obey takes solace in political isolation from playing harmonica in an unusual bluegrass band, known as Dave Obey and the Capitol Offenses. The band features his family and friends, including his sons, Craig and Douglas, on guitars, and John Holum, the Under Secretary of State for arms control, on banjo.
Their new album, just released, includes an Irish patriot's song, "The Town I Loved So Well," whose last stanza might as well be about the lost Washington Mr. Obey laments:
Now what's done is done and what's won is won
And what's lost is lost and gone forever
I can only pray for a bright brand new day
For the town I loved so well

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Clever Beasts And Burdens On Their City

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
FROM a public relations standpoint, animals have been problematic for New York. Besides the burgeoning populations of rats and cockroaches, there is our famous four-legged neurotic, Gus, the polar bear in the Central Park Zoo who required the services of a therapist from California.
There's also Dan, the veteran alpha male gorilla at the Bronx Zoo so inept at breeding -- he's never been observed even trying -- that he's about to be replaced by a more sophisticated silverback from Salt Lake City. Even our squirrels turned into a media liability a few years ago when a London newspaper falsely reported that they'd become addicted to crack by licking vials in Central Park. 
 Now we must contend with "The Parrot's Lament" (Dutton), the latest book from Eugene Linden analyzing the intelligence and creativity of animals -- chiefly other cities' animals. Mr. Linden, who lives in Nyack, N.Y., had to go far from home to find the most enterprising creatures.
His book describes a California parrot with a mordant sense of humor and a leopard in India that crosses a river by canoe. An orangutan in Cleveland is an astonishing escape artist, which may or may not say something about living in Cleveland. A chimp at the National Zoo has mastered bribery, which definitely says something about living in Washington.
The apes in Atlanta and London have burnished their cities' reputations as financial centers by using keys and tokens to become shrewd traders, bankers and even counterfeiters. The home of Microsoft, not surprisingly, is a hub of creativity and deception.
"Seattle's orangutans and gorillas," Mr. Linden said, "have developed a series of remarkably complex algorithms for extracting extra food from keepers and hiding it from their rivals. They've even mastered the basics of real-estate subdivision."
New York animals have more limited and old-fashioned skills, as Mr. Linden demonstrated Thursday afternoon on a visit to the Bronx Zoo. He started off with two elephants, Maxine and Patty, whose keepers try to lure them inside at the end of the day by putting food in their night cages.
Instead of both elephants going inside to nibble, they've learned to take turns, with one remaining outside to prevent the keepers from locking the door. They get extra time outside and extra food by maintaining the sort of solidarity for which New York unions are famous.
"You could think of the elephants as abiding by strict union work rules," Mr. Linden explained. "New York animals may not be as creative as others, but they know how to profit by placing themselves between you and your goal. The more they get involved with a job, the slower it goes and the more it costs."
THE master of the work slowdown in Mr. Linden's book is a gorilla at the Bronx Zoo named Huerfanita. At the old ape house she extorted bribes -- bananas -- at day's end by blocking the doorway of the night cage. She learned to move quickly into place whenever a keeper said, "Shut the door," and she even foiled the keepers when they switched to codes like, "The fat lady sings."
But Huerfanita has abandoned extortion and gone straight. She seems happier in the roomy accommodations at the $43 million Congo Gorilla Forest, which opened in June, and she has thrived since the keepers gave her custody of an infant rescued from a neglectful mother named Paki.
"Paki's kind of a goofy gorilla," Denise Heinzinger, the senior keeper, said on Thursday, pointing to a skinny, wild-eyed female wandering around. Paki looked to be the gorilla most likely to be accused by a London newspaper of being a crackhead.
Huerfanita, calmly carrying the adopted infant on her back, appeared to be thoroughly rehabilitated. Or maybe she was never that bad to begin with. Maybe it was society's fault.
"She was misunderstood," Mrs. Heinzinger said. "She resisted going inside the old place because she didn't want to be in that small space with a group that didn't accept her. Now there's more room in the new quarters, and she feels more comfortable with the group because the little boy has raised her status."
What did this transformation say about New York? Will it improve our image?
"Well," Mr. Linden replied, "only in New York could socially conscious humans rescue someone from a life of crime thanks to a hands-on foster care program and a $43 million public housing project. I guess that's a good thing. But it may not be an economic model for other cities."

HEADLINE: Gore Will Keep Campaign Chairman Despite Report of Mismanagement at World Exposition

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said today that his campaign chairman would stay on despite a Government report criticizing him for questionable expenses and payments during his tenure as head of the United States pavilion at last year's World Exposition in Portugal.
"He is staying," Mr. Gore said of his chairman, Tony Coelho, a former California Congressman. 
 The report, by the United States Information Agency's inspector general, said Mr. Coelho and officials of the information agency mismanaged the American participation at the fair. He was the unpaid commissioner general of the project.
Mr. Gore, speaking on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," did not respond directly when asked whether Mr. Coelho had done anything wrong or whether he had full confidence in him. "I haven't seen this report," Mr. Gore replied, "but I know him, and he is going to continue doing the terrific job he's been doing as my campaign chair." The Vice President dismissed the matter as "inside baseball" and said voters were not interested in it.
Stan Brand, a lawyer representing Mr. Coelho, said today that the inspector general's report had not recommended any action against Mr. Coelho but had focused instead on changing the way the United States participates in expositions like the one in Portugal. Among other things, the report criticized the agency's hiring of Mr. Coelho's niece, questionable payments to consultants and other financial and personnel practices.
"It contained no recommendations about referrals, prosecution, charging or scoring any individual for doing anything wrong," said Mr. Brand, who said Mr. Coelho himself would not discuss the report at this time. "Generally, there was no recommendation for action, and I think that is significant."
Mr. Brand disputed the inspector general's assertion that the Government might be held liable for repaying a $300,000 loan Mr. Coelho received from a Portuguese bank, which was used to help pay for a memorial wall built at the fair. He said the loan has been "mostly paid off" and would be completely paid back either with Mr. Coelho's own money or with contributions to a nonprofit foundation that was established to finance the memorial.
In addition to his defense of Mr. Coelho, Mr. Gore made a strong appeal today to the core voters of the Democratic Party. He attacked his sole challenger for the Democratic Presidential nomination, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, as a disloyal Democrat. The Vice President also explained his support for President Clinton during the impeachment process as a necessary step to halt the Republicans from what Mr. Gore called the inappropriate punishment of ousting him from office. "We were in the midst of political combat," he said.
The questions about Mr. Coelho come at a bad time for Mr. Gore. The Vice President, who acknowledged last week that he needed to reinvigorate his campaign to fend off a growing challenge from Mr. Bradley, is in the midst of an overhaul.
He is moving his headquarters from Washington to Nashville and is relying on Mr. Coelho, who is in charge of the move, more than ever. Mr. Coelho is one of only two of his closest advisers -- the other is Carter Eskew, Mr. Gore's media consultant -- who are definitely moving to Nashville, creating a certain upheaval and flux as Mr. Gore changes pollsters and loses other advisers and support staff.
At the same time, Mr. Eskew has been criticized for working for tobacco companies in their effort to undercut support for a planned Federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry. Mr. Gore has supported antismoking drives. After The New York Times made inquiries into Mr. Eskew's ties to the tobacco companies, Mr. Eskew said he would sever them. Mr. Gore dismissed this matter too, saying voters did not care what clients his advisers had served in the past.
Mr. Gore's appearance today on "Face the Nation" was in itself a sign of a change in his campaign. Although he has been interviewed on several other television programs, he had not appeared on the Sunday morning talk circuit in more than two years.
The Vice President took the opportunity to paint Mr. Bradley as disloyal to the Democratic Party, citing what he said were two defining moments: Mr. Bradley's support for former President Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economic program and his leaving the Senate, in effect abandoning the party, when Representative Newt Gingrich, a Republican, became the Speaker in 1995.
"Bill Bradley voted for Reaganomics, he voted for all those budget cuts; I did not," Mr. Gore said. Of Mr. Gingrich's takeover of the House, Mr. Gore said: "At that moment, I tried to help rally the troops, the forces of what I regard as progress, and Senator Bradley chose that moment to say that he was going to leave the public arena, that it was broken and that he might even run as the independent, which would have elected Bob Dole and would have given the Republicans control of both the Congress and the executive branch."
Eric Hauser, a spokesman for Mr. Bradley, said the Vice President's appearance today showed the difference between the two campaigns. He said Mr. Gore was focusing on narrow tactical moves and negative campaigning, while Mr. Bradley had offered a comprehensive health care program with a price tag last week and would announce another program this week on work and families.
Mr. Hauser said that Mr. Bradley had supported the Reagan budget cuts but also opposed the Reagan tax cuts and that had that combination passed, the nation would have been spared the ensuing budget deficits.
On the topic of President Clinton, Mr. Gore offered a new explanation for his defense of the President on the day last December that the House voted to impeach him. "The Republican Senate was about to try to remove him from office for an offense which, while terrible, was in the judgment of the American people not one that justified removal from office," Mr. Gore said.
"We were in the midst of political combat," he added, "and I think that fighting back to try to prevent a political injustice from occurring justifies drawing the line in the sand and saying hold on here, look at the great achievements that we have."
He agreed with the suggestion that Mr. Clinton had degraded the Presidency but said Mr. Clinton had recovered. "This election in the year 2000 is not about Bill Clinton, it's not about the past, it's about the future," Mr. Gore said when asked whether he was burdened by what the pundits call Clinton fatigue.
Mr. Gore indicated that he intended to step out more from Mr. Clinton's shadow. The overhaul of his campaign, he said, gives him "an even better chance to define my candidacy in terms of what I'm saying to the American people as a candidate for President, not as someone who is Vice President and defined in those terms."

HEADLINE: House Bills Diverge Over a Patient's Right to Sue

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
When the House of Representatives takes up legislation to define patients' rights this week, it will have a choice of three major bills that take very different approaches to regulating health insurance and health maintenance organizations.
And that does not count a separate bill, passed by the Senate in July, on a vote largely along party lines. 
 All the bills would create a wide range of new Federal rights for patients, setting national standards in a field regulated mainly by the states for 50 years. The bills would, for example, guarantee coverage of emergency medical care, allow patients to appeal coverage decisions to an independent board and insure that doctors could share information with patients.
The biggest difference among the bills involves a relatively simple question: whether patients could sue H.M.O.'s to enforce their rights.
In the last 25 years, Federal and state judges have limited a patient's right to sue in dozens of court decisions interpreting a 1974 law that was meant to protect pension and health benefit plans against the conflicting mandates of different states. But in recent months, judges have issued rulings that are more receptive to lawsuits attacking the quality of care provided by health plans.
One of the House bills, favored by President Clinton, most House Democrats and more than 20 Republicans, would allow patients to sue health plans in state courts for damages if the patients were harmed by a denial of treatment. The bill, which would set the most stringent and comprehensive standards for H.M.O.'s, was written by Representatives Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, and John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan.
Dr. Norwood, a dentist, insists that health plans must be held more accountable for the decisions they and their doctors make. He has repeatedly defied the leaders of his party by demanding a vote on his bill. Dr. Norwood and Mr. Dingell say their bill has more support than any alternative. But they have no assurance that they will prevail because it is unclear how their bill might be amended in debate.
Some Republicans support the right to sue, but believe Dr. Norwood and Mr. Dingell go too far. These lawmakers favor a bill by two House Republicans, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John Shadegg of Arizona, that would allow patients to sue in Federal court, where it is believed that juries are less likely to return big verdicts against health plans.
Under the Coburn-Shadegg bill, an injured patient could sue an H.M.O. or an insurance company that failed to exercise "ordinary care" in deciding whether a service was covered under a health plan. The plaintiff would have to show that the H.M.O.'s decision was the "proximate," or most significant, cause of the patient's injury or death.
Two other bills -- one introduced in the House by Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, and the bill passed by the Senate -- would not create any new right to sue. Employers of all sizes, H.M.O.'s and insurers say such lawsuits would increase the cost of insurance, so fewer people could afford it.
Dr. Coburn, a family doctor, and Mr. Shadegg offer their proposal as a middle ground between the Norwood-Dingell bill and the Boehner bill.
Business groups see the Boehner bill as "the best among a series of bad options," as the National Association of Manufacturers put it.
"With its reliance on mandates, the Boehner bill is more reform than we need," said Patrick Cleary, vice president of the association. "But of the three major health care bills, it is the one that does the least damage to the employer-based health care system."
On the other hand, Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group, said: "The Boehner bill is the proposal supported by those who want to kill patients' rights legislation. It offers very weak protections and includes poison pills that would make any real patients' rights bill impossible to enact."
Mr. Pollack observed that "the context of the debate has changed radically in the last three to five years." The best evidence of the change is that conservatives like Mr. Boehner are now proposing Federal regulation of the health insurance industry, if only to fend off more stringent rules proposed by Democrats, consumer advocates, labor unions and doctors.
The three major House bills apply to all forms of individual and group health insurance, H.M.O.'s and other types of managed care.
The scope of the Senate bill is more limited, and more confusing. Some protections apply to the 48 million people in group health plans regulated exclusively by the Federal Government; some apply to 124 million who get coverage through their employers; some apply to 140 million with group or individual insurance.
Republican senators said they devised this because they wanted to let states continue as the primary regulators of health insurance. The H.M.O. industry did not seek this arrangement.
"We never campaigned for that provision of the Senate bill," said Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans.
Most patients are unlikely to sue. They want to get health care when they need it, and they cannot afford to litigate for years. All the House and Senate bills would address their needs by establishing new rights for patients to appeal the denial of claims for benefits. Patients could appeal first within a health plan and then, if necessary, to an independent panel of medical experts.
For years, the insurance industry has opposed new Federal requirements. But now, with some patients and politicians demanding action to rein in H.M.O's, Ms. Ignagni said, "We are very comfortable with the idea of objective external review," provided, of course, that there is no new right to sue.
In general, all four bills would allow a patient to appeal a decision holding that a service was medically unnecessary or experimental, and therefore not covered. But the standards of review and the procedures differ.
Under all the bills, a health plan that refuses to comply with the decision of an independent review panel would be subject to financial penalties.
Because the Boehner bill does not create any new right to sue, the decision of "external reviewers" would be final.
Under the Coburn-Shadegg bill, patients could sue in Federal court if they suffered physical injury because of a health plan's negligence. Before going to court, patients would have to use the appeals process established by their H.M.O. In court, damages for pain and suffering would be limited to $250,000 or twice the amount of any economic loss, whichever was greater. Patients could not recover punitive damages unless a health plan had acted with "conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety" of patients.
Under the Norwood-Dingell bill, an injured patient could sue an H.M.O. in state court regardless of whether the patient had gone through the health plan's appeal procedure.

HEADLINE: Unburdening the Third World

 BODY:
President Clinton made a dramatic and important announcement last Wednesday when he pledged to cancel the debt owed to Washington by the world's poorest nations, as long as they used the savings for health, education and other anti-poverty programs. His promise comes on top of an Administration pledge the week before to seek $1 billion for an initiative that would mainly retire poor nations' debts to international lenders. It is now up to Congress to provide the money, and other wealthy nations to match Mr. Clinton's commitment.
The debt owed by the poorest nations -- most of the 36 countries covered by the President's announcement are in Africa -- helps trap them in misery. Most of these nations are paying debt service on loans from decades ago, when irresponsible lenders pushed profligate governments to borrow. Their creditors long ago concluded they would never be repaid, but some countries spend 60 percent of their budget to keep rolling over these debts. The burden has cut into spending on education and other social programs. In some countries in Africa, the entire health budget comes to only $6 or $7 a year per person. 
 The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund began a program to try to reduce these debts in 1996. But only four nations have qualified -- Uganda, Bolivia, Mali and Guyana -- and it took years of I.M.F.-imposed austerity do so. A worldwide advocacy movement called Jubilee 2000, which includes religious groups, development organizations and artists, has led a campaign for more debt relief. At a June meeting in Cologne, Germany, the world's seven wealthiest nations agreed to forgive more of the debt owed by the poorest nations to rich countries and international lenders. The Cologne initiative was an improvement, but it still fell short of what poor countries need.
Each wealthy country pledged to forgive some of the debt it was owed and pay for a portion of the debt owed to the World Bank. Governments are famous for failing to honor these commitments, but Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers announced recently that the Administration would ask Congress for the full amount it had pledged. The President then followed with his decision to cancel the rest of the debt owed directly to Washington.
Debt relief is a bargain for the United States, which had lent comparatively little to poor countries and has already written off most of the loans. The nations that could qualify for the President's plan owe the United States $5.7 billion, but canceling that entire amount will cost Washington only about $450 million because of earlier write-offs. Perhaps as important as Washington's debt forgiveness, President Clinton's announcement will challenge other nations to meet and go beyond their pledges in Cologne and cancel their own debts.
A few nations will qualify for the debt relief by the end of this year, and Mr. Clinton said that three-quarters of the highly indebted countries could get relief next year. The international community must watch carefully to insure that the money saved does benefit the poor. A well-run program can make a big difference. Two years ago in Uganda, for example, half the children of primary-school age stayed home, mainly because their families could not pay school fees. But Uganda used most of its $40 million in debt relief to cancel those fees, and this year 90 percent of the children go to school. Now, it will qualify for another $40 million of relief. Congress should quickly approve the President's request, which is a pittance for America but can improve the lives of the most needy worldwide.

HEADLINE: MORE AMERICANS WERE UNINSURED IN 1998, U.S. SAYS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The number of Americans without health insurance rose last year by 833,000, to 44.3 million, despite a strong economy and a new law intended to provide coverage for children, the Census Bureau reported today.
The ranks of the uninsured have grown by more than 4.5 million since President Clinton took office in 1993, promising health insurance for all Americans. 
 Since the failure of Mr. Clinton's effort to have Congress approve a comprehensive health care proposal in 1994, the President and Congress have agreed on a series of incremental laws intended to expand coverage. But health policy experts say the continued increase in the number of the uninsured raises questions about the effectiveness of that strategy.
The Census Bureau report comes just three days before the House is scheduled to take up legislation defining a range of new patients' rights.
Many Republicans, insurance companies and business groups have opposed such legislation, saying it would raise premiums and contribute to further increases in the number of uninsured, a contention disputed by many Democrats.
At the same time, the plight of the uninsured is emerging as a major issue in the 2000 Presidential campaign, with former Senator Bill Bradley calling for a renewed commitment to providing every American with access to coverage.
The Census Bureau said 16.3 percent of Americans did not have health insurance last year. That figure, the highest in a decade, was up slightly from 16.1 percent in 1997.
In households with annual incomes of $50,000 or more, the number of people without health insurance increased 1.7 million last year, to 12.2 million, the bureau said.
"This is a troubling trend," said Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House.
The data for 1998 are somewhat surprising because the economy was vibrant, family income was up, the unemployment rate was at the lowest level in nearly three decades and employers were competing for workers in many parts of the country.
Health policy experts gave several possible reasons for the increase in the number of uninsured.
Some employers have cut health benefits for employees or their dependents. Many employers still offer coverage but require employees to pay more, and many low-income workers say they cannot afford the premiums. Most of the jobs created in the last few years are in small businesses, which are less likely to offer health benefits. Finally, many people leaving welfare have lost Medicaid coverage without getting any insurance to replace it.
The Census Bureau found that the number of women without health insurance rose last year by 947,000, to 21.3 million, while the number of men without coverage declined by 116,000, to 23 million. In the last five years, the bureau said, the number of women without insurance has increased by 3.2 million, while the number of uninsured men rose 1.4 million.
In 1997, Congress created a special health insurance program for children, and Mr. Clinton has repeatedly prodded Federal and state officials to enroll eligible children.
But the Census Bureau said the number of children under 18 without health insurance increased last year by 330,000, to 11.1 million, following a rise of 188,000 in 1997. The proportion of children without insurance also rose, to 15.4 percent in 1998, from 15 percent in 1997.
The increase was most notable among poor children under the age of 6. The proportion of such children without insurance climbed to 23.6 percent last year, from 20.1 percent in 1997, the bureau said.
Cuts in the Medicaid rolls appear to be one reason for the increase. The number of people with Medicaid coverage dropped by 1.1 million last year, to 27.9 million, after falling by 2.5 million in 1997, the Census Bureau said.
Jennifer A. Campbell, the main author of the Census Bureau report, said, "Medicaid was the most widespread type of coverage among the poor, with 40.6 percent of all poor people covered by Medicaid at some time" in 1998.
"This percentage is down significantly from the previous year, when 43.3 percent of poor people were covered by Medicaid," Ms. Campbell said.
Most poor children are eligible for Medicaid. But the number of poor children with such coverage declined by 766,000 last year, to 7.8 million, after falling by 501,000 in 1997, the bureau said.
Administration officials say they believe that some recipients of Medicaid do not realize they have coverage and did not report it when interviewed by the Census Bureau.
Overall, poverty declined and incomes rose last year. (A family of four was considered poor if it had an income of less than $16,660.) But nearly one-third of poor people, 11.2 million of the 34.5 million in poverty, had no health insurance, the Government said.
About 5.6 million people worked full-time last year and were still poor. About half of them -- 2.7 million, or 47.5 percent -- had no health insurance.
Among various racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic Americans were the least likely to have health insurance. The Census Bureau said 35.3 percent of Hispanic residents were uninsured, compared with 22.2 percent of blacks, 21.1 percent of Asian-Americans and 11.9 percent of non-Hispanic whites.
More than seven million of the people without health insurance are not United States citizens, the report said. Nearly 43 percent of the 16.6 million noncitizens are uninsured.
Using the average for 1997 and 1998, the Census Bureau reported that 24.5 percent of Texas residents were uninsured, the largest proportion for any state. Hawaii, with 8.8 percent, had the smallest proportion.
Arizona also had a high rate, with 24.3 percent of its people uninsured, while the proportion without coverage was small in Minnesota (9.2 percent) and Wisconsin (9.9 percent).
The proportion without health insurance was well below the national average in Connecticut, where 12.3 percent were uninsured.
The figures were slightly above the national average in New York (17.4 percent) and New Jersey (16.5 percent).

Austria Elections Inconclusive
The far-right Freedom Party headed by the controversial Jorg Haider did not, as analysts had expected, end up firmly in a position in which it could negotiate a share of coalition rule in national elections in Austria. The party finished in a virtual tie for second place with the conservative People's Party and the outcome will be decided by absentee ballots that should be counted by Thursday. A10
 
Disappearances in Belarus
Four people linked to the opposition in Belarus have vanished since April. The disappearances coincide with the most concerted campaign yet by Belarus's pro-democracy movement to press the Government for reforms. There is little evidence to indicate who might be responsible for the disappearances, but opponents and many Westerners insist the Government is behind them, while that Government denies it. A10

HEADLINE: In America;
The New Al Gore

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Al Gore dropped by a few days ago and insisted he's a changed man.
"I'm in a completely different place as far as this campaign is concerned," he said. He said he felt liberated. "I couldn't care less what the pollsters and consultants say about the issues, the strategy. I'm just going to do my dead level best to speak and act directly from my heart and rely on my instincts and let the chips fall where they may." 
 He quoted Janis Joplin: "Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose."
I was amazed. Was this Al Gore?
One of the raps against the Vice President is that he comes across as inauthentic, too programmed. So the question is whether he means it when he says he plans to campaign from the heart, or whether this is just another makeover crafted by the very consultants he says he's going to ignore.
If he's serious, he might have a shot at saving his campaign. Harry Truman, who was short of funds, terrible at giving speeches and disdained by many in his own party, won in 1948 by taking a ferociously honest message straight to the people.
Among other things, Truman said, "If you send another Republican Congress to Washington, you're a bigger bunch of suckers than I think you are."
When I asked Mr. Gore why he would be a better President than George W. Bush, he replied: "I fight for working families; he doesn't. His philosophy relies on attention to those who hold the levers of power and have the bulk of the resources, and is based on the theory that if they are well attended to, then those decisions will have a beneficial impact on the rest of the country."
He said there might be some hyperbole in that statement, but not much. It was an affront to common sense, he said, "to recommend a return to the economic policies of the Reagan-Bush years that created devastation for low- and middle-income working families."
Mr. Gore went on to speak emphatically, even passionately, about the state of the public schools and his opposition to school vouchers:
"Ninety percent of the children are in public schools. The teachers are overburdened. The classrooms are overcrowded. The buildings are falling down.
"The reform agenda is underfunded and the percentage of the voting population made up of parents of school-age children, always a mainstay for supporting bond issues for education, is the smallest percentage it has ever been in history because of the aging of our population. In a situation like that, to call for draining away money from public schools toward private schools is just plain irresponsible in my opinion."
Al Gore has the issues that should trump Mr. Bush and the experience that should check Bill Bradley. And yet he is struggling against both.
There are moments every now and then when you catch a glimpse of the spontaneity and conviction the voters would like to see in him. One night last week a woman called in to Larry King's show on CNN and asked Mr. Gore if, knowing what he knows today, he still would have run with Bill Clinton.
The Vice President didn't hesitate. "Yes, I would," he said, "because if you look at the difference that's been made for this country in the last six and a half years -- instead of a triple-dip recession, we now have 20 million new jobs. We have higher incomes, the lowest African-American and Latino unemployment rates in history. The stock market has tripled instead of the debt quadrupling, as it did in the Reagan-Bush years. The crime rates are lower. There are more families moving off welfare and into the work force. Families are stronger. Teen pregnancies are down. Abortions are down. The quality of life is up. We are a better country because of the differences that this Administration has helped to bring about in the last six and a half years."
The public will vote thumbs up or thumbs down on Mr. Gore's campaign for the Presidency. The question is whether the Vice President will give himself a fair chance, whether he'll allow the voters to see the authentic Al Gore, the real man behind the cardboard candidate. That seems extremely difficult for him, but he says he will. He says he's been liberated.

HEADLINE: Mosquito Virus Exposes a Hole in the Safety Net

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
It may have come in the blood of a traveler returning from Africa or Europe. It may have hitchhiked in an infected bird smuggled in baggage. There is even a slight chance that it came in the gut of a mosquito that flitted into a jet.
But as medical sleuths try to trace the path of the West Nile-like virus that has helicopters fumigating New York City and its suburbs, they are also confronting a much larger problem. 
 This virus, which has killed four people and scores of birds, is just one of dozens of hazards to people, crops, livestock, and wildlife that -- after being hemmed in by oceans for millenniums -- are increasingly free to hopscotch the world because of the acceleration and growth of international travel and trade.
The threat is greatest in the country's biggest hubs of global commerce: New York City, Los Angeles and Miami.
"We've gotten over being surprised," said Dr. James Hughes, the director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases at the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is promoting a new plan to improve surveillance and responses when an outbreak occurs. "We're making some progress, and it's a good thing," Dr. Hughes said, "because the microbes are certainly out there."
Medical and agricultural inspectors and experts are working around the clock to spot new threats. But the West Nile-like virus proves that the safety net is, at best, incomplete.
Some of the enemies are invisible microbes; others are as conspicuous as the freight-hopping, tree-drilling, two-inch Asian long-horned beetle, a threat to hardwood forests. The beetle made its North American debut in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 1996 and has since appeared in Chicago and, most recently, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just blocks from the greenery of Central Park. The beetle probably arrived in the 1980's in wooden shipping pallets, said Henry J. Stern, the City Commissioner of Parks and Recreation.
Mr. Stern said the beetle and now the virus show that nature is still capable of throwing surprises at the world's dominant species.
"In the modern age, this mechanical age, we think we've conquered the planet," he said. "But we're not quite the masters of the universe we think we are."
Improvements in transportation have always been followed by movements of harmful species, said William H. McNeill, the author of the book "Plagues and Peoples," which he updated last year. Smallpox accompanied seagoing European settlers to the Americas. But potato blight did not move from the Americas to Europe until the mid-1800's, when the advent of swifter ships allowed potatoes to arrive fresh, with the harmful mold healthy and alive.
At the end of the 20th century, the explosive growth in airplane traffic has amplified the problem. The number of international passenger and cargo flights to and from airports serving New York City doubled just from 1987 to 1997, to 187,785 from 93,008, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The flow of goods and travelers can only be spot-checked by inspectors seeking threats. Screening for imported diseases is nearly impossible because West Nile and many other dangerous ailments often are carried without symptoms for days or weeks.
The effort to monitor and sequester sick passengers has shrunk substantially in recent decades; the number of Federal quarantine stations at airports dropped from 55 in 1967 to 8 today, Federal health officials said. One of the eight is at Kennedy International Airport.
The only really effective way to track imported infections is to communicate well with hospitals and doctors, local health officials said.
"Having one inspector for every person coming in would not prevent disease from coming in," said Dr. Marcelle C. Layton, the assistant commissioner for communicable diseases of the New York City Health Department. So when some new threat is identified, the only recourse is often to wait for cases to start popping up at city hospitals, city health officials say.
A swift response is then essential, she said, explaining that New York City, with 24,000 people per square mile, is twice as crowded as the country's second most densely populated city, Chicago.
In a parallel effort, teams of inspectors are also on the lookout for agricultural pests or diseases. Some of the dogs sniffing bags at airport terminals are looking not for drugs or bombs, but for oranges that might carry imported fruit flies; for giant African snails that are a delicacy to some, but to agriculture officials are a potential scourge, and for sausage, which has been occasionally found sewn into coat linings of epicures, and which can harbor mad cow disease or hog cholera.
Occasionally, officials are amazed by what they find. Beagles at Kennedy recently sniffed out a partly stuffed cow head arriving from Argentina. Just last week, someone brought two bucketloads of live Vietnamese apple snails, which are voracious rice pests, into Los Angeles International Airport, said Joseph Cavey, a biologist with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a branch of the Federal Agriculture Department that monitors imported hazards.
"There was a woman once who was hiding her pet parrot under her dress," Mr. Cavey said. "You could see it moving."
But any amusement fades with the knowledge that it is this kind of bird that could carry a disease like West Nile, which has so far killed four people, sickened dozens of others, prompted widespread pesticide spraying, and felled scores of crows and other birds in and around New York City.
There is a small chance that the West Nile-like virus -- like hantavirus, another recent discovery -- has been in this country for years and is only now being noticed because of the deadly outbreak that began in New York City at the end of the summer. But medical experts investigating the mystery say evidence so far indicates that it is most likely a new arrival, spreading from an epicenter in Queens near the Whitestone Bridge.
Federal health officials said that the virus is essentially identical to West Nile, but they will not officially call it West Nile until genetic decoding is completed.
One new case of the virus was reported yesterday in New York City, raising the total to 37 confirmed cases, the city's Health Department said. In the latest case, an 81-year-old woman from Flushing, Queens, was treated for the symptoms at a hospital and released.
The intensive medical investigations prompted by outbreaks like the current one sometimes reveal other potential threats that lurk continuously but rarely surface.
In September 1994, as pneumonic plague swept Surat, a city on the west coast of India, health officials in New York City girded for possible battle, hoping to prevent the disease from being introduced by infected travelers.
Faxes and alerts went out to the city's 70 hospitals and the airports. No plague was found, but the effort was not a waste of time, said Dr. Layton, with the city Health Department.
The extra surveillance identified cases of typhoid fever, malaria and possibly dengue fever, all of which are potentially deadly imported illnesses -- and all of which most likely would never have been noticed. "When you look more closely," Dr. Layton said, "when you get down on your hands and knees and clean your kitchen, you're going to find things you don't normally find."
Once a new pest or disease makes a landing, the consequences can be dire, and expensive.
In the early 1970's, agriculture officials say, Newcastle disease, probably carried by parrots imported from South America, attacked poultry and other birds in southern California. Nearly 12 million chickens and other birds had to be killed. The eradication effort and the losses amounted to $56 million.
Zebra mussels, brought from Eastern Europe to eastern North America in ballast water in ships in the 1980's, have caused $5 billion in damage to pipes and pumps, mainly in the Great Lakes. Federal scientists are now trying to prevent them from crossing the continental divide.
In a study scheduled to be published in the December issue of Bioscience, a scientific journal, Dr. David Pimentel, an ecologist and entomologist at Cornell University, estimates that the annual cost of dealing with imported species of plants, animals, and diseases is $138 billion, including crop losses and the cost of eradication efforts.
The damage goes beyond economics, Dr. Pimentel said. "Forty-two percent of endangered and threatened species are on the list because of invasive species," he said.
And then, of course, there is the loss of life when a new virus or other infectious agent arrives on a shore where people and animals have no resistance.
Some symptoms seen in the New York City residents stricken with encephalitis from the West Nile-like virus are very different from those known from the disease in its home range in northern Africa -- and in many cases the symptoms are more severe, Dr. Layton said.
Many of the patients experienced extreme muscle weakness, a symptom never previously reported from this virus, she said.
"When a virus gets to a new part of the world, it's hard to know how it will behave in animals and humans," Dr. Layton said.
One fact troubling those involved in watching for incoming diseases is that it is impossible to test for everything.
Dr. K. N. Ahmad, who is the Department of Agriculture's port veterinarian for New York City, said that all legally imported birds are tested for Newcastle disease and avian influenza, another infection that can devastate poultry.
Birds are then kept in a 30-day quarantine, some in the Bronx and some in Newburgh, in Orange County, N.Y., to watch for signs of illness. But they are not routinely tested for encephalitis viruses, and certainly not for West Nile, he said.
Legal bird imports through New York City have dropped nearly to nil in recent years, he said, because of new Federal and international bans on dealing in rare tropical species.
But smuggling still persists, he said.
And imports of other potential disease hosts are on the rise.
Seven days a week, Dr. Ahmad said, he or his team greets shipments of high-priced horses from around the world, a trade that is thriving along with the American economy. Last Thursday night, he headed from his office at Kennedy Airport to check 13 horses arriving in a Cargolux jet from Iceland.
Dr. Ahmad drew blood samples that were sent to a Federal laboratory in Ames, Iowa, on the next United Airlines flight. Then the horses were driven in sealed trucks to Newburgh, to wait in quarantine for three days for the test results.
The samples are checked for signs of exposure to four deadly contagious equine diseases that do not exist in the United States. One of them, called glanders, causes ulcers throughout the lymphatic system and can be spread to humans, he said.
"It is very rare and has not been seen here in 50 or 60 years, but we do get animals that test positive, meaning they were exposed," Dr. Ahmad said. Such animals are sent back or destroyed. This shipment, at least, passed the test, and soon the horses were headed to their new owners in Maine, Vermont, upstate New York, and Arkansas, Dr. Ahmad said.
But more horses, birds and travelers are coming every day, he said, adding, "It never stops."

Support for Sellers In Electronic Auctions

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
Andale Inc. wants to take the fleas out of the electronic flea market. The start-up E-commerce company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., plans to unveil a new service this week that provides back-office support for people who make their living selling goods on electronic auctions.
Andale will provide all the necessary administrative support for such merchants, like establishing listings, answering customer E-mail and sending out merchandise to buyers. The service is intended for power sellers, the tens of thousands of people who make their livings -- as well as huge profits, in some cases -- auctioning large quantities of everything from antiques and baseball cards to costume jewelry and electronics. 
 Munjal Shah, the founder and chief executive of Andale, said that for these entrepreneurs, managing an electronic auction business can be a cumbersome process, mostly because auction sites are not set up to handle the growing businesses that have popped up. "Most people don't realize that the vast majority of transactions on sites like Ebay are done by just a small percentage of registered users," said Mr. Shah, a former marketing executive at the software maker Baan. "Yet auction sites are designed for the casual user."
According to a report issued earlier this year by Forrester Research, spending on auction sites will grow from $1 billion in 1998 to an estimated $2.3 billion this year and to $6.4 billion by 2003. The great majority of the goods will be sold by people who have set up businesses by selling at auctions, rather than by individual consumers selling collectibles from their attics. Andale generates revenues by taking a small percentage of every transaction.
Founded in April, Andale has already raised $19.6 million from Accel Partners and several other Silicon Valley venture capital firms and plans to begin its service in November.

HEADLINE: Will Dam-Busting Save Salmon? Maybe Not

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash.

 BODY:
The big hydroelectric dam sits deep in a valley framed by softly rounded, grass-covered mountains that look from a distance as if they have been sanded down and then covered with beige and blond velvet. Great expanses of sun-dappled blue water, more reservoir or lake than river, stretch above and below the concrete-and-earth barrier. That is part of the problem.
The once fast-flowing Snake River is now so slow, and Lower Granite Dam so much of an impediment, that salmon -- totem fish of the Pacific Northwest and the focus of a landmark political, economic and environmental struggle -- cannot migrate up and down the Snake without the help of an elaborate man-made Rube Goldberg-like system. 
 So it was on a recent day as a state fisheries biologist, Fred Mensik, plucked a silvery, six-inch fish from water speeding through a trough.
"Chinook," Mr. Mensik said, identifying it as a member of the heftiest of the salmon species. If it lives long enough, the juvenile smolt, as it is called, could grow to 3 or 4 feet and 40 pounds or more. Mr. Mensik measured the fish, entered the information into a laptop computer and returned the fish to the trough, where it joined other smolts and migrating young steelhead (sea-run rainbow trout) on their way to a tank truck parked outside.
The truck would transport the juvenile fish nearly 250 miles downriver, past seven other dams in the Columbia River system, of which the Snake is a part. There the fish were released to resume a trip to the Pacific Ocean.
While Mr. Mensik and his co-workers were shepherding the fish downstream, adult salmon and steelhead -- big, powerful veterans of years at sea -- were climbing a fish ladder a few feet away, heading upstream to spawn and die. But there are so few going upstream that all these fish, along with all other salmon and steelhead that spawn in the Snake River, are listed as imperiled under the Endangered Species Act.
Will the elaborate, two-decade-old system for moving fish around the dams prove inadequate to save the salmon? The question is at the heart of a tense debate over whether to continue to rely on the transportation system or junk it and remove the earthen portions of Lower Granite and three other hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake.
Breaching those dams would help restore the natural flow along a 140-mile stretch of the river, and many scientists say it would be the single most effective remedy for the salmon's plight. The concrete portions of the dams, their humming turbines silenced, would become relics, abandoned monuments to a time when the only consideration was to conquer and harness nature, and to the dawn of an era in which coexisting with nature has been made a priority.
A decision on the dams, driven by a Federal lawsuit brought by environmentalists, is expected by early next year. If the Clinton Administration proposes breaching the dams, the issue would then go to Congress, which must appropriate the money.
Few if any conservation problems match this one for scale and complexity, or for its many connections with the modern economy. "The salmon involves our whole way of doing things," said Dr. Peter M. Kareiva, an ecologist who is directing a scientific assessment of the problem for the National Marine Fisheries Service. "There is no simple, easily defined enemy."
Many scientists and environmentalists say the question of whether to breach the dams is a no-brainer. They argue that the population of the Snake River salmon began to decline after the dams were built in the 1960's and 1970's, and that while the system for trucking and barging fish downstream and helping adults back up may have helped, it is inadequate.
"Prior to completion of the lower Snake River dams, Snake River stocks did as well or better than their downriver counterparts," said Ed Bowles, a scientist who is the salmon and steelhead recovery manager for the state of Idaho, which contains the Snake's watershed upstream of the four dams. "Since completion of the dams, we have every year done much worse."
But other scientists, particularly those of the marine fisheries service, say the situation is more complicated. The service's studies, which are being reviewed by an independent panel, suggest that while breaching the dams may be necessary to save some salmon stocks, it will not be enough. The wild salmon population has also been hurt by the destruction and degradation of spawning areas, overfishing and the introduction of hatchery-bred salmon and trout, according to the analysis. (Only about 20 percent of Snake River salmon today are the progeny of wild fish.)
Unless these problems are resolved, the analysis suggested, the wild salmon and trout will probably continue to decline, even if the dams are breached.
Breaching "is not going to be a silver bullet," said Dr. Michelle McClure, a biologist with the fisheries service who is helping to conduct the Federal analysis.
Moreover, said the fisheries service, which will draft the scientific opinion on which the decision about the dams will be based, the latest evidence suggests that trucking and barging young fish is more effective than was previously thought. Whether that is true should become clear in 5 or 10 years, scientists with the fisheries service said. One option, they said, would be to wait.
But other experts, including Mr. Bowles, said the answer was as apparent now as it would ever be. The fisheries service said any delay would increase the likelihood that some stocks of Snake River salmon would become extinct.
Pacific salmon are different from Atlantic salmon in that there are several species, and that different populations spawn at different times. Moreover, they spawn only once and then die (Atlantic salmon, and steelhead, can return to the ocean and spawn again, several times).
Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks, a group of fish that spawn in the same locality, like a specific creek.
Individual stocks are important because each diverges genetically from other stocks as they reproduce. Such divergence is the touchstone of evolutionary adaptation, and so individual stocks are protected by the Endangered Species Act.
For many stocks of Snake River salmon, the marine fisheries service has found that the risk of extinction is considerable, sometimes even in the short term. For instance, surveys of a chinook stock that spawns in a spring in Marsh Creek, a beautiful alpine meadow stream in the Frank Church Wilderness of Idaho, found no spawners last spring or in the spring of 1995.
The studies by the fisheries service indicated that the Marsh Creek salmon had at least a 1-in-10 chance of virtual extinction (only one spawner a year) in the next decade, and that many stocks of chinook that spawned in the spring and summer had a 1-in-2 chance of extinction in the next century. The risk that all Snake River runs of spring and summer chinook will be extinct in 100 years was calculated at about 50 percent.
Other runs of chinook spawn in the fall, and their risk of extinction in the next century was calculated at 27 percent; for steelhead, even though their numbers are relatively robust, the risk was 93 percent. A fourth species, the Snake River sockeye salmon, is already close to extinction: only seven returned to their Idaho spawning grounds this year.
The Columbia-Snake system was once one of the most fecund salmon producers in the world, with the Snake drainage giving birth to about half of all salmon in that system. But the dams, overfishing, destruction of spawning areas and the competition with hatchery fish cut severely into their numbers. Generally, the depletion has been worse the farther south one goes; salmon are not imperiled in Alaska, for example.
Some Columbia basin populations, ones whose passage was completely blocked by dams, have long since become extinct. But on other stretches, like the lower Snake, the Army Corps of Engineers has engaged in a long, expensive effort to make the passage as easy as possible so that more fish will survive. The result has been the substitution, at a cost of more than $3 billion, of an artificial system for the natural one.
At Lower Granite Dam, for instance, juvenile fish coming downstream are diverted into an elaborate bypass system and then into either tank trucks or barges.
Most of the juvenile fish are alive when released below Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, but an argument rages about whether many of them later die from the stress of transportation. Proponents of breaching the Snake dams argue that fish hatched below the dams show higher survival rates than do those hatched above and transported downstream.
But the fisheries service said new studies involving fish tracked with tiny radio transmitters suggested that there was no significant increase in mortality associated with barging and trucking. Other scientists counter that the sample is too small to draw conclusions.
And some environmentalists and scientists said that barging and trucking did nothing for adult fish, some of which fail to find the entrances to fish ladders or are too exhausted to spawn once they run the gantlet of the dams.
What is the bottom line?
The Federal computer simulations show that breaching the dams would increase the growth of spring and summer chinook by about 5 percent. But, Dr. McClure said, a 12 percent improvement would be necessary to avoid extinction.
If policy makers want to eliminate as much risk as possible, then dam breaching should be pursued along with other actions like a moratorium on fishing and improvements in other areas, such as increasing the quality of habitat, the fisheries service said.
Alternatively, the service said, policy makers might want to accept the possible extinction of the Marsh Creek stock and explore whether alternatives to dam breaching might work. Even if the dams are removed -- which will also affect navigation, reduce a source of cheap electricity and, some politicians say, ruin the region's economy -- the actual breaching will take six or seven years, the Corps of Engineers says.
For fall chinook, virtually everyone agrees, dam breaching would be a boon. That is because they spawn not in tributary streams but in the main branches of the Snake and the Columbia. With the dams and their reservoirs in place, most of the water is too deep for spawning. But by breaching the four lower Snake dams, the habitat for fall chinook would increase nearly 80 percent.
On the other hand, Dr. Kareiva said, it may be that fall chinook and steelhead could be rescued by some means short of dam breaching, like stricter curbs on fishing.
A group of Federal agencies, including the fisheries service and Corps of Engineers, is developing options for salmon recovery that would take into account a range of threats to the salmon life cycle. The agencies' reports are due by the end of the year, after which there will be public hearings. The agencies hope to settle on a recommendation by next spring.
Then the fate of the salmon will move more squarely into the realm of politics and economics. In the end, the decision will probably boil down to how important Americans think it is to save the salmon.

Dams in the lower Snake and Columbia Rivers interrupt the natural migrations of Pacific salmon and are believed to be a major factor in their declining numbers. Officials are considering alternatives to the present system for routing the fish around the dams.
 
Downstream
THE YOUNG GO TO SEA
 
SPILLWAYS
Some juvenile fish bypass the dams through spillways built into the dams. One concern is that the large volume of water spilling through these gates can produce excessive amounts of gases harmful to the fish.
 
TURBINES
Others go through turbines, where the high pressure and whirring blades kill up to 10 percent of the fish. Some of those that make it through end up disoriented and vulnerable to predators.
 
BYPASS SYSTEM ...
Large screens prevent the fish from being drawn into the turbine intakes and direct them upward into a bypass channel. Some fish re-enter the river on the downstream side of the dam.
 
At some dams, fish are transferred to barges or trucks that transport them past the Bonneville Dam, the last dam interrupting their migration to sea waters.
 
Upstream
THE ADULTS' RETURN TRIP
 
Adult fish swimming upstream to spawn pass the dams through an artificial set of rapids and pools constructed of concrete. About 95 percent complete the journey, but how many live to reproduce is in dispute.

Mixed Signals From Japan On Economy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
In a mixed signal about Japan's prospects for economic recovery, the nation's central bank reported a steep rise in business confidence today but a drop in business investment plans.
The Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly survey showed the biggest gain in confidence among large manufacturers since November 1987. The findings surpassed analysts' expectations. 
 The survey, known as the tankan, measures the percentage of firms seeing business conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen, and is considered a sensitive barometer of Japan's economic health.
The Japanese Government was cautious in its assessment of the tankan results. Hiromu Nonaka, the chief spokesman, said at a regular news briefing here that the survey showed the worst was over for Japan's economy but that the overall assessment still indicated severe conditions.
Despite the greater confidence, the pessimists still exceeded the optimists in the survey of 9,275 companies, which was conducted in September. It also showed that business investment continues to taper off in Japan, and for large corporations has weakened to the lowest level since September 1983.
The release of the survey came against a backdrop of strong economic news in Japan. The Government has reported two consecutive quarters of growth, however modest, and a drop in the unemployment rate from a postwar high.
Some analysts said the results of the tankan survey reinforced their view that Japan was still in a deep struggle to emerge from its deepest recession in a half-century.
"The tankan numbers show an improvement that exceeds expectations," said Yoshio Shukuwa, a market economist at Sanwa Securities, "but I'm skeptical that this can continue. There are still worries about this economic recovery."
Stocks received a slight lift from the report. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 51.15 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to close at 17,763.71. The yen gave up early gains against the dollar on news of the drop in business investment. In late trading here, the dollar sold at 106.11 yen. Later in New York, the dollar strengthened a little further to 106.23.
Although marginally weaker, the yen remains near its highest levels in more than three years. Japanese authorities fear that if the yen gains too much, economic recovery will be endangered because a strong currency hurts the competitiveness of exports.
The Group of Seven industrial nations, meeting late last month in Washington, expressed concern about the yen's strength in a statement viewed in foreign-exchange markets as a sign that Japan and its partners might take more aggressive coordinated action to contain the yen's rise But there has been no evidence so far that they have done so.

HEADLINE: Foundations Can Give More, And Protect Assets, Study Says

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Charitable foundations could give away 60 percent more money than they do now without eroding the total value of their assets, a study for a group of progressive foundations has found.
The study, by Prof. Perry Mehrling, chairman of the Barnard College economics department, found that so many wealthy Americans are establishing foundations that new gifts to these endowments are now greater than the grants they make. This trend, with investment income, means that foundation assets are growing much faster than grants to nonprofit organizations at a time when Congress has reduced funding for programs operated by charities. 
 Professor Mehrling's study is to be released today by the National Network of Grantmakers, an organization of progressive foundations, which recently began a campaign to persuade all foundations to increase their grant making by 20 percent, to 6 percent of assets from 5 percent. Professor Mehrling's study said giving could actually rise to 8 percent, a 60 percent increase, without reducing the value of foundation assets.
The network's proposed one percentage point increase in giving would mean $4 billion more this year for nonprofit organizations if it was adopted by all 49,000 charitable endowments that make grants.
Lester Salamon, a Johns Hopkins University expert on nonprofit finance who has studied how Federal budget cuts affect nonprofit organizations, has estimated that in the five years ending in 2002 these cuts will total more than $100 billion.
Congress set the minimum foundation payout at 5 percent of assets in 1981, repealing a rule that had required foundations to give away all of their investment income or 5 percent of their assets, whichever was greater. Foundations contended that the old rule, in effect during an era of high inflation, made foundation assets shrink in real terms.
The grant makers' campaign, called "One Percent More for Democracy," is being led by Diane V. Feeney of San Francisco, the daughter of Charles Feeney, who anonymously gave away most of his fortune, about $640 million, to his foundation starting in 1982. He revealed the gifts in 1997.
Ms. Feeney is president of her own family endowment, the French American Charitable Trust, which has assets of $43 million, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
She said that although the campaign was focused on getting more money for progressive nonprofit organizations, she encouraged all foundations to increase their payouts.
Adjusted for inflation, foundations give away 3.6 times as much today as in 1982, the first year the 5 percent rule was in effect, but their assets have grown to 5.6 times as much.
Foundation assets totaled $330 billion at the end of 1997, the latest year for which the Foundation Center, a research organization, has released data. Grants totaled just under $16 billion, or 4.8 percent of assets.
Based on historic growth patterns and major gifts announced since then, foundation assets should now total more than $400 billion.
The Council on Foundations, the largest organization of charitable endowments, said studies in 1991 and 1995 showed that 5 percent was the optimal payout if foundation assets were to grow with inflation.
John Edie, the council's general counsel, said that over a half-century the 5 percent payout would let foundation assets grow about one-half of 1 percent a year above inflation.
Professor Mehrling said the 5 percent payout was imposed "not to keep foundations from paying out too much, but to keep them from paying out too little."
Foundations that restrict payouts to 5 percent to increase the amount of assets under their management, Professor Mehrling said, "defeat the real social purpose of their privileged tax status and risk attracting renewed legislative attention."

HEADLINE: This Splintered Isle;
Economically, There Have Always Been Two Englands

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
When the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, traveled to New York last month to extol his own stewardship of the British economy, he was in an ebullient mood, and the figures did nothing to darken his day.
With almost metronomic regularity, Britain has been setting records: inflation, by one yardstick, is at its lowest level in 36 years; unemployment has been tamed to levels last seen in the 1980's, and the budget is expected to zoom from a projected deficit of $7.4 billion to a surplus of $19.8 billion -- a war chest any political leader would covet. 
 But those numbers do not give the whole picture. For Britain cannot shake its chronic problem: an economy perilously skewed between an ailing industrial North and a prosperous South dominated by greater London. While Britain as a whole is creating jobs, said a former Trade Minister, Peter Mandelson, "on almost every other economic measure, the North-South gap is growing -- in income, average wages and migration, it is widening."
And, he said, those distinctions "will do great damage to the U.K. economy if not arrested."
Indeed, many of the disparities between the South and the North, particularly the four English counties clustered just below the Scottish border, are also seen to varying degrees when South England is compared with many areas of Scotland or Wales.
Of course, the divide between North and South in England is woven into British history, from the days cloth-capped coal miners symbolized the industrial Midlands and Northern reaches and bowler-hatted city gentlemen were the emblem of southern prosperity. But, more recently, these two regions have come to provide the geographic overlay of a contest between ailing manufacturing and booming services, a conflict sharpened by broader economic policy.
The currency, for instance, remains far too strong for the liking of exporters. Most of all, the fiscal discipline that Mr. Brown praised so highly as the guarantor of noninflationary growth -- on the United States model -- has itself begun to push up interest rates. And this, in turn, undermines any talk of Britain's converging with the 11 European economies bound together by a single currency, the euro. In those nations, the official short-term interest rate hovers around 2.5 percent, or less than half Britain's current level of 5.25 percent.
Britain, in other words, is a tale of two economic visions, as conversations with different business executives clearly show.
Take David Moody, whose family has been building oceangoing yachts for some 200 years. A year ago, he said, when economists were forecasting low growth -- or even recession -- for the British economy, his sales were down and he reduced the staff at his shipyard in Southampton, on England's southern coast, some 15 percent.
This year, though, interest rates initially fell sharply, and economic growth is now predicted to hit at least 2.6 percent next year. In this climate, his sales have doubled, to some $4.8 million, mainly to professional people from the greater London area, he said, many of them paying cash for sailboats costing from $110,000 to $610,000. "There seems to be an awful lot more confidence in the market," he said.
Andrew Cook has a different view, shaped not just by economics but also by geography. Mr. Cook is chairman of Europe's biggest producer of steel castings, William Cook Group, which is nearly 100 years old. While Mr. Moody's business provides a barometer of the service-driven prosperity of the South, Mr. Cook's hails from Sheffield, in the gritty area well north of London, where the shrinkage of manufacturing to only 20 percent of the economic output of post-industrial Britain has cast a pall.
Last year, as the benchmark interest rate began to tumble from a high of 7.5 percent, falling to 5 percent before rates began to rise again this month, manufacturers who had been watching order books shrink and work forces dwindle began to sense a recovery. Before that revival could take root, however, the Bank of England, moving to contain inflation, raised rates to 5.25 percent, strengthening the pound and stunning manufacturers. And that sharpened the fundamental quandary that Britain's regional imbalances present to economic planners.
"A lot of policy making is done by people who seem to regard London as the barometer of the U.K. economy as a whole," Mr. Cook said. "But London is not representative of the U.K. economy -- less so now than ever before."
That view is shared by John Edmunds, general manager of Ingersoll Dresser Pumps in Gateshead in the Northeast, which is heavily dependent on the oil industry. "When interest rates go up and the pound goes up, we are not competitive," he said. "And this is a very competitive business. We are all scratching around to get this work. If rates go up and the pound strengthens, we lose big orders."
The rate increase was largely ascribed to factors like runaway house prices in the wealthy Southeast, where the cost of a home has soared 20 percent in some areas in the last year. That threatened to push inflation, now at 2.2 percent, beyond the bank's target of 2.5 percent. And the fiscal discipline that prompted the increase reflected Britain's deep-rooted -- and historically vindicated -- phobia that any boom sooner or later leads to a bust.
But its impact outside the South was seen by people like Mr. Cook and Mr. Edmunds as damaging a nascent recovery. For one thing, it made borrowing more expensive. It contributed to the factors that have kept the pound strong against the euro. And that, in turn, perpetuated the basic enigma facing British manufacturers: a strong pound makes exports more expensive for foreign buyers, while cheap imports erode the domestic market.
"Our domestic market has been destroyed, and our export market, which we depend on, will suffer," Mr. Cook said. "There is no fat left on the bone of British industry."
The economic logic of higher interest rates, though, is unavoidable. "The South accounts for well over 60 percent of G.D.P.," said Ian Stewart, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company. "It's inevitable that monetary policy is going to be based on that part of the country, just as in Euroland it's dictated by conditions in Germany, France and Italy."
In other words, growth in what Mr. Cook terms the hothouse around London is, to some extent, being paid for in higher interest rates by people who cannot afford them in the struggling Northeast.
Britain is not the only European country with sharp regional differences. Unemployment in eastern Germany is twice that in western Germany. Southern Italy lags far behind the North. Even within Britain's regions, there are sharp differences. "The picture is a bit more complex than the headlines make out," Mr. Stewart, the economist, said. "Within supposedly affluent areas, there are pockets of deprivation and poverty. And London is a good example of that."
Nor do the rosy unemployment figures tell the full story. As in the United States after the industrial layoffs of the 1980's and wider downsizings of the early 1990's, many Britons have been forced to redefine the notion of work in an era of global competition. The crumbling of the welfare state and the collapse of labor union power have gnawed at traditional safety nets, like job security.
Britain, said Steve Fleetwood, a lecturer at Lancaster University School of Management, "is not so much solving the problem of unemployment as transforming it into a different one: the problem of poor-quality employment."
The drive for greater labor flexibility, he said, had confronted many workers with a "Hobson's choice: workers can either have an insecure, stressful, badly paid job, or no job at all."
Yet even by the broadest definition of a North-South divide, the shadings are far grayer than history's memories of hunger marchers from the northeastern town of Jarrow trudging south to protest their plight in London in the 1930's.
Because of government incentives, foreign investment in Britain, totaling a cumulative $320 billion, has revitalized depressed industries and regions. Nissan's main British car plant, for instance, is in the Northeast, near the political home base of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Before it withdrew last year, citing the world semiconductor glut, Siemens of Germany had a major plant in Tyneside, almost at the gates of Jarrow itself.
Yet as the Siemens example showed, foreign investment has two very sharp edges. "We have had a lot of companies coming into the Northeast, but when anything goes wrong in their home market, they pull out and everything goes down the tubes," said Mr. Edmunds of Ingersoll Dresser Pumps.
And other, sharp distinctions remain. Driven by a booming services industry, retail prices in London have by some estimates been rising a full percentage point faster than the 1.4 percent national average. House prices in London -- a particularly emotive yardstick for Britons -- have far outstripped those in the rest of the country. Even before this year's increases, one research organization found that Londoners typically spent $11,300 a year on housing, 55 percent more than the countrywide average.
The unemployment numbers reflect the trend, too. The national average is just 5.9 percent. In greater London, it is only 4.9 percent, and the Southeast over all is even lower at 3.8 percent. In the far North, by contrast, unemployment is 7.1 percent.
That disparity, in turn, plays out in broader population figures. The population of London grew 4.3 percent the last seven years, according to the Office of National Statistics, while that of the Northeast stood still.
There may be finger-snapping growth in the Southeast, but in the Northeast, Mr. Edmunds said, "I don't see a boom."

HEADLINE: WORLD BRIEFING

BYLINE: Compiled Barth Healey

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: THE TORIES' PROGRAM -- The Conservative leader, William Hague, opened his party's annual convention with a 60-point proposal for a "common-sense revolution" that would reduce taxes, end benefits to welfare recipients who turn down work and increase parents' control of schools. He accused Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose Labor Party runs far ahead of the Tories in polls, of "breathtaking hypocrisy." Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
GERMANY: SUPPORT FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGES -- The Green Party, coalition partner in Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's center-left Government, is pressing ahead with a bill to recognize same-sex marriages. "The legal recognition of same-sex cohabitation will become a central focus of the parliamentary Greens' work," the party said. Victor Homola (NYT) 

UKRAINE: BOMB MAY WIN SYMPATHY VOTES -- A far-left candidate in the presidential race who was slightly wounded in a grenade attack on Saturday may now attract broader support. The candidate, Natalia Vitrenko, 47, is running neck-and-neck with President Leonid Kuchma. The vote is set for Oct. 31. (Reuters)
 
BELARUS: PUBLICATIONS CLOSED -- Nine publications, including several expressing opposition to President Aleksandr Lukashenko, were banned. Viktor Guretsky, director of media licensing, said the publications had opened offices without authorization. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ITALY, TURKEY: KURD GRANTED ASYLUM -- A court in Rome granted the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan political asylum. But Mr. Ocalan, who made the request in November, is now in a Turkish prison appealing a death sentence on terrorism charges. Bowing to intense pressure from Turkey and the United States, Italy asked Mr. Ocalan to leave last January, and the Turkish police later captured him in Nairobi. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
 
IRELAND: WEAPONS FOUND -- The Irish police made what they called a "very significant" discovery of explosives, guns, ammunition and a rocket launcher buried in a field near Dublin. The discovery came during a security operation aimed at forestalling violence by dissident republican guerrillas opposed to the Northern Ireland peace agreement. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
PHILIPPINES: MUSLIMS QUIT PEACE TALKS -- Muslim separatist guerrillas have pulled out of peace talks with the Government planned for later this month, accusing the army of attacking rebel camps. The talks, to end the 21-year war for a separate Muslim state in Mindanao, were to open on Oct. 25. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MALAYSIA: EX-MINISTER OUT OF HOSPITAL -- The former Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim was moved from the hospital where he spent three weeks for tests for arsenic poisoning back to Sungai Buloh prison, where he is serving a six-year term for corruption. Mr. Anwar, who is also standing trial on a sodomy charge, was taken to the hospital on Sept. 10 after saying he had been poisoned. His assertion, dismissed by the Government as a political ploy, set off the biggest anti-Government protests in nearly a year. The arsenic test results were ambiguous, Mr. Anwar's lawyer said. (Reuters)
 
AFGHANISTAN: REFUGEE CRISIS -- A human disaster threatens tens of thousands of Afghan refugees who have fled the civil war, a United Nations spokeswoman said in Islamabad, Pakistan. An estimated 80,000 to 85,000 refugees are living in mosques and schools or in the open in the opposition-held Panjshir valley, said the spokeswoman, Stephanie Bunker. About 200,000 villagers fled the fertile Shamali Plains, north of Kabul, after the Islamic Taliban militia began an offensive on July 28. (Agence France-Presse)
 
KASHMIR: TEAR GAS AT DEMONSTRATION -- Pakistani authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators demanding independence from India who were planning to march from Pakistan-held Kashmir into the Indian-held portion. The demonstrators, several of whom were injured, are with the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. India termed the planned march an "act of aggression" and warned it would open fire on any Kashmiris crossing the border. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
INDIA: PREMIER'S PLANS -- Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who is likely to serve again once the votes are counted Thursday in India's parliamentary elections, said in an interview with The Indian Express that his Government would restart talks with Pakistan, push through new measures to further integrate the Indian economy into the global marketplace and increase military spending. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
MALAYSIA: NEWSMAN TO BE FREED -- A Canadian journalist, Murray Hiebert, is to be released next week after serving one month in jail for contempt of court, said a prison official, Jamil Razif. The correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review was found guilty for writing an article on a suit filed by the wife of an Appeals Court judge against the International School of Kuala Lumpur for dropping her son from the debating team. (Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
COLOMBIA: KIDNAPPING BLOCKED -- Government troops thwarted a mass kidnapping by the People's Liberation Army, a small left-wing guerrilla group. The insurgents, who recently abducted a Roman Catholic bishop and a popular folk singer, seized at least 40 people, many of them college students, at a roadblock outside Ocana, in northern Colombia. But as the estimated 20 rebels were moving their captives to a mountain stronghold, they encountered an army unit, which killed at least one of the guerrillas and freed the prisoners. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
MEXICO: AN OPPOSITION VICTORY -- The candidate of Mexico's main leftist opposition party was elected mayor of Acapulco, the resort city in the Pacific coast state of Guerrero. The city, which has 700,000 residents, has always been governed by President Ernesto Zedillo's party, known as the PRI. In other local elections across Guerrero, however, the PRI won most of the races for mayor and for seats in the state legislature.
MEXICO CITY: FINAL TOLL IN QUAKE -- Officials put the final death toll from the earthquake that rattled Mexico on Sept. 30 at 27, including 25 people in the state of Oaxaca, site of the epicenter. The quake, which had a magnitude of 7.4, destroyed 23,000 homes in Oaxaca, Governor Jose Murat said. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
SOUTH AFRICA: CHARGES FROM APARTHEID ERA -- Dr. Wouter Basson, the head of chemical warfare under the former apartheid-era Government, appeared in court to face 67 criminal charges, from drug-dealing to fraud to conspiracy to murder. Dr. Basson is accused of injecting poison into prisoners and using Government laboratories to make the drug Ecstasy. The trial is expected to last two years. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: HIGHER OIL SALES -- The Security Council will allow Iraq to exceed the $5.2 billion six-month ceiling on oil sales under the program that permits the Government to import food, medicines and other goods for civilians. Iraq is expected to earn at least $7 billion during the six-month period, ending in November, largely because of higher oil prices, and will be permitted to count the surplus as compensation for earlier shortfalls. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
IRAQ: POLIO VACCINES -- The World Health Organization, alarmed at a polio outbreak in Iraq, began a national immunization program there with Unicef. The organizations are to vaccinate 3.5 million children under the age of 5, including the children of nomadic families who may be carrying the disease across borders to nations where polio is no longer endemic. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
SAUDI ARABIA: NEW ROLE FOR WOMEN -- As many as 20 Saudi women have attended a session of the Government's consultative council for the first time, the London Arabic newspaper Al Hayat reported. The admission of women, who followed the proceedings from a balcony, came on Sunday, one day after the head of the Shura Council, Mohammed bin Jubair, said, "Society and the Shura Council must benefit from the qualifications and experience of women." (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Heller Financial in a Deal with CIT Group

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The commercial financing company Heller Financial Inc. said today that it would sell its commercial services unit to CIT Group Inc. for $560 million, exiting a 64-year-old line of business the company now feels it is not large enough to successfully compete in.
The unit includes the domestic factoring business, which lends money to textile and apparel manufacturers, taking over the companies' accounts receivable. Heller started in the factoring business in 1935. 
 "Heller has a long, rich history in the U.S. factoring business, but we believe that long-term success in this business increasingly requires substantial economies of scale, which commercial services will not be able to achieve through internal growth," Heller's chairman and chief executive, Richard Almeida, said in a statement.
The unit also includes asset-based revolving credit facilities and accounts receivable management services.
The unit had net assets of $435 million on Aug. 31, reflecting $953 million of factored accounts receivable and $518 million of credit balances due factoring clients.
The unit employs about 375 people, primarily in New York and Glendale, Calif.

In Describing Health Care Plans, Less is More

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
What is the difference between a policy that promises to cover 100 percent of Americans for medical costs and a policy that covers 95 percent of them? About 1,285 pages.
President Clinton took about 1,300 pages in 1994 to lay out his plan for insuring ever American. Bill Bradley took about 15 pages last week to describe a plan to increase the percentage of Americans with medical insurance to 95 percent. 
 O.K., I'm comparing apples and oranges. Mr. Clinton's plan covered every legislative tidbit. Mr. Bradley issued only an outline. Yet the point remains valid. Mr. Clinton's team never made its fiendishly complicated rewrite of a trillion-dollar industry decipherable to Congress or anyone else despite nearly a year of intense lobbying.
Mr. Bradley's plan, by contrast, can be boiled down to one simple sentence. He invites uninsured Americans to buy coverage -- with subsidies for families earning less than about $50,000 a year -- through the Federal program that currently covers members of Congress and other Federal employees.
Mr. Bradley achieves simplicity by forsaking 100 percent coverage. He says his system, by opening up Congress's plan to everyone else, will persuade all but 5 percent of the population to buy coverage voluntarily. The estimate may be unrealistically low, but it is not daffy. The Clinton staff estimated that it could raise coverage from about 85 percent of the population to the low 90's with tax credits and other carrots.
But in the giddy first months of his Administration, Mr. Clinton refused to settle for anything short of universal coverage. His experts told him that persuading the last remnants of the population to join health plans would require huge subsidies. So Mr. Clinton turned instead to mandates -- everyone would be required to buy coverage. That required many pages of rules. With mandates would come opposition, from small business, large business, the self-employed. In anticipation, the Clinton plan built in huge subsidies for Detroit auto makers and others. Add more pages. Then the plan imposed elaborate rules to prevent waste and abuse of the subsidies. That took more pages still.
Next, Mr. Clinton proposed to redesign every corner of the health care industry, from the number of doctors that hospitals would train each year to the tiniest detail of the insurance policy everyone in American would be required to buy. Add dozens more pages of complex regulations.
Mr. Bradley's plan skipped much of this mess by making a second simplifying decision. Instead of redesigning health care, he piggybacked coverage of the uninsured onto an existing health-insurance system, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, warts and all. There are warts. The Federal program provides too little incentive for enrollees to choose inexpensive plans and imposes unintended penalties on plans that do a good job catering to the sickest, most-expensive-to-treat patients.
Yet the Federal program works reasonably well, and that is good enough for Mr. Bradley. Besides, there is a clever incentive system built into his plan. By tying the uninsured to Congress's own plan, Mr. Bradley insures that the uninsured will be treated well indeed.
Will Mr. Bradley's plan cut the rising rolls of the uninsured? The issue took on poignancy this week as the Government released data showing that the percentage of the population without coverage rose slightly last year despite a booming economy. Mr. Bradley's subsidies, which he estimates will cost up to $65 billion a year but which some experts fear could reach several times that amount, might be too small to achieve voluntary compliance.
But if the subsidies are raised too high, they could trigger a destructive reaction. Small employers tired of administering an expensive, complicated fringe benefit might decide to drop coverage entirely and direct their workers to the subsidized Federal program. The threat is that many of the workers who lose coverage at work, especially those whose incomes make them ineligible for Mr. Bradley's subsidies, would choose to remain uninsured. If so, Mr. Bradley's program could wind up doing more harm than good.
Mr. Bradley has responses for these problems. His subsidies would go to low-income workers even if they continued to get coverage through an employer. That way the Bradley programs would not encourage workers to switch to the Federal program. And, by limiting subsidies to low-income families, he would discourage employers from abandoning coverage for everyone else.
Whatever the outcome of the Bradley approach, whether coverage rises to 95 percent or something less, Congress could then take a hard look at those who are left out and design a fix tailored specifically to their plight. This strategy would not achieve a grand leap to 100 percent coverage, but neither would it run up thousands of pages of rules for Congress to choke on.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Shares Show Wide Gains As Interest Rate Fears Ease

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose broadly yesterday on the apparent conviction that Federal Reserve policy makers will not raise short-term interest rates at their meeting today.
Interest-sensitive stocks like banks and brokerage firms were at the forefront of the advance. But telecommunications companies gained on merger news, transportation shares did well and drug stocks advanced. 
 Led by American Express, Procter & Gamble and General Electric, the Dow Jones industrial average registered its biggest gain in a month, rising 128.23 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,401.23. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 21.79, or 1.7 percent, to 1,304.60, led by Microsoft, Wal-Mart, Citicorp and Intel. A big gain in Nextel helped push the Nasdaq composite index up 59.12, or 2.2 percent, to 2,795.97. And the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 3.08, or 0.7 percent, to 426.61.
Trading volume, which has been light on Mondays the last few months, was a bit heavier yesterday.
More than 803 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq stock market, nearly 915 million shares changed hands.
Despite the improvement, traders and analysts said the market still seemed fragile. Yesterday's gains, and a lot more, could be lost if the Fed chooses to raise rates, they said.
"I am very surprised at the rally," said Ned Collins, head trader at Daiwa Securities America. "But I am not totally convinced the market has worked through all its problems. Something in the back of my mind says this is not the turn."
The stock market has had its eye on today's Fed meeting for weeks, and the fear that members of the Federal Open Market Committee will vote to raise rates has helped to drive market averages down from the record highs set in the summer.
Even if the Fed decides not to raise rates at the meeting, those fears are likely to linger, analysts said.
"I don't think there is much conviction in the buying that went on" in the session, said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.
"At best, this is probably a trading rally. We will have to get through this quarter and the Y2K worries before the market will be set to move higher again."
Long-term interest rates moved lower yesterday, helped by a drop in oil prices.
The decline in rates touched off buying in financial stocks, which had been punished for some months.
American Express, a Dow component, gained 6 3/16, to 137 9/16. Citigroup rose 1 7/16, to 44 11/16. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter jumped 5 1/8, to 93 15/16. And Merrill Lynch rose 2 15/16, to 68 13/16.
BellSouth's cash-and-stock bid for Sprint spurred a rally in telecommunications shares. Sprint gained 3 7/8, to 60 7/8. MCI Worldcom, another suitor for Sprint, gained 1 1/8, to 71 5/8. BellSouth's shares fell 2 11/16, to 42 11/16. (After the market closed yesterday, people close to the negotiations said MCI would acquire Sprint in a stock swap vauled at $108 billion.)
Nextel jumped 5 1/8, to 75 3/8. Voicestream Wireless rose 3 5/8, to 62 11/16, and Qwest Communications rose 2 13/16, to 32 11/16.
Transportation stocks were helped by a decline in oil prices.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 5 3/8, to 59 1/4. Delta Air Lines gained 3 1/16, to 50 5/8. And UAL, the parent of United Airlines, gained 2 7/8, to 67 1/8.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Rise
 By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices rose yesterday as investors bet that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates when its policy makers meet today.
"Nobody feels the Fed will actually pull the trigger," and that is helping the market, said Deborah Cunningham, who manages about $68 billion in taxable money-market funds at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond gained 19/32, to 100 18/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.08 percent from 6.13 percent on Friday.
Investors spent the bulk of the day preparing for today's Fed meeting. The central bank already lifted its target for overnight bank lending, the Federal funds rate, in June and August to cool growth and head off inflation. The two increases raised the rate to 5.25 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.804	97.538	High Rate	4.73%	4.87%	Coupon Yield	4.86%	5.07%	Low Rate	4.63%	4.77%	Median Rate	4.71%	4.86%	Total applied for	$29,381,529	$28,577,944	Accepted	$12,430,629	$11,938,144	Noncompetitive	$1,271,164	$1,174,256	

Both issues are dated Oct. 7, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 6, 2000, and the six-month bills mature on April 6, 2000.

The refugee agency hopes to start charter flights tomorrow. A12 

Indonesia's highest legislative assembly convened for a fourth day and listened to remarks by the new Speaker, Amien Rais, who was elected on Sunday. Jakarta was mostly peaceful, as people focused on the televised assembly proceedings, but on an island east of Jakarta fighting broke out again between Muslims and Christians. Fifteen people were killed in the clashes, and houses and a mosque were burned. A12
 
Action at Japan Nuclear Sites
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan ordered emergency inspections of all the country's nuclear-fuel treatment plants and reactors.

HEADLINE: Executives Seeking Caps On Donations Stand Strong

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Leaders of a group of business executives who have endorsed a ban on unlimited campaign contributions announced today that their ranks had doubled to 209 members since the committee was chastised last summer by Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate's most outspoken critic of overhauling the campaign finance system.
Leaders of the organization, the Committee for Economic Development, said they had benefited from publicity about Mr. McConnell's letter-writing campaign that urged more than 20 members to resign from the committee. In the letters mailed in late July, Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, accused the committee of trying to "eviscerate private sector participation in politics." 
 But the group's president said today that the attacks by Mr. McConnell, who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party's major fund-raising group for Senate candidates, had backfired; not one executive has taken the senator's advice. Instead, Mr. McConnell's tactics touched off a surge in interest among chief executives, civic leaders and college presidents, Charles Kolb, the president of the Committee for Economic Development, said today.
"He has been a tremendous help to us," Mr. Kolb said. "This is the greatest evidence yet that many business leaders want to reform our system of financing elections."
Robert Steurer, Mr. McConnell's spokesman, did not return a phone call seeking comment today. Stewart Roy, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, declined to comment.
The economic committee's announcement of its membership spurt comes at an opportune moment for advocates of an overhaul of the nation's campaign finance laws. The Senate is expected this month to debate a bill that would ban soft money, the unlimited donations that corporations, unions and wealthy individuals give to political parties.
On Sept. 15, the House passed a comprehensive campaign finance bill. The sponsors of a similar bill in the Senate, John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, have said they will rewrite their bill to focus solely on a ban on soft money.
The economic committee strongly urges Congress to ban such unlimited contributions, but it also endorses raising the limit on contributions to individual candidates to $3,000 from the current $1,000. The committee also calls for partial public financing for Congressional elections and voluntary spending limits.
Although the 209 executives work for some of America's leading corporations, they speak only for themselves and not on behalf of their employers. But Mr. Kolb said they have discovered that more executives are willing to speak out because they have become disgusted by the parties' insatiable appetites for large corporate contributions.
"They're tired of being hit up for ever-increasing amounts of cash," Mr. Kolb said, "and they know the system is exacting a heavy toll on our democracy."
The endorsers of the economic committee's plan include executives at Goldman Sachs, Salomon Smith Barney, Prudential, State Farm, H&R Block, Motorola, Sara Lee, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, Hasbro and Chubb. Endorsers of the measures also include the retired chairmen or chief executives of Allied Signal, BankAmerica, GTE, International Paper, Union Pacific and General Foods, among others.

HEADLINE: With Sport Utility Vehicles More Popular, Overall Automobile Fuel Economy Continues to Fall

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The average fuel economy of new vehicles fell to 23.8 miles per gallon in the 1999 model year, the lowest level since 1980, as Americans continued to shift from cars to less fuel-efficient light trucks, particularly sport utility vehicles, the Environmental Protection Agency has concluded in a new report.
The study, the agency's first on fuel-economy trends in three years, found that while average fuel economy peaked at 25.9 miles per gallon in the 1987 and 1988 model years and has been falling since then, the decline has accelerated. All of the fuel economy gains from technological improvements over the last dozen years have been more than offset by a shift toward heavier, more powerful automobiles, the report said. 
 Some of the information in the report has been available separately in statistical tables from the Transportation Department, which actually administers the Federal regulations that set minimum fuel-economy standards for new cars and light trucks. But this study was the first to report the average for the 1999 model year, which fell six-tenths of a mile per gallon from the 1998 model year, the steepest decline since record keeping began in 1975.
The report was posted on the agency's Internet site at the end of last week with no announcement. Agency officials in Washington said today that they had meant to release the report later this week with an announcement and expressed surprise that the document had already been posted by the agency's automotive pollution division, which wrote it.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers in Washington, said that when a gallon of gasoline costs less than a gallon of bottled water or a cup of Starbucks coffee there is little demand for fuel efficiency.
The timing of the report's release, less than three weeks after the Senate held its first vote on fuel-economy issues in nine years, drew criticism from environmentalists. On Sept. 15, the Senate voted 55 to 40 against allowing the Transportation Department to review its fuel-economy regulations.
"It's unfortunate the Administration didn't provide this information to senators until after they'd had a chance to vote," said Daniel Becker, the energy policy director at the Sierra Club.
David Cohen, an E.P.A. spokesman, said the timing was coincidental. "The report was put out as soon as we had the data reviewed," Mr. Cohen said.
Vice President Al Gore was an outspoken supporter of more stringent fuel-economy rules in 1990, when he was in the Senate. But when President Bush warned in the 1992 Presidential campaign that tighter rules might destroy auto industry jobs in Ohio and Michigan, Mr. Gore and Bill Clinton shifted their position, calling instead for Federal subsidies for the auto industry to design more efficient cars.
Mr. Gore did not take a position during last month's debate in the Senate. His rival for the Democratic Presidential nomination, former Senator Bill Bradley, who has been courting environmentalists, did endorse tighter fuel-economy rules before the Senate vote.
Every year since Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, they have added riders to the Transportation Department's budget barring any spending to investigate fuel-economy issues. The E.P.A. is not covered by this ban.
The Transportation Department's rules require that each auto maker sell cars with an average fuel economy of at least 27.5 miles per gallon and light trucks with an average fuel economy of at least 20.7 miles per gallon. Sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans are all counted as light trucks.
"The increasing market share of light-duty trucks, which have lower average fuel economy than cars, is the primary reason for the decline in fuel economy of the overall new light vehicle fleet," the E.P.A. report said.
The published figures indicated that auto makers were having trouble complying with fuel-economy rules for light trucks. The average fuel-economy for all light trucks sold in the United States in the 1999 model year was 20.3 miles per gallon.
Manufacturers are liable for fines of $5.50 per automobile sold times the number of tenths of a mile per gallon they fall short of the standard. With the exception of Land Rover, auto makers have avoided paying fines until now because they exceeded the minimum standard in previous years and have carried forward fuel-economy credits as a result. But auto makers are running low on credits.

MCI Worldcom to Acquire Sprint in a $108 Billion Deal
MCI Worldcom will acquire Sprint in a stock swap valued at $108 billion, people close to the talks said.
Sprint had been discussing a merger with MCI Worldcom for two weeks but received a $100 billion unsolicited offer on Saturday from BellSouth, the regional Bell company based in Atlanta. BellSouth even raised its offer, too, but the extra money was not enough to sway Sprint's board. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Radio City, With Face Lift, Reopens

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
After a face lift that cost $70 million -- double the original estimates -- and left the stage dark for seven months, Radio City Music Hall reopened last night in a blaze of lights and celebrity hoopla befitting one of New York City's more enduring show-business icons.
The Cablevision Systems Corporation, which has operated the 67-year-old Music Hall since 1997 and spent $30 million just to rewire the building, was determined to stage a reopening celebration in keeping with the hall's Art Deco glamour. Appearing on the huge stage were not only the 36 Rockettes, but also Billy Crystal, Tony Bennett, Liza Minnelli, Sting, Ann-Margret, Tom Brokaw and Christian Slater, who played Tiny Tim at the hall in a Christmas show when he was 12. 
 "I have a lot of memories of this gracious lady of a grand old theater," said Mr. Crystal, raising a roar of laughter when he appeared on stage in a tuxedo from the waist up -- and Rockette pantyhose from the waist down. There were actually wolf whistles from the crowd
Arriving celebrity ticketholders ran the media gantlet on a blocklong red carpet, sheltered by canvas from torrents of rain. They included Mr. Bennett, who judged that "the new hall is magnificent"; Don King, who pronounced the music hall "the perfect edifice to make an exquisite boxing match," and Donald J. Trump, who allowed that his parents "took me to see the Rockettes when I was young, which started my love affair with beautiful women."
One of the best-received moments of the show came at 9:30 P.M., when James L. Dolan, Cablevision's president and chief executive, announced that "it's the bottom of the seventh and the Mets are up five-nothing," satisfying the desperate curiosity of National League pennant-race watchers.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did not make an appearance, and it was just as well.
The evening's host, the actor Barry Bostwick, who plays the mayor on the television show "Spin City," made the first of many references to Mayor Giuliani's opposition to the new show at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, terming the Rockettes "beautiful, not that the Mayor is any judge of art." He was applauded.
For local merchants, the Music Hall reopening was also an occasion for unrestrained joy. "When those marquee lights went on, I got a huge smile on my face," said David Liederman, owner of Chez Louis, a restaurant directly across the street on West 50th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. "It's been a long seven months, when Rockefeller Center looked like a deserted area. Now there will be more customers, and I think this reopening will be the catalyst to reinvent Rockefeller Center."
Indeed, the Music Hall's revival was part of a master plan by Jerry I. Speyer, the manager and part owner of Rockefeller Center, to resuscitate what he has called "the world's most famous address." He expects Radio City to drive the center's nighttime activities in the future.
Cablevision has estimated that the Music Hall will attract two million visitors a year and contribute more than $300 million to the city's economy.
A black-tie audience of 5,400 last night saw 6.5 miles of new red, blue and gold neon installed in the hall's legendary blocklong marquee, and applauded the sound of the auditorium's Mighty Wurlitzer pipe organ with its 4,178 restored pipes.
Proceeds from ticket sales for the 2-hour-and-15-minute show, which will be televised as a prime-time NBC special in early December, went to the Lustgarten Pancreatic Cancer Research Foundation in honor of Marc A. Lustgarten, a Madison Square Garden executive who recently died of the disease.
The doubling in restoration costs demonstrated not only the perils of sophisticated restoration work in Manhattan, but also Cablevision's determination to have the new hall up and running in time for its venerable "Radio City Christmas Spectacular."
That will open on Nov. 4, the first event in the new hall for which tickets are still available.
The restoration, the most ambitious since the hall opened in 1932 as a vaudeville and movie house, employed 2,000 workers. They burnished ceilings with 720,000 sheets of gold and aluminum leaf, lowered the old muddy red two-ton stage curtain and installed a new 112-foot-wide shimmery golden silk replacement. They also put in 5,901 new salmon-pink plush seats.
The hall's furniture, wall fabric, carpeting, lighting fixtures and appointments have been cleaned, repaired or remade. And the three-story-tall mural "The Fountain of Youth," by Ezra Winter, which looms above the grand staircase, was cleaned of decades of grime, varnish and polyurethane.
The restoration was intended to preserve and modernize the hall, which has been rewired for high-definition television. And to enable Cablevision to present events and concerts broadcast "live from Radio City," 32 camera positions have been established.
The renovation is part of an ambitious plan of Cablevision, which in addition to leasing the Music Hall owns the 18,000-seat Madison Square Garden and its 5,600-seat theater, to consolidate the booking of its entertainment events.
In December 1997, Cablevision leased Radio City Music Hall from its owner, Tishman Speyer Properties, for 25 years, and bought the rights to both the Rockettes and the Christmas pageant from the Mitsubishi Estate Company. Cablevision also operates cable channels, produces television shows and provides cable service to 3.4 million customers.
Despite the $70 million price tag, the Music Hall design was somewhat scaled down. Plans for a new nightclub, computer-controlled lighting and virtual-reality hall tours were dropped because of worries about the reaction of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The exterior of the Music Hall and its public interior spaces, as well as some furnishings, were designated New York City landmarks in 1979.
And in the end, it was Mr. Slater who saluted the staying power of the hall, saying that it "survived two wars and Run-DMC, a real threat to its existence."

A 58-year-old black man in a city with a history of chronic poverty and acute racial tensions, Mr. Jones opened his first McDonald's restaurant here in the 1980's with a loan from a Chicago bank after Memphis banks had turned him down. He now owns six McDonald's restaurants and sits on the board of a Memphis bank.
"But not a single one of those openings has been easy," Mr. Jones said over coffee at his first store, on the corner of a fading shopping center in the largely black south Memphis neighborhood of Southgate. "I can tell as far as black businesses go, they have not done well. A few like me have been able to slip through the cracks, but very few." 
 By all accounts, the nation has been enjoying an extraordinarily healthy economy. With nearly nine years of unimpeded growth, with jobs abundant, poverty declining, interest rates down and the Federal budget back in the black, almost everyone has been enriched. Americans are earning more than ever, an average of $460 a week or nearly $24,000 a year for all nonsupervisory workers.
But a look at any American community, in this case the old cotton-trading port of Memphis, shows how selective prosperity can be in blessing some people more than others. Blacks have benefited much less than other groups, according to the latest census data, and even black entrepreneurs like Mr. Jones say they still must struggle.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research organization in Washington, has reported that by the end of this year the after-tax income of the richest 1 percent of the population will have climbed 115 percent since 1977 -- more than doubling. But it will have risen only 8 percent for middle-income households and declined 9 percent for the poorest one-fifth of the population.
The issue of income disparity is finding its way into the national political debate. But it is also playing out at the local level, nowhere more so than Memphis, a city of 600,000 people, 55 percent of whom are black and drawn mostly from the destitute rural communities of the Mississippi Delta west and south of the city.
In nonpartisan elections on Oct. 7, with 15 men and women running for mayor, poverty and race are the leitmotifs in the conflicts between the two leading candidates over how the city exploits its prosperity. Challengers to Mayor Willie Herenton question whether he has done enough to help lift up the people at the bottom of the income ladder and open opportunities for those like Mr. Jones, who strive for a chance to build a business.
While defending his focus on rebuilding the city's core, Mr. Herenton, who is black, acknowledges "a major weakness" in cultural and financial institutions in the city, which remain impervious to many black Memphians.
"We have a nagging problem of poverty, especially in the African-American population," Mr. Herenton said. "Memphis has not experienced a major breakthrough for African-Americans in terms of accumulating wealth."
While prosperity has expanded the black middle class, he said, "African-Americans are absent from any influence at the top tier" of economic leadership. "It's not an easy city to break the barriers of the past, getting capital, doing joint ventures, developing strategic alliances with successful majority companies," the Mayor said.
Compared with any earlier decade, these have been good times for Memphis. It bills itself as the capital of the mid-South, the home of Elvis Presley, Beale Street and the blues and Federal Express, which has made the city the world's biggest air cargo hub.
The city is within commuting distance of Tunica, Miss., a once-impoverished Delta town that has become a phenomenon of the decade of prosperity with the start of casino gambling there seven years ago. And cotton, though ailing from falling prices and excess supply, has rebounded from the assault of synthetic fibers. The National Cotton Institute here says 61 percent of Americans' clothes now contain cotton, compared with 40 percent a decade ago.
In general, these industries' good fortune has spilled across this city's economy. It has given the newly employed former welfare recipients time to build skills that can help them hold their jobs in harder times, and it discourages discrimination in hiring because employers have to bore deeper than ever into the ranks of the unemployed to find workers.
"These are really the best of times," said John E. Gnuschke, director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Memphis. "Everyone has moved up a notch," he said, "even the poorest." Income per person in Memphis, $25,905 in 1997, began exceeding the growth of the national average five years ago.
Higher incomes, Mr. Gnuschke said, have helped propel African-Americans out of the city's decrepit public housing projects. "The suburbanization of the black population didn't happen in the past," Mr. Gnuschke added, "and it's happening now. Differences in income levels kept people segregated, and that's changing."
Willie Joe Alexander, an African-American and the president of Local 1733 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose 4,000 members are mostly black, said: "I can see members of this union who were walking and are now driving cars. I can see members who were renters who are now buyers, who procrastinated about their kids' education who are now educating them."
Marc Jordan, president of the Memphis Area Chamber of Commerce, who is white, said leading businesses were doing a lot of "partnering, mentoring and getting people to participate in business ventures." He added, "I know of minority companies that are doing real well," like a moving and storage company and a new black bank.
"And if you look at starting wages," Mr. Jordan said, "they're moving up. People in warehouses are making $10 and $12 an hour. There are just ample opportunities for people who want to move up."
But such measures of progress are relative. Herman C. Ewing, president of the Memphis Urban League, said that incomes of African-Americans were about 62 percent of those of whites, compared with 60 percent a decade ago, before the start of the boom.
While Memphis's resurgent downtown throbs with the jackhammers of affluence, its aged, debris-infested public housing, occupied mostly by blacks, has not been touched. Businesses that followed African-Americans into outlying suburbs and sylvan subdivisions are heading for the malls in more affluent communities.
Whitehaven, for example, the south Memphis neighborhood that is home to both Mr. Herenton and his top challenger in the mayoral race, Joe Ford, an African-American who is chairman of the City Council, is a community of small ranch houses. It was 80 percent white two decades ago and is now 80 percent black.
With the shift in the population, Whitehaven has recently lost some major retailers, like Kinney Shoes, a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer, a Target store and a Red Lobster restaurant. And store vacancies have surged.
According to analyses by the economic research bureau at the University of Memphis, the city suffers deeper poverty and has less economic opportunity than most of the cities the business leaders consider their rivals: Atlanta; Dallas; Indianapolis; Nashville, Tenn.; Charlotte, N.C.; Birmingham, Ala., and Louisville, Ky.
When last measured four years ago, Memphis's poverty rate, 18.1 percent, far exceeded those in cities like Atlanta and Nashville, and Mr. Gnuschke sees little reason to think the gap has narrowed measurably since then. In the 1996-97 academic year, Memphis spent about 90 percent of the average of what was being spent on education by its rival cities.
Its unemployment rate, though low at just above 3 percent, still exceeds the rates of its rivals. A reason might be the challenges black businesses face here. Employment in black-owned businesses grew an average of 2.4 percent a year from 1982 to 1992, the latest years for which comparable figures are available. The average for the other cities was 8.4 percent.
To the extent that crime and economics are linked, prosperity in Memphis has been a mixed blessing. Two years ago, Mr. Gnuschke's studies show, 107.4 of every 100,000 women in Memphis had been raped here, more than double the rate for the other cities. Memphis's homicide rate then, 15.9 per 100,000 people, exceeded the rates of all its rivals except Birmingham.
The grim statistics weigh on the record of Mayor Herenton, a 6-foot, 6-inch former boxer and superintendent of schools. By a mere 142 votes eight years ago, he became the city's first black mayor in a race against a white incumbent that broke sharply along racial lines.
He promptly set about building rapport with the white business establishment while retaining his support among blacks. Running against a conservative white challenger four years ago, he won in a landslide, with 74 percent of the vote.
This time, Mr. Ford, 45, a funeral home director and scion of a political dynasty here, has seized upon the economic stagnation of the city's black neighborhoods, chastising the Mayor for leading a renaissance of the long-ailing downtown with tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks for the city's biggest developers, all white.
"Whitehaven, south Memphis, Raleigh, Frayser," Mr. Ford said of predominantly black communities. "We've got stores moving and houses deteriorating. We just left them out there dangling."
An African-American who does get a foot in goes only so far. "We've become better educated in the last 10 years," said Audrey McGhee, editor of The Tri-State Defender, the city's weekly black newspaper. "The most important thing we find out is that the ceiling isn't glass. It's concrete."
Olivia Dobbins, president and chief executive of the Black Business Association, says her phone rings constantly with blacks wanting to participate in the flourishing economy by starting businesses. "And they're crying, 'We can't get loans,' " she said.
Blacks stand on the sidelines of the city's economic development, added Fred L. Davis, a leading black insurance broker, because they own few of the businesses that can participate. The city-owned power company needs utility poles, pipes, cable and office furniture. "But it's hard to find a black distributor," Mr. Davis said.
Then, when blacks might spread their spending among black businesses, they head instead for the white suburban malls. Mr. Davis has two business cards -- "my white card and my colored card." The back of the white card is blank, but on the back of those he hands to blacks, he has printed:
"Did you know that 97 1/2 cents out of every dollar blacks spend leaves the community? Guess why we are poor and powerless."
Mr. Jones, the McDonald's owner, was the budget officer for the housing authority in Chicago and the owner of five apartment buildings there, all paid for, when he came across a Time magazine article about doctors and lawyers who were leaving their practices to open McDonald's restaurants.
"I decided to give it a shot," Mr. Jones said, "and I was accepted into the McDonald's program." Upon completing his training, he said, "I was told I could go anywhere, and Memphis was where I wanted to go."
The company had just built the Southgate store, at the corner of a shopping center, and Mr. Jones agreed to take it on. But he needed a loan to buy the franchise.
"Banks here did not want to give me a loan, even though I had solid financial statements," he said. "Fortunately, I had a cousin who was a bank president in Chicago, so I went there to get it."

NBC Buys Rights to Televise the Triple Crown, Long Held by ABC

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
NBC Sports broke ABC's long grip on the Triple Crown thoroughbred races yesterday by buying their television rights for five years starting in 2001.
NBC bid $48 million, but it structured the contract with Triple Crown Productions to include an early upfront payment of nearly one-quarter of the total fee, which will make the deal worth $51.5 million. 
 ABC, which could relinquish to NBC its rights to carry the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes next year, offered $35 million, said Tom Meeker, president of Triple Crown Productions.
With the deal, NBC will have the elite bookends of televised horse racing -- the Triple Crown in the spring and the Breeders' Cup in the fall.
A major reason for leaving ABC -- besides the money -- was for the Triple Crown to end competition with National Basketball Association playoff games.
NBC always programmed early-round playoff games against the first two legs of the Triple Crown. Now, NBC will use its prime-time shows and the playoff games to promote the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. The first two games of the N.B.A. finals, on Wednesday and Friday nights, will be employed to promote the Belmont Stakes.
"We saw NBC as the network of opportunity, through their association with the N.B.A., the Olympics and the Ryder Cup," Meeker said.
Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, said, "With the N.B.A. as a promotional platform, I'd expect ratings growth of 10, 15 or 20 percent for the Derby and the Preakness."
The loss of the races is a blow for ABC, which has carried the Kentucky Derby since 1975 and the others since 1987. Meeker said the network might have retained the package had Howard Katz, the president of ABC Sports, been in charge of the division before March. "Before Howard, things had changed at ABC that caused us to question its commitment to the Triple Crown," Meeker said.
Katz said: "I don't know if I could have changed the economics more than I did. We put together what was an aggressive bid, but we were blown away. I'm devastated to lose this. But I'd feel a lot worse if our bids were close."
The loss of the races will mean less work for the host Jim McKay, who recently signed a new contract with ABC. At NBC, the role McKay shared with Al Michaels will be assumed by Tom Hammond.
"Jim and I will think of some other assignments," Katz said. McKay's only other current work at ABC besides the races is at the British Open.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 12, 1999, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A sports article last Tuesday about NBC's purchase of television rights to the Triple Crown horse races misattributed information about a competing bid, from ABC. The source of that information was not Tom Meeker, the president of Triple Crown Productions, but another person involved in the deal, who declined to be identified publicly.

HEADLINE: HBO Plans a Drama Based on 'Stiffed'

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Home Box Office has acquired rights to the newly published Susan Faludi book, "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man," and plans to turn it into a television drama next year.
The book, about what Ms. Faludi calls "the American masculinity crisis," was purchased for a "mid-six-figure" sum, people involved in the negotiations said. HBO executives said that the cable network hoped to turn the nonfiction book into an anthology of one or perhaps two films dramatizing the stories of some of the men depicted in the book. It was acquired for Robert Greenwald, a well-known television producer-director. 
 Ms. Faludi's 662-page treatise, some chapters of which have already been sold for two other adaptations, was featured on the Sept. 13 cover of Newsweek. A blend of reporting and cultural analysis, it focuses on a variety of men whose lives seem in crisis and have "lost their compass in the world," the author said.
The men range from unemployed workers at the naval shipyard in Long Beach, Calif., to students at the Citadel, the military school forced to admit its first woman in 1994, to gang members, to teen-age boys in the Spur Posse, the group accused of multiple incidents of sexual assault.
Mr. Greenwald, who produced and directed the six-hour NBC mini-series "A Woman of Independent Means," said, "The book has about 10 very powerful dramatic stories, and we're in the process of deciding which of the stories to do." He said he had been tracking the book for about three years and that HBO was the perfect home for it.
"They're not bound by any of the conventional rules," he said. "You can tell the story in whatever way the material demands."
Ron Bernstein, Ms. Faludi's agent at the Gersh Agency in Los Angeles, said that two sections of the book had been sold earlier. One, about male pornography stars, which appeared in the New Yorker in 1995, was sold to HBO to be turned into a television drama. But the project was shelved because of the release of the movie "Boogie Nights," which dealt with the world of pornography. Another portion of the book, about United States Marine recruiters, has been purchased by New Regency films, and a script is in development for two producers, Lisa Henson and Janet Yang.
By all accounts several film and television companies also expressed interest in acquiring the book. Ms. Faludi's last book was the 1991 best seller "Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women," which dealt with what she argued was the misogyny, half-truths and falsehoods marshaled against women.

Sibling Revelry: When More Isn't Merrier

BYLINE: By REGINA SCHRAMBLING 

 BODY:
THE first night I uncovered parkerhouse rolls in a bread basket, at Wild Blue, I thought they were a novel revival. At a time when strong and chewy sourdough is almost a cliche, why not bring back soft and buttery yeast rolls from the Betty Crocker heyday?
The next time I came across a parkerhouse roll, at Blackbird, I was even more intrigued. One more sighting, and it would be a trend.
It was the same reaction I had had to the crab cakes I tasted first at Park Avalon, then at Blue Water Grill, then at Ocean Grill. They all looked and tasted oddly similar: backfin crab meat judiciously jazzed up with scallions, fried with a crisp crust and set on streaks of some spicy variation on tartar sauce. 
 Eventually, I remembered that both the bread baskets and the crab cakes were the work of restaurant groups, the BE Group in the first instance and BR Guest in the second. Neither was a case of great chefs' thinking alike. And both were symptoms of a growing phenomenon in New York restaurants: a creeping but ineffable familiarity.
More and more, new restaurants actually look alike, with the sleek chill of a corporate board room: dark stained wood, recessed lighting, muted upholstery, bars with boxlike compartments for wine and spirits, and understated floral arrangements, if any. They sound alike, with a contented buzz of conversation blending into some form of elevator jazz on the sound system. Their staffs exude a "we are happy to serve you" affability. And their "Americanized Mediterranean" menus certainly read alike: house-cured salmon and heirloom tomato salad and wood-roasted striped bass and braised veal shank. They seem designed by committee, and in fact many were.
The sea change in restaurants is not about chefs but about restaurateurs -- developers, if you will. In 1989, the 15 most popular restaurants in the Zagat Survey were independently owned (most by chefs) and one of a kind. Today only one of the most popular 10 fits that description.
It was a natural progression: first, the avenues became open-air malls lined with Godiva next to Origins next to Barnes & Noble. And once New Yorkers all started dressing from Banana Republic, it was an easy step into high-end chain restaurants with the same tasteful but tame look.
Many of the restaurants being promoted most heavily lately have emerged from groups seemingly on fertility drugs. Pershing Square Cafe, across 42d Street from Grand Central Terminal, is the latest link in Buzzy O'Keeffe's chain (River Cafe, the Water Club), and Southwest is the latest in Abraham Merchant's chain (Merchants cafes, La Fourchette).
Shelly Fireman's group recently announced plans to convert the Motown Cafe into some variation on a food theme park while it continues to serve nonthreatening fare in a cluster of restaurants near Carnegie Hall. From the oversize nose motifs on the wall at Trattoria dell'Arte to the retro look of the Brooklyn Diner and the any-food-any-time menu at Redeye Grill, his restaurants offer food as entertainment without descending into Harley-Davidson circuses.
The Santos Family Group, the progenitors of the old Sign of the Dove who converted the Yellowfingers pasta place to a slicker but accessible Cibi Cibi, are still running the Latin-themed Bolivar next door and are rebuilding Arizona 206 and a new Sign downtown. Each is like the clothing departments at Bloomingdale's: each a little bit different but all following the same fashion.
The BE Group, with David Emil and his backers in one configuration or another, is responsible for Wild Blue (a riff on an American chophouse), Blackbird (built around its innovative cocktails) and Beacon (open fire cooking). Now, the group is developing a new restaurant on top of the Equitable tower, and don't be surprised if it looks like the group's prototype room, Blackbird.
The Myriad Group, run by Drew Nieporent, started with Montrachet and Nobu and most recently opened Berkeley Bar and Grill in the Sony Building (like its TriBeCa Grill with a tie-dye motif) and Heartbeat in the W Hotel on Lexington Avenue (pillars with echoes of Layla) and is planning to open Icon in another W hotel.
Chefs with deep-pocket backers are also cloning with abandon, of course: Jean-Georges Vongerichten now has five restaurants in New York, and Charlie Palmer, Daniel Boulud and Larry Forgione have three each. But each of them is a culinarian first, a businessman second. And their patrons tend to come for the food, not necessarily the familiarity.
Restaurant groups have been a force on the city's food front since the beginnings of Restaurant Associates in the 1960's. Michael Weinstein runs Ark (America, Ernie's, Columbus Bakery, Lutece), for instance, and Alan Stillman his New York Restaurant Group.
But it used to be that patrons were never reminded of how all those places were connected unless it was wine week, when the stuff was poured free at Mr. Stillman's restaurants: Smith & Wollensky, the Manhattan Ocean Club, Park Avenue Cafe and the Post House. That was a time when New Yorkers, then blessed with independent drugstores and movie theaters, sought out the Chanterelles and the Bouleys.
Now, Myriad tucks its dinner checks into folders advertising other outposts in the chain, and BR Guest gives out postcards picturing all its properties: Ruby Foo's, Isabella's, Park Avalon, Coconut Grill, Blue Water Grill, Ocean Grill, Atlantic Grill.
Even without the visual aids, there are hints that they are related: wicker cafe chairs, marble-topped brasserie tables in the bar, black-and-white photographs, dark stained wood and comfortable banquettes. If there was any doubt, the bartender who suggests the Ruby Foo cocktail as the best choice at Ocean Grill would vanquish it.
At a time when the city is reveling in safe streets, it seems to be falling victim to safe restaurants. No one is likely to suffer an aneurysm over overly creative food, even at Ruby Foo's, but people there feel unintimidated enough to order sushi for the first time and to eat it with a fork.
Many of the men leading New York's restaurant groups admit they took their inspiration from Rich Melman of Chicago, whose Lettuce Entertain You revolutionized the idea of a chain with a different look and taste in every expansion. Mr. Melman started 25 years ago with restaurants like Lawrence of Oregano, and today he runs 70 places in five states and Japan with names like Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and Hat Dance and Scoozi. He has attributed his success to "the ability to give people what they want almost before they want it."
Always, the goal was not to replicate a style but to insinuate it, to infuse a sensibility. And so Mr. Nieporent can honestly say that "Nobu is not like Montrachet, and Montrachet is not like TriBeCa Grill." Yet, his one knockout success has a visionary chef behind it, Nobu Matsuhisa. Even so, Mr. Nieporent says that part of what made Nobu take off was that it made Japanese food accessible through its Westernized design. And the same designer, David Rockwell, is behind Ruby Foo's, which Mr. Hanson intends to clone in Times Square.
Zarela Martinez, the owner of Zarela and one of the dwindling number of successful independent restaurateurs in Manhattan, said the groups are able to cater to a vast contingent of restaurantgoers. As she put it: "There are two different groups of customers: people who go out to dine, and people who go out to eat. Those people want places that are not too challenging, where they don't have to make any judgments."
Mr. Nieporent makes much the same point. "When you try to cook on a very high level," he said, "the market is very small." Volume, from multiple restaurants with a variety of themes but the same underlying esthetic, is essential to success.
But what happened in New York to make it so receptive to high-end variations on a chain? Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group owns four highly rated restaurants, credits a boom in the economy and a change in perception. Ten years ago, he said, a fine restaurant was viewed as one where the chef lived upstairs and was on the premises 24 hours a day, like Andre Soltner at Lutece.
"It used to be thought that if you had a high-end restaurant and expanded, the second one would be a downscale version, or the first one would suffer," he said. "Now, we've learned that the opposite can be true." Diners flock to his newest restaurants, Eleven Madison Square and Tabla, with the certainty that they will have an experience on the level they would have had at his firstborn, Union Square Cafe.
As the city has prospered, museums and developers of hotels and luxurious office buildings have realized that restaurants are box-office attractions, Mr. Meyer said, and they seek out groups with a stellar track record. "They're looking for brand names," he said. Put another way, they want sure-hit studio movies and not dicey independent films.
Today, the places that work capitalize on cross-marketing. Crowds waiting for tables at Myriad's Next Door Nobu, which takes no reservations, are steered into the bar at Layla, the group's nearby Moroccan restaurant. Crowds lined up at Ruby Foo's can always jump into a cab to cross town and get sushi at Atlantic Grill. The trick is not to develop identical twins.
"You have to give New Yorkers their independence," said Mr. Hanson of BR Guest. "You can't negate that independence. My restaurants may have a common theme of seafood or pasta, but they're all different."
And yet, at heart they all have to be the same. A capsule review in Time Out New York of Blue Water Grill sums up the style perfectly: "sophisticated without being too daring." Just like New York now.
It's no surprise that Danny Meyer and Steve Hanson say they admire McDonald's and Starbucks. And maybe it's even less surprising to think of what's on the horizon under the Queensboro Bridge, a sprawling restaurant called Guastavino's. The man behind it is Sir Terence Conran, the most prolific restaurateur in London, whose stainless-steel and glass Bluebird "gastrodome" feels just like his huge seafood restaurant, Le Pont de la Tour, and his 700-seat Asian-esque place in Soho, Mezzo. After expanding to Paris, with a huge brasserie called Alcazar that looks air-dropped in from London, he's decided he'll take Manhattan.
And on the whole, I'd almost rather be in Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: A Bridge From Welfare

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is disappointing that Mayor Giuliani opposes a New York City Council proposal that would provide an alternative to the city's workfare program by creating hourly-wage jobs for former welfare recipients (news article, Sept. 29). 
 While the number of welfare participants has declined steeply as unemployment rates reach record lows, many welfare participants who failed to complete high school or who lack previous job experience have yet to find employment. These people are rapidly using up their five-year time limit on Federal welfare benefits.
Earlier this year, the New York Legislature agreed to give $13 million to finance a pilot job creation program to help such welfare participants make the transition to unsubsidized jobs. It is too bad that Mayor Giuliani opposes a similar program for the city that would help remove the real barriers impeding people from moving from welfare to work.

A Deadly Embrace

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
Flipping through the room-service menu at my Havana hotel the other morning, I noticed it listed four types of breakfast: American, Continental, Creole and Russian. Now, there aren't too many places in the world where you find "Russian breakfast" on the menu, especially this one, which consisted of caviar, smoked salmon and champagne for $125! Only a Russian businessman with an account at the Bank of New York could afford that breakfast.
Never mind. The Russian breakfast at the Melia Cohiba is among the few traces left in Cuba of the once-widespread Russian presence here. The huge, ugly Russian Embassy compound is so understaffed that a Russian diplomat here asked an American friend of mine, half-jokingly, whether he was interested in renting a room in the compound. It's a long way from the Cuban missile crisis. 
 For Russia today, Cuba is just another deadbeat country that owes the Kremlin billions of dollars. For Cuba's regime, though, Russia is something more. It is a fate to be avoided, a grim reaper to be outpaced. Fidel Castro's regime doesn't have much to boast about these days, but it will brag about this: "We didn't collapse with the Soviet Union!"
Indeed, I was given an official pamphlet entitled "The Cuban Miracle And Its Future." I figured it was about how Cuba had increased its sugar cane production. No. It was all about how Cuba survived the loss of $6 billion a year in Soviet aid, and why the Cuban people now "can smile at their hasty gravediggers."
In fact, Cuba's surviving the U.S.S.R.'s collapse is no miracle. It is the product of hard political realities that are worth examining. It starts with the old man. Unlike in Eastern Europe, Castro and his comrades are the original leaders of the Cuban revolution. They were the ones who seized power 40 years ago, and they will shoot to kill to preserve it. There will be no velvet revolution here.
Moreover, Cuba is an island, and it is easier than Eastern Europe to isolate from global trends. "You go into parts of Eastern Cuba and put your car radio onto 'scan' and it will just go round and round, without ever coming up with a station," remarked a Western diplomat here.
Also, while there are some dissidents still here, over the years most have left for Miami, been evicted or defected, so the protest movement lacks local leadership and is closely monitored. And one must admit that many of those Cubans who have stayed here, even those fed up with ration books, still have a grudging respect for Castro -- for the way he has given Cubans their own identity.
Finally, by opening Cuba a crack to tourism and foreign investment, the regime has been able to earn just enough cash to keep the place going without extensive political reform. This makes the daily struggle just to make ends meet all-consuming for Cubans. As P. J. O'Rourke once observed, Cuba is still so poor, and has so few cars, only a paranoid schizophrenic would look both ways before crossing a Havana street.
All this explains why it's time to start rethinking U.S. policy toward Cuba. In the cold war we were right to embargo Cuba because it posed a national security threat by its own strength and that of its Soviet backer. But today Castro's Soviet backer has collapsed, and the only threat that Cuba poses to us is if it suddenly collapses too or is convulsed in civil war after Castro is gone. If that happens, there will be real pressure for the U.S. to intervene militarily.
Forget about Castro. He's survived 40 years. He'll survive a few more. The real war now should be to make Cuba a viable society that slowly inches toward the West, not to keep it a weak and isolated society that inches only toward the abyss. Our strategic aim today shouldn't be to get Castro, but to save Cuba. A wise U.S. policy would be to lift the embargo and help Cubans gain the basic tools of economic growth, so that they can tune out Castro while he's still around, and thrive without Castro once he's gone.
I watched Castro on television the other night, addressing a student gathering. He was in his green uniform, fulminating at full throttle. The poor guy doesn't know the war is over. But then, how could he? We don't either. The U.S. and Cuban Governments have one thing in common today -- they're both ready to mortgage Cuba's future for its past.

HEADLINE: Rise in Average College Cost In '99 Is Lowest in 12 Years

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
The average cost of attending college this school year rose 4.6 percent at private institutions and 3.4 percent at public institutions, the lowest increases in at least 12 years but still higher than the national rate of inflation, the College Board reported yesterday.
The board, the nonprofit organization that administers the nation's most widely used standardized tests for college admission, calculated the average cost of tuition and fees at private four-year colleges this fall to be $15,380, an increase of $671 over the 1998-1999 school year. At public universities, the average cost this year is $3,356, an increase of $109. 
 When expenses for room and board, for students who live on campus, are added to the figures, the average cost of a private college education this year is $21,339, and a public university is $8,086.
Although the rate of increase has been slowing at public institutions since 1991, and at private colleges since 1988, neither has managed to hold the rise in costs to that of inflation, which was 2.3 percent in the 12-month period ended in August.
To Terry Hartle, senior vice president for the American Council on Education, which represents 2,000 colleges and universities, public and private, that lingering gap is a symptom of the pressures brought to bear on institutions of higher learning.
"Higher education is a labor-intensive enterprise," Mr. Hartle said. "Productivity gains come slowly. The kinds of things colleges could do to increase productivity -- larger class sizes, more junior professors, fewer seminars, less books in the library -- are not desirable."
Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, said: "Technology is expensive, laboratories are expensive, students' expectations of the quality of classrooms are expensive."
Nonetheless, Mr. Caperton said that a family's investment in higher education continued to offer the prospect of a handsome return, particularly because the average income of someone who goes to college is double that of someone who does not. "About 50 percent of people who go to college pay about $4,000 for fees and tuition, which is $16,000 over four years," he said. "If a person works for 40 years, they'll probably earn over $1 million on that $16,000."
To rein in their fees, colleges are using a variety of strategies: Clark University in Worcester, Mass., has begun using waste energy to heat and cool campus buildings; Middlebury College is increasing the size of its student body by 300 students over the next decade, and Northeastern University in Boston has reduced the size of its faculty by more than 17 percent over the last five years, through attrition and a voluntary buyout program, according to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.
When last year -- the 1998-1999 school year -- was compared with the previous year, the rate of increase in tuition and fees for private institutions was 5.2 percent, and that of public colleges was 4.2 percent. Until this year's survey, both were all-time lows since the College Board began its survey comparing tuition fees, in the 1987-1988 school year.
Over that period, the largest increase for private institutions, 9.2 percent, was recorded in the late 1980's, and the largest jump in public college tuitions, 12 percent, was measured in the early 1990's.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Finishes a Bit Lower After a Day of Big Swings

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In a session punctuated by the Federal Reserve's decision to leave short-term interest rates unchanged yesterday, stock prices climbed, then plunged and finally recovered to close almost where they started.
Technology stocks led the market higher early in the day on the conviction that a decision by the Fed to maintain rates at current levels would not be harmful. 
 But major averages began coming off their highs early in the afternoon and slid sharply after the Fed indicated that while it had not raised rates, it might well do so at its next policy-making meeting in November.
In the last hour of trading, stocks came off their lows, as traders stepped in to buy after prices fell.
But analysts said the comeback meant little. At the end of the day, the stock market remained vulnerable to the same factors that had been sources of worry for some time.
"People are still looking for leadership where there has been none for the past six months," said Michael Clark, head of United States stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "I don't think you can get any sustained momentum until questions about interest rates, the dollar and corporate profits get cleared up. The rational conclusion is that there are increased risks, and the market is adjusting for those risks."
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was at 10,400.59, down 0.64 point, or a hundredth of a percent. It was the smallest point move in the blue-chip index since February. In the course of the day, however, the Dow rose as much as 107 and fell as much as 124.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 3.25, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,301.35. The Nasdaq composite index, loaded with technology shares, did a bit better, rising 3.70, or a tenth of a percent, to 2,799.67. And the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks fell 0.6 point, also a tenth of a percent, to 426.01.
In advance of the Fed's meeting yesterday, most economists predicted that the central bank would not vote to raise rates; a rise would have been the third increase since June.
But with the economy continuing to expand at a rapid clip, expectations are building that a rate increase has merely been postponed until next month or early next year at the latest.
"It is highly likely that economic conditions in November will be arguing for a rate hike," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates. "The question is whether or not financial market liquidity concerns associated with Y2K will be strong enough to make the Fed wait until after year-end."
By and large, yesterday was a good day for big technology stocks.
America Online was the biggest gainer in the S.& P. 500, rising 4 3/8, to 113 1/2. Lucent Tecnologies gained 11 5/16, to 64 15/16. And Cisco Systems was up 1 1/8, to 71 5/8.
But a decline in oil prices and an earnings warning from Halliburton made it a bad day in the oil patch.
Halliburton was the biggest loser in the S.& P. 500, falling 5 1/4, to 34 1/2.
Schlumberger, another big oilfield service company, fell 3 7/16, to 58 5/16. Baker Hughes dipped 1 1/16, to 26 9/16.
Among oil stocks Exxon fell 1 3/16, to 72 3/16. BP Amoco fell 1 3/4, to 54 7/8. And Texaco lost 2 1/2, to 60 7/16.
It was also not a good day for telephone stocks.
In the wake of its agreement to acquire Sprint, MCI Worldcom fell 3 11/16, to 67 15/16. Sprint was off 2, to 58 7/8. Bell Atlantic slipped 3 15/16, to 65 9/16. But AT&T countered the trend, rising 1 1/4, to 45.

Selloff in Treasuries
By Reuters
Prices of Treasuries sold off sharply after the Fed announcement on interest rates.
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury fell 17/32, to 99 11/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.17 percent from 6.08 percent on Monday. The closing yield was the highest since Aug. 11, when it was at 6.21 percent.
"The market sold off," said Mario DeRose, fixed-income strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "It's going to be difficult to sustain any rally in Treasuries with the Fed implying that it is looking at these economic reports here, like the employment report on Friday, and that will go a long way toward determining what the Fed will do in November."

HEADLINE: After 23 Years, the Supreme Court Turns Again to the Limits on Campaign Contributions

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The Justices of the Supreme Court came face to face today with the legacy of the Court's performance on the matter of money and politics, hearing arguments in a case from Missouri that challenges the continued validity of the $1,000 contribution limits the Court last examined and upheld 23 years ago.
The case presents some of the same issues at the heart of the campaign finance debate now under way in Congress: how to safeguard the integrity of a political system awash in money while at the same time preserving the ability of candidates to raise enough money to get their message across and of voters to contribute to the candidates of their choice, activities that the Court has ruled are protected by the First Amendment rights of free speech and association. 
 Few of the Justices appeared content today with a campaign finance system that, as Justice Anthony M. Kennedy phrased it, "has become obsessed with raising money." Justice Antonin Scalia referred sardonically to what he called the "half a baby delivered up" by the Court in its 1976 decision, Buckley v. Valeo, in which the Court, while upholding limits on contributions, ruled that candidates had a free-speech right to spend unlimited amounts of their own money.
But despite the Justices' evident unhappiness with the current state of the law, there appeared to be little appetite on the Court for using this latest case as a springboard for a fundamental reappraisal, as politicians and others on both sides of the debate have urged.
"Most people assume, and I do, certainly, that someone making an extraordinarily large contribution gets something extraordinary in return," Justice David H. Souter said to D. Bruce LaPierre, a lawyer arguing that Missouri had not provided adequate justification for contribution limits that mirror those the Court upheld for Federal elections in the Buckley decision.
An adequate justification for Missouri's law, Justice Souter suggested, is that "we need a political system in which there is some basic level of confidence on the part of those governed."
The case is an appeal by Missouri, with the backing of the Clinton Administration, from a ruling by the Federal appeals court in St. Louis that invalidated the $1,000 limit that the state legislature adopted in 1994 for contributions in statewide elections. Adjusted for inflation, the limit was $1,075 when that court, for the Eighth Circuit, ruled late last year that inflation since Buckley v. Valeo had so eroded the value of $1,000 that the state limit was now too low to permit "meaningful participation in protected political speech and association." Since 1976, the value of $1,000 has shrunk to less than $400.
Although the state's appeal, Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963, reached the Court in time to have been heard and decided last spring, the Justices unaccountably delayed the argument until today. With a decision now not likely until next spring, the case has the potential to cause chaos in the midst of a Presidential election year should the Court agree with the Eighth Circuit: by affirming the decision of the appeals court, the Justices would in effect be nullifying the $1,000 limit on contributions to Federal candidates, a restriction that has been law since the campaign finance statutes were overhauled after the Watergate scandal a quarter-century ago.
The case presents both a narrow question and a more fundamental one. More narrowly, the question is whether some sort of inflation adjustment is constitutionally required so as to maintain political contributors in the position they held 23 years ago.
But more broadly the Eighth Circuit's approach to the question presents "a direct challenge to the continuing validity of Buckley," as Jay Nixon, Missouri's Attorney General, told the Court today. The reason is that the appeals court refused to accept the Supreme Court's assumption in 1976 that big political contributions were "inherently" tainted by the appearance of corruption, and instead demanded documented proof that there were actual problems that could be addressed only by the restrictions on speech that contribution limits necessarily entail. Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman told the Court that the Eighth Circuit's demand for empirical evidence of corruption was a "fundamental error."
Mr. LaPierre, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, argued in contrast that it would take only a modest step for the Court to uphold the Eighth Circuit. "All we're asking for is some evidence of some real problem," he said, before the legislature can be permitted to impose "significant limits on First Amendment interests."
Although the Supreme Court, in upholding the limits in the 1974 Federal campaign law, took account of the post-Watergate context in which the law was passed, "that does not mean the same conditions prevailed in Missouri in 1994," Mr. LaPierre said. He added that "it would be a mistake to view Buckley as the grandfathered governor of all $1,000 contribution limits."
Mr. LaPierre's client, Zev David Fredman, is a former candidate for Missouri state auditor who, along with a political action committee called Shrink Missouri Government, filed a lawsuit in 1998 to block the state election limits on the ground that they deprived an insurgent candidate of the ability to raise enough money for an effective campaign.
In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, the Republican National Committee, along with the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the leading opponent of campaign finance restrictions, argues that the Court should eliminate all contribution limits. The low limits favor incumbents and have led to an accelerating "money chase," the brief says.
On the other side, a bipartisan group of 22 senators and representatives are urging the Court not only to continue to uphold contribution limits but also to reconsider its view that expenditures cannot be limited. "The proven inaccuracy of the Buckley Court's substituted judgment about the electoral process demonstrates that refusing to defer to legislative judgments is unwise," the Justices were told by this group, which includes Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, sponsors of legislation that would overhaul the campaign finance system.
During the argument, Mr. Nixon, the Missouri Attorney General, was pressed by several Justices to explain the notion that big contributions can lead to a "perception of corruption," in a colloquy that veered into the realm of political philosophy.
"Is it corruption," Justice Kennedy asked, "for an official to mirror the views of the electorate just so he can get re-elected?"
No, Mr. Nixon replied.
"Not corruption, just cynicism," Justice Kennedy commented.
"That's not corruption, that's democracy," the Attorney General said.
At another point, when Mr. Nixon said the Court's approach to contribution limits "has stood the test of time," Justice Scalia challenged him in a tone of incredulity.
"It's stood the test of time?" the Justice repeated. "You mean there's great contentment and satisfaction with the campaign finance system?"
Mr. Nixon replied that the current system was better than any alternative. If the Court abandons Buckley v. Valeo, he said, it will lead "the vast majority of citizens to believe their government is literally up for sale."

HEADLINE: Not Insured, And Not Worried

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank; Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell University, is the author of "Luxury Fever" and co-author of "The Winner-Take-All Society."

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Last week we learned that poverty in the United States has been declining of late, but now we're told that the number of Americans without health insurance has risen to 44.3 million -- 833,000 more than a year ago and 4.5 million more than when Bill Clinton took office in 1993. Even in households with annual incomes of at least $50,000, the number of people without insurance increased last year, to 12.2 million.
In the midst of the longest sustained economic boom in history, with the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, how is it possible that the ranks of the uninsured keep swelling? 
 The simple answer is that millions of American families continue to experience day-to-day financial distress. Last year, for example, one of every 68 families filed for bankruptcy, more than the number of families with children graduating from college.
Under the circumstances, it is easy to see why many families that have enjoyed good health are tempted to press their luck. After all, health coverage for a family of four with no pre-existing medical conditions costs upward of $3,000 a year, which is almost always far more than what such a family spends on medical services. The extra cash could help pay for a move into a better school district, for example, or at least keep creditors at bay.
Of course, in the event of a catastrophic illness, the hoped-for savings would vanish, and then some. Yet many Americans ignore this possibility. In fact, most of us have an unwarranted, not to say preposterous, degree of optimism regarding our own future well-being.
Surveys reveal that we see ourselves as far more likely than our peers to earn large salaries in the future, for example, and far less likely to get divorced or suffer from lung cancer. We may know that some families will have health problems, but we don't think we'll be among them.
As more people cancel their health coverage, going without insurance becomes more socially acceptable. Parents who didn't buy health insurance for their families were once viewed as irresponsible, but this stigma inevitably loses its sting as the number of uninsured grows.
Making matters worse is the changing composition of the pool of the insured. As more healthy families forgo coverage, those left tend to be sicker and more costly to treat, forcing up premiums.
A similar dynamic is at work on the employer's side. Not long ago, many workers would never have considered a job that didn't include health insurance. As more employers, particularly small businesses, offer jobs with no coverage, however, it becomes more difficult for workers to avoid them. In turn, these employers have lower operating costs, allowing them a competitive edge and putting further pressure on businesses that continue to offer such benefits.
In short, our health-insurance system is in a death spiral. Despite President Clinton's effort to expand coverage for uninsured children, we now have more uninsured children than ever. Vice President Al Gore's plan to broaden children's coverage is only a marginal improvement. Former Senator Bill Bradley's proposal would substantially broaden coverage for both children and adults, but, as even he concedes, it probably would not be enough. Gov. George Bush has yet to weigh in on this issue.
The good news is that the Government could eliminate the death spiral by simply reimbursing each family up to $3,000 a year for health insurance. Government bureaucrats would not need to prescribe which doctors we see or micromanage any of the other details. They would simply process insurance receipts and send out reimbursement checks.
This plan sounds expensive, but would actually be far less costly than the current system. The principal savings would come from delivering more cost-effective care to those who are now uninsured.
As it stands now, the untreated minor illnesses of the uninsured often develop into major illnesses, which are far more costly to treat. And when such illnesses befall the uninsured, we almost always treat them, often in costly emergency rooms. The resulting burden on hospitals leads to higher fees and increased Government support -- both of which now come largely out of the pockets of high-income taxpayers with health insurance.
The total budget needed to finance a $3,000 health insurance reimbursement for every American family -- some $200 billion a year -- would obviously require higher taxes. But for those whose employers currently provide health insurance, these taxes would be offset by an increase in salaries.
After all, companies offer insurance not because they are charitable, but because they find doing so an effective way to compete for workers. Any company that did not offer higher salaries to previously insured workers would risk losing them to a company that did.
A universal reimbursement program would impose no net burden on taxpayers, because of both salary adjustments and reductions in the high cost of care for the uninsured. By providing a powerful incentive for all families to buy insurance, it would reverse the current downward spiral.
Critics of health-care reform will say that if some people want to save money by going without health insurance, that's their problem or their choice. Perhaps, but it's a problem for the rest of us as well, one that if left untended will grow steadily worse. Our unwillingness to deal with this problem is even more profoundly irrational than the uninsured family's belief in its immunity from serious illness.

HEADLINE: Biotech Companies Feel Overlooked by New York

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
For many years, New York City officials have turned a cold shoulder to the biotechnology industry, prompting entrepreneurs trained in prestigious local medical research institutions to set up their companies in more hospitable places, according to a number of scientists and others in the field.
The lack of city effort to encourage the industry has deprived New York of good jobs, lucrative businesses and increasingly generous Federal research dollars, these experts say. 
 City officials have long vowed to step up their efforts for biotechnology companies, which are risky and expensive to establish. But despite years of expectations, a new report has concluded that "New York has virtually no biotech industry to speak of."
The report, by the Center for an Urban Future, a Manhattan nonprofit research organization, says neglect by both the city and the state has allowed other states with generous incentive programs to siphon off good ideas from scientists at local medical research institutions.
Prominent figures in biomedicine echo those conclusions. "It's been an unfortunate oversight," said Dr. Herbert Pardes, the dean of the Columbia University Faculty of Medicine. "New York is a big, hectic city with a lot of competing pressures. But we certainly should be doing more in this area."
Just last week, for example, Thyreos, a company developing new cancer treatments, gave up on finding affordable space in the city and moved from a small midtown office to space in Newark that was once occupied by a chemical company. Dr. C. Wayne Bardin, the company president, said laboratory space in the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park at Columbia, the one place in the city dedicated to companies like his, cost too much.
Dr. Bardin, who was once based at Rockefeller University, contends that although New York has been generous with incentives to businesses in traditional industries like finance and publishing, it has been short-sighted about biotechnology. The industry develops vaccines, medicine and food products based on research in molecular and cellular biology and genetics, and getting the product to market can take as as long as a decade.
"New York is not geared to the small guy," Dr. Bardin said. "If my company grows to a a billion-dollar business, it will be a New Jersey business, not a New York business."
State and city officials, however, deny that they have ignored the biotechnology industry and point out that they have recently begun to take more aggressive steps to help these businesses. "I'm not about to say that we cannot do more to make a better climate for these sorts of industries to thrive," said Michael G. Carey, the new president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
But for Dr. Ron Cohen, who founded a company in 1995 to develop treatments for spinal cord injuries, the new focus is coming too late. At first, Dr. Cohen, a graduate of Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons, worked out of his Manhattan apartment, but as his company, Acorda Therapeutics, grew, he found himself squeezed out of the city by high rents.
So last year, Dr. Cohen traded proximity to major libraries and eminent scientists for a tree-lined industrial park in Hawthorne, about 25 miles north of New York. Baltimore officials also went to great lengths to win him, but personal ties kept him close to New York, he said.
"It wasn't just the incentives," Dr. Cohen said. "It was the confidence they gave that when it came to biotech, they got it. You felt you had a friend in Maryland."
In the 14 months since his company moved to Westchester, it has grown to 25 employees from 6.
In 1998, the last year for which figures are available, there were nearly 1,300 biotechnology companies in the nation, employing about 153,000 people.
But only 20 are in New York City, according to the New York Biotechnology Association, a trade group. Statewide, there are about 175 companies, most of them based on Long Island or outside the metropolitan area, said Karin A. Duncker, the association executive director.
The Center for an Urban Future report blames New York's medical establishment for being slow to develop the type of entrepreneurial spirit common to places where biotechnology has thrived.
But the harshest criticism is reserved for the Giuliani administration. In 1995, for example, the city established a $50 million venture capital fund to bolster companies in advanced technology. But the fund has yet to invest a dime in biotechnology. (Mr. Carey said that only 20 of the 1,500 proposals submitted to the fund came from biotechnology companies.)
And the report also faults state officials for no longer replenishing a revolving small-business fund that lends money to starting technology companies.
Pataki administration officials deny that they have been lax. "We have been promoting biotech research and investment for a number of years," said Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget, "and we now feel that we have a comprehensive strategy in place that is second to none."
Indeed, in recent years, the state has helped finance several biotechnology incubators, as work spaces where new companies are given a chance to get started are called. But that money has gone to State University campuses outside the city.
Ms. Duncker and other industry advocates say they are encouraged by some recent developments, including a new state law that allows individuals to write off investments in high-tech companies.
"Steps have been made," Ms. Duncker said, "Unfortunately, we have a long way to go."
Biotechnology has flourished for about two decades in California and Massachusetts, sometimes with government help and sometimes without. Cities like South San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore have converted old warehouses and military installations into incubators. More recently, other states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, have made major commitments to helping companies in their early stages.
The cost of outfitting laboratories alone is beyond the reach of small businesses without some form of public subsidy, said William A. Polf, a deputy vice president at Columbia's Health Sciences Division.
But Dr. Jeremy M. Levin, the managing director of Perseus Capital, a company that invests in biotechnology, said each industry job generated at least five other local jobs -- from people who supply chemicals, material and animals for research to others who dispose of hazardous materials.
The city's sole incubator, the well-maintained Audubon Park, occupies five floors in the Mary Woodard Lasker Medical Research Building in Washington Heights. It has room for only about a dozen companies and turns away an average of one prospective tenant each month, said Mitchell Gipson, Audubon's executive director. As companies expand, they are forced to move elsewhere, and often leave the city.
Since becoming an Audubon tenant in June 1998, Memory Pharmaceuticals Corporation has grown to a work force of 25 from 5. Next year, the company, which is developing treatments for memory disorders, plans to move to Montvale, N.J., said Joanne Leonard, its chief financial officer.
Memory Pharmaceuticals found cheaper space and a rich package of incentives across the river.
New Jersey also created a fund to provide seed money for new businesses and will open a new state-financed technology center in North Brunswick this fall. New Jersey now has 100 biotech companies, twice what it had five years ago.
Nevertheless, in New York, the state and city are moving in the right direction, biotechnology entrepreneurs say. The state is creating a new Office of Science, Technology and Academic Research and has recommended that $250 million of the $110 billion state employees' pension fund be invested in high technology, including biotech companies.
The city has promised that some of the money set aside last month for a new $25 million Emerging Industries Fund would be used to finance biotechnology companies. Dr. Pardes, the Columbia dean, is chairman of a task force created by the Giuliani administration that will seek ways of expanding laboratory space and reducing regulatory roadblocks.
While the city seeks to catch up, a cluster of biotech companies founded by New Yorkers has already sprung up in Tarrytown, on the site of a plant that once belonged to Union Carbide.
Jonathan Bowles, the research director of the Center for an Urban Future and the author of its biotechnology report, said that that cluster was a good example of how the city had failed.
"Why couldn't it be in the Bronx, where the city could get something from it?" Mr. Bowles asked. "Just like we want Bear Stearns to stay in Manhattan, we want these companies' revenue and employees to be here."

Sales of Industrial Robots Up, Report by a U.N. Agency Says

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Sales of industrial robots are flourishing worldwide, except in Asia, because of a huge demand from car makers in the United States and Europe, a United Nations economic agency said today.
In the first half of 1999, motor vehicle manufacturers' orders surged 101 percent worldwide, and 214 percent in North America, compared with the same period in 1998, the agency, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, said in an annual survey. 
 It predicted that by 2002, the pace of industrial robot installations would be up 36 percent over that in 1998, in part because of increasing domestic use of service robots for such tasks as lawn mowing and vacuum cleaning.
Plummeting sales in Japan and South Korea caused the world robotic market to decline by 16 percent last year, according to figures compiled by the commission and the International Federation of Robotics, a trade group based in Sweden.
Japan, the United States, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Korea, France and Britain were the leaders in the number of industrial robots installed last year.
The pace is predicted to pick up this year, the agency said, with yearly average growth of 8 percent until 2002, when 97,000 units are projected for installation. But this is a significantly lower forecast compared with previous agency predictions. The report said that in Asian markets, "previously good conditions for robot investment have come to a halt -- at least temporarily."
Despite downturns in 1996 and 1998, the United States market for robots is again flourishing, with orders up 90 percent in the first half of 1999 compared with the 1998 period, according to the report.
The European market increased by 10 percent last year, and is projected to be much stronger this year based on a 32 percent increase in orders in the first six months. Denmark, Finland and Spain led the way with growth of 50 percent or more.
No growth is expected in Japan this year, but some recovery is forecast by 2002, when annual installations are expected to total 43,000, the report said. Before the "bubble economy" burst in the early 1990's, Japan had installed a large number of robots, many of which are likely to be replaced.
The United States is expected to increase its industrial robot installations by an average of 9 percent yearly, to an annual 15,600 units by 2002. Robot installations in Europe are anticipated to grow by 10 percent annually, to 32,000 robots in 2002.
Among the new markets for robots are the United States Postal Service, where as many as 80,000 could be installed in the next two decades, the report said. Large increases in robot use are also foreseen for household tasks, medical use and as aids to people with physical disabilities.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Triangulation

 BODY:
Perhaps emboldened by his lead in the Republican Presidential race, George W. Bush has delivered a surprising critique of his party and, implicitly, its Congressional leadership. Yesterday, while campaigning in New York, the Texas Governor blamed fellow Republicans for what he said was an overly obsessive focusing on the economy at the expense of social needs. As if on cue, Republicans in Congress let it be known that despite the big Federal surpluses, they were considering budget cuts that could eviscerate Head Start, school aid for poor students, health research and other programs.
Mr. Bush's latest comments came less than a week after the uproar over his bluntly accurate assessment of a House Republican scheme to rescind part of the Federal tax credit for working-class families. "I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs of the poor," he said, a comment tailor-made for Democrats and certain to be played back between now and the election. 
 The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert responded calmly, suggesting they believe that Mr. Bush is simply running toward the center for tactical reasons. "Sometimes I take shots at Congress too," said Mr. Lott. Still, one has to wonder if they do not miss the days when Mr. Bush was on Capitol Hill assuring G.O.P. lawmakers that he would not try to score points by bashing Republicans in Congress. Now the Governor seems to be stealing a page from the old Dick Morris "triangulation" playbook, in which President Clinton ran for re-election by distancing himself from the Congressional Democrats.
They should also worry that in defining "compassionate conservatism," Mr. Bush is underlining real weaknesses in the G.O.P.'s Congressional program. On the budget, for example, Republicans are blindly attached to the tight ceilings that they enacted with White House concurrence two years ago. The Republicans have also vowed, along with the White House, not to use any money generated by the Social Security program to pay for regular programs, even though budgets have resorted to that practice for decades.
Mr. Clinton has proposed raising money for vital programs by closing tax loopholes and imposing a modest tobacco tax. The Republicans rejected that approach and employed gimmicks to meet the budget targets. But even with gimmicks, it will take cuts to meet the ceilings enacted in 1997. What would have been a difficult job on the budget has now been made even harder for the Republicans by Mr. Bush. His critique almost seems to echo the view of President Clinton, Vice President Gore and the Democrats, who portray the G.O.P. in Congress as hijacked by anti-government extremists.
Tom DeLay and the other hard-line Congressional Republicans are telling each other that young Mr. Bush has a lot to learn about Washington. But maybe it is the Republicans in Congress who have a lot to learn from Governor Bush, who has actually had to administer social programs and may have come to the radical conclusion that it takes money to run them adequately. In trying to head off unrealistic Republican budget cuts, the White House may have found an unlikely ally.

HEADLINE: Fed Leaves Rates Steady, For This Time

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, but warned that it was still concerned about the potential for inflation and might raise rates soon if the economy did not cool off.
Economists and investors had expected the central bank's decision not to change the short-term rates it controls. But the Fed's warning about its possible next move -- in the form of a formal tilt toward a tighter monetary policy -- nonetheless jolted Wall Street and suggested that financial markets would remain jittery in coming weeks in anticipation of new data about the momentum of the economy. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up over 100 points just before the Fed's announcement, plummeted immediately and was down around 125 points before rebounding. It closed at 10,400.59, down 0.64 point on the day. Bond prices tumbled, sending longer-term interest rates higher.
In holding rates steady for now but putting investors on notice that a rate increase could be in the offing, the Fed was trying to strike a policy balance that acknowledged both the warning signals of inflation being generated by the robust economy and the almost total lack of actual inflation outside of surging oil prices.
"They had pretty much telegraphed that they weren't going to raise interest rates this time, but they are certainly leaving their options open to do so in the future," said David Wyss, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI, a consulting firm. "They have a feeling that the economy may be doing too well for its own good."
Fed officials, led by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, have become increasingly convinced in recent months that the economy's capacity to grow without inflation has been substantially improved by huge investments in efficiency-enhancing computers and other technology.
Yet they have not abandoned their traditional rules and models, which hold that the economy cannot sustain the current combination of 4 percent annual growth and unemployment of just 4.2 percent without setting off an inflationary spiral of rising prices and wages.
"Strengthening productivity growth has been fostering favorable trends in unit costs and prices, and much recent information suggests that these trends have been sustained," the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement after its meeting today. "Nonetheless, the growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply, as evidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers willing to take jobs."
Under those circumstances, the committee said, the Fed "will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures."
The committee said its adoption of a bias toward raising rates in the future "did not signify a commitment to near-term action" and that it would study economic data and the state of the financial markets in coming weeks before making a decision.
After long keeping decisions to adopt a policy bias a secret, the Fed has been disclosing them immediately after each meeting since earlier this year, prompting considerable confusion in the markets as to whether a bias is all but a promise of a change in policy or just an alert.
In this case, analysts said that if economic reports in coming weeks showed a decline in unemployment, an increase in wages exceeding productivity increases or signs of continuing robust demand in key sectors like housing, the Fed could push rates up as soon as its next meeting on Nov. 16.
The Fed has already pushed its benchmark Federal funds target rate up twice this year in quarter- point steps, to 5.25 percent. Its more symbolic discount rate stands at 4.75 percent.
Fed officials are likely to pay particular attention to the employment report for September, which will be released on Friday, and the report for October, which will be released on Nov. 5.
"The implication is that if the numbers continue the way they have been recently and the stock market doesn't do anything dramatic, then the Fed will probably tighten again in November," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan in New York.
The Fed's two rate increases this year have helped push up long-term rates and consumer loan rates. The housing market in particular -- a key component of economic activity -- is feeling the pinch of higher rates, with higher mortgage rates ending a surge in refinancing activity and starting to crimp home sales, which had been running at record levels.
The decline over the last several months in the stock market should also help take some steam out of consumer confidence and demand, analysts said.
But in some ways the economy is strengthening, with manufacturers, for example, benefiting from an increase in exports as demand from Asia and Europe rebounds.
"There is some slowing in housing and some slowing in consumption, but it's not very dramatic yet," Mr. O'Sullivan said. "In the other direction, exports are accelerating, there's no weakening in business investment and inventories seem poised for an increase."
Today's statement did not mention the possible effects on the economy and the financial system of any widespread problems that might be caused by the Year 2000 computer software problem. Earlier this year, analysts had speculated that the Fed might have to put monetary policy on hold the last several months of the year regardless of inflation pressures to avoid adding to any problems that technology might be causing in the markets or the financial system.
But analysts said the Fed was now more confident that the computer problems would be contained, and that it could raise rates in November if economic conditions require it.

HEADLINE: Fliers From Transit Union Draw on Class Distinctions

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Class warfare has largely disappeared from New York's labor scene, but the Transit Workers Union has embraced it with a vengeance in its campaign for a new contract.
The union, representing 35,000 subway and bus workers, is distributing hundreds of thousands of copies of a novel leaflet with a cartoon of a huge, furry, fat cat dressed in a charcoal pin-striped suit and holding a fistful of hundred-dollar bills. 
 In militant language more common in the 1930's than the 1990's, the leaflets insist that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki have starved the transit system of funds by giving billions of dollars in tax breaks to corporations, an act deemed "corporate welfare."
The leaflets, which are being distributed under front doors and at subway stops, call for an end to "feeding the fat cats and subsidizing welfare cheats in corporate suites."
Willie James, president of Local 100 of the Transit Workers Union, said his union hired a well-known public relations consultant, Ray Rogers, to turn up the heat on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and on the Mayor and the Governor, who have a large say in its operations.
Mr. Rogers is famous for his strident language and hard-hitting techniques. Mr. James said that the union was paying him $100,000 to run the campaign and that printing 1 million leaflets would cost another $100,000.
"I was interested in a different approach," said Mr. James, who is facing complaints from many union members that their current contract gave them skimpy raises. "I knew I had to get the attention of the riding public and all parties concerned to show we're serious about getting a fair and just contract."
The union began distributing the leaflets this week, a few days after Mr. James threatened that transit workers might strike when their contract expires on Dec. 15. Under New York State law, it is illegal for public employees to strike, but Mr. James recognizes that city officials fear a December strike because it could cause chaos during the peak shopping season.
Mr. James said the union, whose members have an average salary of $39,000 a year, was intent on receiving a larger raise than it got in the current contract: a single raise of 3.75 percent. He is trying to build public support for the union, asserting that with the city, state and transit authority enjoying surpluses and an economic boom, transit workers should receive their fair share.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Rogers said the leaflets' sharp language was meant to rally support for more spending on public services, not just on transit, but also on schools and health care. At the same time, he said, the leaflets are designed to whip up opposition to tax breaks that he says are cheating the public and leaving too little money for transit and other services.
"In New York City," he said, "as you step over homeless people every day, you have to ask, 'Why are the Mayor and the Governor giving away billions of dollars to super-rich corporations and their greedy C.E.O.'s?' "
In particular, Mr. Rogers condemned tax breaks given to NBC, the Disney Corporation and the New York Stock Exchange. He suggested that the companies that demanded tax breaks to keep their operations in New York were extortionists.
Mr. Rogers' militant language and tactics helped the textile workers' union win a famous, decadelong unionization drive at J.P. Stevens in one of the most successful efforts at organizing industrial workers in the South. But his hardball tactics came under severe criticism when a union local representing meat-packing workers in Minnesota was crushed in a lengthy strike against Hormel.
M.T.A. officials did not take kindly to the leaflets and said the authority hoped to reach an amicable settlement with the transit workers.
Asked to comment on Mr. Rogers's leaflets, Tom Kelly, an M.T.A spokesman, said: "He's a paid consultant. He's earning his money."
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, denounced the leaflets. "It's a shame that the union's leadership has decided to spend hard-earned union dues on its own self-promotion and self-aggrandizement," he said. "It seems like a waste of the union members' money, particularly since the negotiations have not yet begun. If they're interested in reaching a fair settlement, that will be done at the table, not by spending a lot of money on a spin meister."
Mayor Giuliani's press office did not respond to telephone calls.

HEADLINE: Wealthy Nassau Makes Itself a Fiscal Mess

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., Oct. 3

 BODY:
From the quaintest village hall to the largest county seat, in Albany, Trenton and Washington, governments at every level of society are enjoying record surpluses amassed during the nation's long economic expansion.
So it would be natural to expect that Nassau County, one of the wealthiest and most populous in America, run for a generation by a party espousing fiscal conservatism, and now possessed of its lowest rate of unemployment in decades, would have put together a sizable budget surplus. 
 Instead, while other comparable counties are pondering tax cuts or new spending, this storied suburb -- inspiration for Fitzgerald's Gold Coast, launching point for Lindbergh and playpen of the Long Island Lolita -- is contemplating something else: a deficit that reached $300 million this summer and bonds downgraded to a level now hovering just above junk.
How this happened is an unlikely tale, a product of Nassau's one-party politics and some disastrous financial decisions by the county's Republican leaders. But with elections a month away, it is giving local Democrats their first hope in years of changing the political balance of power. And, experts on municipal finance say, it is making Nassau County a serious contender to be labeled the most fiscally irresponsible county in America.
"I've been doing this 22 years," said John J. Hallacy, the manager of municipal research at Merrill Lynch, one of Nassau's frequent underwriters, when asked if he had ever seen a government with so much going for it encounter so much financial trouble. "An example doesn't really come to mind."
Even Orange County, Calif., which went bankrupt in 1994 after losing $2 billion on bad investments, saw its bond rating elevated to the second-highest category last month. Nassau, alone among major urban counties, is heading in the opposite direction.
Three factors helped create the crisis, which developed over the last decade.
It began with the way an overriding aversion to electoral setbacks produced increasingly risky financial decisions by the county's Republican executive and legislative majority. An impotent and impossibly divided Democratic Party often held its tongue.
In addition, an apathetic and uninformed electorate saw no reason to doubt Republican assurances that things were just fine.
The climax came suddenly. In short order this year, delays in the budgeted sales of several county assets and a $50 million cost overrun in the health insurance plan for county workers opened up a widening deficit. Seeing no other solution, Wall Street rating agencies that had issued increasingly stern warnings for months finally lowered the county's bond rating and hinted at further rebukes to come.
Now, Nassau's Republican organization, widely considered the strongest surviving Tammany-style political machine in the country, is behaving as if its survival is in doubt. Republican candidates for the County Legislature in next month's elections are treating their veto-proof 14-to-5 majority as the slimmest of margins, spending more than $1 million on television ads and mailings, twice as much as in calmer years.
"It's serious, no question about it," said Joseph N. Mondello, who as county chairman is one of the most powerful Republican officials in the state. "My personal poll is when I go to my deli in Levittown, or my church. Levittown's a lower socioeconomic group of folks. They've always been strong Republican supporters. I've begun to see signs that that support could be wavering."
In retrospect, what is most surprising about the county's fiscal spiral is how long it took to occur.
The County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, who took office in 1987, has depicted himself as a conservative fiscal manager who would nonetheless be able to maintain the lavishly paid police force, pristine parks and golf courses, and other services residents had grown to expect.
But Mr. Gulotta set off a firestorm of criticism when he proposed a 25 percent property tax increase to close a deficit in 1992.
Scalded by a close re-election fight the next year, Mr. Gulotta seemed to experience a conversion. His budgets from then on avoided the slightest increase in the general tax rate. And, although Nassau has the nation's highest sales-tax rate, and while property taxes tied to specific purposes, like the police or parks, continued to go up, Mr. Gulotta's mantra -- that he had cut or frozen the county's general-fund property tax for the Nth straight year -- won him a landslide re-election for a third full term in 1997.
But the costs of county government did not stop rising. For example, refunds to taxpayers who win appeals of their property assessments now exceed $100 million a year. Yet the county is defending its assessment system against a lawsuit by the Federal Government, which says it results in higher taxes for black and Hispanic residents in poor neighborhoods, as if their homes were as valuable as those in wealthier, mostly white neighborhoods.
Moreover, unlike Westchester County, which sets aside money for such claims in each year's operating budget, Nassau borrows to pay for the refunds. As a result, its ballooning debt, now at $2.5 billion, is more than twice as much per capita as that of any other county in the state.
Westchester, which is perennially given the highest ratings by Wall Street agencies, has frequently raised its property tax rate in small steps. But to avoid any such pain, critics say, Mr. Gulotta routinely used two simple gimmicks to close the gap between rising costs and property taxes.
He projected the sale of county assets, though they often failed to be sold on time, or at all. And he overestimated the county's sales tax receipts, even when they were on the rise. Westchester has routinely underestimated sales taxes.
Now, as New York City and Suffolk County are about to eliminate the sales tax on clothing, Nassau cannot afford to do so, meaning many consumers could be driven elsewhere. A cooling economy could bode even worse for sales taxes -- and mean even bigger deficits.
Mr. Gulotta now acknowledges his failure to keep property taxes and other recurring revenues on a par with spending. But he does not call that a mistake. In an interview, he first played down the importance of, and then took issue with, the downgrade of the county's bond rating, saying it had been "premature."
Instead, he contended that the years of property tax cuts had been partly responsible for the county's high wealth levels and booming economy. "It's true that it's had the side impact of creating a structural imbalance in the budget," he said. "I feel we are addressing it now in a responsible fashion."
Whether they were right all along or not, Mr. Gulotta and the Republican legislators who approved his budgets each year essentially had a free hand in running the county, for two reasons: the opposition was powerless to stop them, and the public paid little attention.
Democrats, always the underdog in county elections, were hampered even further by more than a decade of leadership battles and constant petty infighting. That finally came to an end in March, when Stephen J. Sabbeth, convicted of bankruptcy fraud, resigned as Democratic chairman and was replaced by Thomas P. DiNapoli, a youthful Assemblyman from Great Neck.
"The people of this county, because they only vote one way, they've contributed to the lack of accountability," Mr. DiNapoli said. "In any normal political situation, this is the year for a landslide for the opposition."
The growing turmoil in Mineola may be stirring the public from its complacency.
Hundreds of county officials, including the sheriff, the county attorney, several department heads and other close aides to Mr. Gulotta have put in their early retirement papers in recent days, creating the impression of a sinking ship. Long Island cable television stations are running dueling ads by Mr. Gulotta (who is not up for re-election until 2001) and Republican legislators, in which both he and the Legislature's presiding officer, Bruce A. Blakeman, independently promise to solve the fiscal crisis while avoiding any mention of their roles in causing it.
Mr. Gulotta's commercials appear to have so frustrated the Republican legislators' attempts to distance themselves from him that they have begun to attack him more directly, theatrically shredding a copy of his budget at one recent news conference and vowing to remake it entirely over the next few weeks.
For the first time in memory, the Republicans even acknowledged the existence of political patronage, promising to cut the pay and maybe even the jobs of appointed deputy commissioners, secretaries and others -- whose salaries Democrats have charged bloat the county payroll by millions of dollars.
Happily watching from the sidelines are Democrats like Mr. DiNapoli, who have been trying to cast the November election as a referendum on Republicans' stewardship of county government. They concede that they would be grateful to pick up just two legislative seats, enough to give them the power to block the county from borrowing money, an essential bit of leverage.
Anything more, 25 years of Nassau politics teaches, would be all but unthinkable. Yet Democratic candidates suddenly seem to be getting at least a second look.
In Massapequa Park, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by a ratio of 5 to 2, a magazine editor named Carl Lowe is running as a Democratic sacrificial lamb against Peter J. Schmitt, the deputy presiding officer of the Legislature.
The other afternoon, Mr. Lowe knocked on nine Republican doors and a single Democratic one along Glengarriff Road. He collected 10 signatures for a petition supporting the Democratic fiscal oversight plan.
Ed Quinn, a retired New York police lieutenant and a lifelong Republican, rolled his eyes and practically sneered at Mr. Lowe when he identified himself as a Democrat. But as the two men spoke, Mr. Quinn's demeanor quickly changed.
"The whole country's doing terrific, and we're doing terrible," Mr. Quinn said. "They've really screwed it up pretty good."
Two doors down, Wendy Cannella, the Republican wife of a Republican county court officer, said she was giving the Democrats another look. "Why isn't this happening all over?" she asked. "Why just Nassau County?"
Maybe a new batch of county legislators would shake things up, Ms. Cannella said. "Gulotta's an easy target," she said. "But if he's screwed up this badly, what about the rest of them? Where were they?"

Sprint's News Shakes Up Kansas City

BYLINE: By TONI CARDARELLA 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 5

 BODY:
Just days after the dedication of a $920 million headquarters complex in Kansas, the Sprint Corporation spent today issuing reassurances that its pending acquisition by MCI Worldcom Inc. would not lead to substantial cutbacks in its operations in the Kansas City area.
With 18,000 of its 70,000 employees in and around Kansas City, Sprint is the area's second-largest employer, behind the Federal Government. MCI Worldcom, the second-biggest long-distance telephone company in the United States, announced today in New York that it would buy Sprint, the No. 3 carrier, for $115 billion in stock. If approved, it would be the biggest corporate takeover ever. 
 As information trickled in, government and business leaders expressed concern mixed with optimism.
Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer of Kansas, who also serves as the state's Secretary of Commerce and Housing, said, "For the Kansas economy I'm obviously concerned, and more importantly for the men and women who work out there."
Peter Levi, president of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, said he found comfort in the announcement that William T. Esrey, the chief executive of Sprint, would be chairman of the new company and would remain in Kansas City. Sprint's new headquarters are in Overland Park, Kan.
"Having his feet planted in Kansas City is very important to our community," said Mr. Levi, adding that he hoped that Sprint would remain a philanthropic force. Sprint is the third-largest donor to the new Science City project at Union Station and a major contributor to the Kansas City Zoo.
The communications industry accounts for about $2 billion of the area's estimated $55 billion gross regional product, said David Reisdorph, a senior researcher at the Mid-America Regional Council. "And obviously," he said, "Sprint has the lion's share of that."

HEADLINE: Priest vs. 'Big Chicken' In Fight for Labor Rights

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Del.

 BODY:
It was an incongruous sight, the white-haired priest in black shirt and white collar, standing in an immense poultry house filled with thousands of clucking birds and the acrid stench of manure.
The priest, the Rev. Jim Lewis, was in this unlikely place because the Episcopal Church has assigned him an unlikely mission: to improve the lives of Delaware's chicken farmers and poultry plant workers. 
 Father Lewis says his work is akin to that of the Old Testament prophets who railed against injustices, but the state's powerful poultry industry describes him as a one-man plague.
Day after day, as he muddies his feet in manure meeting with embittered farmers and poultry workers, Father Lewis harbors no doubt that he is doing the Lord's work in confronting an industry he calls Big Chicken.
"My big beef with Big Chicken is it's a greedy industry," said Father Lewis, who is based in this southern Delaware town at the hub of the region's poultry industry. "Greed is a good old-fashioned spiritual concern."
This hard-driving clergyman, a former marine and former all-state football player, has earned the industry's opprobrium by preaching against its ways, skewering it for driving too hard a bargain with chicken farmers and workers who spend hour after hour hacking away at chicken parts in cold, damp plants.
During many of the sermons he is invited to give at churches up and down the Delaware and Maryland shore, he tosses pieces of chicken out into the congregation, and asks, "Can you see the fingerprints that are on this chicken?"
Through his unusual ministry, Father Lewis, 64, has earned a reputation among religious leaders as a leading practitioner of a growing trend in which hundreds of American priests, ministers and rabbis are using their pulpits and moral stature to fight for workers, especially those on the bottom rungs.
Often his ministry seems equal parts caring and daring. He has formed an unusual multiracial alliance of plant workers, farmers and environmentalists to stand up to the powerful industry. He once angered union, industry and church leaders by helping lead a wildcat strike against a poultry plant where a worker was fired after he had a finger cut off.
He has condemned poultry companies for not providing health insurance to chicken catchers, who have the dangerous job of cramming thousands of chickens into cages each day before they are shipped to slaughter. He organized a one-day visit by five members of Congress, who heard workers complain of injuries from chopping chickens all day long and of wages so low that they qualified for welfare.
Father Lewis's coalition, the Delmarva Poultry Justice Alliance, has become one of the most powerful voices in one of the nation's leading poultry areas, the Delmarva Peninsula in eastern Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, which produces 3 billion pounds of chicken each year thanks to the peninsula's 2,700 chicken farms, 11 poultry-processing plants and 15,000 poultry workers.
The alliance includes African-American chicken catchers, Hispanic slaughterhouse workers and white chicken farmers who say poultry companies like Perdue Farms squeeze them so hard that they barely break even. It also includes environmentalists who say the mountains of chicken manure the industry produces are fouling the Chesapeake Bay and nearby rivers.
George Cmael, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental group, said: "Rev. Lewis is something else. He has the ability to tell a compelling story and to bring what others may view as disparate interests together."
When Father Lewis stopped in at Carole Morison's farm in Pocomoke City, Md., while doing his alliance-building, she gave him an earful about the poultry corporations.
The industry exploits her by not paying enough for her chickens, she said. She complained that her family farm had lost money the past two years, after she and her husband invested $220,000 to build two 500-foot-long chicken houses a decade ago. To make ends meet, her husband has had to take a full-time job with a farm equipment dealer.
Perdue periodically gives her 54,000 chicks a day old. Then over seven weeks she raises them to be five-pound broilers. Perdue pays her 16 cents a bird, after subtracting the cost of Perdue-supplied chicken feed and medicine.
Mrs. Morison, who lives with her husband and son in a $20,000 trailer, said Perdue also required her to spend $30,000 on a metal manure shed to reduce the runoff of manure into nearby streams.
"The manure shed is worth more than the house we live in because I can't afford more for a house," she said.
Mrs. Morison said Perdue Farms also told her to install a $15,000 drinking system for her chickens, adding that if she did not agree, she risked losing her contract and being blackballed by the industry. To add insult to financial injury, she said Perdue's engineers declared that system obsolete three years after she installed it.
"It's indentured servitude, that's what it is," she said. "This is a David and Goliath situation, and the poultry alliance has given us a voice to help level the playing field."
Father Lewis first showed up at the Morisons' door in 1995, soon after the Episcopal Bishop of Delaware hired him. That bishop, Cabell Tennis, now retired, said he wanted Father Lewis to help those working in the chicken industry, to go beyond giving care and charity and to work to change social structures in a way that would help eliminate poverty.
But industry officials often accuse Father Lewis of being deaf to their side of the story. Bill Satterfield, executive director of the Delmarva Poultry Industry Association, said, "The church certainly has a role in improving the quality of life, but they're not the only ones who have concerns about the quality of life."
He said only a small minority of chicken growers supported the alliance. Father Lewis countered that many growers supported it but were too intimidated to speak out.
Perdue asked Mr. Satterfield to respond on its behalf. He called Father Lewis's attacks inflammatory and often inaccurate. "The industry is providing employment to thousands of people and is helping feed the world with a safe product," he said. "I don't understand what he means when he says we're a greedy industry. Our industry pays a competitive wage. They hire people who otherwise would be unemployed. Many Hispanic workers come to this area because of the opportunities this industry has provided."
Bishop Tennis sounded pleased and vindicated by these complaints. "If I were the industry I'd probably have those feelings," he said. "That's just another way of saying, 'We're uncomfortable.' The church's function is to make institutions uncomfortable. If we weren't making ourselves and others uncomfortable, we're probably not doing our job."

HEADLINE: Bush Says G.O.P. Stresses Wealth At Expense of Tackling Social Ills

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas used a speech about his proposals for improving education yesterday to issue a pointed critique of the Republican Party, saying it had put too much emphasis on economic wealth and too little on social problems.
It was the second time in less than a week that Mr. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, had cast many fellow Republicans as insensitive and had seemed to be establishing some distance from them. Last Thursday, Mr. Bush accused House Republicans of trying to "balance the budget on the backs of the poor." 
Yesterday, addressing hundreds of people in a hotel in midtown Manhattan, the Governor digressed somewhat from a discussion of his education proposals, including a major expansion of charter schools, to offer a sort of apology for the priorities that many Republicans have set and for the image they have projected.
"Too often, my party has focused on the national economy, to the exclusion of all else, speaking a sterile language of rates and numbers, C.B.O. and G.N.P.," Mr. Bush said, referring to the Congressional Budget Office and the gross national product.
"Of course we want vigor and growth in our economy," the Governor continued. "But there are human problems that persist in the shadow of affluence. And the strongest argument for conservative ideals -- for responsibility and accountability and the virtues of our tradition -- is that they lead to greater justice, less suffering, more opportunity."
Mr. Bush's usual stump speech and his public remarks almost always feature the assertion that he is a new kind of Republican -- a "compassionate conservative," to use his slogan. Again and again, he advocates "prosperity with a purpose" and declares that "prosperity alone is simple materialism."
But any rebuke to fellow Republicans is usually implicit. Mr. Bush's comments yesterday veered toward the confrontational, and the reprimand was decidedly explicit. He seemed to challenge fellow Republicans not only to look beyond the bottom line when assessing the state of the nation, but also to devote as much energy to problem solving as to stern moralizing.
"Too often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of America slouching toward Gomorrah," the Governor said.
A few sentences later, in another swipe at his fellow Republicans, Mr. Bush added, "Too often, my party has confused the need for limited government with a disdain for government itself."
Mr. Bush's speech was the second of three that he plans to deliver this year on education, an issue that he is making a cornerstone of his campaign. And in it, he outlined a plan for the Federal Government to give states much more discretion over how they spend Federal dollars, to create financial incentives for states to improve student performance and to pave the way for the proliferation of charter schools.
Mr. Bush's support of charter schools extended to a promise that if he is elected President, he will allocate $300 million over two years to guarantee $3 billion worth of private loans for the establishment of new charter schools.
With that proposal and others, Mr. Bush was advocating an increase in Federal spending on education, a commitment sure to displease some conservative Republicans.
His critical appraisal of some of them came during a campaign swing through a state that has favored the Democratic nominee in the last three Presidential elections. To compete effectively in New York, Governor Bush may well have to appeal to moderate Democrats.
Karen P. Hughes, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, said that he was merely continuing to flesh out the meaning of compassionate conservatism and that it was mostly coincidental that he was doing so in New York.
Another adviser to Mr. Bush said that the Governor spoke out so forcefully on this occasion because he sensed that Republicans lacked credibility on the issue of education and that he wanted his thoughts and concerns to be taken seriously.
"Stylistically and thematically," said the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, "he's saying, 'I'm not like a lot of Republicans you've gotten used to hearing from and who seem willing to throw in the towel on your schools.' "
"In the past, our message has been one of abolishing the Department of Education," the adviser continued, referring to the Republican Party. "Let's face it: if you look at the polls, we're badly trailing the Democrats on this issue."
Even so, Mr. Bush's remarks about the Republican Party drew fresh attention to the question of what sort of relationship will develop between Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans, who arguably have a greater interest in being associated with him than he does in being linked to them.
Some expressed anger last week after Mr. Bush expressed his opposition to their plan to balance the budget by spreading out payments of a tax credit, usually given in one lump sum, that primarily benefits working-class Americans.
But the reaction yesterday to Mr. Bush's latest remarks was muted.
"From time to time, the ideas and positions of the Republican front-runner may differ from the positions taken by House Republicans," said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, who accused Mr. Bush last week of not understanding much about the way Congress operates.
"This should not be interpreted as a conflict or infighting," Mr. DeLay said yesterday.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois said, "I'm not sure we've been on the road to Gomorrah." But then he said Congressional Republicans agreed with much of the philosophy behind Mr. Bush's proposals on education.
Democrats questioned whether Mr. Bush's ruminations on what he sees as the shortcomings of the Republican Party were a sort of camouflage, meant to distract people from the content of his education proposals, which they said were not much different from the suggestions made by many other Republicans.
Sandra Feldman, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said after Mr. Bush's speech yesterday: "The rhetoric sure is different. But when you boil it down, it's not new ideas."
Ms. Feldman said she was particularly troubled by Mr. Bush's professed penchant for using public money for private ventures, in the form of charter schools, which she said would be more difficult for the Government to monitor.
Last month, when Mr. Bush made his first education speech as a candidate for national office, he advocated taking some Federal aid away from failing schools in poor areas and giving it to parents so that they could use it for private tuition or tutors. It was essentially a voucher plan, although he did not word it that way.
The Governor's speech yesterday expanded on his promotion of alternatives to public schools where student test scores show no improvement. He said that the Federal Government should require all students in the third to eighth grades to be tested yearly in reading and math, and that Fedral aid to schools should reflect the results.
"We will praise and reward success -- and I promise you, I will shine a spotlight of shame on failure."

HEADLINE: Campus Housing in Short Supply

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
The Howard Johnson Hotel in Boston's Kenmore Square has all the trappings of a AAA-approved lodging: piped in elevator music, key-card doors, burgundy carpeting.
But inside her fifth-floor room, a guest, Joanna Janczurewicz, has thrown off the lavender bedspread in favor of the black-and-white comforter and cowhide-print pillow she brought from home. She has rewallpapered much of the room with band posters, magazine clippings and pictures of friends. Dead red roses hang from the framed generic hotel prints, which she has mercifully covered over. Ms. Janczurewicz, with her ebony-lined eyes and dyed multicolor hair, does not quite match the HoJo's decor either. But, hey, this is her dormitory now. 
 Ms. Janczurewicz is one of 380 Boston University students who began the fall semester living at hotels in Boston and in Cambridge, symptoms of a shortage of dormitory space that is affecting colleges not only in Boston but nationwide. With increased enrollments from the children of the baby boomers, and a tight housing market brought on by a strong economy, more students want to live on campus, but there is not room for all of them, university officials said.
For the second year in a row, the University of Maryland's College Park campus has 126 students bunking in a local hotel. Dillard University in New Orleans had to put 45 students into the nearby Ramada Inn; nine other students are enjoying Southern hospitality down the street at the Gentilly Bed and Breakfast.
But Boston, which is home to about 67,000 students each year, faces the biggest crunch. With a 2 percent vacancy rate in the city, upperclassmen are skipping the hassle of finding their own apartments and asking to stay on campus. The trend has pushed the University of Massachusetts at Amherst into paying for rooms for about 100 students during the first week of classes at an on-campus hotel, and Northeastern University into putting up 80 students at the Y.M.C.A. and hundreds of others at leased apartments off-campus.
The University of Massachusetts had its hotel dwellers into real dormitories by the first weekend of the semester, although 150 others were still living in residence hall lounges that had been converted to makeshift bedrooms.
"They tend to be doubles, three or four times larger than a regular room -- corner rooms with a balcony and wonderful view," said a university spokeswoman, Barbara Pitoniak. Although about 250 students have been moved from those spaces, Ms. Pitoniak said, "the people that are in there now are very happy to stay there through the semester."
They also get a rebate of about $150 per semester on the average double room rate of $1,319.
Boston University found campus rooms for 124 of its hotel guests in the first two weeks of classes, but Ms. Janczurewicz and her roommate, both freshmen, will have a hotel address through the fall, and are quite content to keep their full-size beds. The digs are much nicer than the rooms in Warren Towers, the enormous dormitory Ms. Janczurewicz toured last year. "They are like prison rooms," she said.
The overhead heating lamp in their bathroom gives off a nightclublike red glow. Because there is no campus security checking identification cards, "We're the party room," Ms. Janczurewicz said. "We have people here all the time."
Colleges make educated guesses about how many of the students they accept will actually attend, but that gets trickier as enrollments rise. And some colleges play the odds like overbooked airlines, knowing that attrition will free up residence hall rooms during the semester.
"For the university, it is better financially to carry the cost of hotel space than it is to carry the cost of empty dormitory space," said a Boston University spokesman, Kevin Carleton.
The university, which has housed students at the Howard Johnson since the 1980's, bought the hotel in 1992 with the intention of developing the land, but left management to Howard Johnson. Campus housing is so tight that the university, which once used the hotel only for emergency housing, now keeps 125 rooms for students to live in the entire semester.
The university pays for two and a half floors of the seven-floor hotel -- prices range from $145 to $210 per night -- while the public uses the other four and half floors. The students pay $5,020 for the school year, the same amount they would pay for a double room on-campus.
Colleges try to give the hotels a dormitory flavor. Across from the ice machine on each floor of the Howard Johnson, a bulletin board lists the university's on-call resident assistant. The University of Maryland named the part of the hotel it leases Terrapin Tower after the university mascot.
Dillard University learned not to house freshmen in hotels. "This is a transition period in their lives and we would rather they made this transition under the watchful eye of in loco parentis," said Michael Lomax, the president of Dillard.
Northeastern has been housing students at the campus Y.M.C.A. for years. The space is reserved for transfer and older students who have outgrown late-night partying in the halls.
Eric Blomstrom, 28, said he was thankful for his placement at the Y after hearing about the housing scarcity at other campuses.
"I was like, great," he said. "It's perfect. It's a single. I know it's very difficult to get a single at any school." Besides, with message boards on the doors and 38 men on the floor sharing two showers, "it does feel a little like a dorm," he said. Students have their own elevator and security desk, but no free access to the health club.
Mr. Blomstrom's room, with its view of a concrete courtyard, is a far cry from Northeastern's newest residence hall, West Village. The stylish building is the first phase of a $100 million housing project that will add 1,680 beds when it is completed in 2001. A flashy high-rise, West Village is the university's first housing addition in years in a city where institutional expansion has always been a sore issue with neighborhood residents.
Backed by the mayor's endorsement and better relations with the town, Boston University will open an $84 million residence hall, its first since the 1960's, and Harvard is planning a $40 million housing project for 554 graduate students. When it is completed in 2002, the project will be Harvard's first housing construction in over a decade.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology will require all freshmen to live on campus starting in 2001, the same year it will complete a new undergraduate residence hall with 350 beds. But with 386 freshmen living in independent space -- mostly fraternities and sororities -- and 140 others assigned to "crowded rooms," an M.I.T. spokesman, Bob Sales, said, "If the numbers stay the same, it won't take care of the overflow."
Ms. Janczurewicz said she would like to get to know the students on her hotel floor, but hanging out in the halls is forbidden, and only a pizza box outside one door is a sign of the thriving college life inside. For now, though, her room has a real dormitory feel, right down to the hole in the bathroom ceiling and the crack in the mirror.
And that daily maid service that makes her classmates so jealous? "Now it's only two or three times a week," she said.

HEADLINE: Auto Workers In Canada Avert Strike

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 5

 BODY:
With less than two hours to spare before a threatened strike, the DaimlerChrysler Corporation reached an agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers union on a new three-year contract covering the company's 13,800 workers in Canada.
Under the agreement, DaimlerChrysler's factory workers will get annual raises of 3 percent on top of their cost-of-living adjustments; a $1,200 (Canadian), or $818 (United States), annual holiday bonus; a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus; an $800 (Canadian) tuition reimbursement for workers' children, and a $2,000 (Canadian) child care benefit. 
 The Canadian union president Basil E. Hargrove announced the deal at 10:25 P.M. and called it "an excellent package." The union had threatened to strike at midnight.
The Canadian union will begin labor talks later this month with the General Motors Corporation. The union had already reached a deal with the Ford Motor Company on a new labor contract.
Meanwhile, the United Automobile Workers union today gave Ford Motor a Friday deadline to reach an agreement with the union on a new labor contract or watch its 101,033 factory workers in the United States walk out on strike.
The union strike threat gives Ford until 3:30 Friday afternoon to find common ground with the union. The company expressed hope that a strike could be avoided. "We're optimistic," said Edward K. Miller, Ford's manager of corporate news. "This is a normal part of the collective bargaining process and there is no reason to believe we can't reach an agreement by Friday."
The U.A.W. union did not return calls seeking comment. Talks between the union and Ford recessed this afternoon, and are expected to resume Wednesday morning.
Labor contracts between the nation's 400,000 unionized auto workers and Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler were set to expire Sept. 14, but were extended indefinitely as the union continued negotiations on new contracts with the companies. DaimlerChrysler and G.M. have already reached agreements with the union without strikes -- or even the threat of strikes.
But the union today gave Ford the required 72-hour notice that it would end the current contract Friday afternoon.
DaimlerChrysler workers already ratified their four-year contract, and G.M. workers are scheduled to vote next week on a similar contract. It is expected to win near-unanimous approval. Both contracts call for a $1,350 signing bonus and annual raises of 3 percent above inflation.
Ford workers are expected to get the same generous raises, but workers have been upset by Ford's plans to spin off its Visteon auto parts subsidiary. The 23,500 union members working at Visteon have been nervous that their jobs would not be as secure as those at Ford.

HEADLINE: 14-Hour Days? They Have Other Ideas

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
Like any recent law school graduate, Joseph was eager to make a good impression on his new employers. "I showed up at 9 A.M. my first day here and left at 2 A.M.," he said of his job at a large Boston firm.
But after months of 14-hour days, he began to think that the six-figure salary was not worth it. "I lost all my friends," he said. He had plenty of money, but no time to pay his bills. Joseph, 28, asked that his last name not be used for this article because now, in his fourth year with the firm, he plans to leave his job, and the legal profession, in the spring. 
 Young lawyers, the grunt workers of the trade, are abandoning their employers in droves, either moving to other firms or jobs or leaving the profession altogether. At large firms, 44 percent of new associates leave within three years and 73 percent within six, according to a 1998 study by the National Association for Law Placement. Paula Patton, the group's executive director, said the study was the first to track departures. But, she said, firms around the country almost unanimously tell the same tale: The problem has become much worse over the last few years.
"So many had cut back on their hiring during the recession" in 1990 and 1991, she said. "They started filling their ranks by recruiting associates from other firms. That's how the cycle got started."
Stephen Dannhauser, the executive partner of Weil, Gotshal & Manges L.L.P. in New York, said his 700-member firm -- like its competitors -- has been losing employees at a high rate since then. He blames the thriving economy, which has created demand for lawyers in places where it hardly existed before.
"The opportunities are not just to move to another law firm, but to go to an investment bank, to go to an equity firm, to go in-house with a major organization," he said. The situation became so severe a year ago that Weil, Gotshal formed a committee to figure out how to keep younger lawyers happy.
Powering the trend is the profession's hunger for billable hours. To offset starting salaries that now average $85,000 nationwide, big firms often push the new hires to work upward of 2,000 billable hours a year. Add the time consumed by meetings and administrative tasks, and many put in 70 hours a week or more.
"Lawyers are getting burned out," said R. Robert Popeo, chairman of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo P.C., a 300-member firm in Boston.
Lauren Stiller Rikleen, former president of the Boston Bar Association, says law firms have become much more competitive in the last 20 years, raising workloads and stress levels alike. A study this year by the association found that a major reason for departures is the desire of younger lawyers to spend more time with their families. Yet they hestitate to buck the workaholoic cultures of their workplaces. Instead, the study said, "They vote with their feet."
Not just lawyers have itchy feet, of course. Accountants, who also work around the billable hour, and high-technology professionals are hard to recruit, much less retain. And the tight job market is encouraging a lot of jumping around in general.
But law firms say they feel particularly beleaguered. The odds of making partner have dwindled over the years, increasing the incentive to chase after bigger salaries elsewhere. Indeed, one-fourth of young associates polled in August by The New York Law Journal said they expected to change jobs in the next 18 months, and 40 percent said they would eventually switch careers.
But not all are living for money. Consider Juliana Rice, who graduated from law school in 1993 and joined a 13-lawyer firm. When she became pregnant a few months later, a partner told her, "This couldn't have happened at a worse time." And when she returned from maternity leave, the partners made cutting comments about her habit of leaving at 5:30 P.M. to see her daughter before bedtime, even though she had been in the office for 10 hours.
After three and a half years, she took a job, with a pay cut but fewer hours, in the Massachusetts Attorney General's office. Now, she said, "Nobody looks at me funny when I leave at 5 P.M. to pick up my daughter."
To stem the flow of talent, some firms are offering three-month assignments in Europe, sabbaticals or tuition for continuing education. Barry Wolf, a member of the new retention committee at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said his firm planned new policies to make young associates happier. "Now we're going to make retention equal with recruiting," he said.
Other firms are offering "longevity bonuses" to associates who stick around. Shearman & Sterling in New York, for example, which lost 24 percent of its associates in 1997, recently announced $45,000 bonuses to associates who stay on for three years. It said it expected the departure rate to be cut almost in half this year. Even so, Ms. Patton of the National Association for Law Placement said, money "is not ultimately the thing that will keep them if they are otherwise disconsolate about their workplace."
To be sure, plenty of people are willing to slave away, just as their forebears did. John B. Towers, who graduated from the New York University Law School this year, listened to the anxieties of many of his classmates and heard horror stories of "sweatshop" firms. He is now in his fourth week with Ropes & Gray in Boston, and he said he went into the deal with his eyes open. "I'm not under the illusion that anybody is going to pay me $90,000 a year to work a 9-to-5 job my first year out of school," he said. "I will work as much as I'm required to. Whether or not I can sustain that for a period of 4 to 40 years, only time will tell."

HEADLINE: TRENDS;
For Manufacturing Jobs, Boom Towns Past and Future

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR. 

 BODY:
Smaller cities in the South and West have enjoyed the fastest growth in factory jobs since the late 1980's, led by Boise, Idaho, where Micron Technology employs 9,000, a research report shows. Boise is expected to stay hot as its high-technology boom fuels traditional industries.
 In Las Vegas, Nev., a population explosion has created endless jobs in industries from bakeries to contractors that cater to all those new households. 
 Factories are humming in Austin, Tex., now a serious industrial town, according to Nestor Terleckyj, president of NPA Data Services, the research company. He noted that state capitals like Boise and Austin, along with university towns like Bloomington, Ill., and Colorado Springs, have become fertile grounds for manufacturing.
 A projected job surge in Punta Gorda, Fla., a retirement community, is a statistical quirk stemming from the creation of a free-trade zone at the local airport, town officials say. In Naples, Fla., light manufacturing is growing because of expansion at Shaw Aero, a producer of aviation components, and a new Tyton Hellermann plastics plant. In addition, Robbin Koch, an economic development spokeswoman, says a lot of corporate chief executives have bought second homes in Naples, and now they're thinking how to get their business moved here.

HEADLINE: Obuchi Picks Aide Linked To Buddhists For Cabinet

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi shuffled his Cabinet today, adding a member of a Buddhist-backed political party to give his Government the support of the largest coalition in Japan in more than 40 years.
Japanese political analysts say the addition of the New Komeito Party to the coalition will permit Mr. Obuchi to push through rapidly a series of major bills on Japan's economy and its role in the world. 
 The most dramatic would let Japan participate in international peacekeeping operations and defend itself more strongly against military attack. Since its defeat in World War II, a Constitution written by the United States prohibited most military activities.
But in recent years Japan's refusal to participate in international peacekeeping efforts has drawn criticism from the United States and other allies, especially in regional crises like the recent turmoil in East Timor.
The other expected initiatives include badly needed changes in the financing of nursing care for the elderly and social welfare.
New Komeito is the political arm of one of the largest and most controversial religious groups, the lay Buddhist organization known as Soka Gakkai.
The expansion of the coalition to include the group occurred only after weeks of negotiations that threatened to rupture the Liberal Democratic Party's existing coalition.
Although Soka Gakkai maintains that it is independent, many Japanese suspect that it is dominated by Soka Gakkagi, its Buddhist parent organization and its shadowy honorary chairman, Daisuki Ikeda.
Mr. Obuchi has been riding a wave of unexpectedly good news like an apparent upturn in the long-depressed economy and the steady but not unrelated strength in his approval ratings.
This morning, most newspaper readers rose to find him smiling triumphantly in photographs with his new coalition partners.
Although, the Cabinet reshuffle brought about a near wholesale turnover of the Government, Mr. Obuchi retained his top economic advisers, including the Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa.
But Mr. Obuchi replaced the chief of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, Hakuo Yanagisawa, who was widely respected among Western banking analysts for his handling of problems in the financial system. He was succeeded by Michio Ochi, a former Economic Planning Minister. Page C4.
Among the new appointments are Yohei Kono as Foreign Minister. Mr. Kono is a former Deputy Prime Minister who was also Foreign Minister in a previous Government.
Notwithstanding Mr. Obuchi's newly strengthened parliamentary position, many political analysts here say there are still threatening clouds on the horizon.
The most immediate involves perceptions that the Government mishandled the accident last week at a nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant.
Japanese press reports focused abundantly on the bureaucratic bungling of the emergency response that kept Mr. Obuchi from learning of the accident on Thursday until two hours after it had occurred. For much of that time, Mr. Obuchi was out to lunch.
Most accounts made it appear that the Prime Minister and his top aides continued to be more preoccupied with negotiations over the new Cabinet than with the nuclear disaster.
"This was a disaster that may have major consequences on their future nuclear policy, but one wonders just how seriously this is being taken," said John Neuffer, a political analyst with Mitsui Marine Research Institute.
Mr. Obuchi's longer-range threat in terms of public opinion arrives, though, from the strong opposition in many quarters to the entry of what many Japanese consider a religious party into politics. Although his own poll numbers are at their highest level ever, recent surveys indicate that up to 51 percent of voters oppose the Buddhist-related party's entry into the coalition.
The expansion of the coalition to include Komeito nearly backfired on Mr. Obuchi, who faced strong opposition within his own party and from his other coalition partner, the smaller more conservative Liberal Party.
"If Komeito were outside of the Government, the price of gaining their cooperation would be higher, and that is why Obuchi has invited them in," said Seizaburo Sato, deputy director of the National Graduate Institute of Policy Studies. "But Komeito is regarded suspiciously, because it is not organized like other parties. It is dominated by one individual."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 11, 1999, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the appointment of a Japanese Cabinet member who belongs to a party backed by a Buddhist organization misspelled the given name of the honorary president of the organization. He is Daisaku Ikeda, not Daisuki. The article also misspelled the name of the organization at one point. It is Soka Gakkai, not Gakkagi.

HEADLINE: Charity Concerts to Go on Internet

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
WHEN the curtain rises Saturday afternoon on Netaid, a series of international benefit concerts to raise money for world anti-poverty programs, pop idols like David Bowie, Sting and Sean "Puffy" Combs are scheduled to perform. But the real star of the show is more likely to be the Internet.
For years, audiences at events like "We Are The World" and "Farm Aid" have gathered and listened to wealthy entertainers sing, play and plead for the more fortunate to help out the less so. But after the last note dissolves into history, the public's commitment to the cause of the day usually evaporates quickly. 
 Netaid's principal creators and organizers, the United Nations Development Program and Cisco Systems, are planning to make the 10-hour event the exception. To do that, they say, they will take advantage of the Internet's ability to be informative, immediate and intimate.
"We want to use the computer to help change how the world looks at poverty and motivate people to help," said Djibril Diallo, public affairs director for the United Nations agency, which began examining ways of combining music, high technology and altruism more than a year ago.
As the Internet broadens its reach, Amnesty International, Habitat for Humanity and other humanitarian and philanthropic groups have been turning to what may be the planet's biggest soapbox, hoping to raise money materials and find volunteers.
In the case of the United Nations agency, which has the stated mission of eradicating extreme poverty, the Web site (www.Netaid.org) is a clearing house of information on the state of world poverty and the agency's programs as well as a means of raising money.
"The difference between this and earlier concerts is that we created a vehicle for people to come back, not just on the night of the concert with the one check they write," said Mark Malloch Brown, the new administrator of the the development program. "But instead, here's a site they're going to come back to time after time."
Using techniques and technologies more commonly found on sites devoted to electronic commerce, the site, which was opened last month with President Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former President, logging on, is expected to make global philanthropy more efficient, its designers say.
Netaid's organizers say they are hoping to draw millions of people to the site by using it for a Webcast of the concerts being held Saturday at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Wembley Stadium in London and Palais des Nations in Geneva. While the concerts will also be broadcast over a global network of conventional radio and television stations, the Webcast is scheduled to offer exclusive interviews and peeks backstage.
To accomplish the task, the site, created through a partnership led by Cisco Systems with Akamai Technologies and KPMG, is expected to use more than 125,000 simultaneous live streams to reach an anticipated on-line audience of more than 10 million people, said Douglas Graham, a partner with KPMG, a New York-based professional services firm that designed the site.
The largest previous Webcast was a lingerie fashion show last winter done by Victoria's Secret using 12,000 live streams. That number proved inadequate, leaving throngs of potential viewers unable to view the show. By contrast, Mr. Graham said, the Netaid site has the capacity to handle enormous amounts of Internet traffic, including 60 million hits an hour, and process 1,000 donations a second. The site, which is built on a network created by 1,500 servers in more than 90 data centers around the world, is prepared to handle a billion hits, Mr. Graham said.
Over time, Mr. Malloch Brown said, the Netaid site could be used to help give contributors a clearer accounting of how donations are used. "We're looking at developing reporting systems where they'll be able to log on and check how their money is being used by a set of projects," he said.
Larry Lang, vice president of service-provider marketing for Cisco Systems, which through its corporation and foundation has donated $20 million to Netaid, said the site might soon have a high-tech, active matching system born in the financial markets.
The system will permit groups and people with particular needs to register them in a Netaid database. It will also allow people who are willing to donate particular skills or materials to register them in the database. Technology that is used to match buyers and sellers in the financial world could then match those in need with those willing to fill those needs by introducing one to the other by way of automatic E-mail messages.
"One thing that is good about this effort," Mr. Lang said, referring to the Netaid project, "is that it reminds people that the Internet is a powerful tool to amplify human capabilities and to demonstrate the better sides of our nature."

HEADLINE: In Cuba, Seeds of a Design Renaissance

BYLINE: By FRANCES ANDERTON 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
IF one thinks of architecture in Cuba today, it is of splendid but decaying Colonial buildings floating like the ghosts of grand dowagers through the movie "Buena Vista Social Club." Or the freshly primped, restored buildings in Old Havana. Visitors will also find the capital bursting with 20th-century buildings in a spirited Cuban fusion of international and tropical styles: Art Deco movie theaters, streamline Moderne apartments, sassy 1950's hotels in Morris Lapidus Modern and, crowning them all, the Expressionist art schools of the 60's, once as ripe as mangoes in their sensuality and revolutionary spirit.
But where is the attention-seeking new architecture, the kind that has graced the global architectural stage in the last 20 years? It is mostly nonexistent. 
 The last three decades have seen Cuba's amazing architectural heritage yield to the utilitarian and architects recede into the shadows. As Julio Cesar Perez, a professor of design at Jose Antonio Echeverria City University in Havana, put it, "There is no Michael Graves here, no Frank Gehry, no Philip Johnson." There is no machinery promoting new architects and new buildings. Architects work for state firms, largely on mundane tourist structures. The few who work on individual commissions often do not attach their names publicly to the projects so as not to call attention to themselves.
With state salaries of roughly $15 a month, Cuba's architects have had little wherewithal to dream. Though at the top of the pay scale, they can barely afford to make blueprints or take taxis to the building site, let alone buy foreign architecture magazines. And they must deal with shortages of materials and poor craftsmanship.
But in recent months, a generation of Cuban architects pressing for change say they are scenting the whiff of a renaissance. A modish new restaurant, A Prado y Neptuno, designed by Roberto Gottardi, opened early this year in Old Havana. A striking new hotel, the Packard, fusing a masonry base with a sleek steel roof and a huge exterior ceramic mural, is to be built nearby, by two talented young architects, Oscar Garcia, 36, and Teresa Martin, 32. A remodeling of a bank on swank Fifth Avenue will offer a lively cocktail of tapering roof, curving elevations and sloping canopies that echo the Los Angeles school of sculptural design. And a once-influential magazine, Arquitectura Cuba, has restarted. "There was a void between the late 60's and Mr. Gottardi's new restaurant, but now, there is something in the air in the architectural mood," said Emilio Castro, an architect and graphic artist whose wall designs adorn A Prado y Neptuno.
In general, the state has taken the view that "we don't want to insert new buildings into Old Havana until architects develop the right sensibility," said Gina Rey, director of the Group for the Integral Development of Havana, an urban planning authority. Its philosophy was "save first, then bring in the new," Ms. Rey added. But with the approval of the Hotel Packard this week, and a thumbs up for A Prado y Neptuno in the state newspaper, Granma, contemporary architecture seems to be getting a Government endorsement.
In a series of conversations with Emilio Castro and several other Cuban architects, they explained how over the last 30 years they saw the role of the architect change from artist-builder to technician. "It was not about style; it was about the whole structure of architectural practice," said Eduardo Luis Rodriguez, editor of Arquitectura Cuba and author of "Havana Guide: Modern Architecture, 1925-1965" (to be published by Princeton Architectural Press in February).
After Fidel Castro took power in 1959, about two-thirds of Cuba's architects left the island, said Raul Gonzalez Romero, a professor at City University and a practicing architect since the 1950's. Those who chose to remain had to quit private practice to work for the state. In its exuberant early years, the state commissioned poetic civic structures like the five art schools, which though decayed are open to the public today, and an ambitious social building program. Even now, Mr. Gonzalez's face lights up as he describes how in 1961, architecture students were sent into the field to work with farmers on designing and building an agricultural cooperative.
But by the late 1960's, a few years after the abrupt termination of the arts schools (originally commissioned by Fidel Castro and designed by Ricardo Porro, Vittorio Garatti and Mr. Gottardi), the Government ceased to commission artistic civic architecture.
Twenty years of mass construction of much needed -- though badly built -- pre-fabricated social housing, schools and libraries followed. Architecture education during this era focused on practical, problem-solving projects and very little on the art of design. "We had 40 hours of instruction in space, form and color in five years," Ms. Martin, a recent architecture graduate, said.
After the opening of Cuba to foreign investment at the end of the cold war, a decade of bland international hotels and convention and shopping centers followed. They now employ 90 percent of Cuba's architects, Ms. Martin estimated, but the assignments offer little chance for a personal style.
Many architects still become frustrated and leave. Ana Karakadze, 25, a Cuban interior designer who worked on hotels in the tourist sea resort of Varadero before bolting for Miami six months ago, said she found that "when you you try to be individual" the state firms that deal with the investors "start saying no."
"You've got to do what the foreign people want you to do," Ms. Karakadze added. "You start feeling like you are a foreigner in your own country." Ms. Karakadze, who now works in Coral Gables, Fla., says she believes many Cuban architects who have left feel as she does, "that in Cuba you don't have perspective or hope because you always have to do what the Government says." She added, "Even to buy doors the Government has to decide."
BUT others who have stayed are feeling the winds of change. They point to A Prado y Neptuno on the ground floor of a late 19th-century building on the patrician Paseo del Prado. It was designed by Mr. Gottardi, 73, a gentle Italian who fell in love with the Socialist ideology of Cuba nearly 40 years ago. He is probably best known for his design of the School of Dramatic Arts, an intriguing "city" of spare, Louis Kahn-like structures in a network of slender alleyways reminiscent of his native Venice.
A Prado y Neptuno was the brainchild of Eusebio Leal, famed city historian and director of the restoration of Old Havana. It is owned by Habaguanex, the Cuban enterprise that is financing the restoration of Old Havana -- including a pending remodeling of a 1906 Catalonian Art Nouveau building by Emilio Castro -- with the profits from its restaurants and hotels. An Italian co-investor, Arsia International, commissioned Mr. Gottardi.
Though modest compared with the groundbreaking art schools, A Prado y Neptuno offers a modern interior in a historic district. Dining areas are decked out in a lively eclecticism that Mr. Gottardi says is part of the Cuban tradition. There are Macintosh-inspired chairs in the dining room, Roy Lichtenstein look-alike panels by Emilio Castro in the bathroom.
A mural of Mr. Gottardi's favorite designers cheekily places Philippe Starck, Frank Lloyd Wright, Carlo Scarpa, Charles Rennie Macintosh and Louis Kahn center stage (it includes his own likeness as a young man). On the exterior, there is yellow tiling like the concrete blocks in Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House.
Down the road at the corner of Paseo del Prado and Carcel is the site of the Packard Hotel, by Mr. Garcia and Ms. Martin for the state firm Maceo. The two, who earn $15 a month each no matter how large the project, still believe themselves to be among the lucky beneficiaries of a slowly changing system. Mr. Garcia said, "Money is welcome, but more important is to try to make contemporary architecture."
Where the Packard Hotel is the project of a state firm, Mr. Garcia's and Ms. Martin's other project, the Banco Financiero Internacional, came to them personally from the National Union of Artists and Writers of Cuba, a state association that includes selected architects. (Mr. Garcia and Ms. Martin were invited to be members this week.) The union can hand out plum assignments to favorite architects.
Cuban and foreign businesses sometimes enter into arrangements with cultural institutions, like the union, if they are seeking a more imaginative and efficient way of building than "the complex processes of the big offices of the State," as one architect said who has worked in this way. These institutions will in turn enlist an artist or architect who may get paid an unregulated fee but does not always attach his or her name publicly to the project.
These arrangements result in the odd situation where architects of some of the most adventurous new designs, like an unbuilt futuristic amusement park, are keeping quiet about their involvement, even concealing the location of the project. The designers of a shopping center under construction prefer not to declare their participation.
Yet, this system of cultural sponsorship, even if architects often remain anonymous, is countering 30 years of big, bad building by theConstruction Ministry and, Mr. Garcia says, letting a few architects contribute to "the cultural patrimony."
Not only are there few outlets for publicity, but sometimes it can get architects into trouble. One architect took a reporter to see his new building in a town away from Havana that he asked not to be identified. Suffused in the peach halo of a rainy sunset was the skeleton, the size of a large bungalow.
There was no sign saying what the structure was, or who was building there.
The architect was careful to conceal the building's real purpose -- a church, built with private financing. Rather than go through the lengthy process of trying to get a rare Government permit, he called it a residence and configured it like a house, hoping for a "change of use" permit down the line.
The architect has neither signed the drawings nor keep them in his possession. And no, thank you, the project certainly cannot be published in the United States.
Eric Owen Moss is an American architect much admired by Mr. Garcia and Ms. Martin. He visited Havana in 1996 with a group of international architects. "I think you can see something sweeping out of Cuba," he said from Los Angeles. "The noose is loosening and a sensibility that hasn't expressed itself yet will emerge. I think it's going to be some other kind of language, with a lot of power and blood in it. And I think it's moving to somewhere where they may be able to sign their names."
Professor Perez of the City University says the reason for this re-emergence of a more confident architectural voice is the 1980's generation of graduates, who are more questioning than their cold war forbears.
"We've reacted against badly built and designed buildings and bad planning," said Mr. Perez, a dapper, relentlessly peppy 40-something who speaks a snappy English.
Mr. Perez, who seems not to flail in the enervating rainy season heat, is rare in that he has his own office and designs private houses. "Designing private residences is kind of rare in Cuba," he said, "because they typify the architecture of capitalism."
But in his hometown, San Antonio de los Banos, outside Havana, Mr. Perez has built a string of houses for friends that are variations on the traditional Cuban courtyard homes, in poured concrete and concrete block rather than of stone or brick.
Mr. Perez is also part of a group calling for the preservation of Havana beyond the boundaries of the Old Havana district, especially of the arts schools, presently disintegrating in a sea of tropical vegetation. The most optimistic architects still want to pursue careers in their country.
Mr. Gottardi lives in a crumbling concrete slab building from the early 1970's. His small apartment is lined with architecture books, pictures of his wife, who is a dancer, and Che Guevara. He said that while the lack of maintenance of his buildings is frustrating, creatively, he is satisfied in Cuba. "There are many things that are not about consumerism," he said, adding, "I need other things that I find here."
ON a warm September evening, Mr. Gottardi was having drinks at Prado y Neptuno with Mr. Garcia and Ms. Martin, his former students, in front of a green and purple neon installation that celebrates the enganadora, a famous cha-cha that begins with the line "A Prado y Neptuno." They must raise their voices to compete with that of Fidel Castro, delivering a speech on the loud overhead television.
The restaurant, a part of the dollar economy of Havana, is at an intersection of the city that sees grand, patched-together, pre-revolution Chevrolets and post-revolution Ladas parade by in the daytime. Tonight, in their place, are shiny European, Korean and Japanese compact cars, the property of Cuban officials, or those who have been granted permission to buy them.
For locals, this intersection represents modernity and investment. For architects like Mr. Gottardi, Mr. Garcia and Ms. Martin, it is a place where their power, perhaps even their blood, is seeping back into architecture.
"We are trying to find a space in the culture," Mr. Garcia said.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Jumped 1.3% In August, Outpacing Estimate

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Orders to United States factories vaulted ahead in August on the strength of higher demand for airplanes and electronics in another sign of a resurgence in manufacturing.
The 1.3 percent gain in factory orders was the 12th increase in the last 15 months, the Commerce Department said today. Analysts had generally expected factory orders to rise six-tenths of a percent. Even that would have been brisk. 
 "This is a pace that insures significant production increases for the rest of the year and into 2000," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers.
The report, along with other recent manufacturing data, shows "that manufacturing is really healing from the global downturn from the past year or so," said Cliff Waldman, an economist at Waldman Associates in Arlington, Va.
With overseas economies in recovery, demand for the nation's manufactured goods should continue to pick up through the end of the year, economists said.
"Almost every indicator for the factory sector is firming, which suggests accelerating factory activity in the months ahead," said Merrill Lynch's senior economist, Stan Shipley.
A jump in orders for airplane and aircraft parts contributed to a 4.8 percent increase in orders for all transportation products in August, the fourth consecutive monthly gain. That was up from a 2.1 percent gain in July.
Even excluding the volatile transportation category, factory orders would have risen a solid eight-tenths of a percent in August.
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, a category that includes household appliances, grew by eight-tenths of a percent in August, down from an 8 percent increase the month before.
The increase in overall factory orders occurred despite a 2.1 decrease in orders for industrial machinery and equipment, the sector that includes computers. That followed a hefty 10.5 percent gain in July.
Orders for primary metals like steel lost a little ground in August, falling 1 percent after rising 3.4 percent the month before.
Orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last three years or more -- rose 1.2 percent in August, following a 4.3 percent gain in July.
Orders for nondurable goods like fuel rose 1.5 percent, with orders for petroleum, coal products, chemicals and paper registering the biggest increases. In July, orders for nondurable-goods went up two-tenths of a percent.

Fading dividends don't always mean the dawn of a recession.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
IF the measure of corporate America's financial health is its ability and willingness to increase dividends to shareholders, then you might think the country is in a recession.
The Standard & Poor's Corporation reports that 117 companies announced dividend increases in September, 10 fewer than had raised their payouts a year earlier. It was the 15th consecutive month that the number of dividend increases was down year-over-year. 
 By itself, such a long string of relative bad news is not extraordinary, even though you might expect that more and more companies would raise dividends every year simply because the number of stocks traded rises every year.
What is unusual is that the economy is doing so well even while companies are growing more reluctant to raise their dividends. This is the seventh such streak of at least 15 months since S.& P. began counting dividend increases back in 1955. In all but one of the six previous runs, there was a recession in the period. Recessions, of course, usually mean sharp falloffs in corporate profits. So a dearth of dividend increases in such periods should be expected.
The exception -- the time when companies cut back on dividend increases even as the economy continued to grow -- is the most interesting case, with perhaps the most relevance to the current situation. From August 1966 through March 1968, there was a string of 21 months in which the number of dividend increases kept falling.
That came during the longest expansion in American history, which began in 1961 and ended in 1969. The current expansion is the second longest, and will take over the top spot if, as seems likely, no recession starts by February.
Moreover, the late-1960's market, memorably called "the go-go years" by the business writer John Brooks, bears more than a passing resemblance to this one. The stock market had been going up steadily for the better part of two decades, amid increasing public participation and interest. Mutual fund managers became media stars as their funds soared through the purchase of small technology stocks that zoomed in price. There was a huge wave of mergers, many financed by issuing highly valued stock.
In 1968, however, the good days were nearing an end. It was not just that a recession hit at the end of 1969. It was that the stock market was also entering a long period of poor returns that would lead to widespread public rejection of stocks as an investment vehicle. While the major indexes would move to marginal new highs the next few years, the big gains were over. Fourteen years after 1968, in 1982, stock prices were still below the 1968 highs.
There are differences, of course. An important one now is the spread of stock options as a major form of compensation for corporate executives. Option holders benefit from price rises in the stocks of their companies, but not from dividends that are paid while they hold the options. That provides an incentive for companies to hold down dividends and, instead, distribute money to shareholders by repurchasing stock. Such stock repurchases are popular and many companies have borrowed money to buy back stock.
Another difference is that dividends are now far lower than they were in 1968, at least as a percentage of the price of stocks. In 1968, the dividend yield on the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks when the index peaked was 2.8 percent. That was, in fact, a very low figure by historical standards. But now the yield is about 1.3 percent, well below half that level.
Dividends can go so low because investors do not care much about them. It is capital gains that have made them rich, and it is the pursuit of capital gains that drives stock investments now. "Companies love this flexibility, not being tied into a fixed dividend that may be a struggle to pay," said Arnold Kaufman, the editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook, a newsletter that tracks dividends.
Of course, companies have always loved such flexibility. What is different is that investors have gradually come to believe that payouts are unimportant, and so have not fought very hard for higher payouts. "It is working quite well for everyone involved, except for those poor people who have come to depend on dividends for living expenses," commented Mr. Kaufman.
After 1968, as it became clear that capital losses were also possible, investors came to value dividends, and the pressure grew on companies to pay them. By the time the stock market hit bottom in 1974, the dividend yield on the S.& P. 500 was up to 5.8 percent. Part of the reason was that dividends had risen since 1968, but most of the change reflected a fall in stock prices.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury PricesHold Steady Ahead of September Job Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday as investors failed to follow through on early buying. Market participants wound up instead focusing on the employment report coming tomorrow.
The oversold condition of the market could have been a factor behind yesterday's early bounce in prices as some investors sought attractive yields, which are hovering near two-month highs. 
 Analysts said the decision by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged helped ease some inflation fears. Still, the central bank's indication that it is leaning toward an increase in the future is keeping economic data squarely in the spotlight.
Jack Ablin, president of Colonial Asset Management Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., said investor sentiment traditionally played a large role in trading, "and it's that sentiment that has pushed the limit on the low side of prices over the past few days, a definite negative for bonds.
"However, near term," he said, "it has become a positive because investors probably have oversold, and that leaves some buying opportunities."
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 2/32, to 99 13/32. Its yield was unchanged at 6.17 percent. A two-year note, on the other hand, slipped 2/32, to 99 22/32. Its yield rose to 5.79 percent from 5.76 percent on Tuesday.
"Right now, the underlying concern is with wages and labor and consumer spending," Mr. Ablin said. "People are spending at a faster clip than they are earning, which is a concern for the Fed. I don't see much happening between now and Friday, when the September employment report is released." He said a big number would hurt bonds and he was not so sure a low number would change the negative psychology of the bond market.
Analysts expect a gain of 225,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, up from 4.2 percent in August.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla., said the employment data had the potential to give the Fed the impetus to raise rates even before its next meeting, which is on Nov. 16. "Yesterday, the Fed issued its bias- toward-tightening warning, and in my opinion it will indeed happen."
"Today the trading was thin, with some hedge-fund selling," he added. "But in reality, market participants were basically in a wait-and-see mode."
Yesterday, the Treasury auctioned $7 billion of 29 1/2-year Treasury inflation-indexed securities, or the reopening of the 3 7/8 percent 30-year inflation-indexed bond originally issued April 15, 1999. The auction itself was on the weak side as the bid-to-cover, an indication of demand, came in at 1.92 to 1. Traders said the bonds were awarded with a high yield of 4.138 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of inflation-indexed bonds:

HEADLINE: Support Grows in Congress for a Pension Overhaul Plan That Would Aid High Earners

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Support is growing quickly in Congress for a vast expansion of retirement tax breaks for business owners, executives and highly paid workers, moves that Republicans and Democrats alike say would be popular with voters.
The leading proposal, known as the Portman-Cardin Pension Reform Plan, has 148 sponsors and would raise the $10,000 limit on annual tax-deductible savings in 401(k) plans to $15,000 and, for those age 50 and older, to $20,000. 
 The stated goal is to include many more employees in retirement programs by making the plans more attractive to business owners and to simplify complex rules that are designed to make sure most workers share in the benefits.
Representative Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who is the plan's leading sponsor, says that more firms are opting for executive-only plans without tax breaks. "We need to try something new because the system we have isn't working," he said, "and we need to get more people covered."
But even the bill's co-sponsor acknowledges that it may not do that. Critics say the bill is actually little more than cover for a plan to shower new tax benefits on the rich.
One provision would allow businesses to cut pension benefits by as much as one-third for workers making less than $160,000 annually without reducing benefits for those earning more. Supporters say they expect few businesses to do that.
Norman Stein, a University of Alabama Law School pension specialist who analyzed the Portman-Cardin plan, said it "should be called the Retirement Reduction Act."
The bill's co-sponsor, Representative Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, said in a speech last week that the bill might not increase the number of people who would collect retirement benefits, but it had such strong support from business that it was worth giving its provisions a try.
Easing regulations and raising savings limits would make retirement plans more attractive to business owners, he said, and should be viewed as "part of an overall strategy that will eventually cover more people."
Mr. Cardin and Representative Rob Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, are circulating a letter among House Democrats urging them to support the bill. Mr. Andrews said "anything we do that increases contributions to retirement plans is a good thing."
Critics acknowledge tens of thousands of new retirement plans would be created if Portman-Cardin is enacted, but they fear that few lower-paid workers would benefit.
Daniel Halperin, a pension specialist at Harvard Law School, has estimated that the expanded tax breaks would let a person easily accumulate tax-deferred retirement benefits of $5 million, even if not one additional lower-paid worker got a dollar in benefits.
"This bill turns the concept of using tax benefits to expand retirement income security on its head," he said, adding that the proposal "while well intentioned and containing many good ideas, would on the whole do more harm than good."
Dianne Bennett of Buffalo, president of Hodgson, Russ, Andrews, Woods & Goodyear, the largest law firm in upstate New York, said that if the Portman-Cardin plan becomes law its likely effect "would be to expand retirement plans that benefit only owners of business and to dramatically reduce the benefits granted" to the rank and file.
Ms. Bennett, a pension specialist, cited examples from retirement plans that she has drafted for clients to show that most of the benefits already flow to a few highly paid employees, a situation that she said would worsen drastically if the proposals were enacted.
She added that "many of my clients will not like what I am saying or that I am saying it."
A senior Clinton Administration official said support for the proposal was spreading quickly among Democrats eager to tell voters that they have made an easily understandable improvement to the 401(k) plans.
The official said none of the lawmakers he had talked to seemed to understand the provisions that could harm workers.
Supporters and critics agree that the greatest need is to have more people collect benefits when they retire. Supporters have focused on how more people would be "covered" by such plans, a measure of how many people could potentially participate in a plan, rather than how many will actually collect benefits.
Both sides also agree that increasing the amounts that can be put away untaxed will encourage more savings in retirement plans. But critics say that the increase will be narrowly focused among those already saving the maximum.
Few workers are held back by the current $10,000 limit on tax-deferred 401(k) savings.
Only 4 to 11 percent of 401(k) plan participants save the maximum now, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington whose studies are regarded as the standard for the benefits industry. Workers save an average of $3,000 each in 401(k) plans, the institute estimated.
Portman-Cardin may be included in a bill to raise the minimum wage by a dollar, to $6.15, in two steps.
The additional $10,000 that older workers could save each year would add $360,000 to a retirement nest egg of someone who is 50 years old, retires at 65 and earns historic stock market returns.
Current law generally limits the total amount that a worker and an employer together can set aside in a retirement plan to 25 percent of pay up to a maximum of $30,000 of savings. Portman-Cardin would increase that to $45,000.
Another provision would let some people sock away their entire paycheck, where it would grow untaxed until the money is withdrawn in retirement. That option would be attractive to those who can live off investment income, such as dividends and capital gains, and to those two-income families who can live on one paycheck.
Raising benefits at the top means that 62 percent of the new tax breaks would flow to people in the top 10 percent income group, analysis using the Treasury Department's economic modeling software found.
The middle fifth of households would get just 3.2 percent of the tax breaks, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington advocacy group for the poor, which performed the analysis.
The Portman-Cardin plan has wide support from business organizations and is similar to proposals by Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican for whom the popular tax-free Roth IRA's are named.
The provision that most concerns critics would increase the maximum annual pay that can be considered in calculating pension benefits by 47 percent, to $235,000 from $160,000.
That would let highly paid business owners increase their own pension benefits by 47 percent without raising benefits for employees earning less than $160,000.
Alternatively, the provision would allow a business owner to collect the same number of dollars from the retirement plan for himself, while cutting retirement benefits by up to one-third for everyone making less than $160,000 a year.
But James Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy at the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans in Washington, said market forces should discourage that type of response.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Brazilian Politician Stirs Fear and Debate on Debt

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Investors in Brazil are beginning to get nervous over the future possibility that the Government might try to renegotiate its domestic debt, which has nearly doubled in recent years.
The possibility has grown in part because the idea of a debt renegotiation has been promoted by a rising presidential candidate, Ciro Gomes, a 41-year-old former Finance Minister. He has made debt renegotiation part of a broader economic proposal that, he says, would encourage long-term growth. 
 His proposal would lengthen the maturities and lower the interest payments on the domestic debt -- the Government bonds and notes that are denominated in the Brazilian currency, the real. By doing so, Mr. Gomes said, he hoped to narrow Brazil's growing budget deficit. He would also hope to redirect money now fueling profits at financial institutions that buy high-yielding Government bonds into areas in need like education, housing and jobs.
The idea has attracted a mixture of bemusement, anger and anxiety among Brazilian financiers, especially since Mr. Gomes's rising popularity makes him one of the main contenders in the presidential election, to be held in three years.
"This is a crazy idea that would cripple the economy, creating capital flight and bringing back the risk of inflation," said David Gotlib, managing director of Deutsche Bank Asset Management's Brazilian operations. "I can only hope the gravity of doing such a thing will be perceived in time for the proposal to be withdrawn."
With the election that far in the future, many things can obviously happen in the meantime. Still, Mr. Gomes's proposal has generated energetic discussion here over the dynamics of Brazil's domestic debt.
That debt is different from debt owed by the governments in advanced economies like the United States, which are able to sell bonds with maturities of up to 30 years. Brazil, by contrast, is only able to sell bonds domestically with maturities up to five years. And the average maturity of all Brazilian Government debt is only about nine months.
The main reason for such short maturities is a reluctance by investors to buy longer-maturing bonds, given a history over the last couple of decades of the national and some state governments reneging on obligations.
From 1982 to 1990, a period of hyperinflation and economic crisis, Brazil restructured its domestic debt three times. The last of these took place by surprise shortly after Fernando Collor de Mello became president in 1990, and the Government froze and then seized bank deposits.
"Brazil's track record is not particularly stellar in this regard," said Fergus McCormick, a debt analyst at the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Corporation.
A country's domestic debt rating is usually higher than the rating on its foreign debt, or debt owed in foreign currency to lenders in other countries. But in Brazil's case, Duff & Phelps rates its domestic debt B-, three notches below its foreign debt rating of BB-.
Some of the financiers' and bond analysts' apprehension reflects a worrisome growth of Brazilian domestic debt, which is held almost entirely by Brazilians. In the last two years, the domestic debt has ballooned to nearly 400 billion reais -- now about $205 billion -- from 210 billion reais. By contrast, the foreign debt grew 13 percent in the same period, to $97.4 billion.
The main reason for the near-doubling of the domestic debt load is the Government's reliance on bonds that pay a variable rate of interest. So when the central bank raised interest rates during the financial crises in Asia, Russia and earlier this year at home, debt-servicing costs soared.
And Brazil's debt makeup is still largely dependent on moves in interest rates, with more than half of domestic debt linked to the main overnight lending rate, now around 19 percent. An additional 26 percent of the debt is linked to the real's value in relation to the dollar. That means that a sharp weakening in the Brazilian currency would sharply increase the cost of servicing these bonds.
Mr. Gomes's debt-restructuring proposal reflects the thinking of Roberto Mangabeira Unger, a legal theorist who is his principal adviser. Mr. Unger, a Brazilian who has been teaching at Harvard Law School since 1971, argues that the nature of Brazil's domestic debt means that it is vulnerable to potential negative developments abroad, like a correction on Wall Street or apprehension over Year 2000 computer problems. Turbulence abroad could lead the Brazilian central bank to raise rates, which means that the Government's financing costs also rise.
"The Government has made a very dangerous bet by not considering the eventuality of an internal debt reorganization," Mr. Unger said in a telephone interview. "First, it means that almost the totality of projected federal revenue will be used in servicing the debt, and second, the commitments to economic opening and fiscal realism are put at risk."
Mr. Unger's views on Government finances and other subjects such as the possibility of using controls to limit short-term capital flows have been known for some time. But recently, they have gained prominence as Mr. Gomes, the 2002 presidential aspirant, became something of a darling in the Brazilian news media after his separation from his first wife and much-publicized romance with Patricia Pillar, a soap-opera actress.
Mr. Unger began to influence Mr. Gomes's thinking when the politician was a visiting scholar at Harvard in 1995.
Skeptics say that a debt renegotiation would be exceedingly complex and do more harm than good. Mailson da Nobrega, a former Finance Minister, said about 80 percent of Brazil's domestic debt is indirectly held by the country's middle class, either through mutual funds, pension funds or insurance policies backed by Government bonds. "How do you renegotiate with crowds that would fit into several soccer stadiums?" he asked rhetorically. "This is an idea thought up in a Harvard library, far from Brazilian reality."
Brazil's central bank has said that the debt situation is improving. For example, in August the Government was able to increase to 11.7 percent the share of debt that is not subject to variable rates, from 1.2 percent in March.
And with the authorities forecasting a decline in interest rates to single-digits next year, debt-servicing costs should decline, as a result.

HEADLINE: Lehigh Phoenix Rises From Big Steel's Ashes;
Eastern Pennsylvania Region Recovers By Turning to Technology Companies

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa.

 BODY:
When Christopher Reed left here nine years ago to study engineering at Penn State, he assumed he was gone for good. A steelworker's son, he had had firsthand experience with the havoc that the steady decline of Big Steel had wreaked on the area's job market. "I figured I'd be in California by now," Mr. Reed said.
Mr. Reed came back when he graduated in 1994, but only to use his parent's home as a base for job hunting. Five months later, though, he was working at QED, a Bethlehem company that makes gallium arsenide wafers for the semiconductor industry. 
 "I couldn't believe something like QED existed in my backyard," Mr. Reed, a systems engineer, said. "I just never thought of this as a high-tech area."
So much for the persistent perception of the Lehigh Valley -- where the economic woes were immortalized by Billy Joel in his angry 1982 ballad "Allentown" -- as a place whose time has come and gone. Just drive through the area, visit its schools, talk to its entrepreneurs. Lucent Technologies has even gone so far as to put up a billboard over nearby Route 22 proclaiming, "Move over, Silicon Valley, here comes Lehigh Valley."
That's certainly an exaggeration. Still, slowly but steadily, a high-technology phoenix is rising on the steel shards of Easton, Bethlehem and Allentown, the towns that make up the Lehigh Valley. The region's unemployment rate, which four years ago was 7.7 percent, is now only 3.7 percent, according to the August data. Some 65 high-technology companies have moved into the valley or been founded there in the last five years, representing 38,500 jobs -- or about 12 percent of the area's total employment. It is a striking example of the extent to which high technology is transforming some of the most damaged areas of the Rust Belt's industrial economy.
"We're getting past the stigma of the Billy Joel song," said Thomas A. Kucharski, president of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation. "We're breaking through the perception that this area is coal and cows, and gray and brown."
A survey by a state-financed economic agency indicates that technology companies accounted for 3,500 new jobs in the valley last year, and are expected to create another 4,000 over the next two years.
Lucent, the communications equipment maker that is the area's biggest technology employer, has gone from 5,000 jobs in the region in 1996 to 5,600 today. It will have 5,900 here after it finishes expanding a plant in nearby Breinigsville and completes a $165 million divisional headquarters complex in Allentown in 2001.
Newcomers include Computer Aid, a computer software developer with 1,200 employees; AANetcom, a small chip maker founded two years ago by a former Bell Laboratories scientist; STC Technologies, a developer of medical products for testing immune-system problems, which employs 85 people, and Applied Separations Inc., a producer of advanced biotechnology laboratory equipment, with 62 employees.
But the drawn-out erosion of the steel industry has left its scars. At its 1950's peak, Bethlehem Steel employed 30,000 people in a five-mile stretch of steelmaking plants here. When it closed its last local plant last year, the work force had dwindled to 800. Many of the workers found jobs with other local companies, but the pay was nowhere near the $30 an hour they had made with Big Steel, let alone the 13 weeks of paid vacation and full package of health benefits they had once had.
Steel's demise meant the end of a way of a life. By the early 1980's, for the first time in more than 100 years, sons could no longer follow fathers into the steelworker's life.
"There was a noticeable and painful flight of young people from this entire area," recalled Bruce E. Davis, a former Bethlehem Steel lawyer who is now in private practice.
Many of those who returned still feel pangs for the old days. "I look at the blast furnaces now, and what strikes me most is the eerie silence," said Jeffrey Lowmaster, a 41-year-old former steelworker who left the Lehigh Valley when he was laid off in 1982, got some technology training, and returned last year to a technician's job at QED.
He is not alone. Last month a local theater group used the skeleton of an old steel mill as the backdrop for a play called "Steelbound," which dramatized how widespread the longing for the old life was.
"Seeing the plant as a ghost town, flat tracts and rubble where buildings used to be, was even sadder than the day we closed the forge," said Leonard Christman, a former steelworker who acted in the play.
But, Mr. Christman noted, the play ended with a strong message: "It's time to stop looking back, and to move on."
And that, clearly, is what the region is doing. "We saw high, we saw low, and now we're seeing high again," said David Hartzell, a 26-year-old steelworker's son who is director of operations for QED, which employs 70 people.
The change is tangible. Easton is metamorphosing into an art and tourist center, home to several galleries and two interactive children's museums. Allentown, which has suffered badly from middle-class flight to the suburbs, is being reborn as a government and financial center, with a large dab of high technology.
And, of course, there is Lucent's planned new group headquarters.
"We've been adding people for the last few years, and we're finally ready to put down bricks and mortar," said John T. Dickson, the president of Lucent's $3 billion Microelectronics Group, the division that makes electronic components here. The region's drawing cards, Mr. Dickson said, include scenic countryside and affordable housing. And Lucent's Route 22 billboard notwithstanding, Mr. Dickson sees benefit in the fact that the Lehigh Valley does not really rival other high-technology centers.
"We couldn't attract good people if we were the only high-tech company in town," he said. "But it's still harder for our talent to walk out the door to a new job than it would be in Silicon Valley."
The renaissance is most apparent in Bethlehem, once the heart of the steel district. New restaurants and boutiques are replacing ramshackle businesses on Third Street, the main drag. And it is not possible to eat at the Apollo Grill, a new midpriced trendy restaurant, without a reservation. "In the old days, it would have opened and closed in a week," said Donald T. Cunningham Jr., Bethlehem's Mayor and a steelworker's son.
Bethlehem Steel still makes its world headquarters here, even though its closest steel mill is now in Steelton, Pa., about 100 miles west. Meanwhile, the old steelmaking site -- at 1,800 acres, the largest singly owned "brownfield," or environmentally troublesome site, under redevelopment in the country -- is being reincarnated.
The company has spent nearly $25 million on cleaning up and marketing the site, but has priced the parcels low enough so that they are selling quickly. "We're not trying to profit from redevelopment; we'd love it if we break even," said Curtis H. Barnette, the company's chairman since 1992. "Our goal is to bring our site back to decent use."
The new uses include a museum of industry run by the Smithsonian Institution, an entertainment park with skating rink and swimming pool, a transportation center where shipments are switched between trucks and rail cars, a hotel and conference center, and a commerce center for light manufacturing.
Mr. Barnette said he expected the various operations that occupy the old steelmaking site to eventually provide 10,000 jobs.
Separately, the company has helped finance five industrial parks on Bethlehem's outskirts that have become homes to some 400 small businesses, and to a mix of 14,000 technology and nontechnology jobs. A sixth industrial park is under construction,
All along the valley, meanwhile, dozens of companies with ties to the fast-growing semiconductor chip industry have sprung up. Many have been helped along by the state-financed Ben Franklin Technology Center, an incubator for new companies and a nurturer for small ones trying to grow big.
"Without Ben Franklin's help, we'd have never found financing to get started," said William H. Weisbecker, a co-founder of QED, which recently merged with a Welsh company to form a $35 million multinational called IQE P.L.C., whose stock trades on the Brussels exchange.
The Ben Franklin Center was one of various initiatives promoted in the early 1980's by Pennsylvania's Republican Governor at the time, Richard L. Thornburgh. While it was clear that steel was on the way out, Governor Thornburgh defied the conventional wisdom by refusing to woo other types of heavy industry with the promise of tax breaks and land, concentrating instead on attracting small companies with growth potential.
"He said, 'Let's not chase smokestacks, let's turn our resources into something with a future,' " said Mark Lang, the Ben Franklin Center's executive director.
High technology was not an outlandish choice. The first transistor was manufactured in Allentown in 1951 by Western Electric, the old AT&T manufacturing arm, which originally came to the area because of its proximity to New York and Philadelphia and to AT&T's Bell Labs, 60 miles away in Murray Hill, N.J. And there was Lehigh University. Today, many of the current start-ups are run by Lehigh alumni.
"It made sense to set up near a high concentration of technical talent," said John F. Plunkett, a Lehigh graduate and a co-founder of Millbrook Inc., a new Bethlehem company that provides software to the insurance industry. Milbrook rents office space from Lehigh, and employs many Lehigh students as interns.
Lehigh University itself is undergoing a transformation of sorts. To counter its lingering reputation as a bastion of manufacturing skills, it is beefing up its liberal arts offerings, and will soon introduce a bioengineering course. It also is setting its students up with internships and consulting jobs at local technology companies. "Most of our graduates still don't stay in the area, but we'd like them to," said Gregory C. Farrington, Lehigh's president.
The changes in Bethlehem's local schools are more dramatic. The school district was never particularly starved for cash, since Bethlehem -- unlike Allentown and many other American cities -- has put its affluent suburban and inner city schools under the same district umbrella. But, in the steel-supremacy days, it was not under pressure to provide a good education.
"Everyone knew you could be a high school dropout and have a middle-class life style, that you could lean on a broom and make $15 an hour," said Thomas Doliusio, the district superintendent for the last 13 years. "Our minimum requirements for graduation were too minimum."
Not anymore. Three years ago Mr. Doliusio began what he calls an "international benchmarking" project, to glean educational tips from Japan and other countries. He has since introduced new ways to teach English and math, as well as intensified reading skills programs. He has instituted a stringent code of conduct that has resulted in the expulsion of 100 children "whose behavior interfered with our efficiency," he said.
The cost has been high. "Many teachers retired, and we've spent millions to train others," he said. "And we've had to de-emphasize social studies and science and music. But gosh darn it, our kids will know how to read!"
Such pragmatism notwithstanding, the area's transformation is far from complete. Mr. Barnette, the Bethlehem Steel chairman, says it will take more than a decade to complete all of the changes planned for his shuttered plants. There are still many rutted, muddy roads on and around the site.
And, according to Mayor Cunningham, while enough companies have come in to keep the tax base from declining, "it's stayed flat when our expenses have kept going up."
Indeed, even as he stood at the window of his office and surveyed the reborn town of Bethlehem, there was an air of nostalgic wistfulness in Mayor Cunningham's voice. "My job would be a lot easier," he conceded, "if there were a working steel plant out there."

HEADLINE: Jordan's New King Assuming Key Role in Mideast Talks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Not long ago, King Abdullah planned a quick trip abroad, to Vermont, to serve as best man at the wedding of a Deerfield Academy classmate. 
 But in another reminder of his new role as a pivotal player in the high-wire world of Middle Eastern peacemaking, his autumn weekend in New England soon blossomed into an official visit to the United States, his second in just five months.
This afternoon, accompanied by the American ambassador here, King Abdullah flew off for a long week of Washington meetings capped by a session at the White House. He carried with him, somewhat ambivalently, a private message for President Clinton, one that had been delivered to him here this week by an emissary of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq -- another of Jordan's problematic neighbors -- even though the King says has no illusions about any imminent improvement in Iraqi-American relations.
The King is to discuss Jordan's military needs with Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and duty-free access to the American market with Commerce Secretary William Daley. He will brief the president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, on his ambitious economic reform plans -- a prerequisite for further multilateral financing -- and promote Jordan's potential as a high-tech, low-wage industrial haven to computer entrepreneurs in Virginia and Massachusetts.
And he hopes to prod Congress to release a promised $200 million financial package that would make Jordan the second biggest recipient of economic aid per capita, after Israel.
But his main goal is to maintain the momentum toward the broad regional peace settlement that he considers the key to Jordan's security and economic recovery.
"If Syria doesn't resolve the problem with Israel, then we pay the price," he said before departing today. "If Israel doesn't resolve the problem with the Palestinians, again Jordan will pay the price."
Despite those concerns, Abdullah leaves behind a country increasingly comfortable with the ambitious and self-assured leadership style of a 37-year-old ruler who was barely known when he suddenly and unexpectedly ascended to the throne last February.
And his surprising willingness to break with some of the policies of his revered father, King Hussein, is already reshaping Jordan's regional alliances and domestic agenda in ways that his Arab neighbors and American policymakers both find welcome.
In a wide-ranging conversation today with a small group of European, American and Israeli journalists, King Abdullah sketched out his views on the state of the peace talks and Jordan's changing role as a regional intermediary.
He is guardedly optimistic about negotiations between Syria and Israel, despite outward signs that an initially positive dialogue has degenerated into a sterile exchange of old and incompatible bargaining gambits.
"Actually, I think things are moving along better than the atmosphere suggests," he said, citing his continuing contacts as "a middle man or mediator" with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and, through the King's son, with President Hafez al-Assad.
"What the Syrians were saying and what the Israelis were saying were really pretty much the same things," he said. "They were both in the same ballpark, and what we did was to try to get the messages to either party. As they start to sit down -- the Syrians with the Israelis, the Syrians with the Americans -- then we have done what we needed to do, and Jordan will pull out."
But he said he shared the concerns of many Arab leaders that Israeli peace talks with Syria could overshadow the much more complex and, in his view, far more important talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
"Peace with Syria is not peace with the Arab world," the King said.
"The Arab world cannot warm towards Israel if you do not solve the Palestinian issue, and there are many countries that want a warm relationship."
An admirer of Mr. Barak, King Abdullah nonetheless warned that his decision to press for a comprehensive final settlement, even at the expense of negotiating delays, is being misinterpreted as deliberate procrastination.
"When Barak won the election, maybe some people don't want to admit it, but there was a euphoria all over the Middle East," he said. "You had the Syrians coming out of their shell, believing in Barak and believing in Israel."
Mr. Barak wanted "to make something that would last, that would actually make the Palestinians happier than what we had achieved in Washington," the King said. "He had good intentions in his heart. But the perception in the Middle East was, this was further delay, and that maybe this was not the man that we all thought he was."
Despite his desire to expedite talks between Israel and the Palestinians, King Abdullah rejects any direct role.
He has said the Palestinians should take administrative control of the Muslim holy sites of Jerusalem, which still remain formally in his family's traditional charge. Unlike his father, he defers to Yasir Arafat, president of the Palestinian Authority, as the sole leader of the Palestinian people, except, of course, for the two million Palestinians who remain citizens of Jordan.
"We have had good relationships with Arafat from Day 1," he said. "We want to make sure that the Israelis and the Palestinians have the best atmosphere to move forward with the peace process."
Yet he curtly rejects the notion of an eventual confederation between Jordan and an independent Palestinian state, an idea resuscitated recently by Mr. Arafat, but which many Jordanians fear would spell the end of an independent Hashemite-led state here.
"There is no such word as confederation in my vocabulary," King Abdullah said.
When he assumed the throne last February, Abdullah portrayed himself as the keeper of the flame, as the custodian of his father's complex political and diplomatic legacy. But within months he began changing some of the terms of that inheritance.
He sought reconciliation with his father's old adversaries in Syria and Kuwait and an end to testy rivalries with Egypt and the Palestinian Authority. Domestically, he began revamping an entrenched political order that enriched an Amman elite but effectively disenfranchised the Palestinian majority. He has insisted on free-market reforms that will prepare Jordan for entry into the World Trade Organization, perhaps as soon as next year, but which will also threaten local business monopolies that prospered during his father's reign.
His most dramatic break came last month, when he ordered the arrests of the local leaders of Hamas, the radical Islamist Palestinian group that King Hussein had long tolerated as a counterweight to Mr. Arafat and as a concession to Jordanian Islamists, who also oppose peace with Israel.
But senior officials here now portray the Jordanian branch of Hamas as a renegade terrorist operation supported by Iranian intelligence and conspiring against Hamas leaders within the Palestinian territories. Mr. Arafat repeatedly asked the new Jordanian Government to take action against the group, foreign diplomats and senior Jordanian officials said.
"Jordan has made itself quite clear that Hamas offices will be shut down in Jordan, and that is what will happen," King Abdullah said today.

Dividend Increases Slow Even as the Economy Soars
If the measure of corporate America's financial health is its ability and willingness to increase dividends to shareholders, then the country might appear to be in a recession. Standard & Poor's reports that 117 companies announced dividend increases in September, 10 fewer than in the month a year earlier.
That was the 15th consecutive month that the number of dividend increases was down year-over-year. By itself, such a long string of relative bad news is not extraordinary. What is unusual is that the economy is doing so well even while companies are growing more reluctant to raise their dividends. Floyd Norris: Market Place. Page C11. 

Support Grows for Some Tax Breaks
Support is growing in Congress for a vast expansion of retirement tax breaks for business owners, executives and highly paid workers, moves that Republicans and Democrats alike think would be popular with voters. C7.
 
Earnings Rise 6.7% at Pepsico
Pepsico reported a 6.7 percent increase in third-quarter profit on the strength of higher earnings at its Frito-Lay and Tropicana units, a performance that beat analysts' estimates by one cent a share. The announcement sent the stock prices of both Pepsico and its archrival, Coca-Cola, higher. Shares of Pepsico rose $1.75, or 5.6 percent, to $33.1875. Coke rose $4, to $51.9375. C5.

Stocks Gain as Rate Worries Ease
Stocks rose as investors shifted their attention to earnings and away from the prospect of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 187.75 points, or 1.81 percent, to 10,588.34. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 24.05 points, or 1.85 percent, to 1,325.40. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 57.54 points, or 2.06 percent, to 2,857.21. C10.

Debate Is Stirred on Debt in Brazil
Investors in Brazil are beginning to get nervous over the possibility that the Government might try to renegotiate its domestic debt, which has nearly doubled in recent years. The possibility has grown in part because the idea of a debt renegotiation has been promoted by a rising presidential candidate, Ciro Gomes, a 41-year-old former Finance Minister. He has made debt renegotiation part of a broader economic plan that he says would encourage long-term growth. C4.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Begins Rewriting Rules For Industryin Consolidation

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Federal officials this week began setting the conditions they will impose on a wave of proposed mergers that promises to consolidate, blur and redefine the nation's phone, cable and broadcast industries in a matter of months.
Today, the Federal Communications Commission approved SBC Communications Inc.'s $72 billion takeover of the Ameritech Corporation, but imposed conditions that officials said were intended to force SBC to be more competitive with other regional and local phone companies. 
 On Friday, the agency is set to announce new ownership-concentration rules for cable television companies that will determine whether the AT&T Corporation can complete its $58 billion acquisition of Mediaone Group without shedding any assets.
And yesterday, William E. Kennard, the F.C.C. chairman, questioned how MCI Worldcom Inc.'s $115 billion bid for the Sprint Corporation could benefit consumers, suggesting the companies had to shed Internet components and long-distance properties to gain regulatory approval.
F.C.C. officials said today that in drawing the lines on these deals and a handful of others -- valued at almost $250 billion in all -- the commission was trying to balance economies of scale, which could result in lower prices to consumers, against large-scale consolidations, which could result in less competition and higher prices.
"We are certainly not per se against consolidations, particularly those that achieve the kinds of economies of scale that can help consumers," Mr. Kennard said in an interview today. "On the other hand, we are against those consolidations that raise the barriers to entry by competitors."
One issue complicating the deliberations of Mr. Kennard and the F.C.C. is the state of local telephone service, which in many pockets of the nation has remained largely resistant to competition.
In broadly deregulating the industry, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required that regional Bell companies seeking to enter the highly lucrative long-distance business must first establish that there is true competition in their local service areas. To promote that provision, the commission required San Antonio-based SBC, as part of its merger with Chicago-based Ameritech, to enter 30 cities outside its region within 18 months or else face fines of more than $1 billion.
Today, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman of SBC, said in an interview that Texas regulators had notified SBC that it had shown sufficient local competition to qualify to offer long-distance service in Texas. Mr. Whitacre said he expected SBC would be filing an application with the F.C.C. in coming weeks to offer long distance to Texas customers.
"This is an interesting, exciting and great day," Mr. Whitacre said. "We've worked long and hard for this."
SBC's previous application to the F.C.C. to be allowed to enter the $80 billion long-distance market failed. But Mr. Whitacre said that the consolidation resulting from the MCI Worldcom-Sprint deal would place greater pressure on Washington regulators to open the long-distance market to the Bells.
"The obvious answer to all this," he said, "is let everybody do everything."
Today's action by the F.C.C. means that the seven Baby Bells originally created by the breakup of the old American Telephone & Telegraph Company will soon be reduced to four. And if MCI Worldcom's deal for Sprint, which is based in Westwood, Kan., is approved, four dominant long-distance carriers will be reduced to two.
Mr. Kennard's remarks about the acquisitions by MCI Worldcom, based in Jackson, Miss., and SBC were notable for more than what they said about the deals themselves. The resulting level of concentration would be stunning, not only for the telephone industry, but also for the broadcast and cable industries.
Two other deals now before the commission -- Viacom Inc.'s acquisition of the CBS Corporation and AT&T's purchase of Mediaone, a cable television services company based in Englewood, Colo., close on the heels of its purchase of Telecommunications Inc. -- would break the current caps that were supposed to limit market domination. In general terms, no more than 30 percent of either industry can be controlled by one company, and both mergers far exceed that.
There is a strong expectation that the F.C.C. and the Justice Department's antitrust division will, at the very least, require some of these deals to be significantly scaled back by requiring the sale of major components of the companies as a condition of regulatory approval.
On Friday, the commission is set to hand down new cable-concentration rules, and the industry is watching whether the agency will relax its standards to permit AT&T to complete the acquisition of Mediaone.
Mr. Kennard and other officials at the F.C.C. also suggested that the rules under consideration for the cable industry might be different from those for other industries. That is because a convergence of telecommunications, computer and broadcasting technologies enables cable companies to offer TV programs, high-speed Internet access and telephone services over a single cable.
The officials said the aim of the rules to be announced on Friday would be to prevent further consolidation of traditional cable service -- television -- while encouraging AT&T and its smaller competitors to continue to invest heavily in developing networks capable of offering high-speed Internet and telephone services as well.
"The cable industry is both mature and moving into a new market, trying to compete with the Bells in local telephone and broad-band telephony," Mr. Kennard said. "It's like the Yankees baseball team deciding that they want to now compete in basketball. You want them to be competitive. At the same time, you don't want to give them the ability to totally dominate their traditional market."

MCI-Sprint Breakup Fee
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 (Reuters) -- If MCI Worldcom Inc. or the Sprint Corporation walks away from their $115 billion merger, the one who walks away must pay the other a $2.5 billion breakup fee, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

HEADLINE: U.N. Governance in East Timor

 BODY:
To avoid months of chaos in East Timor, Secretary General Kofi Annan wants the United Nations to take full control of the territory and spend the next two to three years readying it for independence. This is a timely and constructive proposal that deserves Washington's encouragement.
The forces opposed to independence, Indonesia's military and its allied militias, were too slow to let go of East Timor. By contrast, Indonesia's civil administration -- the police, the judges, the officials who ran the water and electric utilities -- disappeared too fast. That has left hundreds of thousands of Timorese civilians, already suffering from last month's violence, facing prolonged social and economic disruption. 
 Mr. Annan's plan could shorten this dangerous interlude. The U.N. must be careful about taking on new responsibilities that could overwhelm its budget and its capacities. But if Mr. Annan chooses a capable administrator, East Timor's transition problems should be manageable. Moreover, there are no attractive alternatives to U.N. rule.
Under Mr. Annan's proposal, the U.N. administrator would promulgate new laws and create an internationally run administration, supported by 8,000 to 9,000 U.N. peacekeepers. These would replace the current Australian-led international peacekeeping unit. Australia did much to restore security in East Timor. But the forceful tactics of its commanders have stirred resentment in Asia, and Australia now wants a lower profile.
There are potential obstacles. The operation could cost as much as $1 billion, of which the United States would be expected to pay roughly 25 percent. Congress may bridle, but should recognize that U.N. inaction could prove even more expensive. Meanwhile, Mr. Annan and his administrator must not let themselves be pushed around by members of the Security Council or the U.N.'s bureaucracy.
East Timor became a U.N. responsibility with this summer's referendum on independence. The sequel to that vote was violence, followed by a power vacuum. The immediate crisis has been overcome. The challenge now is to fill the vacuum with an effective governing apparatus until the East Timorese are ready to rule themselves.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Son-in-Law at Center Of Rich Network of Influence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: OMSK, Russia, Oct. 6

 BODY:
It is three hours by air from Moscow to Omsk, a sprawling collection of fraying low-rises set on a Kansas-flat plain by the oil fields of Siberia. Every month or two, a well-dressed, bespectacled young man arrives by commercial jet here and is whisked away to a corporate apartment not far from the Omsk Oil Refinery, Russia's largest and most modern petroleum complex. After a day or two of unspecified business, he leaves as he came.
Virtually nobody in this city of 1.2 million people would notice, except for his name: Leonid Dyachenko, the husband of President Boris N. Yelt sin's daughter and right-hand strategist, Tatyana Dyachenko. 
 Once so anonymous that even prying reporters were unsure of his first name, the 36-year-old Mr. Dyachenko turns out to have a colorful life.
He popped into the headlines two weeks ago when it was disclosed that he had a bank account in the Cayman Islands with more than $2 million. His bank is the Bank of New York, which is at the center of an investigation into possible money laundering in the United States.
Mr. Dyachenko is an oil trader. But he is more than that. He is a participant -- if not a key figure -- in a network of politically blessed companies that ship Siberian oil products to Ukraine and to Eastern Europe.
His work is all the more colorful because, for many oil traders, oil is almost an afterthought. Virtually all of Russia's oil giants use creative financial transactions to ship billions of dollars offshore -- beyond the reach of tax collectors and, for that matter, company shareholders.
Of most interest to investigators tracing the billions of dollars that have flowed out of Russia this decade are Mr. Dyachenko's bank accounts, which apparently got most of their money from his dealings with oil companies, according to statements by bank officials.
The officials of those companies, and Mr. Dyachenko's benefactors, include two Russian tycoons who are among Mr. Yeltsin's strongest supporters, Boris A. Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, as well as the son of the autocratic pro-Yeltsin governor of the Omsk region.
Mr. Dyachenko's operations stretch from Omsk to Moscow to Manhattan, where he is allied with a frenetic Russian capitalist named Viktor Y. Khrolenko and, records indicate, seems to have occupied a luxury apartment overlooking New York's financial district.
Mr. Khrolenko, who set up two oil trading companies that employed Mr. Dyachenko and who befriended the Yeltsin family, said in an interview that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had seized his records and that he was recently summoned to appear next Thursday before a Federal grand jury looking into Russian financial dealings in the United States. Through a lawyer, he denied any wrongdoing. The Kremlin has refused in the past to discuss Mr. Dyachenko.
And nothing so far links Mr. Dyachenko to any of the now-infamous companies, like Benex International, that have been indicted on charges of illegally moving nearly $7 billion from Russia through Bank of New York accounts over the last three and a half years.
Still, Mr. Dyachenko's business in Omsk and Manhattan raises questions throughout Moscow about his lucrative relationships with business tycoons who have profited from the personal intervention of Mr. Dyachenko's father-in-law, President Yeltsin.
Less clear is the true role of Mr. Khrolenko, an engaging but curious wheeler-dealer who seems to have played midwife on both sides of the ocean to Mr. Dyachenko's oil career.
Tall, good-looking and energetic, Mr. Khrolenko was a Russian capitalist before Russian capitalism was cool, much less before it overheated. "Viktor was one of those guys who asked me to smuggle him a copy of Samuelson's book on economics in '78 or '79," said Jonathan Sanders, a Columbia University professor who is a godfather to one of Mr. Khrolenko's grandchildren. "He's a real Russian patriot who just wanted to bring some American things into his country."
By the time Communism collapsed, Mr. Khrolenko had hooked up with a onetime promoter for the Rolling Stones to secure a CBS recording contract for a Russian rock band and bring Soviet newscasts to the Discovery Channel. He started, then sold, an American-style nightclub, Manhattan Express, in a staid hotel near Red Square, and published books on Russian art and literature.
His corporate umbrella, Belka International, had annual sales of more than than $100 million in 1992, according to a Moscow business newspaper. A more recent report, by Dun & Bradstreet, places recent sales at close to $30 million.
Mr. Sanders believes that Mr. Khrolenko had met Mr. Yeltsin by the late 1980's, when Mr. Yeltsin was gaining the image of a Communist reformer. And Mr. Khrolenko suggested that he met Mr. Yeltsin's son-in-law through a timber deal in the early 1990's.
What is clear is that in 1993, the Kremlin called Andrew Nurnberg, Mr. Yeltsin's literary agent in London, and said Mr. Khrolenko would negotiate the American rights to Mr. Yeltsin's autobiography.
"I heard he was desperate to be seen with Yeltsin," Mr. Nurnberg said in a telephone interview. "That was in those days when you could benefit by being close to the President of Russia."
Peter Osnos, then the publisher of Times Books, a division of Random House, and now the publisher at Public Affairs, a nonfiction publishing house, said Mr. Yeltsin's book was excellent -- and that the American edition never made a penny.
In an interview, he recalled attending a spectacular Kremlin dinner to celebrate the unveiling of the book at which Mr. Khrolenko sat with the presidential family. "What happened to him after that, I don't know," he said.
Part of what happened is that Mr. Khrolenko went from publishing to petroleum -- and Russian politics. By the spring of 1994, when Mr. Yelt sin's book appeared in the United States, Mr. Khrolenko's Belka was peddling its services at a Washington conference on Russian technology, opened by Vice President Al Gore.
Among others there was the governor of Omsk region, Leonid Polezhayev. A participant, who refused to be identified for fear of retribution, said Mr. Khrolenko was actively promoting oil and gas deals in the area, and that Governor Polezhayev was at his side. "They hugged each other like old friends," the person said. "I think they'd known each other for a long time."
A huge deal was soon sealed, but it did not directly involve Mr. Khrolenko.
Under a Government program known as loans for shares, the Kremlin elected to sell off effective control of the Omsk Oil Refinery, the city's biggest employer, to the highest bidder. That triggered a bitter battle that ended when the chief opponent of the plan, the refinery's general director, was found dead in Omsk's Irtysh River a week before the company's auction.
The winner of the auction was the huge Siberian Oil Company, known as Sibneft. Its ownership is murky at best, but most analysts say control rests with the company's general director, Mr. Abramovich (pronounced ah-bra-MO-vich), and his longtime business ally, Mr. Berezovsky, perhaps Russia's richest and most public business titan.
The Sibneft acquisition appears to have been good news for both Mr. Khrolenko and Mr. Dyachenko. Sibneft began selling its refined Siberian oil through a network of oil traders. At the top of Sibneft's list were two companies: a Khrolenko creation called Belka Energy of New York, and a second, better-known Russian company called Runikom.
By all accounts, Mr. Dyachenko has either overseen or played a leading role in Belka's dealings with the Omsk refinery. A vice president of Runikom, which itself holds a 10 percent share of Sibneft, is none other than Aleksei Polezhayev, the son of the Omsk governor.
The incestuous nature of the ties is clear from the location of Belka's Moscow office: in the refurbished building that houses representatives of the Omsk regional government.
As a practical matter, Sibneft seems to have awarded the relatives of Mr. Yeltsin and a key supporter lucrative contracts to distribute its petroleum products. Just how lucrative is not clear; Sibneft, one of the world's biggest oil companies, still does not have to disclose its internal business dealings.
Mr. Khrolenko's lawyer, Irwin Rochman, said in a lengthy interview that Mr. Khrolenko's companies are legitimate and that Mr. Dyachenko, who has an undisclosed "relationship" with them, "has been compensated handsomely" for his work.
But it is unclear what Mr. Dyachenko does.
According to an account by one petroleum expert in Omsk, which is impossible to verify, Belka and a second Khrolenko company run by Mr. Dyachenko, East Coast Petroleum, move about 10,000 tons of diesel fuel from Omsk each month. Most goes to former Soviet satellites like Hungary and Croatia; increasingly, some goes to Ukraine.
"It's crumbs, mere crumbs," the expert said. Like many experts, he characterized the allotment as a political favor, much as a powerful American company might suddenly choose to hire the unexceptional son of a congressman or a governor.
But the sums involved -- and the profits -- can be immense. The vast majority of Russian oil giants effectively launder their oil through a network of offshore companies -- some wholly owned subsidiaries, others controlled by favored friends -- to avoid taxes.
The Russian Government places a 20 percent value-added tax on every ton of exported oil or gas. In the simplest scheme, an oil company agrees to sell its crude to a foreign trader for slightly below the market price, thereby understating its profit and paying less tax. The trader then resells the oil at market prices and agrees to split the profit with his supplier.
Most important, the unreported profit stays offshore. "If you have an offshore entity, you can declare less income and pay less taxes -- excise, profit, corporate or income tax," said an executive of one major Western company.
The rake-off goes largely to feed official corruption, lining the pockets of politicians and company officials. In particular, both Russian and foreign oil executives say, the Government's energy and fuel ministry -- which controls oil exports -- is almost brazenly corrupt.
Even officially, the Government does little to conceal the practice. In 1997, a banner year for oil exports, nearly half of the 97 million tons of crude oil exports were sent -- on paper, at least -- to tax havens like Gibraltar, Lichtenstein and the Bahamas, many without refineries.
A review of Russian customs records by a Russian petroleum newsletter turned up no evidence that either Belka or East Coast Petroleum had received oil exports in the last two years. That could be literally true. But experts say it is possible that the two companies could be placed further offshore in a chain of transactions beyond the reach of Russian tax collectors.
In Omsk, where at least some of the records exist, even those in the know do not want to talk about it.
Journalists who have challenged Governor Polezhayev's rule have found themselves under investigation.
In one interview this week, a subject removed the batteries from a mobile telephone, explaining calmly that this would prevent the security police from monitoring the interview. The governor's office declined a reporter's request to discuss these and other issues.
"The less you know," said one man who declined to delve deeply into Belka's history, "the longer you live."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
A Republican Sees an Issue: Education

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
WHEN the Rev. Floyd Flake introduced George W. Bush to New York's conservative establishment Tuesday, it was probably the first time in the history of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research that a luncheon speaker was described as "my homeboy." And that was not the most incongruous moment of the day for a Republican from Texas.
Mr. Bush visited an elementary school in Harlem, advocated spending more Federal money on education and sounded a little like Hillary Rodham Clinton during his luncheon speech at the New York Sheraton. He didn't mention anything about a village, but he did declare passionately: "Our nation has a moral duty to insure that no child -- I mean no child -- is left behind." 
 Could a Republican really be serious about education? Many voters, especially in New York, would dismiss Mr. Bush's compassionate rhetoric as political pandering. In a way it was, but not necessarily in the way that voters think.
When asked which party can do a better job of improving schools, voters overwhelmingly prefer Democrats, according to a poll by the Pugh Research Center. The Democrats have long been admired for their determination to allocate more money to public schools.
Adjusted for inflation, spending on the average American public school pupil has doubled in the last three decades, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But the money has not brought obvious improvement. As a result, many reformers are considering bigger changes, like the charter schools and voucher plans that New York's Republicans have been championing.
Local Democrats and union leaders have put up fierce resistance, but these reforms seem to be gaining favor, especially outside New York. The current issue of Blueprint, the journal of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, wholeheartedly endorses charter schools and advises Democrats to "stop opposing school reform ideas just because some Republicans like them."
There were plenty of those ideas in Mr. Bush's speech: reduce regulation of schools, make them compete for dollars and students, finance the construction of charter schools, get money directly to students and parents. It left the conservatives buzzing about education as a possible new wedge issue.
Like the Reagan Democrats who had defected over the issues of crime and welfare, and the Republican soccer moms driven to President Clinton by their party's stance against abortion, maybe Democratic parents could flee to a Republican promising better schools.
Maybe the National Education Association could turn into the Democrats' version of the Christian Coalition: a powerful special interest that alienates voters. Teachers keep the party opposed to vouchers, but they don't cast as many votes as parents and grandparents, whose support for school vouchers has been growing. Support is especially strong among Hispanic and black voters, whose defection would be a major blow to Democrats. Mr. Flake's enthusiasm for Mr. Bush may not be shared yet by many of his fellow African-Americans, but his support for vouchers is.
AFTER listening to Mr. Bush's pleas, the conservative intellectuals and business leaders could righteously believe their candidate to be standing up for children and the working classes. But there was an underlying problem with the speech.
However much conservatives may want to rescue children, they usually do not think that any President can do the job. They favor local control of schools. After arguing for the devolution of power -- the liberation of New York City's schools from the bureaucrats in Albany and at the Board of Education headquarters in Brooklyn -- it's inconsistent for them to put great faith in any reform coming out of Washington.
And however much Mr. Bush wants to reform schools as President, he won't have the money or the power to do it. The Federal Government provides only 8 percent of the money spent in public schools. Like crime, the issue is far more important on the campaign trail than in the Oval Office.
So perhaps the speech was mainly an exercise in political finesse: a demonstration that a Republican could learn the Clintonesque art of co-opting the other side's symbolic issue. Mr. Clinton had demonstrated how to win by sounding tough on crime. Now Mr. Bush was looking for victory by sounding soft on education.

HEADLINE: Poverty Rate Persists in City Despite Boom

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Despite the strongest economy in years, nearly one out of four New York City residents had incomes below the Federal Government's poverty threshold last year, a rate that has barely dipped since the last recession and that is twice as high as the national average, a new analysis of poverty in the city concludes.
The analysis, based on figures from house-to-house surveys by the Census Bureau, was released yesterday by the Community Service Society of New York, an advocacy group for the poor that has been tracking city poverty rates for decades. But the finding that the city's economic boom is not lifting the poor along with the well off echoes recent studies by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 "This is the best economy the country has seen since the late 60's," said Mark K. Levitan, who analyzed the census data for the Community Service Society. "It's not going to get any better than this. And we're still in a situation where a quarter of the city's population is in poverty."
Nationally, for the third year since 1994, more than a million Americans moved above the poverty line, defined as below $16,665 a year for a household of four. But in New York City, where the recovery has been gathering steam since 1996, 1.8 million are officially poor, or 24.3 percent, as many or more than in the early 1990's, during the last recession.
Rae Rosen, regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the Community Service Society's findings on poverty should be understood in light of the city's 6.9 percent unemployment rate, which remains high compared with 4.5 percent for the nation, as well as its high rate of immigration, which adds to a mismatch between the low level of skills and education of the least successful job seekers and the rising demands of new service jobs.
"I would agree that there are a group of people at the very bottom that have been bypassed by this economy that has been pretty robust," Ms. Rosen said.
But Giuliani administration officials disputed the significance of the figures, noting the number of jobs created in recent years and their efforts to move New Yorkers from welfare to work "The quality of life in New York City is higher than it's been in years," said Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "Three hundred and thirty thousand new jobs have been created in the last five years, as opposed to the 320,000 jobs that were lost in the early 90's. People are moving from welfare to self-sufficiency in record numbers."
He added, "Impartial observers recognize that there has been a renaissance and revitalization in every borough that is a model for cities around the world."
But Solidelle Wasser, a senior economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said Census Bureau data on poverty rates in the largest metropolitan areas around the country supported the view that New York's economy was lagging behind in lifting the incomes of the poor.
Though small samples make fluctuations from year to year unreliable, she said, it is striking that the 24 percent poverty rate of the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area last year was higher than that in the greater metropolitan regions of Los Angeles (22.5), Chicago (17.3), Detroit (22.4), Washington (23.8) Philadelphia (8), Boston (22.1) and Dallas (17.1). Among those surveyed, only Houston, with a poverty rate of 28.1 percent, was higher.
Ms. Wasser said an analysis of payrolls in New York City between 1992 and 1996 also supports the idea that the recession here disproportionately hurt those at the bottom while the recovery disproportionately benefited those at the top. Though the number of payroll jobs dropped, she found, the amount of money spent on payrolls did not shrink at the same pace, suggesting that low wage jobs were lost while higher-wage job-holders held their own or gained in pay.
David R. Jones, the president and chief executive of the Community Service Society, said the pattern in the census figures raised the question of whether the city's labor market could sustain low wage workers and those leaving welfare.
In December 2001, the five-year lifetime limit on public assistance established by the Federal welfare overhaul will begin to run out for some poor families, he noted, and under state law, those unable to make the transition into work will have to be supported by safety net programs that are financed by state and localities, 50-50.
"That raises some serious concerns for New York City, more perhaps than any other part of the country," Mr. Jones said, "because we're talking about hundreds of thousands rather than handfuls, and because we're already running such high rates of unemployment."
The long-term solution promoted by Ms. Rosen and other economists at the Federal Reserve Bank is not unlike that advanced by the Community Service Society: to provide extra public support for the poor to upgrade their skills, including help with child care, transportation and education.
But the society's analysis of census population surveys, which found the poverty rate among families with children was about 30 percent, also showed a sharp decline in the proportion of such families who received public benefits like Medicaid and food stamps, Mr. Levitan said. The Federal Government considers these benefits important for helping poor parents stay in the work force.
Only 55.9 percent of poor families had been covered by Medicaid even part of the year in 1998, he found, down from 69.9 in 1996, and 57.5 percent had received some food stamps, down from 68.9 two years earlier. The percentage on public assistance declined even further, to 42.3 percent from 58.9 percent.
To the Mayor and his welfare commissioner, Jason A. Turner, however, the decline in public assistance is a big step in the right direction. "New York City has moved from the Welfare Capital of the World to the Work Capital of the World," the Mayor said last week in announcing $31 million in Federal welfare-to-work grants to six community agencies that are to train and place disadvantaged groups like immigrants and former drug addicts.
Larian Angelo, an economist who is deputy director of the City Council's Finance Division, said the disparate impact of the economic boom and the stagnation at the bottom have been reflected in a lack of growth of the middle class.
Two City Council-sponsored studies of 1996 and 1997 census figures found that even as the real estate market rebounded and the securities industry hit record highs, the percentage of the population in the city's middle class barely budged, hovering just over 29 percent. The middle-class category was defined for the study as annual income of between $49,000 and $98,000 for a family of four, based on 1996 dollars.
In comparison, 35 percent of city residents had a middle-class income in 1989, at the end of the previous recovery.

HEADLINE: Harvard's $2.1 Billion Tops Colleges' Big Fund-Raising

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Universities do not usually set fund-raising goals that they cannot meet, but when Harvard decided in 1992 that it would try to raise $2.1 billion by Dec. 31, 1999, the task seemed herculean: the university would have to collect an average of nearly $1 million a day for seven years.
Yesterday, the Harvard president, Neil L. Rudenstine, informed a gathering of alumni at the Harvard Club in Manhattan that the university had not only reached its target, but had exceeded it, raising $2.3 billion, with three months still remaining. 
 Though no American college or university has ever raised as much in a similar period -- Yale and Columbia, believed to be the closest competitors, each raised $1.7 billion over seven years in the 1990's -- Harvard's experience is only the most remarkable example of a larger trend: Donations to institutions of higher education are swelling beyond even the grandest expectations, thanks in large part to a booming economy.
"Donors are much more willing to talk," said Will Melton, the vice president for external affairs at Middlebury College in Vermont, which has raised all but $57 million of the $200 million it hopes to collect from October 1997 to June 2001. "They are not reluctant to talk about their wealth and success, and they want to share it with the institutions that mean something to them."
"This is the golden age of philanthropy," Mr. Melton added, "and Harvard rode the market climb perfectly."
Harvard collected $462.7 million in gifts last year, an increase of 124 percent over the $206.2 million in donations that it recorded in 1992, the end of the most recent recession.
Over the same period, annual contributions rose 152 percent at Princeton; 141 percent at Columbia, and 68 percent at Stanford, according to figures from the Council for Aid to Education, a nonprofit organization that tracks contributions to colleges and universities.
While, in general, the number of donors to each institution did not increase appreciably, the size of donations has grown.
At Harvard, a mere 85 gifts -- out of the 172,000 received since 1992 -- provided nearly half of the campaign goal, university officials said. Each was at least $5 million.
The largest gift, $70.5 million, was pledged in 1995, by John L. Loeb, class of 1924, a former member of Harvard's governing body, and his wife, Frances Lehman Loeb.
Among the most lucrative aspects of the campaign was one that focused on female donors, who have generally given substantially less than male classmates at Harvard.
Rita Hauser -- a member of the law school class of 1959, who, along with her husband, gave $14.5 million to the law school and $10 million to establish the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations -- led an effort that raised $40 million from alumnae.
Harvard intends to use its trove for a variety of purposes.
The school's Widener Library, for example, is to receive a $70 million renovation, and repairs to the freshman dormitories, at about $65 million, have already been completed. And 25 faculty positions have been added to improve the ratio of undergraduate students to professors.
Over the course of the campaign, the university's endowment has grown to $14.2 billion, from $6 billion in 1994. The university's annual budget is $1.8 billion.
At a time when institutions have been under external pressure to spend more of their endowments on their operating expenses, particularly to reduce tuition, Harvard has continued to spend about 5 percent of the value of its endowment annually. But because the size of the endowment has expanded so dramatically, the portion of the operating budget financed by the endowment has grown to 28 percent, from 18 percent about a decade ago.
At Harvard, tuition and other fees, including room and board, are $34,350 this year. Nearly half the students who attend Harvard receive scholarships, with the average grant about $17,200, university officials said.
Asked if Harvard should be willing to part with a bit more of its endowment each year, to lessen the burden on students, Mr. Rudenstine, the president, said, with an eye on the cycles of the world economy over the last century: "You have to make sure that the thing can last forever."
While other institutions contacted yesterday were fairly envious of Harvard's good fortune, Mr. Rudenstine said that in reality, $2.3 billion did not go as far as it used to.
"It's probably going to take $500 million alone just for new space, new equipment, new people, new technicians, new inventions and new teaching, just in the next three to five years," Mr. Rudenstine said. "There is a lot more to do."

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.
 
GARY BARTZ QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Bartz, an alto saxophonist, has kept a strong underground reputation for 30 years, taking a barreling post-bop style into all sorts of areas; on the right night he more than satisfies the thrill seekers who come to hear him. He's playing with the pianist Barney McCall, guitarist Paul Bollenback, bassist James King and drummer Greg Bandy. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $20 cover (for midnight it's $15), and Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with a $15 cover; $10 all nights (Ben Ratliff). 

ANDY BISKIN QUARTET, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9318. Jazz musicians have put their hands to country, blues and gospel, but by and large they haven't done much with Stephen Foster, one of the major early synthesists of American culture. Tonight at 9 and 10:30, a quartet of adventurous young players led by Andy Biskin corrects that imbalance; his arrangements of Foster's music and his own are for clarinet, tuba, trombone, guitar, banjo and drums. Cover charge is $10 (Ratliff).
 
CELEBRACIO COLOMBIANA, Aaron Davis Hall, 135th Street and Convent Avenue, City College, (212) 307-7420. A triple bill of traditionalist bands from Colombia includes two New York City debuts: the singer, drummer and dancer Toto la Momposina with a drum group that plays Colombian and Caribbean rhythms, and the clarinetist Lucho Bermudez with his group. The bill also includes Foncho Castellar, playing rural accordion-driven vallenato music. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $20 and $25 (Jon Pareles).
 
THE CRABS, SARAH DOUGHER, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Olympia, Wash., is no longer trendy, and thank goodness. Now its community of gentle cultural anarchists can get down to making really great homespun rock. Right now, Sarah Dougher is the scene's shiniest gem, a keyboardist with a flair for wringing poignancy from her vintage instruments. She plays with the Crabs, otherwise consisting of a young man and woman grappling with the usual revolutions of daily life. She'll also open with her own songs. Sunday at 9 P.M.; tickets are $6 (Ann Powers).
 
* DUANE EUBANKS QUINTET, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. Mr. Eubanks is a trumpeter and the younger brother of "Tonight Show" guitarist Kevin and trombonist Robin. He plays straight-ahead jazz with the requisite mix of scorch and sensitivity to make it interesting, and this band will show you something interesting again when the horns take a breather: the rhythm section, with the pianist Orrin Evans, bassist Dwayne Burno and drummer Ralph Peterson, can be telepathic as well as flame-throwing. Sets are tonight at 9, 10:30 and midnight, and the cover charge is $15 (Ratliff).
 
* LOS FABULOSOS CADILLACS, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Penn Station, (212) 564-4882. A band from cosmopolitan Buenos Aires, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs will toss in anything -- ska, samba, lounge, punk, funk, tango, cool jazz, merengue -- in pursuit of the dizzy paradoxes of modernity. They are among Latin America's heirs to Brazilian tropicalia, fearlessly allowing themselves to be heartfelt or ironic as they explore the pan-American cornucopia. King Chango and Sweet 75 (with Krist Novoselic of Nirvana) share the bill. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 (Pareles).
 
VICENTE FERNANDEZ and ROCIO DURCAL, Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 32d Street (212) 465-6741. In Mexico, Vicente Fernandez is a household name, a television star who owes his fame to songs about loving, crying and suffering. With his dramatic tenor voice and his wall-shaking vibrato, Mr. Fernandez brings out all the melodrama of Mexican ranchera songs that bounce and laugh as they detail vast heartaches. Rocio Durcal, another leading Mexican pop singer, has plenty of drama of her own. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $40 to $75 (Pareles).
 
* GEORGE GARZONE'S THE FRINGE, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A teaching guru who's spent much of his career in Boston, the tenor saxophonist has played much more in New York in the last few years. He's well drilled in free play (this particular band's strength) as well as the post-Coltrane mainstream, and he can be a fearsome performer, shifting around harmonies with a casual finesse. Music is tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday night at 8 and 9:30; admission is $10 per set with a one drink minimum (Ratliff).
 
* KIP HANRAHAN'S DEEP RUMBA, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Kip Hanrahan, a producer who knows and loves New York's constantly cross-breeding rhythms, assembled Deep Rumba for an album released last year. The 12-member supergroup is steeped in Afro-Cuban rhythms both sacred and secular; it features Milton Cardona on congas and Horacio (El Negro) Hernandez and Robby Ameen on trap drums, along with Andy Gonzalez on bass and Charles Neville (of the Neville Brothers) on saxophone. They use the ancient rhythms in volatile new combinations. Tomorrow at 9 and 11 P.M. and Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M.; admission is $15 (Pareles).
 
HAUNTED HOUSE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. It's the new band led by the guitarist Loren Mazzacane Connors, whose style is so inward that he demands the full concentration of the musicians around him. The drummer William Hooker, who joins the band as a guest tonight, may flatten Mr. Connors, or at least test his resources. The show is tomorrow at 8 P.M., and admission is $8. Stay, if you can, for sets later that evening by the bassist Melvin Gibbs and the band Slow Poke (Ratliff).
 
MARK HELIAS'S OPEN/LOOSE, Internet Cafe, 82 East Third Street, East Village, (212) 614-0747. One of the best bassists working in New York, Mr. Helias has played in some pretty, uh, open and loose bands over the years, but his presence on the stand is a guarantee that the music will come alive: he can't help but make a band bounce. He's worked with the tenor saxophonist Ellery Eskelin and drummer Tom Rainey in plenty of situations over the last 10 years; their trio explores written work as well as music where the floor drops out entirely. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 9:30 and 11; admission is $7 (Ratliff).
 
* JOE HENRY, JULIANA HATFIELD, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Over eight albums, Joe Henry has grown better and better at connecting the wild metaphors of his lyrics with music that's appropriately itchy, sexy and weird. "Fuse," the masterpiece he made this year, is as soulful and individualistic as the singer-songwriter genre gets. Juliana Hatfield, guitarist and singer preoccupied with hitting a pre-verbal nerve within the song form, opens for Mr. Henry with a solo set. Tonight at 10; tickets are $12 (Powers).
 
ISRAEL VIBRATION, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square (212) 777-6800. Israel Vibration's members met as children at a polio rehabilitation center; now they harmonize in devout, steadfast, "conscious reggae" songs about suffering and the faith to carry them through. Tonight doors open at 10. at Irving Plaza; tickets are $25 (Pareles).
 
AHMAD JAMAL TRIO, Iridium, 48 West 63d Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Mr. Jamal can be great playing live: he structures his music around long vamps, and gives himself lots of room to shift the tunes around on the spot, with a signal to his musicians. He's been influential from the start, in the 1950's, and he continues to sound like a master with something to teach us. Sets through Sunday night are at 8:30 and 10:30, and admission is $30 cover and $10 minimum (Ratliff).
 
OLIVER LAKE STEEL QUARTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 242-1785. This alto saxophonist's sense of structured play has led him toward reggae, big-band concepts, Eric Dolphy homages and a lot of other things, but this band is a newer group, developed over the last few years, featuring the steel drum player Lyndon Achee. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; admission is $20, with a $10 minimum tonight and tomorrow night; Sunday it is $17.50 and $10 minimum (Ratliff).
 
RUSSELL MALONE QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Malone is literate in the jazz guitar tradition from Django Reinhardt to Wes Montgomery and beyond, and he likes to play all sorts of snippets showing his breadth; his fluidity can be jaw-dropping. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 A.M. set tonight and tomorrow; admission is $20 and $15 on Sunday (Ratliff).
 
MARIAN McPARTLAND TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 581-3080. She's still playing well, with brightness and vigor and the hard-edged feel of New York jazz in the 1950's; people tend to forget about this in light of her identity as a genial radio host and public personality. This gig is special in that she's reuniting with the bassist Bill Crow and the drummer Joe Morello, the original trio from her almost decadelong engagement at the Hickory House, which began in 1952. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11 P.M.; cover charge is $25 at a table and $10 minimum and $20 at the bar, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).
 
* MEHR AND SHER ALI, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Times Square, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. There are various schools of qawwali, the devotional Sufi music that uses steady handclaps, simple melodies and flamboyant, accelerating improvisations to lift its devotees to ecstasy. Mehr and Sher Ali, two singing brothers, are part of the rough-and-ready Punjabi school, the same style as the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and they spur each other to peak after peak. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $25, $35 and $45 (Pareles).
 
NETAID, Giants Stadium, Route 3, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900. The latest attempt to forge a United Nations of concerned pop stars has the real United Nations backing it. Netaid, which plans to use the Internet as "a medium of social and economic change," was created in conjunction with the United Nations Development Program and has attracted the interest of pop luminaries including Bono and Wyclef Jean, who will perform together Saturday. Simultaneous shows will take place in London and Geneva; the New Jersey event also features the Black Crowes, the Counting Crows, Sheryl Crow (perhaps the first such incidence of synchronicity), Jewel, Jimmy Page, Mary J. Blige, Puff Daddy, Sting, Busta Rhymes, the Algerian singer Cheb Mami and the Italian heartthrob Zucchero. It's got to be chaos. But it's for a good cause: this time, the money goes to benefit Kosovan and Sudanese refugees. Tomorrow at 5 P.M.; tickets are $75 (Powers).
 
* ERIC REED, Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse, Rose Building, 165 West 65th Street, 10th Floor, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. Mr. Reed, who was Wynton Marsalis's pianist for six years and held the piano chair in the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra until recently, is a playful musician with a fearsome sense of direction and a need to make performances be enjoyed. He has compositional resources, too, and more and more of an arranger's sensibility. He tore it up six weeks ago at the Village Vanguard with a septet, but even in solo performances, which form tonight's program, he'll set up surprises for the audience. Tonight at 8; tickets are $40 (Ratliff).
 
MARC RIBOT/JAMAALADEEN TACUMA/JOHN ZORN, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Expect the unexpected from these three veterans of downtown music, on guitar, bass and saxophone; they might slay you with music that's free or funky or funny or nasty. Music is tonight at 9 and 11; admission is $14 and $12 in advance (Ratliff).
 
THE SAMPLES, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-1224. Boulder, Colo., is the home of this jam band, which has mustered quite an avid fan base after 12 years of touring. The Samples' sound is clean, like the air in those Rocky Mountains: a little bit folk, a little bit jazz, a lot of laid-back good vibes. With Chris DiCroce. Tomorrow at 9 P.M; tickets are $16.50 in advance, $18 day of show (Powers).
 
ZZ TOP, LYNYRD SKYNYRD, SCREAMIN' CHEETAH WHEELIES, Continental Airlines Arena, Route 3, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900. Eh-heh-heh-heh-heh. The patented growl of Billy Gibbons echoes loudly in the archives of classic rock, where ZZ Top, the Texas trio with the funky facial hair, represents down-home authenticity as well as anyone. Lynyrd Skynyrd gained its historical standard through tragedy, in the famous plane crash that killed the singer Ronnie Van Zandt and several colleagues, but the band (now featuring Mr. Van Zandt's son on vocals) deserves praise more for its noble Southern rock than its penchant for disaster. Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies keeps that history moving forward, jam--band style. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $39.50 and $29.50 (Powers).

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Time Jumps the Track

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
The Museum of Modern Art has cut the ribbon on its contribution to the millennium furor: a 17-month series of exhibitions under the umbrella title "MOMA 2000." In addition to being a summing up of this venerable institution's past, it is (or so we are told) a rehearsal for its future.
The completed project will mix hundreds of objects from the permanent collection -- some of them chestnuts (Rodin's "Balzac," Picasso's "Three Musicians," Gaugin's "Moon and the Earth (Hina Tefatou)," others unfamiliar -- into three successive chronological chunks. Those chunks will be subdivided into thematic units titled "People," "Places" and "Things," each of which will fill a floor of the museum for a few months. 
 That's the big picture; the final results are still in the stars. But from the first increment, which is called "Modern Starts: People" and focuses on the human figure in art from 1880 to 1920, one can glean some hint of what to expect from the whole.
The main idea is to cast an impressionistic glance backward at modern art as a phenomenon, and at the museum that has done much to create and promote that phenomenon, or at least a somewhat Olympian version of it. But the real news may lie in what the show says about the shape of things to come.
In 2001 the Modern is scheduled to break ground on a building that will house, among other things, permanent-collection galleries. Such galleries are a museum's core identity, its official statement about how it sees art: what it deems important, what goes with what. Any tinkering with this statement, never mind a complete overhaul, demands hard, subtle, consensual thought.
This is especially true after critical theory in the last few decades has thrown the very terms "museum," "modern" and "art" into question. By now, it seems, everyone knows that art institutions are impure, driven by social and economic agendas. Every collection and installation is an interpretation. And any historical account based on a linear progression of one era's notion of main events is, at best, provisional.
The Modern, for its part, has long been in the canon-making business. Its curatorial house style might be summed up in the phrase "neatness counts." Its view of 20th-century art as a carefully calibrated flow chart of successive avant-garde movements has, until recently, been unswerving, some would say doctrinaire.
On the evidence of "Modern Starts" -- which has been organized by the curatorial team of John Elderfield, Peter Reed, Maria del Carmen Gonzalez, Mary Chan and Elizabeth Levine -- efforts are being made, however cautiously, to give such certainties a shake.
Right off the escalator to the second floor it is clear that something is up. A mural-like drawing by Sol LeWitt suggests that the show's historic time frame isn't hard and fast. Inside the galleries the pristine white walls that have always framed the permanent collection are painted in greens, browns and grays.
And then there's the art. The opening image -- a life-size undated painting by Leon Bakst of the dancer Nijinsky as a strapping young man in scarlet trunks, one hand raised in salute -- is bound to be a novelty even to die-hard Modern denizens. The portrait has been in the collection for years, but the Modern has never shown it.
You can see why. A cross between a 19th-century academic study and a Hollywood hunk, a little heroic and a little absurd, this figure is too far outside the mainstream to fit any esthetic pigeonhole. But the work is an ideal lead-in for a show that has declared its intention to bring together diverse and unexpected art.
Eclecticism of style, date and medium pervades the first galleries of "Modern Starts," devoted to the theme "Actors, Dancers, Bathers." Picasso's 1915 "Harlequin" hangs beside a "Hamlet" poster produced around 1884 by the British designers who called themselves the Beggarstaffs (real names: William Nicholson and James Pryde). Cezanne's seminude male "Bather" (circa 1885) is accompanied by a 1993 photograph by the Dutch artist Rineke Dijkstra of a boy in a swimsuit on a beach.
The pairing is a neat demonstration of how a single classic pictorial motif can recur, which is nice to see, in a textbooky way. The pictures are far more interesting, though, as studies in the eroticized male body, a subject that might easily have been pushed a lot further but, in a show that in general treads timidly over potentially risky ground, it is not.
Eroticism is explored more forcefully in images of the reclining female nude in an adjoining gallery. These range from Erich Heckel's woodcut portrait of his feral-looking 12-year-old model Franzi, to Paul Klee's grotesque "Virgin in the Tree," to a magnetic Titianesque Modigliani nude stretched across a red ground that looks like swiped-on blood.
The overall effect is striking and theatrical. The gallery, with its gray-brown walls, has a penumbral, sickroom feel. A sense of the neurasthenic mystery of early modernism -- feverish and creepy -- comes through. And one realizes afresh how much this art is a product of male-generated sexual fantasy.
Fantastic or otherwise, the modern body is an organism under transformation, and this is the main theme of the rest of the show. Change can occur through metamorphosis, as in Matisse's series of five bronze heads of a young woman named Jeanette: in the first, she looks more or less like you and me; in the last, done six years later, she is a conflation of abstract swells and bumps, like a pileup of breakfast rolls.
Sometimes figures dissolve like ectoplasm into their environment: Vuillard depicts his sister being sucked into the wallpaper behind her. Most often, though, the figure is fragmented: shattered into bits, truncated, scrambled.
The result can look comedic in a proto-Junk Art sculpture by Vladimir Baranoff-Rossine. It turns slightly brutish in Francis Picabia's little painting, "Conversation II," with its limbless torsos lying about like chops on a grill. The effect is somewhere in between these two poles in a 1990 video by Gary Hill in which a male body is carved up among several screens, tummy here, nose there.
The title of the final section, "Composing With the Figure," implies that what comes apart can be reassembled, although radically changed. Entered in evidence are three big paintings: Picabia's wild-and-crazy "I See Again in My Memory My Dear Udnie" (1914), all nozzles and fleshy polyps; Leger's "Three Women" (1921), with their sheet-metal hair and stainless-steel limbs, and Picasso's "Desmoiselles d'Avignon," which is, in essence, the restitched and revivified post-mortem corpse of the premodern human form.
By the time we arrive at this monument, displayed like an altarpiece, where have we been? Through a series of stylishly installed, atmospheric installations. And through a number of perceptive thematic groupings, some of which set up extended rhythms that run through the show. (Remember the raised hand of the Bakst Nijinsky? It is there again in "Desmoiselles.")
But has the standard view of modernism, the one delivered for generations from on high in authoritative MOMA-ese, been revised? Not really. To be sure, the museum has made a point of saying that "MOMA 2000," in sum and in parts, is not intended as a grand, definitive statement. So if this first installment looks more like a cosmetic make over than a structural shift, we have been warned.
Yet one can still not help asking for something different, and more. Bland, old-fashioned formalist and iconographic themes still prevail. And the mix of artists is not all that much of a mix. Mostly it is major work by famous artists and minor works by famous artists, often the same artists.
To some degree this is dictated by the shape of the Modern's holdings. But surely the museum has oddball material tucked away, stuff that must have seemed decent enough when it was acquired but later got the "reject" stamp and might not look half-bad now. The cornucopian "Art of the 40's" exhibition in 1991 suggested as much. It would be good if a few more early-modern unknowns and irregulars had been brought out to join the fray, or to create a fray, which is exactly what's missing.
But there are very promising things, too. One, predictably, comes in a section devoted to photography. Here voices otherwise absent are heard, including those of women, from Frances Benjamin Johnston to Tina Barney, and non-Europeans like Martin Chambi of Peru and Seydou Keita of Mali. One assumes many more such inclusions are planned for coming installations, which will carry the modernist saga beyond 1920 and into the present.
And at least one section, a compact minishow of work by James Ensor (1860-1949) and Jose Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913), points to depths in the museum's holdings that could, if explored, significantly broaden the historical picture while remaining within the parameters of the collection.
These two artists lived on opposite sides of the world, Ensor in Belgium, Posada in Mexico. They probably never saw each other's work, although their moralizing, politically pointed, death-riddled humor is close in form and spirit. Shown together, they evoke a kind of transcultural Day of the Dead, and they have much to say about institutionally redefining early modernism as an international phenomenon, with popular roots and diverse audiences.
Ensor was connected with the European Symbolist avant-garde; Posada emerged from a regional art tradition. While Ensor worked in relative isolation and in small print editions, Posada produced more than 20,000 engravings in a broadsheet medium that appealed to a mass audience, rich and poor. The influences of both artists can, to varying degrees, be found in Latin American art to this day. And their pairing here proposes a widening view of modernism, past and present, only sporadically suggested in the surrounding galleries.
The Modern has suggested that the new permanent-collection galleries, which are several years down the line, will incorporate pocket-size installations like this one; and that's a promise we should hold it to. As the museum expands, it only makes sense that its view of art should expand, too.
"Modern Starts: People" tiptoes in this direction and gets by more on new style than on new substance. But as the larger canvas of "MOMA 2000" unfolds, this first step could turn out to be the start of something new.
"Modern Starts: People" remains at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9480, through Feb. 1. "Modern Starts: Places" opens on Oct. 28; "Modern Starts: Things" on Nov. 21.

HEADLINE: Trade and Pestilence

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The West Nile-like virus that has killed several New Yorkers and the Asian long-horned beetles recently found near Central Park are symptomatic of the growing number of foreign pathogens entering the country with imported products. As an Oct. 4 front-page article ("Mosquito Virus Exposes Hole in Safety Net") notes, United States health officials are fighting back. But they have one hand tied behind their backs. 
 The problem is that the same rules made by the World Trade Organization to promote international trade also prevent regulators from taking the precautionary steps necessary to keep pest invaders out. We shouldn't have to choose between free trade and a safe environment.
President Clinton needs to show leadership in fixing W.T.O. rules that prevent regulators from stopping invasive pests and diseases at our borders, especially when cleanup requires spraying communities with pesticides or chopping down trees.

HEADLINE: Biotech Can Prosper

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Biotech Companies Feel Overlooked by New York" (news article, Oct. 6): Biotechnology can thrive in New York City if we learn how to use the region's science and technology assets to spark economic growth. Universities must understand how to manage their intellectual property, establish partnerships with industry and remain flexible enough to accommodate faculty who wish to be entrepreneurs. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University have done this and have spawned innovative companies. New York campuses can do similarly. 
 The New York area needs a thriving economy. If we work together to exploit all of the region's assets, we can be globally competitive in technology within a decade.

HEADLINE: E. C. Banfield, 83, Maverick On Urban Policy Issues, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Edward C. Banfield, a professor emeritus of government at Harvard University whose work on urban policy and the causes of poverty gave him a reputation as a brilliant maverick, died Sept. 30 at his summer home in Vermont. He was 83 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
Mr. Banfield, born on a farm in Bloomfield, Conn., held Harvard's Henry Lee Shattuck Chair in Government for many years. He was one of the intellectual leaders of the Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology Joint Center for Urban Studies in the 1960's and 70's, when the problems of cities were prominent on the national political agenda. 
 His books and articles had a sharp contrarian edge. He was a critic of almost every mainstream liberal idea in domestic policy, especially the use of Federal aid to help relieve urban poverty. Mr. Banfield argued that at best Government programs would fail because they aimed at the wrong problems; at worst they would make the problems worse. He fostered generations of graduate students, some of whom became leading figures in American intellectual life. They included James Q. Wilson, who succeeded him in his chair at Harvard, and Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
Mr. Banfield received his B.A. in English from the University of Connecticut in 1938 and went to work for the United States Forest Service. After jobs with the New Hampshire Farm Bureau and the United States Farm Security Administration in Washington and California, he went to the University of Chicago to work on his doctorate in political science. Chicago at that time, under the influence of figures like Milton Friedman and Leo Strauss, was a bastion of laissez-faire politics, a cause that Mr. Banfield later promoted in his own work.
He served briefly on the faculty in Chicago, moving to Harvard in 1959. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania before returning to Harvard at the end of his career.
In 1955 Mr. Banfield and Mr. Meyerson collaborated on "Politics, Planning and the Public Interest," which examined Chicago's public housing projects. That book was one of several in which Mr. Banfield found Government programs to be foiled by a law of unintended consequences. In the Chicago case, he predicted that creating tall institutional buildings full of small apartments would have the unintended effect of racially isolating the urban poor.
A major theme of Mr. Banfield's work on poverty, which was often angrily criticized in liberal circles, is that culture plays a more important role than factors like discrimination or lack of education in impeding a person's economic progress.
Among his most influential books was "The Moral Basis of a Backward Society," a study of a small village in southern Italy, researched in collaboration with his wife, the former Laura Fasano. Mr. Banfield's thesis, summed up in a term he coined, "amoral familism," was that the narrow focus on family relations prevented people from cooperating with those outside the family or village.
He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Laura Banfield Hoguet, a lawyer; a son, Elliott A. Banfield, an illustrator, and four grandchildren.
Mr. Banfield's emphasis on culture as the basic element in poverty drew accusations that he was promoting a "blame the victim" attitude. In his 1970 book "The Unheavenly City," and in various papers that he published in the late 60's, he recognized the existence and harm of racism but propounded the view that economic class and not race was the essential ingredient in poverty.
In that book Mr. Banfield constructed a sociological portrait of what he called "the lower-class individual" as someone who was very different from the middle-class professionals who sought ways to solve his problems. "The lower-class individual lives moment to moment," he wrote. "Impulse governs his behavior either because he cannot discipline himself to sacrifice a present for a future satisfaction or because he has no sense of the future. He is therefore radically improvident."
Mr. Banfield's role as an adviser to President Richard M. Nixon and chairman of his Model Cities Task Force gave his published views an extra measure of controversy. During the Reagan Administration he served on a task force seeking ways to increase public support for the arts. But his subsequent book, "The Democratic Muse: Visual Arts and the Public Interest," argued that Federal support of the arts was neither justified by the Constitution nor useful in practice.
"Affording enjoyment to people is not a proper function of organizations serving the common good," he wrote in that book.

HEADLINE: Borrowing By Consumers Up in August

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing grew in August by the largest amount in seven months as spending by Americans showed little sign of abating, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
Borrowing rose by $10.8 billion in August to a total of $1.37 trillion. The increase was bigger than the $6.6 billion expected by analysts and follows a gain of $8.9 billion in July. The Fed originally reported July borrowing had risen $8.8 billion. 
 The increase means consumer debt has been growing at an annual rate of 9.6 percent as of August, compared with 7.9 percent in July and 5.4 percent in 1998.
"If this continues to mount at this pace, we could have troubles because consumers are going to have to catch up and pay up their debt," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York. "So it could lead to slower spending ahead."
The rise is the biggest since one of $15.3 billion in January. The August rise coincided with a jump of nine-tenths of a percent in consumer spending, the largest since February.
By category, auto and other loans rose $6.5 billion in August after climbing $3 billion in July. Auto sales rose 9.5 percent in September, as the annual industry selling rate surged to a record pace for the eighth consecutive month. The auto industry reported its best month since 1986 in August.
Credit card and other revolving debt increased $4.3 billion in August after rising $5.9 billion during July.
In another report, the Labor Department said first-time jobless claims increased 10,000, to a seasonally adjusted 312,000 for the week ended Saturday. Claims in the week ended Sept. 25 were revised to 302,000, the first time in 10 weeks that claims surpassed 300,000. Analysts said the increases most likely reflected the floods and other effects of Hurricane Floyd, which struck North Carolina Sept. 16.
"It is likely this is just a fluke because of the bad weather on the East Coast, and the labor market remains tight," said Scott Brown of Raymond James & Associates.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Fed Reconsiders Policy Of Disclosing Tilt on Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Concerned that its latest attempt to be more open might be confusing investors as much as helping them, the Federal Reserve is reviewing its new practice of disclosing once-secret decisions about tilting policy toward raising or reducing interest rates, the central bank said today.
The Fed said it had established a committee to study ways to clarify the meaning of the statement the central bank issues at the conclusion of each policy meeting. Since May, the Fed has used the statement not only to disclose any immediate changes to monetary policy, but also to say whether it had adopted a "bias," a formal decision that it sees a possible need to raise or lower rates in the near future. 
 But it has never been clear -- to investors who bet fortunes based on their reading of likely interest rate moves, or to Fed officials themselves -- whether the adoption of a bias is a clear expression of the central bank's intent to shift policy within a month or two or a much vaguer warning.
The establishment of the committee was disclosed in the minutes of the Aug. 24 Fed meeting, where the central bank pushed its benchmark Federal funds target rate up by a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, as a protective move against a possible resurgence of inflation pressures. The minutes showed that the rate hike was approved by a vote of 9-1.
The lone dissenter was Robert D. McTeer Jr., president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who has become a leading advocate of the theory that the economy is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth, in part because of huge investments by business in efficiency-enhancing technology.
Mr. McTeer had also dissented from the Fed's previous quarter- point rate increase, in June. The minutes of the August meeting stated that Mr. McTeer believed "that positive supply-side forces will continue to damp the impact of strong demand on output prices and that productivity gains will continue to damp the effect of higher wages on unit labor costs."
The minutes said the review of how the Fed discloses its policy bias would be led by Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the central bank's vice chairman.
In May, the Fed said it had adopted a bias toward tightening, a step it followed with an interest rate increase in June. At the June 30 meeting, it moved to a neutral bias, which many investors took to mean that the Fed had no intention of raising rates at its next meeting, in August.
But in August, the Fed tightened again, and again said it had a neutral bias. At its latest meeting, on Tuesday, the Fed held rates steady, and moved to a tightening bias, although it added that the adoption of the bias should not be seen as a "commitment to near-term action."
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, noted at the August meeting that "the sentence relating to the directive was subject to differing interpretations," and that the decision to make immediate announcements about "significant changes in the symmetry or asymmetry in the directive had made it desirable to clarify its meaning."
It is unclear what steps the committee may recommend to clear up the confusion, although the minutes said the Fed was not contemplating dropping the new practice altogether. The committee is expected to report back by spring. In addition to Mr. Ferguson, it is made up of all the Federal Reserve governors except Mr. Greenspan, plus the presidents of three Reserve banks.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Jumped 5.5% In September

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Retail sales at stores open for more than a year rose 5.5 percent in September as shoppers bought fall fashions and back-to-school supplies.
Styles like fleece vests and women's fashions with stretch fabrics and brighter colors spurred sales, analysts said. Sales of cargo pants, corduroy slacks and utility packs increased as students headed back to school. 
 The statistics, calculated in the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index, said sales at the nation's two largest clothing chains -- Limited Inc. and Gap Inc. -- rose 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
"There's a newness on the fashion front that we haven't seen in a while," said Maura Hunter Byrne, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst.
Sales rose 4.1 percent at Sears, Roebuck & Company, the biggest increase since May 1998 for the largest department-store company and more than double some analysts' expectations. Its sales were led by demand for clothing and appliances.
Sales were also helped by rising consumer confidence and low unemployment. An index produced by the University of Michigan showed that consumers in September grew more optimistic about their finances and economic prospects. Analysts expect the Labor Department to report today that the nation's unemployment rate stayed at a 29-year low in September.
September's results and economy point to strong sales for the Christmas season, though there are some worries that rising oil prices and other indications of inflation may cut into spending, analysts said.
"I think we're going to continue to see the momentum we're seeing year-to-date," said Asma Usmani, a retail analyst at Edward Jones & Company. "Consumer spending still continues to increase at a 6 to 7 percent annualized basis."
Clothing chains reported among the highest sales gains in September as the new fashions and cooler weather sent shoppers into stores looking for sweaters and autumn clothing.
Intimate Brands Inc., which owns the Victoria's Secret lingerie and Bath & Body Works chains, yesterday reported a 13 percent gain, topping forecasts.
The 7 percent sales increase at Gap, which has heavily advertised its new vests, beat analyst estimates of 3 percent to 6 percent. Gap is the parent of both Old Navy and Banana Republic.
The Kohl's Corporation, which sells clothes, said sales rose 6.9 percent. TJX Companies, the largest off-price clothing retailer with chains such as T.J. Maxx, said sales rose 7 percent.
"Sales trends this fall continue to be robust, said its chairman, Bernard Cammarata.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said that sales rose 7.2 percent in September.
The Kmart Corporation's 2.5 percent rise was in line with analysts' estimates. The company, though, said the increase was less than it forecast because of promotions by other retailers during the back-to-school selling period.
The Dayton Hudson Corporation's Target stores had an 8.6 percent increase, above analyst's top estimates.
Department stores continued to lag other retailers in sales growth, in part because of Hurricane Floyd, analysts said.
Federated Department Stores said sales rose 3.7 percent. The increase was smaller than expected, as Hurricane Floyd kept customers away from its stores. Analysts had projected sales to rise 4 percent to 5 percent.
Saks Inc., operator of the Saks Fifth Avenue and other department stores, said sales rose 5 percent on increased purchases of designer clothes, men's sportswear and shoes. Sales increased 6 percent if effects from the hurricane were excluded.
Sales at the J. C. Penney Company, fell one-tenth of a percent.

Gauges MostlyLose Ground As Report on Jobs Is Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks closed mostly lower yesterday as investors took profits from the hefty jump in prices on Wednesday and looked nervously ahead to the Government's employment report that is due this morning.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 51.29 points, to 10,537.05. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 7.76 points, to 1,317.64, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 3.49 points, to 2,860.70. 
 "Taking profits is part of the story today after a big run-up on Wednesday, and the other part is waiting for tomorrow to see what September's employment numbers look like," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
The Dow climbed 187.75 points, to 10,588.34, on Wednesday as investors temporarily set aside worries about rising interest rates and focused on corporate earnings. But with the market's volatility in the last month amid nervousness over interest rates, many investors decided to take a prudent approach yesterday and collect profits before the employment report from the Labor Department.
The market will be scrutinizing the report to see if there are signs of inflation that could prompt the Federal Reserve to push rates higher at its next policy meeting, in November.
But even if the figures on jobs and wages contained in the report signal that inflation is indeed under control, analysts expect a continuation of the price swings that Wall Street has been experiencing over the last several weeks. The Dow fell more than 1,100 points from a record closing high of 11,326.04 on Aug. 25 before recovering ground in recent sessions.
Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Securities, said third-quarter earnings reports, which traders have been optimistically awaiting, would help some stock sectors but not the overall market.
"In terms of the averages, you're not going to get a clear-cut bull market going," he said.
Although the technology-dominated Nasdaq index gave up early gains, some high-profile Internet stocks were higher, most notably Yahoo, the Internet search company, which soared 14 1/2, to 190 1/4, after it reported quarterly earnings results late Wednesday that were stronger than analysts had expected.
"I think Internet stocks have turned a corner," Mr. Johnson said. "But I've said that before."
Financial stocks, reflecting more nerves about interest rates, were mostly lower, including Chase Manhattan, which was down 1 3/8, to 74 9/16, and Bank of America, down 2 3/16 at 56 11/16.
American Home Products, the drug maker, rose 3 9/16, to 48 11/16, after it agreed to a $3.75 billion settlement over its once-popular diet pill combination, fen-phen.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
European Central Bank Leaves Interest Rate Unchanged

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The European Central Bank decided not to stop Europe's party today, but it bluntly warned that it would probably move soon to slow things down.
Despite steadily increasing concern about inflationary pressures in Europe, the central bank chose to leave its core interest rate unchanged at 2.5 percent. 
 But the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, issued his clearest and most emphatic statement that the 11-nation euro zone needed to be cooled down and that a tighter monetary policy was almost inevitable.
"We have now had a truly accommodative monetary policy for more than a year," Mr. Duisenberg said after a meeting of the bank's board here today. He said the bank was now looking ahead to "a monetary strategy that is conducive to sustainable, noninflationary growth. That is something different."
Investors, who had thought the bank might raise interest rates today, initially reacted by pushing down the value of the euro, Europe's new common currency.
But they reversed course after absorbing Mr. Duisenberg's unambiguously hawkish remarks, which apparently convinced investors that a tougher policy would come sooner rather than later.
The euro ended the day up against the dollar, settling in New York at $1.07100 compared with $1.06970 Wednesday. Major European stock markets also ended higher, as investors apparently chose to focus more on Europe's vibrant economy rather than the prospect of higher rates. London's blue-chip index rose 1.69 percent, while Frankfurt's main index rose 1.23 percent and France's rose 1.08 percent.
The European Central Bank's decision paralleled a similar verdict today at the Bank of England, which left British rates unchanged at 5.25 percent.
It also meshed with the stance adopted by the United States Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
European bankers have been looking for guidance amid a welter of sometimes conflicting data. The bank sharply cut its core rate in April to 2.5 percent from 3 percent, because the European economy had stalled and seemed dangerously close to a recession.
But the outlook has brightened measurably in the last several months, partly because Asian countries are recovering from the financial crisis that first gripped that region two years ago.
Most forecasters expect the European Union economy to grow about 2.1 percent this year and nearly 3 percent next year. Exports and industrial production are picking up in many countries, and joblessness has moved downward from more than 10 percent to about 9.4 percent.
But bankers also see a growing body of warning signs. Businesses and consumers are borrowing money at a much more rapid rate, with private-sector credit expanding 10.7 percent in August. The money supply, which is considered a barometer of inflationary pressure, has climbed somewhat faster than the central bank would like. And consumer prices have been nudged upward by big increases in oil prices.
Mr. Duisenberg now seems convinced that the main threat is inflation and, by extension, the credibility of the euro in world markets. Higher rates would tend to strengthen the European currency.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Brooklyn Co-op Makes A Financial Comeback

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A four-building, 64-apartment co-op in the Kensington section of Brooklyn that avoided foreclosure seven months ago is back on stable financial footing, ending nearly five years of struggle and enabling shareholders to sell their apartments.
Under a reorganization plan approved by the Federal Bankruptcy Court last month, the co-op refinanced its underlying mortgage with MEW Equities of Brooklyn, one of several companies that specialize in refinancing troubled buildings. 
 As part of its return to financial stability, the co-op, known as the Parkway and C Owners Corporation, placed a special assessment averaging $8,700 per apartment on shareholders. The funds are being used to replenish the co-op's reserve fund and to make improvements in its brick buildings, which fill an entire blockfront along Avenue C between East Fourth and East Fifth Streets, one block from Ocean Parkway.
MEW has taken over 10 apartments from shareholders who either walked away from their investment or could not pay the assessment. As part of the reorganization, MEW is required to rent those apartments and switch to selling them in three years to avoid competing with shareholders selling their apartments.
"The goal was to save as many shareholders as possible, helping those who want to, to sell and get out, and those who don't, to remain financially whole," said John D. Cella, a former president of the co-op board.
In co-ops, shareholders must make monthly payments for their part of their building's underlying mortgage and the operating charges allocated to their apartments. The shareholders also typically make monthly payments on the loans that they have taken out to buy their apartments. If the building is foreclosed, the co-op owners can lose their investment while remaining liable for the loans, said Steven A. Kirschenbaum, a partner with the Manhattan law firm of Hartman & Carven who represents the owners of the Brooklyn co-op.
Mr. Cella and his wife, Lisa, who have owned their apartment since the buildings were converted in 1987, are among the first shareholders selling their apartments. Last year, the couple, seeing the prospect of the co-op's recovery, bought a home in Suffern, N.Y., and rented out their two-bedroom Brooklyn unit, which they are now negotiating to sell to their current tenant. "I'm not a landlord and it's time to move on," Mr. Cella said.
Like many other cooperatives, the Brooklyn complex was faced with financial woes that arose when the economic boom of the mid-1980's deflated. The problems included defaults on loans by sponsors, high mortgages granted to sponsors by lenders, nonpayment of monthly maintenance charges by shareholders and foreclosure by banks.
While some buildings still suffer from long-term problems, most have turned around. The co-op on Avenue C in Brooklyn is an example of what could go wrong.
The buildings were run down and empty before 1987, when the original sponsor converted them to a co-op. Over the next year, all but two of the one- to three-bedroom apartments, with 675 to 1,000 square feet on average, were sold for $52,000 to $107,000. But when the real estate market faltered in 1989, so did the complex.
The original lender, American Savings Bank, failed, and the mortgage was sold to an investor pool managed by State Street Bank and Trust of Boston. Through 1991, many original owners moved away and rented out their units because they were unable to sell them, mainly because of the complex's large underlying mortgage, and, in turn, high monthly maintenance charges. The maintenance fees averaged $592 a month, which was about one-third higher than the standard for co-ops in the area.
Mr. Kirschenbaum said the rents did not cover both the monthly maintenance and the owners' individual loan payments, so by 1994, the co-op defaulted on its mortgage.
To grab the lender's attention, Mr. Kirschenbaum advised the co-op in late 1994 to stop paying the mortgage and to reduce its monthly maintenance to an average of $196, from $592, enough to cover operating costs. At that point, with the rents exceeding the monthly maintenance costs, the shareholders put the difference into a fund for future use.
Early in 1995, the lender filed to foreclose on the complex. It took four more years to persuade the lender to sell the loan and find a company to buy it and work out a deal that "would give shareholders back control of the co-op," Mr. Kirschenbaum said. Last February, the co-op also filed for bankruptcy protection to stay the foreclosure.
Under the reorganization plan, MEW Equities bought the underlying mortgage, which had ballooned from $2.8 million, to $4.25 million, because of unpaid interest, and revised it last month to its current $2.5 million. The monthly maintenance charge was also restored to its higher level, with the lower underlying mortgage making it in line with today's market, and the special assessment was collected from all but four unit owners.
In exchange for the refinancing, MEW took over six units abandoned early on by shareholders and bought the four whose owners did not pay the special assessment. In April, MEW's management arm started to manage the building.
The 10 apartments "provide a meaningful upside," given the strong rental market, said Martin Wydra, a principal of MEW as well as of Park Sterling Brokerage Ltd. of Brooklyn. He added that the units would be renovated when leases expired and monthly rents, now at $825 to $1,300, would be raised to $925 to $1,600.
Mr. Cella, who said he hoped to sell his apartment in the next four months, said his $61,000 asking price was lower than the $70,000 he paid for the unit. "I'm still out my original deposit, but I'll make out fine," he said. Over time, Mr. Cella said, values will rise and "other people at the complex will get back more of their investment than I'm getting back."

HEADLINE: Russia Investigating Its Own Banks for Role in Suspicious Cash Movements

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The nation's top tax official said that his investigation was pointing to a single Russian bank as the architect of the transfer of billions of dollars into accounts under investigation in the United States.
Aleksandr Pochinok, the chief of the Russian State Tax Service, declined to name the bank. But he said in an interview that a small group of Russian businessmen appeared to have pioneered the practice of sending money through the Bank of New York accounts that are under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 "I think there is one main bank that was at least the ideological center," Mr. Pochinok said in an interview. "The operations were all done in a similar way. And a number of firms are connected with the people at this bank." The transfers themselves were carried out by a number of banks, and he said that a least 10 of them are under investigation.
The aim of the money-moving schemes, Mr. Pochinok said, was to hide income from the Russian tax authorities and avoid Russian taxes and tariffs.
The F.B.I. is looking at a group of accounts at the Bank of New York that American authorities say moved nearly $7 billion out of Russia. On Tuesday, a Federal indictment was unsealed in Manhattan charging three small American companies and three Russian immigrants with illegally operating a money transferring business. The bank, which is cooperating with the investigation, has not been accused of wrongdoing.
Since news of the Federal investigation at the Bank of New York surfaced in August, Russia's response has taken several turns. At first, Government officials dismissed the charges as a political campaign by Republicans in Congress to isolate Russia. They also brushed them off as an attempt to embarrass the Clinton Administration, especially Vice President Al Gore, who has touted his personal relationship with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a former Prime Minister of Russia.
Now the Kremlin's aim appears to be to remove the taint of corruption that has hurt all Russian businessman. The Russian Government has come under pressure by the United States to assist its investigation.
But the Russian anticorruption campaign has also raised concerns here that the Government may be looking for a convenient target or scapegoat to put the inquiry behind it and divert attention from allegations of kickbacks to the Government that are unrelated to the banking investigation.
The tax agency has conducted two well-publicized raids on Russian banks. While Mr. Pochinok has said he is investigating about 10 banks, he said today that he plans to check more banks next week. He declined to name all of them today, saying they might sue the Government for libel unless the authorities had proof.
He said he was concerned that some would destroy their computer and paper records before his investigators could get to them. Computer records at the first bank to be raided, Flamingo Bank of Moscow, seem to have been tampered with, he said.
That bank is the subject of a criminal investigation that opened last week. On Tuesday, the police raided Sobin Bank, which has had a long and lucrative relationship with the Russian Government and is owned by powerful business interests.
Mr. Pochinok said that investigators focused on Sobin Bank after discovering payments made to the bank by Flamingo. A third bank, Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank, has also come under suspicion by tax authorities.
These banks, in turn, have links with other Russian banks and businesses, which may also become targets of the Russian investigation. All have denied any violations.
"We are just following the path of the money," Mr. Pochinok said.
As the head of the State Tax Service, Mr. Pochinok is charged with finding violations of Russian tax laws. Mr. Pochinok said he has received no help from the United States.
He said the Russian investigation has already uncovered a huge number of transactions that went through the Bank of New York account established by the Benex International Company, which the F.B.I. said handled nearly $5 billion of the $7 billion in Russian funds.
"A great number of banks had relations with the Bank of New York," Mr. Pochinok said. "The majority of these are normal interbank relations. Unfortunately, among these operations there are some that were used to evade taxes.
"An enormous number of deals were made through Benex," he added. "And I have not uncovered all of them."
Mr. Pochinok said that Benex appeared to be well known to Russian businessmen.
"As far as I can tell, everyone knew that this firm could be used to send money," he said.
Many of the suspicions transactions uncovered by Russian investigators do not involve money laundering by criminal groups, but efforts to avoid Russian tariffs and taxes. The schemes, Mr. Pochinok said, took several forms. In transactions between Russian companies, for example, payments were made using a series of offshore banks, the Benex accounts at the Bank of New York and several Russian banks, he explained. "The idea of this scheme is conceal the source of the money," he said.
In another scheme, importers dodged tariffs by understating the value of the goods bought from foreign suppliers. The importers then made under-the-table payments to their foreign suppliers through the Benex accounts.
A third scheme, which was more popular before last year's economic crisis, was used to hide the high prices paid for Moscow apartments, Mr. Pochinok said. For a buyer wanting to pay $300,000 for an apartment, for example, the official price might be set at $30,000.
"You transfer $30,000, and $270,000 you send to the Bank of New York account to go to the sellers," he explained. "You are not interested to show that you have this kind of money, and the seller is not eager to pay the taxes from the sale."
Mr. Pochinok said that many transactions involving the Bank of New York were legal. To find a violation, he said the authorities must prove two things: the illegal export of hard currency and tax evasion.
"In many cases, we know we will be able to prove it," he said. "But for this we have to pin down the entire chain."
Although Russian authorities have taken their first steps to investigate the allegations pertaining to the Bank of New York, it is still unclear how far the inquiry will go. Powerful political interests have often shielded the banks from disciplinary action in the past.
But Mr. Pochinok insisted his inquiry would go on.
"We are adding several more to the list, and beginning next week will check several more," he said.

HEADLINE: Across the U.S., Universities Are Fueling High-Tech Economic Booms

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 7

 BODY:
Behold Kendall Square: 50-odd Cambridge acres long a fallow welter of former factories, now the flourishing center of what experts call the most concentrated single cluster of biotechnology in the world.
Behold it from, say, the muddy lot where Biogen Inc. broke ground this week on a new six-story laboratory. Within view lie the butterscotch-beige Genzyme building, the construction site of the coming Amgen building and a new complex housing smaller companies with typically futuristic names like Mitotix and Dyax and Variagenics, all new in the last few years, most connected in some way to two neighbors: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard. 
 "Biotech as far as the eye can see," Janice Bourque, executive director of the industry's Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, proclaimed with a bit of broad-brush artistic license.
The much-trumpeted "knowledge" (or information, or innovation) economy has its own geography, and it consists of much more than Silicon Valley. Across America, high technology is creating localized boomlets like the one in Kendall Square, which is home to companies not only in the biotech sector but also in software and related fields.
And if there is one never-absent factor at work on these silicon corners, experts say, it is the proximity of a research university shifting from ivory tower to revving economic engine. Indeed, the university is an increasingly powerful force in the knowledge economy, both because its brains are greater assets than ever before and because of a growing trend in which institutions of higher education see themselves as generators of business, whether professors' start-ups or technology licensing deals.
"There's a great awakening that we're sitting on top of a gunpowder keg" of growth, said David Lampe, author of two books on high-tech locales and associate vice president of Boston University, which is building a major biotechnology center of its own in Boston's South End.
A gunpowder keg in more ways than one. As universities and their communities, from Washington State to Georgia, strive for economic horsepower, a host of fresh questions are being raised about what a university's role should be, and what happens if the pursuit of money competes with the pursuit of knowledge. Other concerns arise as well, from congestion around the campus to the high potential that high-tech booms like Boston's first one, on Route 128 a quarter-century ago, can fizzle.
But to many, such concerns pale beside the possible benefits shown in research like the comparative study issued this summer by the independent Milken Institute, in Santa Monica, Calif. That study found that the fast-growing high-tech sector was increasingly "determining which metropolitan areas are succeeding or failing." In Milken's analysis, high-tech activity could explain 65 percent of the difference in economic growth among various metropolitan regions during the 1990's. And, it found, "research centers and institutions are undisputedly the most important factor in incubating high-tech industries." The institutions, experts say, provide nearby companies streams of cutting-edge knowledge as well as streams of smart labor.
Of course, universities have long churned out graduates and ideas that have turned into companies, and have created jobs simply by being huge institutional consumers. But in the knowledge economy, where ideas and information become lucrative products, these cultivators of knowledge are becoming more important than ever, some experts say, not only because of the new economic logic but also because of changes in academia itself.
The incentives for universities to think commercially are manifold, from their share of licensing payments, to the jobs created for graduates, to industry grants for research and even the ability to recruit professors who want a chance to get rich outside the classroom.
Some universities have for years been emphasizing the economic energy they provide and promoting a commercial orientation. In 1997, M.I.T. issued a report, "The Impact of Innovation," describing the impressive economic benefits flowing from the university, including the creation of 14,000 jobs in Cambridge alone at companies founded by its faculty and graduates.
Similarly, in 1995, the University of California distributed a report called "U.C. Means Business," which pointed out that, among other things, some 80 companies had been spun out of the university's San Diego campus, providing more than 7,000 jobs to the region, largely in biotech and biomedical companies.
Every one of the nine University of California campuses has a high-technology cluster near it, said Robert N. Shelton, the system's vice provost for research. And it is Silicon Valley's tale of genesis that it all began with garage-based start-ups and vision that came out of Stanford.
Other universities are just now joining in this promotion of a commercial emphasis. Last week Harvard, not exactly known as a dirty-fingernails kind of place, detailed for the first time the overall lift it gives the local economy. Neil L. Rudenstine, the university's president, underscored in a speech to the Boston Chamber of Commerce "the dynamic connections between Harvard, higher education and the rest of the economy -- the new knowledge economy we are building together."
With that interconnection in mind, said Paul Grogan, the university's vice president for community relations, Harvard is seeking new economic roles, even contemplating "research parks and business incubators that would be very closely tied to parts of the university."
Such roles, Mr. Grogan noted, raise "all sorts of new questions: where the lines are on this stuff, who owns what, how you use students --it's a million things, but these questions are part of something that is exciting and breaking molds."
Molds can be messy to break, however. Experts say many universities balk at commercialization of their long-sacrosanct intellectual pursuits. Serious issues can arise: everything from, say, the tension between a money-making engineering department and a poor English department to worries that "pure" basic research, with no business potential, will suffer.
Mary S. Spaeth, an expert in the field for Angle Technology, of London, said that in the transition from tower to marketplace, it had often been very difficult "for a university to reconcile those things and not feel it's compromising its integrity."
Reviews are mixed, too, on the impact that the high-technology boomlets spun out of universities have on local communities. Kendall Square, with its brick high-rises and cleverly rehabilitated factory buildings, may look palatial compared with its sludgy former self. But neighbors complain about the congestion it creates on some of the city's narrow streets, and that it is more of a Wall Street-style business center than a lively neighborhood mix.
Complaints often arise in such growing areas, said Annalee Saxenian, an associate professor of planning at the University of California at Berkeley who has written about Route 128 in the Boston area and about Silicon Valley.
"There have been cases," Dr. Saxenian said, "where growth that has been generated by the university spinoffs has displaced lower-income communities, so there are new tensions that emerge in some cases."
On the other hand, university officials say, town-gown relations tend to improve noticeably when a university becomes more market-oriented.
A generation ago, said Lita Nelsen, M.I.T.'s director of technology licensing, the university was seen in Cambridge as "this monster using up space and not paying taxes and scattering unwashed undergrads all over."
"Now," she said, "M.I.T. is seen as a partner in Cambridge in developing real estate and providing high-paying jobs in high-tech industry, and I think that relations have been enormously affected by it."
Dozens of university-linked research parks are already built or under construction around the country, so many that there is an Association of University-Related Research Parks, based in Washington, with nearly 200 member parks. Many of them are modeled on their granddaddies, North Carolina's Research Triangle Park and the Stanford Research Park, still thriving.
In other areas, university-side boomlets grow more spontaneously, as is the case with Kendall Square.
Biotechnology has a particular tendency to want to cluster near a university, several experts said, because it tends to have such a long research phase before coming up with marketable products. Further, it needs to be close to universities as the source of many of its employees, and near the affiliated hospitals where clinical trials can be run.
Henri A. Termeer, president of Genzyme, which employs nearly 4,000 people, said the company had been so intimately connected with M.I.T., from the postdoctoral students who did its early experiments to the professors who advise it and the graduates it now hires, that it most likely could not have got going elsewhere. "If you had the same ideas but you were away from these kinds of skills, this very advanced leading-edge level, you could not carry it out," Mr. Termeer said. "You wouldn't get there. You would just stay with the idea."
Kendall Square is far from the only home to Boston-area biotech, and over all, California, with its Biotech Coast, has more such companies than Massachusetts. But Ms. Bourque, of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, said that within a radius of five miles or so of the square, there were some 70 biotech companies, making this the most concentrated cluster anywhere. And almost everyone, she said, has a sense that this is only the beginning, that "we're not even in the golden years yet."
Kendall Square has seen something a lot like this before. In the industrial era, it was the odoriferous home to everything from a soap factory to meat-renderers. Then it hit a period of decline. It did not help that under President John F. Kennedy, the Federal Government cleared whole swaths of it, planning to erect here the space center that, under President Lyndon B. Johnson, went to Houston instead.
The square's current dense amalgam of laboratories, offices and hotels began taking shape in the 1980's, but lately, said James C. Mullen, president and chief operating officer of Biogen, "it is an explosion."
M.I.T. has done this before, too. It was seen as the primary academic engine behind the high-technology cluster on Route 128; but then that area fell from grace, as the industry shifted from its mini-computers to personal computers. In her book "Regional Advantage," (Harvard University Press, 1994), Dr. Saxenian, of Berkeley, posited that Route 128 suffered, while Silicon Valley bounced back, in large part because of differences in business culture: the more hidebound and high-walled Eastern companies outdone by smaller and more cooperative Western ones.
But Kendall Square, with its fluent flow among companies and academia, seems to be avoiding the mistakes of Route 128, she said.
"We have a joke here that the only place that isn't trying to replicate Silicon Valley is Silicon Valley," she said. In a small way, she said, "I think Kendall Square has achieved it."

HEADLINE: Nobel Winner Is to Head Cancer Center

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Dr. Harold E. Varmus, the Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist who has presided over the National Institutes of Health during the greatest expansion in its 112-year history, told President Clinton yesterday that he would resign at the end of the year to become president and chief executive of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
When he left the University of California at San Francisco to go to Washington six years ago, Dr. Varmus had never run anything larger than a research laboratory. His tenure at the National Institutes of Health was blessed by a good economy and an explosion in biomedical research, and he took advantage of both to persuade Congress to increase the agency's budget vastly, to nearly $15.6 billion this year from $10.3 billion in 1993, with a $2 billion increase last year alone. 
 At Sloan-Kettering, Dr. Varmus, 59, will meet entirely new challenges. He is a basic scientist -- he won "the Prize," as he calls it, in 1989 for the discovery of a family of cancer-causing genes.
In New York, he will be forced to face something perhaps even more intractable than a divided Congress: a rapidly evolving payer system in which managed care, so far mostly disdained by the hospital, rules. He will now also find himself dealing with insurance payment contracts and market share wars.
The appointment of Dr. Varmus suggests that Memorial Sloan-Kettering is hoping to move in a new direction. Its president, Dr. Paul Marks, 73, who is retiring, developed the center's research base, but now, its directors say, they hope to merge that research with ongoing cancer treatment.
Dr. Varmus was selected foremost for his clinical talents, said Dr. William Hoskins, the deputy physician-in-chief of disease management at Sloan-Kettering, who served on the search committee. "Most of us in cancer realize the time is ripe to begin the process of bringing the lab to the bedside," he said. "I think he has the vision to do that."
In recent years many area hospitals have elbowed their way into cancer care, drawing on a huge base of patients who increasingly must pay for their treatment under H.M.O. programs. Dr. Marks, who often hobnobbed with famous donors and patients like Evelyn H. Lauder, has shown little interest in this issue, focusing instead on the development of the center's research arm and endowment.
In an interview yesterday, Dr. Varmus said that while he has mixed emotions about leaving the National Institutes of Health, he is ready for a change after six years of Government work. "I wanted to run another organization," he said, "and be in a position to see the fruits of 25 or 30 years of cancer research in the lab come to fulfillment."
When Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, suggested Dr. Varmus for the N.I.H. director's job, what most people knew about him was that he had won the Nobel Prize, that he wore rumpled clothes (he still does) and rode his bicycle 12 miles to work.
"Most people didn't know if he had the temperament to do the political work, because it's an enormously political job," said Dr. Herbert Pardes, dean of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. "I think he outperformed the most optimistic expectations that anybody had."
He is credited with lifting flagging morale among scientists, both inside and outside the agency, by recruiting some of the best minds in academia to the N.I.H. "He really understood the plight of investigators today," said Dr. William R. Brinkley, former president of the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biologists.
And Dr. Varmus proved himself an adroit politician, keeping a low profile as he navigated such tricky ethical issues as the still-unsettled question of whether the Government should pay for research on human embryonic stem cells.
In a statement today, Dr. Shalala said Dr. Varmus's appointment to N.I.H. was "one of the greatest accomplishments of this Administration."
Representative John E. Porter, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee that handles N.I.H. appropriations, said, "While none of us are irreplaceable, he comes about as close to it as, I think, anyone does."
With its 25 separate institutes and centers, the N.I.H., which sprawls over a vast campus of brick buildings and rolling hills in Bethesda, Md., is one of the world's premier agencies for scientific research.
Dr. Varmus told the directors of the N.I.H. that he was leaving during a staff meeting yesterday morning, and then sent an E-mail message to the agency's employees, who number about 16,000.
The meeting was emotional, said Dr. Richard Klausner, director of the National Cancer Institute. "There was a sense of the passing of an era, an era about which we all feel very good."
But there was not universal approval of Dr. Varmus's leadership. Patient advocacy groups often complained that with his interest in basic science, Dr. Varmus did not pay enough attention to their needs, and complained bitterly at his refusal to fund research on specific diseases. Dr. Varmus's philosophy was that "a rising tide lifts all boats." He believed that an understanding of how cells work and other matters of human biology would lead to discoveries in all diseases.
"The message out of N.I.H. to the disease groups always seemed to be, 'Well, everything we do here benefits everything,' " said William T. Schmidt, a spokesman for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. "Of course, that was very difficult for people to buy. It just didn't sell well with our constituency."
And it also did not sell well with the Institute of Medicine, an independent research arm of the National Academy of Sciences. In a report last year, the Institute criticized the N.I.H. for not paying enough attention to patients and urged the Federal health agency to more systematically consider the deaths and suffering caused by specific diseases when setting its research priorities.
At Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Dr. Varmus will be greeted with open arms, said Dr. Raymond P. Warrell Jr., an attending physician and member of Sloan-Kettering.
"The clinical staff is hugely excited," he said. "The biggest challenge is to integrate basic science programs to the direct care of patients with cancer as quickly as possible. It is a challenge that many cancer centers have faced and the fact that he faced them on a national level is a huge plus."

HEADLINE: Bradley Wants More Spending To Ease Stresses on Families

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: PETERBOROUGH, N.H., Oct. 7

 BODY:
Former Senator Bill Bradley offered his prescription for the stresses on families of global economic competition, calling today for $3.6 billion a year in new Federal spending to expand day care services, improve community colleges and encourage the elderly to work with children.
Speaking in a crowded high school gym in this rustic mountain hamlet, Mr. Bradley said the idyllic "Norman Rockwell" world he had known as a child in Missouri had all but disappeared, replaced by a high-pressure economy that often forced both parents to work and left them little time for their children. 
 "The new global economy just doesn't care about the 6:30 dinner," Mr. Bradley told more than 1,000 students and supporters. "It doesn't care that you don't know how to use a computer. The global economy isn't worrying about you at all."
Mr. Bradley's speech came at a time when he is battling his lone rival for the Democratic Presidential nomination, Vice President Al Gore, for the support of labor unions. Leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. are debating whether to issue an endorsement at the labor federation's meeting next week.
Like the Vice President, Mr. Bradley has come under heavy criticism from many labor leaders for supporting trade policies, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, that have spurred global competition and caused, they say, layoffs and other economic dislocations for American workers.
Today, Mr. Bradley, a former New York Knick forward who went on to represent New Jersey for three terms in the Senate, asserted that he understood the strains of juggling parenthood with work, describing how he prepared frozen dinners for his daughter in Washington while his wife, Ernestine, taught college courses back home.
"When I took the oath of office, I raised my right hand high, but in my left hand I held Theresa Anne," he said, referring to his daughter, the couple's only child.
Today's speech, the second of four major policy addresses he plans to make this fall, came a week after Mr. Bradley outlined his proposal for extending health insurance to most Americans. Though Mr. Bradley has criticized Mr. Gore for taking an "incremental" approach to fixing the nation's problems, the plan he outlined today seemed relatively modest in scope, and included these elements:
*Mr. Bradley would create a $2 billion-a-year program to finance day care and other programs for the preschool children of working parents of all income levels. Modeled after a North Carolina program called "Smart Start," Mr. Bradley's plan would allow committees of local officials, business leaders, child-care workers and parents to allocate the Federal grants. The money could also be spent on counseling or education programs.
*He called for giving $400 million a year in grants to community colleges, an increase of nearly a third over current Federal support. The money could be used to improve programs intended to place students in jobs in the local economy or to retrain older workers whose jobs have changed or been eliminated by technological advancements. "A pair of strong hands are not what they used to be," Mr. Bradley said. "Now those hands have to be able to use a keyboard."
*He proposed $200-a-month stipends to the elderly for working 15 hours a week with young people in approved programs like tutoring or counseling.
*And he advocated expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires employers with 50 or more employees to give workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year for reasons like childbirth or family illnesses. Mr. Bradley would expand the law to cover employers with 25 or more workers, bringing 12 million more people into its reach. He would also require employers to give workers 24 unpaid hours a year for less pressing situations, like parent-teacher conferences.
Mr. Gore has called for a similar expansion of the leave act, as well as for increasing Federal subsidies for day care services. He has proposed providing tax incentives to companies that offer day care services. And he has called for eliminating the so-called marriage penalty, which causes spouses filing joint returns to pay higher taxes than single people.
Recent polls have shown Mr. Bradley and Mr. Gore in a dead heat in New Hampshire, the site of the nation's first primary, next February.
Though Mr. Bradley received a standing ovation from the students, it was clear many of them had no idea who he was. To underscore that point, the principal, Susan Dell, said in her introduction of the candidate that not a single student in one ninth-grade class had heard of Mr. Bradley, despite his candidacy and place in the basketball Hall of Fame.
"I probably would know this guy if he ever had played basketball," one of the students told his teacher, Ms. Dell said.

American Home Products To Settle Diet-Drug Case
American Home Products agreed to pay $3.75 billion to thousands of people who contend they were injured by taking the popular diet pill combination fen-phen. 
 Under the settlement -- one of the largest ever in a product liability case -- people who used one of the diet drugs for 60 days or less would be eligible for $30 to $60 prescription refunds, while those who have a heart valve injury could receive up to $1.5 million. Page A1.
 
Fed to Review Disclosure Policy
Concerned that its latest attempt to be more open might be confusing investors, the Federal Reserve has established a panel to review its new practice of disclosing once-secret decisions about tilting policy toward raising or reducing interest rates. The establishment of the committee was disclosed in the minutes of the Aug. 24 Fed meeting, where the central bank raised interest rates. The minutes showed that the increase was approved 9 to 1. The dissenter was Robert D. McTeer Jr., a leading advocate of the theory that the economy is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth. C7.
 
Sweden Goes Against the Grain
At a time when world leaders are fascinated by the United States' economic success and its credo of less government and low taxes, Sweden seems to be defying gravity. The Government consumes nearly 60 percent of the national economy, and taxes and wages are among the highest in the world. Yet this largely unreconstructed welfare state is one of Europe's most vibrant economies. A1.

The on-line grocer Webvan Group delayed a stock offering, not because it had more selling to do to investors but because it had done too much already. The company appears to have run afoul of regulators by giving out unpublished information in a conference call. C2.

HEADLINE: Mr. Vajpayee's India

 BODY:
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India has won an impressive election victory that gives his coalition a chance to survive longer than recent governments in New Delhi. Stability would be a welcome development after a succession of inconclusive elections and short-lived ruling coalitions, including Mr. Vajpayee's, which collapsed in April. No less encouraging is his promise to revive negotiations with Pakistan, speed economic liberalization and refrain from steps hostile to Muslims and other minorities. Progress on these fronts should make the world breathe easier and clear the way for President Clinton to visit next year.
Mr. Vajpayee's triumph was helped along by a growing economy and the voters' yearning for an end to unsettled governments. Voters also appear to have been impressed by his confident but restrained handling of the intrusion of Pakistani-backed militants in the disputed state of Kashmir during the summer. Indian forces repulsed the invaders without widening the conflict, while Indian diplomats got the United States and other countries to press Pakistan for the militants' withdrawal. 
 The cause of reducing regional tensions needs immediate attention. India and Pakistan, which both exploded nuclear devices last year, must quickly fulfill their commitment to signing the nuclear Test Ban Treaty and try to reach agreements on curbing missile testing and producing nuclear materials. They also need to resume discussions on preventing the Kashmir dispute from spinning into a wider war.
As 360 million Indians voted over the last month, the world's largest and most fractious democracy once again set a stirring example for all nations. For Mr. Vajpayee, the victory was more precarious than he might have wished. His Bharatiya Janata Party actually lost seats in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, a longtime party stronghold. But he can savor the vote as a gesture of confidence in his leadership. He is now the first Indian Prime Minister to win back-to-back elections since Indira Gandhi in 1971. He has also managed to rid his party of some of its Hindu chauvinist reputation by agreeing not to institute the party's most virulent anti-Muslim measures.
Meanwhile, the election dealt a significant defeat to the Congress Party, which had turned to Sonia Gandhi, the daughter-in-law of Indira and widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Mrs. Gandhi had been drafted to help save the party, but after stirring up some initial excitement, she stumbled.
India's rich diversity sometimes looks like an obstacle to unity. But the latest election has proved that a commitment to resolving differences peacefully and democratically can transform diversity into a source of strength.

Treaty's Fate Tied to U.S.
Speakers at a conference convened to press for ratification of the nuclear test-ban treaty -- including two of the major holdouts, Russia and China -- suggested that the ban might founder if it was not ratified by the United States Senate. The Clinton Administration and Senate Republicans agree that the ban faces nearly certain defeat if it comes to a vote, so the major discussion has been about whether, and how, to postpone the vote -- and keep the treaty alive -- at least until next year. A11 

Scientists in charge of maintaining the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear arsenal said they might not be able to accomplish that without the testing that would be outlawed under the treaty. A11

HEADLINE: Bush Challenges the Orthodoxy But Is Still a Devout Conservative

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
For as long as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has been describing himself as a "compassionate conservative," Republicans and Democrats alike have wondered whether the phrase was a call for a flexible new ideology or an effort to put a friendlier face on an essentially unchanged philosophy.
Mr. Bush's public statements, including his denunciation this week of his party's focus on wealth, suggest a willingness to use his commanding position in the Republican Presidential race to challenge some of the party's assumptions about what it stands for. 
 But as he starts to take positions, particularly on prominent issues like taxes and economic policy, Mr. Bush is by no means abandoning the basic conservative principles that have defined the party at least since the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Bush is clearly trying a delicate balancing act, seeking to retain the faith of the Republican Party's conservative base even as he courts the moderate voters he would need to win the general election. And beyond political positioning, Mr. Bush's lack of specificity may also reflect the early stage of the campaign, when candidates are still formulating policy positions, as well as some debate within his campaign about how far he should tilt in either direction.
"He's still a work in progress," said William A. Niskanen, an economic adviser in the Reagan Administration who is now chairman of the Cato Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington.
On the campaign trail and in meetings with his policy advisers, Mr. Bush emphasizes a traditional conservative belief in the power of free markets and is as enthusiastic as any Reagan-era supply-sider in calling for tax cuts.
His economic advisers, many of whom served in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, are drawn from centers of orthodox conservative thought like the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization in Washington.
The advisers' basic thrust remains reducing marginal tax rates, a step that cuts tax bills proportionally more for the wealthy, who pay the most taxes, than for middle- and lower-income people. And they back tax cuts that Democrats have long said are skewed to the rich, including the elimination of the inheritance tax on large estates.
Where Mr. Bush and his team seem to be taking a fresh approach is in applying conservative orthodoxy in new ways.
They point out, for example, that high marginal tax rates can be more of a problem for a single mother working her way out of poverty than for an investment banker. As workers move from income levels associated with the working poor -- below $20,000 a year -- into middle-class income levels, they often lose all or part of tax breaks like the earned income tax credit, and enter higher tax brackets, meaning that a big chunk of their additional earnings goes to taxes.
The main policy idea behind "compassionate conservatism" is to help people in that kind of situation, probably through an expansion of the earned income tax credit or through other changes to the tax code that would allow low- to middle-income workers to take home more of what they earn.
"Governor Bush understands and very much believes that high marginal tax rates create enormous disincentives," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor who heads the candidate's economic policy team. "What may be new here is the realization, which he's talked about on the stump, that high marginal rates affect not only high-income people but a lot of low-income people as well."
In addition to Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's economic team includes Michael Boskin, who was chief economist in the Bush White House; John F. Cogan, a former budget aide to President Reagan; Martin S. Feldstein, a former Reagan Administration chief economist; John B. Taylor, an expert on monetary policy who worked on Bob Dole's 1996 Presidential campaign, and R. Glenn Hubbard, who was a Treasury Department official under President Bush.
Members of the team say they consider themselves technicians, simply taking the goals laid out by Mr. Bush and finding ways of translating them into workable policies. Yet there is concern among other Republicans working with Mr. Bush that the campaign will be too tentative in trying to redefine the party, and will miss an opportunity to broaden its appeal.
Especially after the failure of the big Republican tax cut to generate much public enthusiasm before it was vetoed by President Clinton, some Republicans would like to see Mr. Bush support a tax plan that clearly repositions the party toward the political center by adopting some of the approaches supported by the Democrats, including more tax breaks targeted to the middle class.
"The reason why it is so important for Governor Bush's plan to lean in the direction of those left behind," said one adviser to Mr. Bush, speaking on the condition of anonymity, "is because it's the right policy and the right politics if we want to recapture the idea of being the party of the middle class."
Outside of his economic team, Mr. Bush's most influential advisers include a number of advocates of new approaches to domestic policy, including Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis; Mike Gerson, the governor's speechwriter and a senior policy adviser, and Marvin Olasky, a conservative theoretician who advocates harnessing faith-based programs and charities to address social ills.
Last week Mr. Bush effectively shot down a proposal by Republicans in the House to delay payments to the working poor under the earned income tax credit program, saying Congress should not balance the budget "on the backs of the poor." And on Wednesday he said that Republicans had too often "focused on the national economy, to the exclusion of all else," and that the strongest argument for conservative ideals should be "that they lead to greater justice, less suffering, more opportunity."
Mr. Bush has angered some Republican members of Congress with his criticism of how the party has conducted itself, and he has been attacked by several of his rivals for the Republican Party's nomination, including Steve Forbes and Gary L. Bauer, for being insufficiently conservative on both economic and social policy.
Yet there has not been any widespread uprising against Mr. Bush by conservatives, in part because of his big lead in the polls. And his advisers suggest that he seems to have a Reaganesque ability to communicate a conservative agenda in a nonthreatening way that defuses Democratic attempts to portray the Republican party as mean spirited.
"He has publicly said he is a supply-sider, and when he says that he says it with a passion that gives conservatives in the Republican party more comfort than they get from candidates who are viewed as more conservative," said Representative Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio who is working with the Bush campaign.
"At the same time he's comfortable focusing on issues like charitable giving," Mr. Portman said. "Perhaps what he is showing us is that because of the power of his personality or the strength of his passion, he can break through and persuade people that these are not inconsistent."

HEADLINE: Fen-Phen Maker to Pay Billions In Settlement of Diet-Injury Cases

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
The American Home Products Corporation agreed yesterday to pay $3.75 billion in total to thousands of people who contend they were injured by taking the popular diet pill combination fen-phen.
Under the settlement -- one of the largest ever in a product liability case -- people who used one of the diet drugs for 60 days or less would be eligible for $30 to $60 prescription refunds, while those who have a heart valve injury could receive as much as $1.5 million. 
 While executives and industry analysts hailed the agreement -- which came after months of negotiations and whose terms were widely expected -- as a way for the company to put an embarrassing problem behind it, yesterday's agreement does not shield American Home Products from all fen-phen liabilities.
Some six million people took the diet drugs Pondimin, American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine, the "fen" in fen-phen, and Redux, a similar drug.
The drugs were hailed earlier in the decade as miracle pills for obesity, as an alternative to pure diet and exercise. Diet centers actively promoted the pills to the obese and even to people who wanted to lose a few pounds. In 1996, doctors wrote 18 million prescriptions for the two drugs.
But in September 1997, the company removed the drugs from the market at the request of the Food and Drug Administration after studies linked them to heart valve damage.
Pondimin and Redux depressed appetite, while the other drug in the combination, phentermine, increased the rate at which calories were burned. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic reported heart valve defects in the summer of 1996.
Since the drugs were pulled off the market, some 6,500 lawsuits encompassing 11,000 people have been filed. Yesterday's settlement covers all of the six million who took fen-phen, but only those who are found to have heart valve problems can collect from an injury award fund that the company will establish. The agreement, which must be approved by United States District Court Judge Louis C. Bechtle of Philadelphia, also has some strings attached.
It does not cover the 100 claims the company's faces from people who contend fen-phen gave them primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal lung illness. And if too many people -- a number American Home Products did not define yesterday -- choose to drop out of the settlement and pursue an individual lawsuit, the company could scrap the agreement. Lawyers for fen-phen users said that was an unlikely outcome.
"We made this settlement flexible so that more people will participate in it," said Stanley Chesley, a partner with Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley in Cincinnati, one of the lead plaintiff lawyers. "The way this settlement is set up, the consumers have no disadvantage."
For American Home Products, the settlement is the latest in a series of moves over the last three months intended to resolve long-standing problems.
In July, the company agreed to pay $54 million to settle claims of women who said they were not adequately warned about the side effects of the company's Norplant birth control device. Just two days ago, American Home Products announced that it would restructure its agricultural division, slicing 700 positions from the unit.
"I feel good about the able efforts of our attorneys to bring about the settlement," said John R. Stafford, chief executive officer of American Home Products. "For our consumers, the settlement will give them a quick and fair resolution. I feel good about that."
Plaintiff lawyers who negotiated the settlement said the agreement was especially comprehensive. The settlement, valued at $3.75 billion before inflation, will be divided into two funds. One fund, valued at $1 billion, will pay for drug refunds and medical screening costs.
The second fund, valued at $2.55 billion, will pay personal injury claims, with awards ranging up to $1.5 million. The remaining $200 million from the $3.75 billion total has been set aside for legal fees for medical monitoring claims.
The fund will remain open for up to 16 years, leaving American Home Products liable for a higher payout. Plaintiff's lawyers calculated yesterday that with interest, American Home Products could pay as much as $4.83 billion. That would put fen-phen as one of the highest product injury settlements ever, dwarfing the $3.2 billion Dow Corning paid last year to settle its silicone breast implant claims.
"Even with the $4 billion settlement, you have to say that American Home Products pulled off a good settlement," said David Saks, a managing director at Gruntal & Company. "Some of the early estimates were everywhere from $3 billion to $10 billion. The company was stuck in a quicksand of uncertainty."
The fen-phen settlement also represents a bit of unusual legal maneuvering. It is rare for a national class-action settlement to allow participants to "opt out" and pursue an individual case at three separate points. Under the settlement, consumers can opt out in the beginning, when they discover they have a leaky heart value during the screening process, or when they learn the amount of their injury award.
When the outlines of the settlement began to emerge three weeks ago, analysts expressed concern that American Home Products was being too lenient, because a large number of consumers could still pursue litigation, leaving the company to face a large amount of liabilities.
Yet, the fen-phen settlement is not as lenient as first feared by analysts. Consumers can drop out at those three points, but if they do so at the final two stages -- the screening process and the payout -- they cannot seek punitive damages against American Home Products in an individual case.
While many plaintiff lawyers are thrilled with the settlement, others are annoyed at some of its details. For example, in order for consumers to receive money from the personal injury fund they must suffer heart valve leaks that are measurable on a scale used by the Food and Drug Administration.
Some lawyers complained that the only thing many consumers may receive is a refund for their prescriptions.
"The payments are not going to be large enough to cover medical expenses for a large number of people," said Ed Blizzard, a Houston lawyer who represents fen-phen users. "A large number of people only receive money for what they paid for the drugs."
The settlement, if approved by the court, provides a sum for lawyers' fees of up to $429 million -- $200 million from the monitoring fund and $229 million included in the personal injury fund. Mr. Chesley said he expected about 100 lawyers to collect fees.
American Home Products said yesterday that it would take a $3.29 billion after-tax charge against third-quarter earnings to pay for the settlement.
Analysts were optimistic that the company's stock would increase now that it had moved aggressively to put the fen-phen liabilities behind it. Shares of American Home Product rose $3.5625, or 7.8 percent, yesterday to close at $48.6875.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
George W. Bush, through his experience as Governor of Texas, has somehow arrived at the conclusion that it takes money to run social programs and has decided to take his party to task purely out of his conviction that we should do the right thing for our poor and disenfranchised (editorial, Oct. 6). However, as a Texan, I can assure you it is only a sweet dream. 
 Texas is at or near the bottom of all states when it comes to health care, education and just about any social program you can name. And while Mr. Bush has always made speeches about leaving no one behind, the only legislation he ever really pushed in Austin ended up benefiting business. I'm afraid his newly professed "compassionate conservatism" and his distancing himself from the Republican leadership is nothing more than a chimera.

HEADLINE: Don't Put Strings on Debt Relief

 BODY:

To the Editor:
President Clinton's pledge to cancel the debts of poor countries (editorial, Oct. 4) is welcome. But as you point out, only four countries have qualified for debt relief from the International Monetary Fund, and "it took years of I.M.F.-imposed austerity to do so." 
 In fact, the I.M.F.'s austerity measures have increased poor countries' debt and worsened conditions for their people.
President Clinton's debt initiative requires poor countries to comply with three years of I.M.F.-imposed economic reforms. Debt relief should not be preconditioned on economic reforms directed by the I.M.F. It is needed immediately and unconditionally.

To the Editor:
"Unburdening the Third World" (editorial, Oct. 4) was a reminder of how so much good can be done for so little money. Forgiving the debt the world's poorest countries owe to the United States, as President Clinton proposes, would cost only about $1.20 per American for three years, but it would relieve human misery on a scale most of us can only imagine. 
 An important part of American jurisprudence is the concept of bankruptcy: if people fall upon hard times through misfortune, they should not have to pay for it the rest of their lives. Let us extend this kindly principle to those who need it most.

HEADLINE: Chase Is Moving 3,500 of Its Jobs From New York

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the largest corporate employer in New York City, is moving 10 percent of its jobs -- 3,500 positions -- to Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, the company told its workers yesterday.
This may well be the largest exodus of jobs from the city; officials and corporate consultants said they could not remember a bigger relocation by a single company. But in the late 1980's, many Wall Street firms began moving their "back office" record-keeping and data processing jobs to New Jersey and Florida, a trend that Chase is now catching up with. 
 Beginning next year, Chase will move two entire back-office units, from entry-level positions to technology workers to senior managers, said Ken Herz, a spokesman for the company. One of the businesses transfers money for companies; the other involves tracking and processing stock and bond trades.
By relocating its workers, the bank will cut its costs significantly, Mr. Herz said, though he would not say how much money it expected to save. Salaries, real estate costs, taxes, telecommunications charges and utilities costs are all lower in Tampa, Fla., and Dallas, where most of the jobs are to be relocated. Some would also be moved to Lowell, Mass.
But the savings are so big that Chase did not even approach the city for financial or logistical help to try to keep the jobs in New York, Mr. Herz said. "There was no way the city could come up with enough money," he added. "These are very significant savings."
"We're always sorry to see any jobs go," said Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine. But, he said, Chase has promised to keep its headquarters and core business in the city and will be expanding its other operations. The company, which Mr. Levine said was looking for a million square feet, has been searching unsuccessfully for space in which to expand.
Technological advances have prompted banks to slash the number of employees in the city over the last decade, as have mergers; Chase, for example, combined with Chemical Bank. Employment at depository institutions has fallen from almost 175,000 in 1988 to about 110,000 today, according to the State Labor Department.
Many of the jobs that have disappeared were held by middle-class people earning middle-income salaries, leading some economists and government officials to worry that New York is increasingly becoming a city of the very rich and very poor. "It's a constant worry, that all the middle-class finance jobs are going, that the banks can't afford to keep them here," said one former city official.
The city government has offered financial incentives to large companies that threatened to leave the city; Chase received $235 million in 1988, when it agreed to move many back-office employees to Brooklyn, rather than New Jersey. It now has about 6,000 employees at Brooklyn's Metrotech Center office complex, which is full.
Some Metrotech jobs are among those that are being moved, Mr. Herz said, adding that Chase planned to relocate other business units to Metrotech to keep it full.
Most of the employees whose jobs are being moved work at the tip of Manhattan, at 4 New York Plaza and 55 Water Street. While Chase said it would offer to relocate many of those workers, several interviewed yesterday said they were unlikely to go.
"I guess if you're single or live with your parents, you could pack up and move, but I can't," one middle-aged employee said. "We constantly get letters from the chairman saying you're doing a great job; now, we really feel betrayed."
The city's Metrotech deal with Chase particularly rankled some, another employee said. "It's a sorry state," he complained. "Here's a major corporation that receives tax abatements from the city, and part of that deal is to bring jobs to the city. Slowly but surely, they move operations."
One reason that employees may be reluctant to relocate is that their chances of finding work in New York City are unusually good, corporate consultants said. The unemployment rate in the city is 6.9 percent, down from roughly 10 percent in early 1997, and many companies are adding new jobs at a record pace.
"Most people will find jobs in a couple of months, definitely," said Dennis J. Donovan, a partner in the Wadley-Donovan Group, which advises companies on relocations.
That was not the case in the late 1980's, when Merrill Lynch moved 2,500 back-office jobs to Jersey City. Or, in the mid-1990's, when several big financial firms threatened to move to Stamford, and Swiss Bank actually did, taking 1,300 jobs with it. Citigroup, which employs about 25,000 people in the city, has for years had its stock custodial business in Tampa, a Citigroup spokesman, Jack Morris, said.
Companies have discovered that they can have administrative tasks performed almost anywhere, even overseas, said Daniel Malachuck, a partner at Arthur Andersen who specializes in business location services. Some of his clients, he said, have moved their back-office operations to New Delhi and Manila.
At the same time, however, companies and their employees have become far more optimistic about staying in New York City, Mr. Malachuck said, and less inclined to move to another part of the country.
"We don't know what the post-Rudy mind-set will be, but people feel better about the city and their situation," he said. "And people have been to some of those other places."

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions yesterday about the decision by the Chase Manhattan Corporation to move 3,500 jobs out of New York City referred imprecisely to the portion of the company's work force involved. The positions to be relocated amount to 10 percent of Chase's work force in the New York metropolitan area, not of its entire work force, which numbers 76,500 employees across the country.

Sweden, the Welfare State, Basks in a New Prosperity

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM

 BODY:
At a time when world leaders are fascinated by the United States' economic success and its credo of less government and low taxes, Sweden seems to be defying gravity.
This is still, after all, a country where government consumes nearly 60 percent of the national economy, far above the 32 percent share in the United States. Taxes and wages are among the highest in the world. Dismissing a sluggish worker is, in nearly all cases, legally impossible. 
 And the Swedes are proud of it. When Prime Minister Goran Persson introduced his budget plans in mid-September, he promised that "Sweden will consolidate its position as a leading welfare nation." He even pledged to create another entitlement: the right of every person who turns 65 to retain a personal assistant.
Yet this largely unreconstructed welfare state is one of Europe's most vibrant economies. And after nearly three decades of sluggishness in which the output per person slumped from the third-highest in the world to 18th, just behind Italy, the Swedish economy is in the midst of a powerful transformation.
Sweden's recent boom is in part a cyclical recovery from back-to-back recessions. But it also reflects a wider pattern in Europe and a particularly nuanced reaction to the robust United States economy of the 90's. For even as Sweden, like many countries in Western Europe, is continuing to preserve traditional European social programs, it has also been embracing entrepreneurship and unrestricted competition.
While the Government continues to finance health care, education and many social services, Sweden has deregulated industries from telecommunications to airlines and banking.
As a result, new companies and high technology have flourished. Indeed, much of the growth here is coming from businesses that did not exist 10 years ago. Information technology and service companies have eclipsed traditional manufacturers as the main source of new jobs.
"It is mostly a cyclical upswing, but it is more than that," said Anne Wibble, chief economist at the Swedish Federation of Industry. "It is also a breakthrough of the private service sector -- the new networked economy."
Growth for 1999 is now projected at 3.8 percent, far faster than Europe as a whole and close to the recent growth rate in the United States. Foreign corporations from Ford to Microsoft are pumping billions of dollars into the country. The Government, which five years ago carried a deficit equivalent to 11 percent of the gross domestic product, now has a budget surplus.
Unemployment has declined from 8.2 percent in 1993 to 6.1 percent recently, and there are estimates for the year as low as 5.3 percent. The Stockholm area has shortages of computer specialists, sales representatives, teachers, even caterers.
Sweden is not the only country to challenge some central tenets of the current American-British model. France, where the Socialist Cabinet has mandated that the workweek will fall to 35 hours, is growing by nearly 3 percent and its double-digit jobless rate is coming down. Finland has high personal taxes and rigid job rules, yet it has become a world leader in the mobile phone industry. The Netherlands still has generous welfare programs, but offers the industrialist or entrepreneur low corporate taxes and flexible labor rules.
For all the talk of "Euro-sclerosis," Europe is a continent today of budget-cutting, negligible inflation and, most important, increasingly brutal market competition.
Sweden's boom is arguably the most unusual. Besides clinging to a cradle-to-grave system of security, Sweden was one of just a few countries refusing to join with 11 European nations in adopting the euro as a common currency.
Yet Sweden is growing faster than most of its euro zone neighbors. Germany, which accounts for one-third of the euro zone's total economy, is expected to grow less than 2 percent this year.
To be sure, no one here is yet talking about a new "Swedish model" for growth. But a few years ago, this country was a textbook illustration of how good intentions can lead to disastrous results. In 1970, Sweden's economic output per person was the third highest in the world, behind only Switzerland and the United States. With its wealth and a culture of high-minded homogeneity, Sweden built up one of the world's legendary welfare states. But as the public sector ballooned, swelling from one-third to more than half the economy, business and productivity lagged behind the world as a whole. Unsurprisingly, job creation stagnated. And today, despite the recent upswing, Sweden still employs slightly fewer people than it did in 1970.
So what lies behind the current rebound? One major change is that Swedish political leaders have finally put the budget in order. After running up staggering deficits in the mid-1990's, at one point as high as 13 percent of output, the Social Democratic Government, while rejecting most demands to cut back the welfare state, raised personal taxes and imposed tough spending limits.
The measures were painful, but they steadily reduced the deficit and gave corporations some room to breathe.
But that was only part of the story. Like Finland and Britain, Sweden moved much more quickly than most other European countries to deregulate its markets and foster a more entrepreneurial culture. It opened its telephone and electricity markets to competition in the mid-90's. It jumped into the vanguard of mobile telephones, as Ericsson emerged as one of the world's biggest producers of wireless phones and networking equipment.
Beginning in 1993, the country also loosened up its job rules. Though full-time employees are still protected from layoffs, the Government allowed companies to hire temporary workers who could be let go at will.
The result has been a torrid expansion of temporary-employment companies. Manpower Inc., one of the world's biggest, now employs 6,000 workers in Sweden. Poolia, a temporary agency in Stockholm, has more than 1,700 workers and has nearly doubled its force of what it terms consultants in the last year alone.
But perhaps the biggest change has been the rise of new companies, many sprouting from Ericsson's roots in the telecommunications industry and many others emerging from the Nordic countries' infatuation with the Internet.
According to a recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Sweden invested a larger part of its gross domestic product in "knowledge" -- research, development, training and education -- than any other country in the world.
Consider the expansion of the Kiska Science Park, an industrial park started by Ericsson and I.B.M. in the early 1970's. Situated on a former waste site, Kiska is now a sprawling complex with 600 technology companies and 27,000 workers. It has also attracted two of Sweden's important scientific institutes -- the Royal Institute of Technology and the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.
Stockholm itself has become a breeding ground for Internet companies. Johan Ihrfelt and a group of friends began Spray.se as an Internet consulting firm back in 1995. After raising about $3 million from private investors, including the huge Swedish holding company Investor AB, they opened an Internet portal and access service. Based in a renovated brick warehouse here, Spray now employs about 250 people across Europe and has 450,000 customers.
"I believe Sweden is one of the most exciting markets after the U.S., if you are looking for entrepreneurial growth," said Mr. Ihrfeldt, who is 32. "Ten years ago, it was almost nonexistent here."
Spray is hardly alone. Boxman, based in Stockholm but now operating largely from Britain, has become one of Europe's biggest providers of music over the Internet. Boo.com a Stockholm start-up whose investors include Goldman, Sachs, is gearing up to sell sports clothing on the Web.
There are a number of signs that this new generation of companies, and a new generation of entrepreneurs, has changed some of Sweden's basic chemistry. The most notable indication is that the nation kept growing this year, even when important industries began to sputter.
Much like Germany, Sweden has traditionally relied on manufactured exports for most of its growth. And much as in Germany, exports were hurt badly after the Asian and Russian markets plunged in 1997 and 1998. Yet while the German economy slowed to a standstill, Sweden's accelerated.
"When we were doing our projections exactly one year ago, we were worried the country might even slip into a recession," recalled Bjorn Oras, chief executive of the Poolia temporary worker agency. "Instead, things kept right on surging."
Government forecasters were similarly surprised. Worried that a downturn would generate new budget problems, Prime Minister Persson rejected the idea of tax cuts as recently as March. But now, with the tax coffers overflowing, he is pushing modest tax cuts as well as spending increases for health care, pensions, job training and the universities.
"In March and April, we didn't think unemployment would decrease so much," said Bosse Ringholm, Sweden's Finance Minister. "We have a new situation now."
Ms. Wibble, the industry federation's chief economist, said the explanation lay in the expansion of new service companies. "Formerly, we saw a close correspondence between economic growth and what was happening in the manufacturing industries," she said. "Now what we see is that when industry slows down, as it did earlier this year, the private service sector is still surging ahead. That is something new."
Indeed, many of Sweden's biggest employers are still struggling. Ericsson has lost a big chunk of the cellular-phone market to Nokia of Finland, which is now the world's biggest maker of mobile phones. The Scandinavian airline S.A.S. is losing millions of dollars, partly because of cut-rate competition from Finnair.
At 6.1 percent, Sweden's jobless rate is about one-third lower than the average in European Union countries. The numbers overstate the successes somewhat, because Government job creation and training programs account for a further 3.5 percent of the work force.
Yet economists say that virtually all of the increase in new jobs in the last two years has come from business rather than government.
That is apparent at the Stockholm county employment office. The office's most recent analysis shows shortages in several dozen job categories and acute shortages in many others, including car mechanics, taxi drivers and nurses.
"The information technology branch is pulling all kinds of other professions along with it -- economists, accountants and even artists," said Per Lindberg, director of the office. "It's changing the whole structure of the labor market."
Still, many Swedes remain cautious about the future. Partly because of the strong social programs, Sweden's economy often swings from feast to famine.
When the economy is strong, government revenue rises much faster than expenses. But when conditions turn bad, the country is hit by a double punch of added social costs and shrinking capital investment.
Arvid Bohn, an economist at the Swedish Federation of Industry, has been through those big swings before. "The thing you have to remember about Sweden," he said, "is that there is no such thing as a soft landing here."

HEADLINE: How a Soldier Grew Into a Monster

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
Film, marshaled by the thousands upon thousands of frames, is the devastating witness that lays bare the homicidal, corrupt, vainglorious tyranny of Mobutu Sese Seko, the longtime dictator of Zaire, in the Belgian-made documentary ''Mobutu, King of Zaire.''
 The 2-hour-15-minute expose of the cold war ruler, who died at 66 in exile in Morocco in 1997, is remarkable not so much for its retelling of well-established history but for the mountain of visible detail that buttresses what is known about a man who rose from relative obscurity to seize power in a vast nation of some 40 million and hold it in his brutal grip for nearly a generation.
 The documentary -- directed by Thierry Michel and to be shown at 6 tonight as part of the 37th New York Film Festival -- rejects shrill indictment in favor of the cumulative revelation of its subject through film and the testimony of knowledgeable Mobutu aides and other qualified individuals. 
 Here, once more, is Joseph Mobutu the young soldier, Mobutu the young journalist, Mobutu the young private secretary to the African nationalist Patrice Lumumba at the negotiations in Brussels that led to the Congo's independence from Belgian colonialism in 1960.
 And here, too, is Mobutu betraying Prime Minister Lumumba, who appointed him secretary of state and commander of the armed forces; Mobutu ascending through military ranks, accumulating titles, donning his familiar leopard-skin hat, giving himself and his country a new name, Zaire, and imposing his tyranny.
 Though the narrative is not seamless, the film touches on the noteworthy events in Mobutu's ascent to the pinnacle of power beginning in 1965. It is a chronicle littered with assassinations, financial and sexual self-indulgence, economic miscalculation, gross corruption and canny diplomacy in the cold war years that earned Mobutu the favor and support of Western leaders in France and the United States.
 Well into the film, after Mobutu's treachery, murders and manipulations are well established, President George Bush is seen in a White House ceremony, expressing profuse admiration and friendship for the dictator beside him.
 Here as elsewhere, Thierry Michel's use of film makes his point. To say more would belabor the obvious.

MOBUTU, KING OF ZAIRE
Directed by Thierry Michel; commentary written (in French, with English subtitles) by Lye Mudaba and Mr. Michel; directors of photography, Alain Marcoen, Joel Marcipont and Didier Hill Derive; edited by Marine Deleu; produced by Christine Pireaux, Martine Barbe and Serge Lalou. Shown tonight at 6 at Alice Tully Hall as part of the 37th New York Film Festival. Running time: 135 minutes. This film is not rated.

Politics Threatens Brazilian Utility Sales

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
He's up to his old tricks again. With an eye to his political fortunes, the same maverick Governor and former President who provoked Brazil's currency crisis in January by defaulting on his state's foreign debt is now seeking to sabotage a crucial federal government program to privatize state-owned companies.
Heeding a call by Itamar Franco, the Governor of Minas Gerais state, the board of its electric utility agreed on Thursday to expel directors representing minority shareholders including two American companies, the AES Corporation and the Southern Company. In 1997, the companies acquired a one-third interest in the utility, known as Cemig, and have since invested nearly $1 billion under a contract that Mr. Franco, backed by a sympathetic state court, now refuses to recognize. 
 "We are completely shocked by the action taken by Minas Gerais," said Richard Owen, vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean for Southern, one of the biggest utilities in the United States. "This could reflect on the appetite foreign companies have in future privatizations."
Mr. Franco has also campaigned to block the privatization of Furnas Electrical, a utility that supplies power to nearly half of Brazil's 165 million people. Recently he went so far as to threaten to divert the course of the rivers that feed the giant Furnas dam, situated in his state, if the utility is sold.
In addition, Mr. Franco has dispatched state military police to conduct maneuvers in the area around the dam and has established a command base there. Though he has not explicitly threatened to use those forces to block private investors from taking control of Furnas, he has cited the crucial role of the military police in coups in 1932 and 1964.
To what extent the actions of Mr. Franco, who was elected Governor of Brazil's third-most populous state last year, are motivated by ideology, as opposed to personal grievances, is hard to determine. As President from 1992 through 1994, he ushered in a period of economic stability, but most of the credit went to Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was his Finance Minister and is now serving a second term as President.
One of Mr. Franco's first acts after taking office in January was to decree a moratorium on payment of his state's debts both to the central government and to foreign creditors, which set off a crisis that resulted in a 40 percent devaluation of the Brazilian currency.
Despite the criticism that earned him, Mr. Franco is said by political analysts still to harbor hopes of returning to the presidency when elections are held in 2002.
His chances are considered slim, however, since many Brazilians regard him as irresponsible and even clownish. Cartoonists and comedians habitually mock the pompadour hair style that is his trademark. They like to poke fun at his irascibility and penchant, at 67, for romantic pursuits of women half his age.
"Itamar came into office obsessed with screwing things up for Cardoso as much as he could," said David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the University of Brasilia and publisher of a widely read political newsletter. "He is totally vain, thinks he is going to be Brazil's savior, and is thoroughly convinced he can get the nomination."
After trying for several weeks to ignore Mr. Franco's latest challenge, the federal government finally fired back on Oct. 1. Asked at a luncheon of the Council of the Americas in New York about Mr. Franco's behavior, Arminio Fraga, head of Brazil's central bank, dismissed the former President as an eccentric whose actions were unjustly tarnishing the entire country's image.
"You shouldn't think that is Brazil," Mr. Fraga was quoted as saying in Brazilian news reports. "That is Minas. If you are minority investors, find another state and not Minas Gerais."
The political fallout has been both immediate and extensive. At the behest of the Governor's allies, Mr. Fraga this week was "invited" to explain his remarks to a congressional committee, and talks aimed at getting Minas Gerais to end its debt moratorium are said to have stalled.
Mr. Franco himself has sued Mr. Fraga in a state court, seeking damages for his remarks. He also has accused the central bank chief, who has an American mother, of being more loyal to the United States than Brazil.
While Mr. Franco's behavior is regarded with a certain bemusement here, it comes at a delicate moment. In a setback to the austerity program Mr. Cardoso pledged to carry out as part of a $41.5 billion rescue package signed with the International Monetary Fund last November, the Supreme Court ruled last week that two important taxes on civil servants were illegal.
Mr. Cardoso's economic team has been scrambling to find new sources of revenue to fill the gap left by that decision.
Mr. Fraga acknowledged in New York that "we are very annoyed" at what he called the former President's potentially damaging efforts to drive away private capital.
But Mr. Franco's defiant stance has also, as the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo noted in an editorial this week, "given him political vitality." In particular, he has scored points with nationalist and populist groups on the left.
"A people who do not control their own sources of energy have no autonomy," said Joao Pedro Stedile, leader of the Movement of the Landless, a peasant group. If Brazil were to completely privatize its electricity sector, he said, it would be "transformed into a gigantic, Portuguese-speaking Puerto Rico," so his group "is in total solidarity with Itamar."

HEADLINE: In China's Boom, Rural Poor Feel a Widening Gap

SERIES: A HALF-CENTURY IN CHINA: Yawning Gaps Between Rich and Poor

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: BALI, China

 BODY:
In a crumbling mud-brick house, nestled against the untidy heap that holds her family's entire wardrobe, Zheng Xingrong defines her life with a series of emphatic negatives.
How often do your children eat eggs or meat? "Never!" Do you have a radio or television? "No!" Is your 14-year-old daughter in school? "No!" Does your 8-year-old boy have any toys? "None!" 
 "Because we have no money, we don't dare to have any dreams," said the 40-year-old woman, whose family is one of the poorest in a destitute farming village north of the Yellow River in Shandong province.
Only three hours away by car, in Hongyuan village, near the city of Jinan, Li Huazhu, 45, and his wife Chen Xuerong, 39 -- farmers until a few years ago -- proudly show off the former gas station site they just bought with cash. It will house their expanding company, which makes precision-ground granite slabs to export for industrial use.
Their 17-year-old son has some very big toys -- a videodisk player and a motorbike -- and their 18-year-old daughter is in nursing school. Ms. Chen dreams of the day, not so distant, when they can buy a car and build their own two-story house. "No," her husband interjects, "a three-story house!"
Between one family's despair and another family's dreams lies a serious new problem for China, the rapid growth in economic disparities. In the booming 1990's, yawning gaps opened between city and countryside, between the developed coast and the isolated interior, between upper and lower classes in the cities and, as these two families illustrate, between richer and poorer villages.
No one knows the extent to which popular resentment of inequality may be a source of unrest in a country that is already struggling with slowed growth, high unemployment and bitterness over official corruption. But the trend itself is striking.
From comparative income equality in the mid-1980's, China in the last decade has suddenly emerged as one of the most unequal countries in Asia, surpassing countries like India and Indonesia, according to reports by the World Bank and others. China's disparities surpass those of the United States and Western Europe, though they do not approach the extremes of Latin America.
"Mounting inequality and its possible consequences, both for social and economic stability and for continued growth, have become central issues of policy debate and scholarly research," said Hu Angang, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wang Shaoguang, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, in their new book, "The Political Economy of Uneven Development: The Case of China" (M.E. Sharpe).
Still, public debate inside China about the growing disparities remains muted, in part because the official line remains that economic trailblazers will pull up everyone else and that the Government is fully addressing any problems.
Two decades ago, as China switched from Mao Zedong's failed socialism toward a more open, market-oriented economy, some rise in inequality was expected and even desired. The late Deng Xiaoping, mastermind of the reforms, famously said, "Let some prosper first so that others may follow."
The economic loosening produced blistering growth and, especially in the early years, widely shared improvements. The climb from penury for hundreds of millions of rural people through family farming and the spread of rural industry has been one of modern China's greatest feats.
But few anticipated the surging disparities of the 1990's, as the top urban and rural groups sped ahead. One study, by Dwayne Benjamin and Loren Brandt of the University of Toronto, found rural inequality as great as in the feudal 1930's, although at higher levels for all.
Today, these scholars found, it is access to nonfarm jobs in rural and township industries or the cities, rather than grossly skewed land-holdings, that has allowed some to forge ahead. Rural areas nearest to cities -- like Hongyuan village, outside Shandong's capital, Jinan -- have done especially well.
Overall, though, rural economic growth has fallen far behind that of the cities -- and is likely to keep sputtering without major changes in policy, economists say, because agriculture is in a rut and many rural industries are in trouble.
Worse, there is evidence that progress against the worst poverty slowed during a period of fantastic national growth. Since the late 80's the reduction of rural poverty "was far less than it would have been had the growth in rural income inequality been avoided." conclude Carl Riskin of Columbia University and Azizur R. Khan of the University of California in a study being published by Oxford University Press.
Still trapped at rock-bottom today are some 124 million Chinese, living below the World Bank's poverty standard of one dollar a day in per capita income. According to the Government's more stringent definition, there are 42 million Chinese below the poverty line. Whatever the definition, China's poorest people are concentrated in crowded, eroded mountain lands in the south and the north and in pockets elsewhere, like the region of poor soils and little industry around Bali.
Now, too, an urban underclass is emerging for the first time in recent history, mainly unemployed workers and elderly people with minimal pensions and no prosperous relatives to help out.
The Government has special policies to aid the poor and reduce inequality, including small welfare payments for destitute city dwellers, rural anti-poverty projects and incentives for investment in inland provinces.
But harming the rural areas in particular are two policies that seem unlikely to be reversed any time soon: the tight controls on the ability of villagers to move to cities and compete for jobs, and a national policy of self-sufficiency in grain, under which farmers are forced to grow grains when they often could make far more growing fruits and vegetables.
Bali, a village of 300 families and 1,300 people, is in a county that authorities only last year declared to have been lifted above the official Government poverty line, set at a per-person income of about $220 a year.
A large group of residents, gathered in front of Ms. Zheng's home, laughed on hearing about that official milestone. "An entire family here doesn't earn $220," one man said, and that includes money brought home by migrant workers.
In all the village, just three people have bought motor scooters and about 70 percent of families have small black-and-white televisions. The mud and straw homes have floors of packed earth.
It may be that perhaps the farmers do not fully calculate the value of their subsistence crops, but other signs point to an insecure, nearly hand-to-mouth existence. Each family has less than an acre of land to farm, and the soils, cropped with wheat and then corn every year, are salty and low-yielding.
Each year every family must hand over 100 kilograms -- about 220 pounds -- of grain, close to half their produce, to the local government, residents said, in payment of obligations they are not sure about. For most families, the remaining grain provides just enough to eat through the year, with some of the wheat traded for a paste made from freshwater shrimp. There is rarely any surplus left to sell.
Families owe another $15 in various fees each year, residents said, and must also pay other fees for every child in school.
The only thing that keeps families here going is the money earned by men who spend a few months each summer -- leaving when the corn is knee-high and returning at harvest time -- working in highway construction around the city of Tianjin or along Shandong's prosperous coast. There, they can save about $60 each month.
One reason why Ms. Zheng's family is especially bad off is that her husband has asthma and has not been able to earn much in distant labor. He does not go to the clinic, she said, "unless he has really serious trouble breathing," because it costs $5 a visit.
The family keeps six chickens and a pig in the front yard, but all eggs and meat must be sold, and day after day they eat either bread and shrimp paste or boiled turnips.
Ms. Zheng's brother-in-law, 34-year-old Luo Huicheng, thought he had a way to break through last year when he saw low prices for feed grains and good prices for pork. Encouraged by county agricultural agents, in July of 1998 he borrowed $2,100 to build concrete sties and buy 30 pigs.
Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of other farmers around China had the same idea and in a classic cycle, overproduction caused pork prices to plummet. In front of his empty sty, Mr. Luo described his feelings earlier this year, as he watched prices fall below his costs, and then fall more.
"I felt so helpless," he recalled. "I'd built the sty. I'd bought the pigs. I just wished they would hurry up and grow!" He sold the pigs for $600, and worked at construction jobs to start repaying his loan.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Jumps 112.71 on Bargain Hunting

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher yesterday as bargain hunters loaded up on a handful of blue chips, reversing an early selloff that had been triggered by the release of a mixed jobs report for September.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 112.71 points, or 1.07 percent, to 10,649.76. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.38 points, or 1.39 percent, to 1,336.02. The Nasdaq composite index was up 25.87 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 2,886.57. 
 "We have got certain sectors, namely health care and retail, that are leading the market," said Dan Ascani, president and research director at Global Market Strategists Inc. in Gainesville, Ga.
The Labor Department reported a weaker-than-expected labor market for September, but the numbers were distorted by the economic disruptions caused by Hurricane Floyd. The report also signaled that wages are rising at a faster-than-expected clip.
The average hourly wages shot up 7 cents, to $13.37, the biggest one-month gain since an 8-cent rise in September 1983. The nonfarm payrolls in September shed 8,000 workers, the first drop in more than three years and far below the expectations for a gain of 230,000 new jobs.
The increase in wages heightened expectations the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates at its next policy-setting meeting in November.
"Although some of the numbers looked very negative on the surface, because of the hurricane situation, the market decided the numbers do not really mean all that much," said Ron Doran, director of institutional trading at C. L. King & Associates in Albany. "The biggest issue is concern about where interest rates are going."
An increase in interest rates is generally seen as negative for stocks because it can raise borrowing costs for companies and slow consumer purchases.
Analysts said stability in the bond market also gave investors confidence to buy stocks.
"The bond market is steady right now and there is a lot of money flowing into the market," said Arnie Owen, managing director of capital markets at Cruttenden Roth.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 99 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.19 percent from 6.18 percent on Thursday.
Analysts said retail and health care stocks largely led the advance.
The Standard & Poor's retail index rose 37.79 point, or 4.3 percent, to 908.48, beating the overall market's performance, a day after retailers reported strong store sales.
Wal-Mart Stores was up 4 1/16, to 55 3/8, and Federated Department Stores, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, gained 2 3/8, to 46.
Analysts said drug stocks got a lift from passage by the House of a proposed patients' rights bill, which some said could possibly lead to more drug sales.
The Standard & Poor's drug index ended up 14.65 points, or 3.9 percent, at 382.12. The drug giant Merck gained 2 7/8, to 73 3/4, while Johnson & Johnson rose 4 1/2, to 98 3/4.

HEADLINE: Famed Cuban Band Is Set to Perform in Miami, and the Overtone Is One of Strain

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 8

 BODY:
In presenting the Cuban singer-songwriter Carlos Varela to a group of listeners in Miami Beach last year, Maria Romeu said she had bouts of panic during which she worried about his safety. One of the first artists from Cuba to perform in hostile exile territory, Mr. Varela tested the waters by singing then for select, word-of-mouth-only audiences.
"Small venues, out-of-the-way obscure locations, no advertising," said Ms. Romeu, who has a marketing company here and promoted those appearances. "That's not exactly how a promoter generates revenues." 
 But Mr. Varela was a hit, and after he appeared here, more than a dozen Cuban solo artists and bands trickled in to play more openly to bigger crowds and dwindling groups of protesters, prompting the occasional bomb threat -- and in at least one instance a Molotov cocktail thrown at a club's front door -- but no major controversy. Headliners like Issac Delgado, NG La Banda, Chucho Valdes and Francisco Repilado, the guitarist from the "Buena Vista Social Club" documentary who is better known as Compay Segundo, helped usher in what seemed like a new era of tolerance in an area where bombings, assaults on concertgoers and public scorn had dissuaded many Cuban performers from visiting.
Now, however, hostilities are at a peak once again with the announcement that Los Van Van, Cuba's most popular dance band, which has performed all over the United States but never in Miami, is coming to town. The band is to play the Miami Arena on Saturday night, in what promises to be a test for both freedom of expression in this city and the shifting views within Cuban Miami, which, after successive waves of immigration, encompasses people who vary in social class, race, generation, politics and, indeed, musical taste.
Los Van Van, arriving here for the next-to-last stop of a 28-city tour of the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, have stirred up passions partly because they are booked in a venue of 8,000 seats, which would allow by far the biggest audience yet for Cuban artists here. In addition, the concert is set within Miami, the seat of power for conservative Cuban exiles, rather than the more liberal Miami Beach, where Cuban artists performing in the area have almost always appeared.
Finally, the band itself is a 30-year-old institution regarded as Cuba's foremost cultural ambassador, which to detractors means Fidel Castro's handpicked proxy. Even the name Van Van, derived from a revolutionary slogan, grates on critics.
Plans for the concert first prompted Miami city officials to impose requirements on the local promoter that led to a change of date twice and the move of the event from one city-owned center to another. The promoter, Debbie Ohanian, who said only city-owned arenas were large enough to meet the expected demand for tickets, sought help from the American Civil Liberties Union, which threatened to sue if Los Van Van were in any way prevented from performing.
Now that the band has cleared bureaucratic hurdles, exile organizations are planning a large protest outside the Miami Arena on Saturday night. Some callers to Spanish-language radio stations have even vowed to videotape concertgoers as they enter the arena so that the city's "Communists" can be identified.
"This is the last straw," Juan Perez Franco, president of Brigade 2506, a group of Bay of Pigs veterans that is organizing the protest, said of the concert. "This is a provocation to exiles and an insult to the memory of our martyrs."
But while older exiles shun Los Van Van as political envoys, a growing population of more recent arrivals from Cuba, and many young Cuban-Americans, welcome them as cultural envoys who help satisfy yearnings for the homeland or for a connection with Cuban heritage.
A Miami Herald poll of Miamians last month confirmed a sharp generational split on the issue among Hispanic respondents: those older than 50 opposed performances by musical groups from Cuba in city-owned centers, 65 percent to 24 percent, while those under 50 supported such shows by 50 percent to 31 percent.
Los Van Van themselves say that denunciation by conservatives here kept them from trying to perform in Miami earlier but that, on visits to family and friends, they have found an increasingly welcome climate.
"These are different times," Cesar Pedroso, the band's pianist and co-founder, said in a telephone interview. "Everything changes. This concert will be an encounter with fans of many years who have not seen us since they left Cuba, and with the generations who don't know Los Van Van personally."
Among the children of exiles supporting the band is the 42-year-old Ms. Romeu, who was brought to the United States as a child, was reared in Chicago and became one of a handful of promoters who have created the Cuban music scene here.
"It's not about Cuba or Los Van Van," Ms. Romeu insisted. "It's about a glorious music tradition. We talk about the First Amendment and the extreme Cuban right wing, and nobody is talking about the music."
Ms. Romeu's fervor for Cuban culture got her fired once, after a leading Cuban exile group complained in 1994 to her employer, the Spanish-language network of MTV, that she was using her office there to help organize a private tour to Havana for a concert by Mr. Varela. The network, MTV Latino, where Ms. Romeu was an assistant to the managing director, said at the time that she had been dismissed for using company resources for a personal matter.
But Ms. Romeu, who has helped promote and produce Cuban artists' performances around the United States since the late 1970's, says she has no regrets. "That was the beginning of a beautiful thing," she said of her early support for Mr. Varela, whose Miami Beach shows last year she describes as "unbelievable."
"It was 250 sobbing people who knew every word of the songs," she said. "Nobody said, 'I hate you because you left.' Nobody said, 'I hate you because you're still there.' There was unconditional reconciliation, and that is the single most important thing that can happen to our culture."
Other Cuban-Americans, including some younger ones, say that even culture must be governed by the rule of law, in this case the United States' economic embargo of Cuba. Miami's 44-year-old Cuban-born Mayor, Joe Carollo, said in an interview that he personally opposed Los Van Van as "Castro's premier band" but that in any event the city's interest in the concert was that there be compliance with the embargo, which requires financial restrictions on any cultural exchanges with Cuba.
To that end, city officials demanded that the concert's promoter produce documentation from the United States Treasury Department certifying that none of the money generated by the concert would go to the Government of Cuba. That documentation was obtained.
The promoter, Ms. Ohanian, a Miami Beach nightclub owner who has presented half a dozen Cuban artists over the last year without incident, has been called a "Castro agent" on Spanish-language radio stations here and picketed by small groups of protesters who have shown up outside her club. But in addition to the concert by Los Van Van, she is planning to present Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez, two stars from the Grammy-winning "Buena Vista Social Club" album, at the Jackie Gleason Theater in Miami Beach in February.
"Somebody has to be the voice of the people who are tired of all this,' she said of the protests against Cuban performers.
As for Ms. Romeu, she said she was ready to bring Mr. Varela back for a concert tour next year. "I'm really committed to disseminating this art," she said. "Why can't I have a right to it? We grow up hearing, 'Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.' How can we not want to hear Cuban music?"

HEADLINE: Clinton Visit Shows Warmth of Canadian Ties

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Today, for the first time, an American President traveled to a foreign nation and inaugurated an American Embassy. President Clinton broke historical protocol in Canada, a quiet partner that trades more with the United States than any other country.
The relaxed outdoor ceremony, with Parliament's landmark Victorian bell tower mirrored in the glass-and-steel face of the new embassy, seemed to reflect the easy relations between the two neighbors. 
 In the 10 years since a trade pact was signed, trade between the United States and Canada has doubled. It now runs more than $1 billion a day.
In the 1990's, Canada has firmly established itself as the largest source of imported energy for the United States and the most popular foreign destination for American tourists.
In a joking mood on a sunny morning, Mr. Clinton cracked that Jean Chretien, the 65-year-old Prime Minister, was the only Western leader "who could still slalom on water skis with one of his grandchildren on his shoulders." Noting that this was his fifth visit to Canada as President, Mr. Clinton continued kidding, saying, "He also says if I come one more time, I have to start paying taxes."
The laughter faded at the end of the speech, when Mr. Clinton appeared to stray beyond his text, talking about ethnic strife "in the land of my forebears in Northern Ireland."
"Every time they make an agreement to do it, they're like a couple of drunks walking out of the bar for the last time," he said of the on-again, off-again peace process between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. "When they get to the swinging door, they turn around and go back in and say, 'I just can't quite get there.' " He later said the metaphor was inappropriate, and expressed "regret for any offense my remarks caused."
The sparks around the joke provided news for reporters hard pressed to find controversy in a relationship that Americans take for granted -- the world's largest trading relationship crossing the world's longest undefended border. This cross-border commerce is expected to reach $410 billion this year.
"Less than 1 percent of our trade is subject to trade action," said Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, a career diplomat who is also a nephew of the Prime Minister. "This huge trade goes so smoothly that it is unnoticed."
Indeed, with this quiet, north-south boom, the United States exports more to Canada than to all Western Europe. More goods cross between Ontario and the United States than are exchanged between the United States and Japan.
"We do more trade through Windsor and Detroit than the U.S. does with Japan," Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said.
Prime Minister Chretien was elected in 1993 on a platform of skepticism about increasing economic integration with the United States. Instead, he has presided over the fastest integration in his country's history.
"Trade between the U.S. and Canada has doubled in 10 years," the American ambassador here, Gordon D. Giffin, said in an interview. "That is quite impressive when you think that we have been doing business for more than 200 years."
In the last 10 years, world trade has increased 50 percent.
The Canadian trading expansion has radically opened a country that once reveled in its northern isolation. Since an automobile pact was signed with the United States in 1965, the sector of the Canadian economy tied to foreign trade has tripled, rising to 42 percent. Measuring economic dependence on foreign trade, Canada has climbed in the Group of Seven industrial countries to second place, after Germany.
For much of its history, Canada has strived to create a cohesion between its east and west. But each of the 10 provinces now trades more with the United States than with the rest of Canada. In July, 87 percent of Canada's exports went to the United States.
"You are seeing the Americanization of Canada, no doubt about it," said Peter S. Bleyer, executive director of the Council of Canadians, a grass-roots nationalist group here. "Canada is dramatically more integrated, that is, dramatically more dependent on the U.S. than we were a decade ago."
In the five years since Wal-Mart opened its first Canadian store, the American chain has become the Canada's largest retailer. Noting this march of American franchises across the landscape, Mr. Bleyer said, "We are becoming more and more made in the image of our elephant neighbor to the south."
Against the wishes of economic nationalists, Canada's speeding economic links with the United States are eroding support for sovereignty icons like border posts and currency.
In the spring in a poll of 1,204 adults, 52 percent said that they were optimistic about globalization, and 39 percent said that border posts between Canada and the United States should be torn down, allowing trade and traffic to flow freely in both directions. In the poll, conducted by Ekos Research Associates, 17 percent were pessimistic on the economic effects of integration.
In the summer in a poll of 1,500 Canadians, half the respondents predicted that the United States and Canada would have a common currency in 10 years, and 77 percent said in 20 years. In the poll, conducted by the Angus Reid Group Inc., 37 percent said abolition of the Canadian dollar would be good for Canada's economy. Over the last five years, the Canadian dollar has lost 12 percent of its value, a contraction popular with exporters but frustrating to Canadian travelers.
Canada's openness is reciprocated. Last year, Americans made almost 15 million overnight visits here. Last year, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations commissioned a survey of 1,507 American adults for a "feelings thermometer" about 25 countries. Respondents had the warmest feelings for Canada, 72 degrees, followed by Britain, 69, and Italy, 62. Ranking in the mid-50's were Mexico, Germany, Brazil, Japan, Israel, France and South Africa.
Banking on the good feelings, academic specialists on United States-Canada relations speculate that the next step in integration could be a customs union, a European-style relationship with common external tariffs and free internal movement of goods and people.
Politicians and diplomats tend to be more cautious on forecasting North American economic relations.
"That dialogue is mostly in the press and among academics," Mr. Giffin said, referring to talk of a North American currency. "I don't see it much among policy makers in the U.S. or Canada."
Today "an agreement in principle" was announced over exchange of military and aerospace technology. In a move that threatened Canada's $6 billion-a-year military industry, the United States threatened in April to impose a licensing system on military exports to the Canada if Canada did not tighten its controls. Today, Canada promised to tighten its export controls, creating, with the United States, "a strong North American perimeter for defense export controls."

HEADLINE: Job Growth Falters in Possible Sign That Economy Is Starting to Slow

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The energetic American economy may be slipping into a slower gear, as job creation came to a halt last month and the work force shrank for the first time since January 1996. But wages continued to rise at a healthy pace, the Labor Department reported yesterday, keeping alive the potential for future inflation.
Hurricane Floyd, disrupting East Coast commerce in mid-September, discouraged many employers from hiring. "But employment growth was weak even in those industries unaffected by the hurricane," Katherine Abraham, commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said in a message to Congress. 
 Taking August and September together, only 95,000 new jobs were created: 103,000 in August and a loss of 8,000 in September. That is a rather startling pullback from the 654,000 new jobs that appeared in June and July -- and hardly justification for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting, on Nov. 16, to contain inflation by slowing the economy. When it met last Tuesday, the Fed policy makers left rates unchanged.
"The American economy is slowing; the key question is how much," said Nancy Lazar, a vice president at ISI Group, taking a more pessimistic view of the employment report than some other Wall Street economists, who said more data were needed before a trend could be identified.
While the Labor Department's monthly survey of American companies disclosed the weak job growth, a separate survey of households showed that the unemployment rate in September had remained unchanged, at an unusually low 4.2 percent.
Bond market traders, uncertain whether to view the employment report as a harbinger or an anomaly, left interest rates unchanged. The stock market initially saw in the numbers evidence that the Fed was unlikely to raise interest rates in November. In response, the Dow Jones Industrial average rose at the opening. Then it fell, but finally finished up 112.71 points at 10,649.76.
"This number, which was expected to be a defining number for the markets, only creates more confusion," Joel L. Naroff, an economic consultant, advised his clients in an E-mail.
The one aspect of the employment report that raised warning flags was the wage number. Average hourly wages for production workers below the rank of supervisor rose by 7 cents, to $13.37. The 7 cents represented the biggest one-month jump in more than a decade. But that was the only superlative. The percentage increase -- five-tenths of a percent -- was no greater than some earlier months this year. And the 3.8 percent wage rise over the last 12 months is roughly what wage growth for production workers has been all year: firm but not yet firm enough to push employers into inflationary price increases.
"The only thing that would make the wage growth potentially inflationary -- and this is a big if -- is if productivity were to slow from its present strong growth rate," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard University labor economist. A rising productivity rate has meant that workers have produced more each hour on the job. The added revenue from their output has paid in effect for their wage increases.
What Ms. Lazar saw in the employment report was evidence that rising interest rates in recent months, as well as a flat stock market, rising oil prices and a sharp drop in the number of households refinancing mortgages are beginning to take their toll on the real economy. But the September employment report is the first significant evidence of that toll. Elsewhere in the economy, retail sales were strong in September, and so were industrial production, home sales, consumer borrowing and auto sales.
"Certainly in 2000 we expect the economy to slow," said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "But except for this report there is no other sign of slowing now."
Taking an unusual step, the Labor Department estimated how many additional jobs would have been counted if Hurricane Floyd had not struck just in the week of the department's employment survey. The goal was to head off speculation that September would have been a strong employment month if not for Floyd. Without the hurricane, job growth would have been only 50,000.
"Including that 50,000, you can say that employment growth in the third quarter was 175,000 a month compared with 210,000 a month in the first half of the year," said Thomas Nardone, an official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "That is still slower growth."
Jobs disappeared in manufacturing, retailing, mortgage banking and government. Employment remained unchanged in finance, insurance and real estate. Jobs in the huge service sector -- office workers, for example, and call center operators -- multiplied, as usual, but only by 39,000, less than half the average monthly growth of the last year. Trucking, the airline industry, construction and public utilities also added jobs. Between the gains and the losses, the total number of jobs in the nation declined in September to 128.91 million.
While industrial production rose last month, manufacturing employment fell once again, this time by 21,000 jobs. Over the last 18 months, manufacturing employment has shrunk by 532,000 jobs, to 18.4 million. To keep production up with fewer workers, companies have resorted to labor-saving technology and equipment, as well as overtime for the remaining people.
Overtime hours averaged a relatively high 4.7 a week in September, unchanged from August. But other industries cut back hours, and the net result for the private sector as a whole was a slight decline in the average workweek, to 34.4 hours from 34.5 in August.
The overtime in manufacturing helps to explain the steady rise in average hourly wages for production workers. Many of the people displaced from these jobs, on the other hand, have probably moved into lower-paying service jobs, economists say, helping to damp wage growth.
In its monthly wage calculations, the Labor Department counts only production workers, mainly in manufacturing, and not the wages of nonproduction service workers. Nor does it include bonus payments, which have been widespread across the labor force, but are easier than wages to scale back when business declines.
Viewing labor costs more broadly, Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers, noted that total compensation per hour -- wages and benefits -- grew by 5.1 percent in the second quarter. "Our forecast," he said, "is that compensation will rise by more than 4.5 percent in the third quarter, still high but not as high."

S.& P. 500 Gains 18 Points On Bargain Hunting Spree
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.38 points, or 1.39 percent, to 1,336.02, in reaction to a buying spree by bargain hunters. The market was also responding to the mixed jobless report for September. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2 percent last month, but the report signaled that wages are rising at a faster-than-expected clip. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 112.71 points, or 1.07 percent, to 10,649.76. The Nasdaq composite index increased 25.87 points, to 2,886.57. Page C3.
 
A Limit for Computer Technology?
A researcher at Intel contends in the journal Science that computer technology is reaching a limit as to how small silicon chips can become. The limit would end a phenomenon known as Moore's law, which says that every 18 months, the number of transistors that will fit on a silicon chip doubles. A1.
 
F.C.C. Loosens Rules for Cable
The Federal Communications Commission has substantially loosened the rules that have limited one company from controlling too much of the cable industry. The decision clears the way for AT&T to own more than a third of the nation's franchises offering subscribers television, telephone and high-speed Internet services as well as own major interests in a number of major video producers and television programmers.

State Farm Must Pay Damages
A state judge in Illinois has decided that State Farm defrauded policyholders by requiring that damages from auto accidents be repaired with lower-priced generic parts, and ordered the insurer to pay $730 million in actual and punitive damages. Earlier in the week a jury said the insurer breached its contracts with policyholders by having repair shops use parts that were not authorized by auto manufacturers. The new verdict brought the total damages from the case to $1.19 billion. A10.
 
Roche to Cut Stake in Genentech
Genentech said Roche Holdings would reduce its stake in the company to 65 percent from 82 percent by selling 20 million shares. Investors sold on the news, driving Genentech's stock down $15.0625, to $157.75. C2.

I.B.M. Set to Cut About 1,000 Jobs
I.B.M. plans to cut up to 10 percent of its personal computer work force, or up to 1,000 workers, in a cost-cutting effort to turn around the division, which lost nearly $1 billion last year. The 5 percent to 10 percent reduction in the work force of 10,000 will mostly affect marketing employees as the company consolidates its staff for different brands. C3.

HEADLINE: Labor, Revitalized With New Recruiting, Has Regained Power and Prestige

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
When John J. Sweeney took the helm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. four years ago, the labor movement was spiraling downward. It was steadily losing membership, politicians had dismissed it as a toothless has-been and much of the public viewed it as an irrelevant dinosaur.
Four years later, on the eve of the labor federation's convention in Los Angeles, things have turned around. 
 Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley are tripping over each other to win the A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsement in next year's Presidential election. Lawmakers are being attentive once again as unions play a heavyweight role in Congress, pushing for a patients' bill of rights and a higher minimum wage.
Workers at DaimlerChrysler and the Boeing Company have hit grand slams in their latest contracts by negotiating hefty raises, and union organizers have pulled off their biggest victory in six decades, adding 74,000 health-care workers in Los Angeles in one swoop.
Inspired by Mr. Sweeney's preaching about the need to reverse labor's slide -- membership peaked at 21 million in 1979 before falling to a low of 16 million in 1997 -- unions expect to organize more than 500,000 new members this year, more than five times the number the year Mr. Sweeney took office.
Suddenly, labor seems to have so much cachet that doctors, psychologists, graduate teaching assistants, limousine drivers and even fashion models are rushing to join.
"Sweeney has dramatically increased labor's visibility," said Robert B. Reich, a former Secretary of Labor. "He's turned the A.F.L.-C.I.O. into a more formidable political force. I haven't met anyone who doesn't believe John Sweeney has been terrific for organized labor. But having said that, the obstacles for labor are still very large."
American unions are still in many ways swimming against the tide.
Globalization has hindered union efforts to raise wages as companies have continued to close unionized factories and have moved the work overseas. The nation's recent explosion in jobs has been concentrated in small business and high technology, areas where unions have made little headway.
Businesses have also been far more aggressive in battling unionization drives, while the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have routinely proposed legislation that is considered anti-union.
In addition, repeated reports of corruption seem to turn labor's progress into two steps forward and one step back.
Four years ago, many officials acknowledged that unions would have little power if the decline in membership was not reversed. The reason: if only 15 percent of an industry was organized, unionized companies could argue that they would not be able to compete with nonunion companies if they were too generous at the bargaining table.
Today, unions represent 13.9 percent of the work force in the United States, down sharply from 35 percent in the 1950's. Many economists say labor's declining power has been a major reason wages for most Americans have climbed slower than inflation since 1979.
Mr. Sweeney won the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s presidency after he and several other union presidents joined to push out his predecessor, Lane Kirkland. They complained that Mr. Kirkland, who died last August, seemed to pay more attention to helping workers in Poland than in the United States.
From day one, Mr. Sweeney's goal has been to reverse the decline in membership and power -- and he has realized that to do so he must rejuvenate labor's oh-so-boring image and form alliances across society.
One of his successes has been Union Summer, a program in which more than 1,000 college students have worked as summer interns, persuading many of them that helping workers was a cause worth devoting their lives to. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has also set up a program called "Street Heat" where union activists in more than a dozen cities will quickly mobilize to hold raucous demonstrations during disputes.
In addition, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is planning to make computers and Internet service available at discounted prices to the federation's 13 million members in an effort to bring workers closer together and to make them easier to mobilize. With the push of a button, a union president could E-mail thousands of members and urge them to E-mail state or Federal officials.
Today in Los Angeles, the labor federation is kicking off a campaign with immigrant groups as part of an effort to focus on the needs of immigrants. Union leaders said they want to attract more immigrants and help improve the lives of workers in low-paying jobs like janitors, hotel maids and farmhands.
Mr. Sweeney deliberately increased the movement's focus on low-paid workers after the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which includes 68 unions, was perceived as being preoccupied with labor's well-paid elite in auto plants and steel mills.
By focusing on low-paid workers, Mr. Sweeney has improved the movement's moral stature, causing hundreds of academics and members of the clergy to support labor in a way not seen in decades.
Even some of his most vocal opponents give Mr. Sweeney credit.
"Ever since Lane Kirkland passed away this summer, we heard how his work in fighting Communism around the world is what he will be remembered for," said Jeffrey McGuinness, president of LPA, a Washington-based management association that represents 250 companies. "John Sweeney will be remembered for reinvigorating the labor movement and getting back to basics. His job is to make the labor movement grow again, and he is moving aggressively in that direction.
Probably the biggest change wrought by Mr. Sweeney was to get the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and its member unions to focus on recruiting -- the key to the movement's survival.
Four years ago, unions on average spent less than 3 percent of their budget on organizing, but Mr. Sweeney has persuaded many unions to raise that to 10 percent. The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union now spends more than 30 percent of its budget on organizing, while the union Mr. Sweeney once headed, the Service Employees International Union, spends 45 percent on organizing.
That seems to be paying off. The service employees' union, which has more than 400 full-time organizers, expects to add almost 200,000 members this year, to 1.3 million.
Every few weeks, Mr. Sweeney has issued news releases boasting of another organizing win. After nearly a century, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees recently organized 5,200 workers at six Fieldcrest Cannon plants in Kannapolis, N.C. -- the heart of anti-union country.
With Puerto Rico recently giving its Government workers the right to join unions, about 66,000 public employees there are expected to vote to unionize this year.
These developments make A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials optimistic that for the first time in decades, unions might be able to reverse the decline in the percentage of workers belonging to a union. To achieve that goal, unions need to organize at least 500,000 additional workers.
Some A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials said they hope to soon unionize one million additional workers each year, but many labor experts say that might be optimistic. The booming high-tech sector has resisted organizing efforts, and unions still continue to lose nearly half of unionization elections.
"The first step to revitalizing the labor movement is stop the shrinking, and I believe that's happened." said Richard Hurd, a Cornell University professor of labor relations. "Does this translate into a revitalized labor movement that's on a permanent upward track? The answer to that, is it's still premature to say."

HEADLINE: In Giuliani's City Hall Strategy, Senate Race Rolls Quietly Along

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
For months, Rudolph W. Giuliani has said that the best way to run for United States Senate is to be a good Mayor, without distractions from a campaign apparatus. But in the weeks since Labor Day, Mr. Giuliani's unannounced race against Hillary Rodham Clinton has entered a new stage, as City Hall and the Mayor's closest aides quietly build the foundation of an aggressive, very Republican campaign.
Peter Powers, the friend of four decades who ran Mr. Giuliani's three campaigns for mayor, is once again playing the central role as Mr. Giuliani's chief political adviser. Other key figures, many of them veterans of the Mayor's campaigns, have already begun the political trench work, from filming footage for future commercials to sizing up Mrs. Clinton's stump style. 
 At the same time, Mr. Giuliani's Senate exploratory committee is continuing to raise the $15 million to $20 million he needs for the race, although as his expected Senate announcement date of early 2000 draws closer, several aides have privately expressed concern about the pace of his fund-raising.
"He doesn't realize the juggernaut that's about to hit him," said one adviser, referring to the First Lady's all-but-certain Senate campaign. "This is not Ruth Messinger. This is not David Dinkins." Mr. Giuliani trounced Ms. Messinger in the 1997 mayoral race and defeated Mr. Dinkins, the incumbent, in 1993.
This adviser, like nearly everyone interviewed for this article, requested anonymity, because the Mayor has told his aides not to talk about the campaign.
One adviser complained that it was like "pulling teeth" to get the Mayor to attend fund-raisers outside the city, and that it was impossible to raise $20 million in the city alone. But aides still say they are confident that Mr. Giuliani can raise $7 million by the end of the year. They also say, in part with the defensive intention of lowering expectations, that they know that Mrs. Clinton will raise as much as $25 million in all, and $10 million by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, Mr. Giuliani -- the man who endorsed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the soul of the liberal establishment, for re-election in 1994, and then barely endorsed Bob Dole for President in 1996 -- has begun to cloak himself in what aides are suddenly calling his "core philosophy" of Republicanism as he seeks his party's votes in the suburbs and upstate. In past years, Mr. Giuliani has allied himself not only with Mr. Cuomo but also the Liberal Party to win as Mayor in an overwhelmingly Democratic city.
In a speech last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., given in honor of the former President, Mr. Giuliani called the man he served as associate attorney general "a force for good in the world," and concluded, "Let us be thankful that he was born, and that the human family can reap the countless benefits that his life has brought us."
Although Mr. Giuliani still needs Democratic votes to win in a Democratic state, his aides point out that Reagan carried New York in 1980 and 1984, and that Mr. Giuliani still embraces typically Democratic issues like gun control and choice in abortion. "He's running as a George Pataki Republican," an adviser said. "That's a pretty smart thing to do."
The Mayor and the Republican Governor have feuded for years, but the two recently reached a truce. The public end to their quarrel seems to be driven, at least on Mr. Giuliani's part, by his need to have the Governor on his side in the Senate campaign. This week the new alliance was on extravagant display, as Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki nearly fell over each other with praise during a three-day Presidential campaign trip to New York by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
On Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani eagerly took Mr. Bush on a tour of the city he says he has revived, and he used the opportunity to cite his welfare-to-work program as an example of "compassionate conservatism," Mr. Bush's credo.
Although the official position at City Hall is that there is no campaign yet, Mr. Giuliani's political ambitions spill over into nearly every aspect of city government. "There is nothing we do here that doesn't have a political impact," said Joseph J. Lhota, the Deputy Mayor for operations, who runs the city while Mr. Giuliani is away on political trips.
Mr. Lhota, like all other advisers at City Hall, said Mr. Giuliani's fierce assault on the Brooklyn Museum of Art for an exhibition that the Mayor has declared offensive and anti-Catholic was not politically motivated, but came from his true beliefs. But several advisers nonetheless said they thought that Mr. Giuliani's position could help him with upstate voters who are distrustful of what they consider the sinful city.
Other aides, while insisting that the campaign has not yet begun, are thinking ahead in strategic detail. "It seems to me that the challenge is to identify where outside the city you're going to get out the vote," one adviser said this week. "We lost in 1989 because we didn't get out the vote. So who out there in the Republican Party really brings his county out? Who talks about getting his county out, and then doesn't do it? Where do you have to fill in with your own people?"
At the moment, there are no campaign meetings at City Hall, not least because city laws prohibit Mr. Giuliani's senior appointed officials from raising money and also restrict their political activity on the job.
Advisers say the election does not come up at the Mayor's 8 A.M. staff meeting, or at a much smaller 9 A.M. meeting in the Mayor's office. But Mr. Giuliani's inner circle regularly gets together with cigars late in the evening on the porch of Gracie Mansion, overlooking the East River, and discusses the campaign there, or in the mansion's library when the weather is bad.
Some of the key roles are already taking shape. Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for economic development, is in charge of the Mayor's relationships with upstate and national Republicans. Adam Goodman, Mr. Giuliani's media strategist in the 1997 mayoral campaign, is in far more frequent contact with the Mayor, and oversaw the filming, for future campaign commercials, of a speech that Mr. Giuliani gave last week at the Reagan Presidential Library.
Mr. Goodman's former partner, Rick Wilson, has replaced Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's former Director of Communications, as City Hall liaison to the impending campaign.
Frank Luntz, Mr. Giuliani's pollster, traveled with him on a political trip earlier last week to Nevada and California, and has been surreptitiously assessing the competition by attending Mrs. Clinton's speeches in Washington and New York.
David Garth, the volatile political consultant who has had a tumultuous history with Mr. Guiliani, could return as well. "No decisions have been made," said one close adviser, "but I wouldn't rule him out."
First among equals in the inner circle is Mr. Powers, Mr. Giuliani's former First Deputy Mayor, who is now a business consultant renting space in the offices of Howard J. Rubenstein, the omnipresent public relations executive who is close to Mr. Giuliani. Although Mr. Powers's role in the Senate campaign is undecided, advisers say he is operating now as the unofficial campaign chairman. Among others in the inner circle are Mr. Levine; Mr. Lhota; Bruce Teitelbaum, the head of the Mayor's exploratory committee, and Raymond B. Harding, the chairman of the Liberal Party.
At this early date, advisers have repeatedly told Mr. Giuliani to refrain from his natural instincts of ferociously attacking Mrs. Clinton, and say they are pleased that he has so far kept himself to what they call "pointed barbs" about her residency -- Mrs. Clinton has never lived in New York -- and her assertion that she has always been a Yankee fan.
One adviser also said Mr. Giuliani found the idea of running against Mrs. Clinton "irresistible."

HEADLINE: Chip Progress Forecast to Hit A Big Barrier

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
For more than three decades, it has been an unshakable principle of the computer industry: every 18 months, the number of transistors that will fit on a silicon chip doubles.
The phenomenon, known as Moore's Law for the semiconductor pioneer who first observed it, has been the basic force underlying the computer revolution and the rise of the Internet. As transistors have been scaled ever smaller, computing performance has risen exponentially while the cost of that power has been driven down. And it has been assumed in the industry that the rate of progress would hold for at least another 10 to 15 years. 
 But now a researcher at Intel, the world's leading chip company, has reported glimpsing a potentially insurmountable barrier to the advance of Moore's Law much closer at hand, perhaps early in the coming decade.
In an article in the journal Science, the Intel scientist, Paul A. Packan, says it is not clear whether the most common type of silicon transistor can be scaled down beyond the generation of chips that will begin to appear next year, because semiconductor engineers have not found ways around basic physical limits.
"These fundamental issues have not previously limited the scaling of transistors," he wrote in the Sept. 24 issue. "There are currently no known solutions to these problems," he added, calling it "the most difficult challenge the semiconductor industry has ever faced."
Dennis Allison, a Silicon Valley physicist and computer designer, said: "The fact that this warning comes from Intel's process group is really significant. This says that they see actual limits."
The report by the Intel scientist will be echoed by researchers from the University of Glasgow in a paper to be presented in December at a conference in Washington.
Without further advances in the miniaturization of silicon-based transistors, hopes for continued progress would have to be based on technologies that are promising but unproved: new materials, new transistor designs and advances like molecular computing, in which single molecules act as digital on-off switches.
To be sure, such dire warnings have been made periodically in the past -- an article in Scientific American in 1987 said Moore's Law was unlikely to be maintained through the 1990's -- and each time semiconductor designers have shown remarkable ingenuity to surmount seemingly impossible barriers.
Indeed, Moore's Law -- first stated in 1965 by Gordon Moore, an Intel co-founder -- proved to be understated; Moore had to revise his initial prediction of 24 months for each doubling of chip capacity. And while it is not an actual physical law, his observation has taken on an almost mystical quality as the clearest expression of the power of human science and engineering and many industry executives have come to see it as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
In the last decade the advances described by Moore's Law have had an accelerating impact on the personal computer industry, driving the cost of desktop machines down from $3,000 to as low as $500 while increasing their power.
The inventors of the original semiconductor design technology are for the most part still bullish about extending that progress, whatever the immediate hurdles.
"Historically the economic incentives to find new methods for device improvement have regularly overcome the predicted scaling limits," said John Moussouris, a physicist and semiconductor designer. "The physical challenges may be getting harder, but the people and financial resources to surmount them are also growing each year."
But for the first time the global semiconductor industry is grappling with transistors so small that the placement of individual atoms will soon become crucial.
For example, in the current generation of semiconductors, the wires that interconnect transistors are etched as fine as 0.18 micron -- one five-hundredth the width of a human hair -- and the individual insulating layers that are inside a transistor may be only four or five atoms thick.
Semiconductor factories in Japan plan to begin mass production of chips based on widths of 0.13 micron early next year, and such chips should be in widespread use within two years. But beyond that generation, the industry's leading researchers acknowledge there remain far more questions than answers.
The next step would be widths of 0.10 micron, a milestone that in the Moore's Law progression would be expected three to five years from now. But at that scale, Mr. Packan writes, transistors will be composed of fewer than 100 atoms, and statistical variations in this Lilliputian world are beyond the ability of semiconductor engineers to control.
Mr. Packan said he had written the Science article to challenge the industry and academia to focus on areas where breakthroughs are needed. "For the last 30 years we've been engineering the device, and now what's required is fundamental science," he said in a telephone interview today.
Intel executives cautioned against reading too much gloom into their technical papers, saying that while they did not yet have precise engineering solutions for breaking the 0.10 micron barrier, they were confident that answers would be found.
They suggested that part of the reason for Intel's recent pessimism might have more to do with the need for corporate secrecy than the arrival of fundamental technical limits.
"We face serious challenges," said Mark Bohr, an Intel technology development director and the co-author of an internal Intel technical paper that enumerates the company's unsolved problems. "We all have ideas to address some of these problems and admittedly they are iffy and not fully developed, and you don't want to tip your cards too soon."
And Carver Mead, a physicist and a pioneer in semiconductor design, says he still adheres to what has been the conventional industry wisdom, suggesting that Moore's Law will continue to account for the pace of silicon technology advances until at least 2014. "There are still some open issues," he said. "and so the Chicken Little sky-is-falling articles are a recurring theme."
But James Heath, a chemistry professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who is a co-inventor of the carbon 60 molecule known as the Buckyball, said the industry might be overly optimistic because it had such a vast investment in today's silicon technology.
With researchers at Hewlett-Packard, Mr. Heath has developed a prototype memory cell the size of a single molecule that operates on different principles from today's semiconductors.
"I think their optimism for being able to continue until 2014 is not very realistic," he said. "When you get to very, very small sizes, you are limited by relying on only a handful of electrons to describe the difference between on and off."
Executives at I.B.M., which along with Intel and Motorola is one of the nation's dominant chip makers, acknowledged that it might be accurate to warn of an impending limit to the shrinking of today's dominant chips, known as C.M.O.'s, or complimentary metal oxide semiconductors. But they said they believed they had found an alternative approach, known as silicon-on-insulator, that held great promise at dimensions of 0.10 micron and smaller.
"This paper is quite consistent with work we've published," said Randall Isaac, vice president for systems technology and science at I.B.M.'s Watson Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. "But when a given technology saturates, it is usually replaced by a new one."

HEADLINE: As Gore Slips, Top Advisers Second-Guess Early Moves

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
When Vice President Al Gore assembled his political high command for a meeting at his residence at the Naval Observatory last April 23, prospects for his Presidential campaign were looking good. Fund-raising was on target. Polls showed him comfortably ahead of former Senator Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination.
But some of Mr. Gore's advisers, noting that Mr. Bradley seemed to be making headway with disaffected Democrats and independents, urged the Vice President to take him on before he gained momentum. 
 Mark Penn, the White House pollster, wrote in a memorandum distributed at the meeting and examined by The New York Times: "Stop the free ride for Bradley. His favorability is growing. And we are letting him get his message out. The campaign must attack everything he says and does."
When the group gathered again on May 11, there was another memorandum from Mr. Penn, this one recommending that campaign officials -- not surrogate speakers -- attack Mr. Bradley directly. The suggested theme: "All talk -- no leadership. Big talk -- no ideas."
But after intense internal discussions, Mr. Gore concluded that any mention of Mr. Bradley would only give his rival more attention. Even Mr. Penn went along with the consensus, according to many participants, convinced that Mr. Gore was safely ahead of Mr. Bradley in the horse-race polls. So the Vice President ignored Mr. Bradley for several months. Behaving as if he were already the Democratic nominee, Mr. Gore saved his critiques for the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
It was not until last week that Mr. Gore uttered Mr. Bradley's name and refocused his campaign on beating back Mr. Bradley. He replaced Mr. Penn and others. And now, several people who played influential roles in the Gore operation say the failure to engage Mr. Bradley sooner was a fundamental misjudgment.
Several Gore advisers point to that as one of a string of miscalculations, missed opportunities and simple misfortune that resulted in a plight that they never anticipated: After entering the Presidential competition with the vast resources of the White House and Democratic establishment behind him -- and more institutional advantages than any candidate in modern times -- Mr. Gore now finds himself in a harrowing battle for his party's nomination.
"Earlier on, the differences between the two could have been painted in bright lights," said Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of Mr. Gore's leading supporters on Capitol Hill, "and it would have been much harder for Mr. Bradley to have gotten any traction."
Mr. Gore has cast himself as the underdog, a maneuver his aides said was designed to diminish expectations even further. Nevertheless, many of Mr. Gore's aides and advisers said they were unnerved, if not panicked, by the state of the campaign. They expressed hope that despite the fast-moving competition for the nomination, there was still time for Mr. Gore, in the words of Roy Neel, a confidant, "to stop the bleeding."
"It's a real dogfight for the nomination," said Mr. Neel, Mr. Gore's first chief of staff in the White House. "All campaigns go through cycles of upheaval, dislocation and turmoil. It happens to the best. But I would never have predicted this. I never did. I don't even think Bill Bradley would have."
Of course, Mr. Gore has time to recover. He is still viewed by Democratic leaders as the favorite for the nomination and enjoys the aggressive support of President Clinton. Although Mr. Bradley is pulling ahead in polls in crucial states like New Hampshire and New York, Mr. Gore is still ahead in other important states like Iowa and in national surveys.
Mr. Gore declined to be interviewed for this article. But in more than a dozen extensive interviews, people in the highest echelons of his operation -- including current and former aides, outside advisers as well as workers in the field -- described the internal deliberations that led to his predicament.
Past and present campaign officials are engaging in a frenzy of post-mortems and recriminations; some are blaming everyone but themselves for giving Mr. Gore inferior advice. But, in the end, they conceded, a campaign is a reflection of its candidate.
"I think he's going to be a great President but he might not be a very good campaign manager," said Lorraine Voles, Mr. Gore's former communications director. "That's not where his skills really lie."
Fearful of reprimands, most of these people agreed on to speak only if they were not identified by name.
A senior campaign official, worried that Mr. Gore might not easily recover, said, "The thing that's most heartbreaking to me is he's a solid, strong candidate who ought to be President for a million different reasons."
 
Campaign Gives Reasons for Slide
Rather than one misguided move, the Gore campaign's current state results from what Mr. Neel described as "a conspiracy of factors." No one will ever know whether different decisions would have left the Vice President in a better position -- or made matters worse.
Still, in the interviews, people in the campaign cited several things that, in hindsight, they would have done differently.
Probably the most fundamental thing, they said, was the Vice President's inclination to mount a traditional, incumbent-style race from the White House. Repeatedly, advisers said, Mr. Gore resisted pleas from some of them to break free from his formal role and present himself as a candidate. Instead, Mr. Gore and others felt that if they cleared the field of his most threatening rivals, notably Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and act as if he were already the nominee, he could stay above the political fray and easily capture the nomination.
Many of Mr. Gore's advisers did not consider that the public might not be eager for a traditional insider's campaign, particularly after impeachment. They said they had conversations about locating the campaign headquarters in Tennessee, but decided it would be too impractical for a Vice President who lives in Washington. And virtually no one, they said, viewed Mr. Bradley as a political menace.
Another miscalculation involved how the candidate was presented, aides said. Mr. Gore was adroit at putting the mechanics in place, like lining up endorsements and building campaign infrastructures in Iowa and New Hampshire. But aides said the campaign did not devote enough attention to explaining Mr. Gore and giving people a reason to support him. "His schedule became so efficient," one said, "that it lost its heart. We were putting out press releases of people endorsing the Vice President. But we didn't say why. It all became about process."
In addition, some aides said, Mr. Gore was prone to micromanaging his campaign, initially run not by one strong manager but by a succession of people with varying responsibilities. As a result, the operation was rife with disorganization, which led to excessive spending and made it harder for Mr. Gore to raise money. Aides said the heavy spending was caused by the campaign's determination to stage fancy (and costly) Presidential-style events -- and by an original reluctance by the Vice President to shed overpaid consultants. For example, the campaign did not think twice about spending $800 for lighting at outdoor events in the middle of the afternoon, just so there would be fewer shadows for the cameras.
With repeated staff reshufflings, the campaign also has been plagued by turmoil and internal skirmishes. Mr. Gore's closest advisers -- including Ronald Klain, who was chief of staff, and Robert Squier, a media adviser -- have been supplanted by relative newcomers. "There was a long time when everyone was in charge -- and no one was in charge," said one top aide. The campaign's two most important forces now are Tony Coelho, the former Congressman who took charge in May, and Carter Eskew, a media consultant.
Mr. Eskew is an old friend of Mr. Gore, but the Vice President and Mr. Coelho do not have a deep history. That is a marked contrast to the tightly-controlled Bradley and Bush operations, which are run by people who have been close to the candidates for years, and have been far more disciplined in putting forth campaign themes and using resources.
People involved in the Gore campaign credit Mr. Coelho for at least taking charge and making decisions. And they credit Mr. Eskew for forcing Mr. Gore to lace his speeches with gripping biographical detail. Yet they complain that upheavals in leadership have left a campaign that is still in turmoil.
Then, there is Mr. Gore's image. Many advisers still recall -- and they shudder when they do -- the news conference in March 1997 when Mr. Gore defended his fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign, declaring repeatedly that there was "no controlling legal authority" that found he had violated the law. They said that performance, and subsequent incidents, have cemented a public impression of Mr. Gore as a plodding, uninspiring politician.
Compounding the image problem, Mr. Gore's advisers said, were Mr. Gore's self-deprecating "stiff jokes." Several aides said they had told the Vice President for months, if not years, that the jokes had run their course. But Mr. Gore continued to make his straight-laced image a constant theme until the spring. Advisers also said that internal polls showed Mr. Gore's image was damaged by his well-publicized boast in March that he was the father of the Internet.
Some problems were not of Mr. Gore's making. The Lewinsky scandal, for instance, froze the campaign throughout 1998. Mr. Gore's aides thought it would appear unseemly to start an overt political campaign for the White House at a time when it would appear that the Vice President was distancing himself from President Clinton's travails.
In something of a Vice Presidential curse, the second in command often has a tough time emerging from the president's shadow. In the runup to his election in 1988, Vice President George Bush was also confronted with discouraging poll numbers. He even pronounced himself the underdog.
"The campaign started with this air of inevitability," Mr. Neel said. "But no one would have predicted Monica Lewinsky two years ago. No one would have predicted that a single Republican would rise out of a pack of nobodies and raise more than $50 million in six or eight months." Mr. Gore has raised raised roughly $24 million, and Mr. Bradley, who took in more than Mr. Gore in the last quarter, has raised $18 million.
 
Bradley Was Seen As No One to Fear
As recently as two years ago, Mr. Gore seemed perfectly poised to win the nomination. Month after month, he painstakingly courted Jewish leaders and constituencies like labor, and he toiled behind-the-scenes to demonstrate that he had so much political muscle that most of his rivals bowed out of the race, from Mr. Gephardt to Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska to Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts.
Mr. Gore's advisers eyed Mr. Gephardt as the greatest threat because he could best compete for all of the institutional advantages that the Vice President wanted, from fund-raising to endorsements from lawmakers and unions. Mr. Gore and his advisers were so preoccupied with denying Mr. Gephardt any advantages -- he devoted much of last year cozying up to the House leader -- that they took steps like hiring Mr. Gephardt's speech writers.
"It became such an obsession," said one adviser. Asked about Mr. Bradley, the adviser said, "I don't think anyone ever thought it would be a big deal if he ran."
So when Mr. Gephardt announced in February that he would not run, Mr. Gore and his people felt that the campaign was on track. "When people dropped out of the race, that kept us feeding on the idea that Gore's got a good grip on things," said another top adviser. "It fed the overestimation of our strength."
Had Mr. Bradley been prodded out of the race by Mr. Gore, the Vice President would have had an easy path to the nomination. But several Gore advisers believe that he would have been better off with several rather than one opponent competing for the anti-Gore, anti-Clinton vote.
"We were victims of our own early success," Mr. Neel said. "Our wanting an unopposed primary led us to be successful -- almost."
Senator Harkin said the campaign had lulled itself into a false sense of security. "As Vice President, you come into the race and you don't see any real opposition out there," he said. "All your polls are good. The economy's great. Unemployment's low. The stars look all lined up. I would fault the campaign for one thing: They put it into fourth gear before he started out in first gear."
 
A Daunting Search For the Right Image
Even when Mr. Bradley made clear he was running for President, the Gore campaign took months to retool its strategy. It was in many ways modeled after Mr. Clinton's re-election bid: For as long as possible, appear Presidential, and do not make it seem as if you are running for President.
That is why, when Mr. Gore formed a campaign organization and filed papers with the Federal Election Commission, the move was announced on New Year's Eve so few people would notice. The campaign did not even plan to launch Mr. Gore's showy announcement tour until this fall.
"They legitimately, though incorrectly, thought they could wait to put a campaign together well into '99," Mr. Neel said.
Eventually, Mr. Bush's momentum -- and Mr. Bradley's -- led the Gore campaign to move up its announcement to June. But many of Mr. Gore's advisers now say the announcement tour was completely fumbled.
Aides said the campaign was preoccupied with the announcement for two months and lavished enormous amounts of money on it. Even so, the tour was marred by production failures. And Mr. Gore's decision to use the occasion to chastise the President for the Lewinsky scandal further hindered the Vice President from establishing his own identity. Several advisers said they regretted that Mr. Gore spewed out too many policy positions.
While the strategy worked for Mr. Clinton, it was more problematic for Mr. Gore because he had no governing authority and the public did not have a fixed view of him or his accomplishements.
"What we needed to do was more forcefully give people a sense of who Al Gore is and what's in his heart as opposed to what's in his head," said one adviser. "We began a little too cerebral with issues. That was a mistake."
Many of Mr. Gore's people say the entire announcement tour was a waste of time and money.
"Announcing in June was a mistake -- it was too soon," said an aide. "It was an overcompensation for an earlier mistake. He had spent four months not being a candidate -- the perception was that the only way to get out as a candidate was to announce. But we spent the months of May and June doing nothing but getting ready for the announcement. And we ended up getting mixed press from it at a critical time."
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, a Gore supporter, said the campaign's most daunting challenge now is to overcome its image as inept. "Everyone's telling horror stories -- whether they're true or not, they catch on," he said. "We have to turn this thing around."
