HEADLINE: Reacting to Wall Street, European Markets Fall

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Taking a cue from the steep drop in stock prices in the United States on Tuesday, markets across Europe plunged today as investors dumped stocks and sought refuge in bonds.
In London, equities fell nearly 1.7 percent. In Paris and Milan, stock indexes were off 0.96 percent and 1.83 percent, respectively. Here in Frankfurt, stocks were hit hardest, falling 2 percent. 
Analysts said that as interest rates have risen, the realization that bonds offer a better return for the risk than stocks prompted many investors to move out of equities.
Though the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last week, analysts said that interest rates in the United States could go higher still. A further climb could continue to depress equities markets and bolster the value of bonds.
"Europe did nothing original today," said Steven Dalby, head of equities at Commerzbank here. "It just followed the same trend that we saw in America last night -- firm bonds and weak equities."
Rates have been driven somewhat higher in Europe as markets respond to the rising American rates. But they have not moved up as sharply because central banks such as the German Bundesbank have refrained from raising key lending rates to contain inflation, as the Federal Reserve has done.
After the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 91 points in the final hours of trading in New York on Tuesday, the stage was set for big drops today in both Asia and Europe. Tokyo's market was closed today, but Hong Kong's fell precipitously in the first few minutes, then spent the rest of the day trying to recover. Similarly, European exchanges experienced most of their losses for the day in the first few minutes of trading.
In Frankfurt, the DAX index fell an immediate 36 points, firmed for much of the day and then drifted another 6 points lower, closing at 2,033.31. The Financial Times stock index in London dropped 44.7 points at the opening, and eventually closed down 51.2 points at 3,027.5.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index opened off 29 points but recovered some losses, closing down 18.32 points at 1,893.09. And in Milan, the BCI index fell 11.63 points for the day, to 623.64.
Equities markets in Europe have had troubles this year, and rising rates have not helped. Though most nations are coming out of recession and corporate earnings are recovering from the depressed levels of 1992 and 1993, the full impact of the earnings recovery will not be seen until 1995. As a result, stock prices relative to this year's earnings seem high to many investors.
As long as interest rates stayed steady, investors were willing to sit back and wait until next year's earnings materialized, analysts said. But once rates started moving up, the incentive changed, they said.
In Italy, the market has fallen 4.3 percent in two days. On Tuesday, Milan stocks fell 2.8 percent following reports that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was under investigation for possible bribery. Today, the Italian lira fell to an all-time low against the German mark and a five-month low against the dollar.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Rally Continues On Flight From Stocks

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities continued to rally yesterday for a second consecutive session, benefiting from a flight by investors out of stocks into bonds.
Bond prices surged early in the day day and gyrated through much of the trading, ending slightly below the highs for the day. Still, yesterday's rally was the biggest since the end of July. 
 "There was a lot of investing in the long and intermediate part of the yield curve as carry-over from Tuesday's rally spilled over into today's abbreviated session," said Christopher F. Fitzmaurice, vice president for Government trading at Salomon Brothers.
The price of the 30-year Treasury rose 28/32 of a percentage point, to 9431/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell below the psychologically important level of 8 percent, to 7.94 percent, from 8.02 percent on Tuesday. The yield is at its lowest since Oct. 19, when it was 7.89 percent. In the last two days, bondholders gained $18.75 for every $1,000 invested.
The cash market for Treasury securities closed early yesterday, at 2 P.M., and will be closed today in observance of Thanksgiving. The Public Securities Association, a trade group of securities dealers, has recommended that the cash market close at 2 P.M. tomorrow.
Jay Goldinger, market strategist at Capital Insight of Beverly Hills, Calif., said the late-day rally on Tuesday caught many dealers by surprise. He said he had never seen such a degree of short-covering in 20 years.
Short-covering occurs when market participants have sold borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices. But if prices begin to rise -- as they did on Tuesday -- these participants must cover their short positions by buying back the securities to limit their losses.
"There was just no where to go and many dealers were caught real bad," Mr. Goldinger said.
The bond market's recent reversal of fortune did not come as a total surprise to some market participants, given recent increases in interest rates and the prospect of another in the near term. The market had been oversold, they said, and was due for an upturn.
"Most of the damage has already been done to long-term bonds, whose yields are within 25 to 50 basis points of their highs for this cycle," said Ken McAlley, head of the U.S. Trust Corporation's fixed-income division. "Just as yields overshot going down, they overshot going up."
Mr. McAlley said most of the damage to bonds was done in the February and March after the first of six increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve. While the market has appeared dismal since then, he says the picture is brightening. But don't reach for the sunglasses just yet, traders caution.
The bond market still has a long way to go before it shakes off the effects of this year's slump. Compared with price losses since February, the gains in the last two days of trading have been paltry.
So while a further correction in stocks may generate euphoria in the fixed-income markets, many traders are still going to take advantage of the recent gains and use it as an opportunity to sell. Stock prices gyrated yesterday before ending lower, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 3.36 points.
But traders said continued weakness in stocks could also make it more difficult for the Fed to move quickly again on interest rates. Higher interest rates undermine stock prices by increasing corporate financing costs and making fixed-income investments more attractive by virtue of a higher return.
The focus on stocks yesterday overshadowed the release of durable goods and claims data. In the day's only major economic report, the Commerce Department said that factory orders for durable goods fell an unexpected 1.5 percent in October amid weakened demand for autos, aircraft and military hardware. It was the first decline in three months. Traders also said that the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for November showed a decline to 91.6 from 92.7 in October. The index has been bouncing around in a five-point range all year, and the November reading is in the middle of that range.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Benefits From Gains Registered in Bond Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar firmed against most leading currencies yesterday, bolstered by gains in the United States bond market.
"The market is definitely worried about stocks, but some bond managers are buying dollars," said Richard Koss, currency sales manager at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York. 
 Treasury securities posted their best two-day performance since July yesterday and Tuesday, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond below 8 percent for the first time in three weeks. American stock prices, however, fell yesterday for the fifth consecutive session. Currency dealers watch American securities markets -- particularly the bond market -- to gauge demand from foreign investors for American assets and the dollars needed to buy them.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5556 German marks from 1.5527 marks on Tuesday. The dollar edged up to 98.47 yen, from 98.23 yen on Tuesday.
Currency trading was thin yesterday with foreign-exchange desks in New York closing early ahead of Thanksgiving and with banks and markets closed in Japan for a national holiday. There will be trading today in Asia and Europe.
Traders are reassessing their recent bullishness toward the dollar. The effects of two interventions in the foreign-exchange market by the United States earlier this month have waned, the Republican victory is being reinterpreted and traders are awaiting the next increase in United States interest rates.
Meanwhile, the speed of Tuesday's stock market plunge has currency dealers worried.
"I think the dollar goes back down to 1.53 marks," Mr. Koss of Canadian Imperial Bank said. "You're dealing with the psychology of mobs more than economics or good trading practices."
In other currency trading in New York, the Italian lira recovered after hitting a record low against the mark in Europe. The lira was battered on Tuesday on the news that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was being investigated on corruption charges. The lira fell to a record low of 1,037.90 to the mark, but rose in New York to 1,033.60 to the mark. The dollar fell to 1,607.50 lire, from 1,609 lire on Tuesday.
The British pound rose to $1.5705 from $1.5695. The dollar gained against the Swiss franc, rising to 1.3190 francs from 1.3180 francs. The Canadian dollar fell to 72.75 United States cents from 72.78 cents.

HEADLINE: 250 Groups To Share In Grants For Arts

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
About 250 New York City arts organizations have qualified for matching grants from a $10 million fund set up by the state and city governments in July, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday.
The list includes big institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum, both of which plan to use the promised money -- a total of more than $800,000 each -- to open all of the galleries that have been closed on a rotating basis because of cutbacks in operating budgets. 
 Many smaller organizations were awarded grants of only a few thousand dollars, with the Paul Taylor Dance Foundation, for example, receiving a pledge of $5,000. Under the terms of the program, called the Challenge-Grant Initiative, applicants must match any public funds dollar for dollar with money raised from other sources. Many of the smaller groups set modest goals.
Mr. Giuliani announced the awards at a celebratory gathering in the Metropolitan's Temple of Dendur, and there was hardly a back left unclapped among the 300 state and city cultural officials, fund-raisers and artists at the ceremony. The Mayor has stood by his commitment to support the arts despite his battles with the City Council over cutting the city budget elsewhere, saying that culture is essential to the economy and to the soul of New York.
There is some question, though, whether Governor-elect George E. Pataki will go along with the grant program as he begins to deal with a multi-billion-dollar budget shortfall. The state split its pledges last summer, promising $2.5 million this year and $2.5 million next. "I haven't looked at the details of this aspect of the budget yet," said Elizabeth P. McCaughey, the Lieutenant Govenor-elect, who represented the state at yesterday's announcement. "I have no comment."
The Metropolitan and the Brooklyn museums have each been promised $421,000 from the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald to match their combined city and state grants. The American Museum of Natural History also qualified for $421,000 in public money, according to yesterday's announcement. Another major recipient, the New York Shakespeare Festival, got $293,000.
Some institutions received more city and state support than they ever have in the past. The Whitney Museum of American Art is one. "In the past we've gotten no more than $5,000 from the city in support," said Michael Wolfe, the museum's chief financial officer. "Now the city is giving us $30,000, that's six times the amount we were normally receiving and that's a significant increase. The state is coming in with $100,000 in its Challenge Grant Initiative on top of $101,000 we've already received for general operating support and for funding electronic media projects."
Among the mid-sized and smaller institutions that received grants from the city and state were Dance Theater of Harlem, which got $50,000, and the Brooklyn Children's Museum, which got $94,500.
"Initially, we were worried that smaller groups wouldn't be able to find the matching money," said John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "I believe they will. They have until next year to come up with the matching funds."
Norma Mudd, the chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, an advocacy group, said she was neither disappointed nor surprised by the list of recipients "The dance community didn't do so well, but then many of them didn't apply," she said. "The time line with which these grants had to be made made it difficult. Economic development is not based on one-shot deals. It takes time to properly plan, so this probably won't produce much new money."
Among those attending the ceremony were the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, Schuyler G. Chapin; the chairwoman of the New York State Council for the Arts, Kitty Carlisle Hart; State Senator Roy Goodman; Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan's director, and William Leurs, its president; and and Robert T. Buck, director of the Brooklyn Museum.
Martin Segel, a former head of Lincoln Center who was an architect of the grant program, said: "We feel today as if a new born child was born. It took roughly nine months, but across the board everybody has benefited from it."
Mr. Dyson said that 508 applications had been received. "Roughly half got funding, which is more than we anticipated," he said. "This is the arts as an economic development. When I look at the future of the city and of New York and I ask why should a business be in New York and not in Topeka, this is the reason. We have something nobody else has: the richness of cultural activity."
Still, some have questioned whether the program is really going to generate new giving or just the repackaging of money from those who always give in any case. "Does it really matter?" asked Mr. Luers of the Metropolitan. Referring to a family that has been generous with donations to both the Metropolitan and the Brooklyn museums, he continued: "This is the first time the Cantors have given money for operating expenses. These contributions were specially earmarked for this."

HEADLINE: Don't Cave In on Myanmar

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, after struggling messily for nearly two years with the dilemmas of human rights diplomacy, seems at last to have arrived at a consistent approach: Deny reality, declare things are getting better and lower the pressure on authoritarian regimes. Now, at least, tyrannies large and small, from China to Indonesia to Myanmar, can count on consistent treatment.
Until this month Myanmar, the former Burma, stood out as the principled exception to the Administration's complaisance. While Asian and European countries cozied up to the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, Washington refused to forget about the Slorc's record of trampling on elections, complicity with drug lords and continuing atrocities against civilians. 
 According to a just-released U.N. report, these include random shootings and summary executions, mass rape, torture, forced labor and the relocation of more than one million people. To maintain pressure for change, the U.S. curtailed diplomatic relations, suspended aid, blocked loans from international banks and repeatedly criticized the Slorc's crimes in international forums.
In early November, the Administration dispatched a top official to Myanmar with what it characterized as a tough message: If the Slorc continued on its course, the U.S. would intensify its efforts to isolate the regime internationally. But if it took clear and specific steps to ease repression and establish democratic rule, relations could improve.
The Slorc listened politely, but yielded nothing beyond continuing symbolic talks with the country's most prominent imprisoned democrat, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Yet last week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher claimed to discern "somewhat promising" results from the mission and suggested that the Administration was now prepared to take a conciliatory approach to Myanmar.
Economic engagement can indirectly benefit human rights by raising living standards and strengthening a middle class, which often becomes a key pressure group for liberal reforms. But the connection is scarcely automatic, as rich but repressive Singapore demonstrates. It is particularly problematic in Myanmar, where key enterprises are run by the military and where the spread of forced labor suggests an economy headed toward feudalism, not capitalism.
Similarly, diplomatic engagement can bring progress when the government doing the engaging drives tough bargains and insists that its terms be met. But tough talk followed by the pretense that cosmetic changes are "somewhat promising" only encourages contemptuous abuse.
How sad to recall that Bill Clinton once denounced George Bush for "coddling dictators." His human rights performance in office begins to make Mr. Bush, who never pretended to be other than a hard-headed realist, look like a bleeding heart.

HEADLINE: Election Harvest Crowds Thanksgiving Table

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Election Day and Thanksgiving are close together on the calendar, but this year they are worlds apart in mood. 
 On Thanksgiving we remember the devout Pilgrims thanking God for their good fortune at having made it to the harvest, and we try to imitate their deep sense of gratitude at our good fortune.
On Election Day this year, by contrast, the American electorate registered the most selfish, stingy statement I can recall in my 63 years. The country's spirit, as I remember it, was far more generous in the Great Depression, when a quarter of the work force was unemployed; in World War II, when a large share of our young men had to put their lives at great risk; in the years of the Marshall Plan, the Berlin airlift, Brown v. Board of Education and the civil rights struggles.
Even in our terrible internal conflicts over the Vietnam War, I never saw the stingy complaining that came with the election of '94.
This country, with 1.5 million people behind bars (a larger proportion than any other country, including Indonesia, Zaire, North Korea and Iraq), voted to build more prisons, due surely to the general perception that not enough people are locked up. Does it seem paradoxical to anyone that the richest country has the most people in jail?
In this country of immigrants, California voted to cut off schooling and medical care for the people the state allows to sneak in to do its farm work and clean its houses.
This country, with the lowest tax rate in the industrialized world, screamed that its taxes are too high.
The fundamentalists kept talking about two passages from the Bible on the subject of homosexuality, but they never mention the hundreds of passages of Scripture that speak about the poor.
The State of New York, which resents treating its mentally ill, housing its 100,000 homeless and taking seriously the responsibility to educate its inner-city youth, decided it pays too much in taxes! It elected a Governor who promised to cut these taxes by 25 percent. Not a word in the campaign about the need to increase services.
Most of us are much more comfortable than our parents were, and way ahead of our grandparents. Most of us are enjoying excellent health and have no fear of a group of diseases that were so frightening only 50 or 60 years ago. Our expected life span is longer. Yet we refuse to extend the benefits of modern medical care to 35 million fellow citizens (most of them children) who do not have any health insurance.
The epidemics of AIDS and crack are creating a new population of orphans, and conservative computer projections predict 80,000 of these by the year 2000. The country has just elected representatives who want to reduce benefits for impoverished children. Representative Newt Gingrich says we should bring back the orphan asylum. What could be more mean-spirited?
I have a great deal to be thankful for this holiday. This includes my education, my work, the security of my home, my ability to pass much of this onto my children, the security of our health. But I cannot be thankful for generosity of spirit in my country.

Relax, Democrats

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Liberal Democrats in hallucinatory moments see the great Democratic social structures of the last half-century crumbling at their feet. Not to worry, Democrats. There are a few things working for you: 
 * Your new minority positions in the House and Senate are no weaker than those of the Republicans of recent years, and the parliamentary tricks of the trade they employed so skillfully are still available to you.
* You have the power of the Presidency on your side, and no matter what Bill Clinton's popularity ratings show, responsible Americans of all stripes still respect and support that office.
* We live in a centrist society of limited political mobility, moving off center by increments. Beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt, it has taken more than 50 years to put together the social programs that frame today's society; and huff and puff all he will, Newt Gingrich can't blow them down overnight or in two years. We don't move that fast.
* Our political center is no longer where it was a half-century ago. When Social Security and Medicare came into being, they were left of center; today they are solidly central in our political spectrum. Attacks on these and other core programs of the Great Society are no longer attacks on the left, but on the much less vulnerable center.
The Republicans will tinker and tamper with our social structures, but after all, these institutions are decades old and can stand some overhauling. Democrats may be surprised to find them emerging from the shop stronger than ever.
But if the Republicans try to destroy the fundamental social and economic programs that have brought this country to the 21st century as the strongest, most desirable and admired country in the world, stand firm, Democrats, and carry on your fight. You're still in the mainstream.

HEADLINE: TWO SENATORS VIE TO LEAD MINORITY

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
When Senate Democrats pick a new leader next week, they will be guessing at which of two relatively young, fairly liberal supporters of President Clinton can best make the party's case in a political era that seems devoted not to youth, not to liberalism and not to the President.
Neither of the two, Tom Daschle, a second-termer from South Dakota, and Christopher J. Dodd, a third-termer from Connecticut, has staked out any clear philosophical differences from the other. 
 The liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave each of them a 75 percent rating in 1993. This year, the American Conservative Union says, Mr. Daschle voted right 4 percent of the time and Mr. Dodd never.
Mr. Dodd, who entered the race for minority leader only after Election Day, is campaigning publicly. He has been ready with a riposte to Senator Jesse Helms or any other Republican with his head out of a foxhole, trying to demonstrate how he would handle combat with the new Senate majority.
Mr. Dodd cites his six years of service in the minority the last time the Republicans controlled the Senate, from 1981 to 1987, as evidence that he is the man for these times, able to "fight effectively where that is called for and cooperate effectively where that is called for."
Mr. Daschle (pronounced DASH-uhl) has campaigned for the leadership post by the more traditional route, courting Senate Democrats privately. Although only four years younger than his 50-year-old rival, he speaks of his youth, along with his Western roots, as reason to choose him.
And, making a virtue of his relative obscurity, he said in an interview that it would help Democrats if they recognized "the need to project a new image." He said that as someone "not as nationally recognized, I would be a very positive new face."
Mr. Daschle claims commitments of support from 24 colleagues. Added to his own vote, that would be one more than enough to win when the 47 Senate Democrats hold secret balloting on Friday morning of next week.
Mr. Dodd said he had expected Mr. Daschle to be able to lock up the leadership position right after Election Day, following the defeat of Mr. Daschle's only rival at the time, Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, whom Mr. Dodd was supporting. When that did not happen, Mr. Dodd said, he abided by the urging of several senators, whom he would not identify, and entered the race.
He said he thought he had a good chance of winning, adding, "I understand the difference between a compliment and a commitment."
Discussing Mr. Daschle's difficulty in nailing down support, some Senate aides, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the post for which he had earlier won promises of backing was that of majority leader. Once the Republicans gained Senate control in the elections, these aides said, he encountered a problem in translating those earlier promises into backing for another post, the minority leadership, which frequently demands greater skills at combat with the opposing party.
Mr. Daschle's support tends to come most from junior senators, and Mr. Dodd's from the veterans. But supporters on both sides acknowledge that they lack measures to gauge which of the two would do a better job of protecting Democratic interests in an uncertain political era when the task of drawing some differences from President Clinton may be harder to figure out than the matter of responding to Republicans.
Each leadership candidate is an earnest backer of the particular economic interests of his state. Mr. Daschle supports grain farming, Mr. Dodd submarine construction and the insurance industry.
Where insurance was a leading topic in this year's debate on health care legislation, farm subsidies may come to the fore in the coming Congressional session as Republicans try to cut spending. It is an issue on which the Republican leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, may feel less besieged if a Democrat from a farm state, like his, heads the minority.
Both senators were critical of filibusters, saying that under their leadership Democrats would use them less than Republicans did in 1994. Mr. Daschle called the filibuster "one of the most abused parliamentary tools of the Senate," although he said he was not in favor of abolishing it entirely.
And while Mr. Dodd warned against undermining "the unique pillars of the Senate" and said the protection of the minority was essential, he also said that if filibusters were maintained at the current rate, the Senate would "continue to have a totally irresponsible behavior, and there will be a growing sentiment to change fundamentally the institution of the Senate."
"We have an obligation," he said, "to keep the institution fundamentally intact."
Mr. Daschle said he should be chosen because he would be able to unify the often divided Democratic caucus and help the Democrats build in the Midwest and the West. He has a reputation as an able associate of the departing Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, who is retiring from the Senate, and as a deeply committed advocate of health care legislation.
Mr. Dodd spoke more in terms of dealing with the Republicans. He cited his ability to pick up their votes on issues like child care and family and medical leave.
But since Election Day he has repeatedly shown his talent at partisan combat as well, most clearly in his denunciation on Tuesday of Senator Helms, who had remarked that Mr. Clinton might need a bodyguard if he visited any military installations in Mr. Helms's home state, North Carolina. Referring to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy exactly 31 years before, Mr. Dodd said:
"To suggest on this day of all days, Nov. 22, that an American President's life might be in jeopardy because they were to visit an American military base would suggest that my colleague from North Carolina doesn't seem to know what country he's living in."

HEADLINE: In Navajos' Towns, A New Tactic to Fill A Void in Banking

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHINLE, Ariz.

 BODY:
Water is scarce amid the white limestone cliffs, sandstone canyons and drought-browned prairie grasses of the Navajo Reservation. But banks are even scarcer.
The last one to operate here still sits beside Route 191, propped up on cinder blocks: a mobile home that was a Citibank branch and was never very popular. For every dollar deposited, it put out at best a few pennies in loans, infuriating the 25,000 residents of this town and the surrounding hills. 
 But since Citibank closed the branch six years ago, the situation has become worse. Making a deposit or seeking a loan has meant a round-trip drive of nearly 140 miles.
Nowhere else in the country is a town this size so far from the nearest bank, regulators say. But soon, because of a Clinton Administration policy that many bankers dislike, Chinle will have a bank again.
Federal regulators see the experience here as a model for the future, not only for Native Americans but for those in other poor, isolated communities and some urban neighborhoods as well.
When the Norwest Corporation, a bank based in Minneapolis, sought to acquire Citibank's Arizona operations last year, the Navajo tribal government filed a formal protest under an obscure Federal law requiring that banks do business in poor communities as well as wealthy ones within their areas of service.
The Clinton Administration ended up approving the acquisition. But the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which has the power to approve or reject all bank mergers, invoked the 17-year-old community lending law for the first time. That effectively required Norwest to provide more banking services to the Navajos.
Norwest is now building three new branches on the reservation, including one here and another in Kayenta, and a third in Tuba City to replace an existing trailer.
The regulators are also investigating whether another bank, which they refused to identify, may have ignored Native Americans.
Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, said the Administration had no intention of retreating from community lending issues. And Mr. Ludwig, who attended Oxford University and then Yale Law School with President Clinton, has the influence to carry the policy through.
"I don't think we will change the way we've operated," he said. "We call them as we see them."
Mr. Ludwig's move here preceded the Justice Department's settlement in August with Chevy Chase Federal, the Maryland savings institution that was required to open branches in predominantly black neighborhoods in the Washington area. Banks and their lobbyists have hopes that the new Republican majority in Congress will block the Justice Department from similar actions.
Mr. Ludwig's actions have drawn less attention, but the Clinton Administration is likely to rely on his office's power to review mergers and other bank activities, particularly if the Justice Department is thwarted.
Moreover, his actions are much less open to challenge by lawmakers, because of legislation passed in the wake of the numerous bank failures during the Great Depression. That legislation gave the nation's financial overseers far more discretionary power than nearly any other group of regulators.
The defunct Citibank branch here served as a backdrop to a parade on Veteran's Day. Local residents, who gathered on a gravel parking lot, said they were eager for something to be done and bitter toward bankers who had long ignored them.
"I guess they don't care for us," said Roy Natoh, a 73-year-old former marine wearing a red windbreaker, a red peaked hat with medals and a necklace and bracelet of large turquoise beads.
Not that they were all that happy about the branch that Citibank used to operate out of a mobile trailer here. "The way I looked at it, it wasn't too safe, because people with evil minds, traveling through, had easy access for holdups," said Carl Yazzie Jr., a 54-year-old Marine Corps veteran who wore his dress uniform for the small parade, which featured a single float carrying a black papier-mache gun on the back of a pickup truck.
Besides a military background, Mr. Natoh and Mr. Yazzie share something else: Both men ended up building their small houses out of their personal savings.
Citibank and banks near the reservation turned down Mr. Yazzie's applications, while Mr. Natoh did not even try, viewing the odds as impossibly long. "I tried to get a loan, but I got nowhere with them," said Mr. Yazzie, who is the town treasurer here.
Their experiences are not unusual. Federal Reserve figures released last month showed that few Native Americans even applied for mortgages in 1993, and that their rejection rate held steady from the year before at about 25 percent. By contrast, the rate of rejections fell markedly in 1993 for every other racial group.
Citibank and other banks doing business with Native Americans in the West contend that they are not to blame. In a filing last year with Federal regulators, Citibank said not enough Navajos kept savings and checking accounts for the Chinle branch to be profitable. They also said the murkiness of the tribal foreclosure laws made it difficult to seize houses and other collateral for overdue loans.
Peterson Zah, the Navajos' elected president, denied that Navajo foreclosure laws were any more difficult for banks to use than state laws, which are not in force on the reservation. But in a move to appease lenders, the highest Navajo court issued its first comprehensive guidance to tribal courts last spring on the way to handle foreclosures.
Susan Weeks, a spokeswoman for Citibank, also pointed out that while the bank used the mobile trailers as branches in Kayenta and Chinle, it did not install them. Great Western Bank, which sold its Arizona branch network to Citibank in 1986, installed the trailers. Before closing the branches, Citibank tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Navajo tribal government to deposit more money in them, she said.
Most bankers deny any aversion to lending to Native Americans. But a few, in describing what they say are cultural obstacles, express statements that border on the hostile.
After insisting on anonymity, the vice chairman and chief executive of one bank said Native Americans were unsuited to making timely loan repayments. "We are only a few generations from these people being nomads and living in teepees, and that makes a difference," he said.
Citibank also shut down in 1988 a mobile trailer branch in Kayenta, a town with a spectacular backdrop of pink rock buttes that Detroit advertising executives love to use as car pedestals. The former branch once had a towing hitch, now removed.
"People used to comment that someone would just hook up and tow it away," said Austin Hall, a 32-year-old construction worker in Kayenta.
 Michael D. Kinnson, who used to run Citibank's operations on the Navajo Reservation and now runs Norwest's, says Norwest is lending 35 to 40 cents for every dollar of deposits at the two Navajo Reservation branches that Citibank never closed, in Tuba City and Window Rock, Ariz.
In its filing with regulators, Citibank said the Window Rock branch was lending 13 cents for every dollar of deposits, while the Navajo tribal government said only 3 cents in loans were made for every dollar of deposits.
"The only other place where you find that kind of ratio is in retirement communities," where few people seek loans, said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Federal Reserve Board governor who handles consumer issues.
The national average is 60 cents in loans for every dollar of deposits, with banks investing the rest mainly in Treasury bonds.
Economic development experts attribute the scarcity of bank branches, at least in part, to the poverty of the reservation. That makes it difficult for the residents to borrow money to set up new businesses, and often forces them to visit banks at towns off the reservation, where they then spend much of their money.
Residents currently receive paychecks and Government assistance totaling $1 billion a year, and spend an estimated $800 million of it outside the reservation.
Navajo officials hope that the extra Norwest branches will encourage more residents to do their shopping and other business on the reservation. Mr. Zah described an elderly Navajo woman who recently told him that the current situation, "is like the river running down from the mountains and going all the way out to the cities -- the river is the money and it runs by us without stopping."
To file petitions with Federal bank regulators, she added, " 'is to pick up our spades and dig a dam to divert the river, so we can water our livestock,' " Mr. Zah said.

Map/Diagram: "A Long Way From a Teller"
 Federal regulators say the Navajo Reservation in the Four Corners region of the Southwest has been among the rural areas most thinly served by banks. For the last six years, the residents of some towns have had to make round trips of nearly 140 miles to visit a bank branch.

HEADLINE: Canada's Trade Efforts Raise Hackles at Home

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Canada is pursuing fast-growing markets in Asia and the Pacific to reduce its dependence on the economy of its neighbor, the United States, though not without some public misgivings at home.
Earlier this month, the largest Canadian trade delegation to visit China came away with $6.5 billion of deals with the Chinese. Team Canada, as the Canadian news media nicknamed the delegation in sports parlance, won Beijing's attention with its political influence. 
 It was led by Prime Minister Jean Chretien and included 9 of Canada's 10 provincial premiers. Only Jacques Parizeau of Quebec stayed away.
The Canadians signed more than 50 commercial agreements, ranging from hockey tournaments to nuclear reactors, with the Chinese during the six-day visit. The deals could create thousands of jobs for Canadian workers in an economy with 10 percent unemployment.
Other more modest agreements were signed in Indonesia, when Mr. Chretien joined the leaders of 17 other nations at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting this month. He also visited Vietnam and announced, along with a $36 million aid package, that Canada would extend preferential trade status to Hanoi.
"Our Government is conscious of the need to have more eggs out there and not just have them in one basket," said Jim Moore, vice president for policy at the Canadian Exporters Association. "It's not so much a de-emphasis of the United States as the primary market for most Canadian companies as it is a need to remember that other parts of the world -- Asia Pacific and Latin America -- are expanding at an enormous rate."
The mission to China best illustrated Canada's drive for trade with other countries on the Pacific Rim. But China's poor record on human rights has also prompted the kind of criticism from Canadian human rights advocates that has become familiar in the United States.
"I'm disturbed when I see the public debate has become one of rights versus trade," Mr. Chretien said. "We must have both,"
Mr. Chretien has insisted that China would change through what he called "increased mutual understanding and contact."
Other criticism by Canadians has focused on the biggest component of the trade agreement with China. A memorandum of understanding would let Beijing buy two 685-megawatt Candu-6 nuclear reactors from Canada. About two-thirds of the $2.5 billion cost would be financed by Canadian taxpayers, through the Government's export credit agency.
The reactors are manufactured by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., a state-owned company that employs 4,200 workers. The work force has been threatened with cutbacks, because of Ottawa's search for budget savings.
Three Candu reactors were sold to South Korea in 1990. The sale of two to China would take some pressure off Atomic Energy, which lost $101 million last year and depends heavily on Government subsidies.
Some critics in Canada warn of the risks in selling sophisticated reactors to a country like China that refuses to abide by copyright laws and seems willing to pirate technology. Other critics complain that Canada has never before sold its nuclear technology to a state with nuclear weapons, and that China has refused to respect the unofficial moratorium on nuclear testing adopted by other nuclear powers.
"When you look closely at it, this deal is outrageous," said Dr. Gordon Edwards, president of the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, which represents 300 environmental, professional, labor and other organizations.
Candu reactors have embarrassed Canada in the past. India used Candu technology in the 1970's to help build its first bomb. Romania bought a Candu reactor in 1981, and was found later to be using forced labor to construct it.
Robert Nixon, chairman of Atomic Energy, said, "We are confident that all the necessary safeguards are built into this deal."
Canada's heavy dependence on trade with the United States is a big factor in the push for Asian markets. The United States takes 80 percent of Canada's exports, a level that many Canadians feel inhibits their country's economic independence.
"The reality is that our future is linked to our ability to be globally competitive," said Tim Page, senior vice president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

HEADLINE: Milton J. Shapp Is Dead at 82; Ex-Governor of Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
Milton Jerrold Shapp, former Governor of Pennsylvania and a Philadelphia industrialist who was the first Jew to mount a campaign for the Presidential nomination of a major party, died on Thursday at Lankenau Hospital in the Philadelphia suburb of Wynnewood. He was 82.
 The cause was Alzheimer's disease, family friends said. 
 Mr. Shapp, a Democrat, served as Governor from 1971 to 1979 and brought an income tax and lottery to the state. He ran unsuccessfully for President in 1976.
 Before he became Governor, Mr. Shapp was politically active with President John F. Kennedy and is credited with promoting the idea that eventually led to the creation of the Peace Corps.
 Fresh out of the Army Signal Corps after World War II, during which he was a captain and served in North Africa, Italy and Austria, Mr. Shapp, an electrical engineer, founded the Jerrold Electronics Corporation in 1948. The company went public in 1956 and did $25 million-a-year in business. A decade later, when Mr. Shapp sold his interests, the corporation's business was up to $50 million a year.
 Born in Cleveland, Mr. Shapp attended the Cleveland public schools and earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University) in 1933.
 He entered public life in 1960, when he became an early supporter of Mr. Kennedy. In the 1960 election, he served as chairman of the Business and Professional Committee for John Kennedy in the Mid-Atlantic States. During that campaign, Mr. Shapp suggested to Mr. Kennedy the idea of forming a Peace Corps. In a speech at Penn State University on March 9, 1961, entitled "Peace and the Peace Corps," Mr. Shapp outlined for the first time the basic policies that were to serve as a guide for the operation of that organization.
 He returned briefly to business in mid-1963, but plunged very quickly again into politics. He made an unsuccessful run for the Senate in 1964. After that effort failed, he worked in the campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson and organized businessmen in the East for him as he had done for President Kennedy.
 Mr. Shapp won national attention for his consumer-advocate policies and his innovative programs for elderly and handicapped people, including using lottery money for elderly people. He was largely credited with bringing Pennsylvania back from the brink of deficit.
 Mr. Shapp also instituted full financial disclosure for top officials, the most comprehensive of the so-called Sunshine Laws for open government in the nation and a strict code of ethics for all state employees.
 In an interview during his Presidential bid in 1976, he was asked why he was running.
 "I compare myself to the people who were talking about becoming candidates," he told the interviewer. "In knowledge of the economy, in ability to develop programs and get them implemented, and I couldn't see anybody comparable. I saw the caliber of these people and I said, 'What the hell.' "
 In a 1981 letter to The New York Times, Mr. Shapp, sharply criticized President Ronald Reagan's sale of Awacs electronic-warfare planes to Saudi Arabia.
"It would be far more beneficial to America's future economy and to its security if the President would implement a major civilian Awacs program by beginning a war against city slums in our nation," he wrote. "Unless we soon start to cope realistically with our major internal problems, no amount of sophisticated weapons in our possession or in the hands of so-called allies will be able to stave off internal disruption."
 Mr. Shapp battled Alzheimer's for several years, said Richard Gross, a family friend.
 He is survived by his wife, Muriel; two daughters, Dolores Graham and Joanne Shapp; a son, Richard, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Japan Stocks Tumble Again After a Sharp Loss Japan Stocks Tumble Again After A Sharp Loss

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Stock prices fell again here today after closing sharply lower on Thursday, hurt by plunges on Wall Street earlier this week.
In Europe, stock markets ended with modest gains on Thursday in trading subdued by the closing of United States markets because of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
 In currency trading in Europe, the dollar made small gains in a quiet session.
At the close in Tokyo today, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 34.31 points, at 18,666.93. On Thursday, the Nikkei fell to a 10-month low, closing down 261.75 points, or 1.38 percent, at 18,701.24. It was the lowest close since Jan. 25 when the Nikkei finished at 18,648.36.
The Japanese market was closed on Wednesday for a national holiday.
In the Hong Kong market, which was one of Wednesday's biggest casualties with a drop of 4.16 percent, stocks opened strongly on Thursday, rallying 2 percent in early trading. But after profit taking and futures-related selling, the Hang Seng index closed the day up 71.83 points, or 0.84 percent, to 8,647.86.
Dealers in London, Europe's biggest market, said shares were recovering from a volatile week that saw prices plummet on fears that the United States may have to raise interest rates again to curb inflation in its booming economy.
Trading in London on Thursday was also held back by next week's announcement of the British budget, with investors reluctant to deal before the news.
The Paris market was among the main gainers in Europe, as traders were relieved that Wall Street closed with only small losses Wednesday after Tuesday's sharp slide.
"A lot of people had expected Wall Street to keep going down, so there was a bit of short-covering on the bourse," said one French trader.
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 9.1 points higher at 3,036.6. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished up 41.59 at 1,934.68.
a dull day with modest gains. A main event was a 21 percent drop in the price of Metallgesellschaft stock. The 30-share DAX index closed up 22.66 at 2,055.97.
In Canada, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index was up 36.96 points, to 4,085.56, ending five days of losses.
The dollar slumbered quietly through the European session with volume minimal because of the Thanksgiving holiday.
The dollar stood at 1.5585 German marks and 98.43 Japanese yen in late European trading, compared with 1.5535 marks and 98.35 yen in Europe on Wednesday and 1.5520 marks and 98.35 yen in New York.
Gold closed at $384.45 an ounce in London, compared with $385.15 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Germans in Tax Revolt Embrace Luxembourg

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LUXEMBOURG

 BODY:
This tiny country nestled between France, Germany and Belgium may be best known for its castles, vineyards, rolling hills and stone-etched capital perched above a meandering river. But to the German Government, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has become a royal thorn in the side.
Since 1993, when the Finance Ministry in Bonn imposed a 30 percent withholding tax on interest income for residents, Germans by the thousands have used Luxembourg to carry out a quiet but powerful tax revolt. 
 Carrying suitcases and plastic bags of cash, they have deposited $150 billion in Luxembourg bank accounts, placing it beyond the reach of the tax authorities in Bonn, and behind the screen of Luxembourg's rigid bank secrecy laws. During the last two years, German Government officials estimate that they have lost $15 billion in tax revenues.
So much money has flooded into this country of 390,000 that Luxembourg is now the world's seventh-largest banking center, in terms of assets under management, and the fourth-largest center for mutual funds. Switzerland remains the largest private banking center, because of its long history of enforcing bank secrecy laws that make investments almost impossible to trace.
"Historically, many Germans obviously did not report their interest income to the tax office, and for a long time nobody in the Government really cared for that matter," said Klaus Tjaden, managing director of Commerzbank's offices here. After the German high court supported the fair taxation of interest income, he said, the German Government introduced a withholding tax that many Germans felt was not applicable abroad.
For nearly two years, Germany's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, has urged Luxembourg to plug this tax loophole, suggesting that the duchy impose a tax on nonresidents' interest payments as a way of encouraging Germans to move their money back home.
Mr. Waigel has proposed to the Council of European Finance Ministers in Brussels that European member governments should require banks to tell government tax offices about interest payments to individuals -- much as banks do in the United States -- and give European tax collectors the authority to share information.
It is a proposal that bankers here feel will not get very far, because Britain opposes it and most European countries have a tradition of keeping the identity of their bank clients secret, especially from other governments.
Mr. Waigel has proposed that banks and other custody institutions throughout the European Union withhold 30 percent on all interest payments. Families with interest income of less than $8,000 a year are exempt from withholding taxes. But because Germans are big savers and many earn above the minimum, and because many feared Bonn would lower the $8,000 level, wealthy, middle-class and working-class depositors have moved their money out.
Luxembourg had the tailor-made investment vehicle for them, in mark-denominated money-market mutual funds. That meant most of the funds returned immediately to the German economy without affecting the monetary policy of the Bundesbank or driving up interest rates.
The German tax revolt shows how overtaxed some Germans feel and how they are looking for new ways to avoid paying more. Families with incomes of $100,000 now pay more than 50 percent in taxes.
In the five years since the reunification of East and West Germany, West Germans have paid more than $400 billion in extra taxes to rebuild the eastern part of the country and provide a social safety net for their less affluent eastern brethren. In 1995 the tax burden will rise another 7.5 percent to continue paying for reunification, which some economists estimate will cost Germans close to $800 billion by 2000.
Lately, public patience has seemed to wear thin and economists have warned that such high rates of tax pose a drag on the country's efficiency and innovation.
But the tensions with Luxembourg go beyond taxes. They underline what many here see as the arrogance of Germany toward its smaller neighbors on economic matters. Bankers in both countries say Mr. Waigel's proposals to withhold money and report it to local government officials is flawed.
"For a decade, our position was not to enter any debate on taxes," said Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's Minister of Finance, Budget and Labor. "But I made the decision to enter this debate because we have a strong argument."
If Luxembourg capitulates, Mr. Juncker said, and even if all European Union countries adopt similar laws requiring banks to report to local tax authorities the interest paid to clients, Germans would move their money to other countries like Switzerland and Monaco that do not belong to the European Union, or to territories exempt from its rules, like the Channel Islands of Britain or Gibraltar.
"The money would leave within weeks," Mr. Juncker said. "You would have to get European-wide cooperation, which is next to impossible."
But Germany is making clear to its own banks, many of which have subsidiaries here and admit to having received deposits from German nationals, that it will go to extreme measures to stop tax evasion.
In December 1993 German tax authorities raided the Dusseldorf offices of the Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-largest financial institution, taking away boxes of files and accusing Dresdner of setting up a scheme to help Germans evade taxes. The raid sent shock waves through the German banking community.
Luxembourg bankers say the German Government is spreading the word that it has the names of many German depositors in Dresdner's Luxembourg office and will be calling on them for payment.
"German bankers say they are now losing customers because they fear their names might be somewhere on the books in the bank's offices in Germany," said Lucien Thiel, general manager of the Luxembourg Bankers Association. "People are now going more and more to Luxembourg banks where they are sure they are beyond the reach of German authorities."
Mr. Tjaden of Commerzbank acknowledged that Germans occasionally used non-German banks, preferably those of Luxembourg origin. But, he said, "Germans want to talk to German bankers here," adding, "They prefer them because they know their attitudes, their products and their language."
Bankers in Luxembourg and Germany bristle at the thought of acting as the enforcement agent for Bonn's tax collectors, even though they acknowledge that most German deposits are in Luxembourg for tax reasons.
"People think they are overtaxed and so they are looking at every way possible to avoid paying taxes," said a banking lobbyist in Bonn who insisted on anonymity. "We assume that if people deposit their money in Luxembourg, they will pay taxes. If they don't, that is a political problem for the Government, not the banks. We are not policemen."

HEADLINE: Russian Aid Under Siege By G.O.P.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Aid to Russia, always a contentious issue before Congress, is under siege by the new Republican majority, even though President Clinton has already cut Russian aid sharply from last year.
The two Republican Senators who are expected to be the most influential voices on foreign assistance -- Jesse Helms of North Carolina, in line to head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is likely to run the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Operations -- have repeatedly suggested that aid to Russia is too generous and vow to take an even tougher line next year. 
 Both Senators criticized the $1.6 billion appropriated to Russia last year -- a sizable chunk of which remains unspent -- saying that it unduly favored Russia over other former Soviet republics.
They plan to examine more closely the approximately $700 million in aid planned for Russia this year -- $400 million in economic aid and the rest to help dismantle Russia's nuclear weapons. Some Senate aides say the new Republican majority might even cut back some money already appropriated to Russia and perhaps channel it to other former Soviet republics.
"You'll see a continued effort to change the Administration's Russia First approach," said Mr. McConnell in an interview. While praising the Administration for trimming Russian aid, he suggested that he might want even deeper cuts.
As for Mr. Helms, he wants aid to be in the form of loans, not grants. Not only that, in a proposal that some Administration officials say is ill-conceived, he added that Russia should provide collateral for such loans by giving the United States rights to its chrome, diamonds and natural gas.
But Administration officials warn that if Congress makes deeper cuts it could strain relations with Russia and push the many nationalists in Russia's Parliament to turn against the United States.
Moreover, they say aid to Russia has been cut not because of unhappiness with President Boris N. Yeltsin, but because there is a sense that Russia's economic and social crisis has abated.
President Clinton committed $1.6 billion in aid to Russia last year when its economy was on the verge of collapse and Mr. Yeltsin was about to embark on unpopular and painful reforms. For Mr. Clinton, this aid was also a symbol of support for Mr. Yeltsin when he was being battered by right and left.
With Russia's economy seeming to have bottomed out, Administration officials now see less need for American aid, especially since the flow of funds from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund has increased.
Some officials acknowledge another reason for the drop in Russian aid: intense criticism from Congressional Republicans last year that Mr. Clinton was tilting too heavily in favor of Russia at the expense of other Republics. Last year, aid to Russia represented two-thirds of the aid to the former Soviet Union, while this year aid to Russia will account for less than half.
"It's no longer a Russia First package," Brian Atwood, director of the Agency for International Development, said in an interview. "If we don't help Russia through this economic transition, we're going to have to worry a lot about the future."
The Administration hopes that Mr. Helms's and Mr. McConnell's impulse to cut Russian aid will be offset by fellow Republicans who look more charitably on such an expenditure. Two of them are Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, who is in line to head the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Representative John Porter of Illinois, favorite to head the House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations.
Taking sharp issue with Mr. Helms, Representative Porter said in an interview: "Russia is very key. The money we invest now in building a democratic free-market Russia will pay dividends to us long into the future. If Russia doesn't become a democratic, free-market nation, it could cost us hundreds of billions of dollars on defense spending in the future."
In addition, Mr. Atwood pointed out that Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Speaker in waiting, supported last year's $2.4 billion aid package for the former Soviet republics on the ground that it was crucial to help them become free-market democracies.
At Congressional hearings over the past year, Mr. Helms has suggested that aid to Russia was ineffective because it did not stop nationalists and Communists from winning a majority in parliamentary elections.
He also asserted that Moscow was using some aid money to underwrite military operations to build a sphere of influence in bordering nations. The Clinton Administration said that, to the best of its knowledge, this was not the case.

HEADLINE: Kazakhstan Thanks U.S. On Uranium

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Officials in Kazakhstan expressed gratitude today to the United States for taking control of some 1,300 pounds of enriched uranium, but they sought to emphasize that the material had not been at risk of theft or diversion to a dangerous power.
Clinton Administration officials have said they arranged the transfer to the United States because they feared that if the material was left in the former Soviet republic, some of it might find its way to Iran, Iraq, North Korea or some other nation. 
 "The fact that the United States took it to keep it from going to a third country may have been one of their motivations," said a Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister, Vladimir L. Mette, the former director of a metallurgical combine in eastern Kazakhstan that made some of the material. "But it had been here for 20 years, and we could keep it for 20 more."
Mr. Mette spoke at a news conference here in Almaty, the Kazakh capital.
The extraordinarily secret transfer of the material from a nuclear fuel-fabrication plant in eastern Kazakhstan was completed on Wednesday when the last shipment arrived at a plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Asked by Kazakh journalists whether the country had received enough aid from the United States in recompense, Mr. Mette said it had been more profitable to hand over the material to the Americans than to use it. He confirmed that the total compensation to Kazakhstan would be in the low tens of millions of dollars, saying, "It's more than $10 million but not many tens of millions."
Kazakhstan is to receive part of the compensation in cash, he said, and part in specialized equipment, including analytical equipment for factories like the fuel-production plant at Ust-Kamenogorsk and medical equipment for two cities. He said the final list would be drafted after a group of American experts visited Kazakhstan in early December.
The country's Foreign Minister, Kasimzhomart Tokayev, argued that the real importance of the transfer for Kazakhstan was not economic. "We acted as a state that has joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, that understands its responsibilities in the world and that wanted to remove the risk of proliferation," he said.
Kazakh officials also confirmed today that the deal had been coordinated with the Russian Government "at the highest levels," and was arranged only after Moscow had refused to take the uranium or pay for it. Russia has plenty of bomb-grade uranium of its own and a significant storage problem.
But Mr. Mette stressed that only about 5 percent of the highly enriched uranium was in a form readily usable for nuclear weapons, while the rest was a combination of alloys, composites and waste material, all of which had been in storage in eastern Kazakhstan for nearly 20 years.
He said Kazakhstan did not insist on guarantees from the United States that the material would be used for peaceful purposes. He agreed that the small percentage of bomb-grade material was dangerous and required great care, but insisted that it was properly looked after. "As for the low-enriched uranium, it's like lead or zinc and poses no real danger," he said.
Without giving a specific figure, American officials have said the 5 percent estimate is too low.
At the news conference, Mr. Mette said the uranium had been produced for the Soviet military beginning in the 1960's and ending in 1976-77. He said the material had not been produced for weapons, suggesting that it was for military reactors or possibly for submarines or enrichment installations elsewhere.
The factory, which now employs 15,000 people in Ust-Kamenogorsk, still makes nuclear fuel for civilian reactors. "But there is no more highly enriched uranium at this factory," Mr. Mette said. He said the plant was under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Vladimir S. Shkolnik, the Minister for Science and New Technologies, said Kazakhstan still had "colossal amounts" of nuclear material, but only small amounts now of highly enriched uranium or plutonium -- all of that in research laboratories, which "will be under the control of the I.A.E.A. from early next year."
As for Kazakhstan's inherited nuclear weapons -- some 1,400 warheads on 104 long-range SS-18 missiles and bombers -- Foreign Minister Tokayev said negotiations were continuing with Russia on the purchase and transport of the nuclear material in the warheads. He added that he expected Kazakhstan to become non-nuclear, as it has committed itself to do, by the end of next year. About half of the missiles have already been dismantled, American officials said.
The United States hopes to recoup some of the additional aid it has promised to Kazakhstan by turning the uranium into lower-grade fuel and selling it commercially.

HEADLINE: Inflation Figures Go Up for 68th Straight Year

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
With wind nipping at their noses and fingertips, tens of thousands of New Yorkers lined the streets of Manhattan yesterday for the 68th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Despite the chill, they roared approval at the blaring bands, prancing steeds, bulb-nosed clowns and, of course, the traditional pantheon of pumped-up heroes like Spiderman, Garfield, the Pink Panther, Snoopy, and, making his debut, Barney the dinosaur.
 Bundled like Inuits on an ice floe, children sat cross-legged under police barricades or atop phone booths. One youngster stole a perch on a story-high ladder behind the 10-deep crowd. And some, their enthusiasm chilled a bit by temperatures in the upper 20's, still managed to wave as the clowns scampered about. 
 Two-year-old Sapir Dana, ensconced in her stroller, brushed off her father's offer of mittens so that she could alternately stuff cookies into her mouth and blow kisses to the clowns. "I put on the gloves, she takes them off," Eli Dana said with a shrug.
 One media-savvy youngster, Cara Forte, 9, of Glen Oaks, Queens, knew a photo opportunity when she spotted one. "Yo, camera, camera, come here!" Cara shouted as a TV crew came within earshot.
 Moments later, the Mobile Azalea Trail Maids -- 60 southern belles in six-foot-wide, assorted pastel hoop skirts, bonnets and parasols -- bobbed by like a grand bouquet of buttercups.
 Wary of collisions on such a windy day, parade organizers had lowered several street lights and traffic signals along the way -- at 43d Street in Times Square, for example, where the parade route took a sudden jog east as Seventh Avenue crossed Broadway.
 Sonic the Hedgehog, a 64-foot balloon that smashed into a light pole last year, negotiated the jog without mishap, its handlers, two to a rope, leaning into the wind.
 This year, collisions left the Nestle's Quik Bunny with a droopy ear and Snoopy with a flat foot; Barney hit a lamppost and tore a hole in his side near the end of the route, while another newcomer, the Cat in the Hat ended up with a deflated paw.
 Most of the balloons bobbed and weaved in the brisk breeze -- seeming to bow before the throngs on one side, then the other -- the crowd repeatedly roared, "Whoa!!!"
 And as a behemoth of a Saint Bernard bounced by, one wag toward the back of the pack shouted, "Roll over, Beethoven."
 One pink-wigged clown, Jennifer Field, 24, of Manhattan, said the best part was "playing with the kids." Ms. Field said she had pulled strings even beforehand to get the job. "My stepmother knows one of the Macy's vice presidents," she confided.
 Ms. Field acknowledged there were some hazards to the clowning around. "We almost stepped into the horse stuff," she noted.
 Preceding Ms. Field in the procession was a troop of mounted police officers. And try as they would, the four city sanitation workers with scoops and buckets on wheels who followed behind did not always pick up the trail, so to speak. The crowd offered those intrepid toilers some of its lustiest cheers.
 Through it all, the wind and the thermometer took their toll.
 Richard Auz, 26, a college student from Norwalk, Conn., was one of the handlers of the big Barney balloon. Yes, he said, you can be hoisted off your feet a bit "if the wind pulls it back." But holding onto one of the ropes was also a good way to weather the chill. "You work up a good sweat doing this," Mr. Auz said.
 One of Mr. Auz's partners holding the purple dinosaur in tow was Mike Dean, 34, of Saratoga, N.Y. "I'm going after Giuliani in the next election," Mr. Dean said, "because if I can handle all this hot air, I can easily be Mayor of New York."
 Jill Womack, a bugler with the Atlanta Olympic Band, held her gloved hand around the mouthpiece of her horn, intermittently blowing on it. "We hold them so they don't freeze," Ms. Womack said. "We just hope our tongues don't stick to them."
 Billy Hansen, 9, was there with his 5-year-old brother, Douglas, and his parents, Michelle and Jack Hansen of Sherman, Conn. Billy had come prepared. "I've got two pair of pants, a turtleneck and long johns," Billy said. And there was a ski cap pulled down to the top rim of his glasses.
 "It's too cold," said Douglas, his teeth chattering and his nose doing what red noses do.
 Then, right at the end, a red-suited fellow glided by, apparently unaffected by the weather, perhaps fresh from joyful toil in more frigid climes.

HEADLINE: Europeans Follow U.S. Shift to Bonds, for Now

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Like their counterparts in the United States, investors in European markets have been bailing out of stocks this week and putting their money into bonds.
But the economic fundamentals behind the European markets are considerably different from those at play in the United States. And while investors and analysts here said Europe would continue to be influenced by what happens on Wall Street, some said there are still selected opportunities for equity market gains in France, Britain, Germany and other markets. 
 "The European markets are following the U.S., but probably should not be," said Albert B. Morillo, the director of European investments at Scottish Widows Investment Management, a large British pension fund. "The dynamics are different. We are still in the initial phases of a period of reasonable upswing in economic activity."
With the American markets closed today, European markets recovered to varying degrees after their big losses on Wednesday.
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed up 9.1 points at 3,036.60. German shares closed up in extremely light trading, with the DAX index in Frankfurt rising 22.66 to 2,055.97. In Paris, the CAC 40 index jumped 41.59 points to 1,934.68
The timing and strength of Europe's economic recovery differs from country to country, with Britain a year or so behind the United States cycle, and Germany and most other nations on the Continent two years behind.
While the Federal Reserve has been pushing interest rates aggressively higher in the United States since February, raising fears that economic and earnings growth could be choked off, Germany's powerful Bundesbank has continued to cut rates this year. The Bundesbank left rates unchanged after a policy meeting today, but its chairman, Hans Tietmeyer, has left open the possibility of a further reduction.
Among the major European nations, only Britain, Sweden and Italy have raised rates this year to head off inflation, which remains at extremely low levels, especially in Germany.
Although economic growth in most European countries rebounded more strongly earlier this year than many economists had expected, the recovery remains patchy, with few signs of increased employment, wage increases or rising consumer demand.
But at the same time, many big European companies are reaping the benefits of cost-cutting programs, with earnings rebounding sharply. Today, for example, the German chemicals company BASF, a traditionally cyclical stock whose fortunes improve with economic growth, said its third-quarter pretax profit had more than quadrupled, to 526 million marks (about $340 million), from the corresponding period a year earlier.
"In the U.S. you could argue for a scenario where there's a slowdown in earnings, where in Europe we still have the possibility of earnings recoveries," Mr. Morillo said.
The European markets, however, are being unsettled to some degree by the same shift from equities into bonds that has been driving activity on Wall Street this week.
On Wall Street, stock prices had remained relatively strong until this week, while the bond markets in the United States had collapsed when the Fed began raising rates. In Europe, stock prices have been tumbling all year along with bond prices. In London and Frankfurt, the markets have fallen nearly 10 percent this year, while the Paris market is down 16 percent. Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds in Germany, France, Britain and other countries are all up between half a point and more than a point in the last six months.
In the last several months, though, investors in Europe have taken a new look at bond valuations, and that could spell a little trouble for stock markets. The investors began deciding that with inflation low and economic growth moderate, the selloff in bonds had probably gone too far, creating more buying interest.
"There is a much more positive attitude towards bonds, but I think it's largely because the market has fallen so far in price," said Stephen Hannah, the head of research at IBJ International in London. "I don't think it's a fundamental shift."
Morgan Stanley's London office recommended on Wednesday that clients reduce their European equity holdings to 50 percent of their portfolios from 58 percent and move the funds into bonds.
Joe Rooney, the investment strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, said he had been telling clients since the end of June to move to an overweighted position in bonds.
Cyclical European stocks, like chemical and construction companies, performed well earlier this year because they rose on the hopes for a rebound in European economies. But Mr. Rooney now thinks that they are overvalued and that financial stocks, like banks, may now be a better bet.
"It's difficult to see how sentiment towards equities could get any worse," he said.
Mike Young, the director of European investment strategy at Merrill Lynch in London, said that with 10-year bond yields 2.1 times the dividend on equities in Germany, 1.9 times in Britain, 2.2 times in France and 5 times in Italy, it was not surprising that funds were flowing into bonds.
"There's still another step of relative outperformance of cyclical stocks in Europe because we think people will be surprised at how strong the earnings recovery will be in cyclicals," Mr. Young said. "Having said that, the general outlook for the market is not all that great. The next step in bonds and equities could well be down in terms of asset prices, but many people would prefer to be in bonds because the high coupon in many markets allows you to overcome the capital decline relatively quickly."

HEADLINE: U.S. Study Shows Half of Food-Stamp Recipients Are Children

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
As House Republicans push a plan for changing the welfare system that includes dismantling Federal nutrition programs, the Clinton Administration has issued a new study showing that half of the food stamp recipients are children in poverty.
The Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Service, which runs the Government's largest nutrition programs, released the study this week as the debate intensified over the Republican proposal. 
 Republicans preparing to take control of the House want to consolidate several nutrition programs for the poor -- including food stamps, school lunches and the supplemental feeding program for women, infants and children -- and give the money to the states in a lump sum.
Under their plan, spending on nutrition assistance would be limited, and low-income families would no longer be automatically entitled to receive benefits.
Republican lawmakers say that their proposal would end duplication among programs and give the states greater flexibility to distribute aid for food to poor families. The block grant would save $11 billion over five years, they say.
Advocates for the poor say the plan, if it becomes law, could lead to increased hunger and homelessness among American families because spending could not grow automatically in times of recession and rising poverty.
They also say families could be taken off the welfare rolls or put in waiting lines for benefits. They seized on the new study to make their case that the Republican plan would hit children, the elderly and the working poor especially hard.
"This underscores how heavily targeted the Republican welfare reform plan will fall on children, including very poor and often very hungry children," said Robert J. Fersh, president of the Food Research and Action Center, an advocacy group in Washington.
The Agriculture Department report, dated Oct. 27 and released this week without any comment from the Administration, profiled the population that receives food stamps in the summer of 1993.
The program then served an average of 27.3 million people in almost 11 million households. More than half of the people in the program, 51.4 percent, were children. Seven percent were elderly, and the rest were adults ages 18 to 59.
The study found that food stamps were about a fourth of a family's total income. The average benefit per household was $170 a month.
The study also found that a fifth of the families receiving food stamps were working, but not earning enough to escape poverty.
Darold Johnson, deputy director for programs and policy at the Children's Defense Fund, said the block grant was a bad idea because it replaced coupons, which must be used to purchase food, with cash, which could be used for other purposes like rent and utilities.
"The decision between heating and eating is one that low-income families make constantly," he said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
For Stocks, New Fears Of a Slowing Economy

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The stock market is suddenly becoming worried about the health of the economy.
The plunge in prices this month, and particularly in the last few days, has hit the cyclical stocks -- the issues most dependent on a strong economy -- the hardest. At the same time, the battered bond market has suddenly gained strength. 
 "What the cyclical stocks are telling us is that a slowdown is imminent," said Ed Goldfarb, a strategist at Aeltus Investment Management. "I think that is what broke the back of the market this week, without any real confirming economic data."
Whether the plunge continues, or mimics this year's earlier slides and reverses, depends in part on whether investors return from the Thanksgiving holiday less pessimistic about the economy. A string of important economic data next week, including reports on the gross domestic product, unemployment, factory orders and the leading indicators, might help convince them that they overreacted.
So far this month, the Morgan Stanley index of cyclical stocks has plunged 10.4 percent, while a similar measure of consumer stocks -- companies that make products far less sensitive to overall economic data -- has slipped just 1.2 percent. During the same stretch, the Dow Jones industrial average has lost 6 percent, including a fall of 4.4 percent in the last five trading days, all of which have seen the index fall.
"What you have seen is fear that the economy is headed into a recession," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chair of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "There has been a notable rotation away from stocks whose earnings are economically sensitive."
For much of the last two years, cyclical stocks led the stock market. Their strength predated most economists' discovery that the economy was growing surprisingly strongly.
Now they are turning down, reflecting worry that the Federal Reserve, which has raised short-term interest rates six times this year, will go too far. The most recent rise was last week, when the Fed pushed up the rates that banks pay on overnight loans from other banks by 75 basis points, or three-quarters of a percentage point.
"With the move to 75 basis points by the Fed, in effect what they are telling us is that 'we're going to do whatever it takes to dampen your enthusiasm about the economy,' " said Robert Barbera, an economic consultant in Greenwich, Conn.
The stock market has long had a reputation for getting spooked about the economy whether such a mood was wise or not; one of Professor Paul Samuelson's most famous remarks was to note that the stock market had forecast many more recessions than had actually occurred. And there are few indications that business is in danger of seriously slowing.
That is one reason some analysts, including Mrs. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs, view the current plunge in prices as a buying opportunity and suggest that investors will grow more encouraged when they see that the economy and corporate profits will not falter significantly next year.
One of the stock market's great strengths since 1988 has been the willingness of individual investors, particularly mutual fund buyers, to view dips as buying opportunities, rather than as cause for panic. While stock fund buyers have been losing enthusiasm, so far there is no sign of a widespread run for the exits.
But Byron Wien, the chief United States equity strategist for Morgan Stanley, predicts that a change may be coming. On Monday, just before the worst part of the plunge, he recommended that all-stock portfolios raise their cash levels to 15 percent, from 3 percent.
He pointed to evidence that households may not have enough spare cash to keep up the flow in any case, and added that he feared the Dow would fall below 3,600 and the redemptions, or withdrawals from mutual funds, would start.
"The most important secular event" of this market cycle, he said, "has been the zeal of the public for equity mutual funds." Unfortunately, he added, "the market rarely rewards zeal of that intensity."
In the last decade, the public has put a net $300 billion into stock mutual funds, and during that stretch the Dow industrials have tripled, from 1,200. But most of that money has come in during the last two years.
Most of the recent buyers now show little if any profit, and it is possible that some will flee if the losses begin to mount.
The biggest and most-watched averages, including the Dow industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500, have stayed within relatively narrow trading ranges this year, and have yet to break below them. The lows for the Dow and the S.& P. are about 2 percent lower than current levels.
But other less-watched indexes have done much worse. The more economically sensitive Dow Jones transportation average, composed of airlines, railroads and trucking companies, fell on Wednesday to its lowest level since Dec. 16, 1992, and is down 23.6 percent from its peak in early February. By contrast, the Dow industrials are only 7.6 percent off their high, set a couple of days earlier.
The Dow Jones utility average, which is dominated by electric utilities and is highly sensitive to interest rates, has done even worse. On Tuesday, it closed at 173.94, its lowest level since 1988 and down 32.2 percent since its peak in the fall of 1993. But that index came roaring back on Wednesday, rising 2 percent, to 177.50.
That recovery reflected the new optimism about interest rates that had accompanied the recent slide in stocks. Valuation models now generally indicate that bonds are a better buy than stocks, and consequently some big traders seem to have moved money to bonds from stocks.
A belief that the economy was slowing would tend to buoy the bond market, by making further Fed tightening less likely and by reducing the demand for credit.
The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds peaked earlier this month at 8.16 percent, and has since fallen to 7.94 percent. Bond investors, reeling from bad news for most of the year, are suddenly making money.
In what is still a minority opinion on Wall Street, Chuck Clough, chief strategist at Merrill Lynch, argues that after a long string of positive earnings surprises, the earnings news may be about to sour for a lot of companies, with retailers the next to be hit.
"Corporate earnings could really be in trouble," he said on Wednesday, adding that rising costs were not being passed along by many companies, and further that with adjustable-rate mortgages gaining in popularity the effects of the Fed's tightening were starting to be felt by many consumers.
"That will probably be the biggest surprise of all," he said.

HEADLINE: Plan for Toxic Dump Off Coney I. Is Attacked

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Rebuffed in its bid to dump 150,000 tons of dioxin-tainted sand in the ocean six miles off Sandy Hook, N.J., the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is considering a plan to deposit the material in a pit a half mile off Coney Island.
 Residents of Coney Island and Staten Island have begun letter-writing and petition drives against the plan and nearly 300 people showed up at a recent protest meeting in Sheepshead Bay. Community Board 3, which oversees most of Staten Island's recreational beaches, has passed a motion condemning the plan. And fisherman say the area around the pit is teeming with fish that could be poisoned, destroying the catch of charter boats and commercial fisherman, many of whom sell at the Fulton Fish Market. 
 "If they go ahead and dump, the fleet there might as well pack it in and sell their boats," said Ralph Pastore, director of the 8,500-member United Fishermen's Association of New York.
 Environmentalists, including opponents of the plan, say the major danger would be to people eating the fish and clams poisoned through the food chain.
 Officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Army Corps of Engineers believe the concerns are ill-founded. They say the plan has been carefully evaluated and is not only safe but will actually encase contaminants that already pollute New York Harbor.
 The proposal is just a first, interim step in a long quest to dredge up to seven million tons of sediment a year from 32 sites in the harbor and its estuaries by the end of the century to open sea lanes that are too shallow for the deep-hulled cargo vessels that now ply the seas. Both sides in the dispute agree that opening up the harbor to deep-hulled vessels is essential to restoring economic vitality to what was once one of the world's premier cargo ports.
 "It's a worthy goal, and I understand that," said Assemblyman Daniel L. Feldman, Democrat of Brooklyn, a leader in the fight to find another solution. "But I'm more than a little concerned about this potential poisoning of my constituents."
 Peter Shugert, a spokesman for the Corps of Engineers, which would oversee the operation, said he understands that "this is an emotional issue," because dioxins are involved. But, he said: "We've gotten to the point where we've got to apply something. After a careful and exhaustive scientific search, this is one proposal that we feel is solid, that works."
 Immediately at issue is what to do with the 152,000 tons of sediment the Port Authority wants to dredge from Howland Hook, a long-dormant marine terminal facing the Arthur Kill on the northwest shore of Staten Island. Howland Hook has long been a repository for a dioxin-laced byproduct dumped into the nearby Passaic River during 25 years of Agent Orange production by the defunct Diamond Shamrock Corporation.
 The 187-acre site was supposed to have been deepened, from 31 feet to about 40 feet, so ships could start docking there by the end of the year. The sediment was to be deposited in what is called the Mud Dump, a Federally regulated site off Sandy Hook. But last week, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency barred the use of the Mud Dump after tests determined that the Howland Hook sediments fall into category 3, the highest level of toxicity.
 In a statement released last Tuesday after the E.P.A. test results were announced, the director of the Port Authority's port department, Lillian C. Liburdi, said the authority is looking for an alternate dumping site in what is called a "borrow pit" -- a pit that is the product of previous sand-mining operations. She said the pit should be "in the floor of coastal waters where the material could be isolated and capped with a thick layer of protective material."
 One of the largest borrow pits in the harbor, and the one suggested by the Port Authority with the approval of the Corps of Engineers, is East Bank Pit No. 6 -- a squiggle-shaped, 70-foot-deep, one-and-a half-mile-long gouge in the sea bottom, a half mile south of Sea Gate on Coney Island. On its western side, the pit slopes toward Staten Island's beaches, three miles away.
 On Wednesday, the executive director of the Port Authority, Stanley Brezenoff, said: "We believe firmly that borrow pits are environmentally safe, technologically sound and, therefore, an alternative that has to be one of several things available to us for the disposal of dredged material. We have consistently said that, as a public agency, we would not promote anything that was harmful to the environment."
 In her statement, Ms. Liburdi also said, "We must not allow a dispute over trace levels of contaminants to jeopardize a project of great significance to the Port of New York and New Jersey."
 Environmentalists and opponents of the plan are troubled by Ms. Liburdi's use of the phrase, "trace levels."
 "Trace doesn't mean trivial," Assemblyman Feldman said.
 Dr. Angela Cristini, a professor of biology at Ramapo College and a member of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's Dredge Management Team, said: "People at the Port Authority talk about trace amounts, but they are used to dealing with millions of tons. As a biologist, I know that the cells in our body deal in parts per trillion or even quadrillion. That's not very much, and not very much can cause a problem."
 Dioxin is actually a group of about 200 closely related chemical compounds considered the most potent of all the human-made carcinogens. It accumulates in body fat over a lifetime, gradually increasing the risk of cancer, scientists say. And it mimicks hormones, which can lead to birth defects.
 Dr. Barry Commoner, director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College, said the E.P.A. regards 1 to 10 in a million as an acceptable risk that a person might get cancer during his or her lifetime from general exposure to the environment. Dioxin, by itself, the E.P.A. has determined, poses a risk of 500 to 1000 in a million.
 The Port Authority maintains that because the material will be dumped at sea and capped, there is little, if any, danger that residents of surrounding areas will be directly exposed to dioxins. Their proposal calls for capping the contaminants from Howland Hook with a 3-foot-deep layer of sand.
 "What should comfort the people of Coney Island and environmentalists," said Mr. Shugert, the Corps of Engineers spokesman, "is the fact that this material will be isolated from the environment that it comes in contact with now."
 Mr. Shugert said capping the sediment with three feet of sand "is a technique used throughout the country that is endorsed by all the Federal agencies." Opponents contended that a storm could breach the sand-cap. "That hasn't been proven," Mr. Shugert said.
 Other alternatives have been proposed. "The only safe way is to seal it in something like a concrete enclosure," Mr. Commoner said. Construction of bulkheaded containment islands in Lower New York Bay is another possibility, Mr. Shugert said.
 Dr. Cristini suggested digging a pit out of the clay bottom in parts of Newark Bay, with the clay used to form a more stable cap. But to deal with the long-term problem of handling the vast amounts of material that must be dredged from the harbor, a combination of solutions is needed, she said, including construction of plants that chemically decontaminate the sediment.
 "You can either use that sand for landfill," Dr. Cristini said, "or dump it in the ocean without any problem."

HEADLINE: Flexing Fiscal Muscles: Mayor and Council at Loggerheads

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
For 11 months, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has had near total dominion at City Hall, with the Democratic-controlled City Council resignedly giving its approval to the Republican's austere $31.6 billion budget and vision of a far smaller government.
 But now a slow accumulation of citizen pressure over continuing spending cuts, legislative grievances over Mr. Giuliani's all-or-nothing style, and a sense that the Mayor has become vulnerable in the wake of the election of George E. Pataki as Governor have started to change the relationship between Mr. Giuliani and the 51-member Council. 
 In one defiant day, the Council displayed its independence on Wednesday by voting with a vetoproof margin to create a permanent outside agency to monitor police corruption over Mr. Giuliani's objections. It also moved to test the limits of its fiscal powers by voting to restore to the budget funds that the Mayor had intended to cut -- money to care for the mentally retarded, to keep open emergency soup kitchens and to prevent deeper reductions in teachers and school supplies.
 What happens now that the Council has tried to substitute its own spending priorities for the Mayor's is far from clear. The two sides might yet negotiate an agreement, the Council having demonstrated that it can flex its muscles. Or the vote could end in a court test of the balance of power between the two branches of government when it comes to setting fiscal policy. Mr. Giuliani, who started out on Wednesday saying a midyear Council budget vote violated the City Charter and would be "null and void," unexpectedly bought time for compromise after the vote against him by saying he would wait five days, then veto the budget measure.
 But whatever the outcome, Wednesday's two votes were warning signs to the Mayor that the support he will need in the Council to carry out his program is eroding as he nears his second year in office. In fact, despite the last-minute lobbying of Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, six of the seven Republicans on the Council defied the Mayor and joined with the Democratic Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, on the budget vote to send their own message of independence.
 "It's always the Council that acquiesces, and I think that somewhere along the line you have to become assertive, and I understood Speaker Vallone's position," said Councilman Thomas V. Ognibene, the Queens Republican who became minority leader this week by deposing Michael J. Abel, who had been installed earlier in the year with the help of the Mayor.
 In part, Mr. Giuliani's loss of support stems from his style. In his first year in office, Mr. Giuliani has shown streaks of political brilliance, especially in his ability to reach out and communicate to constituents with the right political message and sound bite. He was already at work on Wednesday after his legislative defeat depicting the Council as "irresponsible" and profligate.
 "It's really an attempt not to make the difficult decision," said Mr. Giuliani at Gracie Mansion. "I would have preferred the City Council to act as partners, but they didn't seem to be up to it."
 But in the equally important realm of back-room politics with fellow elected officials, Mr. Giuliani's tendency to try to crush any opposition is starting to carry costs, just as his furious campaign against Mr. Pataki left many in his own party determined to pay him back.
 "He mustn't constantly take the position that it's my way or the highway," said Councilman Anthony D. Weiner, a Brooklyn Democrat, reflecting widespread sentiment among Democrats and Republicans alike.
 The Mayor's aides have often said that only by being focused and unyielding will they be able to change the direction of a city largely dominated by Democrats. Mr. Giuliani's face-off with Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines won him the budget cuts he wanted in the spring. And his threat to cut off funds for the Legal Aid Society brought striking lawyers back to work this fall.
 But many Council members said they thought the Mayor had shown contempt for them when -- in his search for ways to deal with a more than $1 billion gap that had opened in the budget -- he cut out $40 million of the $75 million in programs that the Council had restored to his budget during negotiations in June. It was those very programs that had allowed Mr. Vallone, a conservative Democrat who shares many of Mr. Giuliani's own priorities, to assemble enough votes to pass the budget. "That is an in-your-face move," Mr. Vallone complained.
 Beyond its anger at the Mayor, the Council was responding to its own political needs. In pressing for the monitoring agency, Mr. Vallone knew that a strong stand against police corruption was an important priority for the 22 black and Hispanic members of the Council as the last few years have brought revelations of rogue bands of police officers abusing citizens and shaking down drug dealers.
 In addition, lawmakers said that with the second round of budget cuts presented to them by the Mayor, they were starting to hear many protests not just from advocates for the poor but also from middle-class constituents worried about more cuts for their schools or uncertain how they would be able to cope with a severely retarded or developmentally disabled child if government programs disappeared.
 "How Dickensian do we want this city to become?" asked Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, a Manhattan Democrat, as she voted for the Council's alternative budget plan.
 Despite the Council's show of defiance, there was little sign that the Democrats, as loath as Mr. Giuliani to raise taxes, had come up with a coherent long-term plan to deal with the multibillion-dollar deficits looming for years to come.
 While the Council made alternative budget cuts to pay for the programs it restored, many of the cuts seemed intended to pique Mr. Giuliani. The Council proposed slashing much of the Mayor's own staff, as well as lawyers in the Corporation Counsel's office and the Department of Investigation, and called for big reductions in overtime pay for police, firefighters and sanitation workers.
 But simply estimating that the overtime cost will be millions of dollars less than it has traditionally been will not necessarily result in savings, but more likely in a deficit that will have to be addressed later in the year. The Mayor's budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, referred to the Council's alternative budget cuts as "Alice in Wonderland." And the administration pointed out that the Council had cut not one penny from its own budget.
 Serene in the almost unrivaled power that the City Charter grants the Mayor to manage fiscal affairs once a city budget is enacted, Mr. Giuliani said this week that, if need be, he would cut from the $31.6 billion budget on his own to prevent a gap. "If I have to do it alone, I'll do it alone," he said.
 But come next year when he has to win Council approval for his second budget, that approach won't suffice.

Revisiting the World Of Rebels and Redcoats

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Let's get the invidious comparisons out of the way. "The American Revolution" is not "The Civil War." Momentous though it was, the war that began the United States does not grip the imagination like the war that might have ended it. For 20th-century Americans, the Revolution does not have the dramatic force, the emotional resonance, the painful relevance of the Civil War, and the six-hour history that begins on Sunday does not pretend otherwise.
What "The American Revolution" does do is trace the background, dramatize the high moments and sketch some of the personalities and achievements of the remarkable company that gave us the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and political ideals that have never lost their glow. 
 In the absence of contributions by Matthew Brady, effective use is made of re-enacted battle scenes -- red coats against motley -- with plenty of smoke and commotion; drawings and paintings are melded into the tale. At times the screen seems transparent and the motion is often slow as historical figures (David Warner doing George III) flow in and out like ghosts. The resident historians seem like analysts of a dream as they offer their nonrevolutionary interpretations.
Sunday's two hours open with, yes, the ride of Paul Revere, and the first fatal encounter between British troops and American militiamen at Lexington, Mass. "Somehow," a historian says, "someone fired a shot and started a war." There are introductions to those great American agitators Samuel Adams, John Adams, Patrick Henry and Tom Paine, whose resounding words put today's political sound-biters to shame. And there is a look back at the French and Indian War, which freed the Americans from the threat of invasion by France and so allowed them to concentrate on ridding themselves of the British, and which not incidentally brought to the fore George Washington (voice by Cliff Robertson).
Also mentioned, in the spirit of diversity, are Abigail Adams (encouraging husband John to give "particular care and attention to the ladies" in the new republic) and Crispus Attucks, the black man killed during the Boston Massacre. Presumably as a dash of human interest, periodic attention is given to Benjamin Franklin's bitter falling out with his Tory son, William. More deservingly, Benedict Arnold, that hero-traitor, receives special notice.
The historians do not fail to point out that despite the ringing demands for liberty, Thomas Jefferson's call for ending the slave trade was excised from the Declaration of Independence, in deference to both Southern and Northern economic interests. They also note that British rule was hardly onerous and that this was no uprising of an oppressed class, many of the American revolutionists being quite well to do.
Despite the frequent commerical breaks, this preview of the History Channel, a new 24-hour programming service that is to begin on Jan. 1, invites family watching, and teachers should find it of use in helping students envision the Boston Tea Party and remember who said, "Don't one of you fire until you see the whites of their eyes," and why. (The program credits Israel Putnam; my Bartlett's says it might have been William Prescott.)
New York City and environs figure prominently in the first episode, as the British beat the Americans from Kip's Bay to Harlem Heights to Fort Lee, N.J., to White Plains. These two hours end with General Washington's soul being tried and Valley Forge still ahead. But not to worry, things will turn around by Tuesday.

More Than Coffee
From the street, the Cake Bar and Cafe looks like just another bakery and coffee bar. Well, maybe more stylish than most with its sleek, bright, stripped-down look and shiny cases displaying delectable pastries. But there's another dimension to the Cake Bar. An excellent little menu, more ambitious than you might expect, takes the cafe from the realm of fanciful dessert to solid main course. 
 The full meals are served in a spacious, loftlike brick dining room on the second floor. With its haphazard collection of tables -- some industrial metal, some farmhouse wooden -- the room looks at first like the eclectic result of a year spent at yard sales, but closer observation reveals a quirky sensibility at work. The high ceiling is not made of pressed tin, but dozens of silver baking trays. The wall sconces are actually French aspic molds, and metal Art Nouveau vines creep along the walls. Big plate-glass windows stare down on 13th Street. Most of the tables have wooden school chairs, but at one end are tables with club chairs that make you wish you could spend a year sitting at a back table writing a dissertation.
The design and the food are the collaboration of Susan Povich, daughter of the television personality Maury Povich, and Jude Quintiere. The two met while taking classes at the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan, and the Cake Bar is their first venture. Ms. Povich handles the food, a melange of Mediterranean and American dishes, and the pies, while Mr. Quintiere prepares the pastries and cakes.
Most main courses come with a nice green salad, which makes for a most economical meal. A huge helping of couscous ($8.50), aromatic with cinnamon and cumin, is topped with strips of moist grilled chicken. A special, large ravioli stuffed with corn and sausage ($9.25), was truly special, with a wonderfully complex sauce of reduced chicken stock and pureed grapes offering a contrast to the savory filling. A juicy Cornish hen ($6.95), stuffed with sweet pork sausage and leeks, comes with a nutty wild rice pilaf flavored with orange. Ms. Povich loves sausages and makes a mean merguez ($9), served with rice and full-flavored roasted peppers. Sauteed shrimp ($9) are scented with lemon and served on a puree of split peas with an intense port wine sauce.
Lighter fare includes an unusual pissaladiere, a mass of caramelized onions, olives and anchovies served on a pale, flat crust made of bread dough ($3), and sandwiches like thick, moist slices of turkey breast with arugula and tomato on whole-grain bread spread with a carrot-soy puree ($5.50). The Cake Bar is expecting a wine-and-beer license soon, but for now fresh-squeezed juices are available.
Did somebody say dessert? There are many attractive choices, including Linzer cookies ($2.25), eclairs (two for $1.50) and a beautiful pyramid made of dark chocolate, filled with passion fruit mousse and coconut ($4.50). But my absolute favorite is raspberry mousse cake ($4), a small, football-shaped pastry filled with mousse so richly flavored you can taste it with your whole body. Call it the icing on the Cake Bar.
 
More Than Tea
 Right across the street from the Cake Bar is the much smaller The Adore, a charming little tea room that also has an upstairs-downstairs design. And in contrast to the Cake Bar's self-consciously modern design, The Adore, which is three years older, is pure farmhouse, with wooden tables, old law-office wooden chairs, plank floors and old wooden cabinets.
The menu includes many interesting sandwiches and salads, like smoked mackerel, served with cucumber, tomato and onion on thick slabs of white bread swabbed with a sharp horseradish sauce. With a cup of leek-and-potato soup, (very leeky, with lots of pepper), it cost $7.50. The menu includes a wide selection of teas, though not all are always available. A pot of a fruity, almost hibiscus-flavored tea with the improbable name of eros was $2.50. The Adore is at 17 East 13th Street, in Greenwich Village, (212) 243-8742.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW;
Evoking Moses' Vision of New York

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
THE Panorama of the City of New York is a meeting of two minds: yours and Robert Moses'. Oh, yes, the vast scale model looks remarkably like a city: five boroughs worth of miniature buildings, streets, parks and bridges. But don't be fooled. All that physical apparatus is just a scaffold for what can become an intensely emotional mental exchange. Here, you will enter the mind of one of the greatest master planners of all time. You will survey the city through the eyes of the man who transformed it.
Then, moments after stepping inside that legendarily imperial dome, you may begin to discern an urban vision of your own. Memories, hopes, triumphs, disappointments: these are among the landmarks on the private map that begins to take shape as you look around the Panorama. The places you've lived, or wanted to. The good or bad times you had there. The connections and disconnections of a life lived in New York City. 
 All that, and Trump Tower, too. Patched up, repainted, brought up to date with the addition of hundreds of new scale models, the Panorama reopened this week in a sparkling new setting in the Queens Museum of Art, the same location where it first went on view 30 years ago as a featured attraction at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. The helicopter ride is gone, and so is the boosterish Lowell Thomas narration that boomed through the speakers of the ride's molded plastic cabs.
But a new installation (part of the just-completed three-year, $15 million remodeling of the museum, designed by Rafael Vinoly) has brought architectural distinction to a place where fairground festivity once prevailed. And the change in tone is apt, for the Panorama was originally conceived as a serious tool for urban planning.
Created at a cost of nearly $700,000, the original 9,335-square-foot model took nearly three years to build. It reproduces New York City's 320 square miles at the scale of 1 inch to 100 feet (the Empire State Building rises a lofty 15 inches). Proclaimed as the largest scale model in the world, it was something of a last hurrah for Moses, the long-time head of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. Moses, who built many of the public works depicted on the Panorama, was nearing the end of his reign when he became president of the 1964-65 World's Fair. Two years before the fair opened, he had been stripped of most of the power he had wielded over the city for half a century. The Panorama was at once a summing up of his achievement and a bequest to the city's future.
Orchard Beach, the Triborough, Throgs Neck and Verrazano-Narrows Bridges, Lincoln Center, Shea Stadium, the Grand Central and Belt Parkways, Stuyvesant Town, Co-op City: these and scores of other projects realized by Moses are, of course, represented on the model. Indeed, to make them stand out from the wood and plastic versions of the city's other buildings, Moses had many of the models for his projects cast in brass. But the legacy he wished to leave to the future was more than the sum of its architectural parts. It was his panoramic vision, an overview sufficiently encompassing to embrace all the parts within one massive urban whole. This was his gift to city planning. He could not conceive of building a city any other way.
In the age of computer simulation, the Panorama comes across as a very primitive planning tool. A school child with a Sim City program can erect a metropolis in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it took to create this metropolis in miniature. But even when the Panorama was new, the way of thinking it reflected had become outmoded. The future rejected the sweeping vision Moses tried to bestow upon it.
By 1964, the concept of master planning had fallen into disrepute. Critics like Jane Jacobs fought successfully against huge urban renewal projects for housing and transportation. The bridges and parkways planned by Moses, once symbols of the heroic builder, came to represent his abandonment of mass transit. The God's-eye view represented in the Panorama had come to represent an arrogance that citizens were no longer willing to tolerate. Instead of concentrating power in one man's hands, the city began to decentralize authority with newly empowered community boards and citizen groups, who took as their focus the neighborhood, the street, and the connective urban tissue Moses and his bulldozers had ripped to shreds.
Today, 30 years later, many people are less inclined to judge Moses so harshly. The decay of the city's infrastructure has made it easier to look back with appreciation at a figure who was able to get so many public-works projects off the drawing boards. It is wonderful, of course, that New Yorkers get to see their Panorama all patched up. But when will we see the overhaul of the city it represents?
Although the Panorama never had much future as a planning tool, its usefulness as a city of memories and dreams has increased with the years. Looking down on it from the vertiginous ramps that Mr. Vinoly has suspended along the museum walls, one is reminded of the feeling one gets sometimes while looking at the Manhattan skyline from the window of a plane: the relief of getting away from it all, or of coming back home determined to shrink yesterday's mountains into mole hills.
But visitors walking along the ramps can gaze down into wistfulness also, as the memory follows the eye along those miniature avenues, zooming down into neighborhoods that have irrevocably changed (should preservation laws apply to toy towns?), scanning streets once walked along with yearning. It's always back to the drawing board in New York.
Restoration of the Panorama, which took two years and cost $1 million, was performed by Lester Associates, the West Nyack, N.Y., firm that originally built it. Maps and aerial photographs were consulted to bring the model up to date. In 1964, the model contained more than 800,000 buildings; this inventory has now been increased by nearly 95,000 new structures, including a number of scale models donated by architectural firms during the building boom of the 1980's.
The buildings are mounted on 275 panels, of Formica and foam, which have been cleaned and repainted. Thousands of lights, originally color-coded to identify hospitals, schools and other municipal services, have been incorporated into the Panorama's night scene. All the buildings have been recoated with ultraviolet paint to create a glowing glimpse of New York after dark.
Perhaps the most conspicuous change documented by the renovation is the explosion of development on Staten Island. Thirty years ago, it was still possible to think of the island as a rural enclave. Today, as the eye scans an almost seamless carpet of suburban houses, it is easy to see why many Staten Island residents would want to secede from New York City. They're already living in another world. (But why, some Manhattan chauvinists will be tempted to grumble, doesn't their island pull out first?)
The restored Panorama is only one portion of a master plan that has been slowly transforming the Queens Museum of Art into one of the city's handsomest places for viewing art. New galleries, an auditorium and a ravishing sense of open, flowing space are among the features of Mr. Vinoly's superb design. The museum, which houses a public ice-skating rink in its eastern wing, still serves as a repository for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of plaster cast sculptures. Some of these are displayed on a mezzanine overlooking the Unisphere, now clearly visible through new plate-glass windows in the museum's main facade.
The Unisphere itself was renovated earlier this year, and, for those who actually visited the 1964-65 World's Fair, it can be a remarkable jolt to walk out of the Panorama and behold the great steel globe gleaming in the autumn sun, like a polished piece of memory brought back to the light of day.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P. Assault on Welfare

 BODY:
The welfare reform proposal drafted by House Republicans would violate good sense by turning welfare programs over to the states. It would violate common decency by victimizing millions of children, including legal immigrants. It would even violate the reasonable notion that Government should help needy Americans willing to work.
What the House Republicans have in mind is not reform but a grotesque assault on the poor for the sake of honoring their ideological war on Government. Its punitive measures go way beyond what conservative Democrats and Republicans, let alone President Clinton, have recently proposed. 
 The draft's overriding theme is that welfare spending should be largely controlled by states. This is exactly wrong. States may be the right places to locate many programs Washington now runs, but welfare is not one of them. States have a huge financial incentive to skimp on benefits -- to drive poor residents out and persuade the poor from other states never to enter. Note that states eviscerated welfare benefits during the 1970's and 1980's while Washington kept Federal benefits whole.
The draft would tear holes in the social safety net that has been built in stages, with strong bipartisan support, since the Depression. Food stamps and cash benefits are Federal entitlements for every eligible family. The House Republicans would rip up this sacred contract, putting an annual limit on Federal expenditures. The change would be profound: come a recession, when the number of families qualifying for food stamps and welfare rises, Washington would not spend an extra dime.
Private charities might pick up the slack. States might spend their own money -- though few will rush to raise taxes during recessions. More probably, the needy will go empty handed. A long-term female worker who loses her job during a recession will be put on a waiting list for welfare -- though she paid taxes for years. Federal welfare was started during the Depression to save children no matter where they lived. The need remains.
The Republicans plan to cut Federal spending on welfare, food, housing and nutrition by about $60 billion over four years. The biggest reduction is aimed at legal immigrants, who would become ineligible. Even Proposition 187, passed in California this month, did not go after legal immigrants, who work and pay taxes like everyone else.
There has been a huge increase in the number of elderly immigrants on welfare. But that problem could be solved humanely, as Mr. Clinton proposes, by extending the period during which an immigrant's sponsor would be financially responsible.
The Republicans say their aim is to allow people to climb out of poverty by no longer providing a perpetual meal ticket. But they have no compunction about sawing off the ladder. They omit requirements that states provide education and training. They allow states to cut off welfare after two years -- and require a cutoff after five years -- to mothers who are working at public jobs but cannot find private sector jobs. Mr. Clinton would continue subsidized work as long as necessary.
The draft proposal would also cut off children born out of wedlock and children whose paternity had not been legally established -- even if the mother had supplied the name. Newt Gingrich, the next Speaker, glibly assumes that people thus excluded will find refuge in private charities or public orphanages.
But if Mr. Gingrich is wrong, consider the outcomes: A 30-year-old mother gets laid off but is permanently ineligible for welfare because she exhausted her two-year limit as a teen-ager. A young mother and her child go hungry because the state bureaucracy dawdles in establishing paternity.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that studies poverty programs, estimates that the proposal would knock five million children -- about half the current caseload -- off welfare. That is not reform. That is carnage.

HEADLINE: Fed Raises Interest Rates on Dubious Grounds;
Slow the Money Supply

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Who really believes the nonsense from the Federal Reserve when it says that increasing its interest rates will somehow decrease inflation ("Misplaced Fears About the Fed," editorial, Nov. 17)? 
 A different power of the Federal Reserve has a much greater impact on inflation. That is the ability to make the money supply grow at rates higher or lower than the growth of the economy in general. Economists know that inflation is mainly the result of the money supply's growing faster than the economy. If the Fed were truly serious about reducing inflation, it would mandate that the money supply grow only as fast as the economy, say 2 or 3 percent a year.
This would be a welcome safeguard. Unfortunately, in 90 years the Fed has refused to offer the American public this guarantee. Instead, it seems to want to inflict inflation and deflation at will.

HEADLINE: Unable to Protect Product Trademarks, Manufacturers Copyright the Boxes

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 24

 BODY:
If Parfums Givenchy and other premium-product makers continue to prevail in their use of copyright law, consumers could find fewer cut-rate deals on prestige perfume, cosmetics, crystal ware and other luxury goods at their local discount stores.
 That, at least, is the implication of a Federal appeals court ruling here last month that stopped Drug Emporium Inc., the discount-drugstore chain, from selling Givenchy's Amarige scent at prices as much as 35 percent below suggested retail. Drug Emporium has asked for a new hearing. 
 Drug Emporium is one of thousands of unauthorized distributors of "gray goods," high-priced brand-name products that escape their manufacturers' distribution systems and find their way into discount and off-price stores.
 Givenchy's legal success hinged on its novel use of an obscure section of copyright law that prohibits the unauthorized importing into the United States of copyrighted goods made for other markets. Since only original text, recordings and designs can be copyrighted, Givenchy protected its imported fragrance by copyrighting the design of the box.
 The decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, to uphold this use of copyright could set off an avalanche of suits, threatening discount retailers that rely on importers for their bargains.
 "This is going to go far beyond cosmetics," said R. Lawrence Bonner, a lawyer with Greer, Homer & Bonner in Miami, who represents Drug Emporium. "Every product manufactured overseas that comes in a box can use this approach if their boxes are found to have artistic merit, and that has grave implications for consumers. A huge portion of the products at stores like Kmart and 47th Street Photo are bought from unauthorized importers."
 A Federal district court in Los Angeles recently ruled in favor of Lladro Inc., a Spanish manufacturer of porcelain figurines, in a copyright-infringement case against a company now called Price/Costco. Curtis A. Bradley, a lawyer at Covington & Burling in Washington, who represents Lladro and Givenchy, said he expected the court to issue an injunction barring Costco from selling the figurines.
 Already, the case has reignited a long-simmering debate in legal and marketing circles that pits consumers' interest in low prices against the right of manufacturers to protect their markets and the quality of their products.
 "Why should U.S. consumers pay higher prices than the rest of the world?" asked David Stewart, a marketing professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. "That is price discrimination that would be illegal if it happened within the United States."
 But manufacturers argue that they should be able to charge whatever local markets will bear without goods' being diverted to the discount aisles, costing them millions of dollars in revenue. Such sales, the manufacturers contend, also tarnish their image and that of their products -- which, sold like cheap trinkets, may be damaged and without valid warranties.
 Givenchy, for example, says unauthorized distributors have sold perfume that spoiled from sitting too long on foreign docks in the hot sun. "As the manufacturer, we're the one who is culpable in the consumer's mind," said Robert Brady, president of Parfums Givenchy Inc., the American subsidiary of Parfums Givenchy S.A. "It's very damaging to the image of quality we have spent millions to build."
 No one knows how many goods made for other markets migrate back into the United States without the makers' consent, but the manufacturers have estimated that they lose as much as $15 billion a year to the gray market. As much as 25 percent of the fragrances sold in the United States are gray goods, according to the Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of American Trademarks in Washington, whose members include Ford, Givenchy, Benetton, Chanel, Macy's and Procter & Gamble.
 Many manufacturers hope that the Givenchy victory marks a turning point in the gray-market wars. Earlier this month, the company broadened its attack beyond Drug Emporium by filing copyright-infringement lawsuits against a band of unauthorized distributors, including Wal-Mart, Sears and Kmart.
 Swarovski America Ltd., a subsidiary of the Austrian crystal company, has a pending copyright-infringement suit against Price/Costco. And copyright lawyers say several cosmetics companies are considering similar actions. The Lancaster Group U.S.A., for example, has copyrighted the bottles and boxes of its fragrances, including Cool Water and Joop!
 Because gray goods are usually authentic, not counterfeit, the Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that the Customs Service cannot stop them from entering the country. Trademark laws are ineffective because they require manufacturers to show that the imports differ from the domestic brands and therefore confuse consumers. Such distinctions can be impossible to prove since many companies are manufacturing the same product lines worldwide to increase efficiency.
 But in overhauling the copyright laws in 1976, Congress responded to lobbying efforts of the book and record industries and wrote a provision, Section 602, aimed at helping manufacturers combat the gray market.
 As the gray market has grown, so has the law's use. But its reliability as a weapon for packaged-goods companies was sealed with the Givenchy decision.
 The appeals court rejected Drug Emporium's use of the "first sale" doctrine, in which the discounter argued that Givenchy had given up its rights to protection once it sold its perfumes to suppliers abroad. The doctrine is based on the principle that the copyright owner has benefited economically from a first sale and cannot further control sales of the product.
 Judge Mariana F. Pfaelzer ruled that the first sale doctrine applies only to sales in the United States and that Givenchy had been deprived of such sales because of the unauthorized distribution by Drug Emporium.

HEADLINE: Oregon's 'Out-of-Step' Senator Steps Forward

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 20

 BODY:
Term limits, a balanced budget amendment, school prayer -- these are "phony" solutions to the nation's problems. The military budget needs to be cut. The death penalty violates Christian principles. And there is nothing wrong with being a liberal.
Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, the man espousing those post-election heresies, is a lifelong Republican who is nearing the end of his third full decade in the Senate. He says, proudly, that he spent most of the years under President Reagan trying to undermine his program, and that he is the only active senator who has never voted for a military authorization bill. 
 "I've been out of step most of my political life," said Mr. Hatfield, looking down at the sweep of the Willamette River from his office here. "What else is new?"
What's new is that the Senate Appropriations Committee will once again be in the hands of Mr. Hatfield, who is perhaps the closest thing in Congress to a pacifist -- or "a McGovern-nik," to use the words of House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
In fact, George McGovern was once Senator Hatfield's closest ally on military matters, joining forces with him long ago to propose a legislative amendment to end the Vietnam War.
As a young Navy officer in World War II, Mr. Hatfield was one of the first Americans to see Hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped on it in 1945. The horror lives with him, he said, and resonates in such actions as his lone vote in the Senate against both military action and economic sanctions in the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
At age 72, Mr. Hatfield has long been known as the politician of peace and pork from faraway Oregon, a state where there is no better compliment than being called a maverick.
It seems 1995 may just be Oregon's year. The Ducks, from the University of Oregon, will start the New Year in the Rose Bowl, a West Coast football champion for the first time since 1958. And every penny that will be spent by the Federal Government, outside of Social Security and other so-called entitlements, will have to pass through the committee led by a man from a state with less than 2 percent of the nation's population. Oregon's other Republican Senator, Bob Packwood, weakened two years ago by accusations of sexual misconduct, will be back in charge of rewriting the nation's tax laws as chairman of the Finance Committee, which he headed in the early 1980's.
While the galloping elephants of the new Republican-controlled Congress have been hailing the dawn of a conservative era, Mr. Hatfield has been sitting back in Oregon, newly energized, a large grin on his face. The Clinton Administration has certainly noticed; a day after the election, six Cabinet members called him.
"I'm prepared to work with the White House," he said. "I can't afford to be a partisan guerrilla." Thwarting the expected attack on domestic programs and attempt to raise military spending will require "bridge-building" with a lot of Democrats, he said.
From 1981 to 1987, the last time Mr. Hatfield served as chairman of the Appropriations panel, he was able to divert $100 billion that President Reagan wanted for the Pentagon into social programs instead. He fought the proposed "Stars Wars" missile defense system with passion, urging Democrats to join him in opposing "this madness," as he called it.
This time around it will be much harder to accomplish such changes in spending.
"These Republicans are talking about building a fire wall between discretionary defense and discretionary nondefense programs, meaning that if we had the votes, we couldn't turn it over like we did in the 1980's," he said.
But that does not mean Mr. Hatfield will not try to shrink the military budget. With the cold war over, there is no reason for spending billions on elaborate weapons systems, he said.
"The way to do this is to point out all the redundancies in our arsenal," he said. "They used to say, 'What about the Russians?' Well, who are the Russians this time?"
When Iraq was mentioned, he laughed. "I don't look at Saddam Hussein as a threat," he said. "I see diminishing oil supply as a threat, and Saddam is a symbol of that."
He said the military budget could be cut by reducing the Pentagon's civilian work force by 15,000 employees and by turning down new weapons systems.
Mr. Hatfield's staunchest opponents are likely to be from his own party. The Appropriations defense subcommittee includes Republicans like Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, Phil Gramm of Texas and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, none of them wallflowers when it comes to advocating military might. Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska will be the chairman.
"We have voted against each other in the past," said Senator Stevens, when asked about how he would try to steer the subcommittee around Senator Hatfield. "But we have never had an open fight."
Mr. Stevens added: "I respect his position. It is deeply felt. But he knows how I feel about the defense structure."
On other matters, Mr. Hatfield seems to relish being the spoiler at the Republican garden party. He rolled his eyes when asked about Mr. Gingrich's "Contract With America," the blueprint for the Republican Congress.
A deeply religious man who has written three books about matters of faith, Mr. Hatfield opposes a constitutional amendment to allow officially sanctioned prayer in public schools. He also thinks mandatory term limits for elected officials are not needed. "Look at what happened to Tom Foley," he said of his Northwest colleague, ousted by voters in Washington state this month after 30 years in the House. And he opposes a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget.
"These are all symbols, and the Republicans will beat the drums and get a lot of pizazz going because they have fed the public a line about these things," he said. "But to present them as if they are the answers and solutions to our problems is just phony."
He sees parallels between the proposed amendments and President Reagan's tax cuts in the 1980's. "The biggest increase in our deficit in history took place in those years under a man presented as the high priest of conservatism," Mr. Hatfield said. "It was another example of imagery versus substance."
Mr. Hatfield is not always on the liberal side; he has opposed abortion, for example. But with all the positions he has staked out to the left of his party, it is a wonder he is still a Republican. He said he became one in the 1940's because he believed in civil rights and considered the Southern Democrats who controlled so much of Congress to be racists. Among current Republican Senators, only Strom Thurmond of South Carolina has served longer than Mr. Hatfield.
Senator Hatfield says he is proud to be called a liberal Republican. "Lincoln was a liberal," he said.
He has struggled through some low points, being formally rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee in 1992 for failing to disclose gifts worth more than $43,000.
Long considered a friend of environmentalists, he said he was hurt by insults hurled at him in the fight over Northwest forests. "They called me a pimp of the timber industry," he said. "We have 43 wild and scenic rivers in this state, more than two million acres of wilderness, and nobody can match my record on these things."
But now, with the election having made Mr. Hatfield perhaps the most powerful friend of the environment in Congress, environmentalists are coming to him on bended knee, looking to him as the savior of public land in the Pacific Northwest. He said he will try for no more than "fine-tuning" of the Endangered Species Act, considered the most powerful environmental law on the books. And he will not try to force the Forest Service to allow more timber cutting than provided by law -- a tack he tried in the mid-1980's.
"The halo is back on Mark Hatfield," said James Moore, a professor of political science at the University of Portland. "Even with that ethics lapse, he has been remarkably consistent."
With two years to go in his fifth term, Mr. Hatfield was thought to be contemplating retirement, after nearly 50 years in Oregon politics, from state legislator to Governor to the Senate. Now, back in power and in the limelight, he is not so sure.
"I only have $30,000 in the bank," he said. "But you know what: I've decided to hold a fund-raiser next month."

The chairman who turned Sony into an innovative power resigned. Sony said Akio Morita, 73, who co-founded the Japanese company, was stepping down because of health problems. During his 22 years as chairman, Sony achieved spectacular successes with its television sets, stereo equipment, video cameras and the much-imitated Walkman tape player. [Page 39.]
 
Goldman, Sachs will coordinate the sale of Deutsche Telekom to investors outside Germany. The sale of Germany's telephone company is the largest privatization ever in Europe. The appointment as one of three global coordinators is a coup for Goldman, which will reap huge investment banking fees. [39.]
 
The Westin Hotel Company will be sold in a $561 million deal to a joint venture formed by Starwood Capital; Goldman, Sachs, and the Edward Thomas Companies of Beverly Hills, Calif. [39.]
 
Mayflower Group is in talks to sell its household-moving business to the private company that operates United Van Lines. Shares of Mayflower jumped 15 percent after the announcement. [41.]
 
Two of Britain's biggest home-lending companies plan to merge and go public, creating a $140.6 billion banking company. [41.]
 
In an unusual move, Maine helped Central Maine Power buy an independent plant that provided it with electricity. [41.]
 
The German financier who runs Lonrho sold a stake in the Kempinski hotel chain to a Thai joint venture for $83.5 million. Dieter Bock is shedding his holdings to focus on Lonrho. [41.]
 
 
The Economy
 
The holiday shopping season began, even if many people did not begin shopping. For now, many shoppers are still looking for bargains rather than loading up on presents. [39.]
 
Created to stop racial discrimination in the workplace, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is choking on bureaucracy and a mounting backlog of discrimination charges. [1.]
 
 
Markets
 
Stock prices recovered some ground in light, post-holiday trading. But stocks fell across Europe, hurt by expectations that when most of Wall Street returns on Monday, stock prices will continue their slide. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.36 points. [39.]
 
Treasury prices were mixed after two sessions of strong gains. Investors who had fled stocks for bonds earlier this week apparently decided that the selloff in stocks had subsided. [47.]
 
Uncovered short sales in stocks traded on the Nasdaq system fell for the third consecutive month. [50.]
 
The dollar was little changed in quiet trading. The Italian lira continued to slide against the German mark and the dollar. [51.]
 
Soybean, corn and pork prices were higher on a day when most commodity markets were closed. [51.]
 
 
Your Money
 
Investor gloom is a silver lining for some investment advisers. After this week's sharp decline in stocks, many investors expect the worse, which means, these contrarians argue, that the smallest ray of hope can make the market climb. [36.]
 
Cyclical stocks are a disparate group of issues, united only by a general tendency to mirror the direction of the economy. But cyclical stocks manage eventually to go in one direction, as the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index shows. [36.]
 
Tuesday will be an important date for investors who plan to close out losing investment positions before the year ends. [36.]
 
Money transfer services have grown in recent years. Generally, the faster the service, the more expensive it is. [38.]

HEADLINE: Short Day Gives Dow 33.64 Gain

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market recovered yesterday about a fifth of the ground it has lost since Nov. 16. The few traders on the floor in a shortened session on the day after Thanksgiving tended to buy interest rate-sensitive stocks whose prices had fallen because of the Federal Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates so far this year.
 Bond prices were mixed, and the dollar was little changed. European stock traders bid down prices overseas yesterday, convinced that when most of Wall Street returns on Monday, stock prices in the United States will continue their slide.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.64 points, to 3,708.27, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 2.36 points, to 452.29. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 5.82 points, to 742.52.
 Still, the Dow had fallen for five sessions in a row before yesterday, for a total drop of more than 170 points. Yesterday's advance meant about a 20 percent recovery in the Dow.
 "I had been expecting something of a snapback," said James B. Macko, vice president for equity trading at McDonald & Company Investments in Cleveland. "But I had expected it next week. Today may be a small portion of that snapback."
 Broader indexes have also fallen. The S.& P. 500 had fallen 15.69 points in five sessions, and with yesterday's advance had recovered about 15 percent. The Nasdaq index dropped 32.94 points for the same period and gained back nearly 18 percent. Even one of the broadest possible measures, the Wilshire index of 5,000 stocks, had dropped 165.55 points, but recovered nearly 17 percent.
 Yesterday, seven stocks advanced for every three that declined, or 1,496 winning stocks and 564 losing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was far below normal at 113.9 million shares because the exchange closed at 1 P.M., instead of 4 P.M.
 In Europe, British stock prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent, German stocks fell two-tenths of 1 percent, but French stocks rose six-tenths of 1 percent. While local issues affected the outcome, most traders cited uncertainty in American financial markets as a drag on their markets.
 In Britain, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 issues fell 3.1 points, to 3,033.5, in part because Prime Minister John Major faced a parlimentary vote on Monday on payments to the European Union that threatens to bring down his Government. In Germany, the DAX index of 30 stocks fell 4.35 points, to 2,051.62, as some investors started shifting investments to bonds out of stocks. But in France, the CAC index of 40 stocks rose 11.21 points, to 1945.89.
 In the United States, most stocks that advanced were those that investors had shunned at earlier points in the year because of the Fed's tightening of interest rates. These groups included chemical companies, drug manufacturers, retailers, computer software developers, electric utilities, computer makers and banks.
 American depository receipts of Sony rose 1 1/4, to 51 3/4, despite a large write-off for its movie-studio operations and yesterday's resignation of its co-founder, Akio Morita. Mr. Morita suffered a cerebral hemorrhage a year ago.
 Musicland Stores established a 52-week low of 12 3/8, down 2. A Smith Barney analyst lowered her assessment of the speciality retailer to "underperform" from "neutral, " citing discount pricing and higher advertising costs.
 The most active stock, at 2.4 million shares, was Intel, which fell 1 1/4, to 63 7/8. The company has acknowledged that its Pentium computer chip could cause inaccurate results in rare cases in complex scientific calculations and that newer chips have been corrected.
 Shares of Gibson Greetings rose 1 1/8, to 13 7/8. Gibson and Bankers Trust announced on Wednesday that they had agreed to settle Gibson's lawsuit accusing the bank of improperly leading the company to engage in risky financial trades. Bankers Trust shares rose 3/8, to 57 1/8.
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.42 points, to 247.60, and the American Stock Exchange market value index gained 2.29 points, to 434.69.
 Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 21 rose, led by Alcoa, which rose 2 3/8, to 80 3/8. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 286 rose, led by Merck, which gained 3/4, to 36 5/8.
 In Tokyo, stocks were slightly lower. The Nikkei index of 225 issues lost 34.31 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, at 18,666.93. For the week, which was shortened by a national holiday on Wednesday, the Nikkei was down 635.63 points.

HEADLINE: Five Years Later: Eastern Europe, Post-Cummunism -- A special report;
Ethnic and Religious Conflicts Now Threaten Europe's Stability

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
Five years after the fall of the Berlin wall, Checkpoint Charlie has moved 600 miles southeast to a bridge over the Miljacka River in Sarajevo, where coils of barbed wire and occasional tearful family reunions testify to the new divisions of Europe.
Here at the bridge, Benjamin Hamidovic, a Bosnian Muslim, stands guard. He gazes out, past the wire and the French United Nations soldiers in their blue helmets, to the far side, held and guarded by Bosnian Serbs. It is very close, the other bank, but eerily distant -- another land in a severed city. 
 The division at this bridge is new but no less treacherous than the old one between cold-war ideologies. Mr. Hamidovic is one of the myriad people who have already fallen victim to the ethnic and religious conflicts that lurked beneath the clamp of Communism and have since erupted, revealing the fragility of the societies and borders once behind the Iron Curtain.
As yet, the West has no coherent response to these conflicts; indeed, the United States and Western Europe have been divided by them. Their failure to work together to end the Bosnian war suggests that the security of Europe, now lacking effective guarantees, will be uncertain for many years.
Economic progress and political opening were supposed to follow Communism in Eastern Europe. They were the logical consequence of what the West saw as its victory over totalitarianism. Instead the Caucasus has erupted, and Yugoslavia has seen an atavistic retreat into nationalist fury that has cast the shadow of concentration camps and the Serbian slaughter of Bosnia's Muslims across the European Continent.
Against this madness, grand Wilsonian principles like the self-determination of peoples and grand institutions like the United Nations and NATO have proved no insurance. All of them will probably have to be rethought after the death of 250,000 people and the displacement of two million in a Bosnian conflict born of old grievances, economic stagnation, the cynical leadership of Communists-turned-nationalists and Western disarray.
Certainly, the gloom of Bosnia has come not only from the fighting. It has also stemmed from the way NATO, the European Union and the United Nations have been revealed as cumbersome and divided before the ethnic conflicts of post-Communist Europe.
In July, President Clinton was celebrating cooperation between the United States and Europe during the cold war. "No wall can forever contain the mighty power of freedom," he intoned in Berlin, at the site of the wall that once divided the city. But he did not mention the divided city of Sarajevo, where American soldiers have been as conspicuously absent as they were decisively present in Berlin, and his words rang hollow in a Europe now increasingly bereft of American leadership.
Of course Sarajevo is not Berlin, at least not yet; a division of the world into hostile blocs does not lurk behind the city's barriers. But it is far from clear that Europe's new cleavages, rooted in the vagaries of tribal allegiance, are less menacing than those of the cold war. Already, the potential of Bosnia's rival armies to be proxies for a resurgent Islam and for pan-Slavic sentiment is apparent.
Across the Miljacka River bridge, in the Grbavica section of Sarajevo, Mr. Hamidovic had his house until old suspicions between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims erupted into war in 1992. He and his Serbian wife fled in June, 1992, sending their 12-year-old daughter to her grandmother in Belgrade for what they imagined would be a brief sojourn. They have not seen her since.
"I've tried to talk to her on a ham radio, but her voice sounds so terrible," Mr. Hamidovic said, shaking his head. "I really feel totally crazy."
 
Disintegration
Ethnic Memories Foster Disunity
 Already the three states in Eastern Europe without a clear ethnic identity -- the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia -- have disintegrated since the fall of Communism five years ago.
But fertile soil for the Yugoslav disease exists elsewhere in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Long subservience to alien empires or Communist rulers, economic backwardness, historical grievances and the general absence of democratic tradition have created receptive audiences for militant nationalism, which has a facile appeal in that it promises a glorious future on the basis of a supposedly glorious past.
There are more than 25 million ethnic Russians outside Russia, at least 2.3 million ethnic Hungarians outside Hungary, at least 2.2 million ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and the Kosovo region of Serbia, a vociferous Greek minority in Albania and a large Turkish minority in Bulgaria.
If Serbian claims to territory could bring an intractable war to the Balkans, what of an eventual explosion of Russian nationalism under Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, or an Albanian drive to unite its people in a single country or a sudden Hungarian itch to recover the large swaths of territory lost to Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia after World War I?
Unease is evident. Ethnic Albanians vow to achieve autonomy, or even independent states, in Kosovo and western Macedonia. Greece has expelled more than 50,000 ethnic Albanians in reprisal for the arrest of five ethnic Greeks in Albania. The ethnic Russians in the Baltic states and the Ukraine are a lingering source of tension.
Romania's Hungarian minority is fuming over a recent decision by the local authorities to remove a bronze statue of the 15th-century king Mathias from the Transylvanian city of Cluj because, some Romanians say, he symbolizes 500 years of Hungarian oppression before Transylvania became Romanian after World War I.
Averting these dangers is arduous. The Iron Curtain was all of a piece: it could be policed, and American troops, among others, did so. But the jagged fragments of old enmities are a mined and scattered terrain.
"The Yugoslav war has revealed Western institutions as bungling, incompetent and powerless," said Jonathan Eyal, the director of studies at the Institute of Strategic Studies in London. "We thought we could bark and people in the Balkans would listen, but they defied us and found us naked. The message that sends is terrible. The only question now is how violent the Bosnian war will be and how far will it spread?"
 
The 'Freezer'
Brief Stability In Communism
 It is now clear that if Communism brought oppression to the people of Central and Eastern Europe, it also brought stability to the group of countries that emerged with the collapse of the Russian, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and German empires after World War I. Yugoslavia was formed as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Czechoslovakia was created from the ashes of the Hapsburg Empire, Poland was reborn, Hungary was drastically diminished by the Trianon treaty, and Romania was enlarged at Hungary's expense.
But these new or extensively remodeled countries were promptly savaged by the Depression, then by World War II, and never had time to develop democratic institutions or a secure identity.
From the start, this insecurity found expression in ethnic tensions and the persecution of minorities. Throughout the area, Jews were often the object of discrimination, rendering Nazi Germany's program of extermination much easier to carry out when Hitler's forces overran or subdued most of Eastern Europe.
In this sense, the latest outbreak of ethnic violence and bigotry on the volatile soil of Eastern Europe should have come as no surprise. But a kind of complacency among Western leaders -- a New-World-Order fogginess, even a vague notion that history was ending -- may have blurred the fact that history was really beginning again, and at full throttle, with the disappearance of Communism.
"Communism was a freezer," said Dominique Moisi, the deputy director of the French Institute for International Studies. "It simply froze old hatreds. Unfortunately the hatreds thawed before the European Union was strong enough to provide a concerted response in the absence of real American leadership in Europe."
 
Yugoslavia
Buried by Tito, The Past Rises
 People in Eastern Europe were keenly aware of the dangers. "Each nation naturally wanted to look to the moment in history when it was strongest to prove its territorial point," said Branko Crvenkovski, the Prime Minister of a vulnerable new state, Macedonia.
Among the Serbs, the obsession was particularly acute.
Like many Bosnian Serbs, Milorad Ekmecic, a historian at Sarajevo University, was caught up in tragedy as a civil war raged in Yugoslavia during World War II.
By mid-1941, Croatia was under the control of the Nazi-puppet Fascists known as the Ustashe; Serbia was divided between Nazi collaborators and a royalist resistance known as the Chetniks; and Josip Broz, a Croat who went by the nom de guerre Tito, was emerging as leader of the ethnically mixed Communist Partisans fighting the Germans from a power base in Bosnia.
A civil war that would claim more than half of the roughly 1.5 million Yugoslavs killed in World War II had begun, amid a Ustashe campaign of extermination -- sometimes supported by Bosnian Muslims -- against Serbs, Jews and Gypsies, and a Chetnik rampage against Muslims in eastern Bosnia.
"I remember standing in the garden with my father, and the Croats and Muslims were throwing rocks at us," Mr. Ekmecic said. "Then -- it was the day after Germany invaded Russia -- my father went to work as usual at a tobacco plant. He never came home. Later, I discovered he had been taken away by the Ustashe and shot by a Muslim who worked with him."
By the end of the war, the Serbian population of the Capljina area had been halved. Mr. Ekmecic's mother, who joined the Partisans after her husband's death, was executed by the Nazis in 1943.
But when Tito, as victor, came to power after the war, his chief concern -- in the overriding interest of Yugoslav unity -- was to place a seal over Yugoslavia's civil strife and the myriad killings like that of Mr. Ekmecic's father.
In some cases, this sealing of history was quite literal. Concrete was poured over the pits in Herzegovina where the bones of countless executed Serbs lay. In other cases, history was simply ignored in the hope that it would disappear: Tito never visited the Jasenovac concentration camp, scene of the worst Ustashe crimes against the Serbs.
In official parlance, Yugoslavia's civil war became a war of liberation fought by the Yugoslavs against the Nazi invader. But the truth lay elsewhere, and as recent events show, the truth has a way of exacting a heavy price.
"The reality is that the Communists defeated Serbian and Croatian nationalism as well as the Nazis," said Milovan Djilas, one of Tito's closest aides until he broke with him in the mid-1950's over the failure to introduce democratic reform. "Yugoslav Communism alone resolved the national question after World War II. Tito was acutely aware of this, and to the end, he was afraid that Yugoslavia might break up."
But the dangers inherent in Tito's policy of burying the past are now clear. The inter-ethnic warfare of World War II, never acknowledged, never judged officially, lived on beneath the surface, ready to explode at the slightest provocation.
"A forged and false history created feelings of frustration and hatred," said Dejan Medakovic, a member of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Moreover, the rewriting of history could perhaps have been carried out only by a dictator. Instead of moving toward greater democracy after his break with Stalin in 1948, Tito began the elaborate balancing act that he would maintain until the end of his long life in 1980.
This policy involved offering ever greater autonomy to Yugoslavia's constituent nations and placing himself at the fulcrum, rather than extending the individual liberties, the democratic institutions and the scope for personal economic initiative that alone might have cemented Yugoslavia.
The culmination of this policy, in the 1974 Constitution, was the raising of Bosnia's Muslims to the status of a constituent nation -- a decision that gave Tito one more piece to manipulate in his balancing game.
But all games come to an end. Nationalist parties in Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia were easily able to exploit the resentments and frustrated ambitions, especially after economic stagnation in the 1980's. Yugoslavs were looking back rather than forward.
<PHB>The Prospects
Will Ethnic War Keep Spreading?
 On Aug. 4, 1990, Mr. Ekmecic went to Prebilovci in Herzegovina to exhume from a pit the bones of about 800 Serbs massacred by the Ustashe. Work began on an Orthodox monastery at the site, but its foundations were later blown up by the Catholic Croats during the Bosnian war.
Mr. Eckmecic joined the Serbian nationalist party in Bosnia because, he said, "I was terribly frightened that Yugoslavia was coming into a situation similar to the one my family passed through in 1941-45."
Fear, long frustration, deep anger -- part rational, part psychosis -- appear to have been pervasive among the substantial Serbian minorities of Croatia and Bosnia as these two former Yugoslav nations pressed for and then gained independence in 1991 and 1992, against the will of the Serbs.
In Bosnia, a murderous Serbian rampage against Muslim civilians ensued, matching horrors suffered between 1941 and 1945: concentration camps, rapes, mass executions, mutilation, evictions.
And yet, it should not have been hard to see the warning signs -- first in Croatia, and then, even more after the Croatian war, in Bosnia. The unresolved issue of the Serbian minorities was conspicuous.
James A. Baker, then United States Secretary of State, visited Belgrade in June 1991. His message, in essence, was that the United States was opposed to the breakup of Yugoslavia and opposed to the use of force to hold it together.
"It was a little too subtle for these guys," a United States official said. Shortly after Mr. Baker left, Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence.
The official added: "We were up against two conflicting principles: the inviolability of Yugoslavia's borders and self-determination. Well, the Europeans wanted the problem, so we decided to hand it over. That, of course, was a departure."
The Europeans, with pretensions to a united foreign policy but no army to make foreign policy mean anything, were incapable of any coherent approach to ethnic war on their doorstep.
By December 1991, their veneer of unity had fallen away altogether with Germany's extraordinary, unilateral recognition of Croatia and Slovenia.
When the rest of the European Union, and ultimately the United States, decided there was no way back from this German decision, the die was cast. The world was officially committed to Tito's internal borders in Yugoslavia even though they were still being disputed on the ground by rival armies of Serbs, Muslims and Croats. The issues thus raised remain unresolved.
As the Bosnian war festers, Western nations have been trying to deal better with the specter of ethnic conflict elsewhere.
At the initiative of France , nine countries -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia -- did commit themselves this year to negotiated solutions to any ethnic or border disputes.
The United States, meanwhile, has sent a battalion of troops to Macedonia, another small ex-Yugoslav nation, like Bosnia, born through the principle of self-determination as expressed through a referendum, but lacking any ethnic coherence or recent history as an independent state.
The troops are doing something new for American soldiers abroad: trying to stop a war from starting. That is, they are trying to stop Macedonia -- peopled by Macedonians, Albanians, Serbs, Turks, Vlachs, Greeks, Bulgarians and others -- from disintegrating like Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and Bosnia.
Their task is arduous. As in Bosnia, principles brought Macedonia into existence, but history and facts are against it.
Aside from internal tensions, none of Macedonia's neighbors is favorable to its existence. Greece claims exclusivity over the name Macedonia; Bulgaria says Macedonians are really Bulgarians; Serbia would be happy to absorb the country into the remains of the Yugoslav federation, and Albania sides with the aspirations for autonomy, or independence, of the large Albanian minority.
In fact, while American soldiers dutifully monitor the Macedonian-Serbian border, the real danger in Macedonia lies in the Albanians, accounting for about 30 percent of the population. In their stronghold of Tetovo, feeling is running high.
"If we don't get at least autonomy, Macedonia will not exist," said Alivebi Aboulahu, a chemistry professor. "I am certain that a Bosnian explosion will come here. Why should we be suppressed by the Macedonians in land that was always ours?"

Map: "The Region Historically"
Yugoslavia, founded in 1918as the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, was the expression of the desire of the south Slav people for independence from long imperial domination -- the Austro-Hungarian empire in the western part of the territory, the Ottoman Turkish empire to the east.
 
Its problem from the outset was Serbian numerical and political domination.
 
The forebears of the Croats and Serbs settled the area in the 7th century. But tghe line of the Great Schism that divided the Eastern and Roman Churches in 1054 came between them: Croats are now Roman Catholic, Serbs Eastern Orthodox.
 
Muslims, the majority of whom live in Bosnia, were Slave who converted to Islam during the Ottoman Turkish rule of Bosnia, which lasted from 1463 to 1978, when Bosnia came under Austro-Hungarian administration.
 
When Slovenia and Croatia declared independance in 1991, followed by Bosnia in 1992, the chief political problem was the large Serbian minorities in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They opposed independence, and with the help of the Serb-controlled Yugoslav Army they seized large swaths of each country.

HEADLINE: Willem J. Luyten, 95, Expert on Stellar Motion

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. Willem Jacob Luyten, an astronomer whose work expanded the understanding of stellar motion, dying white dwarfs and the origin of the solar system, died on Monday at his home in Minneapolis. He was 95.
 The cause was heart failure, his family said. 
 Born on Java, Dr. Luyten (pronounced LOY-ten) spent much of his career at the University of Minnesota. He started in 1930 as an assistant professor and served as professor of astronomy and department chairman for many years before reaching emeritus status in 1967.
 He was noted for his work with the photographic-plate scanner and a computerized version of the device that he developed in the 1960's. He was aided in that ambitious undertaking by financing from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the expertise of engineers of the Control Data Corporation.
 The computerized version, which was a laser scanner and measuring device, tracked stars on plates taken several years apart with the same telescope. It automated what had been a highly cumbersome process of studying star motions.
 The computerized scanner produced more than 400,000 new stellar motions from images made for the Palomar-National Geographic Survey, including more than 6,000 of the stars known as white dwarfs. Dr. Luyten found some 90 percent of the white dwarfs known to exist at the time.
 A white dwarf is an exotic stellar species of enormous density that gives off little light; it is considered the final stage of evolution of most stars. For his work in that area, colleagues sometimes referred to Dr. Luyten as the "stellar mortician."
 His favorite anecdote on the subject concerned the time he asked the National Science Foundation for financial help in organizing a conference on white dwarfs. He said his request prompted a letter from the Surgeon General "that human subjects couldn't be used for experimentation and that Federal money could not be used for race discrimination."
 The University of Minnesota did not have observational equipment, but Dr. Luyten received much help from observatories in this country and abroad. He said that international cooperation was essential among astronomers, and he liked to call himself the most successful parasite in the field.
 He was born in Semarang on Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies. As a boy, he become curious about astronomy when an uncle awakened him to marvel at Halley's Comet in 1910 as it lit up the sky, bright enough to cast a shadow. "A sight you don't forget," he said. He graduated from the University of Amsterdam and earned a doctorate in astronomy at the University of Leiden in 1921.
 He also studied at the Royal Observatory in England and the Lick Observatory of the University of California. From 1923 to 1930 he worked as an astronomer and assistant professor at Harvard University before moving to Minneapolis. He published 490 articles in 71 years of research.
 In the 1920's, while at Lick and Harvard, he also reported for The New York Times on events like the total solar eclipse of January 1925. He went up in a plane to report on the dramatic scene and photograph the moon's shadow as it moved across Manhattan.
 Dr. Luyten is survived by his wife of 64 years, Willemina Miedema Luyten; two daughters, Mona L. Coetzee of Pittsburgh, and Ann L. Dieperink of Afton, Minn.; a son, Dr. James R. Luyten of Falmouth, Mass.; seven grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Little Change In Holiday-Slowed Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed in light, post-holiday activity yesterday.
 With a dearth of economic news and many currency dealers absent after the Thanksgiving holiday, market participants monitored American stock and bond markets to determine the direction of the dollar. 
 Hugh Walsh, currency trader at ING Capital Markets in New York, said: "Stocks performed quite well, and bonds were up a little bit. That lent support to the dollar."
 But with stocks having fallen so far earlier in the week, "it seems like the topside is limited for the dollar," said Charles Spence, director of treasury marketing at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. Currency dealers watch the American stock and bond markets to gauge foreign demand for American assets and the dollars needed to buy them.
 In New York yesterday afternoon, the dollar edged up to 1.5598 marks from 1.5556 in New York on Wednesday. The dollar rose to 98.78 yen, from 98.47 yen on Wednesday.
 "There is some good demand for dollars" from American fund managers holding overseas stocks, Mr. Spence said. Holders of overseas equities are selling foreign currencies for dollars to lock in gains that the foreign currencies have achieved in the last several months, he said.
 With foreign stock prices having fallen during recent days in tandem with stocks in the United States, American fund managers have wanted to book profits on the currency conversion to compensate for losses they have suffered on their stock holdings, Mr. Spence said.
 For example, the dollar has fallen 10.4 percent against the mark since the beginning of the year, while the Frankfurt stock exchange's DAX index of 30 stocks lost 2.5 percent this week.
 The Italian lira, meanwhile, continued to slide against the mark and the dollar as a question mark hung over the Government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Milan magistrates warned him this week that he was being investigated on corruption charges.
 The lira touched 1,037.70 lire to the mark in European trading, surpassing its previous record of 1,037.40 reached on Tuesday. In New York, the dollar rose to 1,616 lire, from 1,607.50 lire on Tuesday.
 In other currency trading in New York, the British pound fell to $1.5630, from $1.5705 on Wednesday. The dollar rose to 1.3207 Swiss francs from 1.3190 francs.

HEADLINE: Milton J. Shapp Is Dead at 82: Ex-Governor of Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
Milton J. Shapp, former Governor of Pennsylvania and a Philadelphia industrialist who was the first Jew to mount a campaign for the Presidential nomination of a major party, died on Thursday at Lankenau Hospital in Wynnewood, a suburb of Philadelphia. He was 82.
 The cause was Alzheimer's disease, family friends said. 
 Mr. Shapp, a Democrat, served as Governor from 1971 to 1979 and instituted a state income tax and lottery. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for President in 1976.
 Before he became Governor, Mr. Shapp worked on John F. Kennedy's Presidential campaign and is credited with promoting the idea that eventually led to the creation of the Peace Corps.
Fresh out of the Army Signal Corps after World War II, during which he was a captain and served in North Africa, Italy and Austria, Mr. Shapp, an electrical engineer, founded the Jerrold Electronics Corporation in 1948. The company went public in 1956 and did $25 million annually in business. A decade later, when Mr. Shapp sold his interests, the corporation's business was up to $50 million a year.
 Born in Cleveland, Milton Jerrold Shapp attended the Cleveland public schools and earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University) in 1933.
 He entered public life in 1960, when he became an early supporter of Mr. Kennedy. In the 1960 election, he served as chairman of the Business and Professional Committee for John Kennedy in the Mid-Atlantic States. During that campaign, Mr. Shapp suggested to Mr. Kennedy the idea of forming a Peace Corps. In a speech at Penn State University on March 9, 1961, titled "Peace and the Peace Corps," Mr. Shapp outlined for the first time the basic policies that were to serve as a guide for the operation of that organization.
 He returned briefly to business in mid-1963, but plunged very quickly again into politics. He made an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 1964. After that effort failed, he worked in the campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson and organized businessmen in the East for him as he had done for President Kennedy.
 In his two terms as Governor, Mr. Shapp won national attention for his consumer-advocate policies and his innovative programs for elderly and handicapped people. He was largely credited with bringing Pennsylvania back from the brink of deficit.
 Mr. Shapp also instituted full financial disclosure for top officials, the most comprehensive of the so-called Sunshine Laws for open government in the nation and a strict code of ethics for all state employees. A violinist, Mr. Shapp made his concert debut as a soloist with the Erie Philharmonic in 1978.
 In an interview during his Presidential bid in 1976, he was asked why he was running.
 "I compare myself to the people who were talking about becoming candidates," he answered. "In knowledge of the economy, in ability to develop programs and get them implemented, and I couldn't see anybody comparable. I saw the caliber of these people and I said, 'What the hell.' "
 But he withdrew in March of that year after having picked up only one delegate. He blamed a late start and "putrid" news coverage for his poor showing in a crowded field of Presidential aspirants.
 In a 1981 letter to The New York Times, Mr. Shapp sharply criticized President Ronald Reagan's sale of Awacs electronic-warfare planes to Saudi Arabia.
 "It would be far more beneficial to America's future economy and to its security if the President would implement a major civilian Awacs program by beginning a war against city slums in our nation," he wrote. "Unless we soon start to cope realistically with our major internal problems, no amount of sophisticated weapons in our possession or in the hands of so-called allies will be able to stave off internal disruption."
 Mr. Shapp battled Alzheimer's for several years, said Richard Gross, a family friend.
 He is survived by his wife, Muriel; two daughters, Dolores Graham and Joanne Shapp; a son, Richard, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Man In The News;
Soul Mate For Pataki -- Joseph Louis Bruno

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 25

 BODY:
With the ascension of Joseph L. Bruno as the presumptive majority leader of the State Senate, Governor-elect George E. Pataki has gained a political and philosophical soul mate at the top of state government.
 Mr. Bruno is, above all, a fiscal conservative who has argued relentlessly about the need to cut state spending and taxes during his 18 years in the Senate. And unlike the man he deposed, Ralph J. Marino, he is both a gregarious colleague in the Senate and an eager, sharp-tongued spokesman for his beliefs. 
 With his shock of white hair, his regal posture and his deliberate style of speech, Mr. Bruno has the bearing of a circus ringmaster. As he demonstrated with the coup he completed today, he is ambitious and capable of playing a mean brand of Albany politics. He lured Mr. Marino into complacency two weeks ago by issuing a statement saying he would not challenge the leader, then quietly reversed course and gathered the votes he needed before Mr. Marino could defend himself.
 "I think Joe moves quietly but effectively," said Thomas G. Cholakis, the Republican leader in Rensselaer County, where Mr. Bruno lives, across the Hudson River from Albany.
 The 65-year-old Mr. Bruno was one of the first Republican state senators to endorse Mr. Pataki, and he is close personally to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers. Mr. Powers, a former D'Amato aide whom Mr. D'Amato picked to lead the state party, lives in Mr. Bruno's district, and the two men are close friends.
 Several Republican senators said today that Mr. Bruno's selection, coming so quickly after Mr. Pataki's election and the strengthening of Mr. D'Amato's grip on the state party, was the death knell for New York's signature brand of moderate Rockefeller Republicanism. Mr. Bruno, perhaps even more than Mr. Pataki, hails from the upstate wing of the party that is both fiscally and socially conservative.
 He supports the death penalty, opposes abortion rights and opposes legislation to insure civil rights for homosexuals. A businessman who built a telecommunications company from scratch and became a millionaire, he abhors the state's policies on taxation and business regulation. During his first 13 years in the Legislature, he bucked the leadership of the Senate to vote against budget bills that included tax increases, as Mr. Pataki has done in recent years. In the last five years, he voted for budgets that included increases in taxing and spending in order to show support for Mr. Marino, he said.
 Mr. Bruno said in an interview today that he shares core beliefs with Mr. Pataki.
 "The things he believes and talks about," Mr. Bruno said, "are things I've been talking about for years and years: too much taxation, too much spending, mandates that aren't funded for municipalities, and over-regulation. We smother people. We smother business, and government has been too oppressive. That's got to change."
 Joseph Louis Bruno was born on April 8, 1929, in Glens Falls, on the southern border of the Adirondacks. His father, an immigrant from Italy who never learned to read English, worked as a laborer his entire life, most of it shoveling coal at a paper mill. His mother, who bore eight children, died when Mr. Bruno was 17.
 "We were about as poor as anybody can be," Mr. Bruno said, remembering that he spent his childhood in a six-room cold-water flat where it was common to wake up and find ice stuck to the inside of the windows.
 He graduated from St. Mary's Academy in Glens Falls and Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs with a bachelor's degree in business administration.
 In 1959, Mr. Bruno and a partner founded the Coradian Corporation, a company that sold commercial telephone systems in the Northeast and Midwest. The company flourished, at least in part because of business from state and local governments where Mr. Bruno had political influence. Those ties, and the possible conflicts of interest they posed, were investigated by the Governor's Commission on Government Integrity in the late 1980's, although the commission ultimately found more fault with the state's conflict-of-interest laws than with Mr. Bruno.
 When Mr. Bruno sold the company to Mitel Systems Integrators Inc. in 1990, it had 700 employees. The sale made Mr. Bruno a wealthy man, although he said today that "I don't live a wealthy life style."
 The Senator lives on a 50-acre farm in Brunswick, where he raises thoroughbred horses, which he rides in local parades.
 After serving as a campaign aide to former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, as an assistant to Perry Duryea, who was Assembly Speaker at the time, and as chairman of the Rensselaer County Republican Committee, Mr. Bruno first won election to the Senate in 1976. During his tenure, he has served as chairman of four committees, those on consumer protection; insurance; elections, and commerce, economic development and small business.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bonds Are Mixed In a Short and Thin Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in thin post-holiday trading yesterday as some market participants decided that the recent selloff in stocks had subsided.
 The Treasury market had benefited from a flight of investors out of stocks and into bonds after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 91.52 points on Tuesday. But stocks recovered some ground yesterday, with the Dow gaining 33.64 points. 
 James Hale, fixed-income analyst for MMS International, said he was surprised by the bond market's resiliency given the strength of stocks yesterday. "Under normal conditions, long bonds should have fallen at least a half-point," he said.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up only 1/32 , to 95, leaving the yield unchanged at 7.94 percent from Wednesday.
 The financial markets were closed on Thursday in observance of Thanksgiving and the markets closed early yesterday after a recommendation by the Public Securities Association, a securities industry group.
 In overseas trading before the New York opening yesterday, Treasury securities gave back some of their gains from earlier this week and that set the tone for trading in the United States yesterday.
 Lawrence R. Rice, chief investment officer for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, described yesterday's market as thin with little trading. "Technically, we've been due for a rebound in bonds," he said. "Whether this will continue depends on whether the economy is beginning to show signs of slowing down."
 Bonds surged on Tuesday and Wednesday, turning in their best performance in more than three months as investors sold stocks in favor of bonds because of attractive returns offered in fixed-income investment.
 But as stocks recovered somewhat yesterday it encouraged some unwinding of positions in the debt market.
 Bonds, however, could make further gains in the coming weeks if the prospect of an economic slowdown entices more investors to turn away from stocks.
 The economy is currently growing faster than the 2.5 percent pace Federal Reserve officials say can be sustained without the threat of inflation's picking up. According to the Government's first estimate, the economy expanded at 3.4 percent in the third quarter. On Wednesday, the Government is scheduled to make its first revised estimate of the gross domestic product for the third quarter.
 The revised G.D.P. number will be closely watched for evidence that the Fed's six increases in short-term interest rates this year are starting to slow the economy down.
 Other economic data scheduled next week include a report on October home sales by the National Association of Realtors on Monday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News expect that home resales fell three-tenths of a percent.
 The Conference Board on Tuesday will release its November index of consumer confidence. The economists surveyed believe the index will post a slight gain to 87.8 from 87.7 in October.
 Mr. Hale of MMS International said the two reports likely to move the market would be the national purchasing managers report on Thursday and Friday's employment figures
 "We're looking for some fairly healthy numbers from both," he said, "and that should squash the speculation of a slowing economy," adding, "Yesterday's diehards, which gave bonds some strength, could end up proving to be martyrs next week."

HEADLINE: Stores Say No to Sales Taxes, for a Day

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
For John and Tammy Guerriero, it was one of those pleasant little surprises at the mall. While jostling through the throngs of holiday shoppers yesterday -- the year's busiest shopping day -- they found a pair of shoes for their 4-month-old son, Michael, for exactly 8.25 percent less than they expected to pay.
 "Geez, we might come back for another pair," said Mr. Guerriero, a carpenter and Staten Island native, as the couple emerged from the Buster Brown shoe store in the sprawling, 200-store Staten Island Mall, Michael babbling happily in tow. 
 "If this kind of thing catches on, I won't have any reason to shop in New Jersey," he said.
 That, according to the organizers of yesterday's No Sales Tax Day on Staten Island, was exactly the point. They contend that the 8.25 percent sales tax shoppers must pay in New York City -- of which 4 percent goes to the state and the rest to the city -- is driving customers to New Jersey, where the rate is lower. In an effort to attract more shoppers and to protest the tax rate, the organizers said they persuaded 88 merchants, including 7 in the Staten Island Mall, to pay the sales tax themselves for a day, and pass the savings on to their customers.
 "We can't expect merchants to take this hit for an extended period," said Bob Cutrona, president of the Voice of Staten Island Business, a year-old merchants' group that organized the promotion. He said the day of tax breaks was not likely to be repeated soon.
 "But I'm confident we've made our point loud and clear," he added. By last evening, several of the participating merchants had reported higher than expected sales, in part, they said, because of the tax discounts.
 Perhaps a better measure of the event's impact was the publicity it attracted. At the Staten Island Mall, television crews and newspaper reporters darted between the seven "No Tax Day" stores, seeking expressions of tax outrage from shoppers and merchants alike.
 "Wouldn't it make sense for the state simply to eliminate sales taxes on the day after Thanksgiving?" wondered Amy Goldman, the manager of the Buster Brown Store, where the Guerrieros found their bargain baby shoes. "We are simply losing too many sales to New Jersey."
 Staten Island merchants are not the only ones with complaints over the wide disparity in sales taxes between New York and New Jersey. But it is here, on an island that has far more convenient bridges to New Jersey than to its home state, where merchants say the sales tax has taken its biggest toll in lost business.
 The disparity is greatest in purchases of clothing, on which New Jersey levies no sales tax. And on most other consumer goods, New York City's combined 8.25 percent tax rate compares with 7 percent in New Jersey.
 According to the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce, which worked with Mr. Cutrona's group to organize yesterday's promotion, Staten Island merchants should generate $3.7 billion a year in sales, but 30 percent of that amount, or $1.11 billion, is lost to New Jersey, largely because of the sales tax difference.
 Staten Island merchants can have little hope that yesterday's sales event, in itself, will lead to changes in New York tax policy. But there is some cause for encouragement -- Governor-elect George E. Pataki has said repeatedly that he hopes to reduce taxes, although he has not singled out sales taxes.
 Sheldon Silver, a Democrat and Speaker of the New York State Assembly, did refer directly to sales taxes two weeks ago, saying that they should be cut.
 Those involved in yesterday's Staten Island protest offered several proposals for tax reform. Mr. Cutrona said he hoped the state would eliminate its share of sales taxes in Staten Island and throughout New York City, since merchants in the city are hurt the most by competition with New Jersey.
Paul Ferrara, the chairman of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce, offered another prescription: an state-designated Economic Development Zone, including all or most of Staten Island, in which sales taxes would be cut or eliminated. Several such zones already exist in New Jersey.
 Tom Keough, manager of the Easy Spirit shoe store, which opened in the Staten Island Mall in September, said the effect of the New York State sales tax had quickly become apparent because there is another branch of Easy Spirit in the Woodbridge Mall, 20 miles west in New Jersey.
 "Since we opened, their sales have not fallen off at all, and they should have because we know a lot of the people shopping at Woodbridge are coming from Staten Island," he said.
 Mr. Keough, one of the Mall's seven merchants participating in yesterday's event, said he thought there was little chance that the tide would turn soon in the long running interstate battle for retail sales.
 Nonetheless, he said the day had been a success.
 "We think this is a way for merchants to show their support for Staten Island, and that they are a strong part of the community," he said.

HEADLINE: Westin Hotel Co. to Be Sold To Starwood and Goldman

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
The Starwood Capital Group, a privately owned real estate investment firm, and Goldman, Sachs & Company announced yesterday that they had agreed to acquire the Westin Hotel Company from the debt-burdened Aoki Corporation of Japan in a deal valued at $561 million.
 The purchase price will include cash, seller financing and the assumption of mortgage debt. The percentages were not disclosed. 
 Westin, which has revenues of more than $2 billion, manages, franchises and represents 80 hotels and resorts in 19 countries. They include the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco, and a Westin hotel that recently opened in Providence, R.I.
 The Westin Hotel Company will be acquired by a joint venture formed by Starwood Capital and Goldman, Sachs, together with Goldman's partner, the Edward Thomas Companies, a hotel company based in Beverly Hills, Calif. Nomura Asset Capital Corporation will provide financing for the acquisition, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1995.
 The deal will give the joint venture total ownership of nine hotels, 50 percent of the Arizona Biltmore and various interests in three other hotels. Among those involved are the Westin Hotels at the San Francisco Airport and Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Aoki will retain ownership of five Westin hotels in Canada and various interests in four Westin hotels in the United States; it will also retain the Westin trademark in Asia. The new owners will manage the nine hotels and hold a long-term license on the trademark in Asia.
 Barry Sternlicht, president and chief executive of Starwood, which has headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., said the new owners would focus not only on improving the hotel company's profitability but also on seeking rapid growth by adding franchises and buying hotels.
 "The expansion of the international trade and travel markets," he said, "coupled with the capital and resources of both Starwood and Goldman, Sachs, positions us to rapidly expand Westin as one of the premier hotel companies in the world."
 The sale occurs when the United States hotel industry is rebounding strongly from almost six years of depressed room rates, occupancy and revenues. Arthur Andersen & Company recently estimated that total revenues would increase 5 percent this year, to $64.8 billion, and an additional 4.8 percent in 1995, to $67.9 billion.
 Much of the improved performance results from increased business travel, and, Mr. Sternlicht said, "Most of our hotels are business oriented."
 Starwood, which was founded by Mr. Sternlicht in 1991, included in its original limited partners the Ziff publishing family and the family of Carter Burden, a former New York City Council member. In November, the Pritzker family of Chicago, which owns the Hyatt hotels, also became a limited partner.
 Starwood and its affiliates have acquired interests in more than 100 properties, costing more than $700 million. Among them are more than 30 hotels. It recently completed refinancing the Boca Raton Hotel and Club in Boca Raton, Fla., in which it has an interest. It is the second-biggest holder in the big multifamily real estate investment trust Equity Residential Properties Trust.
 Westin was founded in Seattle in 1930 and privately owned until 1970, when it was bought by a subsidiary of United Airlines. In 1988, the Aoki Corporation, a construction company with diversified businesses, purchased it for $1.53 billion.
 But Japan's economy has since gone into a tailspin, and Aoki's debt burden has mounted, prompting the company to look for a buyer for Westin. In February, Bernardo Dominquez Cereceres, whose Mexican construction company also owns a small hotel chain, accounced that he would buy 74 Westin hotels for $708 million -- hundreds of millions of dollars higher than other bids, and, in the opinion of analysts, too high for profitability.
 Then, last month, Mr. Dominguez said he and his investor group were withdrawing from the deal because of rising interest rates, volatility of high-yield bond markets and Westin's inability to achieve the rates of return they initially projected.
 Starwood Capital, which had been working with Mr. Dominquez, signed the deal itself and invited Goldman, Sachs in as a partner.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Those Cyclical Stocks Are a Disparate Bunch

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
CYCLICAL stocks may wind up on top in the weeks ahead, some stock pickers say, especially now that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates once again.
 There is just one problem: What are cyclical stocks? 
 What, for example, is the common thread between Caterpillar Inc., the Illinois-based maker of heavy equipment; Placer Dome, a Canadian gold miner; Knight-Ridder, a newspaper chain based in Florida?
 They are all regarded by stock-market professionals, in a fuzziness of terminology, as stocks that tend to move up or down in synchronization with the economy.
 But "in sync" rarely means the precision of the Navy's Blue Angels, but more often the scattering of a flock of geese. Yet even cyclical stocks, like geese, eventually go in one direction, as the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index shows. And so far this month, the index has fallen 10.4 percent.
 Plotted against the gross domestic product since June 1991, when the economy started to expand in earnest, the stock price of Morgan Stanley's cyclical stocks have tracked the economy fairly well.
 The index consists of 30 stocks in 25 separate industries: groups traditionally thought of as cyclical, like aluminum, steel and chemicals, as well as groups that are not, like discount retailers, newspaper chains and computer-chip makers.
 No one cyclical stock mirrors the economy, said Thomas M. McManus, the Morgan Stanley investment strategist who devised the index. But the nontraditional stocks help, too, he said. In Knight-Ridder's case, help-wanted advertisements, especially in Miami, Detroit, and San Jose, Calif., reflect regional growth.
 Katherine R. Hensel, chief investment strategist for Lehman Brothers, said interest rates were the key to thinking about the economic cycle. In the early part of an economic expansion, autos, appliances and other big-ticket consumer durables thrive because the Fed is keeping interest rates low.
 But as the economy expands, the Fed raises rates, hoping to restrain consumer demand and therefore inflation. The most rate-sensitive industries, those with products likely to be bought by consumers on credit, peak in stock price first and then fall.
 Then, companies farther down the economic chain may be next in line to be hurt by higher rates. Capital-goods stocks, like Caterpillar, a heavy-equipment maker, thrive during the middle part of an expansion and, nearing the end of the cycle, basic materials like aluminum, paper and chemicals are the penultimate stars. Finally, at the very end of the cycle, when interest rates are high, oil and energy stocks, those with fewer products for the consumer, are the last to peak.
 Yet consumer durables, capital goods and basic materials tend to be called cyclical stocks as if they were identical. Prices for auto stocks and other durables, however, peaked in the last quarter of 1993, capital goods in the first quarter this year and basic materials performed well and may have peaked in the third quarter.
 Is the economy at the bottom of the hill or, as seems likely, at the top? And if it is at the top, is it about to go down? Or is the economy about to plateau and then climb again? Economists disagree.
 Still, many analysts think the economy is near the top and hence the stocks to avoid are aluminum, paper, chemicals and other basic-industries stocks that have peaked. Others disagree.
 Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, does not recommend oil. He prefers basic-materials stocks like the Aluminum Company of America, Reynolds Metals, Bethlehem Steel, ARCO Chemical and Monsanto.
 "We can still get more juice out of this orange," he said.
 For the most part, however, market strategists recommend oil and natural gas. Lehman Brothers, for example, likes Chevron, Mobil, Murphy Oil and Total Petroleum. Morgan Stanley likes Anadarko Petroleum, a Houston natural-gas company.
 But beyond recommending oil and gas, the consensus breaks down. Like Mr. Sohn of Norwest, even the stock pickers of Lehman Brothers think there is juice to come from some of the early-stage cyclicals like Ford, Maytag, Whirlpool, Deere, Johnson Controls and a homebuilder like Lennar.
 With steeply rising interest rates, Mr. McManus of Morgan Stanley recommends buying "stocks that act like bonds," utility shares like Unicom, Public Service of Colorado and Illinova, formerly Illinois Power.
 Douglas A. Kass, director of institutional equities with J W Charles in Boca Raton, Fla., recommends gold and silver stocks, the ultimate cyclical investments. Inflation will surge, he said, and investors will flock to gold miners like Newmont Mining, Placer Dome, and Battle Mountain, as well as silver miners like Hecla Mining. "They're for aggressive investors," Mr. Kass said. "But it may become necessary."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Tax Date Looms for Bullish

BYLINE: By Ellen C. Lesser 

 BODY:
To the short list of important dates in your relationship with the Internal Revenue Service -- Dec. 31 and April 15 -- this year add Nov. 29. The date is important for bullish investors who plan to "accelerate capital losses," or close out losing investment positions before the year ends.
 While all investors can gain tax advantages by selling losers before year-end, those who are bullish may want to act by Tuesday, the deadline this year for "doubling up." The strategy is to buy additional shares of losing securities now and sell the original shares for a loss on Dec. 30. In this way, investors can lower their 1994 tax bills while leaving themselves poised to catch any market run-up in January. 
 Such transactions must be initiated by Tuesday because the I.R.S. does not give investors the tax advantages of a capital loss if there's a "wash sale," an offsetting trade of a substantially identical stock or security within 30 days.
 "We are getting more questions this year than last year, mostly in relation to bonds, because interest rates have gone up and the bonds that clients held have gone down in value," said Anthony Ventura, a vice president of tax planning at Smith Barney.
 With bond swaps, "the I.R.S. has never defined how much different the yield and maturity must be," Mr. Ventura said. "You can go from New York City to New York State bonds and you won't have a problem, but if you go from one New York State bond to another New York State bond, the question is, 'How much should you change the yield and maturity?' "
 Unlike other capital losses, those created in a wash sale cannot be used to offset capital gains this year. The loss does not evaporate but gets added to the cost basis of the newly purchased shares.
 For example, if 100 shares bought for $1,000 are sold for $750, a capital loss of $250 occurs. Generally, the tax code allows this loss to offset $250 in capital gains, offset other income up to $3,000 or be carried into the next tax year. But, if within 30 days before or after the sale, the investor buys 100 shares of the same stock for $800, the loss will not be allowed in 1994. Instead, the basis for the new shares will be set at $1,050 (the purchase price plus the disallowed loss). Any tax benefit from the $250 loss will be realized only after the shares are sold for good.
 Instead of doubling up, Richard E. Cripps, the director of equity marketing for Legg Mason in Baltimore, recommends selling losing shares now and taking advantage of the unduly depressed prices that often hit smaller stocks and over-the-counter issues in the closing days of the year when others sell to meet their own tax goals.
 "The buyers of these stocks historically have good gains six weeks later," he said. "If you sell now, you can theoretically be a buyer in the last week of the year, which is generally a very attractive time to buy."
 The risk of selling now is that the stock could rise before year-end and you would have no benefit other than the tax loss.

Players Told to Expect a Unilateral Move

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Major league club owners are prepared to take one of three steps when they meet in Chicago on Dec. 5, players were told in a memo they received from the union this week, but management's most likely action will be a vote on implementation of a salary cap.
In the memo dated Nov. 22 -- a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times -- Donald Fehr, the head of the union, told the players that John Harrington, the owners' labor spokesman, stated the clubs' intentions at the last bargaining session last Saturday. 
 In his two-page memo, Fehr wrote that Harrington "told us that unless there was a settlement or a counterproposal from the players that the owners committee would recommend that the owners accept, a vote would probably be taken at the owners' meeting on 5 December to implement the salary cap."
Given that neither of the first two possibilities will become reality, the owners will be left with the decision to install a new economic system.
To implement the cap unilaterally, the owners would have to declare an impasse in negotiations. They are apparently prepared to take that step in spite of the presence of Bill Usery Jr., a mediator asked by the White House to work with the two sides, and the possibility that the union will formulate a counterproposal at its executive board meeting in Atlanta that same week.
Declaring an impasse on the eve of receiving a new proposal would seem to be a contradictory act, but a labor lawyer said the owners can do whatever they want unless their action is blocked by a court injunction. The union would ask the National Labor Relations Board to seek an injunction, but it is not easily achieved.
The two sides are scheduled to return to the Washington area on Monday, meeting separately with Usery that day, then resuming negotiations Tuesday. The bargaining, however, could be brief because the players are expected to reject the tax proposal and the revised salary cap proposal the owners made last week and they will not have the counterproposal the owners hope to see.
"It is apparent," Fehr wrote in his memo, "that the revised salary cap proposal we received is the proposal that we expected the owners to make before they unilaterally implemented the salary cap. The revised salary cap still includes virtually all of the objectionable features of the initial proposal."
The owners' proposals, Fehr also noted, include elements from a series of proposals the owners made last May 23 that represented givebacks. "Presumably," he said, "the owners intend to implement these proposals along with the salary cap."
Among those proposals, players called to the major leagues in September after rosters are expanded would not receive major league service credit and players could be released for any reason, or no reason.
Under the existing uniform players contract, a club can release a player if he fails "to exhibit sufficient skill or competitive ability to qualify or continue" as a member of the team.
Under the proposed contract, a club can release a player if he fails "in the opinion of the Club's management, for any reason or any combination of reasons, including economic considerations, to warrant a position" on the team. In other words, if a club decides on the last day of spring training that a player is making too much money, it can release him and owe him only minimal termination pay.
In another proposal, the clubs will establish a salary scale for players in their first four years in the majors, but a player in his fourth year could wind up earning the first-year salary of $115,000 instead of the fourth-year salary of $500,000. That would happen if, after his third season in the majors, a player were not tendered a contract by his team and he became a free agent. When he signed with a new club, he would receive $115,000.
The players don't like those parts of the proposals any more than they like the cap or the tax, which they feel acts as a cap.
The owners' negotiators, Fehr told the players, "made it clear that, ideally, no club would exceed the threshold," the limit over which clubs would have to pay tax on their entire payrolls. If clubs kept their payrolls at or below the threshold, that number, in practice, would become a cap.
The owners, though, never intended to make the tax proposal more attractive to the players than the cap. The cap is the system they want.
Despite the strike and the reduced revenues and payrolls, the clubs have informed the players that for purposes of determining cap-related figures, they will use 1994 projections. That means $1,743,296,000 in revenue would be divided 50-50 for the 1995 season, leaving the players with $871,648,000 for salaries and other costs.

HEADLINE: Reject the New Arms Guidelines

 BODY:
America has a rare chance to use its dominant position in the arms market to inhibit the international traffic in weaponry. Unfortunately, new guidelines governing American arms sales abroad, now on President Clinton's desk, would toss away that chance.
With the end of the cold war, global arms sales began to dry up and competition intensified to capture what was left of the market. The demonstrated prowess of American arms in the Persian Gulf war allowed the U.S. to dominate the market, accounting for well over half the world's sales. That would enable Washington to take the lead in restraining sales, especially to volatile regions like the Middle East. 
 The defense industry has resisted restraints. With the slowing of Pentagon procurement, the industry looked overseas to peddle its wares. Now the Pentagon wants to turn export promotion into a strategy for keeping the industry afloat, and Mr. Clinton is being asked to sign on.
The guidelines are pernicious in several ways. To win government approval for an arms deal under existing rules, arms makers have had to show that the sales would promote U.S. security, cooperation with a foreign government and regional stability. One unwritten purpose of the sales has always been to help domestic industries keep their production lines open. In the new guidelines, that purpose is explicitly stated, giving commercial considerations much higher priority than before.
The guidelines would also provide up to $1 billion in loan guarantees for arms exports, adding to the billions in subsidies the defense industry already receives to market its wares. That will only invite U.S. competitors to sweeten their own subsidies. As an added inducement to buy American, U.S. companies sometimes offer to co-produce arms abroad, leading to a loss of control over military technology. The guidelines do little to slow the diffusion of American know-how.
The guidelines would sacrifice long-term security for short-term economic advantage. Mr. Clinton should reject them.

HEADLINE: Energy Efficiency Works, and It Saves Money

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"It Costs More to Save Energy" (Op-Ed, Nov. 20) by Herbert Inhaber and Harry Saunders strays far from the real-world experience we have analyzed in dozens of studies published in widely read, reputable journals and highlighted in the book "Energy Efficiency and Human Activity" (Cambridge, England). 
 Before 1973, energy use in the United States and Europe for homes was increasing more rapidly than the number of homes or appliances. Through the early 1990's, this growth was minimal or negative.
The average American home used 19 percent less energy in 1991 than in 1973, despite an increase in appliances used and area heated. Danish households used 30 percent less energy, despite a 25 percent increase in the number of houses.
It takes 55 percent less fuel to transport an air passenger one mile now than in 1973. Energy consumption in American and European manufacturing in the 90's was close to its 1973 level despite a wide increase in output because energy-efficiency industries increased 35 percent to 40 percent.
Thus efficiency works and has restrained energy use in Western economies by an average of 20 percent relative to production, travel, freight and the level of activities in homes and buildings.
Analyses show the main reason people saved energy was to save money. More important, longer term technological progress reduced the energy and material requirements of basic processes even in times of falling energy prices. Since the days of booming production of energy-gulping raw materials have passed, growth in energy use is restrained even more.
Now there are more of us with higher incomes, using more gadgets and traveling more, following long-established trends. There is little evidence that increased energy efficiency, which lowers energy costs, boosted energy-using activities significantly in recent years, as the article's authors maintain.
This is not surprising, since energy costs -- typically 5 percent to 15 percent of the total costs of owning things, moving about or production -- are seldom a deterrent to activities. Saving energy means saving money, very little of which is recycled into energy consumption.
Mr. Inhaber and Mr. Saunders worry about the trivial energy use of all those hot tubs. Perhaps they've been soaking for too long to understand the real dynamics of energy in our economy.

HEADLINE: New York's Business Districts Make the City Cleaner and Safer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Nov. 20 article on New York City business improvement districts seemed to imply that the districts are devoid of accountability. Our accounting firm provides services to many of these districts, including auditing and consulting services, and I must say the opposite is true. 
 The New York City Department of Business Services, in addition to approving a district plan, reviews each district's annual audited financial statements and oversees delinquent assessments. A department member sits on each board and is consulted on major district activities.
Many of the larger business districts you mention have 20 to 50 board members. They also have numerous committees reviewing everything from personnel policies to annual budgets. In many cases the directors are overinvolved, rather than underinvolved.
Every business district has financial statements audited by independent accountants. The auditor certifies that the reports are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and confirms that the business district is complying with the district plan and all major contractual agreements.
Business improvement districts have cleaned up our streets, provided more security and made many areas more attractive to business. They have worked with the police, sanitation department and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to improve services. There is a good reason Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is so vocal in promoting their growth.
Let's not raise unnecessary fears because there are isolated cases of abuse.

HEADLINE: Energy Efficiency Works, and It Saves Money;
Costs of Inefficiency

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The indictment of policies to save energy by Herbert Inhaber and Harry Saunders (Op-Ed, Nov. 20) is at once defeatist and deficient. 
 In focusing on energy consumption in the United States, the authors overlook the health, economic and environmental consequences of energy inefficiency worldwide. As economies grow, they consume more energy. Inefficient consumption of fossil fuels generates greenhouse gases and other contaminants that impair the function of human and natural systems.
We invite the authors to visit rapidly developing regions of the world like Liaoning Province in China, where energy-profligate industrial policies are choking urban residents in coal soot, sulfur dioxide and other pollutants.
In a country like China, inefficient exploitation of fossil fuels has profound adverse health, economic and ecological impacts, including higher incidence of respiratory illnesses (resulting in lost workdays), acidified lakes (with economic losses to fishing) and toxification of agricultural soils (affecting the quantity and quality of grain harvest).
The closing remarks of the authors about the value of energy conservation seem more myopic. They argue that energy efficiency policies are useful, not because they save energy, but because they "stimulate increased economic activity."
Generally, increased economic activity warrants increased energy consumption. We contend that accelerated economic development is beneficial only if it is accompanied by technologies and practices that assure sustainable energy use.
The interdependencies between energy and environment, health and economic welfare leave society no choice but to promote energy efficiency.

HEADLINE: New York's Business Districts Make the City Cleaner and Safer;
Different Partnerships

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New York is a big city, big enough for more than one group called "Partnership." However, after receiving many phone calls following your Nov. 20 article on business improvement districts, we feel the need to distinguish the Partnership for the Homeless from the Grand Central Partnership, a business district whose work with homeless people is controversial. 
 The Partnership for the Homeless is a nonprofit service organization that operates more than 150 shelters in New York City. It has furnished more than 4,500 apartments for formerly homeless people and provides case management for homeless people with AIDS and H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. It finds permanent housing for homeless families and operates a drop-in center for frail and elderly homeless people.
Our organization also gets more than 650 homeless and formerly homeless New Yorkers into the job market each year.

HEADLINE: For Holiday Shoppers, No Hurry

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Beth Findlay and her mother, Joan Gorelick, spent yesterday morning browsing at the Stamford Town Center in Stamford, Conn.
 In Macy's, they picked up a couple of pairs of earrings that were already gift-wrapped and bought a sports shirt that was on sale for Mrs. Gorelick's husband, Dan. But mostly they just prowled the mall, trying to get into the holiday spirit. 
 "I'm still trying to figure out what to get people," Mrs. Findlay said. "I'm really just shopping for ideas."
 On what has traditionally been the busiest shopping day of the year, many shoppers seemed to be taking that tack, seeking inspiration. Others were simply whiling away a holiday weekend morning or afternoon. Even the early arrival this year of Hanukkah, which starts tomorrow night, seemed to bring no added urgency.
 But all were keeping an eye out for bargains and vowing to postpone at least some purchases until closer to the Christmas holiday, hoping that skittish retailers would slash prices.
 Despite abundant promotions intended to get people to shop early, "the notion that the day after Thanksgiving is the biggest sales day of the year has become myth," said Isaac Lagnado, principal of Tactical Retail Solutions Inc., a retail consulting firm.
 Mr. Lagnado said he expected Christmas Eve, which falls on a Saturday this year, to be the most lucrative for retailers, followed by Dec. 23 and Dec. 17.
 To visit stores yesterday was to see consumers practicing their skills at this game of chicken.
 "I'm not so particular about what I'm buying, so I always shop around until the week before Christmas because the prices just get better and better," said Susan McKinney, a secretary who works in Stamford.
Craig Donaldson, a business manager in Boston, brought his children to Manhattan on Thursday to see the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and the F.A.O. Schwarz store. But he was not planning to shop at either store. "We don't shop on Fifth Avenue," he said. "We shop at outlet malls in Kittery, Me."
 Most stores yesterday were offering discounts on selected merchandise, while some, like J. C. Penney, Sears and Wal-Mart, enticed shoppers with early-bird specials that began as early as 6 A.M.
 The discounts are likely to continue, because many retailers have slightly heavier inventories of apparel than they had anticipated for this time of year. Unusually warm fall weather had inhibited sales of sweaters, coats and other cold-weather gear, which must be cleared out by the end of January.
 The busiest stores yesterday were those selling items for the home. At the Williams-Sonoma store in Stamford Town Center, customers laden with goods waited in line 10 deep at each cash register, and Brookstone, which sells everything from basic tools and lawn and garden equipment to fancy gadgets, was full of people trying out leather recliners with built-in massaging mechanisms.
 Stores selling apparel were much less busy. Clerks behind the cosmetics counters at Saks Fifth Avenue were working hardest at applying makeup to their own faces, and in the Limited store, workers kept busy folding sweaters and straightening displays.
 Stores that sold gift items fared better. Banana Republic, which does most of its business in clothing, lured customers with prominent displays of satin scarves, velvet gloves and holiday party wear just inside the doorway.
 And Victoria's Secret was clearly the store of choice for men shopping for their wives. It even had two male employees on hand to answer questions from men who might be embarrassed about asking a female sales clerk about lacy lingerie.
 Retailers are not anticipating the sales bonanzas they reaped during the last two holiday seasons, when sales soared far beyond their expectations. Last year, holiday sales jumped 7.5 percent to 8.9 percent, depending on the definition of the season, and the increases were even greater the year before. Some analysts and economists measure holiday sales starting at the end of November through December, while others include the entire two months.
 The National Retail Federation is predicting a 6 percent sales increase this year, and most other analysts' estimates fall into that ball park. Tracy Mullin, president of the federation, said she expected retailers to ring up $425 billion in sales during the five-week period before Christmas, compared with about $400 billion last year.
 "Although last year was up about 7.5 percent over the previous year, we'll be very happy with a 6 percent increase," she said.
 Ms. Mullin cited a number of macroeconomic indicators that portend healthy holiday sales, including low unemployment, fairly stable consumer confidence and lower consumer debt.
 The personal financial outlook for many people out milling around in malls yesterday reflected those statistics.
 Last year, Jessie and Kevin Logan of Detroit limited their spending to practical gifts and basic needs because Mr. Logan had lost his job as a photographer for a Detroit advertising agency, forcing the young couple to rely on Mrs. Logan's income of $28,000 a year. "We had to be frugal," Mr. Logan recalled. "I got caught in corporate cost savings."
 This year, though, they were out shopping on Chicago's Michigan Avenue, in search of a Cartier watch for Mr. Logan and a new fur coat for Mrs. Logan. Mr. Logan has begun his own business and has landed several lucrative jobs making portraits of executives for annual reports. He expects his earnings as a freelance photographer to exceed his former salary.
 But even as they were splurging, the Logans were checking prices. Mr. Logan is prepared to spend as much as $4,000 for his wife's fur coat, "but we're looking around to seek what the different stores have to offer and get the best deal," he said.
 Some of the better deals in the country were available at I. Magnin stores, which are going out of business. At the store in Newport Beach, Calif., more than 100 would-be customers were waiting in line to buy designer merchandise at rock-bottom prices. "I got two Donna Karan outfits for dirt cheap," Elnora Dean boasted.
 She said she was spending less on presents this year because she and her husband, Donald, plan to travel to Australia after Christmas to visit one of their children. The outfits she bought were for her grandchildren.
 Jean Reineke of Downey, Calif., who was waiting in line at I. Magnin, said that she planned to spend about the same amount on presents this year as she did last year, but that she might spend more if she found bargains.
 "I feel secure, but you never know from one day to the next," she said, noting that her husband, a computer analyst with the Xerox Corporation, would not be getting a year-end bonus this year.
 "You never know" was a popular phrase among shoppers yesterday. Many had lost a job within the last three years or knew a close friend or relative who had. Glenn Bonner was laid off three years ago from his job as a production worker at a General Dynamics plant near Fort Worth.
 Even though his new job is more secure -- he works for his brother-in-law's company -- he is making less. Yesterday, he was looking for clothes for his two sons and hoping to pay for them with cash. "Nothing is ever a sure thing, so I try not to get too deep in debt in case something happens," he said. "You never know."
 Traffic at the Ridgmar Mall in Fort Worth, where Mr. Bonner was shopping, seemed less congested than last year, and at Stamford Town Center early yesterday, the pace was more like a busy Saturday than the first day of the holiday shopping season -- even though several strollers caused momentary gridlock near the lines of families waiting to visit Santa Claus. But at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, L.I., the vast parking lot was full and some cars were turned away.
 In midtown Manhattan, shopping areas seemed as crowded as ever for the Friday after Thanksgiving, with people waiting in line to get into F.A.O. Schwarz -- and also Nike Town and the Warner Brothers Studio Store.
 Mary-Beth Sherbo, visiting from Agawam, Mass., waited outside Planet Hollywood on 57th Street in Manhattan for an hour and a half at lunchtime. She had almost finished buying toys and games for her children, who are ages 5 and 6.
 For her friends, she said, she planned "more gift certificates," adding, "They are easier, and there are no lines."
 But for some people, the hustle-bustle is an immutable part of the holidays, like Hannukah gelt, gaudy ornaments and candy canes.
 "We come into Macy's every year on the day after Thanksgiving," said Ann Mason, who lives in New Jersey and was cheerfully elbowing her way through the crowd in Macy's flagship store on Herald Square. "It sort of gets you into the spirit, even if you don't buy anything."

The Shroud

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
A GREAT SHROUD has been drawn across the mind of America to make it forget that there is a world beyond its borders. Except when showing "Star Trek" or some imitation, the three main television networks obsessively focus their cameras on domestic tales and dramas, as if the end of the cold war rendered the rest of the planet irrelevant. Their news staffs occasionally visit some massacre, famine or shipwreck and their star anchors may parachute into Haiti or Kuwait for a photo op, but these spasms of interest only emphasize the networks' apparent belief that on most evenings the five billion folks out there don't matter one whit.
Midst all the agitation about immigrants in California and Texas, have you seen even one good report on the 23 million refugees roaming the globe? Or the response to immigrants in Germany or, if it could be found, Canada? After all the hype given to Charles Murray's portentous I.Q. alarm, did you catch even a single network asking what other societies think about intelligence tests? Or what they've learned about the relationship between talent and economic growth? 
 Americans who grew up with the trauma of Vietnam have heard virtually nothing about Vietnamese society since the war or about Vietnam's discovery, like Russia's and China's, that our vaunted market system corrupts even as it enriches. Not a peep anywhere about the economic boomlet in India, whose progress Americans once judged to be a challenge for democracy. Hardly a glimpse of South Africa since Nelson Mandela's triumph, as if Americans had no conceivable interest in black-white societies. No TV viewer keeping normal hours could learn that Latin America has largely abandoned military rule and repression, restructured a decade of devastating debt (to American banks!) and elected a cast of reform-minded leaders.
Some people might argue that none of this matters now that the fear of war has evaporated, now that no Russians compete for influence in Indonesia and no hostile forces rule in Ethiopia. But do other peoples offer Americans only the competitions of war and trade? Is there nothing to be learned about how the Swedes and French care for their elderly? How Italy, the Pope's home, deals with abortion? How Brazilians handle drug addiction?
IT TAKES NO JOURNALISTIC genius to propose these story ideas; I've culled most of them from one week's Economist, Time and Newsweek. Telling those stories in interesting, even dramatic, ways is no more difficult than explaining the pros and cons of a balanced-budget amendment or of admitting DNA evidence in a criminal trial. What's been lost at the television networks is perspective on the world, the passion to learn, to explore, to employ the educational force of the camera.
And money to do the job.
The Fox network seems content to operate without much national or foreign news. It lives by the standards of its creator, Rupert Murdoch, who gives no sign in any of his media ventures that he regards communication as a calling.
Ted Turner, who does, struggles to stretch his all-news Cable News Network around the globe. But the journalism that he can afford is constrained by his small share of television's audience and advertising.
So America still depends on ABC, CBS, NBC and their affiliates, which have been draining advertising dollars from magazines and newspapers for decades without investing nearly enough in reporting. They've killed the weekly brilliance of a Life and other magazines and destroyed the competition that invigorated urban dailies. And now the networks are diverting still more millions of dollars from reporting to gossip and blather.
Obviously, the quest for mass audiences that TV advertisers demand has always put a premium on entertainment. But the prior generation of TV moguls, who created the networks, grudgingly acknowledged that their great power -- and the Federal monitors of that power -- imposed an obligation to render public service. They paid their dues with large, costly news departments and a fitful schedule of superb documentaries.
Today, each network pretends to "cover" the world with seven or eight full-time correspondents; none of them breathe the air of South America and few ever tour Asia or Africa. For filler, they buy footage from foreign networks and part-timers. To be sure, when American troops are sent abroad and when the President sojourns at a colorful (or comfortable) foreign summit, the great anchors -- Jennings, Rather and Brokaw -- can be found reading the nightly news from a distant beach or rooftop. But their customarily swift return pronounces even those foreign stories instantly dead. (Heard much from Haiti lately?)
The corporate chairmen who preside over the networks surely think of themselves as worldly citizens. But there is no evidence that Thomas S. Murphy of Capital Cities/ABC, John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric (NBC) and Laurence A. Tisch of CBS have ever challenged their broadcasters to spend an extra few hours or dollars to enlarge the perspective of their audiences. When they do give the news division a prime-time hour -- usually after entertainment has failed to outdraw a competing show -- they insist on a "magazine" of marginal investigations and trivial features whose main appeal at headquarters is that it can be produced for less than a sitcom.
ARE NEWSPAPERS any better? Not many. USA Today, which proclaims itself a model for the future, normally devotes more space to the United States weather map than to all foreign news. The New York Times reserves prime space for the reports of three dozen full-time correspondents abroad; The Los Angeles Times maintains almost as many. The Washington Post fields a foreign team of 24; so does The Wall Street Journal (plus 60 more on the roster of its European and Asian editions). The Christian Science Monitor and The Chicago Tribune each still keep a dozen reporters overseas. But given the networks' modest effort, America's picture of the planet is painted by a total of only 400 American correspondents, including those from news magazines and wire services, plus a few hundred foreign nationals assisting them.
That leaves too many people depending upon the eyes of too few. And what journalism neglects, politics will inevitably ignore. A shallow understanding of the world will damage the nation's sense of itself, its commerce and its standard of living and may blind it to even greater threats. Will Americans end this century more isolationist than when it began?

HEADLINE: The Widow Gets Her Verdict

BYLINE: By Claudia Dreifus; Claudia Dreifus is a contributing writer to the Magazine.

 BODY:
ON LABOR DAY MORNING, Myrlie Evers, 61, widow of Medgar Evers, the slain civil rights legend, stood on a platform in Jackson, Miss., and cut ribbons dedicating the Medgar Wiley Evers Post Office Building. A church choir sang "He's So Wonderful." Mississippi politicians, black and white, made speeches. Two blocks away, Byron De La Beckwith, 73, who was convicted in February of the Evers murder in 1963, sat at the Hinds County Detention Center. "I chuckled at the thought that the jail was so close," Myrlie Evers said after the festivities. She is a handsome woman, tall, with a spark in her chestnut eyes. "I hope he heard everything," she went on. "I want him to understand how much he's motivated me all this time."
The journey that brought Myrlie Evers to this sweet moment of justice took her 31 years to complete. In June 1963, her husband, the field secretary of the Mississippi N.A.A.C.P., was gunned down in front of the family home in Jackson. The killing was among the first of that decade's political assassinations and a turning point in the civil rights movement. President John Kennedy dedicated his ground-breaking civil rights legislation to Evers's memory. Within days of the funeral, Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, was charged for the first time with the murder. He was tried twice in 1964; both times, all-white juries deadlocked, creating mistrials. Though strong evidence linked Beckwith to the killing, and though he himself dropped hints of involvement, the Hinds County prosecutor eventually dismissed the murder charges. 
 With the killer free, Myrlie Evers led two parallel lives. She moved to California, where she raised her children -- Darrell, Reena and James (now 41, 40 and 34), took on a career in fund-raising and public relations, and married Walter Williams, a labor activist. Today she lives in Oregon and travels the lecture circuit. All the while she kept constant tabs on events back home, monitoring Beckwith's whereabouts, always seeking a way to reopen the case.
The break came in 1989, when The Jackson Clarion-Ledger began investigating the activities of the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, a secret agency that operated in the 1950's and 1960's. Commission documents pointed to possible jury tampering and official involvement in Beckwith's second trial. With this fresh information in hand, Myrlie Evers pressured Mississippi officials to move for a new trial.
On Feb. 5, almost 30 years to the hour of the first trial, a racially mixed Hinds County jury found Beckwith guilty of murder. "I didn't realize how deeply implanted this need to clear everything up was," Evers explained later. "When it was over, every pore was wide open and the demons left. I was reborn when that jury said, 'Guilty!' "
 
 Q: Of all the civil rights widows, you seem to be the only one who has carved out an independent life.
A: I'm not sure that's really accurate. Betty Shabazz, Malcolm's widow, went back to college and got her doctorate. She's an administrator at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. Let's just say that I have not depended on Medgar's name. I'm the only one who's remarried. None of the other widows have ventured off into areas such as politics, corporate America -- where you bear yourself to all kinds of criticism.
 
Q: You are a vice chairman of the board of the embattled N.A.A.C.P. -- an organization now in crisis. Benjamin Chavis has been purged as executive director amid charges of financial mismanagement and sexual harassment. The chairman, Dr. William Gibson, has been accused of charging up nearly a half-million dollars in expenses. Do you worry for the association's future?
A: It will survive. But what will it be? People are drifting away. We need strong leadership, which I hope will include more women at the helm. We need leaders who guard the monies of the association very carefully -- and who do not abuse the privileges that come with leadership.
 
Q: Are you thinking of seeking Chavis's old post?
A: I'm not the least bit interested in becoming executive director. That's a 24-hour job with constant travel. However, I have been encouraged by some leaders to run for chairman of the board. My husband, Walter Williams, is not well and his health is a big determining factor in whatever I do. I have the financial background, the overall commitment, a 40-year association with the N.A.A.C.P.

Q: How is it that an organization that has given the world heroines like Rosa Parks and Daisy Bates has so few women in top positions?
A: I believe that many of the men think of the women as nice decorations and are perhaps not even aware that there's a problem. The president is a woman, but we don't need tokens. Women are mostly on the very soft committees, where no major decisions are made that directly impact the operation of the organization.
The women of the association are more than ready to assert themselves and to call the hand of those males who have not guarded the association as carefully as they should have.

Q: On the subject of Byron De La Beckwith -- why was it so important to go after him when so much time had passed?
A: Because Beckwith committed a crime and he still boasted about it. I saw it as a moral issue. A society should not allow murderers to go free. People long for justice, you know.
In the end, the trial had a good effect on Mississippi. A poll before the trial by The Clarion-Ledger showed the public very much against trying Beckwith again. Another poll after the verdict read just the opposite. Mississippi has always been known as the poorest state and one filled with racism. I have watched Mississippi try to make progress, try to get accepted. Getting this verdict helped.

Q: What do you recall of the atmosphere in Jackson in the spring of 1963?
A: The tension. For years, ever since 1954, when my husband accepted the position of N.A.A.C.P. field secretary of the state of Mississippi, we knew his life was on the line. In the spring of 1963, Medgar was leading economic boycotts of downtown businesses discriminating against our people. In the Jackson newspapers, there were editorials calling for "a flow of blood" in the streets, pinpointing Medgar as someone something should be "done" about.
Over the 11 years of our marriage, we had often spoken about the possibility of assassination. But in the spring of 1963 we spoke of it constantly. A dear friend, Dr. Felix Dunn of Gulfport, Miss., told my husband of a plan to wipe him out. Dr. Dunn had seen a death list with the names of 10 civil rights leaders on it. Medgar was No. 1. It was a white person [who knew people in the Ku Klux Klan] who had shown Dr. Dunn this list.
In the days before Medgar was killed, there was almost a morbid presence about him. It got to the point where he said, "Take care of my children." The last morning he was at home, he kissed us all and went out to the car and came back again. That night, Medgar went to an N.A.A.C.P. meeting. The children and I stayed home to watch President John Kennedy give a civil rights speech. We heard the motor of Medgar's car. The car pulled in the driveway. Then, a rifle blast. I ran to the door. Medgar was still alive. Every drop of blood was coming out of him.
Afterwards, I remember thinking, "I'm going to make whoever did this pay."

Q: When did you first hear the name Byron De La Beckwith?
A: A few days after Medgar's death. The rifle had been left in the bushes and the dew had frozen the thumb print. I knew he was the assassin from the first photographs printed of him. There was a wound on his eye from the rifle's telescopic sight.

Q: Were you surprised by the speed of the first two trials?
A: Yes. At first, I thought nothing was going to be done. I had lived in Mississippi all my life and could not recall a single conviction of a white for killing an African-American. I recall a meeting with Bill Waller, the prosecutor in the 1964 trial, and I asked him how he planned to address me in court. He said: "You were born here. You know how things are." I told him, "Mr Waller, if you address me as anything other than 'Mrs. Evers,' I will protest in court because respect is one of the things my husband died for." In court, he called me . . . nothing.

Q: What did you feel when you first came face to face with Beckwith?
A: Anger and hatred. This was when I went to court to testify during the first trial. Beckwith had this smirk on his face. He was very pleased with the publicity. You could tell from the way he looked at me that I was a nonentity to him. But I stared at him and our eyes locked.
While I was testifying, the Governor, Ross Barnett, walked in -- I'll never forget this -- and he paused and looked at me, turned and went to Beckwith, shook his hand, slapped him on the shoulder and sat down next to him. He was sending a clear signal to the jurors that this man was to be acquitted.

Q: Those first few months of widowhood must have been terrible.
A: I was 30. I had dropped out of college to marry Medgar when I was 18 and now I had children, ages 3, 8 and 9, looking to me. Medgar had made $6,100 a year and had left me with thousands of dollars of debt. The N.A.A.C.P. said, "If you'll make appearances on our behalf, we'll continue to pay his salary." I did it. Every weekend I was away making speeches. My eldest son began to fear that I, too, would be killed. He stopped talking and he could not hold down his food. And I was suicidal. The only reason I struggled to stay alive was the promise I'd made to Medgar to take care of the children.
It became difficult for the family to have any semblance of recovery as long as we lived in that house. The blood remained on the concrete. The refrigerator still had the dent from the bullet that had passed through Medgar's body. There was nowhere in Mississippi I wanted to live. Medgar and I had always talked about how, if we ever left the state, we'd go to California.
I felt very guilty about leaving. We moved to Claremont, a college town 30 miles from Los Angeles. I enrolled in Pomona College -- so that I could get a degree. Only when we arrived there did I realize that Claremont was all white. On the whole, the new environment proved good for the children, though I would have liked a more balanced racial mix. Sundays, I took them to nice restaurants, something we'd been barred from back home. There was satisfaction in finishing my education and having a career. After my graduation, the Claremont Colleges hired me as development director. I ran for Congress in 1970 as a Democrat and won 36 percent of the vote in a traditionally Republican district. In the campaign I did not run as "Mrs. Medgar Evers," but rather as Myrlie Evers. I was beginning to develop my own identity. In the next few years, I would go on to work as director of community affairs for Atlantic Richfield, as a columnist for Ladies' Home Journal.

Q: How did you meet your second husband, Walter Williams?
A: At the Claremont Colleges. He phoned and asked to show me a likeness he'd made of Medgar. He was a longshoreman, active in his union, and a civil rights fighter from way back. We began having dinner and became friends. It's been a wonderful marriage and I'm in awe of the way Walter handles Medgar's memory. In many ways, the marriage has been "Walter, Myrlie and Medgar." For any man to understand that is rare.

Q: You managed to keep on the case even from California.
A: I had to return to Mississippi several times annually to see my elderly parents. Whenever I was there, I inquired, "Have you heard anything about this man?" Beckwith ran for lieutenant governor in Mississippi. He spent some time in prison for attempting to bomb a Jewish leader in Louisiana. After some years, people said: "Myrlie, you're living in the past. Let it go." But the fact that no one had been found guilty made it hard to let go. And Beckwith couldn't keep his mouth shut. I thought, "Keep talking -- one of these days you're going to give yourself away."

Q: How did the break in the case finally come?
A: President George Bush had asked my brother-in-law, Charles Evers, to do something nice for Jonas Savimbi [the Angolan guerrilla leader]. So Charlie invited him to Mississippi and presented him with the Medgar Evers Award for Achievement to Humanity, or something like that. I hit the ceiling. A reporter with The Clarion-Ledger, Jerry Mitchell, phoned me about that and mentioned he'd been working on an expose of the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission. It would later turn out that he had some records of the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission and that he thought that there was enough evidence there to seek a new trial because the jury in the second trial had been tampered with.
It was something to get started with. I called the Hinds County District Attorney's office and asked for an appointment. The first meeting was nasty. "It can't be done. This is too old a case to try to resurrect. We don't have the files anymore." That was what the District Attorney, Ed Peters, told us.
Sitting on a sofa, the assistant district attorney, Bobby DeLaughter, held up the case file, which had two or three pieces of paper in it, and sighed, "Mrs. Evers, this is all we have." Well, that's a start, I told him.
And we had Federal, state, city and county officials adding their clout to the demand for a new trial. The Jackson City Council passed a resolution asking for the case to be reopened.

Q: A key piece of evidence, the murder weapon, had been lost. It would turn up in the private collection of a Mississippi judge. How did that happen?
A: It's really weird, isn't it? I'm not sure that the real story has been told yet. But that wasn't the only missing evidence. The photos from the first trial had disappeared. One day, the District Attorney was called anonymously and told to expect them. We needed to find the witnesses after 27 years -- we had a wonderful, aggressive investigator named Crisco, who found people where and when they were still alive. Bobby DeLaughter called me and said, "We have to drop the case without a transcript and we don't have one." I answered: "When do you need it? I have a certified carbon I've been saving for my children."
I was a woman driven. I lived and breathed the case. The hardest part came when the Mississippi Supreme Court was deciding whether or not they would allow a new trial. It took them forever to make a decision. So I went to the press and complained. There was such foot-dragging, but eventually we got that trial.

Q: How was the third trial different from the first two?
A: The trial was actually held in the same Hinds County courtroom where the other two had been. But in the first two trials, we had only white males on the jury. This time, we had males, females, Caucasians and African-Americans. This time, I was always addressed as "Mrs. Evers." New witnesses came forward, too. A former Klansman named Delmar Dennis testified that at a Klan meeting Beckwith had said that, "Killing that nigger gave me no more inner discomfort than our wives endure when they give birth to our children." There was also a woman who said she was in a restaurant where she heard Beckwith bragging about killing Medgar. She'd been too frightened to speak up before.
The night before the verdict was difficult, because everyone had expected a very short deliberation. By 6 or 7 of the first evening, with no verdict, I thought, "Oh, we're in trouble." Then came the verdict, and I thought, "Yessss . . . Medgar!"

Q: Rumor has it that Fred Zollo, producer of "Mississippi Burning" -- a movie that many civil rights leaders found offensive -- is preparing a feature film on your campaign to prosecute Beckwith.
A: As I understand it, the movie is a fictional story and will not be solely based on Medgar and myself. He has bought the rights to a book about Medgar's case. It doesn't bother me that Bobby DeLaughter will be the main character, because he deserves so much praise. I am apprehensive, however, about how Medgar and I will be portrayed. Will Medgar come across as someone afraid of his shadow? I certainly will be watching developments carefully. And with legal counsel.

Q: Your second husband is now quite ill. Does that bring back some of the pain of losing Medgar?
A: This is different. With Walter, there's time for us to talk, to find comfort, to work through the fear and the pain of losing each other. Medgar's death was violent, and there's something about violence that tears out your innards.

Q: In Mississippi there's a debate on whether all the files of the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission should be opened to public inspection. Where do you weigh in?
A: I feel it's important to have those files open so that we can see the evil that prejudice and racism breeds. There was information included in the files that helped secure a third trial in Medgar's case and perhaps there will be similar information in opening up some of the other Mississippi murder cases.
 
Q: Do you ever wonder what Medgar would be doing if he had lived?
A: He'd be an elected official of the state of Mississippi. He used to say, "The day will come when enough of our people are voting and we will have elected officials and I plan to be one." I'm so proud that Mississippi has the largest number of African-American elected officials in the country. That's a tribute to Medgar and all the others.

Q: And how do you think he would like the person you've become?
A: After the verdict, my two sons asked me, "Ma, do you think Daddy could have dealt with you now?" I said, "It'd be pretty tough on the old guy, but I think he'd be proud." And he is proud, if there is such a thing as reaching beyond.

A Glittering 'Sunset' Rises

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
IT'S HERE AND IT'S A STUNNER. IF YOU HAVE TO ASK what "it" is, you haven't been paying attention. It's "Sunset Boulevard," Andrew Lloyd Webber's grand, sometimes to the point of grandiose, musical reincarnation of Billy Wilder's comparatively spare, satiric 1950 melodrama about a titanic Hollywood legend. She's Norma Desmond, the epitome of camp, a forgotten but not gone silent-film star. As played and sung by Glenn Close, the Dracula-like Norma is now shaking the I-beams and testing the acoustics at the Minskoff Theater on Broadway in a manner to set precedents. Never has someone undead been so alluring, so entertaining and, finally, so crazily tragic.
Yet "Sunset Boulevard" is something more than a bizarre Broadway spectacle scored with some of Mr. Lloyd Webber's loveliest melodies and designed with an extravagance of mind more usually evident at a theme park. In adapting the classic film for the stage, the composer and his collaborators haven't only pumped up and inflated the Wilder work. They have also created something original. 
 "Sunset Boulevard" doesn't change the course of the musical theater. However, as a meditation on movies, and on the way that movies have altered our perceptions of ourselves, it explores territory touched only in passing (if touched at all) in earlier literature inspired by movies. I'm thinking of everything from F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Last Tycoon" and Nathanael West's "Day of the Locust" to Buster Keaton's "Sherlock, Jr.," the Gene-Kelly-Stanley-Donen "Singin' in the Rain" and, of course, the still monstrously funny Wilder film.
There's little in Mr. Lloyd Webber's musical that doesn't come directly from the film. Virtually everything in the Don Black and Christopher Hampton book and lyrics has its origins in the screenplay written by Mr. Wilder, Charles Brackett and D. M. Marshman Jr. Yet in its sardonically romantic music and lyrics this "Sunset Boulevard" makes palpable the curious gift bestowed by movies: the power to freeze time, to re-enter not a vaguely remembered past but a perfect replication of what once was. They blur the lines between past and present. Do we learn from them? Not Norma Desmond. Her old movies, which she watches nightly in her great, gilded Roxy Theater of a palazzo, are a mesmerizing mirror. Having passed through the mirror to the other side, her youth, beauty and fame remain as larger-than-life reflections to bewitch the aging Norma, who has become her own most lethal fan.
The scene is set in the first act when Ms. Close sings the haunting "With One Look (I Can Break Your Heart)," in which Norma evokes the particular (to us today, almost Kabuki) gestures of silent-film acting, which has become a dead language. The song is both a lament for what once was in the teens and 1920's and a reminder of what now is, at least for Norma in 1949, when the years have left her emotionally bereft, with no one to talk to.
This isn't a problem most of us face, but "Sunset Boulevard" turns it into a sly consideration of the cult-of-youth: the denial of time's passage that sends bank clerks and auto body mechanics, as well as society figures and movie stars, off for small nips and tucks, skin abrasions and perhaps a little liposuction. It may not be too much of a stretch to credit this obsession with attempts to deny that the political and economic world we inhabit is vastly different from -- not just older than -- that of our idealized past.
Norma is a volcanic character, and Ms. Close clearly appreciates it. She can belt in the lower registers and sing angelically in the upper ones. If she doesn't have the ease of range of Patti LuPone, who originated the role in the London production (and whose cast album is still the one to listen to), she has the effortless authority to dominate a huge production in a huge theater. Ms. Close also has the insinuating power to convince an audience that once she really was a great star. In the year since she opened in "Sunset Boulevard" in Los Angeles, she seems also to have come to look increasingly like Gloria Swanson, the former star of silents who played Norma in the film.
THE SENSATIONAL SWANSON "return" performance in the film was helped, at least in part, by the fact that the audience (wrongly) identified her with the role she was playing. Ms. Close, with the immense help of the Lloyd Webber songs that define Norma, creates the character out of sheer talent.
The show's other remarkable performance is that of George Hearn as Max Von Mayerling, the butler and keeper of Norma's flame, the role Erich Von Stroheim played for Mr. Wilder. Mr. Hearn's fluid baritone, coupled with his Von Stroheim severity, nearly brings the show to a halt with two numbers: the elegiacal and mordant "Greatest Star of All," when he remembers, among other things, how a maharajah once hanged himself with Norma's stocking, and a reprise of "New Ways to Dream" (first sung by Norma), in which the birth of movies is equated with nothing less than the dawn of time. Modest Hollywood.
IT'S A MEASURE OF THE WIT OF the show's best lyrics that even as they express Norma's enduring passion for herself and for movies in terms that are unexpectedly moving, they also stand at a slight remove to serve as a sarcastic commentary. In "Surrender," the show's most ruthlessly caustic number and one of its sweetest, Norma is at the makeshift bier of her beloved chimpanzee, seeing the chimp and herself as figures on a World War I battlefield. It's as if she were a doughboy dressed in gold lame drag. "Let them send their armies," she sings with loopy feeling. "I will never bend." That takes chutzpah, but it also expresses Norma's scary tenacity. Tenacity is all she has left.
Alan Campbell repeats the role he had in the Los Angeles production: Joe Gillis, the young, down-on-his-luck screenwriter who lands at Norma's Sunset Boulevard mansion trying to escape a pair of repo men who are after his car. First mistaken for an undertaker, Joe stays on. Norma hires him to polish her Proust-size script of "Salome," which she expects Cecil B. DeMille to direct. Soon Joe is her gigolo. Mr. Campbell's performance has grown considerably tougher since California, but he's no William Holden, who was the memorably panicked and opportunistic Joe in the film.
Mr. Campbell, a big, forceful singer, is partially undone by his blond preppy good looks, which are those of a musical-comedy juvenile, not of a character lead. The performance comes together when he's playing directly with Ms. Close, catering to Norma's whims, wrestling with his own conscience and, near the end of the first act, in a lilting number titled "The Perfect Year," when he is briefly carried away by Norma's adoration of him.
The show doesn't just seem to stop when Norma is offstage. It's a beached whale. It's as if everybody had lost their senses, including Trevor Nunn, the otherwise knowing, rational, wizardly director. The subplot, involving Joe and Betty Schaefer (Alice Ripley), the studio secretary he loves, is scored with relentlessly monotonous recitative and a third-rate song ("Too Much in Love to Care"), staged in a faux-naif style not seen on Broadway in possibly 40 years. Ms. Ripley also has a fine voice, but the air around her is dead.
Norma is never offstage for very long, and when she's on, the fur, with which Anthony Powell has expensively decked her, flies in all directions. Watch Norma as she tears up and down the baroque staircase that is the centerpiece of John Napier's gorgeous double-decker set. Or, as she sits in her gold mausoleum responding to herself playing Joan of Arc. Or, as she makes her (she thinks triumphant) return to the Paramount studio where DeMille (Alan Oppenheimer) is shooting "Samson and Delilah." Though "As if We Never Said Goodbye" is not the climax of the show, the number is its big, all-out, heartbreaking center. There shouldn't be a dry eye even in the lobby.
"Sunset Boulevard" is nothing if not eclectic: a Gothic tale distantly related to "The Castle of Otranto," a pop opera that recalls the prettiness of Puccini, a sound-and-light show topped by a mad scene that in its ferocity makes Lucia di Lammermoor's seem understated.
Mostly, though, "Sunset Boulevard" is about the way movies beguile their audiences, the people who make them and time itself.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
'Vita and Virginia'
 "I simply adore Virginia Woolf," Vita Sackville-West (Vanessa Redgrave) confides to the audience at the beginning of "Vita and Virginia," now at the Union Square Theater Off Broadway. The time is 1922. Vita, who has just met Virginia for the first time, continues: "She is both detached and human, silent till she wants to say something and then says it supremely well. She dresses quite atrociously."
Says Virginia Woolf (Eileen Atkins) of Vita, also speaking directly to the audience: "Not much to my severer taste -- florid, mustached, parakeet-colored, with all the supple ease of the aristocracy but not the wit of the artist." Yet Virginia is intrigued by the 30-year-old Vita, 10 years her junior: "She is a grenadier; hard, handsome, manly, inclined to a double chin. She is a pronounced Sapphist and may, thinks Ethel Sands, have an eye on me, old though I am."
Thus begins what may have been Virginia Woolf's only serious affair of the heart, more intense than anything she had ever experienced before. After several years it turned into a friendship that like the affair itself was conducted mainly through letters. Taking the correspondence of these two remarkable women, Ms. Atkins has put together "Vita and Virginia," a fascinating theatrical event played by two of the finest actresses in the English-speaking world. It's not quite a play, but it is a performed piece, not a reading; it's like a literary tea-for-two where the talk is witty, sometimes schoolgirlish, anecdotal, often brilliant and far more passionate and personal than a casual eavesdropper might realize.
At the time they met, Virginia, a novelist and critic, was already a formidable presence on the London literary scene. She was a founding member of the Bloomsbury group, whose writers and artists were in noisy rebellion against Victorianism. With her husband, Leonard Woolf, she helped found, run (and often set type for) the Hogarth Press, dedicated to the publication of new and experimental work. She was subject to mental breakdowns and was severely inhibited in all matters sexual. That is, until she was swept away by Vita.
The aristocratic Vita was something else. Married to Harold Nicolson, who had his own homosexual affairs, Vita was a figure of some literary note and a flamboyant, aggressive lesbian. Her earlier headlong affair with Violet Trefusis is hilariously recounted in "Portrait of a Marriage," written by Vita's son Nigel Nicolson.
Ms. Atkins's text presents the correspondence alternately as spoken letters and as dialogue composed by intercutting sections from the letters. As directed by Zoe Caldwell, the piece is played against a backdrop suggesting an idealized English countryside, something you might come upon while walking the grounds of a great manor house. The stage is bare but for a couple of benches, a stool and a table. Sound effects are supplied as needed.
Ms. Redgrave's Vita is a tall, bold goddess of the hunt in search of literary approval, escape from boredom and lovers. She has a good mind but often sounds like an Evelyn Waugh character: "Harold said yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons was glum in the extreme" (the day Franco's leadership of Spain was recognized by Britain). As she strides about the stage, she enchants the skeptical, vulnerable Virginia as much by her enthusiasm as by her own patrician beauty and manners. No wonder she inspires Virginia to write "Orlando." Ms. Redgrave is the androgynous Orlando made flesh.
Having already played Virginia in "A Room of One's Own," Ms. Atkins is even more at home here. She's the adored Vita's perfect audience and severest critic, temporarily overcome by feelings she's analyzing even while she's cataloguing them. When she talks of writing, it's with a clarity Vita can understand, though it's beyond Vita's talents to benefit. This is a piercingly honest and occasionally extremely funny performance. It also recognizes Virginia's profound melancholy, without ever presuming to explain its origins.
Ms. Caldwell is hard put to give the piece theatrical movement, but the actresses are so alive and vivid it's a theoretical problem. The movement is in the language, ideas and emotions. Toward the end, it's apparent that there's going to be no neat climax. "Vita and Virginia" winds slowly down and stops. No matter. As in the relationship it explores, the time has come to move on.

Northern Ireland Hopes For a Brighter Image

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
BOMB-SHATTERED storefronts and British soldiers in full combat gear patrolling blighted neighborhoods are hardly images conducive to building tourism, but they have been the reality in Northern Ireland for decades, at least in Belfast and other cities across the province.
But now, with the terrorist organizations on both sides of the Northern Ireland conflict having declared cease-fires and pledged themselves to the peace process, the British Government has high hopes for promoting a more attractive image of Northern Ireland and stimulating a big increase in tourism. 
 Instead of subjecting visitors to police checkpoints, tourism officials want to show off what they consider to be Northern Ireland's forgotten natural beauty, its golf and other recreational activities and its charming towns and villages.
"This is a tremendous milestone in our development and a great opportunity," said Hugh O'Neill, head of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. "There's a lot of catching up for us to do."
After falling from 1.08 million visits in 1967 to 435,000 visits in 1972 as violence flared, travel to Northern Ireland has been growing steadily in recent years.
Officials said their main hope was to draw more tourists from mainland Britain and the Republic of Ireland, which last year accounted for 85 percent of 1.26 million visitors to the province.
But they also have high hopes for luring more tourists from the United States, particularly by encouraging Americans who visit the Republic of Ireland to travel north across the border to see what the six counties of Ulster have to offer.
Currently only 13 percent of Americans who visit Ireland travel to Northern Ireland during their trips, and Mr. O'Neill said he would like to increase that proportion to 50 percent.
To take advantage of the positive publicity surrounding the peace process, the tourist board has requested an additional 3 million pounds from the British Government, or nearly $5 million, for marketing and promotion activities between now and April.
Those funds would be on top of the 8 million pounds, or $13.2 million, already budgeted for the board's activities in this fiscal year, which ends in April.
The board is also putting together applications to the European Union for financing to encourage more hotel and resort development. And Mr. O'Neill said he was hopeful that the International Fund for Ireland, an economic development authority financed primarily by the United States and the European Union, would increase spending on projects to boosttourism.
Mr. O'Neill said the board would continue its advertising campaign in Britain and Ireland, which uses the theme, "You'll never know until you go." And he said the board would step up efforts to persuade travel agents and travel writers to take another look at Northern Ireland.
Among other efforts, Mr. O'Neill said he was talking to American Airlines about starting a scheduled charter service between the United States and Belfast, which has an international airport but is not currently served by any flights to or from the United States.
"People think we're totally unprepared for tourism, like Vietnam," Mr. O'Neill said. "That's not the case. We have a thriving, if small, tourism trade. We have good infrastructure, growing amounts of accommodation and plenty of attractions for visitors."
Tourism officials said the biggest attraction in Northern Ireland is the Giant's Causeway, a spectacular set of 40,000 stone columns created by ancient volcanic eruptions on the north coast of Antrim. They said that the suspension of violence would help lure more golfers to first-rate courses like Royal Portrush, on the north coast in Portrush, and Royal County Down, near Newcastle.
For travelers looking for exhibits about the province's tangled political history, the two-year-old Tower Museum in London derry contains what all sides agree is an even-handed portrayal of ancient and recent history.
There is a lot riding on the tourism effort. Along with attracting new foreign investment for factories, tourism is at the top of the list of potential job creators for Northern Ireland, whose economy has been kept afloat through more than two decades of strife largely through grants from the British Government. A recent study by the Confederation of British Industry said increased tourism could create 3,000 jobs in the short run, on top of the 10,000 that already exist in the travel and tourism business, and that in the long run it could mean a doubling in the number of jobs, to 20,000.

HEADLINE: Widowhood and the Family Home

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
EDITH BLANCHARD sat across the table from her friend Lucy Hall in the vast dining hall at Evergreen Woods, a managed-care residence in Branford, Conn. She paused to dry her eyes.
"I'm surprised at the tears," she said, smiling and using a napkin to blot her eyes. "It's just . . . thinking of my house." 
 Mrs. Hall and Mrs. Blanchard, next-door neighbors for many years, were widowed within seven months of each other. Faced with the decision that affects almost every new widow or widower -- what to do with the home -- the two friends made different choices.
Mrs. Hall decided to move to Evergreen Woods but to keep her house overlooking the water in nearby Stony Creek, rent it out to a college professor for the school year and return there in the summers. Mrs. Blanchard decided -- well, perhaps didn't exactly decide -- to move to Evergreen Woods and sell her house.
"Not that it's anybody's fault," she said, "but when I signed the exclusive I didn't know I was putting my house on the market. I guess I thought it was a test run. It all happened so fast, and then there was a buyer and it was over with."
For the recently widowed, the choice of what to do with the family home is one of the most crucial decisions to be made. Although there is no statistical breakdown on how many make what choices, it seems clear from interviews that the decisions rest on four main factors: their health, the size of their current family home, where their children are living and, not surprisingly, their personal finances.
"What to do with the house is the major decision for a lot of widows and widowers," said Anne Studner, who heads a national widows' outreach counseling group for the American Association of Retired Persons in Washington. "The house makes up an average of one-third of their total assets.
"Unfortunately, housing issues are also a major point of pressure, especially from the children. We see it all too often: The children start campaigning to sell the house, either because 'Mom, you need the money,' or 'You're not safe alone.' "
Mrs. Studner explained that while there were more widows than widowers, the situation was similar for both.
"It also works the other way," she said. "The children will say, 'How can you even think of selling the house where we grew up and use as our home base?' Either way, it puts on unnecessary pressure.
"Giving advice is so touchy, but we try to ask them to consider only the decisions they must make right away. You do have to pay the utility bills and change the insurance; you don't have to worry about selling the house. I know a woman who sold her house immediately and moved across the country to join her children. That didn't work out and there she was -- with no house to go back to."
Melvin Cooper, president of Cooper Financial Services in Hamden, Conn., compares the feelings of many recently widowed to "boxers who are suddenly boxed into a corner. They should definitely wait six to eight months before making decisions about their house, until the dust settles."
Because many older widows and widowers may have bought homes for $15,000 to $20,000 in the 50's that are now worth $250,000, Mr. Cooper explained, there is a lot of money available from the sale of the house, but only if the widowed person feels comfortable selling.
"We call the value of the house a 'trapped asset,' " said Mr. Cooper. Using the example of the house that cost $20,000 to buy decades ago and was sold for $250,000, he explained how a homeowner over 55 years old could end up with $1,470 in monthly income.
By adding the original $20,000 purchase price to the $125,000 Federal tax write-off for homeowners 55 and over and subtracting the total from the $250,000 realized in the sale of the house, the owner would end up with a taxable gain of $105,000. Subtracting the 28 percent capital gains tax of $29,400 leaves the owner with a total of $220,600 for reinvestment. That amount, figured at an 8 percent investment income, would generate $17,648 a year, or $1,470 per month, before taxes. This monthly income, especially when coupled with other benefits the widow or widower is receiving -- such as Social Security -- could be used to pay the mortgage on a smaller house, to rent or to travel. "But don't forget, the economics can be there but the person's psychological well-being always comes first," Mr. Cooper said. "If they're not comfortable with selling the house, then the economics don't count."
They counted for Sylvia Alpert.
"FINANCIALLY, I was very scared," said Mrs. Alpert, executive assistant to the head of the Corcoran Group, a large Manhattan real estate company. "My husband's death devastated me and, because he had Alzheimer's and was sick for three years, I had seen everything we saved draining away."
"I realized I had to sit down and figure out the rest of my life, and I wanted to arrange things so I wouldn't have to depend on anyone," she said. "It's a numbers game. I knew I would have to sell the apartment because financially, the maintenance was a killer." Her postwar two-bedroom, two-bath apartment at 79th Street and East End Avenue was her major asset, but also her major liability. The monthly maintenance was $1,736.
Had she made her decision right after her husband, Ben, died four years ago, she said, she would have received a good deal more for the apartment than she did when she sold it this summer.
"But I couldn't even think of selling then," she said. "The thought of painting and cleaning the rugs -- the little things that have to be done when you sell -- and of making all these appointments with strangers to see it and always keeping it spotless -- it was still too emotional."
So she waited. And even though she made less when she sold her apartment on July 1, she believes she also paid less for her new place than she would have three or four years ago.
While Mrs. Alpert, like most of the others interviewed, declined to give the exact prices of her real estate, she said the difference between the selling price of the old apartment and the price she paid for the new one was approximately $100,000. Added to the $50,000 mortgage she took on the new apartment, she had $150,000 to invest for income, an amount she feels comfortable with. In addition, her new maintenance is $665, a $1,071-a-month saving.
Her new apartment, a postwar one-bedroom with dining alcove, is between Second and Third Avenues on East 66th Street. She compromised on the view (her old apartment had a terrace and faced the East River) and reduced the number of bathrooms from two to one. Nonetheless, Mrs. Alpert said she was delighted that she hadn't had to compromise on the size of the living room and master bedroom.
"I wanted glamour and I have it, in the kitchen and bath," she said, referring to her newly remodeled green marble bath and ultra-modern white kitchen. "I didn't want to feel I was demeaning myself and I don't. After all, this is for the rest of my life, unless I win the lottery."
While many widows and widowers take less living space, there are those who manage to increase it.
For Josephine Jones, who is now 74, being widowed let her take stock of her goals and arrange her life to satisfy them.
"In a way, I guess you could say it freed me up," she said, sitting in the rear parlor of the brownstone she bought 21 years ago on West 122d Street in Harlem. Although her husband left her with no money, Mrs. Jones, a professional party cook, worked as many as three jobs to send her daughter first to Dalton, the Upper East Side private school, then to Yale University.
"After that, I decided I wanted a brownstone," she said. She paid $21,000 for her house and is still restoring it. Although there is paint flaking from the downstairs ceilings and the house needs a lot of work, it will be well worth the effort: There is a fine fireplace, with original pre-Raphaelite faces on Minton tile and deep brown mahogany doors and galleried surrounds.
Mrs. Jones has no doubt that she would not have been able to afford the former rooming house had her husband not died. "His dying when he did was terrible," she said, "but it allowed me to focus on educating our daughter and buying this house. He wouldn't have let me work so much, and he wouldn't have wanted to buy this house. Men have different ideas."
ELLEN LEVY, whose husband, Robert N., a physician, died last March after a long illness, knew she would sell the four-bedroom ranch house on three-quarters of an acre in Roslyn Heights, L.I., where they had reared their three sons. To live in Manhattan would not be a completely new experience for her. Sitting in the 600-square-foot studio on East 54th Street that she and her husband had rented for "our escape, for four-day weekends," she explained how important the city was to them.
"We went to the theater, to the museums, walking," she said. "We always felt if one of us went that this was the place for the other one." Because Dr. Levy's illness was a long one, the couple was able to do some planning, but Mrs. Levy still waited a few months before putting the Long Island house on the market.
"When I got a buyer I went for the deal wholeheartedly," she said. "I'm not a tennis player or a golfer and my children's friends were no longer in the neighborhood, so it wasn't a big deal to them."
She put her house up for sale at the end of May and toured dozens of apartments with Judy Hans of the Halstead Property Company, before settling on a two-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot co-op apartment at 25 Sutton Place, a postwar building where some of her friends already live. She said she had had to pay more for the Sutton Place apartment -- which is undergoing a remodeling "demolition derby" -- than she got for the house. "But I was lucky," she said. "I had enough to buy this nice apartment."
Until the remodeling is complete she will remain in the studio, then sublease it.
Mrs. Levy advised suddenly widowed people to be especially careful in their choice of real estate lawyers and agents.
"It's a whole other story what happens to some women," she said. "Women don't necessarily have the same experience as men and there are so many contracts and papers they put in front of you to sign."
Sanford J. Schlesinger, partner in charge of trusts and estates at Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays & Handler and chairman of the New York Bar Association's trusts and estates section, agrees. "I always remind people they don't have to decide the day after the funeral," he said . "You may feel differently after three or six months."
Mr. Schlesinger said that it was important to know that real-estate listing agreements, one of the first legal documents that an individual who decides to sell a home will face, can be negotiated. In the standard preprinted listing agreement, he said, the broker is owed a commission if he or she delivers a buyer who agrees to either the listed price or to a reduced price that the seller has accepted. Instead, the seller may ask the realtor for a clause agreeing to pay the commission only when the property actually changes hands. This gives sellers -- who may be confused by grief -- more time to change their minds before parting with their house, he said.
With real estate agents, Mrs. Levy said, it might be advisable to ask for a short exclusive -- perhaps three months -- rather than the six months or even one year requested by most agents. She also negotiated a contract under which if she found a buyer herself, without the aid of the agent, she would pay only a 1 percent commission if she sold the house in the first month, with the percentage increasing with time and if the agent spent money and time on advertising and open houses.
"I was lucky to have a real estate lawyer who sat and discussed everything he does for his fee, every document he went through page by page," she concluded. "I'd tell women that if they start feeling hustled, they should speak up or find a new lawyer."
Mrs. Blanchard recalled that when she signed an exclusive listing agreement for her house in Stony Creek, she wasn't quite sure what it meant. (An exclusive listing agreement obligates an owner to either sell the house or pay the broker the commission if a buyer willing to pay a price that the seller has agreed to is found.) But she said that in the end she realized it would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep the Frank Lloyd Wright-style house on a bluff overlooking the water right above Mrs. Hall's house. It wasn't that the house itself was so big, she said, but that the sweeping, terraced grounds, with beds of exotic evergreens, needed "very, very expensive" manicuring.
"It wasn't something you could hire a high school kid to do," she said. And if I didn't do it, the place would've lost a lot of its value and couldn't be brought back."
MRS. BLANCHARD, who drives almost daily to bridge dates and concerts, nevertheless relies on a motorized cart to speed her along the carpet-lined corridors of Evergreen Woods. For her friend Mrs. Hall, it was the traces of Parkinson's disease that were beginning to show that prompted her to move in August 1993 to Evergreen Woods, with its $1,550-a-month carrying charges, which include hospitalization if needed.
Evergreen Woods units range from $210,000 to $240,000, with 85 to 90 percent of the cost reverting to the owners or their heirs if they move or die.
Both Mrs. Hall and Mrs. Blanchard's apartments are new and spacious, with high ceilings and light flooding in through double and triple small-paned windows and French doors. Mrs. Hall's apartment is on the second floor with a wooden balcony overlooking the lawn. It is furnished traditionally -- everything having come from the Stony Creek house -- with an Elizabethan portrait of a noblewoman and a footed mahogany curio cabinet full of treasures.
Mrs. Blanchard's one-bedroom apartment is on the first floor in a different wing and is furnished in a more relaxed, contemporary fashion, with a giant ticking-striped couch and stylized mauve fabric-covered chairs from the 60's.
"Yes, of course I miss my view," Mrs. Blanchard said, with the practiced pattern of someone who has made this comment before, "but look what I have -- my own little backyard and a stone wall."
With great enthusiasm, Mrs. Blanchard led a visitor out to the stone patio, with views of the woods beyond the development's stone wall.
"Look at those little pansies," she said, pointing to the hundreds of blue-faced flowers whose seeds had fallen from the windoxboxes of last season and were flowering promiscuously between the cracks of the stones. "Isn't it amazing? They've found another home."

HEADLINE: Should Historical Buildings Yield to Square Glass Boxes?

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
A GIANT metal claw started to rip away at the 100-year-old Laurel Street School in Branford one day late in October, only hours after a Federal judge in Hartford concluded that town officials had not acted unreasonably in deciding to demolish the school to make way for a new police station.
The destruction of the school was the culmination of a 10-month sometimes bitter battle between town officials and their supporters, who wanted to raze the school, and a citizens' organization known as SOS (Save Our School). Eventually the battle also involved the Connecticut Historical Commission and the State Attorney General's office, both of which favored retaining the school building as a historically important structure. 
 For the historical commission's director, John W. Shannahan, the demise of the old school meant one more folder he will add to a stack in a cabinet in his office. Each folder represents a lost cause, a sort of necrology of buildings Mr. Shannahan felt were important reminders of Connecticut's past.
The necrology includes structures like the huge 19th-century Whittemore summer home overlooking Lake Quassapaug in Middlebury, dismantled to be sold piece by piece by a salvage company; the old New Britain Opera House, still structurally sound but ignominiously reduced to showing pornographic movies, battered to earth by a wrecker's ball; the Hartford Aetna building, constructed in the early part of this century as the capital city's first skyscraper, imploded and tumbled to dust in the center of Hartford to make way for a new Society for Savings headquarters that to date has not materialized.
Of course, Mr. Shannahan said, not all worthy buildings receive such unworthy endings. Efforts of his commission and of non-governmental preservation organizations, sometimes working in concert, have been successful in saving some of them.
One of his favorites is the three-story yellow brick building near City Hall in Milford. It had been the city's high school at the turn of the century, but by the start of the 80's had degenerated into a prime example of municipal neglect, boarded up and falling apart. It was slated to be razed to make way for a new government complex, a plan supported by the local newspaper, The Milford Citizen. "It obviously is time that it goes," the newspaper commented editorially.
The building, however, did not go. It now contains 39 apartments for elderly people and is considered a prime example of a successful second life for an elderly building. After it was dedicated to its new use in 1993, The Milford Citizen admitted it had been too enthusiastic in seeking its demise. "Historic minds prevailed and the sow's ear became a silk purse," the newspaper then commented editorially.
But such successes are not often enough, Mr. Shannahan feels. Connecticut has destroyed, and keeps destroying, too many buildings with little regard for their historical significance or what they contribute to the overall architecture of a community. "People go to Disney World to see Main Street U.S.A.," he said. "We have them right here, but they're being destroyed.
"It's not that we went to keep all old buildings in the state," he said about his commission. "Many buildings are beyond hope. They should be torn down. We don't worship old buildings here. But there has to be a balance. Some buildings you can recycle. You can find new uses.
"People say, 'What's one building?' But you get one developer after another tearing down one building after another, and finally you have a city of square glass boxes."
Both major cities and smaller towns in the state have been guilty of excessive demolition, he said, but Hartford demonstrated the greatest zeal for destruction, particularly in the 80's. He described it as a frenzy, with developers rushing in to put up bigger and higher and more glitzy new buildings. "It just sort of got out of control. They were taking down buildings you can't replicate, you can't duplicate," Mr. Shannahan said.
Then, when the boom times ended, what Hartford had to show for the frenzy was a devastated central business section, lots of vacant lots where distinctive buildings had once been and a reputation as one of the poorest cities in the country. "Last Christmas, I went up to Main Street," Mr. Shannahan said, "and it struck me, all those vacant buildings and empty lots. The city has lost its identity."
Haven't cities elsewhere also lost their identities? Not to the same degree as Hartford, Mr. Shannahan said. "I'm a native of Boston," he said, "and when I go back there, I still get a feeling of history when I walk around. It's a nice feeling."
The sad fact, Mr. Shannahan said, is that there are very few safeguards when it comes to retaining the historical character of Hartford or other Connecticut cities.
The state does have a law on establishing historic districts, which makes it difficult to change or destroy old buildings within their boundaries. At present, there are 104 such districts in various parts of the state (although none in Hartford). But Connecticut is the only state that requires historic districts to be placed on the ballot, he said, and currently that means two-thirds of all property owners in a proposed district must vote to approve it.
Elsewhere, he said, it is easier to protect historical places and areas. "In New York City, Boston, Chicago, if the city designates a building as a landmark, that's it," Mr. Shannahan said. When the Penn Central Railroad wanted to put a high rise above Grand Central Terminal and the city refused to allow it, the case went to court. " And the court said the station represented the best use of the property, not the highest use," he said. It was a ruling that gladdened the heart of preservationists.
Connecticut also has a 1982 amendment to the state Environmental Protection Act that provides that before an old building of historic significance is torn down, it must be demonstrated that "feasible and prudent alternatives" for keeping the building have been explored. The problem is that the wording is subject to interpretation. What does "feasible" really mean? How much money does "prudent" mean?
Mr. Shannahan's best advice to municipal leaders is to examine what architectural history is left in the cities and then build on that base rather than continually tearing it down. The commission that Mr. Shannahan heads was established in 1955 at a time when cities were on the verge of massive changes. It has remained a tiny branch of government that today numbers only 19 full-time and 6 part-time employees. Its headquarters is in the Bull House near downtown Hartford, one of only a half-dozen 18th-century structures that remain in one of the country's oldest cities.
Perhaps the greatest irony about the commission is that it has had more than a bit of trouble preserving its own identity. In 1971, 1977 and 1992, attempts were made to merge the it into bigger state agencies. The latest attempt was by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. when, in his 1992-1993 budget, he proposed the transfer of the historical commission to the Department of Economic Development.
Members of the commission, backed by preservationists around the state, convinced the General Assembly that such a move was ill advised on the basis that the historical group oversees all state and Federal projects, to insure that they do not encroach on places of historic significance.

THE FUTURE OF DANCE
An opportunity to review contemporary dance trends will be offered at the Dance Theater Lab at Purchase College on Friday at 8 P.M. and Saturday at 2 and 8 P.M. The Saturday matinee will be followed by a discussion among dancers, choreographers and the audience.
The event is called "A New Generation of Dance in Westchester," and the featured dancer-choreographer is Wally Cardona, soloist with the Ralph Lemon Dance Company. Mr. Cardona will appear in the American premiere of a work he created on commission by Danscentrum in Stockholm.
All the remaining works, created and performed by emerging choreographers and dancers from Westchester and Rockland Counties, were selected by auditions on Oct. 30, or commissions awarded during the year by the Dance in Education Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in White Plains.
Judges at the auditions were Bessie Schoenberg, dance educator; Carol Walker, dean of Purchase College's dance department, and Kevin Ward, choreographer and teacher.
Dawn Watson's "Solas na Gealaigh," drawn from traditional Irish music and dance themes, will be presented along with Karen Schatten's "Haircut," Tim Martin's "Small Feats," Caroline Oxenham's "Driftwood" and Carl Flink's "Doodle for Bunny Boy," a segment of his "Field Songs" scheduled in its entirety at the 92d Street Y in Manhattan next month.
Works by Steven E. Williams, Lea Kraemer and Eun Me Ahn will also be performed to music ranging from Vivaldi to Dave Brubeck and Duke Ellington.
Tickets are $15, $10 for people 62 and older, $7.50 for students and $40 for patrons. Call 761-1118 for reservations or more information.
 
ALL ABOUT STAMPS
Michael Endres, owner of the Coin and Stamp Exchange in White Plains, will speak Thursday about stamps, the world's No. 1 hobby and the preferred investment for many collectors. The lecture is scheduled at 7:30 P.M. in the Greenburgh Public Library, 300 Tarrytown Road, Elmsford, and admission is free.
Mr. Endres is a certified philatelic appraiser and a member of the American Philatelic Society. He has been a dealer in White Plains for two decades and a stamp collector for 29 years.
"It's not a short-term investment," Mr. Endres said, "and to have a good long-term investment you should collect classical material in very good condition, not large quantities of modern issues."
He observed that good buying conditions have existed since 1988 when people started selling their holdings at discount prices during the recession. "Now we are seeing an increase in price and a shortage of supply," Mr. Endres said, because what was purchased in the recession "is being held by the buyers for future appreciation."
The Pacific Rim countries, especially China, are the hot spots for stamp collectors today, Mr. Endres said. "Some 1970's Chinese issues are extremely desirable," he said. "They were illegal to own or to use as postage in China because they contained inflammatory political slogans. The Government issued other stamps at the time with which to mail letters."
 
A MUSICAL UPDATE
Victor Herbert's "Babes in Toyland," produced as a touring holiday show by Troupe America under the direction of Curt Wollan, will be presented at Lehman College in the Bronx next Saturday at 2 and 7 P.M.
Decked out in new sets and costumes and accompanied by an ensemble, this version was written by William Mount-Burke and Alice Hammerstein Nathias. Performances will take place at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, at 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West. Tickets are $20, $22.50 and $25; children will be admitted for half price at the 7 P.M. performance, and discounts for the elderly are available. Call (718) 960-8833 for reservations or more information.
 
HOLIDAY BAZAAR
The Christmas ornaments that will be for sale next Saturday at the St. John's Episcopal Church Holiday Bazaar in Larchmont can be embellished by Grace Coughlin, a calligrapher who will inscribe them with names or messages.
From 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. the church's Parish Hall on Fountain Square will be filled with gift items handcrafted by parishioners, including knitwear, jewelry, stenciled place settings and topiary. In addition, there will be books, toys, antiques, textiles, electronic and sports equipment, a white elephant table and home-baked apple and pecan pies. Children will be kept occupied from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. in a special corner with arts and crafts, games and a confidential chat with Santa, and lunch will be served from noon to 2 P.M. For more information, call 834-2981.
 
JOHN JAY CHRISTMAS
The re-creation of Christmases past at historic sites provides a major source of entertainment, and the John Jay Homestead in Katonah, a New York State Historic Site, always puts on a first-rate show.
It will begin next Saturday with tours of the Federal-style mansion from noon to 5 P.M., continuing Sunday and the weekend of Dec. 10 and 11 at the same hours. The house will be decorated from top to bottom, and a full complement of antique crystal, china, silver and replicated 19th-century foods will be set up in the dining room. The parlor, where it was customary to adjourn for the last course of the Christmas dinner, will display desserts, and in the study, a punch bowl filled with citrus juices and Madeira will stand at the ready.
The decorations and foods have been carefully researched from notes left by the Jay family, and visitors who do not wish to be part of a tour may stroll through the house at will, guided by a descriptive brochure.
Special programs include Paul Peabody and his puppets on Dec. 10 at 1 and 3:30 P.M. Children may sit on the floor at the foot of the stage, but chairs will be available for parents. After each show, cookies and apple cider will be served.
On Dec. 11 the Bedford Bell Ringers will perform at 1 and 3:30 P.M. in the ballroom, and downstairs in the kitchen a costumed cook will talk about preparing Christmas feasts on an open hearth. Visitors will be offered samples from 19th-century recipes.
More than 5,000 come to the homestead holiday celebrations, and it is wise to arrive for the puppet and bell-ringer performances at least an hour early.
Daily admission is $6, $5 for children and people 65 and older. Proceeds help maintain the historic site on Route 22 off Exit 6 of I-684. Call 232-5651 for more information.

HEADLINE: Spain's Olive Growers Seek Their Day in the Sun - in the U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: JAEN, Spain

 BODY:
THIS provincial Spanish town, snug at the base of a mountaintop medieval castle, likes to think of itself as the Riyadh of olive oil.
Fields hereabouts that the Spanish poet Antonio Machado once described as "a sea of olive trees" -- there are 52 million of them, spread over 1.2 million acres -- yield fully 22 percent of the world's olive oil. So Jaen's olive growers cannot understand why they are being pushed around by the likes of France, Italy and Greece. 
 Though the Spaniards' oil is pure and unblended and buyers laud its body and flavor, Italian olive oil companies purchase more than one-third the harvest at cheap bulk prices, at times as low as $1.25 a pint, blend it with thinner Italian oils and, packaging it imaginatively, sell it as their own at a nice profit. So Jaen has been sending emissaries abroad, most notably to the United States, where last April they visited gourmet shops, food distributors and brokers in cities like New York, Philadelphia and Washington. New, fancy packaging is available, and the goal is to reach American gourmet shops and supermarkets to cash in on the growing taste for olive oil in the United States. A pint of Nunez de Prado, an extra virgin oil from nearby Cordoba, can fetch $38 in American gourmet shops.
"We've been too laid back, we waited for customers to come to us," said Jose Carlos Rey, a compact, 40-year old olive grower. "Now, people are talking about olive oil, so we have to go out looking for markets."
Like many farmers trying to prosper in today's increasingly competitive food business, Jaen's olive growers have invested heavily to improve their groves. Spending the equivalent of $32 million in recent years, they have set the trees farther apart to allow mechanized harvesting, and upgraded the pressing equipment that enables them to squeeze the olives the day of picking, to avoid losing flavor.
Yet upgrading the orchards may not help much if the growers cannot move their oil. With Europe awash in olive oil, as countries like Italy, Greece and France continue to produce more than saturated local markets can absorb, the growers have to go to countries where oil consumption is expanding, most notably the United States.
THE export drive has the full backing of the Government in Madrid, which is struggling to reduce a trade deficit that reached $19.3 billion in 1993, and $7.1 billion in the first five months of this year. The trade imbalance has frustrated the efforts of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to reduce the towering public spending deficit that, at 6.7 percent of Spain's gross domestic product, is a serious brake on the economy.
"The perception of Spain is Hemingway's. You know: bull fighting, the Civil War," said Juan J. Pindado, the director of the Spanish Industry Association's export promotion office in Washington, which sponsored last April's tour by the Jaen growers. "Nobody knows the regions of Spain or their products, like oil. We have to kill the Hemingway stereotypes."
The Jaen growers are banking on America's recent increased appetite for olive oil, after nutritionists praised its value in curbing heart ailments, and the fashionable cuisines of the Mediterranean world became popular in America, making it a staple in many kitchens. This year, United States olive oil imports are expected to reach 122,000 tons, up from 35,000 tons 10 years ago. Sales of Spanish olive oil in the United States have doubled from five years ago.
But even then, and while Spain remains the world's largest producer of olive oil, with one-third of world output, sales of its oil in the United States continue to lag behind those of oils from Italy and Greece, the world's No. 2 and 3 producers, respectively.
"I wouldn't say one is better. I would say Spanish oil is different than Italian oil," said Claude Mallinger, a vice president and director of purchasing at Sutton Place Gourmet in Bethesda, Md. "It is fruitier, and I won't use the word sweeter, but it has more flavor than, say, French olive oils."
"But to tell the truth, Italian oils are more popular," he said.
Juan Manuel Lopez, the secretary general of Jaen's business association, and a grower, said: "The Italians were successful because there was a great movement of Italians to the United States, and they remain loyal to the products of their former country."
American distributors agree with the assessment that the Italians got a head start. But they say the Spanish often cede the advantage by their lack of marketing drive.
Ernie Linnemann, of Haddon House Products in Medford, N.J., who met the growers from Jaen, said they had a wonderful product but failed to follow up initial contacts by sending samples.
Jason Folus, the purchasing director at C&G Distributors Inc. in Beltsville, Md., agreed: "The biggest problem with the Spanish is choosing a direction, and continuing on it."
Moreover, he said, Spanish producers had in the past often targeted the low end of the market. "They sold directly to retailers," Mr. Folus said, "therefore their oil was cheaper, so customers got the impression it was not as good."
Jaen's growers readily confess their sins.
"You have to be able to deliver on time, and the amount and quality you promised," Mr. Rey said. "In Europe that's not so important, and in Spain nobody bothers. But in the United States it's essential."
FOR the people of Jaen, olive oil is what greases the wheels of daily life.
Breakfast around here is often a toasted bun, rubbed with garlic and dipped in olive oil. Meals often begin with strips of bacalao, or dried cod, and the lengthy variety of local radish, rolled in olive oil and eaten with the fingers. A favorite dessert is a slab of sweetened whey, rolled in bread crumbs and fried in -- what else? -- olive oil.
Moreover, the local taste is for full-bodied oils, with a strong flavor, peppery aroma, and deep greenish hue. The people here turn up their noses at the thought of butter, and nothing angers them more than Spain's new noontime television chef, Karlos Arguinano, who recommends an occasional blend of butter and olive oil for frying.
Promoting this culture of olive oil is one way the Spanish want to boost demand.
"The culture of oil is like that of wine," said Jose Luis Siles, a local building contractor who is president of Jaen's business association. Indeed, Spanish growers have been among the first to offer wide selections of different kinds of oil, not only according to region, but also according to the type of olive tree that bore the fruit, much the way wine growers distinguish between grape varieties like chardonnay or pinot blanc.
In Madrid, a journalism professor-turned-oil promoter named Petra Secanella has begun offering restaurants and gourmet shops selections of dozens of different oil varieties that restaurants can offer to diners much the way they now offer wine lists.
Ms. Secanella has already signed up Spain's Corte Ingles department store chain, and in January she will travel to Berlin for the Grune Woche food show, one of Europe's largest. Her next target will be department stores and restaurants in the United States.
Further down the line, she envisions franchised olive boutiques that will sell not only olive oils, but also related products like olive oil-based candles, miniature decorative bonsai olive trees and pottery lamps that burn olive oil.
In the end, however, the biggest boost to Spanish oils may have come, paradoxically, with the merger last month of two of Spain's biggest oil companies, Koipe S. A., and Elosua S. A., to produce what will be the world's largest olive oil company, with combined annual sales approaching $800 million.
The hitch in all this, of course, and a blow to Spanish ambitions to challenge the Italian hegemony, is that the merger came about only after Koipe, a major producer of food oils based in the northern Basque regions of Spain, was taken over by Eridania Beghin-Say, a unit of the giant Italian food group, Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A., which already held a controlling stake in Elosua.

Holiday Treat: A Turnaround, a Turning On

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
As the season's first snow fell faintly in downtown Flushing last week, holiday lights were turned on for the first time in a decade, red and green strings of lights crisscrossing Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue.
What had been a holiday tradition fell victim to the area's economic downturn in the early 1980's, said Regina Colletta, manager of Community Board 7. Funds could not be raised from the new businesses trying to gain a toehold in an area that was changing economically and ethnically. 
 "The holidays just weren't the same," said Jerry Antonacci of Crown Waste Carting, a family-owned business operating in Flushing for 35 years.
Last month, Mr. Antonacci proposed renewing the tradition. And in what locals say underlines Flushing's tremendous economic growth and the unity among its diverse ethnic groups, businesses responded quickly.
Main Street is being lit between Northern Boulevard and Maple Avenue; Roosevelt Avenue, between Prince and Union Streets. Flushing's business groups had planned to limit the decorations to those two commercial spines, said Ms. Colletta. But hearing of the project, several shops on side-streets said they were willing to pay to have their streets included. So the festivities spread to 40th Road and 39th Avenue, both between Prince and Main Streets.
So far, about $12,000 has been raised from banks, grocery stores and the Korean and Chinese business associations, said Richard Gelman, president of the Flushing Business Association. Next year, he said, the groups hope to illuminate more streets. N.O.

THE ECONOMY
 
The Stock Market Crumbles: Round Up the Usual Suspects
Why, exactly, did stocks unravel Tuesday afternoon, with the Dow industrials losing 91 points, mainly in the last hour? No one really knew. There was the usual doubletalk about "support levels" and "corrections," but the only reasonable explanation seemed to be that investors suddenly grasped the idea that with interest rates rising, they could get better yields in bonds. If so, they were a bit slow on the uptake -- it had been a full week since the Federal Reserve gave its latest shove to rates. There was also talk that weakness in "cyclical" stocks -- the ones that rely on a strong economy -- yanked the wider market down. But a lot of it is probably just trigger-happy traders: no economy is as bumpy as this market. Sure enough, on Wednesday the market steadied, and on Friday the few traders who showed up sent the Dow to a 33-point rebound. 

Capital Gains, Boil and Bubble
Bob Dole certainly got the capital-gains stew bubbling again. Last week he threatened, briefly, to withhold his support for a world trade pact unless President Clinton came around on this much-debated issue. Cutting the gains tax, now 28 percent, is dear to Republican hearts -- it's part of their "Contract With America." But would it be just another tax lollipop for the rich? No, some say: with the rate high, the rich just sit on stale assets, tying up capital that could invigorate new ventures. And after a capital-gains cut, they say, tax revenue would flood into the Treasury. Then again, if politicians just left the tax alone, nobody would wait for the political winds to shift; they'd sell assets when the time seemed right. But of course politicians can't leave things alone -- they'd be out of a job.
 
Tightening Up Medicaid
No one suggests letting the poor go without medical care, but a lot of people are struggling to find a way to cut costs. And preventive care is cheaper than letting someone get really sick and land in a hospital emergency room. On that theory, presumably, New Jersey officials proposed last week to cut Medicaid payments to hospitals by 20 percent. "We cannot be in the business of subsidizing hospitals," a state official said. That makes sense -- but the state has only just begun to arrange preventive-care alternatives. Can hospitals absorb such cutbacks yet?
 
Ending Some Sweet Deals
Who owns mutual savings banks, anyway? More to the point, if they're sold, who should profit? Some insist that depositors own them, and should get any windfall. In reality, bank executives have often cut nice deals for themselves, getting stock and options worth millions during sales -- rewards earned, they say, for their long service. But last week Federal regulators clamped down: no free stock, no options. They did back down on one issue. Outside investors have put money in banks to qualify as depositors when the payoff came, and regulators had considered limiting insider rights to local depositors -- but relented after some investors sued.
 
So, You Finally Came Back
You're probably reading this on Monday or Tuesday, right? The statisticians tell us that if you weren't shopping over the weekend, there's a good chance you were far from home. The travel industry says Americans increasingly use this long weekend (if you worked Friday, you're in a shrinking minority) more for mini-vacations than for family eating derbies nearby. A record 30.4 million Americans were expected to travel at least 100 miles -- a million more than last Thanksgiving. And the airline industry estimated that today (Sunday, that is, for you latecomers), as travelers flood home, planes would be, on average, 80.3 percent full; most of the year, it's around 65 percent.
 
COMPANIES
 
Nothing, Alas, Is Perfect
There's not much left to believe in. Politicians keep disappointing, rumors persist that Santa Claus doesn't exist, and now even the Pentium chip, that pinnacle of high technology, is less than perfect. Even as computers are vilified for running our lives, they are also seen as islands of precision in an imprecise world. But once in a long while, it seems, the Pentium -- which is made by Intel and is in perhaps 10 percent of all personal computers sold -- makes a slight division error. Intel -- which has fixed it and is offering replacements, though not a recall -- insists that a typical user would have just one chance in nine billion of an error. For some, that's too risky. And anyway, did Intel use a Pentium to calculate that risk?
 
Expectations, as in Great
Hand average workers bonuses equal to 8 percent of their salary, and they'd be ecstatic. But Wall Street is different -- especially Goldman, Sachs, one of the richest firms. Its workers are used to sizable year-end stocking-stuffers, in good times and bad. Even in 1987, when the 80's crash-landed, the bonus was 21 percent; last year it hit 30. So it was quite a shock when Goldman said last week that although the firm is in "excellent" condition, earnings are subpar, so the bonus would be just 8 percent. Oh well, if you squint hard, an Escort looks a lot like a Lexus.
 
Shopping: Can It Be Treated?
Today's subject, philosophy class, is free will. Or, more specifically, when retailers shot off that deafening starting gun early Friday morning, did Americans have to tumble headlong for the malls? Did they have any choice, or is it just written somewhere that the day after Thanksgiving must be the year's wildest shopping day, and only the most Scroogelike American would dare skip it? But free will or not, people did start on their monthlong shopping frenzy. And even if the Gingrich stole the Democrats' Christmas, retailers have no expectation that anyone will steal theirs: they predict solid sales, up 5 or 6 percent from last year.
 
Derivatives: Whose Risk?
Derivatives: just say the word and watch corporate treasurers dive for cover. These high-risk toys have led to huge losses at companies that never even realized they'd taken up gambling -- and led to big lawsuits, too. Gibson Greetings, for one, accused Bankers Trust of luring it into risky trades. And last week, in a sure sign that "let the investor beware" does not apply here, a settlement was reached in which Gibson will pay just $6.2 million, or 30 percent, of what Bankers Trust said it was owed. Gibson was "delighted," while Bankers Trust vowed to "defend vigorously" a similar Procter & Gamble suit.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
End of an Era in Japan
It's common knowledge that the Japanese business miracle has been fading, slowly but steadily, for some time. Numbers, whether for stock prices or corporate earnings, abound to chart this. A notable example: Sony's stunning $3.2 billion loss on its Hollywood studios, announced just over a week ago. All that was needed to mark a neat, decisive end of this remarkable era in Japanese history was one vivid symbol, and last week the perfect one appeared: Akio Morita, who co-founded Sony and practically turned it into a lower-case noun meaning electronic goodies, resigned for health reasons. It was no surprise, for Mr. Morita, 73, has been ill for some time and not greatly involved in the company. But his official departure after 22 years as chairman remains a milestone.
 
Berlusconi Under Fire
Yes, America's President has problems -- the elections, Whitewater, Bob Dole. But think of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's Prime Minister. Last week he was told that he faced a corruption inquiry, which is said to involve bribes that his companies may have paid to tax auditors, and another inquiry may focus on antitrust issues linked to his three national television stations. Striking back quickly, Mr. Berlusconi said he was ready to sell part of his business empire if necessary, including control of those television stations. He even threatened to force new elections by resigning. But as a prosecutor said, "We can't stop investigating just because Berlusconi is Prime Minister."
 
Economic Birth Control
Add this to the toll of German unification: eastern Germans have practically stopped having babies -- evidently because in their uncertain new world, they're mired in economic gloom. Or, more to the point, they don't know if they'll have a job. In one demographer's words, Germans "have come as close to a temporary suspension of childbearing as any large population in the human experience." It's a problem common to other formerly Communist countries, but it's worse in Germany, and especially bad in the state of Brandenburg -- births there plunged more than two-thirds in just the last five years. So, alarmed at the thought of a vanishing population, Brandenburg recently announced that it would pay parents $650 whenever they have a child. That would be a help, certainly, but it wouldn't buy you a good job.
 
Watch for Costlier Oil
Once again, OPEC is trying to put a cap on oil production so it can get prices up. After OPEC ministers met last week, they said they'd hold production to 24.5 million barrels for another year, and that could send oil prices up $2 or $3 a barrel -- and send gasoline prices higher too. Of course, if Iraq gets back in the game, that could change the math -- but in that unlikely event, OPEC vows to cut back to balance that.

HEADLINE: Peace and Aid In the Middle East

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In Israel, a Ho-Hum Response to Peace" (World Markets, Oct. 30) was salutary. In questioning a so-called peace dividend, Paul Lewis took a step to correct grave misunderstandings about the peace process, a step that may help temper expectations in other areas. 
 Mr. Lewis, however, did not get to the root of the matter: the peace process itself is unlikely to advance economic reform in Israel. The talks in Casablanca aren't likely to help, either.
Mr. Lewis reports that reform of Israel's socialized economy is a key step to taking "advantage of the new economic opportunities that peace is creating." But changing the "sclerotic socialized economy" represents something far more fundamental than a mere step in Israel's would-be reforms. The economy is socialized and sclerotic because Israel is a socialist regime -- period.
The privatization success that Mr. Lewis cites is inconsequential -- 8 nonbank companies of the 160 Israel owns. Israel has no private sector in the Western sense; socialism based on aid is the highest policy of the Israeli state, for the Likud as well as the Labor Party. This is the heart of the matter.
Looking for the peace dividend in economic reforms turns reality on its head. The purpose of the peace process, in fact, is to make reform unnecessary. The aid that will now flow will go to Jordan and the P.L.O. as well as Israel. This serves Israel's socialist purposes: aid to the Arabs will find its way to Israel via the monopolies and cartels that the peace process is saving from privatization. This is the peace dividend. Of course, Syria is on the agenda; it is the hinge.
Thus the Golan: if Israel can persuade the Americans to send troops to the Golan, (convincing the Israelis will be much easier), the aid spigot will be wide open.
The United States will have become the protector of the peace, while the aid will be necessary to protect the troops. What surer way to guarantee continued Congressional appropriations than to put United States troops at risk if the appropriations stop? What better way to insure the troops remain than to make them responsible for the peace?
The Middle East peace process has arisen because of two factors: the balance-of-power vacuum created by demise of the Soviet Union and the Israeli socialist system's rapacious need for American aid, which is threatened by Soviet breakup. The peace process is supposed to bring about a balance of power by way of the implanting of United States troops on the Golan. In other words, when this unconventional aid-based peace is in place, the assistance will sustain Israel's socialism, making reform unnecessary.

Reader's Mail: Enduring the Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
Question. I own shares in the Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund, which comprises about one-third of my individual retirement account. The fund has an excellent track record; however, with the rise in interest rates and fluctuation in the bond market, I'm getting nervous. I do not plan to become wildly rich with this fund, but neither do I wish to lose principal. Please advise.
Answer. Wellesley Income has performed exceptionally well during the last 10 years because of generally declining interest rates. When rates rise, however, Wellesley's relatively static allocation of 60 percent bonds leaves management with few options to protect investors' capital. 
 Hindsight says the time to bail out was at the end of February, when the fund was off just 1.1 percent for 1994, said Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser based in Buffalo. By mid-November, it was down more than 6 percent, because bonds have been hit harder than stocks so far this year and because Wellesley owns mostly longer-duration bonds, which lose value more rapidly than shorter ones. Also, the fund owns a big chunk of utility stocks, which have not fared well this year.
What to do now? Hang on to your shares, Mr. Ogorek says. "Although rising rates will continue to have a negative impact on Wellesley's share prices, most of the damage may be done," he said. When interest rates begin to fall as the economy heads into the next recession, you may be able to recoup some of your loss as bond prices recover. But "since the economy is still expanding, I don't expect to hear talk of another recession for at least six to nine months," he said.
Q. Because some of us are having difficulties with brokers, would you please consider several related issues: How do brokers obtain the names and addresses, or financial holdings, of potential clients unknown to them? Is there some central clearinghouse that provides this information? Once a client has agreed to buy, is it legal and moral for the broker to demand more personal information? What agencies should abuse of these practices be reported to?
A. Brokers compile all kinds of lists, from magazine subscriptions, building directories, even from the telephone book. "That's an industry in itself," said Dan Jamieson, editor of Registered Representative magazine, a trade publication in Irvine, Calif. When a broker you do not know calls, "there's nothing wrong with asking 'How did you get my name?'," Mr. Jamieson said.
He knows of no clearinghouse of such information or sources of confidential financial data. Again, if you want to know how a person knew something, ask.
Once you agree to buy, the picture changes. Brokers must be sure you meet legal suitability standards -- whether the investment makes sense for you. Without basic financial information about a client, "the broker couldn't make any intelligent recommendations," Mr. Jamieson said.
As for possible abuses of confidentiality, contact the brokerage firm's branch manager, then the company's headquarters, he said. If you feel you have a major legal problem, contact a lawyer or the National Association of Securities Dealers, which has jurisdiction over brokers.
Q. I closely track the performance of my mutual funds and would like to compare them to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with reinvested dividends, from the time I bought shares to the present. However, the daily S.& P. 500 index published in The New York Times and elsewhere is a price-only index that does not take into account reinvested dividends. Do you know where this data is available?
A. While Standard & Poor's sells such information to institutions, there is no similar product aimed at the individual investor, said Martin Skala, senior editor of the Standard & Poor's Outlook, a weekly newsletter for individual investors.
Outlook, however, does publish the dividend yield in each issue. Currently, it is 2.9 percent, meaning that if no companies in the 500 change their dividends over the next 12 months, an owner of the 500 stocks would collect that much in dividends, in addition to any gains or losses in price.
To analyze how well a fund is doing relative to the index, it is better to use more recent figures, perhaps only as far back as three years, than data from a long-ago date of purchase, said Maria Crawford Scott, who edits the American Association of Individual Investors Journal, in Chicago.

HEADLINE: At Work;
A Plan Even Democrats Could Love

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
THINK "harmonic convergence" and what images materialize? Mount Shasta at dawn perhaps. Druids and Californians in saffron robes humming the Windham Hill backlist. Imaginative would be the person who immediately thought, "Ah, employment policy, ah, enlightenment."
Yet scholarship and the Zeitgeist did converge recently in the Republican landslide and the near simultaneous publication of a proposal to overhaul workplace law, leaving two bemused policy experts unexpectedly enjoying a world-historical moment. They are Edward E. Potter and Judith A. Youngman, authors of "Keeping America Competitive: Employment Policy for the 21st Century" (Glenbridge Publishing, $27.95), a compendious excursion through employment law that was surely destined only for the seminar tables of policy Washington until the people spoke on Nov. 8. 
 The book contains a blueprint for a Republican "transformation" -- to adopt the street slang of the new order -- of rules governing the workplace, though entirely without the Sparta-must-die rhetoric of the party's leaders. It seems a genuine attempt to balance the needs of employers who would be internationally competitive and of employees who would be mobile and flexible. Democrats who worry that the next few years would be nothing but bile, big hair and Barry Manilow may be relieved to know that dialogue is possible.
Nothing seems to have surprised the two authors more than the possibility that their book, the summation of several years of experience in the relatively arcane arts of trade policy and employment law, could become someone's legislative agenda.
"This was never intended to be a political book," Mr. Potter said in an interview last week, a few days after the book was presented at a Washington news conference. "It's the coincidence of timing that allows these ideas to have a hearing." Similarly, Dr. Youngman: "We hope to start a discussion and debate, not just of specific proposals but on the fact that employment policy affects the competitiveness of employers and employees." Mr. Potter is a lawyer and president of the Employment Policy Foundation in Washington. Dr. Youngman, an international trade specialist, teaches political science at the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn.
The book argues that Americans have for too long looked abroad for culprits to blame for the decline in the country's competitiveness. However much trade practices, low wages or simple technological piracy may give foreign competitors an edge, the more serious problem is domestic. The country's intricate web of laws and regulations, the authors argue, impose "structural impediments" on the ability of companies and employees to do their jobs efficiently and thus competitively. Contrary to the perceptions of many labor groups, the authors say that regulation is accelerating: In the first 70 years of this century, some 25 laws regulating employment were passed. Between 1970 and 1993, Congress enacted 72 more, including such thickets of complexity as the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
THE premise of much employment law is that there's an inherently adversarial relationship between employers and employees. That partly reflects the labor-versus-capital origin of major protective measures like the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act, both Depression-era responses to employer abuses. But even more recent measures like OSHA, Mr. Potter and Dr. Youngman contend, assume the nastiest about employers' intentions. "They were put in place because of worst-case scenarios, to snuff out the horror stories," Mr. Potter said. "They ensnare companies that would like to be good corporate citizens."
Principally, the authors believe, employment legislation works against workplace flexibility, probably the single most critical component of competitiveness in the evolving global marketplace.
Very high on Mr. Potter's wish list, from among the many suggestions in the book, is revision of parts of the National Labor Relations Act that he and most business lobbying groups believe put the future of the team-employee empowerment movement at risk.
Education, including training and retraining, is the first among equals on Dr. Youngman's list. Not only are young employees turning up without basic verbal and mathematics skills, but the businesses employing them tend to train only enough to do the job, not to transfer their skills elsewhere. "We have to have employees with personal flexibility," Dr. Youngman said. But even tax law undermines flexibility. "I may deduct extra courses that promote my profession," she said. "If I take courses that prepare me for a new occupation, I can't deduct them."
Mr. Potter, who puts education and training high on his list as well, even suggested the crypto-Democratic strategy of offering, as he said, "a small tax credit for providing training above what is required to do the job." The definition of "above what's required" would have to be carefully constructed, he said.
These concerns barely skim the surface of "Keeping America Competitive." Dr. Youngman noted that what became a 434-page book -- and shame on Glenbridge for not paying for an indexer -- began as a 50-page monograph. Many of the issues, she said, are politically sensitive and subject to conflict."It's easy to avoid them." But, as all sides might agree by now, the country's economic future is more imperiled by denial than by debate.

HEADLINE: Diary Of an Urban Priest

 BODY:
"NEW YORK CITY, are you kidding?" the newly ordained John Flynn thought in 1958 as he contemplated his assignment to St. Raymond's parish in the Parkchester section of the Bronx. The son of a freight company executive, raised in Westchester and upstate New York, he knew little of the city except its air of danger. "I knew the grass," he says. "I knew mountains. I knew fields." A few years later, he took a confession at St. Raymond's: "Someone said he committed a sin: walking on the grass. I wondered, how could it be a sin to walk on grass?"
Now at age 65, having spent his career ministering to the city folk, he sits in the rectory of St. Martin du Tours on Grote Street in the central Bronx, the bright-eyed soul of youth not completely extinguished but alternating with the burden of the years. There is no summing him up: He is a man whose spirit can at one moment leap joyously at the faith of the three women who bothered to attend Friday Mass, and at the next wonder helplessly at a drug operation across the street that delivers the ultimate insult: retailing a brand of crack, St. Martin Green Cap, named after his church. 
 He has been on intimate terms with the Bronx for three and a half decades, having nursed its psychic wounds and witnessed its tumultuous arc of recent history firsthand: stability, abandonment and, now, what is billed as a revival. At St. Raymond's, he tried, not always successfully, to prepare the Irish and Italian working class for the inevitable coming of the black and Hispanic population. At St. Francis Assisi in University Heights, he watched the Sherman's march of arson lay waste to entire blocks and maneuvered to place homeless parishioners in neighborhoods to the north. Since 1989, he has served dead center in the Bronx, in a largely Hispanic parish in East Tremont, just to the west of the Bronx Zoo.
This most recent neighborhood is an area that, if viewed through the windshield of a touring car, would seem to be getting a fair shake for its poor and working poor these days. New ball fields have been built, and the signature of government funds and the sweat of nonprofit organizations are seen in housing rehabilitation and rows of new suburban-style development.
Father Flynn's antennae, though, are tuned to a deeper frequency, one where the human spirit decides whether or not to buckle under the sheer weight of life. And though he glories visibly in the heroics of those parishioners who keep their worlds together through hardship and turmoil, he senses a deeper crisis that sets this time apart from earlier times in the Bronx -- an atrophying of ambition and hope, especially among the young. It is an issue that both troubles him and engages his curiosity, as evidenced by the innocent and persistent questioning of the young people who flit across his path on his walks through his neighborhood. "Why not try?" he asks them. "Why not try?"
As for why they don't, Father Flynn can only suggest: Guns and AIDS have had an impact on the fabric of life far beyond statistics of the dead. They have created, for the living, a critical mass of conflict and suffering that preoccupies the mind, creates a weariness and weighs down ambition.
"Poverty is not as deep," he says, tracing that arc of his experience. "But the spiritual poverty is worse. You see it in the young people. There is a depression that I have never felt before. The adults are good at covering it up. But the kids are symptomatic of what's going on in the houses. There is a deep depression."
For a glimpse of Father Flynn's work and his world, The City asked him to keep a diary. This edited and abbreviated version follows him from Sept. 8 to Oct. 8, as he struggled along with others to get an education-and-jobs program, Save a Generation, off the ground, and as he made his age-old priestly rounds -- saying Mass, visiting the sick, worrying about the parish finances.
 
Thursday, Sept. 8
A good day.
It is the second day for our parish elementary school. It's good to see the kids, parents and teachers again. They all look good from vacation.
It is also the culmination of two years' hard work -- orientation day for our Save a Generation program. Twenty-two of the 25 young people who have been upstate, training National Guard-style and studying for their G.E.D.'s, came today. They have graduated from the five-month Challenge program. Now they are beginning their year in Save a Generation, working in Bronx parks, doing more college-preparation study at night and continuing to develop life skills through a healthy belonging in our group.
They were troubled youth; out of school, out of work, hanging out, going nowhere. All our work -- getting the funding, the cooperation of the various agencies -- was worth it. It is wonderful to see the changes in the youth, to see them energetically take the next big step on the way to very positive lives.
It was a little sad to run into two youths who had dropped out. Still smoking marijuana. Hanging out. They pooh-poohed the success of the others. Sour grapes. That is the demon working over the kids when they are with their old friends. They try to pull them back down.
About 9 P.M., I went on my walk through the neighborhood. I ran into a crack addict whose son died tragically when he fell between subway cars -- at 13 years of age. She asked me to pray for her son. She told how awful crack was and said it is a disgrace it is sold so close to a church. There have to be 200 visits a day to the drug spot.
I talked to her about stopping her habit, but it doesn't look hopeful. She gives the impression that she can't find meaning in her life since her son died.
 
Friday, Sept. 9
I visited in Jacobi Hospital with one who has become my friend. He is in his early 20's. He is foot-cuffed to the bed, under arrest. I met him a while back. He was on a roof, with his baby in his arms, threatening to commit suicide. An officer talked with him and I hugged his mother, telling him, "Your mother is trembling; she is trembling." He decided against death. Still, there were problems: His 16-year-old girlfriend and her family didn't want him to see his baby. Two months ago, he went on a rampage and had an encounter with a police officer and then put a gun to his own head and shot himself.
Now he is blind. We have spent many hours together. His perception -- if you will, his vision of the meaning of his life -- has improved greatly.
Today we had a party with the Save a Generation youths and all the founders and supporters of the program. My heart was full as I heard the youth give testimony of where they are in their life journey and life struggle. They spoke from their hearts about their pride, their fears and their dreams. They are going to make it, by God. God is good, and this is God's work.
On my night walk I talked to some guys about the hopeless baseball situation, then stopped by some Jamaicans and heard, from their car radio, "The Lord is my Shepherd" in Jamaican rap. Some of it sounded real good. Maybe we have to incorporate some of that into our liturgy.
 
Saturday, Sept. 10
Today we had what might be the last great Italian wedding in St. Martin's. It was classy, complete with horse and buggy. Several hundred people came. We don't have many Italian families left. It's nice to have something for them. It gives a nice taste of what it was like in the past.
 
Sunday, Sept. 11
I had the 11 A.M. Spanish Mass. My talk was about the suffering that comes with life: Love includes suffering, but nonlove (not facing love's responsibility) also includes suffering. The choice you must make is which suffering to avoid: the suffering that love demands and that brings peace, or the suffering that comes from emptiness and feelings of nonfulfillment.
During Mass, it's always painful for me to watch the steady flow of addicts across the street. I think of the contrast -- on one side, a flood of people hungry for Christ; on the other, people addicted to crack. I am pained because I have lost contact with most of the young people who are the drug sellers. I used to talk to some of them, and they seemed to be interested, at least in the attention I gave. Now we've grown apart.
 
Monday, Sept. 12
Golf day. Day off. I played a lousy round in Garrison, N.Y. -- 98. One small consolation: my player friends were worse.
Though his golf game hovers frustratingly in the upper 80's or low 90's (he has shot in the upper 70's five times), golf day is a balm for Father Flynn, one of the things that keeps him going. An enthusiastic athlete, he also skiis and plays hockey. ("I am not violent," he says of his hockey game. "But I'm not not violent.")
He calls his priest friends "old-timers." When they get together for golf or cards, there is a lot of remembering, often about vacations taken together -- 100-mile canoe trips, explorations in Kenya and Alaska. They also talk about cars and sports (Father Flynn notes the Giants' "spiritual flatness" this season), share advice on parish problems and exchange clerical gossip, like who's talking to the Cardinal now?
 
Tuesday, Sept. 13
Visited five people in the hospitals -- three in Montefiore, one in Our Lady of Mercy and my blind friend in Jacobi. The doctor told him he would never see again. He is living with that but fears having to go to jail in his condition. I hope he is allowed to go home on probation or parole.
In the evening Mass, I gave First Communion to a man of 30 years. He was as thrilled as a kid. Moments like this give me great consolation.
I went out on my usual Tuesday night walk, and I was asked about a young boy who was pursued yesterday by a crowd armed with metal bats. They caught up to him near a construction site. They say he was badly beaten and that no one helped, not even the construction workers. It was rumored that he was beaten to death. I heard, though, that he may have lived.
To find out more, I walked to the site of the beating. Then I heard three or four rapid-fire shots back in the area I had just left. When I walked back around, there was no activity, so I guess no one got hit.
 
Wednesday, Sept. 14
I visited an H.I.V.-positive young man. He had been very sick over the weekend, but he was better today. He is separated from his wife and child. How hard is the sickness. He explained that as friends began to suspect his illness, he lost them as friends.
Today in East Tremont, the priestly duty of visiting the sick often means comforting those dying of AIDS. The AIDS cycle has familiar complications. The partners of the victim become enraged that they may have become exposed. Without emotional support, the victim is isolated and angry. "You're 35 and all you have ahead of you is a slow, painful death," Father Flynn says. "They take it out on the nurses. If there is no spirituality, all that is left is anger. There is no purpose to the death. It's not like you're dying for your kid."
 
Thursday, Sept. 15
I got the announcements ready for the Sunday parish bulletin. A possible funding agency came to see me and Jon Dwyer, the director of Save a Generation. We need $100,000 to keep the program going for the rest of the year.
In the evening I went out to a neighborhood softball game. I was told that the young man in the bat beating had died. Tomorrow I will go to the 48th Precinct to find out the true story. If it was a killing, we will go to the spot to pray, as we do whenever someone is murdered. We go to consecrate the spot that has been desecrated by violence. We pray our neighborhood will stabilize. This incident will cause more families to move for their kids' sake. We have lost a lot of church families. Many have left for Florida.
The parish is filled with graffiti memorials to the murdered. Since he came to St. Martin's in 1989, Father Flynn says, he has counted 37 people murdered in the neighborhood immediately around the church. This, he says, has been "a good year" -- he counts only four killings -- but even with the drop, he sees no corresponding decline in fear. He speculates that only several years of improvement would bring some psychic relief, begin to alter the understanding of where power lies in the neighborhood and signal that society has the ability to control the criminal world.
 
Friday, Sept. 16
Today is Ring Day for the seniors of Aquinas High School. It is a blast. The feeling was wonderful, full of emotions from cheers to tears. It is wonderful to feel the power of their celebration.
The staff has been completing arrangements for the Save a Generation youths to start work in the woods of Van Cortlandt Park.
At the precinct, I learned that the young man in the bat attack hadn't died and will probably recuperate, although he is badly hurt. I still don't know why it happened.
I met a lady on my night walk. She told me to move out of the area I was in because it was dangerous.
I met a nicely dressed young lady waiting to be taken to a dance by her boyfriend on her birthday. They felt real good about going there. It is nice to see youth celebrate life and do so safely.
I ran into a little discomfort on tonight's walk. Usually, I am very well received as I walk, usually alone, and talk to everybody. I always wear the Roman collar with a cross around my neck. I began wearing the cross when I started a campaign four years ago to trade a cross for a gun. As yet, I haven't had any takers, but I hope the symbolism is understood. One young man asked me what the cross cost. "Eight dollars," I said. He said I must be crazy to think someone would trade a gun worth $100 or more for a cross worth $8. The symbolism wasn't understood there.
Anyway, tonight I said hello to a teen-age girl, and she seemed upset that I had spoken to her. Later, on my way home, I stopped by a stoop to say "Hello" or "What's up" to a number of teens. The same girl was there. The girl said loudly, "There's that man again trying to make conversation with me." Again a sign of the problems in the city -- especially for young girls. I'll be more careful.
The walk is a showing of the flag of moral strength. Father Flynn moves through the streets shaking hands with winos, greeting domino players. He says the walk brings dignity to the people, a reminder that they can rise above misery. "They think small of themselves," he says. "You can see it in how they curse so much." He says he fears physical harm less than rejection.
 
Saturday, Sept. 17
A drama continues in Our Lady of Mercy. Ramon Lopez, a very holy man, has been in a long coma. There doesn't seem to be a lot of hope that he will survive. Still, his wife and 14 children have a lot of hope that God will care for him.
Don Ramon is a simple man. He is from the hills of the Dominican Republic. He learned to read and became the delegate of the Word. He was a minister of Communion and gave lessons in catechism. He became a town leader and built, with his hands, a church out of wood and leaves from the cornfields. He ran the church for 18 years as he worked the farms. He came to the United States a year or so ago. In Spanish culture, the term "Don" is reserved only for the most revered.
Tomorrow I promised to visit a dying young man in Jacobi and to explain to his mother that, since he has been declared brain dead by the doctors, it would be just as well if no extraordinary means would be used. Just as he has a right to live, in these circumstances he also has a right to die if nature takes him there.
 
Sunday, Sept. 18
It is a nice Sunday. It's my favorite day of the week. The whole family of the parish comes together. There were about 850 worshippers at the three Masses. The day is filled with happiness, exchanges of greetings and smiles -- some confidences -- and then the faith and joy expressions in the liturgy, the singing. I have my little appointment book ready and I make most of my week's appointments. Church is a place for the folks to get away from the meanness and cursing in the streets.
I went to see a woman whose grandson was shot and is in intensive care at Jacobi. She is a beautiful person but overburdened. She is raising the badly wounded boy and his two teen-age brothers, who were also shot at. Another group of boys had come looking for another boy with whom they had a "beef." They shot at the brothers because they figured they were friends of that boy. The grandmother is trying to raise the boys because their mother died. She is also raising a lot of other baby grandchildren in the apartment. She admitted that it was too much for her, but she will continue. The words of counsel she gave her grandson revealed that she is a women of great peace. But she said it is hard to raise youth in New York -- too many negative influences try to pull them away to a bad path.
I stopped to see my young blind friend in Jacobi. His court stuff is not settled, but he was in good spirits. His mother and father were there. Their love is saving him from despair. It is a great blessing from God, whom he believes in, that he has such an optimistic attitude. Even when he was taking his life, he believed it would be all right because, he said: "My soul is not mine, it is God's. So no matter what, it goes back to God."
 
Monday, Sept. 19
Beautiful golf day. Went to a course in Millbrook, N.Y., with three priest friends. Beautiful day, but I played awful golf. Around 100.
 
Tuesday, Sept. 20
I met with Sister Cecilia, principal of our parochial school for the past 25 years. She is a great old-time principal. But students today are more disrespectful to her than they would have been even five years ago. She reassured me, though, that it should be a good year.
I saw a boy on the street sitting by himself during school hours; he was about 13. I asked him, "No school?" and he said, "I didn't went today," proving the need.
Save a Generation is on its third workday in Van Cortlandt Park deep in the woods. The crew chiefs say the youths are enthusiastic and working hard.
On my night walk, I met a man near the church sitting on a wall. He said he wasn't using drugs but that his girlfriend was. He told me he was going to go to detox and hoped to go away for a permanent cure. We talked about how some use detox just to feel better so they can start again with drugs. He said others go into detox because they are broke and then get out when their check comes.
He talked about violence he had seen that I hadn't known about: a man beaten last winter and left for dead to freeze. He said that if you don't buy drugs at one particular spot, they beat you and take what little money you have. He said how awful it is out there. I wished him well. Then a little prayer.
Around 10:15 P.M., I passed Thorpe House, Crotona and 183d, a home for homeless women and children, and the woman in charge of security told me about a man who was drinking and crying a lot. She felt bad that she couldn't help, so she sent me after him. He was staggering down the street.
The man looked like he was in his late 40's. He was drinking a beer and crying in sobs while he talked. He told me that he had been away to jail a number of times. He said I should go home with him to see his poor wife. His constant refrain was, "I need a job, I can't get a job -- there is no job." When I suggested that drink might be as much a problem, he did not turn hostile but held me and said, "No, I need a job."
I agreed to see his wife, but I had some misgivings. I think I went more to see he got home. When we got there, his wife said in Spanish: "There he is again in this condition. If he doesn't stop this, he will lose everything." I mentioned the job thing. He stayed quiet. She said in English now, "He says it's about a job, but he's an alcoholic." I made an offer for him to come see me when he is sober, and I left for home, relieved it was over for now. You never know what's going to happen in a situation like that. Just a hard scene.
 
Wednesday, Sept. 21
A very good parishioner came with a mother who wants to baptize a number of her children. This mother has been off of drugs for a month. And one of the reasons she has been making it is the beautiful parishioner, who has been guiding her as a guardian angel. People are great -- right! People have a lot of problems, too. I'm trying to get her to go to a support group for further strength.
I stopped by some young men on the corner. One boy asked me to bless his nephew. There were five youths, two in school, three neither working nor in school. The police went by. One boy said the whole precinct is corrupt. Another boy said he says that because he sells drugs. They all laughed. The first boy said the police search them and keep the money and that they beat them. To me, the police around here are good. But that kind of talk causes a perception of violence and dishonesty.
Father Flynn's relations with the police are polite but not close. This is a matter of priestly realpolitik. Being perceived as too close to the police would hurt his credibility on the street. People wouldn't tell him things.
 
Thursday, Sept. 22
The evening was for Save a Generation. A tough night. We did an analysis of power -- political economic, personal, etc. -- and how to use it and how it can be abused. There was a sufficient attitude of resistance to concern me. A griping session broke out about the work conditions, and the session ended on a negative note. I should have been able to control the expressions of feelings better.
I visited Ramon Lopez, the very holy man, and a large part of his family was still praying for him in the floor's waiting room. They have great faith, but whatever God wants.
 
Friday, Sept. 23
A tough sleep night. It's like being in the belly of the beast -- the suicide of a man with a young family and the basically negative meeting with the Save a Generation members. The program is demanding. There will be a lot of struggle before we see success.
The 9 A.M. Mass helped. Only three wonderfully devoted Hispanic ladies were present. The message was about how life is a mysterious mix of pain and joy. But the suffering love of Christ and the Resurrection is the strength to live the mystery. Their prayers were so filled with faith that it picked me up.
I talked to a lady from my former parish. After discussing a number of family problems, including a daughter, unmarried with two children, and a son with a psychiatric problem, she asked me for a letter of recommendation to move because the house she lives in has a devil. There have been a number of killings in or around it. I wrote the letter.
The evening walk was nice, even in the drizzle. I got to bless a bodega and its new owner. I met the security guard who had sent me to the crying drunk man the other night. As I said good night, she said, "It's good to have you in the neighborhood, Father." That felt real good.
Asked how he copes personally with the daily litany of grief, Father Flynn says, "I don't." But then he quickly adds that the rewards of helping people are enormous. "You can't despair," he says. "You can't let it weigh you down. It creeps into things you say. Into your sermons. Into the stories you tell. It gets everyone down. You can't drag people down. You can't forget the celebration."
 
Saturday, Sept. 24
I had another restless night. Especially worried about Save a Generation, which is going to be harder to make successful than I ever foresaw. I have been greatly reliant on prayer the last three nights. Sometimes all you can do is lay it on God and try to stop thinking.
I brought Communion to someone in the projects, 19th floor. Hate to ride the elevators in the projects. As I rode up I thought about the last time there. I had decided to walk down against the recommendation of others. When I got down I was told someone had been bat beaten and robbed a few days earlier. Today I was thinking, I still prefer walking. The 19th floor, the door opened -- that is, one opened. The door to the hall stayed shut. Panic began to hit -- I'm stuck. Keep your wits. I pushed 20 and the elevator climbed and opened on 20. I walked down again, noticing all the dirty messages written on the walls.
 
Sunday, Sept. 25
Again, my favorite day. Outside before the first Mass, I got into a fun conversation with a former graduate of our grammar school. He made freshman football at Fordham Prep, so he gave me a blow-by-blow description of a game, emphasizing especially what he did. Across the street, the crack action was as usual.
 
Monday, Sept. 26
Golf day. It's hard, but I really tried to get work out of my mind. As usual I hit the ball hard and far, and somewhat out of control. I think it is a little bit like I live. I am impulsive and not ordered. I go by interest, by inspiration.
 
Tuesday, Sept. 27
I had the seventh grade in St. Martin's. The discussion was about personal power -- education, money power, social power, force power. Drugs and drug lords always come up. They have power in the neighborhood. If the kids see me talking to a drug dealer, it increases my image for some.
Late afternoon: $5,000 came for Save a Generation from Jesuits. What a relief. This evening we had a meeting of the parish finance committee, basically about how to get a little more money. We really do a lot with a little -- but we need to do more.
There was a wake for a man from Argentina whose daughter had brought him near her to die. As almost always, there was a lot of faith shown. In some ways, I think that our best faith and love are shown at the time of death. It's beautiful, but it is sort of a death-centered culture -- maybe because we have so many who die in violence, because of the youthful victims.
On my night walk, a young man asked me for a rosary. I told him to come to church Sunday and I'd give him one. Most youths like to wear the rosary around the neck. Even in giving rosaries, we have to be a little wary to make sure people aren't looking for beads in their gang's colors.
The finance committee is taking on a more important role these days. Just as there are calls everywhere for "reinventing government," a parallel struggle is taking place in the city's parishes. The traditional method of income-sharing among parishes is helping less as the better-off parishes find themselves increasingly strapped. At St. Martin's, Father Flynn recently introduced tithing, which has generated $500 more in collections a week. And with the Archdiocese of New York reducing support for the parish school, there is talk of raising tuition, which now ranges from $130 to $160 a month, and of a possible merger of grades within the school, meaning bigger classes.
 
Wednesday, Sept. 28
In the evening, 43 people came to the first Spanish-language class in preparation for a more active part in the parish ministry. There was great enthusiasm and participation. I'm thrilled. Next class: next week.
 
Thursday, Sept. 29
I visited Don Ramon in the hospital. His condition is worse. The doctors and staff are working to prepare the family for his death. The family loves him so much, but it will conform to the will of God.
I had some time with the Save a Generation youth. Only seven came to class when I was there. That is discouraging. But there was a good, positive discussion about how to realize their goals. Things are better because a good teacher started.
There was a teaching moment with the Save a Generation youths, and I'm not sure how it was used. One youth had a confrontation with a policeman. He had dropped a container on the ground. The policeman told him to pick it up. The struggle for respect and authority started there. The boy resisted picking it up. It got bad enough for the policeman to drag him by the shirt and pull him into his face -- to threaten him with arrest. With a lot of muttering, swaggering and attitude, trying to save face and yet not get arrested, the boy picked up the container.
I said, "You did good." He kind of got angry at me for saying that, because he felt like he lost. I asked him how would he have reacted five months ago, before the Challenge program. He said he would have been more violent. I said he was growing more mature. He was still fuming.
In the evening, I went to the 125th anniversary of St. Jerome's parish. It was beautiful, the Mass and the mix of white old-timers and black and Hispanic present parishioners.
 
Sunday, Oct. 2
I picked up five senior citizens for Mass at 9 o'clock. They love to play and laugh on the trip to the church. There were large crowds for the three masses, about 900 people. It's always a curious spectacle -- the Mass. There is the proclamation of the Word up front and the Sacred Mysteries, and there are the teen-agers in the corners whispering to each other from time to time. Their participation is different from the adults. Then there are the little children walking around under their mothers' gaze, going over to each other and playing to the adult audience, most of whom love distraction.
The police seem to be watching the crack house this morning, interfering with business.
I met two teen-age girls from our religious education program for public school students. They are delightful; they are always looking for altar boys. They believe they will have better access when they become altar girls.
 
Tuesday, Oct. 4
Feast of St. Francis of Assisi. He is one of my favorites -- close to God, his people and nature. Sort of a natural supernatural man.
The 9 o'clock funeral was for a 32-year-old who died of AIDS. He must have been down on his luck because only a dozen people came -- whereas young people usually have a lot more at their funerals.
In my evening walk, a few teen-age boys told me they hadn't been baptized or received Communion or Confirmation. I made appointments for them. There is spiritual hunger out there. Even the young know something is missing in their lives.
 
Wednesday, Oct. 5
A young man explained why his parents couldn't attend a ministry preparation class. On the bus the day before, his pregnant sister sat on a girl's coat. Harsh words were spoken to her. She said she didn't want trouble because she was pregnant. The offended girl and friends said they didn't care, that she should watch her back. Today, she was attacked by the girls and they had a knife. She was punched in the stomach but escaped. She was taken to Jacobi and released. The baby is still alive. I say thank God for the blessing, and God help us with the viciousness that is in people.
 
Thursday, Oct. 6
At 3:30 there turned out to be a ridiculous court appointment in Jacobi for my blind prisoner friend. The judge came. His lawyer came, a court recorder came, as did an assistant district attorney. But nothing could be done because fingerprints had not been taken in the case. So court was adjourned, $5,000 bail set and my man stays in the hospital.
At 8 P.M., Joe Towle, who is a Jesuit and a friend of mine, and I talked to about 35 Jesuit students near Fordham. Our presentations were well received; the participation was lively. It's great to see that us old men priests have some (not many) replacements coming up to take our places. They have dreams so glorious. World beaters! It's nice to see there's something left of what we have been.
Father Flynn knows, though, that there is not much left. "It used to be a sociologically great thing to become a priest -- adulation, support," he says. "It's a different time. Hispanic people are not supplying the priests."
As for solutions, he acknowledges differences, tensions, with the church hierarchy. "They need to understand the different forms of ministry -- women, for example," he says. "They have to understand that parishes may not have to be run by the priest. Maybe the deacons have to run parishes. There is a resistance to do different things. But it can't be business as usual."
Still, he remains a staunch defender of the church: "We're here and we never left. Folks moved away. Companies moved away. We're supporting schools other people would have closed. We never walked away."
 
Friday, Oct. 7
The afternoon is tough. A young woman, a drug addict, came in. At the same time I was desperately trying to get the man finishing detox into a therapeutic community. And a water pipe broke in the bathroom where two men were installing a flusher in the toilet. The tube eventually got fixed. I was less successful with the two drug cases -- but some progress was made.
The entire Save a Generation family had a session on "feelings" in the rectory. A lot of it was getting out negative feelings that people had about each other. I got mine out, too. One youth said that the youths didn't always understand me when I spoke. I am a little disturbed that there are so many negative feelings, and they sense that. I guess I should notice better how hard they are working and not fall into negativity.
I took a short walk at night. I met Willie. He had quit or been asked to leave Challenge. He said he was going back. Good news.
 
Saturday, Oct. 8
I called Carmen, who has been heroically living with cancer. As often happens when I call or visit, I become strengthened by her great attitude. All that chemotherapy, all those operations, all that pain, all that weakness -- and to still be strong in love and faith. I wonder how I would be.
I went to the Columbus Day Parade -- from Tremont, up Crotona, across Crescent, to Arthur Avenue. The parade was as much Hispanic and black as it was Italian. In a lot of ways that is good, because it is inclusive. It wasn't always so around here.
In the evening I responded to a call to go visit and pray over Marie, who is dying of cancer at home and whose husband, Ray, is devastated. Really he is wearing himself out. He really needs to consider getting Marie into Calvary, where patients are treated with the greatest dignity. He chose this night to tell her that she has cancer. He needed our prayers and presence to support him in the hardest test of his life. I was nearby when he told her. She said something like she never thought it was that. But to me she didn't seem to feel much impact from such serious news about herself. She is weak and maybe beyond certain awareness.
There were three of us visiting; Ray got a lot of support. He will apply to Calvary.
 
Afterword
 In the weeks since, life and work have continued.
* There appears to be progress in Save a Generation. The program lost 2 of the 22 members, and a few more are expected to quit soon. But Father Flynn says the central core is maturing. "They're seeing we're serious and that this is not just a boondoggle where you get paid to show up," he says. "We are fighting to establish who is in control. It's hard but it's working." Still, the program needs $100,000 to complement government funds and get through next summer. And though a foundation has offered a $50,000 matching grant, Father Flynn says, "We've got a lot of work to do."
* At the crack house across the street, the police presence has increased, and things are better.
* The blind man is home under house arrest, wearing an ankle bracelet that monitors his movements. His spirits are good. "He seems optimistic," Father Flynn says. "I plan to get him baptized."
* Don Ramon died on November 16. Father Flynn went to the hospital, where he consoled each relative; afterward, they all went to the chapel and prayed. The funeral Mass was packed. One of Don Ramon's sons spoke to thank everyone for caring so much about his father. Then, Father Flynn says, "They sent him back to the Dominican Republic, where he did his great work."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BAY RIDGE;
Merchants Plan Gesture to Bridge the Gap With New Jersey

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Fed up with what they say is a growing exodus of consumer dollars out of their neighborhood and across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into New Jersey, more than two dozen merchants in Bay Ridge are planning to stage a protest against New York State's sales tax.
The merchants, mostly on the commercial strips of Third and Fifth Avenues, have agreed to discount their prices by 8.25 percent, the same percentage as the state sales tax, for a single day. 
 The protest, to be called Tax Relief Day, will give customers a good reason not to go to New Jersey, they hope, where there is no sales tax on clothes or shoes.
But the primary point, they say, is to send a message to city and state politicians.
"Even if our stores are not thronged because of this, even if it's just a gesture, I think that if the politicians see that we're willing to do this, maybe they'll sit up and listen," said Catherine Papayiannis, a vice president of community banking at Olympian Bank in Bay Ridge and an organizer of the tax protest.
Mayor Giuliani proposed in his budget that the city forego its 4 percent share of the sales tax so the rate would be 4.5 percent. But a bill to codify the change, introduced by State Senator Roy Goodman during the Legislature's last session, failed to pass.
The Mayor's office said the tax decrease, which would start in the middle of the 1996 fiscal year, would save New Yorkers $98 million in 1996 and $195 million in fiscal 1997.
John Logue, a Third Avenue ice cream shop owner who helped organize the Voice of Bay Ridge Business to promote smaller businesses, said the idea for the 8.5 percent discount came from Staten Island, where a similar organization staged a tax-relief day on Friday with about 60 merchants. Shoppers at some participating stores there said they enjoyed the savings, but merchants said it was be difficult to determine if the discount had increased sales.
Originally, the Bay Ridge merchants planned their event for the same day, but they could not complete preparations in time, including having promotional signs printed.
"People just sat on it too long," said Patricia Thristino, the president of four Jenny Lynn clothing stores that have been on Third Avenue for 13 years. "By the time we got everybody together, it was too late."
Ms. Thristino said the delay would not lessen the impact of the plan. "Everybody's really excited about this," she said. "Today would have been a great week to start, but it's just a matter of time. Next week, people will be even more interested and excited about the holiday season."
Mr. Logue said many merchants in Bay Ridge began noticing a significant drop in their holiday business when the recession began in the early 1990's. "Everybody was pinching every penny, who could blame them?" he said. "But now we have to fight, to do something to bring them back."
Ms. Thristino said New Jersey's competitive edge was most painful at this time of year. "What we tend to see, especially around the holiday season, is that customers will come in and buy a shirt or two," she said. "But they tell us 'Hey, for my big Christmas shops, I'm going to Jersey. No sales tax." R.K.

The Legality of a Honk
 
Q. Automobile horn blowing seems unnecessary in a city. I believe it is prohibited in Paris, for example. Is it against the law here?
A. Now, don't panic. But right now, all over the city, thousands of New York City residents are flouting the authority of Section 24-221a of the city's Noise Control Code: "No person shall operate or use or cause to be operated any claxon installed on a motor a vehicle except as a sound signal of imminent danger."
While losing your job for being late or suffering a nervous breakdown in midday traffic may fit many people's idea of "imminent danger," technically it still doesn't justify using your car horn.
But, luckily for cacophonous car owners, the city does not pursue offenders rigorously; generally, the Environmental Control Board levies fewer than 10 fines a year for car horn violations.
To register complaints about noise pollution, call the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's 24-hour complaint line, (718) DEP-HELP.
 
Sheriff Fetches Fines
 
Q. I saw a white car marked Sheriff holding up traffic in Central Park. Who is the New York City Sheriff, and what does he do?
A. Despite its folksy moniker and long history, the New York City Sheriff has more to do with tow trucks than with gunfights. Established in 1626, the Sheriff's office in Manhattan and its equivalents in the other boroughs served as a major part of the patchwork of law-enforcement agencies that existed before the city's consolidation in 1898.
After that, the new New York City Police Department took over the responsibility for criminal investigations and arrests. As recently as 1942, the Sheriff was also responsible for manning and administering the city's jails, a duty now carried by the Department of Correction.
Today, the sheriff's primary duties are enforcing court-ordered judgments and fines, including unpaid parking tickets and littering fines, and collecting judgments from reluctant losers in private lawsuits, said John George, the Sheriff's executive assistant.
Sheriff's deputies, outfitted in dark blue uniforms and state-trooper style Stetsons, carry guns and can make arrests if they see a crime in action.
In recent years, the Sheriff's office, though small in comparison to the City Police Department, has been no stranger to attention. The previous Sheriff, Philip A. Crimaldi, found himself in hot water with the City Council and city marshals (who also collect fees for the city) for his tough tactics with parking-ticket scofflaws, which included seizing their cars.
Some residents also accused Mr. Crimaldi's deputies of using tactics reminiscent of the Old West, including brandishing weapons to collect unpaid fines. Mr. Crimaldi denied his deputies acted improperly.
But now there's a new Sheriff in town. Kerry John Katsorhis, a Queens lawyer, was appointed on June 2 by Mayor Giuliani as the 108th Sheriff of New York City.
And as for weapons, Mr. Katsorhis said shortly after his appointment that, frankly, he doesn't like guns. But does he wear a star?
 
More Lawyers, by Far
 
Q. My friend and I (he a litigious drone, I an artist) got into an argument that you might be able to settle. Are there more lawyers or more actors in New York City?
A. The drones have it. As of Sept. 1, the State Office of Court Adminstration shows 63,823 registered lawyers doing business in New York City. By comparison, actors seem practically scarce.
According to Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Actors Equity, the professional actors and stage managers union, there are about 16,000 professional actors registered with Equity in the New York City area. This figure does not, however, include legions of nonunion actors or actors working only in film or television.
Though more lawyers means more competition, they can take solace in the fact that they're at least registered as "doing business"; the average weekly unemployment rate for Equity actors runs at about 83 percent. JESSE McKINLEY

HEADLINE: The Nation -- Alamo? What Alamo?;
Texans Want to Get Closer to Mexico

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
SOME 158 years ago, Texas firmly declared its independence from Mexico, and its citizens adopted an equally firm sense of self. Whatever they were, they were not Mexican. The image of a tall Texas Ranger, his six-shooters still smoking, standing over a stack of limp but conclusively disciplined Mexicans who were inevitably identified as banditos, made Texans feel that all was right with the world.
 But now, Texas looks at Mexico and wants back in. So badly that classes are springing up around the state, sponsored by community colleges, chambers of commerce and government agencies, to help Texans turn themselves into Mexicans. 
 "Don't keep your emotions close to the vest," an instructor on videotape recently implored a classroom full of small-business people in Dallas. "Cultivate drama in your style. Use your hands, facial gestures, vocal inflections. Avoid being too cool, distant, rational. What's a professional attitude in the U.S. seems distant there."
 Those storming a counter outside, who hadn't booked early enough to get in, seemed to need no instruction in drama, although the class is offered monthly.
 
Export Central
 The North American Free Trade Agreement, effective Jan. 1, has merely accelerated trends started when Mexico began opening its markets in the 1980's. Nearly half the nation's exports to Mexico, now running at $50 billion a year, come from this state, and more than three-quarters at least pass through Texas. In 1990, Texas had 4.3 million Hispanic residents, more than 25 percent of the population and more than twice as many as it had in 1970.
 Although tougher border enforcement in places like El Paso has brought cheers, nothing like California's Proposition 187, restricting health and welfare benefits for illegal aliens, has made any headway here. In a Democratic runoff this year, a previously favored Senate candidate who suggested calling out the military to halt illegal immigrants lost even El Paso County.
 Traditional Texas history -- as dispensed, for example, by a tour guide from the Daughters of the Republic of Texas at the Alamo in San Antonio, favors the Anglos: "These Alamo defenders were 189 patriots who valued freedom more than life itself," she said, her voice shaking with emotion over their deaths at Mexican hands.
 
The First Illegals
 But some Texans are rewriting their own history, adopting the Mexican position that the Anglos actually valued mercenary pay, criminal misadventure and the chance to grab some Mexican land. "Some say these were Texas's first illegal aliens," said Cynthia Orozco, who has taught a revised version of Texas history at the University of Texas at San Antonio.
 Several San Antonio politicians and state lawmakers favor kicking out the Daughters, who have preserved the Alamo as a military shrine, and restoring it to highlight its origins as a Franciscan mission founded by Spaniards from Mexico in 1718.
 For Texas, which claims to have produced five times as many books about itself as any other state, the Mexican retaking of the Alamo and a chunk of the Texas economy might seem like yet another indignity. But lately, Texans have suffered worse at the hands of the other 49 United States.
 All the state's largest banks and most of its native retailers are owned by people based in places like Ohio and New York. The Neiman-Marcus corporate headquarters is in Chestnut Hill, Mass. Texans who used to boast bumper stickers that said, "Let the Yankees Freeze in the Dark" are now humbly, and futilely, begging Washington for tariffs on imported oil and other petroleum industry subsidies.
 For decades, national broadcasting, retailing and restaurant franchising have been scrubbing regional distinctiveness from Texas, like almost every place outside of Lake Woebegon. A Tex that's more Mex might once again stand out.
 Texas state commerce, transportation, health, environmental and tourism agencies are working with their Mexican counterparts. Texas and the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon have issued brochures titled "Vacaciones en Dos Naciones' or "Two-Nation Vacations." Texan skills -- indeed, passions -- for oil drilling, real estate development and leveraged deal-making are all playing out quite profitably south of the border.
 In August, Texas trotted out its heavyweights for a goodwill mission when the Houston Oilers and Dallas Cowboys drew 112,000 fans to an exhibition game in Mexico City; it was the biggest crowd ever at a National Football League match. Planeloads of Texans flew down to share a tailgate lunch with Mexican business people and trade fistfuls of business cards.
 But Mexicans aren't always about to let the invaders -- derided there as "drybacks" -- make themselves at home. Texan shrimpers who wandered into Mexican waters have been shot at. El Paso dairymen exporting to Ciudad Juarez have had their trucks torched.
 Texans, for their part, are choosy about which Mexicans to welcome. As Dorothy Parker once said about the way the French treat Americans, they are very nice to those who have money. Houston's wealthy Methodist Hospital has an office in Mexico City to lure the sort of patients who pay cash for heart bypasses. But until the state attacked its tax exemption, Methodist provided scant care for Houston's indigents, many of them Mexican.
 In El Paso, much of the big money that buys mountainside homes in gated preserves comes from across the border in Ciudad Juarez. But the area has armed agents every hundred yards for 20 miles to keep out those with only enough money for a bus ride to the river.
 T. R. Fehrenbach, a historian and author in San Antonio, says Texas could become an American Alsace. Just as Alsace, though French, draws its distinctiveness from the German side of the border, so could Texas end up dancing to its own Tejano beat.

HEADLINE: The World;
Bosnia Makes Atlantic Unity An Oxymoron

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia

 BODY:
LIKE a slow cancer, the Bosnian war is eating away at the Atlantic alliance, laying bare a divergence of strategic interests so basic as to raise the question of whether France and Britain can truly be considered America's allies, at least in the way that they were in confronting Moscow during the cold war.
 Last week the issue was Bihac, yet another small, hitherto unknown Muslim enclave in Bosnia under assault from Serbs. The Clinton Administration wanted stronger action beyond the two selective NATO air strikes carried out last week against Serb positions in Croatia and Bosnia. It proposed an immediate demilitarization of the Bihac area backed by the threat of new, more destructive NATO air raids. 
 But, taking positions closer to Russia's than to America's, west European governments balked. In one sense their reasoning was purely practical: Europeans, including the Russians, have peacekeeping troops in harm's way in Bosnia, and Americans do not. But if the American decision not to send troops to Bosnia -- made by the Bush Administration in 1992 and upheld by President Clinton -- has sapped NATO unity, it has also diverted attention from deeper problems.
 The Bosnian war confronts Europeans and Americans with different strategic considerations, whereas the old Soviet threat presented the same overall danger on both sides of the Atlantic and so acted as the super-glue of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
 
Not in Our Backyard
 The first strategic difference is obvious. Bosnia, unlike the Soviet Union, is not an intercontinental threat; the United States has a buffer called the Atlantic Ocean. Europe does not have this luxury. In fact, Bosnia is to France as Chicago is to New York.
 This geographical fact makes European countries, including Russia, more inclined to put a priority on ending the war and helps to explain recent European outrage at President Clinton's decision to stop enforcing the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led Government. Since World War I, Europeans have carried memories of what can happen when they get drawn into taking sides on the treacherous ground of the Balkans.
 The second strategic difference is more subtle, but no less important. It concerns Islam, and the nations' differing views of Bosnia's Muslim community. For the Clinton Administration, the defense of the moderate Islam of the Balkans is also a way to bolster moderate Islamic countries generally -- particularly two crucial and potentially vulnerable allies, Egypt and Turkey -- against Islamic fundamentalism. "We have been pretty careful about reaching out to moderate Islam," said Jonathan Spalter, a spokesman for the National Security Council. "Of course, we have never explicitly stated that there is a beachhead in Sarajevo to check Teheran. But the reason in the rhyme is there."
 That reason is straightforward enough: If fundamentalists in Turkey and Egypt could point to an American abandonment of Bosnia's Muslims, their cause would be strengthened. "America has an eye to a broader Muslim audience in Bosnia," said Mats Berdal of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
 France, traumatized by its recent experience of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria, has taken, along with Britain, a rather more detached and unsympathetic view. Government officials speak privately of their concern over the emergence of any sort of Muslim state in Europe, and note the close relations between the Bosnian Government in Sarajevo and Iran.
 The third strategic difference concerns Serbia. The Clinton Administration has invested heavily in Albania, another moderate Muslim country on the Mediterranean. This investment has had a stabilizing effect, for now, in that America has restrained Albanian ambitions to unite with its people in Macedonia and the Kosovo area of Serbia. But, given the acute Serbo-Albanian tensions in Kosovo where ethnic Albanians are the overwhelming majority, support for Albania sets America on a collision course with Serbia.
 Russia, however, is a traditional ally of the Serbs, and Britain and France have enduring links with Serbia dating back to their alliances during the two World Wars. To some extent, in both Paris and London, Belgrade is still seen as a counterweight to overwhelming German influence in Croatia. All these trans-Atlantic differences have tended to bring Britain, France and Russia somewhat closer, and this month two extraordinary developments occurred.
 The first was a meeting in Paris on Nov. 18 between the French, British and Russian Foreign Ministers -- a gathering that evoked the Triple Entente of the early years of this century, in which France, Britain and Russia allied to resist German and Austro-Hungarian expansion. At the meeting this month, Alain Juppe, Douglas Hurd and Andrei Kozyrev called for renewed unity of purpose within the "contact group" on solving the Bosnian problem. That appeal was addressed to the United States, which from a European perspective broke ranks through the arms embargo decision. Thus Britain, France and Russia united, at least momentarily, to speak to America.
 
Going It Alone
 The second development was an agreement between Britain and France to establish their first joint military organization, to coordinate air forces in peacekeeping and relief missions. It was a small step, but one suggestive of a British feeling that the special relationship with America should be hedged.
 Over all, in a season when President Clinton is promoting a Pacific economic community and preparing for a Miami summit to seek unity in the American hemisphere, it seems clear that Europe is now the area most neglected by the Administration. In this context, the disarray over Bihac was a mere detail, but a telling one. NATO still needs reinvention, to deal with small towns in Bosnia, but also post-Communist European security as a whole. Bosnia has revealed profound strategic shifts. They must be dealt with if Europe and America are to unite within NATO to make an impression on the Balkan parties, whose history has given them a deep understanding of the effectivenss of force and the weakness of incoherent alliances.

HEADLINE: The World -- The New Trade Treaty;
A Quick Ramble in a Thicket of Rules

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IT'S a scary thing, this GATT, if only because its name sounds so unfriendly and its details are so obscure. The treaty sets new rules for international commerce by revising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It is so enormous that President Clinton needed 4,004 pages to explain to Congress what he was asking it to pass, with no amendments allowed.
 The number of people who have read, and understood, all those pages is no doubt small. 
 If you did read them, though, you would learn a lot of things, some easily as informative as the small print on cereal boxes.
 There are four paragraphs, for example, on how to determine if that cheese your supermarket is importing is really "soft ripened cow's milk cheese." You could learn that the United States has promised to cut its tariff on Hungarian currant jam -- an Eastern European folk remedy for coughs and sore throats -- from 3 percent to 1.35 percent. As part of its effort to reciprocate, Hungary will cut its tariff on American tobacco from 80 percent to 48 percent.
 Some other items are clearly worth knowing about. Some are beneficial; others look good but have no substance. And the treaty creates a new organization that could have a profound effect on the way trade is conducted around the world.
 The immediate good news for Americans is fairly sparse. This is a deal that is composed of innumerable little deals, which go into effect one by one over the course of a decade. Here are some highlights.

QUICK BARGAINS
 Toys will get cheaper, and soon -- but not soon enough for Christmas. And most tariffs on pharmaceuticals will disappear immediately.
 There aren't many toys being made in this country, so there wasn't much opposition to eliminating the tariff -- or tax, if you want to be accurate about it -- on toys. Now importers pay a tax of 8 percent to 12 percent of the wholesale value of the toys. On Jan. 1, assuming congressional ratification, that will drop to zero, costing Uncle Sam about $400 million a year.
 No doubt much of the savings will be passed along to parents of demanding children, while the rest will fatten the profit margins of toy companies.
 There are another 1,500 items that Congress determined in recent years were not made in the United States, so there was no reason to levy tariffs on them. The tariffs on those items used to be suspended, but were re-imposed two years ago as a device to shave the budget deficit. Now they will be repealed, costing the Government about $500 million a year. They include some specialty chemicals and equipment to make everything from textiles to semiconductors.

SAVINGS? WHAT SAVINGS?
 For many developing countries, opening the United States and Europe to more imports of fabric and clothing was a key demand. But the developed countries have their own textile industries crying for protection, so the changes will be very slow and tariffs will be cut less than on most other goods. Most of the moves to liberalize textile imports are slated for the next century, with 49 percent of them to be made on Dec. 31, 2004. There is widespread suspicion among developing countries, says Peter Sutherland, the director general of GATT, that the United States will find a way to get out of making the changes then.
 Before succumbing to the temptation to feel sorry for the developing countries, though, it may be worth noting that they generally won't have to do as much to open their own markets as the major industrial economies will. And in some cases they won't have to do anything. Chile, for example, now can collect 35 percent tariffs on a wide variety of imports. Under the new deal, it will cut that to 25 percent. That sounds impressive, until you find out that Chile doesn't charge the maximum now. In most cases, it charges 11 percent. So exporters to Chile will see no savings, even though they can rest easy that Chile won't turn around and increase tariffs as much as it might have done.

I JUST WANNA TARIFFY . . .
 Even when tariff cuts are real, it may be hard to notice them. The American tariff on VCR's and camcorders will fall from 3.9 percent to 2 percent over the next five years, at a rate of 0.38 percentage points a year -- in other words, less than a dollar a year for most VCR's.
 But in some cases where there was no tariff, there now will be one, and some of those new tariffs will be in the hundreds of percent. That is because the rules on agriculture require countries with quotas -- that is to say, almost everybody -- to instead set high tariffs that initially will keep out as much as the quota did. Theoretically, the high tariffs will be reduced over time, gradually letting in more foreign goods. This is called "tariffication" by the trade lawyers.
 Unfortunately, there is a widespread suspicion that many countries are setting their tariff levels higher than they should, so that liberalization will not in fact be letting in much at all. This has a name too: "dirty tariffication."
 For example, the United States has promised to let in a bit more foreign dairy products. The combined quota for butter and sour cream will rise from 8.7 million pounds in 1995 to 15.4 million in 2000. The butter brought in under that quota will have a tariff of just 5.8 cents per pound. Then you can import all you want -- as long as you pay a tax of at least 70 cents a pound.

BUREAUCRATS, BUREAUCRATS
 The GATT accord establishes a new World Trade Organization, whose panels will decide if countries are violating the new rules. If a country is found to be in violation, it is supposed to correct this or pay damages. But the W.T.O. has no way to force that, and the only sanction it can exercise is to authorize retaliation by the unhappy country.
 A realist might say that such an enforcement mechanism is tilted in favor of big countries. If the United States thinks Bangladesh has acted unfairly, for example, it has a wide variety of trade tactics available with which to punish the offender. Bangladesh, on the other hand, might have a hard time thinking of an effective way to retaliate if the United States wrongly kept out one of its exports.
 Just how the new W.T.O. will work out is a great worry to some. In agreeing to support the treaty last week, Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, got an agreement to establish a panel of Federal judges that will consider whether W.T.O. hearing and appellate panels treat the United States fairly, with a threat of withdrawing if the judges find the panels unfair. Those panels will be able to hear a wide variety of disputes, and their decisions, including appeals, are to be made within 18 months -- a time that seems fast only if you are used to dealing with current GATT proceedings, which can be stalled almost indefinitely.
 There is disagreement on just how much the United States is restrained from acting alone to pursue trade disputes without going to the W.T.O. The accord's language on this is murky, and it is possible that a unilateral U.S. action could end up before a W.T.O. panel. It is even possible that the W.T.O., by a vote of its members, could decide against the United States. But that would take a vote by three-quarters of the countries in the W.T.O., and that doesn't seem likely.

LAWYERS, LAWYERS
 Liberalizing trade is supposed to result in additional wealth for all sides, an idea that has been embraced by economists at least since Adam Smith. A study by GATT estimates that by the time all the new changes are in place, in 2005, world incomes will be up more than $500 billion a year. Well, maybe.
 But it is clear that one group will benefit much more quickly. Lawyers specializing in international trade are likely to find plenty of work as they sort through the thousands of pages of agreements. Senator Dole's success in getting one more place to argue -- the panel of American judges -- will only increase those employment opportunities.
 If all this threatens to drive you to drink, cheer up. Tariffs on imported booze are going down. The tab on imported beer falls from 1.6 cents a liter to zero over the next six years. And tariffs on whiskey and brandy will fall to zero by 2005. But there will still be tariffs on so-called white spirits, such as gin and vodka. That's because Japan, fearful of an influx of imported sake, wouldn't go along with eliminating them.

New Economy Dashes Old Notions of Growth

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
EVERYWHERE, companies are telling the same sort of story, whose message is this: The American economy may be capable of generating more production and prosperity -- without inflation -- than either the statistics or conventional theory acknowledge.
 Chase Manhattan Bank in New York is one of the storytellers. It once had 100 data-processing centers in Europe and the United States. There are two now, in New York and London, that turn out more work than all 100, with far fewer people, says Craig D. Goldman, Chase's chief technology officer. If the New York center is overloaded, work is shifted to London, where the computers are idle during Europe's nighttime. "When we need extra capacity, we can get it rapidly overseas," Mr. Goldman said.
 
From 6 Seconds to 3
 The Eaton Corporation's factory in Kearney, Neb., which manufactures engine valves for auto companies, also stretches production and capacity in ways the Government doesn't measure. For Stephen R. Hardis, Eaton's vice chairman, "capacity is a very fluid kind of thing that keeps growing." Each month, Eaton gets a little more production with the same number of workers. The packing of valves in boxes was automated recently, and the chrome-plating process was redesigned so that each valve is plated now in three seconds instead of six. 
 The Chase and Eaton experiences, multiplied many times, are eroding dogma inherited from the 1970's and 1980's. The dogma hold that the economy cannot increase its production of goods and services by more than 2.5 percent a year for long without running into shortages, although many manufacturing and service companies, like Chase and Eaton, tell of faster growth.
 According to the dogma, an Eaton should no longer meet the demand for valves, and a Chase would have to turn away customers. They would ration consumption of their products by raising prices, and the inflation rate would rise. But fearful their customers might switch to other suppliers, the Eatons and Chases are not raising their prices. Instead, they are finding ways to fill the orders.
 This deviation from economic dogma produces puzzling statistics. Officially, corporate America is operating at a very high 84.6 percent of potential capacity, according to the Government's data. And for 15 months now, the economy has been expanding at an annual rate of more than 4 percent, well above the growth that in theory is possible without rising inflation. But the annual inflation rate, a mild 2.8 percent, has not budged.
 Inevitably, economists are debating the accuracy of their assumptions. Some point to the stories that companies like Chase and Eaton tell as evidence that American companies are squeezing out more production than the data say is possible without inflation -- sometimes enlisting overseas facilities, as Chase does, to satisfy demand.
 Still others say the heralded efficiencies are exaggerated, and the inflation problem will soon appear, reconfirming the old beliefs. "My feeling is that the economy cannot keep growing like this; inflation has to kick in, as it has in the past," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant.
 The debate can turn old believers into converts, or at least agnostics. Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist, is a convert. "The fact that inflation has departed from its historical pattern in this recovery makes one think there has been a change," he said. "I just don't know, and the advice I would give is that since we are not likely to run research that will answer that question in the near future, we need to understand, in making policy, that we do not know."
 Agnosticism is also evident in the Clinton Administration, which is reluctant to act on its doubts. "We are monitoring the literature," said Alicia Munnell, Treasury's assistant secretary for economic policy. "We hope that potential economic growth is greater than it was, but we don't want to be the first out of the box to assume this."
 Neither does the Federal Reserve, although some Fed officials express similar doubts. Acting on the standard wisdom that the economy is now operating at full capacity, the Fed has raised interest rates six times this year, to slow growth and thus prevent a surge of inflation. The danger is that today's brisk recovery will be cut off unnecessarily, and unemployment will rise.
 Labor, of course, is a major factor in potential economic growth. A worker shortage can hold back growth. So can the failure of workers to function efficiently, by making the best use of Chase's new computer centers or Eaton's new machinery.
 Government statistics suggest that efficiency, or productivity, is not rising all that fast, despite corporate reports to the contrary. The official unemployment rate, now only 5.8 percent, suggests that labor shortages will soon permit workers to insist on higher wages, which then feed inflation.
 
Wages Trail Inflation
 But wages are not rising anywhere in the country faster than inflation. That's the case at Eaton's Kearney plant, although the plant, like many others, has added a shift. That shift is staffed mainly through overtime, and with temporary workers. Nebraska has a lower unemployment rate than the nation, but the "temps" somehow materialize, attracted by Eaton's wage of just above $10 an hour -- although the temps go without benefits. "They take three months to train, and then often leave after nine months," said Joseph P. Palchak, an Eaton executive. "But that is less expensive than getting stuck with permanent staffers who would not be needed once the demand dies down."

Deciding Who Gets What in America

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
UNDER the House Republicans' "Contract With America," certain groups, like unwed teen-age mothers and able-bodied unemployed men, are deemed undeserving of the Government's largess. Both groups were excoriated in campaign rhetoric and cut off from public assistance in the contract's sketchy budget proposals.
 But these same budgetary figures reveal something the rhetoric did not. Among the ranks of the undeserving, by implication, is a group that has played by the rules, paid taxes, and demonstrated family values: legal immigrants. These are not people who sneaked across the border. They were granted visas to rejoin family members, to work, or, often, both. 
 The Republicans reckon that they can save more than $21 billion over five years by barring legal immigrants from 60 programs, including Medicaid, food stamps and welfare. David Super, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute that studies antipoverty programs, points out that illegal immigrants "are already ineligible for most major Federal programs."
 The emphasis on citizenship as a litmus test goes beyond anything envisioned in Proposition 187, the measure just approved by California voters and put on hold by Federal courts, to bar illegal aliens from most public social services. Gov. Pete Wilson of California, an outspoken supporter of that measure, repeatedly said he intended no harm to legal aliens.
 The effort to curtail benefits for legal immigrants, who pay taxes and serve in the armed forces, represents a profound shift in national attitudes. But it is not one the Clinton Administration can easily criticize. The President's own welfare bill is financed, in part, by tightening eligibility rules for aliens who seek food stamps and welfare. Rather than banning them from such programs, the President would require American citizens to take greater financial responsibility for immigrants whose entry they sponsor.
 Charles H. Wheeler, director of the National Immigration Law Center, a legal services organization that helps lawyers representing immigrants, said that public animosity to illegal aliens has been spilling over into the attitudes toward legal migrants. "Politicians are looking for ways to save money," he said.
 "Instead of carving out a group of people who are abusing the system," he added, "they take the politically expedient and safe route of cutting off a group of people on the basis of citizenship, or lack of it. That sends a message to these legal aliens that they are less deserving."
 
For the People?
 Despite the country's history as a nation of immigrants, popular opinion in the United States has continually vacillated on the question of whom the Government is meant to serve: its people, or just its citizens. At times, the Government mandate has been broadly inclusive. At other times, it has been read narrowly.
 The Republican proposal can find resonance in two centuries of debate about the meaning and privileges of citizenship. From a review of that history, including numerous Supreme Court decisions, three points seem clear: First, if Congress wanted to deny welfare and other Government benefits to legal aliens, it could do so, by virtue of its plenary authority over immigration.
 Second, states, by contrast, have very limited authority to impose such discriminatory burdens on aliens because the restrictions conflict with the Federal Government's power to regulate immigration. And third, while Congress could make citizenship a prerequisite for getting public assistance, such action would flout traditions that run deep in America's political culture.
Alexander M. Bickel, a constitutional scholar who taught for many years at Yale Law School, wrote that "the concept of citizenship plays only the most minimal role in the American constitutional scheme." The makers of the French Revolution called one another "citizen" to reaffirm their participation in the state, he noted in "The Morality of Consent" (Yale University Press, 1975). But it was "We the People of the United States," not the citizens of the United States, who established a Constitution for this country.
 The Bill of Rights defines rights of people, not citizens. The Founding Fathers and their contemporaries were citizens of individual states, but there was no definition of United States citizenship in the Constitution until the 14th Amendment was added in 1868. This was needed, in part, to overrule the Supreme Court's decision in the Dred Scott case, which held that members of "the enslaved African race" were not citizens and were therefore excluded from "the political community created by the Constitution."
 The Dred Scott decision exalted the importance of citizenship as a factor in deciding whether someone was entitled to certain rights and privileges, and that was unusual in American history. In practice, permanent resident aliens have most of the rights -- and obligations -- of citizens, the most conspicuous exception being the right to vote in Federal elections.
 
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier . . .
 Legal aliens, of course, are not a monolithic group. Some are entrepreneurs, some are business executives and some teach at universities, while others clean people's houses or pump gas. Some have been here just a year or two; others, for decades. But all, saving only those admitted as refugees and living in the country less than six years, would be affected by the House Republicans' proposal.
 Given the current political climate, few officials have stepped forward to defend immigrants' rights to welfare benefits. And since aliens do not vote, they cannot elect anyone to champion their cause. But a wide range of Hispanic, Asian-American, Roman Catholic and Jewish organizations have formed a coalition to preserve their access to social services.
 Justifying its proposal, the Administration said there had been a sharp increase in the number of legal aliens collecting Supplemental Security Income, a form of welfare for people who are aged, blind or disabled. "Immigrants rose from 5 percent of the S.S.I. aged caseload in 1982 to over 25 percent of the caseload in 1992," it said. "Since 1982, applications for S.S.I. from immigrants have tripled, while immigration rose by only about 50 percent over the period."
 Many Federal laws distinguish between citizens and aliens, but the line separating permanent residents from other aliens is, in some ways, more significant. The green card, certifying status as a permanent resident, creates so many opportunities for immigrants they often feel no need to become citizens.
 That could change. Mr. Wheeler, of the National Immigration Law Center, predicted that if the Republican proposal becomes law, "a lot of permanent residents will become citizens so they can retain eligibility for public benefits."

DEMOCRATIC PARTY STRUGGLES TO FIND NEW EQUILIBRIUM

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Three weeks after their top-to-bottom electoral wipeout, Democrats remain uncertain over what to do next and virtually leaderless beyond a President whom many in the party see as a big part of their problems.
Division, of course, is traditional among losing parties, and among Democrats even in the best of times. But their current disarray has left a near vacuum for triumphant Republicans that is compounding the Democrats' midterm disaster. 
 By contrast, despite their drubbing in the 1992 campaign and the party's internal rifts over social issues, Republicans quickly coalesced around their opposition to President Clinton. Setting aside divisive issues like abortion, they fell back on an anti-tax, anti-Government rallying cry that, combined with a strategy of blocking Democratic initiatives, served the party well.
But Democrats do not have such a common rallying point. Still shell-shocked, they cannot agree on what the party needs to do to make a comeback or, in the more dire words of some partisans, to survive. In dozens of interviews, prominent Democrats offered conflicting advice to the President and the party:
Move to the center; move to the right; pay more attention to the liberal base; work with the new Republican leadership in Congress; take on the Republican leadership in Congress; communicate the President's achievements better.
And as Republicans grab attention with grand plans to retool Government, Democrats seem ominously invisible, their leaders defeated or retired.
Senate Democrats have yet to pick a replacement for Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader who did not seek re-election.
Nor is there a leader for House Democrats. The current Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, was denied re-election to his Congressional seat. And the party chairman, David Wilhelm, out of favor with the White House, departed immediately after the election and has been replaced temporarily by Debra DeLee, a little-known former lobbyist for an education association.
That leaves Mr. Clinton to carry all the duties as party spokesman. But he, too, has been struggling to deal with the new balance of power. The President's muddled response to the proposal by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Speaker-in-waiting, for a Constitutional amendment on school prayer only seemed to underscore the Democrats' difficult position. They are used to losing the White House, but not both houses of Congress.
"It's clear that the Gingrich Republicans have their act together right now," said Representative James Moran, a Virginia Democrat, "and it's not clear that the Democrats do as yet because of the whole new environment. Republicans expected the tsunami to hit; the Democrats were totally unprepared for it."
In the last week, some Congressional Democrats have begun to speak up, most notably Representative Richard Gephardt, the majority leader from Missouri, and Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who is seeking to succeed Mr. Mitchell. But even their comments have essentially come in reaction to Republican plans or statements.
One strategy the party is experimenting with is trying to turn Mr. Gingrich into its target, much as the Republicans did to Mr. Clinton. But despite Mr. Gingrich's outspokenness and a steadfast conservatism that may not be universally popular, the American public may welcome as refreshing his effort to consolidate the Government and make Congress more accountable.
Some Democrats view this year's elections as a temporary setback brought on by an unpopular President. But others are worried that the working- and middle-class voters on whom the party has relied may be hard to recapture.
These striking differences are demonstrated in the opinions of Democratic chairmen of two large states, California and Ohio. Bill Press, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, sounded like Newt Gingrich, the Speaker-in-waiting, when he likened the party's image problems to 1972, the year that George McGovern tugged the Democratic Party's image to the left by winning the Presidential nomination.
"We're seen as the party that cares about African Americans," Mr. Press said, "the party that cares about Latinos, the party that cares about gays, the party that cares about women -- and doesn't give a damn about white males. We aren't saying anything to that base."
But Harry Meshel, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, represents a school of thought -- one that many Democrats repeated throughout the campaign season -- that the party is appealing to the proper constituencies and pushing the proper issues, but is simply failing to communicate its accomplishments.
"It's a matter of merchandising, of public relations, in which we failed," Mr. Meshel said. "We need a public relations firm that communicates the Democratic Party's policies."
Some of Mr. Clinton's closest advisers are also still arguing that the there was no fundamental flaw in how the President has run the country. "We did not do as nearly an effective job as we could have in articulating our message," said Harold Ickes, a deputy chief of staff. He added that the most important challenge for Mr. Clinton is "to keep a strong economy going."
But Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico argued that it was "copping out to say that the public didn't understand our message." He added: "We don't have to move right. We don't have to move left. We have to regain our base."
An important question is whether Democratic officeholders strike out on their own, independent of an unpopular President, or whether they try to work with him. Many Democrats on Capitol Hill fear that relations between the White House and Democrats in Congress will only worsen, making it even more difficult for Democrats to resurrect themselves.
"The more the right wing beats up on him and the more they demonize him, the more people up here are going to get away from him," said a Democratic Senator, known as a supporter of Mr. Clinton and who asked not to be identified. "They'll isolate him."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said such behind-the-scenes talk among his fellow Democrats is misplaced. "There's a risk in Republicans not working with the President and there's a risk in Democrats not working with the President," he said.
But a more liberal Democratic Senator, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, said the proper course would be for Mr. Clinton and the Democrats in Congress to challenge the Republican leaders, not cave in to their new-found influence. He, for one, said he was poised to do what he could to block Republican proposals in the Senate.
"I will be ready to go to the floor with lots of amendments," Mr. Wellstone said. "Democrats need to be very strong both in opposition to cuts that are mean-spirited and wrong for the nation and to have very clear policy alternatives."
Gary LaPaille, the party chairman in Illinois, agreed, saying: "Don't attempt to think that Gingrich and Dole are going to be your friend. These are two lions, and when you go to the zoo you don't put your hands in the lion's cage."
As a first step, the party needs to find a chairman. Mr. Clinton this month appointed Ms. DeLee until he can figure out whom he wants to place in the position. The party will vote on a new chairman in January.
Some veteran party strategists questioned why Mr. Clinton turned to a little-known caretaker rather than making a bold statement by appointing a high-profile figure to lead the party into the 1996 Presidential campaign.
But part of the problem is that White House officials and other leading Democrats are not sure what they want in a chairman. Some want a good spokesman who will come off well on television. Others say it is more important to find someone who is skilled at raising money and fielding the often conflicting demands from the White House, Democrats in Congress and state party officials.
There is no indication that Mr. Clinton has settled on anyone. Several people are being mentioned as possible successors to Ms. DeLee, including several who lost elections, like Kathleen Brown, who ran for governor of California, and Representative Mike Synar of Oklahoma, who lost in his primary. Others include former Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia and former Representative Dennis E. Eckart of Ohio. Gov. Ann Richards of Texas was mentioned, but said she was not interested in the job.
But many Democrats do not want a losing candidate to head the party. "That just sends a terrible signal," Mr. LaPaille said. "For the next two years, he or she would have to explain why he or she lost the race. It would be a constant tag after their name. I don't think we need that."

It may be the most confounding acronym in American foreign policy: GATT, shorthand for a vast international trade agreement that has been negotiated for so long that the founder of one of the world's great trading centers, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, once called it the General Agreement to Talk and Talk.
In the coming week, the talking about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will yield to decision-making. Congress, meeting in a lame-duck session that initially threatened to be the setting of the first power struggle between the Clinton Administration and a Republican opposition that will be in the Capitol Hill majority come January, is to vote up or down on a sweeping, 124-nation overhaul of GATT. 
 Although passage was in doubt just a few days ago, an accord reached on Wednesday between President Clinton and Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, seems to have paved the way for the biggest change in world trading rules in two generations.
But the questions on which the political bickering focused remain. Among them are these:
*Is Congress, as critics of GATT argue, about to give the World Trade Organization, an international tribunal that would be created by the new agreement, the power to sit in judgment of American laws?
*Will the new organization force Washington and the states to choose between paying penalties and changing their consumer-protection, environmental and labor laws if it judges those laws an impediment to trade?
*And if the United States becomes a favorite target of the new organization, is Washington really prepared to walk away from GATT, which 10 Presidents took 46 years to build?
"In the end, this is a system that is far more likely to protect the United States than hurt it," said John H. Jackson, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, an authority on the workings of a trade arrangement that is becoming as central to containing international power struggles as arms control agreements were in the 1980's.
Professor Jackson is among the strongest proponents of the new World Trade Organization. But he quickly acknowledges that "our policy makers tend to downplay our obligations if the United States loses rulings, and of course we will lose some."
"We cannot thumb our nose at this organization," he said, "if we want to be taken seriously when we bring complaints against the rest of the world."
The World Trade Organization is the most divisive element of an agreement that involves virtually every major trading nation -- the notable exception is China, which has not yet opened its markets enough to join -- and tens of thousands of products. The pact would dramatically lower tariffs, the charges that nations impose on imported goods in an effort to protect their own industries. And it would extend protection to patented and copyrighted matter and other intellectual property, a step the United States hopes will greatly benefit Americans whose work is now widely pirated: computer makers, recording artists, movie makers and scientists.
Among the opponents of the World Trade Organization are people who otherwise agree on very little: Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate; Ross Perot and Patrick J. Buchanan, both former Presidential candidates; Jesse Helms, preparing to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a raft of environmentalists.
Their arguments vary in the details. But all contend that Congress is on the verge of handing away more authority than it realizes in a 22,000-page agreement that has been read by almost no one and will be debated for only a few hours next week.
Here is an example that frames their essential argument:
If the United States, moved by accounts of miserable working conditions abroad, blocked the import of rugs made by child labor in South Asia, for instance, countries that were hurt by the move could take their case to a panel of three World Trade Organization judges, each from a nation that was not a party to the dispute.
The judges would hold hearings in secret, as diplomatic tradition dictates. And if they ruled against the United States, Congress or the state whose law or regulation was under challenge would have to decide whether to change it. If the lawmakers refused, and if the United States then lost an appeal lodged with all the pact's member nations, trade sanctions could be imposed, penalizing American exporters.
Environmentalists say this system would make the United States, with its many environmental regulations exceeding standards elsewhere, a natural target.
In 1991, under existing GATT rules whose enforcement provisions are far weaker than those in the pact before Congress, the United States was on the losing end of a challenge brought against a Federal law blocking the import of tuna that had been caught in nets that also trapped dolphins. A GATT panel ruled that however laudable the goal of saving dolphins, the United States could not impose its environmental restrictions on the rest of the world. Otherwise, the panel said, America could use those regulations as protective cover to keep out foreign competitors.
Mr. Nader argues that the World Trade Organization would lock the United States into a system that gives trade priority over everything else. "Is the requirement to install air bags in cars a restriction on imports?" he said. "Maybe so. Fuel efficiency regulations? Requirements to label food packages? These could all be called restrictions to foreign trade."
The Congressional votes are scheduled for Tuesday in the House, where passage requires only a simple majority, and for Thursday in the Senate, whose rules require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes.
Congress has been through a nearly identical debate before, during the Truman Administration.
At the opening of the postwar era, GATT was only an agreement, not an organization. Rulings on trade were supposed to come from the International Trade Organization, whose powers were to be much broader than those now envisioned for the World Trade Organization. But President Harry S. Truman could never get approval of the International Trade Organization through Congress, which feared, as many do today, that it would be surrendering sovereignty to a group of foreign judges.
The result over the last 40 years has been an ad hoc series of procedures that satisfy no one. Although the tiny GATT secretariat began to take up trade complaints, its powers were limited. The organization now operates by consensus, difficult to achieve since more than 100 countries are now part of the system, and any nation that loses a ruling can veto any sanctions levied against it.
In a 1988 resolution, Congress instructed American negotiators to come up with a tough dispute-resolution system so that Washington could move against foreign powers that blocked the import of American goods -- specifically Japan, the European Union and third-world nations that often protect their home markets.
"It's easy to forget that we were the ones that pushed for tighter rules," said I. M. Destler, an economist at the University of Maryland who is an expert on the history of trade disputes. "And now we are the only nation complaining about it.
"We have always wanted a much stronger mechanism, but we want it both ways. The United States is not one of the best compliers when rulings go against us."
In private, Administration officials make an argument in favor of the World Trade Organization that they are reluctant to make in public: Few countries, they say, will be willing to take on an economy the size and power of the United States -- or, for that matter, Japan. The risks of retaliation are too high.
"We are a huge market for the rest of the world, and most countries will want to stay on our good side," one of Mr. Clinton's senior trade officials said the other day. "At least, we think they will."

THE OVERVIEW
Seven months later than originally scheduled, Congress will take up an overhaul of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade this week. The trade pact is so dense -- it fills four telephone-directory sized books -- and so Byzantine that almost no one voting on it has more than a sketchy understanding of its contents. But most do know this: that 124 nations are expected to approve the agreement, that it would vastly reduce the tariffs that almost all nations in the world use to protect their farmers and their native industries and that it would rewrite the world's free trade rules.
This would be the eighth time GATT has been expanded since its creation in 1948.
From the start, one of America's main goals in the negotiations was to make sure that enforcement procedures were strnegthened, so that GATT rulings against countries that violate the free trade rules could not be ignored. Paradoxically, that it now the major source of contention in Congress, with many members warning that the first target of the stronger procedures would be the United States.
The new agreement also includes vast reductions in national protections against agricultural imports. Agriculture has been sidestepped in past GATT agreements, and its inclusion in this one led to occasionally violent protests from farmers in France, Japan and South Korea, among other nations, who warned that imports would ruin their livelihood. In total, the United States estimates that the tariff cuts would total more than $700 billion, amounting to a huge worldwide cut in taxes that consumers ultimately pay at the checkout counter.
The agreement would also require for the first time broad protection of intellectual property to curb piracy of everything from Bruce Springstein compact disks to the circuit layouts of computer chips.
But the agreement falls far short of bringing about an era of true free trade. Many tariffs would remain. Efforts to expand rules to cover services like insurance, banking and shipping got almost nowhere. Nor would Europe cut many of its national subsidies for commercial aircraft.
 
THE PROCEDURE and THE POLTICS
Early this year President Clinton said the United States would sign the pact by last April, paving the way for other nations to approve it. But both the Administration and Congress delayed and delayed, and many other countries have refused to sign until the United States, the world's largest economy, takes the plunge. The agreement is supposed to go into force on Jan. 1, and that deadline, combined with the politics of the Congressional campaign, forced the special lame-duck session of Congress.
With the delays, however, opposition to the pact has grown considerably. Conservative Democrats, especially from states that produce textiles, warn that lower tariffs would result in a flood of more imports that threaten American jobs. They have been joined by some conservative Republicans who contend that the accord allows foreign judges to rule on whether American laws are trade barriers -- and thus gives away American sovereignty.
But there can be no tinkering with the contents of the agreement. Under rules Congress passed to make negotiations over trade pacts with so many countries workable, the House and the Senate must decide on the GATT agreement by simple yes or no votes. A simple majority is required in the House, three-fifths in the Senate.
The Administration has agreed to several pieces of additional legislation to satisfy some special interests who otherwise would oppose the pact. The latest side deals were struck on Wednesday with Senator Bob Dole, the future Senate majority leader, who has now agreed to support the pact. He predicts that it will now pass with ease.
 
THE BASICS
A NEW TRADE ORGANIZATION -- Until now, trade rules have been enforced by the GATT organization, which has little power. The new agreement would create a new institution, the World Trade Organization, with far more power to assess trade penalties against member nations.
Critics of the pact say that the new organization could quickly turn against the United States, attacking its consumer protection laws, its worker welfare protections and environmental regulations as trade barriers. The White House says that is an exaggerated fear. Under an agreement reached with Senator Dole on Wednesday, President Clinton has agreed to set up a commission in the United States to review judgments that the World Trade Organization issues against the United States.
TARIFFS -- The 124 nations have agreed to reduce their tariffs by an average of one-third. Agricultural tariffs would be reduced by 36 percent in industrial nations and 24 percent in developing nations.
HEALTH AND SAFETY -- The agreement bars countries from administering health and safety standards in ways that restrict trade and have no scientific basis. For example, a country that raised cattle without hormones could not use health grounds to ban imports of beef with hormones unless it could prove that the hormones were unsafe for human consumption.
QUOTAS -- These are limits on the quantity of imports. Japan, for example, currently bans the import of foreign rice. The United States limits imports of peanuts, dairy products and sugar to a set amount each year. Many countries limit the import of textiles and finished apparel. Under the new agreement, quotas would be illegal, although countries would be allowed to replace quotas with tariffs. Tariffs would then be gradually reduced.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY -- The agreement requires all signatories, including developing countries, to protect patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks. For years, pirated computer programs, record albums, videocassettes and prescription drugs have been available in developing nations.
LOCAL CONTENT The agreement bans the widespread practice of requiring high local content in some products like cars, rules that are designed to preserve local jobs and discourage imports. The agreement would also limit the ability of countries to favor domestically-owned factories at the expense of foreign-owned ones.
 
WHAT'S AT STAKE
President Clinton argues that because American industry is among the most competitive in the world and because other countries would have to lower tariffs more than Washington would, the American economy would be the biggest winner. Certainly high-tech companies, from Boeing to Intel to Microsoft, have an enormous amount to gain.
Consumers should see more than $11 billion in gains by the year 2000 because lower tariffs and greater competition from foreign goods should result in lower prices. But some American producers, including makers of textiles, would definitely lose out. Labor unions argue that the biggest victims would be American workers, put out of jobs by imports coming from countries that pay their workers little, use child labor, freely pollute the environment or run unsafe factories.
 
MAJOR INDUSTRIES THAT ARE AFFECTED
AGRICULTURE -- The big dispute that held up the talks for years was a quarrel between the United States and the European Community over farm subsidies. In the end, the United States agreed to allow the Europeans to subsidize more grain exports over the next six years than previously planned, while the Europeans agreed to convert some of their quotas on farm imports into low tariffs. Japan agreed to lift its ban on the import of foreign rice.
AUTOMOBILES -- Over the years, the United States and the European Community have each forced Japan to accept limits on its auto exports. The current agreement text would virtually ban these restrictions. Each country would only be allowed one such export limit on any foreign industry.
TEXTILES AND APPAREL -- More prosperous nations would be required to phase out quotas on clothing imports over a 10-year period. The quotas would then be replaced by less restrictive tariffs. Some of the strongest opposition to GATT in the United States has come from textile states, including North and South Carolina.
 
MAJOR INDUSTRIES THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED
AIRCRAFT -- The United States and the European Community are still talking about limiting government subsidies to civil aircraft makers. Meanwhile, a 1992 deal stays in effect that requires the European aviation consortium Airbus Industrie to repay many European nations that subsidize its operations, and limits indirect American subsidies to aircraft makers through military contracts.
AUDIOVISUAL -- While the text of the accord contains broad principles espousing free trade in movies, television programs and music recordings, neither side would put these principles into effect. Because the United States still objects to the Europeans' restrictions on the broadcast of American movies and television programs, further trade confrontations on this issue are likely.
FINANCIAL SERVICES -- While the agreement includes broad principles to allow commercial and investment banks, insurance and leasing companies, traveler's check issuers and mortgage brokers to do business around the world, few nations have agreed to put the principles into effect.
SHIPPING -- Although the pact includes broad free trade principles, the United States and the European Community have agreed to exempt all their current shipping-trade restrictions.
STEEL -- The United States and the Europeans are still talking about limiting European subsidies to steel makers.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- The United States and the European Community are still talking about allowing telecommunications companies to offer long-distance telephone service and other services in any nation. Most European nations still have a single giant telephone company like the old Bell System, with monopoly rights to offer some kinds of services. David E. Sanger (pg. 32)

HEADLINE: Financial Crisis Hangs Over District of Columbia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
A man approached the information desk at the District of Columbia's Department of Motor Vehicles the other day and wanted to know how crowded it might be the day after Thanksgiving for a driver's license test.
A woman behind the counter looked glum. "We may not be open," she said. "The city is so broke, they're talking about furloughs and we may not be here on Friday." 
 She was wrong about the furloughs. The city's outgoing Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, promised to resist asking city workers to stay home as a way to save money.
But the woman at the counter was right about the city's going broke.
The District of Columbia's financial situation has grown so bleak in recent months that Mrs. Kelly's successor, Mayor-elect Marion S. Barry Jr., who takes office on Jan. 2, 1995, called a news conference this week to brace residents. "This is the most serious crisis since home rule," he said, referring to the limited self-government that Congress bequeathed the capital 20 years ago.
The city's budget deficit, approaching $450 million, is so large, Mr. Barry said, that the city could run out of cash to pay employees and contractors by early January.
Mr. Barry said that every city program and agency was under review, a sign that services like street cleaning, trash collecting and pothole fixing are likely to be reduced. Also on the table are benefits for union workers, overtime pay and the survival of the District of Columbia Law School. The local eligibility criteria and benefits for entitlement programs like Medicaid and Aid to Families With Dependent Children are also likely to change.
A committee of experts appointed by Mr. Barry after the election has already proposed detailed cuts of more than $154 million for the 1995 fiscal year. But those are only the first steps toward complying with a Congressional order that the District government scale back by at least 2,000 positions and $140 million in spending, the committee chairman, Elijah B. Rogers, said this week in presenting the report to Mr. Barry.
More urgent, Mr. Rogers said, was finding an additional $291 million in spending cuts to prevent the District from going bankrupt.
And adding to the challenge is the prospect that the incoming Republican-led Congress might be less sympathetic than the outgoing Democrats, especially to a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 10 to 1, blacks outnumber whites by more than 2 to 1 and the Mayor-elect once served prison time for drug possession.
Some House Republicans have said they favored restricting the District's right to borrow money from the Treasury, a move that would undermine the city's ability to repay loans and cause its credit rating to drop.
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the presumed next Speaker of the House, is expected to eliminate the Committee on the District of Columbia as part of House restructuring. Also, he has suggested eliminating voting rights for the District's delegate in Congress. With District residents paying the third-highest per capita Federal taxes (taken together with the 50 states), that suggestion has raised cries of taxation without representation and has led one group to seek ways for largely white and mostly prosperous northwest Washington to secede from the District and rejoin Maryland.
And there is no indication that the new Republicans have any interest in raising the annual Federal payment, now $660 million, that the District receives in lieu of property taxes it cannot collect on real estate owned by the Government and foreign countries.
Caught in the middle of all this is the District's delegate to the House, Eleanor Holmes Norton, who won a third term this month with 89 percent of the vote. A year ago, she helped bring a vote on statehood for the District to the House floor. The measure failed 277 to 153, but the fact that it reached a vote suggested that many members felt the District could be trusted to take care of itself.
But now, with the city's fiscal problems growing to such magnitude and the District fighting to maintain what autonomy it has, Ms. Norton contends that politics will be less critical than immediate steps by the new Barry administration.
"There's not a very large difference between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to D.C. finances," she said in an interview this week. "The attitude is driven by events. If events lead to insolvency, there is no Republican or Democratic way to deal with it except to warn people not to let it happen."
Critics of Mr. Barry point out that he was not a fiscal conservative in his previous years as Mayor, and that he built his formidable political base by adding thousands of government employees and often awarding city contracts on a no-bid basis.
These critics say the future of the District depends heavily on his ability to to eliminate jobs, cut services and make other hard fiscal decisions.
"I don't think he's capable," said Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat who is the outgoing chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia. "He took a city that was growing and prospering and led it toward bankruptcy with his friends, cronies and crooks. It was one big happy romp. I don't know if he can turn all that around."
Mr. Barry acknowledges that under the circumstances he now has no other choice than making cuts. He said that in conversations with Mayor Kelly he had urged her to make the necessary cuts, but that he would continue the process after his inauguration.
"All of us have a responsibility, particularly I do, to lay out for people what we see," he said, referring to the cuts recommended by his committee. "This is not to alarm them, just so they can see it."

HEADLINE: Good and Bad News In State Fiscal Data

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The expanding economy is helping to balance state budgets, but the National Governors Association says long-term financial pressures continue to weigh heavily.
The group's semiannual "Fiscal Survey of the States" showed that income from sales, income and corporate taxes exceeded expectations in almost all states for the 1994 fiscal year, with the total about 1 percent more than anticipated. 
 But Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors association, said that despite this "it is hard to escape the fact that states are staring down the barrel of some major spending pressures."
Medicaid and increased spending on prisons will continue to absorb larger shares of state funds and may force cuts in other areas, Mr. Scheppach said.

HEADLINE: Past Sheds Light on Clinton and School Prayer

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Nov. 23

 BODY:
State Senator Luther Hardin received a telephone call from the Governor one day in June 1985. Bill Clinton wanted to talk about prayer in the schools.
Just days before, the United States Supreme Court struck down an Alabama law, almost identical to the one in Arkansas, that had provided for a period of prayer or silent reflection at the start of each school day. In light of that ruling, Mr. Clinton wanted to pass a new bill. 
 "Governor Clinton wanted to do two things," recalled Mr. Hardin, a Democrat who was persuaded to sponsor the bill. "He wanted to make sure we were square with the Supreme Court decision and not subject to a lawsuit, and he also wanted to preserve a moment of silence or meditation in the public schools of Arkansas. And that's exactly what we did."
As things turned out, enacting the new law without the word "prayer" a few weeks later turned out to be an almost entirely uncontroversial affair, barely remarked upon as legislators became consumed in a separate, deeply divisive battle over home schooling. In fact, religious groups who wanted prayer in the schools and civil-liberties organizations who opposed it both said they came away from the session feeling that Governor Clinton had responded appropriately to the Supreme Court ruling.
The nine-year-old episode in Little Rock is a small piece of legislative history, but it takes on new importance because of recent comments by President Clinton about school prayer. And it provides a useful guide to how he may respond if the issue emerges in the Congress next year; indeed, the President's aides say his views on school prayer are evident in his actions in 1985.
In essence, Governor Clinton said he opposed any formal or organized establishment of prayer or religion in the schools, which he said could be coercive; on the other hand, he strongly supported an authorized moment of silence, which he insisted did not amount to coercion or an endorsement of religion.
But in a news conference at the economic summit meeting in Indonesia last week, Mr. Clinton clouded his position when, asked about a constitutional amendment allowing organized prayer in the schools, he said he "certainly wouldn't rule it out." Republicans who will control the new House of Representatives have promised to offer such a measure.
Mr. Clinton's comments dismayed civil liberties groups, who said such an amendment would breach the constitutional wall between church and state. Aides to Mr. Clinton then scurried to play down his comment, and finally Mr. Clinton himself sought to clarify his position in a Washington news conference on Tuesday, in which he appeared to be against the proposed amendment.
"I think that that is inherently coercive in a nation with the amount of religious diversity we have in this country," he told reporters. "I think that would be an error."
What the President has said would be acceptable, however, is the kind of measure he successfully urged the Legislature to pass here in Little Rock.
When Mr. Clinton became Governor in 1979, Arkansas had a law authorizing a "brief period of silent prayer or meditation" at the opening of each school day for all pupils "who desire to participate." There is no record of Mr. Clinton's having ever said anything to oppose that law.
In 1985, however, after the Supreme Court ruled that use of the word "prayer" in the Alabama statute amounted to an endorsement of religion and was thus unconstitutional, Mr. Clinton moved swiftly. In the new measure, he deleted the word "prayer" and any reference to religion: the state simply allowed "a brief period of silent meditation and reflection with the participation of all students in the classroom who desire to participate."
In what was something of a hallmark of Mr. Clinton's tenure as Governor, he apparently sought, in conversations with various people involved with the issue, to demonstrate that he shared their concerns.
And he basically succeeded. For instance, the Arkansas Education Association, a teachers group opposed to mandatory prayer, was satisfied. "He did the appropriate thing to bring the law into line with the Supreme Court ruling," said Grainger Ledbetter, the group's president.
Even State Representative Jerry D. King, a Republican and an Assembly of God minister who said he strongly supported the rights of students to pray in the schools, said, "It was better than doing nothing."
But at the same time, he said he was not sure where Governor Clinton stood on the matter. "To be perfectly honest with you, these were issues, whether it was abortion or prayer in the schools, he seemed to be elusive on at times," Mr. King said. "In our conversations, the Governor never ever led me to believe he was against prayer in the schools. On the other hand, if you asked me what he was for, I'd have to come back and say, 'Question mark, question mark, question mark.' "
In spite of the attention Governor Clinton gave to the matter, his law was repealed last year as part of a general overhaul of the state's education law, and even appears to have been unnecessary. A period of meditation is clearly still allowed, even though there is no mention of it in the law now, said Kern Treat, the director of the Arkansas Bureau of Legislative Research.
But Rita Spillenger, the executive director of the Arkansas branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the interpretation of the moment of silence seemed to vary by teacher and school board. Some public schools in Arkansas do have organized prayer sessions, which almost certainly would be declared illegal if challenged in court, she said. But she added it was extremely difficult to find plaintiffs for such cases or to find public officials willing to condemn the activity.
In the 1985 discussion of school prayer, Mr. Clinton offered very little public comment on the issue. He was quoted in The Arkansas Gazette as saying at a conference of state employees that periods of silence that did not constitute enforced prayer remained legal under the Supreme Court ruling. "But we might ought to change the law anyway since the Legislature will be in session," he told the group.
Senator Hardin, a Democrat who, like Mr. King, is still in the Legislature nine years later, strongly defended Mr. Clinton and said his views on the issue were clear.
"He's not inconsistent," he said. "Anybody who's making the charge that he's waffled on this has just not studied President Clinton's history. He has always been a supporter of this moment of silence, and in my opinion he could be a supporter of voluntary prayer if approached by the right mechanism."

HEADLINE: Hesitant Norway to Vote on Europe

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BERGEN, Norway, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The meeting was billed as a discussion on whether Norway should join the European Union, but judging from the number of "no" buttons, most of those crowded into the tiny hall in rural Os this week had already made up their minds.
They listened politely while Ranveig Froyland, a member of Parliament, told them that they would be better off and their children's future more secure inside Europe. 
 But when Hallvard Bakke, a former Government aide who opposes membership, declared that Norway should never surrender its authority or its sovereignty to unelected bureacrats in Brussels, the audience of farmers and retirees applauded enthusiastically
"Oslo is already far enough away," said Kristin Hjertaker, a columnist for the local paper in Os, a farming village of 13,000 people on the far southern outskirts of Bergen, a port city on the North Sea. "So people say Brussels is out of the question."
On Monday, the question of whether Norway will make its future inside or outside the European Union will be decided by voters. Norway's neighbors, Sweden and Finland, have already decided to join, in referendums this fall.
But public opinion surveys suggest that Norwegians remain more skeptical than their Scandinavian brethren. The beneficiaries of Europe's largest oil and gas reserves and richest fishery stocks, many Norwegians do not see the advantage of closer economic and political cooperation with the rest of the continent.
"We have aluminum, we have hydroelectric power, we have fish, we have oil, and we have jobs," declared Johan Kjaegard, a 73-year-old retiree passing out anti-European Union literature in Bergen's central square. "We can stay alone and still be friends to everybody."
The most recent series of public opinion polls this week give opponents about 47 percent of the vote and supporters about 41 percent, with about 10 percent undecided.
As in Finland and Sweden, the heart of the opposition comes from rural villages and small coastal communities, whose residents fear that Brussels will make Norway roll back subsidies to farmers and open its rich fishing grounds to the rest of Europe. Among Norway's 4.3 million people, more than half are scattered in smaller communities outside the larger cities.
But the gap between the two sides in the election has been closing. With many previously undecided voters now supporting membership after the Swedes narrowly voted on Nov. 13 to join, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who favors joining, predicted this week that Norway would follow suit.
Other advocates of membership have stepped up their campaign, warning Norwegians that they will suffer if they reject the union, which will open borders between member nations and abolish barriers to the movement of goods and people.
"When the Japanese and the Americans make a decision about where to put a new European industrial facility, they are not going to put it in Norway, if Norway stays out of the union," Turid Birkeland, a member of Mrs. Bruntland's party, said in an address to retirees in Bergen. "The greatest changes will not come from joining Europe, but by staying out."
If Norway decides against membership, as advocates like Ms. Birkeland point out, it will join Switzerland, Lichtenstein and Iceland as the only Western European nations remaining outside the European Union.
Diplomats in Oslo say Norway's reluctance underscores a doggedly independent streak among Norwegians, who have turned down the European Union before, in a 1972 referendum.
"When people say we are turning our back on Europe, what do they mean?" demanded Vegard Velle, a 23-year-old student who is against the European Union. "I think the 49 percent of the French who last year voted against the E.U. treaty would be inspired by us."
For the 12 current members of the European Union, the Norwegian referendum is the last in a series of elections this year that have effectively redefined it. Assured of the addition of Sweden and Finland as well as Austria, which voted yes over the summer, the European Union has now increased both its size and its reach at a time when it is being asked to a play a larger and more active role in promoting security and prosperity on the European continent and beyond.
In shifting its geographic center both north and east, the European Union now has for the first time a common land border with Russia, and has set the stage for expansion that might next include the Czech Republic, Poland and even the Baltic states.
But in expanding, the European Union also risks political change within its own councils. Like Britain and Denmark, the only Scandinavian nation already a member, the new Nordic members are skeptical of the trend toward federalization and centralization favored by some in Brussels. They say they will press to open up the union's decision making to greater public scrutiny.
What remains unclear is whether Norway will become the 16th member of the European Union when it reconvenes on Jan. 1, 1995.
Among a group of retirees in Bergen, Louis Nagel, who is 76, said he would certainly vote yes.
"When I was young, we had soldiers on all the borders of Europe," Mr. Nagel said. "Now we have a chance to open them up forever."

HEADLINE: G. J. Feldman, 91, Ambassador And Leader in Space Effort, Dies

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
George J. Feldman, a former United States Ambassador to Luxembourg and Malta and a leading figure in the United States space effort, died Tuesday at the Bryn Mawr Terrace Nursing Home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He was 91.
A native of Boston, Mr. Feldman received his law degree from Boston University and later alternated between private law practice in Boston, Washington and New York and government service. Among his corporate clients, Mr. Feldman represented the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, better known as A.& P. 
 He was also an author of numerous articles and books on business law, including "Business Under the New Price Laws" (Prentice-Hall, 1937), a study of the economic problems arising from the passage of New Deal fair-trade legislation.
During the 1930's, he became an administrative assistant to Senator David L. Walsh, a Massachusetts Democrat, and later served as a lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission and the National Recovery Administration. During World War II, he joined the Air Force, eventually attaining the rank of major.
After the war, he was a consultant to the legal counsel of the Department of State, chief counsel to the House Select Committee on Astronautics and Outer Space and, in 1959, a member of the United States delegation to the 14th United Nations General Assembly.
That same year, the House majority leader, Representative John W. McCormack, Democrat of Massachusetts, appointed Mr. Feldman as chief counsel of the newly formed House Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration.
In that capacity, Mr. Feldman was a chief author of a study that recommended the establishment of a civilian space agency, later named the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to take on the assignment of overtaking the Soviet Union in space, rather than giving the job to the military.
In 1962, President John F. Kennedy named Mr. Feldman one of the original directors of the Communications Satellite Corporation, the world's first commercial venture in space, which had been established by Congress to create a system of communications satellites.
In 1960, Mr. Feldman served as vice chairman of the Democratic Party's finance committee and, four years later, he was an adviser to the party's platform committee.
From 1965 to 1967, after being appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, he served as the nation's first Ambassador to Malta. Then President Johnson named him Ambassador to Luxembourg.
In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford named Mr. Feldman a member of his Democrats for Ford Committee in his unsuccessful campaign against Jimmy Carter. Mr. Feldman, wearing a "Ford-ocrat' button, said at the time that he was "baffled by Mr. Carter."
Mr. Feldman is survived by a son, George, of Bryn Mawr; a daughter, Margot, of South Kent, Conn.; a brother, Cabot, of Washington;, two sisters, Rose Adler of Washington and Gennette Stargatt of Wilmington, Del., and a grandchild. His wife, Marion, died in 1982.

HEADLINE: Cost of Health Care in the United States Is Continuing to Grow

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The nation's health bill is still growing faster than the rest of the economy despite the third-lowest round of medical inflation in 33 years, Clinton Administration officials say.
The cost of health care for 1993 -- from aspirins to nursing homes to open-heart surgeries -- came to $884 billion, or $3,299 each for the 268 million residents of the United States and its territories. 
 The 7.8 percent increase was the smallest since 1986, when health expenditures rose 7.2 percent. The only smaller increase in recent decades was in 1961, when medical spending rose 7.1 percent.
In most years from the mid-1960's until the start of the 1990's, health expenditures climbed at double-digit rates. The increases slowed to under 9 percent in 1991 and 1992.
But Bruce C. Vladeck, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, said this week that it was too soon to consider high inflation for medical costs a thing of the past.
"It's not a real bad year, but it's right at the historical average," said Mr. Vladeck, who noted that health care claimed 13.9 percent of the gross domestic product, up from 13.6 percent in 1992.
Compared with overall inflation, which was about 3 percent for the 12 months ending in September, he said, "We're not doing that much better than in the past."
The health care total was lower than both the Health Care Financing Administration and the Commerce Department had estimated. It rose from $820 billion in 1992, when Americans spent $205 per capita less on their health.
President Clinton spent much of the past two years campaigning for sweeping changes in the health care system. Last year he and his wife, Hillary, contended that drug companies and insurance companies were profiteers.
While the Clinton proposal to overhaul the health care system failed to be considered by Congress, the health industry has been under heavy pressure to restrain prices. Many Americans now are in some form of managed care, and both the Government and private insurers have reduced what they pay hospitals and high-priced specialists.
Actuaries from the health financing agency, writing in the Health Care Financing Review, said: "It remains unclear whether the moderation in health spending growth is a temporary lull in the health care crisis spurred by the threat of government intervention or the beginning of a long-term restructuring of the private health care system, the full impact of which is only beginning to be seen in 1993."
The actuaries found that from 1990 to 1993:
*Growth in costs slowed in every personal health care category except dental services. The latter grew faster as "concerns over the spread of AIDS increased purchases of supplies" and pushed up prices.
*The increase in hospital expenditures slowed to 6.7 percent from 10.7 percent.
*The increase in doctor bills slowed to 5.8 percent from 10.3 percent.
*Inflation in retail drug purchases slowed to 6.8 percent from 14.5 percent. Americans bought $49 billion worth of prescription drugs and spent $26 billion on over-the-counter drugs and medical sundries in 1993.
*The Federal Government shouldered 32 percent of the nation's health bill, up from 28 percent.
Federal and state spending on Medicaid rose 9.2 percent in 1993, down from 15 percent in 1992 and almost 25 percent in 1991.

HEADLINE: FIGURE SKATING;
All of Those Triple Axels Are Leaving the Skating World Dizzy

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
With the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, figure skating has lost its innocence while experiencing unprecedented popularity, opportunity and chaos.
Ice wars have broken out this fall between so-called amateur or Olympic-style skating and professional skating, which features such familiar and accomplished stars as Kerrigan, Kristi Yamaguchi, Brian Boitano, Katarina Witt, Viktor Petrenko, Scott Hamilton and Paul Wylie. Promoters, television networks and big money have joined the fray. Even fans have become embroiled in a sideline skirmish. At stake is nothing less than control and legitimacy of the sport, the importance of the Winter Olympics and the direction of skating toward the future. 
 Gone are the days when elite skaters competed in the Winter Olympics, went on tour, joined the Ice Capades or coached and then faded gracefully into oblivion. Professional competitions have extended careers and hugely expanded earning power. On Nov. 19, Yamaguchi and Hamilton each won $200,000 for winning the prime-time Gold Championship, a competition among former Olympic champions in Edmonton, Alberta.
Earlier, Yamaguchi, Boitano, Kerrigan and Wylie each pocketed $100,000 -- plus appearance fees -- for the Ice Wars team competition, another prime-time event. Oksana Baiul, the reigning Olympic champion from Ukraine, has signed a contract reportedly worth $1.5 million with the promoter Michael Berg. Television ratings have been high, and so has the general level of skating. For the first time, fans are being treated to legitimate axel-to-axel duels between Olympic champions from the past decade.
 
Amateurs Are Still Unknown Quantity
 This explosion of professional skating comes at a time when amateur skating in the United States is stuck in a competitive recession and lacks the maturity or charisma of the former Olympic champions. Projections are that Michelle Kwan of Los Angeles will become a great skater, perhaps even an Olympic gold medalist, but she is only 14 years old. The other amateur skater causing a buzz, Tara Lipinski of Houston, is only 12.
"Like dancers and singers, skaters mature into artists in their late 20's and 30's," said Dick Button, the former Olympic champion who, along with Berg, is the most established promoter of professional competitions.
Brian Boitano, the 1988 Olympic champion said: "People want to see the skaters they know; people don't know the amateurs. I think the amateur world should be a little worried. This could become something like the professional tennis circuit."
A rare confluence of events has conspired to put figure skating -- consistently the most popular sport on TV outside of professional football -- in greater demand than ever.
First, under a one-time adjustment of the Olympic schedule, the Winter Games were held twice in two years -- 1992 and 1994 -- rather than once every four years. Second, Kerrigan was attacked by associates of her chief rival, Tonya Harding, who later pleaded guilty to hindering the police investigation. Third, CBS lost the rights to broadcast National Football League games to the Fox network and found itself with a yawning program vacancy on Sunday afternoons.
This fall, figure skating has popped up on television with the seeming frequency of "Cheers" reruns. Both CBS and NBC have aired prime-time professional competitions. ABC will follow suit with the United States championships for Olympic-eligible skaters in February. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, CBS will insert skating into its weekend programming as a football replacement.
Christmas season tours -- featuring Kerrigan with the singer Aaron Neville, Baiul skating "The Nutcracker" with Petrenko and Boitano, and Hamilton, Yamaguchi and Witt headlining a 48-city extravaganza called Stars on Ice -- are lined up, like jets on a runway, ready for takeoff.
"This was inexorable, like professional basketball or tennis, where you develop as a professional and the people learn your name and start to follow you," said Wylie, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist. "Eventually, the Olympics may not be the only game in town in terms of bringing people a certain level of notoriety. In tennis, you don't have to wait four years to try to win Wimbledon or a Grand Slam. How unrealistic is that for skating?"
 
A Revolving Door Of Eligibility
 If this dizzying expansion has meant money for skaters and promoters, ratings for the networks and viewing opportunity for fans, it has also resulted in a byzantine, contradictory and confusing jumble of rules and eligibility requirements. Skating guidelines change from one professional competition to the next. The distinction between amateur and professional skating has been impenetrably blurred. Eligibility for the Olympics is restored and rescinded in a revolving-door manner that the professionals consider arbitrary and capricious.
"I would say it's confusing," said Yamaguchi, the 1992 Olympic champion. "People saw Nancy and Oksana in the Olympics and all of a sudden they're competing against me, a professional. I don't know if people really understand. They ask, 'Does this mean anything for the Olympics? Does this qualify for anything?' Maybe over the years, skating will start being a little more structured."
Feeling most threatened by this burgeoning professionalism is the International Skating Union, the worldwide governing body for amateur skating. The union sanctions skaters for the Winter Olympics and the annual world championships. The United States Figure Skating Association is a member of the union, and its president, Claire Ferguson, sits on the union's 12-member executive committee.
Ferguson calls the professional competitions "bogus" because they lack uniform rules, sanctioned judges, drug testing and grievance procedures. Without these controls, she said, figure skating could lose its legitimacy as a sport and devolve into theater, as professional wrestling has done. The association is also upset because promoters are harvesting athletes cultivated by the amateur ranks without giving any money back to the sport.
"We have to be credible with the audience, and I'm afraid this is going to erode that credibility," Ferguson said of professional competitions. "It's like the blond guy holding the championship belt; everyone knows it's not real wrestling."
True, the professional circuit has suffered some dents to its credibility this season. A women's event hastily became a men's competition after Baiul underwent knee surgery in September. No individual scores were posted at the Ice Wars team competition, at least in part, skating insiders said, because Kerrigan wanted to avoid the possibility of losing publicly to Baiul as she had done at the 1994 Olympics. Baiul, meanwhile, has continued to skate the lucrative pro circuit, where she has struggled, while pulling out of an Olympic-style pro-am competition this week in Philadelphia.
Some members of a group called Skating Fans of America, which claims to represent a network of 12,000 fans nationwide, have protested that the Gold Championship on Nov. 19 appeared to be less a competition than a promotional device for the International Management Group, which sponsored the event. Wylie and Kurt Browning, both I.M.G. clients, served as commentators, while first place was awarded to I.M.G.-represented skaters, Yamaguchi and Hamilton, who will tour soon with the I.M.G.-sanctioned Stars on Ice. Hamilton won over the crowd but did not display the technical skill of Boitano or Petrenko.
"We feel used," said Elizabeth Luhn of Kennedyville, Md., president of Skating Fans of America.
Button, who promoted the Gold Championship with I.M.G., defended Hamilton's victory, saying, "There is more to skating than triple jumps." He said that he welcomed discussion about judging. In interviews, neither Boitano nor Petrenko complained about the judges, six of seven of whom were former Olympic medalists. Boitano said he preferred to be judged by one-time skaters "because they know what they are seeing."
Most fans, too, apparently like what they see. The Gold Championship drew a double-digit rating on NBC, as Ice Wars had done on CBS. The level of professional skating remains Olympic-caliber. Boitano, his knees pain-free, is performing at his finest level in two or three years. Yamaguchi is, by all accounts, again the top woman skater in the world. Even the amateurs admit to the professional virtuosity.
"I don't think the level of skating is any lower; artistically, it's even higher," said Todd Eldredge, a former national champion who will seek a second Olympic bid in 1998. "Obviously, though, they don't have the pressure of the Olympics and the world championships."
As professionals, skaters have more control over their careers than do amateurs. They can vary their routines, avoiding the monotony of an entire season preparing for the Olympics or the world championships. They can use music with vocals instead of strictly instrumental pieces, and they can employ more artistry in their performances, rather than remaining beholden to required or expected jumps and spins.
What the professionals want is "open" skating, meaning the right to choose entry in any event from the Olympics to a made-for-TV competition. As it stands, neither talent nor the acceptance of money alone determines Olympic eligibility.
There is no such thing as a true amateur skater anymore. Since 1990, amateur skaters have been able to earn money directly from competitions, tours and exhibitions and retain their Olympic eligibility. What qualifies a skater for the Olympics is simply whether he or she has competed in certain skating union-certified events and avoided certain unsanctioned professional competitions.
 
Pro to Olympics And Back Again
 Such is the tangled nature of the sport that skaters pass in and out of Olympic eligibility the way hemlines pass in and out of fashion. Boitano was the Olympic champion in 1988, a professional for five years, an Olympian in February 1994 and a professional again immediately after. Baiul is competing professionally this season but has until April 1, 1995, to restore her Olympic eligibility for 1998. The rules shift so quickly and inexplicably that Yamaguchi declared for Olympic reinstatement this year, wanting to explore her options as a pairs skater, only to find herself ineligible again a few months later.
"It doesn't make sense, why a person is professional one day, then reinstated as an amateur the next," Wylie said. "What's the difference? It seems arbitrary, bogus."
If change comes in the form of open competition, it is likely to be glacial. Even among its members, the conservative International Skating Union is known as a reactive, rather than pro-active, organization. It is dominated by Europeans, who have not historically found it urgent to respond to the needs of the United States. Half of its executive board, as well as its Italian president, come from the discipline of speed skating, not figure skating.
Unless it changes, the professionals said, the union faces irrelevance, the possible mass defection of Olympic-eligible skaters to the pro ranks and even the remote chance of losing its Olympic sanctioning.
Ferguson disagreed. She said she believed this professional threat was temporary, that it would fade once the current set of champions such as Boitano and Witt retired from competitive skating or once television audiences wearied of see essentially the same performances week after week.
"The money will dry up," Ferguson said. "They're all milking the same cash cow."
Top amateurs such as Eldredge of the United States and Elvis Stojko of Canada, the world champion and Olympic silver medalist, have indicated they will maintain their Olympic eligibility through 1998. Baiul is also expected to be reinstated as an Olympian.
"It's tough to look at all that money being thrown around and not get in on it," Eldredge said. "But they've all medaled at the Olympics and the worlds, and I haven't. I feel I can. For competitive people in this sport, the Olympics and world championships are where it's at. The rewards are the professional competitions that come afterward."
But if Eldredge seems certain about the direction of figure skating, his coach, Richard Callaghan, does not.
"If you find out," he said, "let me know."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Owners End Up on Opposite Ends of the Ice Over Solution to the Labor Dispute

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Howard Baldwin and Ed Snider operate National Hockey League teams in the state of Pennsylvania, but they are coming from different directions in terms of the current labor lockout.
The postponement of the season passed through Day 57 today as talks recessed with no solution in sight. They could resume as soon as Monday. In separate telephone interviews recently, Baldwin of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Snider of the Philadelphia Flyers discussed the labor stalemate. 
 Baldwin, who cautioned fellow owners about the consequences of a lockout in September, is among those favoring a quick solution.
"We want to be playing over the holidays," Baldwin said. "I feel very strongly we should play over the holidays, and I'll have a much different attitude if we don't." He needs the cash flow.
"A lot of owners aren't Molson or Viacom, with deep pockets," he said, referring to the brewery that owns the Montreal Canadiens and the entertainment corporation that currently owns the Rangers. "We all have credit lines in place that we have had to use. If any of the 26 teams tell you they are not, they are not telling the truth."
In contrast, Snider is among the hard-liners. He said he hasn't changed his stance as more than a quarter of the 84-game season has been lost. Players will probably need about two weeks of training camp before games begin, so, even if the collective bargaining agreement is reached next week, the earliest start would be mid-December.
"To go through what we've gone through and have nothing you can sink your teeth into, I don't care if we never play," Snider said. "I don't want to come out of a painful lockout and not have anything to show for it."
The concept of a luxury tax on high payrolls has been the most divisive issue. The union calls it a salary cap and resists it. But in order to obtain the owners' desired "drag" on salary inflation, the two sides are discussing several other methods.
One is a reform of arbitration procedures by which a player's wage is determined by a neutral party. Owners argue that, by comparing his salary to others with similar statistics or experience, a player sometimes gets more than he deserves and forces up the wages of others. They want a system of "nonbinding" arbitration, but the two sides haven't yet agreed on what would happen to a player if his team chooses not to abide by the decision of the arbitrator.
"As long as arbitration is in, we'll have a disaster on our hands," Snider said. "Arbitration is a major problem in this league. Something has got to happen with arbitration. Eliminate all arbitration, and I can live with that."
Another major hurdle is entry-level salary. Rookie wages began to inflate greatly after Snider's Flyers signed Eric Lindros for $3.5 million in 1992-93. The owners want to hold down rookie wages by "slotting" draft choices to certain ceilings, exclusive of performance bonuses. A first-round draft choice might be held to $2 million over three seasons, including his signing bonus. He could get extra money, depending on performance statistics.
The owners also want a tightening of free-agency options for younger players in exchange for greater freedom for veterans at age 28. But the owners are demanding the exclusion of a veteran "franchise player" from this freedom, and the union is balking at this restriction. After meetings Friday and this morning, management bargainers seemed subdued.
"There was a sense of anticipation on our side that we'd have two big days here," Harry Sinden, president and general manager of the Boston Bruins, said. "The fact that we didn't get anything done at all leaves you a little frustrated."
The two sides have met 6 times in 10 days. Negotiations became more intense after the "luxury tax" concept was removed, at least temporarily. The union has said that this payroll penalty is a deal breaker. Management still hopes to include it in the final package. One way being considered is to structure it in a way that it would begin at a payroll trigger point that is much higher than the current average level.
That way, the owners would have the tax as insurance against a continuation of the rapid increase in average salaries. It would also serve to save face for Commissioner Gary Bettman, who has pushed the tax concept as the centerpiece of his demands.
Not only do the players oppose the tax, they have also said they don't believe the owners' contentions that they are losing large sums of money.
Baldwin said he got that message when he recently met with some of his players.
"The thing that impressed me most is the distrust," Baldwin said. "If we have a mandate, it is that we must overcome this distrust." He said financial disclosure, at this point, "doesn't matter."
"It's almost too late," he said. "Who's kidding who? We've got to make a deal."

Increased Free Agents Will Come With Cap

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If major league clubs don't like the selection of pitchers currently available as free agents, they need only be patient. More are on the way.
When the owners, as expected, declare an impasse and implement their salary cap proposal, they will also eliminate salary arbitration, establish a salary scale for players in their first four years in the major leagues and create a new class of free agents -- players who have been in the majors at least four years but fewer than six. 
 Free agency for those players will not come easily. Their clubs will have the right of first refusal, meaning a club can retain a player by matching an offer from another club. With most of the best new free agents, offers from other clubs most likely only will drive up the price for their own clubs because their clubs will do what's necessary to keep them.
That's why they will be called restricted free agents, as opposed to the unrestricted, who are players with six or more years of major league service.
The best players in the four-to-six year category are signed to multiyear contracts: Frank Thomas, Ken Griffey Jr., Juan Gonzalez, John Olerud, Albert Belle, Robin Ventura, Travis Fryman, Gary Sheffield, David Justice and Randy Johnson. They won't be on the market.
But free agents in waiting include the starting pitchers Ben McDonald of Baltimore, Jack McDowell and Alex Fernandez of the Chicago White Sox, Kevin Appier and Tom Gordon of Kansas City, Scott Erickson and Kevin Tapani of Minnesota, Jim Abbott of the Yankees, Kenny Rogers of Texas, Steve Avery and Kent Mercker of Atlanta, Pete Harnisch of Houston, Ramon Martinez of Los Angeles, Ken Hill of Montreal and Andy Benes of San Diego.
Others include the reliever John Wetteland of Montreal; catcher Chris Hoiles of Baltimore; first baseman Hal Morris of Cincinnati; second baseman Delino DeShields of Los Angeles; shortstops Omar Vizquel of Cleveland and Jose Vizcaino of the Mets; third basemen Dave Hollins of Philadelphia, Jeff King of Pittsburgh and Todd Zeile of St. Louis, and outfielders Brian McRae of Kansas City, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, Dante Bichette of Colorado, Marquis Grissom of Montreal and Ray Lankford of St. Louis.
Because the system will start late this year, the free agency dates will differ from those in the clubs' proposal. But if the impasse and implementation survive the union's challenge to the National Labor Relations Board, the system in future years will call for all eligible players to become restricted free agents Nov. 1 or three days after the World Series, whichever is later, and have a signing season that ends Feb. 1.
To reserve its right-of-first-refusal right, a club will have to tender a qualifying offer to the free agent for a nonguaranteed salary at least 10 percent higher than the previous season's earnings.
If a player receives an offer sheet -- he can sign only one offer sheet at a time -- it is presented to his former club, which then has 10 days to exercise its right of first refusal.
Under the proposed rules, one club cannot make a deal with another club in exchange for that club's decision to exercise or not exercise its right of first refusal. Nor can a club assign the right of first refusal to another club.
The rules also place restrictions on what a new team can offer a free agent. No property or investment opportunity, for example, can be offered. Nor can a team offer incentives based on a player's performance at a particular position. Attendance bonuses, too, will be prohibited.
But the clubs will not try to bar the new free agents from seeking employment in another league.
"There shall be no restriction or interference with the right of a restricted free agent to negotiate or contract with any baseball club outside the structure of organized baseball," the pending rules state.
 
Change in Free Agent Rules
 When free agency began 18 years ago, clubs drafted rights to players who had filed for free agency. First the draft disappeared, and now the filing period will follow it.
Under the rules the clubs will implement, eligible players no longer will have to file to become free agents. Both the new class of free agents and the old will become free instantly, either on Nov. 1 of each year or three days after the end of the World Series, whichever is later.
On the surface, the clubs seem to be simplifying the procedure, but that's not the reason for the change. The owners have two reasons for making all eligible players free agents automatically:
1. When players are free agents, their salaries are no longer protected by the maximum cut rule (20 percent over one year, 30 percent over two years). Some players have chosen to avoid a greater salary slash by opting to remain with their clubs. Under the new system, they won't have a choice.
2. Players won't be able to pass up the elective type of free agency and wait to become free when their teams don't tender them a contract. Players sometimes have used that strategy to free themselves of the bargaining burden of compensation, which doesn't apply in nontender circumstances.
 
Metrodome Frightens Pitchers
 Not that the Minnesota Twins would scour the free-agent list for the pitching they desperately need; they don't spend the kind of money needed to overhaul the staff whose 5.68 earned run average was the worst in the major leagues last season. But even if they wanted to, the Twins don't think they could lure the best pitchers available.
"It's very difficult to attract a pitcher to the Metrodome," General Manager Terry Ryan said.
 
Trebelhorn Tries Western Look
 After managing the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago Cubs, Tom Trebelhorn is about to manage the Tri-City Posse. That's one of eight teams that will form the independent Western League next year. Creating independent minor leagues has become the thing to do in baseball.
"What we're seeing is baseball going back more and more to independent teams," Trebelhorn said. "I see the strike as being a way for organizations to cut back on player development budgets, cutting scouting, instructors, managers and coaches. I think there's a void that independent baseball can fill."
Trebelhorn, who was let go as the Cubs' manager by the new general manager, Ed Lynch, said he was considering several opportunities -- in the minor leagues and in Australian baseball -- when the Tri-City owners called.
"They read an article that said I was entertaining anything and everything," Trebelhorn related. "They explained the league to me and said the job would be far more than field manager. I'll be involved in player procurement and putting the whole thing together. This is something I have never done before. It seemed intriguing."
The league has four teams in California, including Palm Springs and Long Beach, and four in the Pacific Northwest, including one in British Columbia. Stocked with 6 veterans, 6 rookies and 12 limited-service players, each team will play 90 games. Trebelhorn said the league probably would fit into a high Class A and AA levels of minor league baseball.
The league's other managers include Jeff Burroughs, Al Gallagher, Nate Colbert and Bill Sudakis, all former major league players but not, like Trebelhorn, former major league managers.
 
Buying Into Signing Bonuses
 Less than two weeks after their labor lawyers cautioned the clubs about giving players signing bonuses that would "help fund the continuing players strike," the Yankees gave Paul O'Neill a $2.2 million signing bonus, $1.2 million of it payable Dec. 15. Although the Yankees believed they had to do it to keep O'Neill from free agency, they were criticized nonetheless.
Since the strike began, only three other players have signed contracts with signing bonuses included, all since the O'Neill signing: Dan Plesac with Pittsburgh, $200,000; Jose Mesa with Cleveland, $50,000, and Jeff Bagwell with Houston, $3.5 million.
Plesac and Mesa will receive their signing bonuses upon ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement (it could be like Civil War money by then). Bagwell, whose bonus is being deferred with interest to maintain its value, will receive his $3.5 million if he is traded, if any of the three option years in the contract are not exercised or when the contract is terminated.
 
Astronomical Implications
 In signing Bagwell, the Astros provided the latest example of why the owners want the players to protect them from themselves. Claude Brochu, Montreal's managing partner, quickly criticized Drayton McLane Jr., the Houston owner, for the size of the signing, $27.5 million for four years.
"What concerns me is that when that kind of money is offered, it becomes the benchmark for players in that category," Brochu said in remarks to McGill University law students. "That, in my estimation, is a mistake by my friend Drayton McLane. It's his mistake, but now it becomes my problem, and that's not a fair economic system in my opinion."
The Astros, however, did what they felt they had to do to tie up Bagwell, the cornerstone of their franchise. Every team can't be expected to play on the Expos' penurious level. Teams like the Expos, on the other hand, have three alternatives: find wealthier owners, market their team better to attract more fans and revenue or move to a city that can support them.

HEADLINE: Coming Fiercely to the Defense of Social Security

 BODY:
A Post Office poster of the 30's, promoting the new Social Security system.
The Market Watch column on Nov. 6, "Social Security: The Issue They Chose to Ignore," drew a large, angry response from many readers. A sampling follows:
 
To the Editor: 
 It is indeed discouraging to see Floyd Norris blithely accepting political propaganda as a substitute for economic fact. He seems to think that reducing Social Security benefits will reduce the Federal deficit. Yet, the evidence is clear that Social Security is not adding one penny to the deficit and that reducing benefits will not reduce the deficit. As Senator Daniel P. Moynihan points out, Social Security will have a $60 billion surplus this year, a $70 billion surplus next year and a $100 billion surplus by 1999. All this excess revenue is invested in United States Treasury bonds and helps finance the deficit, not increase it. If, as Mr. Norris says, "many doubt Social Security will remain," writers like Mr. Norris share the blame with politicians who oppose Social Security in creating unjustified pessimism.

The Market Watch column on Nov. 6, "Social Security: The Issue They Chose to Ignore," drew a large, angry response from many readers. A sampling follows:
 
To the Editor: 
 Floyd Norris contributed substantially to my own gloom and despair by suggesting that market forces could solve the health care problem in this country. Health care is a social and political issue: there is no good evidence that market forces do anything but contribute to the problem. We have tried market forces and they failed in this area where few market driven conditions exist.
Mr. Norris depresses me further by stating that Social Security is not a pension plan. Although there is a safety net for the disabled and those at the bottom of the wage scale, a high percentage of people receive from Social Security according to the contributions made, provided they have worked and contributed for a long enough period. This certainly sounds like most of the pension plans I am familiar with.
The real problems with Social Security began in the Johnson administration when it was included in the annual Federal discretionary budget in order to conceal the cost of the Vietnam War. The problem was greatly exacerbated with the pillaging of Social Security funds in the Reagan-Bush years to hide the extent of the budget deficits and to pay for extraordinary military expenses and incredible stupid economic policies based on the belief that not levying taxes to pay for what one spends will somehow magically bring in more tax money.
Social Security is a well-funded program. Social Security money is "passed through" to pay for our national debt. As such it ought to be paid the going rate for long-term treasury bonds. If I calculate the accumulated amount I have contributed between 1950 and 1993 at the average annual long-term bond rate, less the amount I will withdraw with an annual 4 percent COLA, I will be 91 before I have exhausted my own monies. The calculation is similar for my wife (who collects considerably less than I do) based only on her contributions. Given that the life expectancy of American males and females is 72 and 79 years, respectively, there ought to be a lot of money available to pay for most of the unfunded things done with Social Security money.
It seems to me that the real solution is to raise taxes progressively, specifically to pay off the national debt as fast as possible. After that all the entitlement payments will be a piece of cake, as long as we don't continue to lie to our ignorant, greedy and gullible electorate, having them believe that they can have high military expenditures, subsidies of various forms, health insurance, etc., without paying for it.

 BODY:
A Post Office poster of the 30's, promoting the new Social Security system.
The Market Watch column on Nov. 6, "Social Security: The Issue They Chose to Ignore," drew a large, angry response from many readers. A sampling follows:
 
To the Editor: 
 After reading the "Market Watch" on Social Security, I am more convinced than ever that the media is engaged in a concerted effort to discredit the Social Security System and create a conflict between the young and the elderly. To its discredit, The New York Times has now joined in.
"Entitlements" has become a dirty word only because some in Congress and the media have attempted to corrupt its true meaning -- something to which one who has grounds lays claim. In that context, those who have contributed to the Social Security System, the Federal Employee Retirement System and the Railroad Retirement System have a legitimate right to the pensions they have been promised. Contrary to the views of the author of the column, attacking the above "entitlements" will not reduce the deficit by one penny. To the contrary, were it not for the surplus these systems run up each year, the deficit would be larger.
As an example, the annual Social Security surplus appears as an offset to the deficit in the Federal Budget, thereby masking the true deficit. In addition, those annual surplus by reason of legislation created by Congress, must be invested in special United States Government bonds, the interest on which is paid through the issuance of additional bonds.
This flim-flam created by Congress enables those who desire to confuse the public to claim that Social Security is close to running out of money. The truth of the matter is that the billions of dollars in bonds held by the Social Security Trust Fund constitute a reserve that will be available for many years. One day, these special bonds, which are a part of our total national debt must be paid off as will all other Federal instruments of debt sold to banks and the public.
Your column also attempts to discredit the system by implying that Social Security was never intended to be a pension plan, but a transfer program, by taking money from working people and giving it to the retired and the disabled. History shows that the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (Social Security) was designed as a pension system at a time when few if any employers provided pensions for their employees. Were it not for that system, many who receive Social Security today would be without funds and on welfare, or looking to their families for support.
Contrary to the views of the author of the column, those who contribute to the system have a right to receive payments and should not suffer the indignity of being portrayed as taking money from other working people. As for the doubt that the system will be there for those working today, that is an old saw that has been around since the inception of Social Security which is trotted out whenever the attempt is made to frighten the working class.
To believe that will happen, one has to believe that the United States Government will default on all of its debt obligations. Were that to happen, our entire economic system would collapse and the result would be anarchy. While many of those in Congress are not rocket scientists, it is unlikely they would stand by and let that happen since an event of that sort would cause them to suffer along with the rest of us for a change.

HEADLINE: The False Promise of Competition

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Now, It's the Rick Scott Health Plan" (Oct. 30) includes evidence usually overlooked by policy makers and the media -- your writer included -- especially with regard to the myth that competition drives down costs and prices. 
 Ira Magaziner, a senior health adviser to President Clinton, argues that competition among providers will reduce costs. Yet study after study has shown that too much construction of hospitals, the duplication of expensive high-tech equipment and the administrative spending providers incur in fighting with physicians combine to demonstrate that competition drastically increases costs. Having committed itself to a theory before studying the industry, the Clinton Administration remains trapped in a cobweb of confusion.
While contending that he does not seek monopoly status, Mr. Scott of Columbia/H.C.A. provides contrary evidence. His hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., is "stealing patients" from another hospital, and his 14 hospitals and six surgery centers in and around Tampa, Fla., have left tax-supported Tampa General on the verge of disaster. Obviously, the cost of all this competition in the Tampa Bay area is much greater than health needs require.
Logically, competition-duplication should be reduced, not expanded, and health care ultimately must become something of a public utility. The near-term danger is that as Mr. Scott and his competitors expand, they must underbid each other to win contracts and, perhaps, offer services they cannot deliver as promised, thereby causing government to intervene, as a matter of public interest, to insure the availability of health care and medical training. It will not matter whether the facilities are operated by private or public organizations.

HEADLINE: An Embassy Job in Moscow Would Make Any American Testy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 We served at the United States Embassy in Moscow from 1988 to 1992 and believe that your Nov. 18 article about it reflects misunderstanding of embassies. 
 You refer to the Embassy as a single entity, when it is made up of representatives of various United States agencies that have responsibility for distinctive areas of policy.
 For example, American business people should direct complaints about support for their activities to the Commerce Department, which maintains a commercial office in Moscow away from the Embassy compound. Responsibility for reviewing visa applications is shared by the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which have staffers working in Moscow. Many other agencies are represented.
 The Embassy does not set policy. Policies are set by the parent agencies in Washington, which send directions to their representatives in Moscow. State Department officers, who make up the political and economic officers at the Embassy among other sections, are primarily there to present United States policy to their Russian counterparts and be the eyes and ears of Washington. Frequently pulled into support for a parade of official visitors, they barely have time for their primary functions, much less to assist United States business people.
 You also leave an impression that all Americans at the Embassy live in a modern, fully equipped compound. Many live and work, as we did, in that small, enclosed space. Many others live in housing scattered through the city or in less than comfortable, or safe, hotel rooms. They rely for basic necessities on the facilities in the compound, which are supported by American taxpayers. The facilities were heavily strained when we were there, and it is not surprising that access has been limited to the expanding number of Embassy employees and families.
 As for complaints of rudeness: Visa application officials review hundreds of these a day. They often work much more than a 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. shift and then go home to a city apartment or hotel room. They are recognized on the street by visa applicants and harassed. They have all the problems of living in an overcrowded city like New York, plus the problems of finding decent food, coping with undrinkable water and doing without some basic services we take for granted. I would challenge any American to face these conditions and not get a bit testy from time to time.

'Old Sparky': It's Not Just A Punch Line

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
AT a time when David Letterman gets a pretty good laugh with references to the expected return of "Old Sparky," New York State's electric chair, Bob Gangi is not amused. He quoted Churchill: "The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilization of any country."
If so, then the public temper of our civilization is clearly for more of Old Sparky. And Mr. Gangi, as executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, one of the nation's earliest do-good watchdog organizations, can only groan in the minority with his risque insistence that felons are human, whatever problems of disposal they present to law abiders. Mr. Gangi talks of "the ignorance of history and the thirst for retribution" ruining all attempts at political debate about crime and punishment in America. 
 "We have seen the 'get tough on crime' phenomenon before," he said, looking back across 150 years of the association's history, recently to the Roaring 20's, when Speed Graphic portrayals of an uncontrollable crime wave of mad-dog felons fairly begged Old Sparky denouements, if only in the interests of popular entertainment.
"THERE are few areas where the public is more misinformed," Mr. Gangi contended. In the recent elections, he notes, candidates across the spectrum once again judged the nation "soft on crime," even though crime rates were declining and government already was underwriting the greatest nontotalitarian prison construction binge in history.
"Shameless politics," Mr. Gangi said. The way others smile at Old Sparky jokes, he smiles in amazement at how boom follows upon boom in the prison industry, recession-proof in the candidates' hands. In the last two decades, the state prison population in New York quintupled to 66,000 inmates as the Legislature, facing the voters every two years, promised crackdowns, mandated sentences in detail and crimped judges' discretion. Even so, the proportion of prisoners sentenced for violent crimes declined from 60 percent to 35 percent because, Mr. Gangi noted, it's easier for the police to bolster arrest statistics with drug abusers than with violent thugs.
An inmate now costs $59,000 per year, with more to come under a newly elected state government promising longer sentences, slower paroles and a taste of Old Sparky. "I thought the pendulum would begin coming back," Mr. Gangi said, speaking of the association's history of reform following crackdown. "But it's crashed through the side of its casing and is swinging wildly upward."
ON Dec. 5, the correctional association will celebrate its founding in 1844, a time when the highborn of society and the leaders of industry could indulge noblesse oblige ideals and debate prison reform without fear of attack commercials. Looking back, there was surprising public support for the association's being the first independent monitor to win authority to enter the prisons from a State Legislature remarkably fearless about being demagogued on the issue.
Initially, association volunteers visited Sing Sing and documented scandalous lashings of inmates, cold bath immersions and iron yokes. Critics quickly coined the term "coddlers" for those reformers and attempted to rescind their powers. This failed, as did the attempt 20 years ago when a crackdown mood arose after the 1971 Attica prison uprising in which 39 inmates and hostages were slain by authorities reseizing the prison.
On the association's anniversary, members are the first to note great progress beyond the 19th century, when wardens sold entertainment tickets for visitors to watch men and women behind bars and the courts prodded the state to release hundreds of inmates kept beyond their sentences. There were no paroles or Miranda appeals, and crime witnesses could be held along with the accused as a court convenience. People debated the two kinds of prisons: "silent," in which convicts were grouped in monkish, speechless obedience, and "separate," where each inmate was locked in solitude, a method that is back as the latest innovation in overwhelmed modern prisons.
Mr. Gangi celebrates the association's progressive history and hope with no apology for noblesse oblige ideals like rehabilitation. He begs politicians to question whether the $59,000 per prisoner might be spent earlier and more creatively on the same underclass that society is nurturing behind bars. He begs law abiders for something more than amusement at the return of Old Sparky.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
A Family Intact, a Promise Fulfilled

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
In Rebecca Anderson's corner of the South Bronx, families are fragile in the face of poverty and crime. But despite illness and need, Mrs. Anderson has fulfilled a promise to keep her family intact.
 Just before Mrs. Anderson's mother died in 1983, she begged her oldest daughter to watch over their growing family. Now, 30 years after her only child was born, Mrs. Anderson is a full-time mother again. At 54, she shares her cramped apartment with five nieces and nephews who otherwise would be in foster homes. 
Mrs. Anderson took in Zihrah, 18, and Cameca, 16, after their mothers died of heart disease in the 1980's. The girls have lived with Mrs. Anderson ever since, and they look to her as a parent and confidante. In 1991 she took custody of a great-niece, Mimi Smith, now 3, whose mentally disabled mother could not keep her.
 Last month brought two unexpected additions to the family: Mrs. Anderson's nephews Calvin, 1, and Omar, 8 weeks. Both were frail and underweight when they arrived, and Calvin has not learned to chew because his mother fed him only strained baby food. About her, Mrs. Anderson would only say, "We don't keep in touch."
 "There are so many children in the foster system, floating from home to home and being mistreated," she said last week, standing near a steel-barred window in her apartment in the Melrose section of the Bronx. "I couldn't let that happen to these kids."
 The cost of Mrs. Anderson's generosity has been steep. Her husband, Alton Anderson, does not live with the family, and she has sole responsibility for the children's welfare. She has lupus, a potentially life-threatening disease that causes arthritis, high blood pressure and painful skin lesions. After two operations this spring, Mrs. Anderson was overwhelmed by the burdens of second motherhood. She became exhausted, and she stopped cooking and cleaning.
 "If I tried to do housework I would get tremendous pains in my hands," she said. "The girls had jobs and lots of homework, so they couldn't help much. I honestly didn't believe I could keep it up."
 But thanks to a program run by the Children's Aid Society, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Mrs. Anderson was able to keep her nieces and take on her infant nephews.
 Like Mrs. Anderson, these charities are struggling to supplant misery with hope. Today, the fund begins its 83d annual appeal for contributions to help thousands of poor and sick New Yorkers.
 This year, private charities are financing a disproportionate share of social service programs because of state and city budget cuts. Even though the recession is finally ending, donations aren't keeping pace with the demand for services.
 Charity officials also say that indifference toward the poor is more widespread than ever.
 "There's no sense of alarm about what's happening to the most vulnerable people in our city," said Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president of the UJA-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, which receives help from the Neediest Cases Fund. "There's a general acceptance of government cuts, but nobody realizes the devastating effect they will have on the poor."
 As in recent years, charities are trying to aid growing numbers of newly unemployed New Yorkers while also caring for the chronically poor. They say they are especially worried about children and the elderly, who are the most likely to live in poverty.
 In 1992, the latest year for which statistics are available, nearly 20 percent of elderly New Yorkers lived below the poverty level. While 13,500 elderly New Yorkers receive government-subsidized, home-delivered meals, an additional 1,000 are on a waiting list, according to the city's Department for the Aging.
 Meanwhile, 38.5 percent of New York children were poor in 1992, and many of them did not receive public assistance. Charity officials say the need to increase day care and child abuse prevention programs is urgent. They also need to help growing numbers of older women like Mrs. Anderson, who take in relatives' children because of family problems.
 The Neediest Cases Fund dates to Christmas Day 1911, when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times, met a man who asked for money and a place to sleep. Mr. Ochs gave him several dollars and a job.
 The encounter inspired Mr. Ochs to have a reporter write about the city's 100 neediest cases in the winter of 1912. That year, 117 contributors gave $3,630.88. Last year, nearly 13,500 people donated $4,590,568.69, the second-highest amount in the campaign's history.
 The Times Foundation pays the costs of running the appeal, so all contributions are given directly to the seven charities. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.
 For Mrs. Anderson, relief came when her doctor put her in touch with the Children's Aid Society. The society provided her with a professional homemaker who spends five days a week in the apartment, helping with housekeeping, errands and child care.
 "This was an overwhelmed aunt who wanted to do the right thing but took on more than she could handle," said Mary Hutson, director of the Children's Aid Society's homemaker program. "Now she has the support of a trained professional who can help maintain a level of normalcy in the household."
 Cathy Tillman, the homemaker, became even more invaluable when Mrs. Anderson's nephews came along. She takes Calvin for walks in a stroller, cradles Omar in her lap for hours and gives Mrs. Anderson tips about infant care, something she hadn't thought about in years.
 "I don't even know the word for what I feel about her," Mrs. Anderson said, touching Mrs. Tillman's arm. "I am simply happy to have her help."
 The halls of the Andersons' apartment building are grimy and dark, and the smell of garbage hangs in the air. But inside their homes, constant chatter and activity create a protective barrier. One rainy night last week, Mimi toddled around with a tattered copy of "Peter and the Wolf" as Cameca talked about her coming school trip to Washington. While Mrs. Tillman rocked Omar, Zihrah danced Calvin around the toy-strewn living room. As television cartoons buzzed in the background, Mrs. Anderson talked about the serenity she felt when children were around.
 "Kids mean everything to me," she said. "If I had to do it again, I'd make the same choices. People ask me how I get my peace and quiet, but I would be lonely without them."
 Clearly, though, life could be easier. Money is scarce, and Mrs. Anderson can barely afford to feed her family, let alone buy them shoes and jackets. She lost most of her possessions in a fire three years ago, and is slowly accumulating new furniture. She never knows what effect her illness will have from day to day.
 "I try not to plan ahead and I don't like promises, because they can hurt a lot," she said. "We just take one day at a time, and with the Lord's help we're doing fine." NEXT SUNDAY: Poverty's growing toll on elderly New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: 2 Days From Pilgrims to Maccabees;
Jews Do a Lot of Celebrating in a Season of Multiple Holidays

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Somewhere between the time she popped her turkey in the oven and the time she wiped the crumbs off the table, Suzanne Farber managed to whip up a few latkes and freeze them.
"It's annoying," she said. "But you do it." 
 Many Jews found themselves squeezed last week. Between Thanksgiving and Hanukkah, which begins tonight -- the first time the two holidays have fallen so close together since 1918 -- there were only two days to make the transition from cooking and eating to cooking and eating, with candles.
There have been Hanukkah parties to plan. There have been presents to buy. And there have been parking places to find at that pit of fire and brimstone, the mall -- all on Thanksgiving weekend.
Some people have proclaimed this a good thing.
"This is much better than being mixed up with Christmas," said Richard Hyfler, who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "We get a jump on all the shopping and have no problem getting what we want."
In fact, there are other reasons people find the juxtaposition pleasing.
For one thing, it gives a year's hiatus to the often unintentional linking of Hanukkah to Christmas, which many say has always undermined the fact that the two celebrations have nothing to do with each other.
Hanukkah celebrates the victory 2,000 years ago of the Jewish Maccabees in their battle to regain Jerusalem from the Syrians. The menorah used to cast light as they rebuilt the temple there had only enough oil to burn for one night but instead lasted for eight; hence the lighting of the menorah today. Latkes, applesauce and parties with booty are modern additions.
Jews have often complained that a perfectly nice little miracle, albeit one not even mentioned in the Old Testament, should not be compared with the Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus.
They argue that the two are usually folded together largely as an accommodation, with menorahs in holiday store-window displays and songs that give a nod to Hanukkah traditions in elementary-school pageants.
This year Hanukkah shares the limelight with a different kind of holiday, when a fruitful landing in New England by European settlers in the 1600's is commemorated with overindulgence and good cheer. In fact, some Jews do not celebrate Thanksgiving at all because it is a secular holiday.
But Shira Dicker, a columnist for several Jewish weeklies, believes that in fact Thanksgiving and Hanukkah are close in spirit. "Hanukkah is a festival of lights," she said. "The gratitude that is awakened during Thanksgiving serves as a catalyst for us to put light in other people's lives."
Because Thanksgiving and the beginning of Hanukkah fall on the same weekend this year, families who might not otherwise be together have gathered to celebrate both holidays. Every 10 years or so, Hanukkah falls in early December, but very rarely -- only once or twice a century -- does it overlap with Thanksgiving weekend.
"It fits in perfectly," said Rabbi Judith Lewis of Temple Israel in Manhattan. "On Thanksgiving the family is together anyway, so they get a chance to light candles together."
(On the flip side, those who find family gatherings only slightly less stressful than, for instance, angioplasty can get two for one without feeling guilty about their lunar luck.)
Even retailers, who over the last few years have only been able to gripe and groan about the economy, are cheerful. They got a few extra days of gift-buying out of the bargain, they reason, and can better accommodate early shoppers.
"When the two were close before, I think about seven years ago, it was very good for us," said Joseph Siegel, the vice president of retail services for the National Retail Federation in New York.
"You get a buying pattern that starts a lot earlier, and it gives us an even flow. When people have time, they will buy 12 items; when they don't, they'll settle for eight. Then we'll be out of what they wanted anyway, so they'll just give money instead."
Sylvia Weiser got one such jump on the masses by doing all her shopping early last month. 'It puts a little pressure on you," Mrs. Weiser said. "But I learned that I just had to do it all early."
By the time her entire family gathered together in her home in Manhasset Hills, L.I., for turkey and stuffing, all the Hanukkah gifts were wrapped and ready. 'I have to wrap right away," she said. "Everyone in this house cheats."
Saul Zabar, an owner of Zabar's, said there were even some favorable gastronomic implications.
"I talked to some of my religious customers," he said on Wednesday. "I asked them, 'What are you going to do different this year, guys?' They told me, 'We're going to eat our regular thing on Thanksgiving, our regular thing on Hanukkah, and if there is any cranberry sauce left, we will put it on our latkes.' "
Ah, the adaptable American palate.
There is truth, there is light and then there is convenience. And so an early Hanukkah is beloved by many, if for no other reason than it seems to fit well into the Filofax.
Richard Kahn, a part-time student and part-time research assistant, is squeezing in a Hanukkah party between Thanksgiving, work and his final exams. "This is great for party-planning because when Hanukkah is close to Christmas, people have a much busier party schedule," he said.
So everybody who is anybody in his world will show up at Mr. Kahn's apartment in Washington Heights next weekend. But his wife, Robin Gillespi, sees another silver lining. They are an interfaith couple, and so, "this way, you can get presents all month long," she said
A final thought: it's better not to marvel aloud that Hanukkah "came early" this year. It annoys the people who already feel bullied by the solar calendar.
"Hanukkah is never early, and it's never late," insisted Rabbi James Rudin, the director of inter-religious affairs at the American Jewish Committee. "Jews and Muslims use the lunar calendar, and so the holiday always falls on the 25th day of Kislev. That's that."
 A picture caption on Nov. 28 about Hanukkah misstated part of the traditional account of the holiday's origin. According to tradition, the menorah oil used by the Jews as they rebuilt the temple in Jerusalem lasted for eight nights though it was only enough for one night; the story does not say it was just one drop.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 13, 1994, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 27 about preparations for Thanksgiving and Hanukkah overstated the rarity of the holidays' occurring so close together. Since 1896, there have been 10 instances when the two holidays came as close together as they did this year; in 9 of those, Hanukkah overlapped the Thanksgiving weekend.

D. H. LAWRENCE
The Story of a Marriage.
By Brenda Maddox.
Illustrated. 620 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $30. 
 WAS D. H. Lawrence homosexual? His fiction abounds with overheated evocations of male beauty and male bonding; his men love to give each other rubdowns, as George and Cyril do in "The White Peacock" (1911), or wrestle naked on the library carpet, as Rupert and Gerald do in "Women in Love" (1920). At the end of that novel, Rupert has won Ursula, with whom he looks forward to a perfect marriage. But he has lost Gerald, which leaves him unsatisfied.
"I wanted eternal union with a man too: another kind of love," he tells Ursula. Despite her high tolerance for Lawrentian rhetoric, she balks at this: "You can't have two kinds of love," she declares.
"It seems as if I can't," he said. "Yet I wanted it."
"You can't have it, because it's wrong, impossible," she said.
"I don't believe that," he answered.
"Women in Love" ends on this oddly querulous note, as if Lawrence were annoyed at himself for failing to settle the matter.
The issue of Lawrence's homosexuality haunts Brenda Maddox's "D. H. Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage," and in the end she never quite settles it either. If David Herbert Lawrence (1885-1930) had sex with a man, she tells us, he had it only once, with a Cornish farmer. But Lawrence's homosexuality may have been of the repressed variety, which can turn nasty. He often found himself powerfully attracted to other men, from whom he violently recoiled. He could also be a virulent misogynist, both in fiction and in life; his hatred of women may have expressed fear of the feminine in himself.
But Lawrence loved women too; his fiction also abounds with extravagant praise of womanhood and the eternal union of two sexes. There is no grander paean to carnal heterosexuality than "Lady Chatterley's Lover" (1928), which crowned Lawrence's career, although the unexpurgated version wasn't sold publicly until 30 years after his death.
Besides, in 1912 Lawrence ran away with one of literary history's most womanly women, the formidable Frieda Weekley (1879-1956), nee von Richthofen, who got him into bed 20 minutes after meeting him, and who left her husband and children for Lawrence. From their marriage in 1914 until Lawrence's death from tuberculosis in 1930, they loved and warred across four continents, usually with violence and often in public. Lawrence was, as Ms. Maddox says, "above all -- as he saw himself -- a married man."
Ms. Maddox's title, "D. H. Lawrence," and her subtitle, "The Story of a Marriage," make a strange pair -- almost as strange as Lawrence and Frieda. This is not, however, a dual biography, nor is it an attempt to rescue the forgotten partner, as Ms. Maddox did with Mrs. James Joyce in "Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom." Except for two chapters, Lawrence stands always at the center of "D. H. Lawrence." The 26 years Frieda lived after his death are summarized in as many pages.
But Ms. Maddox also hasn't written a full-fledged biography of Lawrence. Though she often seeks to explain his odd adult behavior in terms of childhood influences, she spends very little time on his actual childhood and next to none on his parents. For Ms. Maddox's purposes, Lawrence's life properly began when he was 26, the day Frieda pounced. "He never had a chance," Ms. Maddox quips. But she shows clearly that he wouldn't have wanted one.
For the next 18 years, Lawrence remained, except for two brief lapses, utterly faithful to Frieda. She, meanwhile, pursued her cheerfully promiscuous way, bestowing her favors as freely on other men as she had on him. By 1926, she had taken up with Lieut. Angelo Ravagli, an Italian infantry officer, with whom she consorted intermittently throughout Lawrence's last years and whom she married in 1950. Lawrence knew all about Frieda's peccadilloes and more or less tolerated them, though he exacted a sort of revenge by treating her horribly at every opportunity.
Throughout their marriage, he flailed at her physically; his tubercular frailness, however, prevented him from doing much harm to the robust Frieda. His verbal abuse was unstinting: "you sniffing bitch!" counts among his gentler salutations. But that, too, seems to have left no scars. Frieda could give as good as she got -- less cleverly than the famous writer but with appropriate effect -- and she was not above hurling a few dishes at his head. Time and time again, Ms. Maddox tells us, their friends (in whose company these battles often took place) believed that the marriage had to be at an end, but hostility seems only to have reinforced it. Half an hour after an especially savage clash, Katherine Mansfield was astonished to encounter Lawrence and Frieda strolling amiably arm in arm, discussing macaroni and cheese.
APPALLING though the Lawrences' behavior must have been to witness, in Ms. Maddox's able hands it makes highly amusing reading. She tracks Lawrence and Frieda around the globe and in and out of innumerable friendships with the famous and nearly so. She also accounts provocatively for the unflagging stream of novels, stories and nonfiction that Lawrence managed to crank out between bouts with illness and with Frieda.
Some of Ms. Maddox's attempts to link Lawrence's fiction with his life are a bit overingenious, and she turns several handsprings attempting to refute the charge of misogyny that feminists have leveled against him. Despite dozens of valiant attempts, she does not succeed in accounting for the bizarreries of Lawrentian sexuality; indeed, she left this reader wondering what was supposed to be so compelling about that distinctly unappetizing subject. On the whole, however, "D. H. Lawrence" is a pleasure. It is a thoroughly absorbing, satisfying treatment of Lawrence's life, his work and his mysterious marriage.
 
 
 
A BALANCE OF EXTREMES
 Five years ago, Brenda Maddox's publisher suggested she write a biography of D. H. Lawrence. "I said, 'Anybody but Lawrence!' " recalled Ms. Maddox, whose "D. H. Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage" received Britain's Whitbread Award for biography earlier this month. "I'd never enjoyed reading him," the Massachusetts-born Ms. Maddox explained during a recent visit to New York from London, where she has lived since 1960. "I like economy, brevity, precision. He's very purple and over the top."
But as she began to read the existing Lawrence biographies, she discovered affinities to James Joyce, whose life she knew well. "They were English and Irish sides of the same coin," said Ms. Maddox, whose biography of Joyce's wife, Nora, was published in 1988. "They both have reputations as libertines because they wrote about sex, but they both had these mostly monogamous marriages to strong, earthy women."
Ms. Maddox has been asked repeatedly how she feels about her subject, whose racism, anti-Semitism and misogyny have incurred criticism in recent years. "I certainly try not to flinch from the bad side of his character," she said. "But it's always balanced by the exact opposite."
She said she considered only "for about 20 minutes" writing a solo biography of Lawrence's wife, Frieda. "She wasn't that interesting as a character in her own right," Ms. Maddox explained. "She dramatized herself so much -- told her own story and prettied it up. She was no Nora Joyce." MARGALIT FOX

HEADLINE: Counting the Contribution of the Arts

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHICH statement is true? Support for the arts comes at the expense of economic development. Or, the arts are an industry that provides jobs that generate substantial revenues to local, state and Federal governments.
"The first statement is definitely false," said Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council. "For almost five years we have been researching the role played by the arts in community development, and our findings emphatically dispel any misconceptions about the value of the arts." 
 The arts in Westchester, Ms. Langsam continued, represent a growing industry, one that employs 310 people full time and provides part-time jobs for 813 more people. "And 40 new jobs were created this year, which may not seem like a tremendous number," she said. "But if every industry in Westchester showed such an increase we'd all be sitting pretty. Far from being a drain on the community, the arts are part of the solution to our economic woes."
And if it was a business, the arts would be a big one. Nonprofit arts in the United States are a $36.8 billion business supporting 1.3 million full-time jobs. Last year in Westchester, nonprofit arts generated $28 million for the local economy. "That was up by 6 percent from the year before," Ms. Langsam said. "And some of that money is funneled directly back to the state. Last year the state's coffers were enriched by $2.2 million, which was returned in the form of sales tax and income taxes paid by the people who work for Westchester arts organizations."
And when the $28 million is scrutinized more closely, its value quadruples to $112 million, which is the estimated amount that is spent on ancillary items like restaurant meals, baby sitters, gasoline and parking by the 1.1 million people who attend arts events in the county.
Tourism, Ms. Langsam said, is the most measurable economic return on the arts dollar, with 12 percent of the 1.1 million-member audience coming from outside the county.
The council's findings are based on information from the applications of 150 arts organizations that sought grants from the council in 1990.
"The number of grant applications has risen steadily since then," Ms. Langsam added. "We had 182 this year, which makes it difficult for our committee to make the dollar decisions as to who gets what in face of the $150,000 we've lost in donations from area corporations over the last three years."
Organizations receiving grants this year include the Town Wall Muralists, a team consisting of Francesca Samsel and Mariah Fee. The two artists are doing a large mural depicting the history of Peekskill for the newly revived downtown art district in Peekskill. "They initially applied for $2,500, but we were only able to give them $1,000," Ms. Langsam said. "The largest grant we made this year was to the Neuberger Museum of Art at the Purchase College, and that was for $45,000."
In an attempt to increase financial resources available for arts organizations and artists, the council has changed its fund-raising methods, Ms. Langsam said, adding: "We work with a $1.6 million budget but financially it's hard to stay even today. We're running harder than ever just to stay in place."
In order to make up the shortfall, the council is using different ways to get more individuals and foundations involved. "Individuals give more than 80 percent of all charitable donations," Ms. Langsam said. "So we're trying to appeal to individuals by scheduling a lot of small events throughout the year such as wine tastings and theater parties. We hold something every other month, and the results are beginning to show. But our major fund-raiser is our gala benefit, which we've been holding for 17 years now. Last year the gala raised $175,000. This year we hope to hit the $200,000 mark."
Ann F. Peterson, the general manager of the Holiday Inn-Crowne Plaza in White Plains, is this year's chairwoman of the gala, to be held Dec. 10 at the County Center in White Plains. "This year our theme is 1930's swing," Ms. Peterson said. "And what better place is there for such an event than the County Center? It has been at the hub of the county's cultural and social life since it opened in 1930."
For the fourth consecutive year, seven member hotels of the Westchester Hotel Association will collaborate on a menu for the gala, with all food and service contributed by the hotels. "We go all out to show our wares to the gala audience, and we expect 500 people," Ms. Peterson said. "We will also be donating staff. All of us in the hospitality industry are very aware of how much the arts contribute to our individual economic well-being. Attendance at arts events brings business to hotels and restaurants."
And attendance at cultural events is up in Westchester, Ms. Langsam said. "We have so many good new theater companies and so many more high-caliber musical groups in Westchester communities that what's happening is that families are going to New York less and less, finding there are considerable attractions much more affordable and more convenient."
The council's role in the community extends to enlisting a core of business volunteers who give managerial hands-on help to different arts groups. "Texaco sponsors what we call the Business Volunteers for Arts Programs," Ms. Langsam said. "The volunteers are business people who work directly with the staff of the different arts organizations."
One example of how the program works, she said, was what was done when Lyndhurst recently decided to open its carriage house for outside profit-making events like weddings.
"Phyllis Barron, a marketing executive at American Express, met with the Lyndhurst staff and worked with them, showing them how to make their events profitable," Ms. Langsam said. "So far we've made 14 similar successful marriages."
And when a Hudson Valley writers center wanted to conduct an audience-marketing survey, it was another business volunteer, Judy Miller, who runs a marketing concern in Millwood, who donated her services to the project.
"It is another way we are able to add value to our arts organizations," Ms. Langsam said.

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
Why Low-Price Steakhouses

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
THERE is nothing spontaneous or mysterious about restaurant trends. They do not just happen. There are reasons they occur and patterns behind them.
The current surge of budget steakhouses is typical. They are the hottest ticket on the Island. This wave of pubby, casual, inexpensive restaurants mmoving across Nassau and Suffolk is beginning to obscure other trends like Italian family style restaurants, California cuisines, tortilla storefronts and even brick-oven pizza spots. 
 First there was Majors in East Meadow, then Chap's in Syosset, Johnny's in Rockville Centre, Morgan's in Garden City and another Majors in Woodbury. And there are more coming. From Queens to the Hamptons the bargain steakhouses are multiplying, franchising and expanding. More than any single factor one dish is responsible for all the activity. A 24-ounce rib-eye steak for $10.95 is the constant at all the economical steakhouses.
The new-breed steak spots come from an old idea. Although they fill a market niche midway between the dirt-cheap Sizzler and Tad's of yesteryear and the expensive steak palaces of today, that was not Arthur McGreevy's intent more than 15 years ago. Mr. McGreevy, an experienced restaurateur and the owner of Arthur's in Morris Plains, N.J., simply wanted to lure additional customers to his tavern when New Jersey raised the legal drinking age from 18 to 21. He decided to try offering a big steak at a small price. The 24-ounce steak that originally sold for $4.95 worked so well that five years later he opened an Arthur's, in Hoboken, and then two in New Brunswick and Sparta.
Just as there are few new ideas, only reworked old ones, there are no secrets in the restaurant business. Mr. McGreevy's success did not go unnoticed by Long Island restaurateurs, who were quick to recognize a formula that would fill the needs of recession-battered diners. The restaurant owners looked at the low-price steakhouses, studied the menus and in large measure duplicated them. They charged the same rock-bottom prices that Arthur's does for the mammoth steak, overstuffed sandwiches, bulging hamburgers, cole slaw and garlic bread.
But the casual inexpensive steakhouses of Long Island are not carbon copies of Arthur's. The local operators have put their own imprint on the original idea by expanding, adding and gentrifying it. Dean, Gillis and George Poll, the brothers who own Bryant & Cooper and Riverbay, brought the first bargain steakhouse to the Island at the beginning of the year when they opened Majors in East Meadow.
Dean Poll said he and his brothers, who plan to open additional Majors in Queens, are offering "much more than just a cheap steak." Rather, he said, "it is a concept that involves decor, comfort, fun and cash-only family dining, not just affordability."
He also called attention to touches like the old oak tables, purchased from the fabled Lundy's of Brooklyn for the newest Majors in Woodbury, and the chicken, salmon and lobster entrees available in addition to the steak, sandwiches and hamburgers.
If Arthur's and its $10.95 steak was the inspiration for Majors, then Major's success encouraged Tom Posporelis and Andreas Triantaflis to open Chap's, the second low-end steakhouse on the Island, in Syosset. The two partners, who had worked at Riverbay and Bryant & Cooper, as well as many other restaurants, also put their own spin on the concept. They added nightly pasta specials and expanded the appetizer and dessert choices.
Two months ago, John Inclaniato opened Johnny's Steakhouse in Rockville Centre. He plans to open a Johnny's in the Hamptons, then go on to Manhattan and, finally, to franchise outlets. Mr. Inclaniato added valet parking, a fish-of-the-day special and live music to the bargain-steakhouse mixture.
Morgan's Steakhouse opened last month in Garden City with filet mignon, steak pizzaiola, marinated cowboy steak, a fish of the day, corn on the cob and creamed spinach on the menu, in addition to the obligatory 24-ounce $10.95 rib eye.
Obviously, Arthur McGreevey's 15-year-old idea is making a major impact on Long Island. But why did it take 15 years to arrive? Because, Mr. Inclaniato said, "now that the 80's are over, diners are demanding value, and low-cost steakhouses are giving it to them."
 
Wine Tastings
 The Maidstone Arms, in East Hampton (324-5006), and Joseph Phelps Vineyards from the Napa Valley will feature the winery's Insignia Bordeaux-style wines at a five-course, $65 dinner, next Sunday at 6:30 P.M. The vertical tasting will include up to eight consecutive Insignia vintages as well as other Phelps wines. A five-course game dinner of fois gras, venison and other seasonal dishes, prepared by the chef, Bill Valentine, will be paired with the cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc-blended wine.
La Mascotte, the French restaurant at 3 Crooked Hill Road, Commack (499-6446), is holding a five-course Beringer Vineyards wine tasting dinner Tuesday at 7 P.M. The $45 dinner, accompanied by five wines, features duck ravioli with zinfandel sauce and shell of beef Bordelaise.
La Gondola Ristorante, at 275 Old Country Road, Hicksville (433-6262), is celebrating its second anniversary, Wednesday at 6:30 P.M., with a Venetian Night wine makers' dinner. The five-course $49.95 meal is being held in conjunction with Banfi Vintners of Old Brookville, who will pour pinot grigio, brunello di Montalcino and Moscadello di Montalcino wines.
Diners will choose one of two main courses: Beef mignonette sauteed with shallots, wild mushrooms in Amarone sauce or Cornish hen filled with wild rice and served with polenta.
 
Openings
 Cross Roads Cafe, 26 Laurel Road, East Northport (754-2000), is opening where Peter's Inn had been located. Rob Haddow, one of the first chefs at Peter's Inn, purchased the property after the restaurant closed recently. Along with a partner, James Olsen, a Manhattan restaurateur, he is reopening it as a modern American cafe with a Mediterranean skew.
The Long Island Brewing Company, 111 Jericho Turnpike, Jericho (334-2739), a microbrewery, coffee house and restaurant in a turn-of-the-century building, opened last week.
A gleaming copper brewhouse, imported from Prague, is the centerpiece of the microbrewery where an array of ales and lagers, fresh-brewed coffees and teas, single malt scotches and beer-inspired menu specialties will be served. Christopher Palmer, the chef, was formally at Conrad's in Huntington.
Elizabeth's American Bar and Grill, in Syosset, (496-3618), opened on Nov. 18. One of the owners of the restaurant, formerly called Pier of Oyster Bay, remains a principal of the new operation. The decor and chef also remain in place, but a number of nonseafood dishes have ben added to the menu. They include grilled breast of chicken with red onion and roasted tomatoes in a demi-glace sauce ($12.95) and rigattoni with chicken, broccoli and sun-dried tomatoes ($9.95).
 
Potpourri
 The country table, or tavola di campagna, prix-fixe menu at the Chalet, 1 Railroad Avenue in Roslyn (621-7975), has become so popular that the restaurant has a new menu designed around it. The menu offers two country-table meals. The first contains an antipasto of grilled vegetables, salad and seafood or a seafood salad with one of three pastas for $14.95. Hearty eaters can add an entree to the two courses, making the complete dinner cost $21.95 to $29.95.
Route 66, 33 West Sunrise Highway, Merrick (623 Route 66), is serving a Sunday brunch from 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. The meal, which offers a la carte appetizers, breakfast and lunch dishes, sides and desserts, includes Mexican Champagne, fresh orange juice or a Bloody Mary. Among the main dishes are a Southwestern egg-and-cheese enchilada ($6.95), Cobb salad ($9.95) and a pan-fried catfish sandwich ($7.95).
Jonathan's, 15 Wall Street, Huntington (549-0055), is now open seven days a week. The restaurant, which has introduced a fall-winter menu, also offers a price-fixed menu every night but Fridays and Saturdays that includes soup, salad or appetizer and entree at prices from $15.50 to $20.50.

HEADLINE: Population Trends Hold Surprises

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
A REPORT issued earlier this month on the county's population has broad implications for educators, health-care workers and taxpayers, demographers and planning officials said last week.
The report, "Westchester County and Municipalities: Population Estimates for Jan. 1, 1993," found that last year's count of 885,731 follows moderate increases since 1990 and reverses a downward trend of the 1970's and 1980's. 
 The latest figures reflect an increase in both the birth rate and migration to Westchester from other countries and other parts of the New York City area, according to the County Planning Department.
The report predicts that if the birth rate continues at its high level, if the economic recovery continues at a moderate pace and if migration continues at its current level, Westchester's population will exceed 890,000 by 1995, approaching 1970's historic ceiling of 894,000.
The County Clerk's office reported last week that there was a surge last year in naturalizations, which paralleled an increase in immigrants counted by the Planning Department.
Demographers had predicted that the county's population would stabilize in the 90's, and Planning Department officials said they were surprised to find the population up by 1 percent in 1990 and 1.24 percent last year.
Last year's increase was mainly the result of growth by two groups -- school-age children and the elderly. That is expected to have a profound impact on both the type and amount of public services needed in the future, officials said.
For one, the number of children entering the public schools has jumped in recent years -- the result of the highest birth rates since the mid-60's. In 1992, there were 15 births per 1,000 people in Westchester, compared with 11.4 births per 1,000 in 1982.
While birth rates are not expected to hit the record high of 19.6 per 1,000 in 1961, the recent surge -- or boomlet, as it is being called -- was not expected. School planners nevertheless face serious implications.
Mary R. Carlson, a researcher for the Department of Planning, attributed the boomlet in part to post World War II baby boomers who are bearing children relatively late in life.
Children entering school next fall in Westchester are expected to be among the largest class in the county since 1970, and they will be followed by even larger classes of children born since 1990.
Last year, there were 10,141 students enrolled in Westchester's public kindergarten classes, compared with 7,193 in 1983.
Ruth Robinson, a statistician for the State Department of Education, said that the increase in incoming kindergarten classes occurred as the overall public school enrollment dropped to 115,996, from 117,598 in 1983.
Evelyn M. Stock, president of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, a nonprofit organization serving 55 school boards, said that the growing enrollments are translating into pocketbook issues.
"We're talking about a greater tax burden, new buildings in some cases and caring for new populations with special needs -- the immigrants," she said.
Janet S. Walker, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, said that both the smaller, suburban school districts and the big city systems were feeling the impact of newly arrived immigrants in the classroom and that by law public schools were required to educate all children "regardless of their legal status." In California earlier this month, voters approved a proposition that would limit public services like education to illegal immigrants, but a Federal judge later blocked implementation of the law pending determination of Constitutional questions of due process and invasion of privacy.
The largest immigrant groups in the county include those from Japan, India, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands, Korea, China and the Middle East.
Dee R. Barbato, a program administrator in the County Clerk's office, reported that her office was performing more than 300 naturalizations a month -- more than double the usual number. She said the increase that began last year followed a general amnesty granted five years ago by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service to illegal immigrants. In most cases, it takes about five years to complete the paperwork and classes needed to become naturalized.
Dr. Vincent T. Beni, Superintendent of Schools in Hastings-on-Hudson and president of the Southern Westchester Chief School Administrators, noted that the demands on school districts for more classrooms and teachers comes at a time when state aid has hit historic lows.
Dr. Beni, whose organization represents 35 school districts, said schools were facing devastating pressures and many districts had to float bonds to pay for renovations and expansion.
At the same time that the school-age population has been increasing, the Department of Planning's population report for last year said that the number of elderly living in Westchester -- those older than 60 -- had also risen, while the number of young adults and middle-aged people remained relatively stable.
According to 1990 census figures, there were 170,971 elderly people in Westchester during 1990, up from 126,023 a decade earlier. Moreover, the number of "old-old" residents, those over 85, had increased by 35.9 percent in a decade to 14,200 by 1990.
The Planning Department's report showed that the nursing-home population had increased to 8,759 by 1992 from 7,256 in 1990.
"What was unbelievable and unique -- like living to be 100 -- is becoming more commonplace," said Laura Bolotsky, an administrator for the County Office for the Aging, who said that as population figures for the elderly rose, her office was increasingly being called upon for its services.
The Office for the Aging finances municipal and agency services for the elderly: nutrition, transportation, housing assistance, crime prevention and legal aid. It also provides information and referrals for nutritionists and has a case-management staff, which attempts to prevent premature institutionalization.
Its $8 million yearly budget "is certainly seeing a strain," said Mae Carpenter, director of the office. "We're stretching ourselves to the limit. It's a triage situation. First, we have to serve those most at risk. Then we look at preventive care. Sometimes, quality-of-life services get pushed to the side."
Ms. Stock of the school boards association said that the elderly, who were often on fixed incomes, were also being called upon as taxpayers to pay for new school expenses.
"They are being squeezed financially," she said. "But they are also grandparents, and when it comes to funding schools, we hope they are able to look at the broader picture."
The Planning Department's population estimate report -- the first in a new series prepared by the research division of the department -- also reported an increase in the number of single-person households. Between 1980 and 1990, those numbers were up by 25 percent to 322,999, and about half of those represented elderly people living alone. The 1993 report did not contain revised figures.
The report also says that the county is showing signs of recovering from the economic recession of the late 80's and early 90's, demonstrated by the absorption of unsold and unoccupied housing in many parts of Westchester, along with an increasing demand for new residential units.
The population estimates were arrived at, in part, by using housing-vacancy rates from the 1990 census in the absence of more recent data, the report says.
Population increases were registered by all cities in the county, with the largest gains in Peekskill (up 2.61 percent to 20,045), White Plains (up 1.87 percent to 49,627) and Yonkers (up 1.22 percent to 190,377).
Population in the northern part of the county grew at twice the rate of the county, with an increase of about 5,600 or 2.3 percent.
The central part, led by Greenburgh and White Plains, grew by 1.04 percent or 2,200 people.
Growth in the southern tier of Westchester, while modest, was bolstered by an increase of nearly 2,300 in Yonkers and represented the first population gain in that part of the county in more than 20 years.

HEADLINE: On the Right Track

BYLINE: By Ada Louise Huxtable; Ada Louise Huxtable is an architectural historian, critic and consultant.

 BODY:
Thirty-one years ago, the shattered marble, travertine and granite columns, caryatids, gods and eagles of Penn Station -- modeled after the monuments of ancient Rome by McKim, Mead and White and built for eternity in 1910 -- were carted off to the Secaucus meadows, giving New Jersey undisputed title to the world's most elegant dump. Of the eagles that crowned the station's walls, a few tokens were reinstalled in front of the new Madison Square Garden, making the contrast between classical and cheesy terminally (pun intended) clear.
Because what goes around comes around, usually so that you want to laugh or cry, there are plans for a new Penn Station. The proposal is part of a program in which all of the facilities for Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Railroad will be coordinated for what is now fashionably called intermodal transportation but looks more like a railroad revival and great train station renaissance. 
 In addition to vastly improved and expanded services, each rail unit will be given a "presence" -- something Stanford White and his partners knew a thing or two about. And since what goes around comes around in curious ways, the new Penn Station will be created in another classical building by McKim, Mead and White: the James A. Farley Post office, a designated New York City landmark just behind the present station, which has been declared obsolete by the Post Office and semi-surplus property by the Federal Government.
Central to the project is the creation of a large new concourse, reminiscent of the scale of the bulldozed terminal. Because the rail yards continue beneath the Post Office building, the conversion is practical. But it is just as much about lost glory as future needs.
The Post Office is a gargantuan box of die-stamped classicism that occupies the two full blocks between 31st and 33d Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues. It was built in two stages: the first, in 1913, extended halfway to Ninth Avenue; an annex, added in 1935, filled out the enormous double block.
The original facade's nonstop 53-foot-high Corinthian columns and anthemion cresting topping a two-block sweep of granite steps was repeated and wrapped around the addition for what must surely be the most redundant colonnade in architectural history. This competent piece of Beaux Arts boiler-plate isn't in the same league as the old Penn Station. But today its acres of space and irreplaceable materials and details are solid gold.
The Post Office will keep the arcade along Eighth Avenue, where 7,000 people a day come through bronze doors under an arched ceiling decorated with the seals of the countries belonging to the postal union. One hopes that the nicely browned WPA murals of the city at the north and south ends will remain.
The plans for the new station, which will incorporate the redesigned present facility, have been under study since the 1980's by an alliance of railroad, postal service, real estate, construction and Government interests, led by Amtrak and the Tishman Urban Development Corporation. The architects are Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, a large firm experienced in the kinds of major undertakings with which such consortiums feel comfortable, working with a consultant on historic architecture, Jan Pokorny.
The cost is budgeted at an optimistic $300 million -- one-third Federal, one-third city and state and one-third to be supplied by Amtrak. Under the enthusiastic sponsorship of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, half of the Federal commitment, $50 million, had been appropriated before the Republican upheaval that will replace the Senator as head of the Finance Committee in January. With Federal funding halfway home and agreements signed by the city and state, the odds still look good.
Behind the "rebirth" of Penn Station is a 25-year story full of the twists of fate and fortune that give economists and futurists a bad name. Who could have predicted the knockout blow that air travel dealt to rail travel in the 50's and 60's? Or foreseen the postmodern crisis in architecture that sensitized architects and the public to the losses of the past? The majestic urban terminals, too expensive to operate and functionally obsolete, were abandoned to decay or demolished as prime sites "ripe for redevelopment" -- the real estate mantra of the times.
The decline of the railroads paralleled the rise of the shopping mall, the growth of the preservation movement and the birth of the "festival marketplace." Recycled railroad stations, once left for dead, became filled with shops and restaurants and a notable preservation success. But this was an odd triumph in which the tail wagged the dog: retailing was the prime use and purpose, and train service was peripheral, if it existed at all.
For years, Washington's Union Station rained debris from its magnificent barrel-vaulted ceiling ringed with heroic statues into a hole in the ground meant for a visitors' center that came to nothing. Train service was relegated to a kind of outhouse in the rear. Today this is one of the country's most successful indoor malls, but the trains are still out back.
Real change came in the 1970's, when Government action to save the railroads brought grants and subsidies for operation and terminal upgrading. As ridership increased, station renovations put the trains up front again. Concourses were no longer treated as real estate opportunities. And while retail has become an important source of revenue, it is now supportive rather than primary. After a spectacular century of highs and lows, the great railroad station is being redefined.
That redefinition recognizes and restores the tradition of public space -- the "waste space" of bureaucrats and bean counters. The early, published proposal for Penn Station's new central concourse as an enormous space frame covering the area of the Post Office's huge, skylit mail-sorting court was more Buck Rogers than McKim, Mead and White; it has gone back to the drawing board.
The future roof will rise as high as cautious preservation agencies permit, but height is essential here. The court's original skylight never soared, in any sense. The Post Office is more like a classical corset for new construction than a creative inspiration. (For that, one should see Rafael Moneo's stunning and sympathetic additions to the superbly restored railroad station in Madrid.)
Meanwhile, at Grand Central a restoration and revitalization plan of exemplary quality by the architects Beyer, Blinder, Belle is forging ahead. New York's other great terminal has survived its own threats, including a traumatic proposal to build a gargantuan tower of aggressive vulgarity on top, the cruelest of jokes on its Beaux Arts splendor. This was fought up to the Supreme Court, winning a substantial victory for the city's landmark designation.
Over the years, grime and neglect obscured the constellations of the 125-foot-high concourse ceiling, light ceased to filter through the immense arched windows and the bulbs of the mammoth chandeliers disappeared and dimmed.
Government money, the return of rail travel and the upgrading of revenue-producing commercial space have contributed to the ongoing and outstanding restoration and improvement of the terminal's technical, structural and architectural elements by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Metro North Railroad.
With the east balcony free of Kodak's full-color sabotage, a new stair is planned to match the existing stair to the Vanderbilt Avenue balcony on the west, for access to restaurants in the underused balconies and mezzanine. The addition is in the spirit and letter of Warren and Wetmore's brilliant 1903 to 1913 classical design. But only a faithful replica of the present stair will do.
To sit at the one small restaurant on the west balcony is to long for more. Rising into those vast heights is the buzz of all the voices of travelers and transients mingling in the upper air. Shafts of sunlight pierce long shadows, spotlighting the moving figures on the floor. The soft, susurring sound transforms activity and motion into a shared experience; it contains the timeless promise of the city's, and the world's, pleasures and adventures. This is the essence of urbanity.
In Penn Station, the traveler will never set foot again in the Tepidarium of the Baths of Caracalla. To the architect charged with creating the new Penn Station's symbolic center, lots of luck; he has a long way to go. Grand Central is right on track. These are some of the best and most beautiful social spaces anywhere, and the more use we make of them, the better.

HEADLINE: Effort to Sell or Lease Nassau Medical Center Stumbles

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST MEADOW, L.I., Nov. 27

 BODY:
The effort to sell or lease the Nassau County Medical Center to private operators is off to a doubtful start, and some officials say it may die a slow death.
Although some health-industry experts say that private management of the medical center, Long Island's largest public hospital, is an idea whose time has come, resistance is growing and bidders complain that the county's requirements make privatization almost impossible. 
 Meanwhile, some county officials say, an improving economy and greater efficiency at the 615-bed hospital may make privatization less attractive.
Still, some industry experts argue that competing interests may slow the process of selling or leasing the hospital, but that market forces on Long Island and around the country will eventually make a change to private management inevitable.
"Every public hospital in the United States today is in one way or another thinking about going private," said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, among whose 91 members is the Nassau center. "The attraction seems to be the efficiency of operation and fast decision-making in private hospitals, traditions not usually found in the public sector."
Nassau officials said the recession and a loss of nearly 25 percent of its patients to managed-care hospitals were particularly hard on the county hospital. Until last year, when the hospital showed a profit, it had run an average annual deficit of $10 million since 1986.
The string of deficits, officials said, made it increasingly difficult to maintain the hospital's original mission -- to provide quality medical care for all county residents, regardless of ability to pay.
The county, hard pressed not to increase taxes, forced a reduction in staff and services at the hospital in 1992 and 1993, and then turned to the idea of privatization.
Thomas S. Gulotta, the County Executive, appointed a 15-member committee to seek and review bids to buy, lease or manage not only the medical center but also the county's A. Holly Patterson Geriatric Center and nine public health clinics.
The committee received 14 bids on Oct. 20, including offers from several Long Island hospitals. Five were for the medical center, four were for the geriatric center and five were for the health clinics.
Among the bidders was North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, which proposed managing the medical center while allowing the county to retain ownership. North Shore also sought to manage some of the clinics.
North Shore officials said the requirements set by the committee for purchase of the county hospital were too restrictive.
"The provisions are such that they preclude privatization, so we suggested a managerial role of some kind," said Carol Hauptman, a spokeswoman for North Shore.
She said the committee was insisting on full job protection for all of the employees at the medical center; full care for the poor, including illegal aliens and those without insurance, and no reductions in existing programs and services.
"Those three requirements for purchase make privatization unrealistic, if not totally impossible," Ms. Hauptman said.
County officials said they were only trying to get taxpayers the best deal possible.
"We want to save the county money, meet the demands of workers at the hospital and do the right thing for everybody," said Alan Gurien, first deputy county comptroller.
He said that so far only two of the five proposals for the medical center "looked promising." He said the bids were from Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, which has offered to buy, lease or operate all of the facilities, and Capitol Health Management of Bayside, Queens, which has offered to manage all the facilities for five years, with an option for another five years. Talks with Winthrop are scheduled for Monday.
The committee is to make a recommendation to Mr. Gulotta within the next several months. Should it fail to reach a consensus, the panel could suggest alternatives, such as easing the bidding requirements, forming a public-benefit corporation to run the facilities or making no changes at all.
The committee's recommendation would be far from the final word on the matter, since privatization would need the approval of the State Health Department and the six-member Nassau County Board of Supervisors. The process could be further complicated if it extends into 1996, when a new 19-member county legislature takes office.
Mr. Gurien said the county had long aided the medical center with subsidies, including cash and debt service. He said cash subsidies totaled $14 million in 1992, but because of cost-cutting, dropped to zero in 1993.
Among the chief critics of the proposed sale of county health facilities is Rita Wallace, another member of the committee and president of the Nassau County Civil Service Employees Association. Nearly 5,000 of the union's 12,000 members work at the hospital, the geriatric center and the clinics.
"We're in the midst of a national debate on health-care reform," she said, "and it's not the time to be talking about removing a support system for a large number of the county's working poor who have no health insurance. Where else would these people go?"
Ms. Wallace predicted that the effort to privatize would "die a natural death" because she doubted that prospective bidders would "ever be able to submit proposals to match the criteria established by the county."

HEADLINE: New York Starts Spinning Its Dross into Gold

SERIES: Reinventing Garbage -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By JO THOMAS 

 BODY:
Last summer's empty containers for bleach, spring water, dish detergent, antifreeze, baby wipes, cat litter and motor oil have come back to New York streets this fall as traffic barricades. Con Edison has ordered 25,000, all white. The city has bought 3,200 sets of legs made from fabric-softener bottles, all light blue.
The barricades, made by Utility Plastic Recycling in East New York, Brooklyn, use only a small part of the 600 tons of plastic, glass and metal the city recycles every day, but they are a visible sign that the city's recycling program is finding new uses for millions of residential and commercial castaways. 
 In the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, 15 million clear plastic two-liter soft drink bottles, recycled into plastic lumber, will be used to build a 607-ton fishing pier, complete with gazebos and benches, at Tiffany Street on the East River. The old wooden pier is being demolished. The new one, to be finished by June, will not appeal to the tiny marine organisms that eat their way through wooden pilings.
Beyond creating new ways to use old materials, recycling is also creating jobs. In Manhattan's office paper forest, the World Trade Center this year is yielding 3,000 tons of used paper, the equivalent of 50,000 trees. A crew of 20 workers, many of them homeless or formerly homeless, sorts it into nine different grades before it goes out by the truckload.
"We are mining a resource very few cities have," said Councilman Stanley E. Michels, the Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the City Council's Committee on Environmental Protection. "We have probably the best garbage in the world" -- huge quantities of office paper, for instance -- "and more of it than anyone else."
While the collection of recyclables is the most visible and expensive part of the city's program, city officials say it is the reuse of these items that justifies the effort and may someday underwrite its cost, now $77 million a year to pick up and process newspapers, glass, foil and plastic from homes, schools, hospitals and housing projects.
In fact, New York's growing supplies of materials, combined with strong foreign and domestic markets, have spurred the establishment and expansion of so many private processing plants that the city, which contracts with 14 different companies, has all but abandoned a plan to build five city-owned plants. Now, only one is planned, for Staten Island, and its size has been scaled back drastically.
The question mark for the private sector is how strongly City Hall will back the collection program, and what role the city will play in encouraging new markets by purchasing recycled material.
New York already buys more than $11 million a year in recycled goods, and in January the city will follow Federal guidelines by requiring 20 percent of the content of office paper to have been recycled (not merely unused scraps). Recycled goods are also given a price advantage in competitive bidding, 10 percent for paper goods and 5 percent for other products with a recycled content.
"Whether it's chicken and egg or smoke and mirrors, you have to convince industry that if they make the product, someone will buy it," said Ivan Braun, former director of environmental purchasing for the city's Department of General Services. "On the other hand, you can't buy it unless someone makes it. To convince industry to invest dollars into a new venture, you have to send the message 'We want it.' "
The Giuliani administration does want to develop markets, said Peter J. Powers, the Deputy Mayor for Operations. "The city makes $7.3 billion in purchases. To the extent we can, we are putting our priority on it," he said.
New York state's Office of Recycling Market Development, the first of its kind in the nation, has used $21 million in state financing to attract $253 million in private capital for 21 recycling businesses since 1988. These have created 889 jobs. Utility Plastics was one of these new companies.
William Ferretti, director of that office, is also co-chairman of a national project of the National Recycling Coalition, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and Clean Washington Center to start trading recyclables at the Chicago Board of Trade by next summer.
"Buyers and sellers will have greater certainty about the availability, quality and true value of those materials," Mr. Ferretti said. "Right now, it's very difficult for sellers like the city, as well as private sellers, to identify the true value of the materials they're making available to sell."
The biggest fear of buyers, he said, "is that they can't get enough supply."
 
The Supply
Building Demand And Confidence
 Entrepreneurs who buy, sell, and use recyclables say stable supplies of these materials are essential. But the supplies depend on the willingness of the public to make the effort to separate the foil, the plastic, the glass and the paper that they would otherwise toss in the trash can.
Some in the recycling business suggest that New York has a credibility problem with its program, caused partly by the fact that the Sanitation Department trucks that pick up regular garbage also pick up recyclables.
"People see the compactor truck," said Nancy Wolf, director of special projects for the Environmental Action Coalition. "They think it goes to landfills."
Sooner or later, said Joseph Vecchio, co-owner of Star Recycling and BQE Services in Brooklyn, people end up asking him: Isn't it true that all this stuff just goes to the dump?
"It's real!" Mr. Vecchio shouted over the roar of trucks and machinery. "When I read articles that say recycling is not real, I get enraged. Why would I throw away something I can sell for $50 a ton to $190 a ton?"
At one side of his building under the Kosciusko Bridge in Brooklyn was a mountain of blue recycling bags. On another side were bales of aluminum cans, plastic jugs and bottles, foil, cardboard and office paper. He handles commercial waste and figures that roughly a third of New York's recyclable cans and bottles end up here.
At the moment, a buyer wants old polystyrene, which can be made into videotape cartridges. Another wants clean shrink wrap, which can be reused to make plastic containers. The problem for Mr. Vecchio is how to collect enough, cheaply enough.
Each week he ships out more than 1,500 tons of cardboard. Office paper is running 300 tons a week. Aluminum cans. Steel cans. Aluminum foil. Everything is baled. Everything is sold but the blue plastic recycling bags. They are too dirty, Mr. Vecchio said.
For people like Mr. Vecchio, one of the biggest challenges in recycling is dealing with plastic. While there are many kinds of plastic, they can contaminate each other if mixed.
Also, many plastics can be recycled only once because manufacturing processes change their structure. Plastic that is recycled to make fibers for clothing or rugs, for example, will deteriorate when used again.
Steel, glass and aluminum, on the other hand, can be recycled again and again. In New York, however, the glass is not recycled into glass because most of it breaks in the sanitation trucks before it can be sorted. Instead, recycling companies grind the mixed glass back into sand or sell it for use in asphalt.
New contracts with the city Department of Transportation require that glass be used in asphalt, and the city is hoping to increase the market for glass from 40,000 tons a year to 75,000 tons a year.
 
Jobs
Recycling Finds Value in Lives, Too
 In addition to the money the city receives for the recycled products, several studies have said the program also can help the city create jobs. One study, done last winter by the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College, reported that New York already had about 3,000 establishments in industries related to solid-waste management, reuse and repair, and recycling. Those businesses account for nearly 34,000 jobs and a payroll of over $1 billion.
If the city instituted an intensive recycling system like the one it has been running as an experiment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, the study asserted, enough raw materials could be produced to spur businesses to create 20,392 more jobs.
Another study, conducted last year by Appleseed, an economic development consulting concern, said new recycling businesses could create up to 4,000 jobs, largely in neighborhoods bypassed by the boom of the 1980's: Hunts Point in the Bronx, Red Hook and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, and the northwest shore of Staten Island.
The Grand Central Partnership, a business improvement district, has developed an employment program for the homeless to sort vast quantities of paper, from cardboard to shredded documents, at the World Trade Center. The program is run through a contract with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the building.
The World Trade Center has been recycling for 20 years but stepped up the effort in 1991, placing recycling containers at workstations throughout the building. Charles J. Maikish, director of the World Trade Center, said the building recycles 38 percent of its trash and saves $500,000 a year in trash collection costs.
In addition to the paper, it recycles 1,000 tons of plastic, glass, and metals, and another 600,000 aluminum cans a year. Barbara Iannacone-Ramos, who coordinates the program, said recycling sales now bring in $150,000 a year, and the highest bids for a new contract for 1995 average $800,000 a year.
"We would like to expand this to other buildings," said Thomas Rigney, director of research and development for the Grand Central Partnership. Some workers have gone to better-paying jobs. Others found a place to live.
Blondell Welles said she was homeless when she started work last year, and she now lives in an apartment in the South Bronx. It takes her anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to sort each giant bin, depending on how many kinds of paper she encounters. "I love it," she said.
"What's happening here," said Mr. Maikish, "is recovering the valuables," and he was talking about more than just the paper.
 
The Alternative
The Great Mound At Fresh Kills?
 What isn't recovered, whether it is paper, food scraps, cardboard boxes or discarded appliances, has only one place to go: the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. Because New Yorkers do not pay directly for residential garbage pickup and because the city owns what has been seen to be a free landfill, Fresh Kills has grown to 25 times the size of the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt and rivals the Great Wall of China as the largest man-made object in the world.
The garbage arrives by barge, day and night, and when it is dark, the compactors work by floodlight. From 4 P.M. Saturday to midnight Sunday there is a 32-hour pause, but "we never really end," said John J. Doherty, the Sanitation Commissioner, who lived on Staten Island as a child and has watched the landfill expand.
The items that make up this colossus are nothing extraordinary: paper plates, a baby blanket, a pink flowerpot, a white laundry basket, a Roy Rogers french fry carton. Across the expressway is a mall with the usual theaters and shops, selling the very items that end up in the landfill.
Fresh Kills has 90 million tons of air space, Mr. Doherty observed. "We're bringing 13,000 tons a day. It could probably last 22 years at that rate. The question is, will we be able to recycle more? We could last longer."
 
 
 
SORTING IT OUT
Do's and Don'ts of Recycling
 There are many misconceptions about what can be recycled in New York City, officials say. Here are guidelines from the Sanitation Department for citywide residential recycling.
 
PAPER: You can recycle newspapers, magazines, catalogues, telephone books and flattened corrugated cardboard boxes. These must be tied with sturdy twine into bundles no more than 18 inches high and placed next to your recycling container.
You can't recycle hardback or paperback books, cereal boxes, shoe boxes, shirt cardboards, gift boxes (or anything else made of smooth gray cardboard), white paper, envelopes or junk mail.
 
GLASS, METAL, FOIL: You can recycle metal cans (including tuna, soup and pet food cans), glass bottles, glass jars, aluminum foil, pie pans and take-out tins. They should be rinsed clean.
You can't recycle aerosol cans or pump sprays, paint cans or chemical containers, ceramics, light bulbs or mirrors.
 
PLASTIC: You can recycle containers for plastic detergent, shampoo, soda, juice or milk, and water bottles and jugs. Labels are O.K., but nonplastic parts must be removed.
You can't recycle yogurt cups, the plastic or cardboard lids of take-out tins, anything made of polystyrene (like coffee cups or egg cartons), plastic-coated paper (like milk cartons or candy wrappers), plastic bags (including dry cleaning bags and sandwich wrap), plastic plates, cups or bowls, or appliances like clocks, radios and hair dryers.

HEADLINE: Volleying Over Budget Is Heating Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
The battle between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council for primacy over the city's budget grew more heated yesterday as the Giuliani administration asserted that the Council's spending plan would leave the city budget $100 million out of balance.
Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said yesterday that cuts Council sought in the number of employees in the Mayor's finance office and in the sheriff's department would reduce revenue because of slower processing and collection of city taxes and fines for parking tickets. 
 "These are people who generate revenue," Mr. Powers said in an interview. "So if you cut their jobs you save their salaries, but you eliminate the revenue they bring in. The Council did this because they acted hastily and without public debate. This is what happens when you don't think things through."
In response, Kevin R. McCabe, chief of staff to Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, said that Council had merely "asked the administration to do what the administration is asking everyone else to do: to be more productive." Mr. McCabe added that revenues need not be affected under the Council plan. "All they have to do is to be more efficient," he said.
The volleying between the two sides indicated that there was no end in sight to the most serious budget confrontation between a mayor and the Council since the city's new Charter took effect nearly five years ago. It also came one day after Mayor Giuliani vetoed an alternative spending plan passed by the Council to close a $1.1 billion gap in New York City's budget.
With strong support from Republican members, the Council resoundingly rejected the Mayor's own budget plan before passing its own by a vote of 43 to 5. Mr. Giuliani called the legislature's spending plan "blatantly illegal" and "fiscally irresponsible."
Immediately after the Mayor's action, Mr. Vallone insisted that the Council would override the veto, setting the stage for a legal confrontation on which side of City Hall would ultimately prevail in enacting a budget revision. The Council has until Dec. 9 to override the Mayor's veto, which can only be done by a two-thirds majority, or 34 votes.
Mr. Giuliani said he has found enough revenue to enable him to unilaterally restore some of the items included in the plan approved by the Council on Wednesday. Money will be restored for mental health programs, soup kitchens and alternate-week recycling, Mr. Powers said. Other restorations will be announced later this week, he said, declining to identify other areas.
Mr. Powers said that the Mayor was still willing to "move around" $40 million to satisfy some of the concerns of Council members about various programs initially cut by the Mayor. "But we don't have a penny above that," Mr. Powers said. "And if we can't reach an agreement, we're going to treat their restoration as a nullity."
Specifically, the Giuliani administration said that the Council's plan to cut 123 jobs in the Mayor's finance division would cost $19 million in tax revenue because there would be fewer people to process collection data. They also insisted that a plan to eliminate 63 positions in the Parking Violations Bureau would lead to fewer summonses being written and a withering effort to collect from scofflaws, resulting in a loss of $6.5 million in revenue.
Mr. Powers also said that the Council plan would eliminate the workers in the Mayor's Economic Development Office who are working on the sale of the city-owned hotel adjacent to the United Nations. "Without those people, the sale of the hotel would likely not materialize," Mr. Powers said. "That represents about $65 million in our budget that wouldn't be coming in."
Bernard Rosen, the administration's deputy budget director, said that the Council's plan to reduce overtime in the sheriff's office would cut revenue from the city's scofflaw towing program by $12 million. "The cuts will delay the sheriffs' office's ability to hire additional deputy sheriffs," Mr. Rosen said.
Thomas L. McMahon, the director of the Council's finance division, said that the administration's contention that the sale of the hotel property was in jeopardy was "ridiculous."
He said that the administration has "at least five offices that do forecasting on the hotel business." He added, "And by marrying those efforts, they can realize savings. When you talk about reinventing government, you have to be creative."
On the Council's vote to reduce overtime spending in the sheriff's office, Mr. McMahon criticized the administration for its plan to add more than $150 million in overtime spending. "Adding that amount to overtime spending is beyond belief," he said. "All the Council is doing is to say that the agencies have to be managed better."
No meetings between the Mayor's staff and Council officials were held over the weekend. But despite the hard line he took on the Council's action, Mr. Powers suggested that there might yet be some room for negotiation between the Mayor and the Council.
"There is not a breakdown in communication between the Council and the Mayor's office," Mr. Powers said. "We're still dealing in a constructive relationship and anything's still possible."

HEADLINE: Military Town Opening Doors As Base Closes

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, La., Nov. 26

 BODY:
It was the memory of a weed-savaged tarmac and boarded-up buildings at an abandoned military base elsewhere that galvanized James L. Meyer in 1990 when word floated in from Washington that the local Air Force base here, the region's largest employer, was likely to close.
"I remember walking around there and it was so sad," said Mr. Meyer, referring to a military base in Lake Charles, La. No one was sure that the base in Alexandria would in fact be shuttered. But "I said, 'We have to make a contingency plan here or we're doomed.' " Mr. Meyer recalled. 
 Loren C. Scott, an economics professor at Louisiana State University, told the city's business and civic leaders, "if you don't do anything, you're going to lose a decade's worth of employment."
"Generally, Alexandria was a fairly sleepy place," Mr. Scott said. "There didn't seem to be any fired up economic activity and they were headed for disaster."
But there has been no catastrophe. Instead, a coalition of determined business and government leaders has devised a plan to take over the England Air Force Base and use it to stimulate economic growth in a part of Louisiana that most people here had thought of as little more than an oyster-and-grits backwater.
About 95 military bases across the country are scheduled to close this decade, and the success here has become a model for cities and towns facing base closings elsewhere. Many of them have sent representatives here to see what has taken place in this town of 50,000 people in the pine country of central Louisiana. Last month, a delegation from Locknitz in eastern Germany, which was left with an abandoned Russian army base this year, stopped by.
Today, there are 13 tenants at the former England Air Force Base, including a truck-driver training center, a company that tests airplane instruments, an aircraft inspection company, a new local magnet school -- the first school to be established on a closed base -- and a 65-bed hospital that is operated by the state for the region's poor. A year from now, a commuter airline will move to the base from a little airfield 12 miles away.
The result has been a dramatic surge in jobs, home building and retail sales, Mr. Scott said. "If you look at a graph of employment in the area, it is growing at a more rapid rate than before," he said. "It's a complete reversal of what they've done in the past. To me this is a really remarkable story. It's the community saying, let's choose our own destiny."
The bust-and-boom cycle of the energy industry had never intruded in Alexandria like it had in much of the state, but neither had big business. Cotton and soybeans surround a city whose economic backbone had largely been small business but which, since World War II, had relied on England Air Force Base here and Fort Polk about 40 miles away to fuel its growth. In addition to the 3,000 military personnel at the base, 1,000 civilians worked there, too.
When word of a possible closing coursed through here four years ago, despair settled over the region like a deep fog. "The fact that the base was going to close was a shock to everyone," said Jim Butler, the managing editor of the local newspaper, the Alexandria Daily Town Talk. "It was doom and gloom." Construction of new homes dried up, retailers began feeling pinched as sales slowed and local banks began calling in loans.
So Mr. Meyer, who had just finished a term as president of the Chamber of Commerce, gathered some local business leaders and four elected officials and began devising a secret plan to take over the base when the last Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt lifted off the 9,000-foot runway.
"We had a public effort to save the base, and the local government was pretty much behind all that," Mr. Meyer said. "But we decided we had to have a contingency plan in case the base did close. And we kept it secret so that the Air Force didn't get the wrong idea, that we wanted the base to close."
England Air Force Base sprawled across 2,282 acres, and came with 501 buildings, including hangars, a hospital, a school and an officer's club. There were houses and apartments for about 600 residents, a golf course, a railroad engine and a pocket nature reserve, Le Tig Bayou Wildlife Center.
"One of our goals became that we have to get control of the assets and keep it together," Mr. Meyer said. "We couldn't have a lot of squabbling over the assets, a dilution of these assets if we were going to make anything out of the base." When the Georgia Air Force Base closed in Southern California, nearby communities thundered into court to lay claim to the base and local congressmen took up the cudgels for their respective constituents. "We didn't want that happening here," Mr. Meyer said.
What Mr. Meyer and his colleagues created, with assistance from the Legislature, was an independent authority charged with the economic development of the entire region of central Louisiana. Although the last Air Force jet left here two years ago, the Federal Government has not ceded title to the base, but the authority is expecting that to happen in January. In the meantime, the authority has taken over the base with the right to lease many of its buildings and the hangars and runways. The state also gave the authority the right to issue revenue bonds to support economic development in the region.
The authority wanted an anchor tenant with a national reputation that could serve as a magnet for other businesses. That first tenant turned out to be J. B. Hunt Transport Inc., one of the country's largest trucking companies, which established a driver training school at England.
Since 1992, the company, which employs 11,700 drivers, has trained about 3,000 drivers in the four-week program at England, which provides not only a large swath of concrete for the driver trainees to roll around on, but also dormitories and office space.
In addition, the authority that oversees England arranged a student loan program with the state for the driver trainees.
Luring Hunt to England was precisely what the businessmen of Alexandria were hoping for. "If you want to be a tenant here," Mr. Meyer explained, "it has to be new jobs and expansion. We just don't want a company moving here for cheap rent. And everyone has to pay rent here, even the public bodies."
Dealing with the Air Force has not been a painless experience, said Jon W. Grafton, the executive director of the England Economic and Industrial Development District, as the authority is formally known. "It was not confrontational, but there have been vigorous discussions." Among the most vigorous were the negotiations over the disposal of the $90 million in property on the base, everything from X-ray equipment in the hospital, to television sets to the fire and rescue trucks. "Personal property was fought over chair by chair, table by table. It's important to be able to tell a tenant as a lagniappe that you've got tables and chairs and lights for them."
Under Louisiana law, the England authority is chartered like a municipality, which gives it the right to issue bonds. Earlier this year, after failing to persuade the Boise Cascade Corporation to set up a manufacturing operation at the base, the authority found another site for the forest products company nearby and issued $50 million in revenue bonds to prepare the site for the company's plant.
Sales tax revenues to the city are up 9 percent, housing demand has accelerated and unemployment remains at about 6 percent.
Alexandria's mayor, Ned Randolph, who was elected to his third term last year, said that although he had looked at the closing of the base with "fear and trembling," in the end, the community benefited. "It will bring diversification to our economy," Mr. Randolph said. "Look what can happen when you have only one employer in a community. Now we're growing."

A former office building was used for a magnet school. (Photographs by Alex Brandon for The New York Times)(pg. B7)

HEADLINE: Pataki Ally Carves Niche In New Republican Order

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
In Joseph L. Bruno, in line to become the new majority leader of the State Senate, voters will hear a more conservative voice in state government than they are used to, from a man who says he will question everything from welfare to environmental regulations in the name of cutting spending and taxes.
But in an interview yesterday, he sought to send messages of both conciliation to New York City, concerned that it might bear the brunt of spending cuts, and determination to carry out what he sees as the fiscal mandate of his fellow Republican, Governor-elect George E. Pataki, a colleague in the Senate. 
 "One of the things we have been doing wrong is smothering business, overregulating business, treating business as if they were the enemy and as if it were some kind of sin to show a profit," said Mr. Bruno, 65, of Rensselaer County, who founded a profitable telecommunications business. "We have to change the attitude of government toward business."
Two days after a coup that elevated him to his new post, he said he spoke yesterday to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and assured him that New York City would not be shortchanged in state aid. Yet in the next breath he complained that the city sucks up a disproportionate share of Medicaid and mass transit money.
"I heard him say New York City is the capital of the world," he said of Mr. Giuliani, with whom he said he plans to meet soon. "I agree, and together we have an obligation to be as helpful and supportive as we can to support New York City.
"But there are limits to everything you do -- you have to act within reason."
Mr. Bruno, who has served in the State Senate for 18 years, said he planned to carve out an independent role for himself and the house's 35 other Republicans, even though he was the choice of Mr. Pataki to succeed Ralph J. Marino, the Oyster Bay Republican who had tried to block Mr. Pataki's run for Governor.
He said he and Mr. Pataki agreed on most issues -- though Mr. Bruno opposes abortion rights -- but said he would advance his own ideas when he sees fit. For example, he said he might favor greater cuts in business taxes if that would stimulate the economy more than the full plan advanced by Mr. Pataki to cut personal income taxes 25 percent.
"Generally I'd say philosophically we are in about the same place on most issues, but we may be taking entirely different approaches in terms of how you get to the end result," he said. "Believe me, we will be independent. I don't say that in a defiant way, but we're not going to rubber-stamp for anybody."
In some ways, Mr. Bruno will hold less power than Mr. Marino did: He is likely to be overshadowed by the new Republican Governor, whereas Mr. Marino held virtual veto power against a Democratic Governor and the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
Mr. Bruno said he expected to work well with Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, whose role in Albany has grown as the governorship switched parties. Mr. Bruno said the two had worked cooperatively on legislation involving insurance several years ago, and said he hoped to continue that relationship.
"He has a real sense of obligation to do what's right for the most people and I respect that," he said. "We'll have some serious differences, but I like him."
On the issues, Mr. Bruno seems likely to challenge many of the spending assumptions of a government controlled for 20 years by Democrats. He said his first priority would be to include tax cuts in next year's budget, despite the projected $4 billion shortfall. To prevent local property taxes from rising as the state makes cuts, he said he wants to ease up on services that the state requires localities to provide, especially in Medicaid, welfare services and education. He said he could not yet provide specifics.
He said he wants to jolt New York's economy to new life and is looking to lift regulations on businesses, particularly in the area of environmental conservation, though he could face difficult battles with environmental lobbyists. "All of us are conscious of the fact that you've got to protect the environment for future generations," he said. "But a lot of us are also conscious that we have to work and eat today. There has to be some balance and some logic. The pendulum has swung too far."
On crime, he said he supports the death penalty and wants harsher sentences for repeat violent felons. But he also said the state must look deeper into prevention and alternative programs for prisoners who are nonviolent or addicted to drugs. "Building more prisons is not the answer," he said, adding that doubling the state's prison capacity in the last 12 years had not made a real dent in crime.
Mr. Bruno said voters had sent a message to Albany for change that he and his colleagues would follow, especially as it relates to cutting taxes.
"They are wanting that," he said. "So those of us who don't relate to the message the people are sending, I don't think they will be in government very long."

HEADLINE: Employers' Survey Sees Job Surge in '95

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The nation's employers plan to add to their work forces in the first quarter of 1995 at the fastest rate in five years, with prospects strongest in the South and Midwest, according to a quarterly survey conducted by Manpower Inc.
The outlook is best for the manufacturing sector, an area that had concerned opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 "On a net basis, manufacturing jobs have not moved south of the border," Manpower's chief executive, Mitchell Fromstein, said, adding that while the trade pact had removed some jobs, it had also created some others.
In the survey of more than 15,000 United States businesses in nine industries, 22 percent of the companies said they planned to increase hiring while 12 percent said they expected a decrease. An additional 63 percent said they would remain at current levels and 3 percent said they were not yet certain.
That compares with 18 percent that anticipated additional staffing a year ago, and 13 percent that planned decreases. The current figures match those of 1989, Manpower, the world's largest temporary services organization, said.
Among manufacturers of durable goods, like appliances, computers and automobiles, 32 percent indicated plans for further hiring, while 9 percent said they would cut their work forces. Of the manufacturers of nondurable goods surveyed, 24 percent said they planned additional recruiting and 10 percent said they would reduce payrolls. The wholesale and retail trades, usually highly negative after the holiday, are far more upbeat for the coming quarter, Manpower, which is based in Milwaukee, said.
"Normally, there's a net reduction in the number of employees in the post-holiday season," Mr. Fromstein said. "This year, it looks like those hired for the holiday won't be leaving, or if they do, they'll be replaced."
The employment drought in the construction industry that usually accompanies the onset of winter should be less severe than usual, as commercial construction that was postponed during the last few years resumes, Mr. Fromstein said.
Twenty percent of the construction companies surveyed said they would hire more workers, although another 20 percent said they intended to make further cuts. Only three times since 1977 has the survey reflected a positive net hiring strength in the first quarter, the company said.
In the transportation and public utilities sector, Manpower said that the sluggishness that began in late 1990 will remain for at least three more months. Job prospects in this field are bleak, although substantially better prospects exist in the South, Manpower said.
Jobs in finance, insurance and real estate will be difficult to find in the Northeast, where much of the industry is centered.
Conditions have improved in the education sector, but progress has been slow, Manpower said. Adjusting for seasonal variations, prospects remain at the level that existed throughout last year.
In the public administration sector, prospects exceed those of last quarter and last year, as governments show signs of long-term improvement in hiring activity.
 The services industry, which has shown little first-quarter progress in recent years, is expected to improve, Manpower said.

HEADLINE: Bane of Insurers: New Ailments

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Companies that sell disability insurance to individuals are reporting a sharp rise in claims for certain ailments that were little known 10 years ago, leaving the insurers with losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. The companies are also reporting a big increase in claims by doctors, once among the most prized of the insurance industry's clients.
In response, insurers are adopting new strategies, from offering less generous benefits to pulling out of the business. Three million people, many of them self-employed, are covered by individual disability policies that generate annual revenues for insurers of $3.5 billion. Group disability policies offered through employers cover 48 million more people, and offer more limited benefits. 
 The ailments with by far the biggest increases in claims in the last five years, according to the UNUM Corporation of Portland, Me., are carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that often arises from prolonged use of computer keyboards, and Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, which produces symptoms of fatigue among otherwise healthy people. The number of claims has also doubled for back and disk pain, psychiatric problems and AIDS.
Among some doctors, like emergency room physicians and anesthesiologists, disability claims have grown to more than twice the expected rates. Unlike claims involving heart attacks, cancer or accidents, where the disability is clear, "we are now seeing more and more claims for nervous- or mental-type situations or muscle and soft-tissue disorders that are very hard to evaluate," like back pain, said Stephen B. Center, executive vice president of UNUM, the fourth-largest disability insurer for individuals. "There are a lot of claims from physicians that fall into a gray area."
Insurance executives say that as with any group, some of the claims by doctors amount to fraud. But they see other reasons as accounting for most of the increase. They note that many doctors today are more likely to want to stop practicing when faced with ailments they used to work through.
"Too many white-collar workers have learned to use their disability insurance as a substitute for unemployment compensation" or as a retirement plan, said Eric N. Berg, an insurance analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. "In an age of myriad new diseases, the product simply no longer works."
Last week, the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company of America -- the second largest in the business with a 17 percent share of the individual disability insurance market -- presented its sales force the outlines of its new policies.
The new approach, which is expected to take effect early next year, calls for benefits to be reduced when a disabled person earns money from a new job. In addition, those filing claims would be required to join a rehabilitation program. Currently, the company said, some disabled individuals have increased their income by finding new jobs in other fields while continuing to collect their disability benefits in full. Others have made no effort at rehabilitation.
On existing policies, companies have little choice but to lick their wounds. A typical middle-aged doctor paying less than $5,000 a year in premiums for a disability policy can collect $15,000 a month and cost the insurance company a few million dollars.
For every 1,000 people they cover, insurance companies expect no more than three or four to file for disability each year. Even a slight increase in claims can create sizable losses. But in some states -- Florida for example -- doctors who bought policies in the late 1980's have been filing claims this year at nearly five times the expected rate, according to the Paul Revere Corporation, an insurer based in Worcester, Mass., that is the leading issuer of individual disability policies.
The spreading losses among disability insurers can be traced back to the 1970's and 1980's, when claims were much lower and intense competition for what looked like a lucrative business led many companies to offer more liberal terms. One change that greatly favored customers was a gradual shift toward policies with premiums and benefits that could not be changed. Another was to pay benefits if a disabled person could not work at his or her own occupation but was working at some other job.
Within the disability business, doctors were long considered the cream of the crop.
"It used to be that we treated physicians more liberally than any other profession because doctors were highly motivated people who would die at age 72 after delivering a baby that morning," said Charles E. Soule, chairman of Paul Revere, which holds more than 18 percent of the market.
But now, Mr. Soule said, "we see a different retirement ethic, particularly in warm-weather climates like Southern California or Florida."
As more doctors see a shrinking in their autonomy, and perhaps in their earnings, "the temptation is there" to file a disability insurance claim, said Dr. Joyce A. Majure, a general surgeon in Lewiston, Idaho. "It's a societal attitude that is creeping into the medical profession."
The leading disability insurers are approaching the problem of rising claims in different ways. One of them, the Equitable Companies, last year transferred the administration of its individual disability business to Paul Revere.
Provident was the hardest hit of the disability insurers. It took a one-time after-tax charge against its earnings of $275 million in October 1993. Until its new policies are approved by state regulators, the company said, it will continue selling old-style policies but without an option for lifetime benefits. The maximum payment for doctors and dentists will be $10,000 a month and benefits will be limited to two years onclaims arising from mental or nervous conditions or drug and alcohol abuse.
At Paul Revere, where 70 percent of the business is from individual disability policies and doctors account for more than a fifth of the company's individual business, the value of claims rose in the third quarter to 85.3 percent of premium revenues, from 72.6 percent a year earlier. Pretax profits for the individual disability business fell 53 percent to $14.8 million.
In response, the company dropped some sales agents whose customers generated too many claims and will begin offering new policies that are less expensive but also more restrictive. Even more striking, no physicians in Florida or California will be allowed to take out policies that provide full benefits if they are unable to work in their own occupation, even if they are working at some other job. The same ban will apply to anesthesiologists, emergency room physicians, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons and thoracic surgeons in the rest of the country.
In the future, Paul Revere expects to introduce policies that allow insurance companies to adjust premiums within a specified range, much as interest rates move up or down within a specified range on an adjustable-rate mortgage.
Mr. Soule added that benefits might be reduced in the future, so that a disabled person could collect payments only up to a specified age or for a limited period. Most policies now offer benefits to age 65, or in some cases for life.
Offering new policies with adjustable prices, which is already standard on group disability policies sold to employees of companies, is not a complete solution, Mr. Soule said, because of the delays and expense of getting state regulators to approve changes. In addition, he said, adjustable prices do nothing to reduce the frequency of claims.
To reduce claims, insurers are scrutinizing applicants even more closely about their income, the stability of that income and their medical history. Insurers already reject or impose restrictions on as many as 2 of every 5 individual disability applications, compared with less than 1 in 10 life insurance applications.
The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee also says its individual disability business has been hit with higher-than-expected claims. So far, however, it is not losing money.
Robert E. Carlson, executive vice president, said Northwestern had increased prices in states with excessive losses, like California and Arizona. But it has cut prices in states with low losses, like Iowa and Minnesota. The company has also reduced the amounts it will pay in benefits.
UNUM announced earlier this month a $125.1 million after-tax charge to increase reserves for losses it expects in its individual disability business.
Mr. Center of UNUM said individual disability policies to be introduced next year would include shorter limits on payments for those able to work in other occupations. The company will also offer incentives for rehabilitation and have adjustable prices. In addition, UNUM plans to combine disability policies with long-term-care policies that promise to pay nursing-home expenses for the elderly.
Despite all the problems, insurance companies are still attracted to the disability business. With the life insurance market saturated, disability insurance still offers the potential for growth because only two in five workers are covered.
Insurers want to lure more executives and small-business owners to take out disability policies. Only 25 percent of the nation's 3.4 million small businesses have any kind of disability insurance, while just one in five top executives owns an individual policy. By contrast, 78 percent of all physicians are covered, as well as 68 percent of lawyers and 80 percent of dentists.

HEADLINE: A Generation Transformed -- A special report.;
Women in Their 50's Follow Many Paths Into Workplace

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
They were members of the last generation to come of age before the women's movement took hold in the 1960's. Marrying early and in huge numbers, they had expected not to work. But their lives have played out much differently.
Women now in their 50's have piled into the work force in big numbers in the last decade and a half. Today the college-educated among them are as likely to hold jobs as any group of younger women. 
 The women's movement made work a widely accepted alternative to a life centered on the home. But in many cases, the move into the workplace was not the low-pressure choice that these women would have preferred. While financial pressures have always pushed some women into the labor force, many college-educated women now in their 50's took jobs for economic reasons largely new to their generation -- after divorce left them without enough income, or because a husband could no longer support the family alone.
Whatever the reasons, holding jobs has been strikingly beneficial for many women now in their 50's, to hear them talk. Betty Friedan, author of "The Feminine Mystique," the 1963 book that helped begin the women's movement, agrees. "It used to be that a woman's mental health, having peaked in her 20's, declined drastically after age 40," she said. "But today the mental health of women in their 50's is as good as, or better than, that of women in their 20's and 30's."
About 80 percent of the nearly three million American women aged 50 to 60 who graduated from college are in the work force today, according to estimates based on new data collected by the Labor Department, which has just begun to break down employment regularly by age and education. Nearly three-quarters hold full-time jobs. Both figures roughly match those of any group of younger college-educated women.
Employment among all women in their 50's, educated or not, has also risen steeply in the last decade, to 8.1 million women, or 65 percent of this age group, up from 54 percent in 1984. College-educated women accounted for most of the gain, Labor Department officials assert.
Few women represent the transition into the work force better than Linda Fisher Smith of Amherst, Mass., who did not work full time until she was in her 50's, when she became an executive at a New England museum, a post she still holds. While raising two children, she had accumulated experience as a volunteer and as a part-time entrepreneur -- writing newsletters, for example, and forming with two neighbors a business that helped to organize conventions. She was expanding this business when her husband switched to a new, lower-paying job, and Mrs. Smith's earnings became more necessary for the family. She took a salaried job.
Today, Mrs. Smith, 56, is the family's chief breadwinner, her husband having cut back at his new job after suffering a heart attack. "He is beginning to talk about planning for retirement," she said, "but I am not really ready to."
Today, Mrs. Smith, 56, is the family's chief breadwinner, her husband having cut back at his new job after suffering a heart attack. "He is beginning to talk about planning for retirement," she said, "but I am not really ready to."
Mrs. Smith's situation is not unusual. For many women like her, either their college-educated husbands were laid off or the husbands' incomes stopped rising. Indeed, even as these women gained job experience and their wages rose faster than inflation, the pay of college-educated men in their late 40's and 50's has lost ground to inflation, recent studies show.
At the same time, while the number of women in their 50's in the labor force has risen sharply, the participation rate for men in their 50's has fallen over the last decade by more than two percentage points, to about 83 percent. (The rate for the college-educated among them is higher.)
This age group was also the first to experience a high divorce rate -- more than 30 percent of all marriages. And many divorced women had to go to work.
Most women now in their 50's took the jobs that men let them have -- in personnel, public relations, education, real estate, social services, health care, government and not-for-profit organizations. They have been helped by the fact that the economy in recent years created these types of jobs more frequently than others, in the view of Heidi Hartman, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington.
Affirmative-action programs begun in the late 1960's also helped these women. But many of the 22 college-educated women in their 50's who were interviewed for this article attributed their gains in good part to a flexibility that was forced on them. They had trained for the work force, they said, through years of juggling children, households, graduate school and the occasional work that in many cases later became full- time and absorbing.
The women said they were generally content in their jobs, their satisfaction flowing from work that has social value. They never expected to have the careers and promotions that many men and younger college-educated women struggle for today, they said, and they are not driven now by such ambitions. Sometimes, looking back, they express relief at having avoided the pressures experienced by younger women who work and raise children simultaneously.
"They had no expectations of having careers, and now that many do that is really pleasurable," said Claudia Goldin, a labor historian at Harvard. "They have no expectations of being highfliers."
Not everyone accepts unskeptically so positive an image of women in their 50's. "People have ambitions for positions they think they have a chance of getting," said Cynthia Epstein, a sociologist at the City University of New York. "And many older women think such ambitions for them are pie in the sky, so they avoid them."
What is more, those who went to work after divorce often did not earn the incomes their husbands once provided. In addition, many women in their 50's lack the pensions and Social Security benefits that men their age anticipate after decades in corporate jobs. And women of this age increasingly find that they are not immune to the layoffs that men in their 50's have suffered.
But for Betty Friedan, women in their 50's, whatever their problems, have made a profound breakthrough. "They started out still caught in the feminine mystique," said Ms. Friedan, whose book gave that name to the often-hidden deterrents that kept women out of paid jobs. "Then they went back to school. They took themselves seriously. They tried things they had not tried before. And they broke the feminine mystique."
That is the case for the five women profiled here, whose paths are representative of many college-educated women their age.
 
 
Linda Fisher Smith
From Volunteer To Breadwinner
 For Linda Smith, as for many women her age, the experience she had accumulated as a volunteer and part-time entrepreneur during years of marriage and child-rearing is paying off in a late-in-life career. She is not the lawyer she once thought of becoming. But her job as director of development for Historic Deerfield in Deerfield, Mass., helps keep alive a prominent museum of New England art and history. She raises millions of dollars each year.
Not that Mrs. Smith planned it this way. When her oldest child was born in 1968, "I did not have a career path," she said, although she had worked in advertising and in public relations for five years. "We decided that not only did we want to have children, but I wanted to be home with them."
But in the case of Mrs. Smith, motherhood included writing newsletters for a fee for the Board of Education in Pleasantville, N.Y., in Westchester County. She was also president of the P.T.A., president of the Junior League and president of the board of deacons at her church. "Some people seem to feel 'volunteer' has a negative connotation; it is very positive job experience," Mrs. Smith said.
By 1980, Mrs. Smith and two friends had set up Golden Apple Tours, which coordinated corporate conventions in Westchester, among other activities. "We did not make pots of money," Mrs. Smith said, "but the process of becoming incorporated, developing a marketing plan and pitching ourselves to business was important."
And then Mrs. Smith made the transition into a full-time career. Her husband Hubbard, a Time Inc. executive, left the company and the family moved to Amherst, Mass., where he became an official in the alumni office at Amherst College, his alma mater, at lower pay. Two years ago, after a heart attack, he cut back to three days a week.
Mrs. Smith soon found herself on the payroll at nearby Smith College, her alma mater (class of 1960), helping to raise funds. A friend put her in touch with Historic Deerfield, and she took her present job, with a jump in pay to more than $40,000, more now than her husband makes, from $33,000.
"I want to see if I can do this job successfully," she said, dismissing retirement as way off in the future. "I am drawing on all my accumulated experience and schooling, and I am challenged. I have a lot on my plate, and I find it exciting."
 
Nancy Broadway
Staying Flexible After a Divorce
 Flexibility became a means of survival for Nancy Broadway. At 55, she has experienced many of the ups and downs of women in her age group: divorce, rearing a child alone, a layoff from a good job. Now she is struggling to get back to work, unwilling to give up on regaining her career as a well-paid hospital administrator -- but ready, she says, to take a lesser job, if she is forced to do so.
Divorced at age 30, Ms. Broadway supported herself with a full-time job while rearing a child. Her salary rose through a series of administrative positions to $51,000 a year as associate director of Bellevue Hospital's AIDS program. But she lost that job in February in a management reorganization, her first layoff in nearly 30 years of constant employment. Like so many college-trained women in their 50's, she acted quickly to prepare herself for another job.
Ms. Broadway enrolled for a master's degree in public administration, training she sees as essential in her quest for a job as a hospital or clinic manager. "I am just kicking myself for not listening to my friends, who told me for years, 'Go back and get your master's,' " she said.
After earning a B.A. in English in 1961 at Cornell College in Iowa, she migrated to New York, where she married an actor, Robert Broadway. They divorced in 1969, when their daughter was 3. Supporting her small family kept her at work, first in low-paying theater jobs. "When you are worried about a child and making a living and there is not much affordable child care, that is hard," she said.
She joined Bellevue in 1977, at age 38, running various clinics and programs. By then, Ms. Broadway had remarried, and her new husband, who now earns $22,000 a year as a receptionist, helped her raise her child, "taking some of that pressure off," she said.
Having come out of college with a Peace Corps mentality, as Ms. Broadway puts it, she tries to help others even as she hunts for a job for herself. She is the unpaid vice president of Forty Plus Inc., a support group mostly for men over 40 who are out of work.
As for herself, contingency plans are beginning to form. "I love supervising and working with staff," she said. But if such a job does not materialize, she would take a lesser one. "I cannot imagine myself out of the work force."
 
Nancy Noeske
Choosing a Career Over Marriage
 A small number of women in their 50's climbed almost to the top in corporations. But in most cases, experts say, they felt they had to make a choice between marriage and career. Nancy Noeske, 57, said she made this choice, devoting her energy to a career. Even so, she was in her 40's when she finally began her corporate climb.
When she graduated in 1959 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a minor in education from Marquette University, Ms. Noeske tried to land a job as an industrial chemist. But like so many women her age, the job she got was as a teacher.
But Ms. Noeske advanced quickly, soon becoming the head of a junior high school science department and also a science teacher on educational television. By 1976, she had taken charge of most special education programs in the Milwaukee system. And along the way, she picked up a Ph.D. in physics and another in education.
"Every three years I got a new job, and each time I had a personal decision whether to take the job or get married," Ms. Noeske said. "I thought that if I got married, that would be my career. It was not that I did not want to marry -- it was just that the decisions came just when better jobs came along. And in those days, you did not try to juggle both."
In 1979, Charles McNeer, chairman of Wisconsin Electric Power, hired her at $35,000 as an assistant vice president. He was seeking a woman executive with a science background. Her job was to improve customer relations at a time when rates were rising and customers were angry. She succeeded and by the mid-1980's she had risen to vice president, one of only 10 among 5,000 employees. Her salary reached $130,000.
Then, in 1991, Mr. McNeer retired, and early this year Ms. Noeske also did, after clashing, she said, with the new chief executive. "My glass ceiling was that I did not get to be a senior vice president or president of the company," Ms. Noeske said. Her annual pension from the electric company is $73,000. But unwilling to leave the work world, Ms. Noeske soon became a consultant to the Milwaukee School Board, at $80,000 a year.
 
Carolyn Johnson
A Late Degree Changes a Life
 Low-level jobs were the lot of many women now in their 50's who had skipped college. So in midlife some got bachelor's degrees. Carolyn Johnson, 52, was one. And, she says, college gave her entree to a career at a living wage.
She had come to hate the typing and clerical jobs she held after graduating from Prospect High School in Brooklyn in 1961. Then a break came. She rose a notch to become an interviewer of job applicants in a hospital personnel department.
"I was let go for lack of experience, and that hurt -- that was a trauma," Ms. Johnson said. Still, she had glimpsed work that pleased her, and soon she was interviewing applicants at a small temporary-help agency that friends had set up. But the agency failed, and Ms. Johnson fell back into another typing job.
"That is when I came to realize that I was at a dead end and I needed that piece of paper -- a college degree -- and I also realized that I would have to work for the rest of my life to support myself," Ms. Johnson said. A single mother, she had a son to support.
So she enrolled in college in 1976, when she was 34, first at a community college and two years later at Hunter College in Manhattan. She went to school full-time, working as a waitress on the side, not trusting herself to hold an all-day job and take courses at night. "I did not have enough drive for that," she said.
With her degree in hand, at age 38, she became a counselor at a Bronx drug rehabilitation center, then at an organization that counsels women, many of them addicts. There were long hours and the pay, $14,000 a year, was not much more than she had made as a typist. But Ms. Johnson was in her chosen field, and in 1983, at age 41, she got an $18,000-a-year job as a counselor at a Y.W.C.A., where her salary rose to $33,000 before she left this year.
That is what she earns today as senior counselor for the Women's Center for Education and Career Advancement, a not-for-profit operation in Manhattan. "I counsel women on changing jobs," she said, "and I help them build their self-esteem."
 
Arlene Leibowitz
Pioneer Juggler Of Job and Home
 A few women in their 50's, pioneers really, behaved as younger women now so often do -- juggling marriage, jobs and children. Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the Supreme Court justice who is now 61, was in this mold. So was Arlene Leibowitz, a labor economist at the Rand Corporation in Los Angeles.
Mrs. Leibowitz, 52, was married in 1965, at age 23, while earning a Ph.D. in economics at Columbia University. "It was amazing that my husband and I found each other and that we have stayed married," she said, "but I was not slowed down by kids early."
Her first job, as a Ph.D., was as a researcher and assistant professor at Brown University, where her husband, Robert Leibowitz, had become a biology professor. Their first child, a daughter, came in 1972, and Mrs. Leibowitz, then 30, returned to work six weeks after the birth.
"I got a lot of comments from older relatives, like 'Why would you want to have a baby and then leave her?' " she said. "It was seen as aberrant behavior, and now it is seen as normal behavior; but now it is putting too much of a burden on women to return to work so soon."
Mrs. Leibowitz did give ground to her husband's decision to become a doctor and give up teaching. He entered medical school at the University of Miami, where Mrs. Leibowitz -- having given up her career track at Brown -- secured a full-time appointment as a visiting professor and researcher. Only after the birth in 1977 of their second child, also a daughter, did she cut back for five years to 20 hours a week.
That year, the family moved to Los Angeles, where Dr. Leibowitz practiced medicine and Mrs. Leibowitz joined Rand, first as a part-time researcher and since 1982 as a full-time staff economist, now earning more than $50,000 a year -- enough over $50,000, she says, to be comparable to what male economists in her field are paid. The family no longer needed the income by the time Mrs. Leibowitz returned to work part-time, but Mrs. Leibowitz, having acquired so much education and experience, could not bring herself to focus "on diapers and mundane things."
Still, she departed from the norm for her generation. "It was clear in my mind that I would search for good, full-time child care until I found it," Mrs. Leibowitz said. "Women do not feel as guilty about that today, and they can't, knowing they will have to be in the labor force most of their lives."
 
 
 
WAGE GAINS AFTER COLLEGE
 The median weekly wage of working women in their 50's, whatever their education, is about $415. That is not as high as the median earnings for women in their late 30's and 40's, which reaches $450 in some cases. And no group of women matches the $560 median weekly wage of men in their 50's, the Labor Department reports.
But college-educated women in their 50's apparently earn more than any group of younger women, says a study by the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. It found that the older women, if they worked at least half-time, earned a median hourly wage of $19.55, adjusted for inflation, compared with $17.61 for college-trained women in their 40's. Still younger women, whatever their education, earned less.
But the college-educated women in their 40's earned more, in dollars adjusted for inflation, than the older women did when they were in their 40's, a decade ago. The implication is clear. With promotions and raises still ahead, the college-trained women in their 40's undoubtedly will earn more when they reach their 50's than women currently in that group do, said Gregory Duncan, a Michigan labor economist.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
A Balanced Budget: What One Looked Like

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
In mid-January, the House of Representatives will vote on a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget. It will be, said Newt Gingrich, "our first smashing victory" -- a safe political forecast.
But then what? If the Senate also passes the amendment, and it is ratified by 38 states and eventually becomes part of the Constitution, can the budget actually be balanced by early in the next century, as the Republicans promise? And can they do it, as they say they can, without raising taxes or touching Social Security and with cuts in the military budget that are much smaller than those President Clinton has proposed? 
 Theoretically, yes. Politically, the prospects are daunting.
In March, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a senior Republican from upstate New York, proposed such a budget in the House.
Only 73 representatives voted for it; 342, including Mr. Gingrich, who will presumably be the next Speaker of the House, voted against the proposal.
The Solomon budget is important because it is the only existing program-by-program, line-by-line accounting of how the budget can be balanced and meet the Republican specifications of no additional taxes whatsoever, no reduction in Social Security and military cuts only half as deep as the Administration's.
An examination of the fine print shows what making the necessary spending cuts would entail. These cuts, beginning in the 1995 fiscal year, would total about $700 billion over five years and well over $1 trillion over seven, and even further cuts would be required if the Republicans followed through on another promise to reduce taxes.
"It's painful as hell," Mr. Solomon, who is expected to be the new chairman of the Rules Committee, said in an interview last week. "But eventually you have to stop talking about it in the abstract and begin dealing with the details."
Under the Solomon plan, Federal spending on the environment, for instance, would be reduced by 44 percent, on agriculture by 72 percent, on foreign aid by 32 percent, on transportation by 29 percent, on community and regional development by 40 percent and on energy by 65 percent.
Medicare and Medicaid spending would be cut by much more than $100 billion over the next five years, with upper-income retirees having to pay much more for their health insurance than they do now and poor people restricted to certain doctors and hospitals.
Spending on income security, a budget category that includes welfare and almost all other programs for the poor, would be reduced by $150 billion over five years, or about 12 percent. At the same time, spending on job training would be cut in half. And states would have to pick up part of the cost of food stamps and a larger share of foster-care expenses.
Financing for most programs, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's fingerprint laboratory, would be cut back.
Dozens of Federal activities would be abolished altogether, including economic aid to Russia, almost all agriculture price supports, construction of a space station, grants for new sewer systems, subsidies for Amtrak operations and air service to isolated communities, economic development grants to local governments, the national service corps and the legal services corporation.
"This is a radical restructuring of Government, cutting or eliminating wholesale huge swaths of the Government as we know it," said Martha Phillips, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group devoted to eliminating the Federal budget deficit.
The Concord Coalition has its own plan to balance the budget. But it would require wealthy Americans to pay more in taxes and forgo some of their Social Security benefits, provisions opposed by the Republicans who control the new Congress.
Speaking of the Solomon plan, Ms. Phillips said, "This is what you're going to have to do if you're going to balance the budget without Social Security or revenues."
Gene Sperling, a White House economic adviser, said the spending cuts in the Solomon plan would be "Draconian for poor children and go far beyond what many Americans think would be reasonable."
But Mr. Sperling said Mr. Solomon deserved credit for "putting forth a line-by-line, item-by-item plan like this" rather than "hiding the details till later."
Mr. Sperling and others in the White House are afraid of a Republican gambit that could put President Clinton at a serious political disadvantage at the beginning of the next election year.
Their fear is that Republican lawmakers will begin the march this year toward the goal of a balanced budget by voting for strict, unrealistic annual ceilings on overall Government spending beginning in the 1997 fiscal year without ever saying what should be cut or abolished to get spending below the limit.
Then the President, in the 1997 budget he must send Congress in early 1996, would have to be the first to say officially what steps would be needed to keep spending under the ceiling. If he did not do so, Republicans could attack him in the election campaign as a free-spender. And if he did suggest such spending cuts, the Republicans could criticize him for slashing popular programs.
In preparing his plan, Mr. Solomon made a few concessions to practical politics. For example, dairy price supports would be retained, while all other agriculture subsidies would be abolished. Why? Perhaps because Representative Solomon's constituents in the Hudson River Valley produce more than one billion pounds of milk a year, making the dairy industry one of the most important in his district.
Many other proposed cuts would surely run into roadblocks. For example, Mr. Solomon would turn over the Government's air traffic operation to a private corporation, a shift President Clinton supports, that would save the Government more than $30 billion over five years.
The main opponent of such a step is the private plane industry, and as long as Senator Bob Dole of Kansas is the majority leader, the air-traffic-control measure is bound to face trouble. Beechcraft, Cessna and Learjet aircraft are manufactured in Kansas, a state the spokeswoman for the General Aviation Manufacturers Association calls "the capital of our industry."
When the Solomon budget was debated on the House floor in March, a supporter, Representative Dick Zimmer, a Republican from New Jersey, declared, "Those of us who advocate a balanced budget have a moral responsibility to get specific and show how it can be done."
But even Republicans voted against the measure by 2 to 1. Mr. Gingrich said at the time that he opposed it because he did not want to draw attention from a Republican alternative budget that would have reduced the deficit by only a fifth as much as the Solomon plan. The Republican alternative was rejected by a vote more or less along party lines.
Mr. Solomon said last week that many more lawmakers would have supported him if his proposal had stood any chance of being approved. Since it was sure to be defeated, he said, many colleagues saw little point in casting a vote to cut popular programs that could be used against them by groups of constituents, say by farmers, in their campaigns.
But Mr. Solomon said that even next year, with Republicans in control of the House, he was not sure he would get more than about 150 votes on his side.
Moreover, the prospects for finding enough spending cuts to balance the budget may be made even harder under Republican rule than they were this year. That is because the Republicans in the House pledged in their "Contract With America" to approve tax cuts, ranging from a lower capital gains rate to a $500 tax credit to parents for each child.
They would cost the Government more than $200 billion over five years in lost revenue, and require that much more in lower spending.
Scott Hodge, a budget expert at the Heritage Foundations, a research institute here that serves as a sort of brain trust for conservative Republicans, said tax reductions were an essential sweetener to get the public to swallow the bitter pill of deep spending cuts.
"Without tax cuts, taxpayers will not bite the bullet because they see no benefit to themselves," he said.
But Mr. Solomon, unlike most other Republicans in Congress, insists that the medicine should be taken first. "The deficit is the most serious problem facing the country," he said. "I would like to cut taxes. But only after we get the deficit under control."

HEADLINE: Serbs' Gains Irreversible, Perry Asserts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today that the Bosnian Serbs had demonstrated their superiority on the battlefield and that the Muslim-led Bosnian Government would be unable to reverse their gains even if NATO warplanes came to its aid.
"The Serbs have occupied 70 percent of the country," Mr. Perry said. "There's no prospect, as I see it, of the Muslims' winning that back." 
 Mr. Perry's statements, made on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," reflect the Pentagon's deep-seated fears about being drawn into the Bosnian war.
They also come as Clinton Administration officials are beginning to rethink their Bosnia policy after failing to win allied support to protect Bihac from Serbian nationalist attacks. A meeting of Cabinet-level officials on Bosnian and other European security issues is scheduled for Monday.
The Administration has supported a peace plan, accepted by the Bosnian Government, that would reduce the Serbian-held territory in Bosnia to 49 percent. But the utility of the plan has been called into question by the ability of the nationalist Serbs to continue to assault Bihac without further military reprisals from Western nations. After NATO air strikes last week, the Serbs have continued their attacks without any NATO response.
The Administration is faced with trying to think of new ways to apply military and economic pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, continuing to back peace talks despite the dim prospects or writing off the negotiations as a losing proposition and distancing itself from the crisis.
American officials say the Administration is likely to continue to support the diplomatic effort to achieve a cease-fire in the name of NATO unity while trying to fend off Congressional pressure to lift the arms embargo unilaterally and take tougher action. The embargo, which applies to all sides in the war, has favored the better-armed Serbs.
Central to the dispute between the Administration and lawmakers are assessments of the military abilities of the Muslims and the utility of air power. Mr. Perry addressed both today, apparently in an effort to shape the public debate.
During the last year, air power has been one of the few means that Washington has had to try to influence the situation.
And as the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs advanced on Bihac during the last 10 days, the Administration pressed for the expanded use of air power to defend the town, including the adoption of a weapons exclusion zone and looser rules of engagement that would allow attacks on ammunition and supply depots outside the immediate vicinity of Bihac.
But Washington was rebuffed by Western European nations, who are fearful of ethnic Serbian retaliation against United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia and appear to be calculating that additional compromises by the Muslims are the best way to end the the two-and-a-half-year-old war.
With the Western European countries blocking expanded air strikes and the Pentagon wary of deeper involvement, Mr. Perry sought to dampen Congressional pressure for unilaterally lifting the embargo.
Instead of talking about military pressure that the allies could apply if the ethnic Serbs continued their attacks, Mr. Perry made the case against significant military intervention.
"NATO is prepared to respond with air strikes if the United Nations asks them," Mr. Perry said. "The United Nations has not been asking for air strikes, and therefore we are really powerless to conduct air strikes to influence that situation."
Mr. Perry added: "I should say, though, that even if they were to ask for air strikes, the air strikes cannot determine the outcome of the ground combat."
Mr. Perry said that only the politically unpalatable deployment of hundreds of thousands of allied troops would reverse the Bosnian Serbs' gains and impose a peace.
"The Serbs are in control of the situation," Mr. Perry said. "They have not occupied Bihac, and it seems clear that they could occupy it if they decide to do that."
But Congressional critics say Mr. Perry has presented a false choice of doing nothing or sending hundreds of thousands of troops.
They say that if NATO's air strikes have been of limited effectiveness it is because they have been carried out under severe constraints. NATO air strikes last week were limited.
"I think we have a complete breakdown of NATO," Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican and prospective Senate majority leader, said today. "We have U.N. vetoing of targets -- driven by the British and the French."
Senator Dole added: "Let's lift the arms embargo. And let's at least let the Bosnians defend themselves."

HEADLINE: As Envoy, Crowe, the Old Sailor, Navigates Rough Sea

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
For someone who has logged 47 years in the military and become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff through a combination of intelligence and shrewdness, William J. Crowe Jr., the Ambassador to Britain, would seem to be the right man in the right place at the right time.
Ambassador Crowe took up his first diplomatic post six months ago, a time when differences over the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina began to strain American-British relations and raise fundamental questions about the performance and purpose of NATO, which was deploying forces outside its treaty area for the first time. 
 If anything, those strains have worsened now that the Clinton Administration, fulfilling a commitment made to Congress, has stopped enforcing the arms embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces in their war with the Bosnian Serbs. Recent NATO air strikes against Serbian targets in Bosnia and Croatia have shown that the alliance can function operationally but have not removed the underlying political divisions.
The unenviable task of explaining the complexities of the United States policy to its staunchest ally has fallen to Ambassador Crowe, a large bear of a man, 69 years old, who uses his military expertise and reputation as a straight-talking down-home Oklahoman as a shield and rapier in the diplomatic thrust and parry. Mr. Crowe, who retired as an admiral in 1989 after four years as head of the Joint Chiefs, is well acquainted with the Mediterranean, having served among other incarnations as Commander in Chief of United States Naval Forces Europe and NATO Commander in Chief for Southern Europe.
"I am not so sure I know what to do about Bosnia," he said in an interview in his office overlooking the falling leaves of Grosvenor Square.
"There are no blinding insights. If there were, they would have come up by now and we wouldn't have all the arguments. What we are really talking about is a damage-limitation exercise as to what is the best answer to keep the killing down and the controversy down while we seek for time and solutions."
The difference in views between the French and British on one side and the United States on the other comes in part because the European countries have troops on the ground in Bosnia as part of the United Nations peacekeeping force. If they are seen as partisan, they would come under attack and have to be withdrawn. But it also comes from a fundamentally different perception of the conflict: the European countries look at the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and see a quagmire of countries with ancient enmities committing atrocities on all sides. Washington sees it in starker terms of right and wrong.
"I have an obligation," Ambassador Crowe said, "to try to explain what I think the American perception of Bosnia is -- essentially that it's a European problem but also that the Bosnian Serbs are the aggressors, that we have countries here, no matter how fledgling they are, that have been recognized and now the aggressors are trying to upset those boundaries and have committed a lot of atrocities.
He continued: "Whether it is right or wrong, many Americans believe that the embargo unduly helps the aggressor against the aggrieved, and that we would be better off -- though it would not be a perfect answer -- if we lifted the embargo and, in the trite phrase, made the playing field level."
At the same time, Mr. Crowe (rhymes with now) tries to be a transmission belt in the other direction, communicating European views to Washington so that the Clinton Administration is aware that its decisions on Bosnia can adversely affect NATO and relations with Britain, France and Russia.
"It would be unfortunate if we make some decisions back in Washington about Bosnia because we looked at Bosnia as just a discrete problem, and then discover that our decisions have a much wider impact which we didn't like or desire. And that's a possibility."
The job of go-between is not an easy one for the Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Sometimes, British diplomats have suggested privately, Mr. Crowe is left hanging by his own Administration without enough timely information to explain a policy and damp down concerns over newspaper headlines.
Two weeks ago, for example, when the report leaked in Washington that the United States would no longer allow its ships to intercept arms shipments bound for Bosnia under the NATO operation, the American Ambassador met with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd but was not able to explain in detail how the decision would be carried out and how it might affect intelligence-sharing.
Asked about the matter, Mr. Crowe said, "I would have preferred to have had more advance notice."
The Ambassador won his post as a payoff for a political debt owed by President Clinton. His endorsement of Mr. Clinton during the campaign was crucial because his blessing, as a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs appointed by President Reagan, helped to undercut the notion that Mr. Clinton's past as an objector to the war in Vietnam would make him unacceptable to the military.
Though he replaced a highly popular career diplomat, Raymond Seitz, the fact that Mr. Crowe is a political appointee carries an advantage. "He can pick up the phone if he wants to and call the White House -- he has a direct line," said Jon Snow, a journalist and anchor on Channel Four news. The Ambassador said he called the President sparingly, only when a crisis demanded it.
So far, he has cut a wide swath through London, emphasizing in speeches that the "special relationship" between London and Washington is alive and well, using Will Rogers-type witticisms to warm up after-dinner audiences and impressing newspaper editors with his bluntness and insight.
"He takes a bit of getting used to -- that Oklahoma style of grunting first and speaking later," said Bill Emmott, editor of The Economist. "I've learned you just have to be silent and then the words start coming."

HEADLINE: Bitter Feud Is Dividing Sandinistas

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MASAYA, Nicaragua, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Beneath the single, flickering bulb in his medical examination room, Dr. Rommel Martinez Cabeza spoke over the din from the street a few feet away. "After all the deaths we suffered and we caused, and after all we thought we had achieved, I find myself again in the business of subversion," he said.
For Dr. Martinez it is the most painful sort of subversion. He is working to undermine an organization he says he used to believe was as necessary as the medical profession: the Sandinista National Liberation Front. 
 For nearly a generation, the movement of intellectuals, Marxists and the poor, along with many of the country's middle class and wealthy, has been Nicaragua's most important political, social and even cultural force.
But today the Sandinista Front is riven by deep differences over basic policies and humbled by the bitter accusations that its most prominent leaders make against one another.
As it begins to split apart, the front, by far Nicaragua's largest political organization, reflects and at the same time contributes to the continued splintering of a society still recovering from a decade of civil war. Those in charge of the party apparatus are the most hard-line of its members, while the moderates are left to search for an organization that can represent them.
Many in the front, like Dr. Martinez in this historic Sandinista stronghold, are trying to undermine support for the hard-line leaders and persuade party members to form a new movement. In this effort, they have the implicit support of several members of the front's ruling body, the National Directorate, as well as many prominent Sandinista leaders.
The reasons for the division have to do with politics and ethics.
Dr. Martinez, who in 1963 joined other Masaya high-school students in early efforts to overthrow the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, most objects to the wealth many Sandinista leaders have accumulated. "We made a revolution to make all Nicaraguans equal, but it turned out that the leaders made themselves rich, and the people have been forgotten," he said.
After leading the movement that overthrew General Somoza in 1979, the Sandinistas took charge of the Government. For the next decade they clashed with the United States over their increasingly socialist policies and closed political system. The United States armed and trained thousands of rebels -- the "contras" -- who tried to oust the Sandinistas by force. The effort failed, but in 1990 the Sandinistas were voted out of office, and now say they support democracy and free-market economics.
While in office, top Sandinistas took over properties and businesses that many ordinary Sandinistas say allow leaders to live well, while the rest continue to live in the misery that they expected the revolution to end.
The most notable defector is Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who served as Vice President in the Sandinista Government. He said the front was controlled by extremists whose unwillingness to compromise with other political parties precluded winning elections. (The next national elections are expected in 1996.)
"The most radicalized members are the ones in the important positions," he said. "They are the ones who will decide on the candidates, and I'm sure those candidates will not be acceptable to the rest of society."
Those in charge of the Sandinista Front respond that their critics simply no longer wish to continue the fight to help Nicaragua's poor, and are too quick to give in to political pressure on matters like agrarian reform and privatization of nationalized companies.
Victor Hugo Tinoco, a Deputy Foreign Minister in the Sandinista Government, and other leaders of the orthodox wing dismissed the dissidents by saying they were never true Sandinistas.

HEADLINE: Take a Realistic Look at Some of These Women on Welfare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Congress and some of the people it represents must have got the idea somewhere that poor women and their children are using too many tax dollars, that their families are too large, they're having too many children, they don't want to work, and they are living comfortable lives off the rest of us out of laziness. 
 The need to devalue these women and children seems stronger than a desire to know the facts.
The typical family size of recipients of aid to families with dependent children is one mother and two children (slightly less than the average family size in the United States). The Federal Government spends about 1 percent of its budget on this assistance, while states pay about 3 percent. (In 1991, the savings and loan bailout cost $130 billion, compared with $23 billion for welfare.) As opposed to living comfortably and getting more money for more children, the average welfare recipient in 1991 was getting about $367 a month, and benefits remain well below the poverty level.
Most of those calling for "reform" haven't even met any of these women or their children.
I work for a union, which means I work with working people. There aren't enough jobs in our society for all. Some people will sometimes be employed and sometimes not. It is, unfortunately, part of my job to insist that people apply for welfare after their unemployment or disability benefits run out.
The women, often with desperate tears, ask if there is any other work available through the union, another employer, another benefit, anything else they can do. I just say, "No, keep calling your agency for work, or wait for Social Security disability."
Against their wishes and needs, I help them with the public assistance application or send it in the mail or insist they go to the food stamps office. I have heard how badly they are treated at the welfare offices.
Newt Gingrich suggests indirectly that when people lose their jobs, they should also lose their children to orphanages. Does he think that would be better for those children?
If our country is structurally designed to keep a percentage of the population unemployed, we should redesign it or face the consequences, not scapegoat and punish the victims further.

Undemocratic Vistas

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
What caused the Holocaust? Was it Fascism, ushered in by the collapse of the Weimar Republic? Was it that Germanic fixation on racial superiority and "purity"? Or was it the Enlightenment and those dirty rotten idealists, Hobbes, Rousseau, Franklin and Jefferson?
Blame the Enlightenment and you've chosen the right villain -- at least in the eyes of Leo Strauss, the political philosopher who held court at the University of Chicago through the 1950's and 60's. Strauss's students had to gasp when he said that Hitler had sprung full blown from the Enlightenment presumptions that all people were created equal and that society was better governed by reason than slavish devotion to tradition. Leo Strauss contended that the Philosopher Kings (himself included) were born to rule, servants were born to serve and that only disaster came of letting the rabble get above its station. 
 Strauss, then, was unapologetically elitist and anti-democratic. His ideas have survived him and crept into vogue in American politics. Those ideas were carried forth mainly by writers, economists and jurists who were schooled at Chicago. The economist Thomas Sowell, for example, quotes Strauss almost verbatim, when he argues that social problems are "unsolvable," and that it is unnatural to try.
Robert Bork, a Nixon henchman during Watergate and a failed candidate for the Supreme Court, also claims Strauss as an influence. So do I, but in a different sense than my distinguished schoolmates. I began my doctoral studies at Chicago in 1973, the year of Strauss's death. Black and poor, the first in the family to graduate from college, I was well aware of my resemblance to Strauss's notion of rabble that didn't know its place.
His best-known disciple was the University of Chicago professor Allan Bloom, who gave Strauss's elitism its most public airing yet in the mega-selling book "The Closing of the American Mind." The book parrots Strauss's view that higher education ought to be the province of the golden few and likens the student takeovers of the 60's to the sacking of the universities by Hitler's book-burning Brownshirts. The book offers the vantage point of the Philosopher King staring down his nose at the commoners. Its commercial success helped to beget the political correctness hysteria and a stream of tracts best characterized by William A. Henry's "In Defense of Elitism." Elitism hardly needs a champion. With poverty deepening, middle-class income stagnant and college tuition spiraling out of reach, class barriers are doing just fine on their own.
Strauss appealed to the conservative elite because he viewed the status quo as an expression of divine will. He appealed to college professors because he cast them romantically, as front-line warriors battling barbarism. He appealed to political ideologues because he provided "wedge issues" that pit the electorate against itself, specifically the privileged against the poor.
Conservative think tanks flocked to the party. Their enthusiasms have paid off. The precepts of the Enlightenment that Strauss so heartily despised are under daily assault. The notion of a permanent "underclass" that is beneath democratic grace is one example. The idea that some Americans are less entitled to opportunity for "genetic" reasons is another.
The way we now talk about crime is the most troublesome of all. Once it was taken as common sense that good influences transformed wayward children into good citizens. These days, it is just as common to hear it asserted that prison and the death penalty are the only crime prevention. Lurking here is the presumption that criminals are born, not made. Why not fry them at the outset, before they break the law?
This dark view of human potential is poised to become a central feature of this country's social policy. One antidote is fresh and frequent reading of the Declaration of Independence, the Enlightenment's most profound document, the place where rule by a privileged elite was resoundingly rejected, and the worth of even the lowest born was asserted as a matter of national principle. In brutal times like these, that commitment cries out to be reaffirmed. BRENT STAPLES

Free Trade and Job Losses

 BODY:
Almost 1,500 jobs in the region have been lost as a direct result of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect Jan. 1, according to the Labor Department. New York State has seen about 10 percent of the job losses attributed to the accord nationwide. In general, trade experts credit the strong domestic economy with holding down the job losses in the United States. Workers who lose their jobs because of the free-trade agreement can receive benefits under the Labor Department's Transitional Adjustment Assisitance Program. It provides re-employment services, job training and income support beyond unemployment benfits.

HEADLINE: Mystic Aquarium to Hire Leading Oceanographer

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 28

 BODY:
With aquariums around the country expanding to capitalize on growing public interest in the underwater world, Connecticut appears to have staged a major coup, recruiting Dr. Robert D. Ballard, the current superstar of deep-sea exploration, to open an institute at its aquarium in Mystic.
Dr. Ballard, best-known for leading expeditions that discovered the wrecks of the Titanic, the Bismarck and the Lusitania, plans to establish a center at the aquarium devoted to educating the public about the deep sea and to oversee the building of a submarine simulator that will allow the public to go on mock dives of 12,000 feet. Visitors will witness real undersea expeditions and speak to the scientists conducting them through live video and telephone hookups in an auditorium. They will also see more conventional exhibitions. 
 "The public knows more about Mars and Venus than they do about the deep sea," Dr. Ballard said today. "This will be the only aquarium that will have the capability to comprehensively show the ocean beneath 200 feet."
The Mystic Marinelife Aquarium and state officials spent the last six months trying to lure Dr. Ballard, who has spent the last 27 years at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass. Today, the effort appeared to be almost a done deal, as the State Legislature approved a $30 million package to expand the aquarium. It includes a $15 million state grant, and $15 million in state-sponsored bonds.
About $12 million will be used to construct a building for Dr. Ballard's Institute for Exploration, with the remainder devoted to other new projects at the aquarium.
The state money and bonding are contingent on the aquarium's raising $15 million in private funds, a goal that officials at the aquarium, a nonprofit research and education organization, were optimistic they could meet.
The effort is part of a two-pronged economic plan for southeastern Connecticut, a stronghold of the submarine-building industry that has fallen on hard times with the end of the cold war. State officials and business leaders are trying to turn around the economy there by promoting tourism and encouraging businesses related to undersea research and development.
About 750,000 people visit the aquarium annually, making it Connecticut's second-biggest tourist attraction after the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard. Aquarium officials are predicting that the expansion will attract an additional 250,000 visitors. Besides the boost to tourism, state officials also envision that Dr. Ballard will work closely with some of the local companies trying to develop practical applications to undersea exploration, like mining and farming.
The move represents a significant career change for Dr. Ballard, a marine geologist. While he is well-known for his best-selling books and National Geographic television specials on his explorations, much of his time has been devoted to pure research intended mainly for the scientific community.
Dr. Ballard said he would continue to launch expeditions, with voyages planned to search for ancient ruins in the Mediterranean and Black Seas.
The new building housing his center is projected to be opened in 1998, and Dr. Ballard said he would retire from Woods Hole in 1997, at age 55. He said he expected to spend the rest of his career at Mystic.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Norway's Vote Helps Raise The Dollar Against the Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reached a 12-week high against the German mark yesterday, drawing strength from higher United States interest rates, a stock rally and the possibility that Norway would reject membership in the European Union.
The Norwegian referendum on joining the European Union was undecided by the time foreign-exchange desks in New York ended trading yesterday, with exit polls showing the "no" vote slightly ahead. Currency traders interpreted the vote as a sign of underlying friction in Europe that could hurt its economy and the mark, the Continent's dominant currency. The vote, when finally tallied, rejected joining Europe's union. 
 "Every time we see less unity in Europe than expected, it's going to help the dollar," said Hubert Pedroli, manager of foreign exchange trading at the New York branch of Credit Suisse. "It's going to play against the European currencies against the dollar."
The dollar's strength against the mark was clear at the outset of trading and surged into most other European currencies after early Norwegian exit polls were reported.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.5670 marks, its highest level since Sept. 2, before settling at 1.5668 marks, up from 1.5598 marks on Friday. So far this month, the dollar has gained 4.5 percent against the mark.
The dollar was also stronger against other European currencies, rising to 1.3285 Swiss francs, from 1.3207 francs on Friday, and to 5.3765 French francs from 5.3540 francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5625 from $1.5630. The dollar rose to 6.8462 Norwegian kroner, from 6.8361 kroner on Friday.
The dollar closed at 98.67 Japanese yen, down 0.11 yen from Friday.
Higher interest rates in the United States bond market, along with a rally in the stock market, also lent strength to the dollar, traders said.
Yields on the 30-year bond rose to 7.98 percent, from 7.94 percent on Friday, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 31 points, its second consecutive rally after a large drop last week.
The higher yields made dollar-denominated assets more attractive, and the improvement in stock prices created a demand for dollars needed to purchase stocks.
In other currency trading, the dollar gained against the Canadian dollar as a result of weakness in the Canadian bond market, traders said. The Canadian dollar fell to 72.60 United States cents from 72.69 cents.

HEADLINE: A Growing Rage in Bay Ridge;
Change Breeds Violence in a Once-Quiet Corner of Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON and JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
David O'Connor describes his father's occupation as "drinker." He says that the man exited his life by his second birthday and that his mother, a diner waitress, let him take to the streets of Brooklyn at age 14.
Now 15, he sleeps in a small bedroom in a group home. He has been arrested once, charged with stealing a car, and is described by administrators at Telecommunications High School in Bay Ridge as a troubled student. Born to an Irish Catholic family, he says he has no great use for religion. 
 Instead, David has joined the Netas, a largely Hispanic gang that tends to draw its members from neighborhoods far removed from the middle-class streets of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.
"They have given me a right way of living," David said of the Netas. "I'm trying to choose a life of living. I'm against abuse. And there is abuse going on all over."
His decision to join the Netas made David O'Connor a rarity, but there are hundreds of other teen-agers in southwest Brooklyn who share his isolation, anger and confusion, and who are bringing an edge of fear and violence to one of New York's more stable neighborhoods.
In recent months, two brutal attacks have put a spotlight on the violence. In one case, an Ecuadorean immigrant was beaten to death by a group of high school students in Dyker Beach Park, and in another, a transit police officer was attacked and left for dead after he confronted some unruly teen-agers drinking outside his building in Bay Ridge.
The attacks reflect what law-enforcement officials say is an alarming increase in both random and calculated violence in otherwise stable white enclaves of the city.
In Queens, for instance, prosecutors and the police have identified loose gangs of white middle-class teen-agers who talk about respect, loyalty and family and who engage in everything from innocuous rowdiness in local parks to the menacing of unsuspecting neighbors, often immigrants or minorities. The assaults are often brutal, and the presence of guns is on the rise.
Many residents contend that the attacks in southwest Brooklyn are unrelated aberrations. But for others, they share some traits with the 1986 racial killing in Howard Beach, Queens, and the 1989 murder of Yusuf Hawkins, a black teen-ager, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
"The common thread is hate," said the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes.
And in Bay Ridge another thread is economics. The effects of a persistent recession, say the police and others familiar with the neighborhood, have blurred the lines between the poor and the middle class. This has contributed further to the sense of disenfranchisement and anger among the neighborhood's whites, whose mean income falls below that of both blacks and Asians.
"A lot of these kids lead really depressed lives," said John Trimmer, a youth officer in the 68th Precinct. "In East New York, you look around and the whole neighborhood is down. But the kids in Bay Ridge look out the window and see half-million-dollar houses and they know they are the have-nots."
White working-class teen-agers walk the streets of Bay Ridge at all hours, often in groups that the police, with an almost embarrassed shrug, call "marginal gangs." They stand together outside Fort Hamilton High School and in neighborhood parks, smoking cigarettes, drinking beer and talking acidly about their perpetual war of wills against their parents and the police.
Some have razors tucked in their wallets, and brag that a mere whistle can produce other armed friends. They talk about the importance of "protection," though when pressed, they are often unable to articulate what or whom they need protection from.
"I hate when cops are in places where they shouldn't be," snapped Manuela Allegretti, a cherub-faced 15-year-old, as she puffed on a cigarette outside school one recent afternoon. "I don't need gangs right now. But I got my backup."
Of course, the world of Bay Ridge has not been wholly reinvented. It remains handsome and reasonably safe -- the 68th Precinct has reported only four homicides this year and ranks 25th of the city's 76 precincts in felonious assaults. For many residents, car thefts are the biggest problem.
 
Change Goes Deeper Than Demographics
 But in dozens of interviews, Bay Ridge residents, educators, counselors and law-enforcement officials talked about a demographic, economic and even spiritual altering of their neighborhood -- a shift that has left an increasing minority of teen-agers dislocated, disaffected and dangerous.
"The kids are about defiance, and they have this fearlessness," said Officer Margaret Bonica, a youth officer at the 68th Precinct in Bay Ridge. "And they have all this hate. It emanates from them. They don't even know why or against what. But they don't want a part of the world the way it is."
Alcohol, they say, has ravaged the neighborhood as crack has other parts of the city. Economic hardship has hit households and commercial strips. Families have splintered. And despite the neighborhood's Irish and Italian roots, the Catholic Church is a mostly phantom presence for many, its influence diminished by declining resources, membership and relevance to the young. Local counselors talk of teen-agers coming in to centers for aid and listing "pagan" on medical forms as their religion.
Michael Vitale, a senior at Xaverian High School, a private Catholic school for boys on Shore Road, said he lived in Coney Island before Bay Ridge, and has had guns pointed at him in both neighborhoods.
"I know the kids who beat up that cop, and if it had happened a while back, I could have been one of them," he said. "Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, you see craziness taking over kids of all neighborhoods. I don't see a way of figuring out how to stop it. Not our generation."
The hardening attitudes among young people have created a number of paradoxes for the neighborhood. Though its politically conservative voters helped elect Rudolph W. Giuliani as Mayor, some now find themselves lamenting his budget cuts, saying the youth programs that are being eliminated could help keep their children off the street.
And in their urgent search for help, some elected officials and educators have turned to the directors of the Crown Heights Youth Collective for ideas on how to provide direction and guidance for their children.
"There are the same conditions here now as kids face in Harlem or elsewhere," said Neil Kenney, a Fort Hamilton teacher who was born and raised in the neighborhood. "Bay Ridge has created its own monster."
 
With Diversity Comes Hostility
 Since World War II, Bay Ridge has been an almost exclusively white, middle-class Irish and Italian neighborhood, its large Catholic parishes anchors of resources and direction, its streets graced by some spectacular homes with views of the Narrows and rows of limestone homes that for generations housed large, seemingly close-knit families.
Today's Bay Ridge is increasingly populated by immigrants -- Arab, Russian, Asian and Hispanic. The 1990 census found that nearly 8 percent of Bay Ridge is Asian and 6 percent Hispanic, and that its total minority population of 17 percent was double what it was in 1980.
"There is always that dimension of hostility when a neighborhood goes through change," said Councilman Sal F. Albanese, who represents the neighborhood.
It is that kind of hostility that the police say led to the killing of Manuel Aucaquizhpi, a 40-year-old Ecuadorean immigrant who was the last one left in Dyker Park one evening last September when a group of white teen-agers, enraged over an earlier dispute with other Hispanic men, stumbled upon him.
The police say the neighborhood boys, shouting anti-Hispanic epithets, took their fury out on Mr, Aucaquizhpi with baseball bats and table legs. He died several days later.
Late one night several weeks later Sgt. Louis Cosentino of the transit police confronted a group of teen-agers who were making a racket under his apartment window. They responded with a beating that broke more than a dozen bones in his face, and left him, his pants half off, bleeding in the street.
 
Anger and Despair, Soaked in Alcohol
 The police and other experts say that money and alcohol are at the heart of much of the anger and disaffection. The average household income in Bay Ridge is $42,000, yet more than half the households have two or more family members working full-time.
Ten percent of the neighborhood lives below the poverty line. The service jobs at institutions like Metropolitan Life and the Equitable Life Assurance Society, once large employers of Catholic high school graduates, no longer exist.
One administrator at a Bay Ridge mental health clinic said more than half of the center's 1,000 neighborhood clients use public assistance to pay for the services.
When youth officers knock on the doors of teen-agers who have got into trouble, they are often surprised by the destitute quality of the apartments, units that from the street appear well-kept.
"They are finding that the homes are a mess, utterly filthy," said Capt. Robert Mescolotto of the 68th Precinct. "One officer said he felt like he was back in the South Bronx."
And alcoholism is commonplace, experts say. Third Avenue, one of the neighborhood's main commercial strips, is filled with bars, with one on nearly every corner. The 68th Precinct, in response to the beating of Sergeant Cosentino, has begun an aggressive crackdown on teen-agers caught with beer, and on the stores that sell to them.
"Based on easy observation, the problem with alcohol in Bay Ridge is phenomenal," said Officer Trimmer. "It's Bay Ridge's drug of choice." Mr. Albanese says there is not a single formal alcohol or substance-abuse treatment center in the neighborhood.
The police say the problems with alcohol have contributed to the creeping nihilism among some youths. They hang out in groups on the street or in the parks, calling themselves "United States Criminals," or "The 69th Street Troopers," confronting the police who constantly tell them to move along or face arrest.
 
A Common Lament: Where Can We Go?
 Parents and children alike complain that there is simply nothing else for them to do. "I would appreciate it big time if they would open something here for older kids," said Carolyn Pohore, 18, on her second try as a senior at Fort Hamilton. Miss Pohore, who admits that she has struggled with alcohol, has lived with her boyfriend's family and found herself drawn to the area parks when exhausted or bored.
"The cops try to split us up, but where are we going to go?" she asked. "Your friends are No. 1, they are your family, and so the cops are the enemy because they are trying to break up your family."
Educators and social workers say that many of Bay Ridge's children come from families as badly fractured and troubled as in poorer neighborhoods.
"Our kids are going home to what is often a hell," said Kevin Cormack, an administrator at Xaverian. "There are single parents, without father figures, or with alcoholic, dysfunctional fathers. The hell for the kids is isolation."
And though the Catholic Church once played a strong role in Bay Ridge in helping troubled families, today it is a fading presence. The churches have had their own funds depleted, and their numbers of priests reduced. Many stable families who formed the backbone of local parishes have left, for Staten Island or New Jersey, while those who remained are often less committed to the church.
Of a group of nearly three dozen Xaverian students interviewed, none said he had a meaningful relationship with his local church.
Our Lady of Angels, one of the largest Bay Ridge parishes, has seen its number of families sliced to 3,500, from 6,600 a decade ago. Of the four major parishes in Bay Ridge, only St. Anselm's has sustained its elementary school population. At St. Patrick's, for example, the school population in 1983 was 559; a decade later, it was 272.
"The parish structure now doesn't touch kids at all," said Msgr. Howard Basler, the former pastor of St. Andrew's in Bay Ridge. "The institutions of the church are incapable of extending the arm to the young people that they did a generation ago."
The sense of emptiness among the neighborhood's teen-agers, then, is deep and pervasive.
"I don't know that the kids in Bay Ridge, and I mean kids from all classes, are malicious or psychopathic," said Sal Ferrera, president of Xaverian High School. "But they are quite different than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and there's a growing minority that are deeply troubled.
"If we don't do something, we're in for more trouble."

"Some of them think it is ridiculous or disgusting. I didn't think people my age could think that way, but in this Irish preppy area, they don't go for that." "To me, the trouble is all about the deterioration of the family," said Michael Vitale, left, a senior at Xaverian High School, of the trouble in Bay Ridge. "That gives kids freedom. But you have to be able to handle it. For kids who don't have money, they try to get power other ways, try to get respect. They want to feel invincible." He sat with his friends Ryans Calmont, center, and Paul Stumbo, a sophomore, who said: "How can I come off the street, and then go to church and hear about loving your neighbor? It doesn't make sense for my life." (Photographs by Linda Rosier for The New York Times); "I know there is anger out there.

And there are hard-core kids in Bay Ridge. They try to act so hard. They can't get approval. They want power, they think it feels great. I saw it in the neighborhood I live in, and you hear about violence in public schools. But It's coming to Bay Ridge. It's coming here. Someone has to find a way to stop it." -- SAMMY FRANCOIS, senior, Xaverian High School. (Steve Berman for The New York Times); "Most of the time there is something holding you on, something making you care, but a lot of kids I know, they have lost hope. No one my age is happy. I know people who are so completely miserable, they have bad lives, there is something wrong, they are convinced that something is going to hurt them. Some of them don't feel thay can handle even the smallest tasks." -- JESSICA HAFFEY, sophomore, Fort Hamilton High School. (Steve Berman for The New York Times)(pg. 1)

HEADLINE: Hospitals' New Creed: Less Is Best

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Duke University Medical Center, one of the nation's most prestigious academic hospitals, has long operated dozens of specialized laboratories, two for tests involving the thyroid gland, for example, and one for the pancreas.
Now Duke is combining 79 specialty labs into 4 general units, eliminating the need for 100 of 450 technicians. "There is no reason to have a lab for every gland in the body," said Dr. Mark Rogers, chief executive of the hospital in Durham, N.C. 
 Hospitals like Duke's are rushing to cut costs and improve their efficiency amid growing pressures from health insurance plans to reduce costs. Sometimes big numbers are involved. Duke, for example, plans to eliminate 1,500 of 6,500 hospital jobs and cut its $500 million budget by $65 million a year.
The streamlining at hospitals could be a good thing for patients eager to be treated considerately and released as soon as is safely possible. For instance, hospitals are moving to trim unnecessary repetitions of tests and questions, rescheduling tests to shorten nerve-racking waiting time, personalizing bedside services by assigning a handful of aides to tend to each patient (as opposed to dozens) and cutting red tape at every step, from the admitting office to departure from the hospital.
Before checking out, patients are asked to fill out satisfaction report cards, which hospitals then use to improve services and sell themselves to insurers, employers and the community.
But the cost-cutting can go too far. Dr. Manuel Lowenhaupt, a consultant in Boston with the William M. Mercer consulting firm, noted that on the West Coast there had been drastic reductions in the number of surgical procedures as insurers switched to a system of payment that rewarded saving money rather than spending it. "Those results make me very scared," he said.
The hospitals have been forced to act because of a change in the way they are compensated.
Traditionally, hospitals and doctors were rewarded for keeping the patient in the hospital longer or performing more tests and surgical procedures, because health plans paid them for each service performed. But a growing number of insurers now pay a flat fee for treatment of a particular ailment, no matter how many nights in the hospital and how many tests are done. The change is particularly tough on academic medical centers, where costs are higher.
Some health maintenance organizations in the West and other places where managed care is strong have gone even further. The hospital is paid a set monthly amount for each health plan member, whether or not the person requires hospital care.
Under these arrangements, hospitals lose money on patients who stay too long and get expensive services.
That is where the obsession with efficiency comes in.
John Nackel, a principal with Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm, said cost-cutting measures often included shedding unneeded employees and standardizing the buying of supplies.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center recently chopped $75 million from its $750 million hospital budget, a down payment on $180 million in planned cuts over the next three years. In an earlier consolidation, the medical center trimmed $100 million a year by merging four hospitals and dropping 41 vice presidents and many other executives.
Among other economies, Pittsburgh will soon close two of its five CAT scanning units, eliminating 7 of the 15 scanner technicians on each shift.
For many hospital executives, the changes have required a big adjustment. "I was trained as a cost-unconscious physician," said Dr. Loren Roth, a vice president at the Pittsburgh medical center, which is noted for pioneering organ transplants and also for charging the highest prices in the region. "Now, with managed care, cost is considered in every decision."
In other streamlining moves, clerks and nursing assistants in the Pittsburgh medical center trauma unit were trained to do each other's work, eliminating 3 of 10 positions. The kidney transplant unit rearranged its routine so that most patients go home in 14 days instead of 19, returning for monitoring.
The University of Michigan Hospitals are squeezing $60 million from the annual budget of $600 million. Ellen Goucher, senior associate director, said the hospitals used principles adapted from the Ford Motor Company's quality program.
Teams of doctors, employees and financial experts study each unit in a process called continuous quality improvement. For example, the groups found a way to cut the average time patients spent in the admissions office to 10 minutes from more than two and a half hours.
The Michigan medical center also saved $3.3 million by switching from expensive drugs to lower-cost equivalents and reducing doses to standardized levels.
Smaller, independent hospitals are also streamlining.
The Brooklyn Hospital Center reduced its costs per patient by cutting the average stay by 17 percent, to 6.5 days, largely by eliminating waiting time for X-rays and other tests.
Patients with the same disease were grouped together. Cancer patients, for example, could then be tested in their rooms or just down the hall, saving the time employees had spent moving them around the building. Physicians got test results quicker, often shortening stays.
Some employees were retrained. Oscar Velez, formerly a dietary aide who delivered meal trays, now helps take care of a dozen patients. "We do the cleaning, take care of the room, feed the patients and transport them for tests," his partner, Damon Ellis, said. "Patients get used to a familiar face, and we make sure they are comfortable."
The Sentara Health System in Virginia transformed a $2.5 million annual loss to a $1.8 million surplus at Norfolk General Hospital last year. The process of billing 300 insurance companies was streamlined. The average bill now goes through 25 steps, down from as many as 125 before.
Sentara nurses cut an hour and 15 minutes each shift from the time they were spending on record-keeping. Nurses no longer write a report on the patient's breakfast, bath and other routine events. Temperature, pulse and vital signs are briefly noted on a printed chart. "Now the nurse writes down only something that is out of the ordinary," said David Bernd, executive vice president of Sentara.
Many hospitals are investing in computer programs to save on paperwork as they monitor patients and costs. Dr. Jason Rosenbluth, a securities analyst in San Francisco with Volpe, Welty & Company, said hospitals spent $2.5 billion on software alone last year. He projects an increase to $6.5 billion by 2000.
Hospitals desperately need to estimate their costs accurately under managed-care contracts, which typically make the hospital responsible for any cost overruns, said Lawrence J. Frye, president of Iameter Inc., a hospital consulting firm.
Making better use of computers already on hand is often a first step. The medical center in Pittsburgh had 1,000 software programs, now reduced to 300, and "there was not one hardware system we didn't have," said John Paul, executive vice president.
Pittsburgh recently pulled together an integrated system that makes radiology and laboratory results available on line, speeding diagnoses and getting patients out faster. And in a step toward electronic medical charts, almost all records of intensive-care patients are now on line in the trauma, liver-transplant and coronary units at Pittsburgh.
LDS Hospital (formerly Latter Day Saints) in Salt Lake City is even farther along that path. All orders for drugs and laboratory tests, the results, patient histories, and nurses' notes are on line at every bedside. Only the physicians' progress notes are lacking.
LDS said it saved $1.1 million a year, or about $10 a patient, after physicians began consulting a computer program that helped select the most cost-effective antibiotic. The program displays the patient's symptoms and lab results as well as the hospital's experience with treating that type of infection and the prices of similar-acting antibiotics.
Dr. Brent James, head of research of Intermountain Health Care, a 24-hospital group, said it planned to spend $50 million to expand the computer system beyond LDS, its flagship, to eight more hospitals.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT STAGES SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR TRADE ACCORD

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
President Clinton opened the White House this morning to a delegation of Republicans for the first time since Election Day to rally support for the global trade pact whose fate will be the first test of the bipartisanship on which he now must rely.
With the lame-duck Congress back in town to vote on the trade agreement, opponents of the accord were waging last-ditch efforts to block it, contending it could harm American workers and undermine United States sovereignty. But they conceded that they lacked the votes in the House, which takes up the measure on Tuesday. And Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, predicted that the measure would win a comfortable victory in the Senate as well when that body votes on Thursday. 
 Mr. Clinton's declared purpose in gathering the lawmakers, as well as former Cabinet members and five Nobel laureates, was to call attention to the number of prominent Americans from both parties who support the accord. But the East Room pageant also served as a remarkable window on Washington and its new ways.
There in the front row where members of Congress were renewing acquaintances, the broad grins on the faces of men like Representative Dick Armey of Texas, who is likely to be the next majority leader, distinguished Republican from Democrat. At Mr. Clinton's side on the stage was James A. Baker 3d, the Republican lawyer, diplomat and strategist, who appears to be preparing his own bid for the White House.
And among the crowd, all that had changed could be measured in the stoic expression worn by Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington as he stood to acknowledge an ovation offered in tribute to a career that ended with his defeat at his constituents' hands on Nov. 8.
Now that Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, has given the trade agreement his blessing, it appears almost certain to clear Congress, and the President and his Republican guests were plainly enjoying their chance to show common cause on an issue that Mr. Clinton said "bulldozes differences of party, philosophy and ideology."
Among those who spoke before Mr. Clinton, James C. Miller 3d, the budget director in the Reagan White House, said that "if there's anything we Republicans and Democrats ought to be able to agree on," it was the trade accord.
But behind the White House's trumpeting today of trade-pact endorsements from two former Treasury Secretaries, three former Presidents, four former Commerce Secretaries and all 11 former budget directors was a recognition that opportunities for future collaboration may be rare.
Aides said today that, to help guarantee that the agreement was not sidetracked again, Mr. Clinton had invited 75 House members from both parties to join him for breakfast at the White House on Tuesday. They also said that as early as Tuesday he may hold his first post-election meeting with Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican who will be the next Speaker of the House and who has given his support to the accord.
Even though Democrats still hold majorities in both Houses of the lame-duck Congress, the large number of liberal Democrats opposed to the trade pact means that to get the measure approved, the White House must rely on the same kind of support from Republicans that it will need beginning in January, when that party takes control of Congress.
Apart from an expected joint effort to give the President the power to veto budget items one by one instead of rejecting an entire bill, White House officials acknowledged that they were hard pressed to identify an issue on which the President and Republicans were likely to work hand in hand.
Mindful of the discord that may lie ahead, Mr. Clinton injected a hint of urgency into his comments today as he warned lawmakers against postponing action once more on the agreement, whose benefits he said would include an increase in the income of the average American family. "We have to do it now," he declared. "We can't wait until next year. We don't want to litter it up like a Christmas tree and risk losing it."
The pact would expand the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to include farming and lower most tariffs by an average of one-third.
In addition to Mr. Armey, the Republican members of Congress who joined the President, half of his Cabinet and several Democrats this morning included two prominent conservatives, Representatives David Dreier of California and Jim Kolbe of Arizona, who beamed almost constantly as they greeted one another and accepted Democratic congratulations.
And beyond Mr. Baker and Mr. Miller, the more than a dozen former Republican officials who filed in to show their support for the accord included Carla A. Hills, the trade representative under President George Bush; Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser under Mr. Bush and President Reagan, and even veterans like Herbert Stein, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Nixon.
The Nobel prize-winning economists in the audience were Wassily Leontief, Paul A. Samuelson, James Tobin, Lawrence R. Klein and Robert M. Solow. And while they did not attend, Mr. Bush and former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford all proclaimed their support for the pact in a letter that was read aloud by Vice President Al Gore. Ronald Reagan, the fourth surviving former President, is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and White House officials said his aides had decided not to ask him to get involved in the issue.
Among the opponents of the accord who were working to block it today, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, asked at a news conference whether it was fair to make American workers "compete against a 12-year-old working 12 hours a day for 12 cents an hour."
But proponents like Mr. Baker used their appearances at the White House to compare such doomsaying to what the former Secretary of State called predictions from "the misguided and misinformed," including Ross Perot, the former Presidential candidate, that the North American Free Trade Agreement would lead to a major loss of American jobs.
Like the other Democrats and Republicans who exchanged pleasantries this morning, Mr. Baker and Mr. Clinton appeared gracious toward one another as they sat side by side. But after Mr. Gore noted how happy he and the President had been to see "how much Secretary Baker is enjoying life outside Washington," the Republican could not resist a retort.
"It's always fun to come back to the White House in November," said Mr. Baker, who is trying to decide whether to run for President in 1996.

Strong Economic Signs Drive Bond Prices Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were down across the board yesterday, as the bond market, having benefited from investors' shifting money out of stocks last week, reversed course.
Kevin McClintock, manager of fixed-income portfolios for Aeltus Investment Management Inc. in Hartford, cited reports of October home sales growth and strong Christmas sales as a troublesome twosome for bonds yesterday. 
 In the first of a batch of economic reports expected this week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes rose an unexpectedly strong five-tenths of 1 percent in October to an annual rate of 3.91 million, after dropping a revised 1 percent in September to 3.89 million. Originally September sales were reported as a 1 percent gain.
The 30-year bond declined 14/32 of a percentage point, to 94 18/32 , for a yield of 7.98 percent, up from 7.94 percent on Friday. Shorter maturities also fell in price.
Early reports of a healthy start to the pivotal Christmas retail shopping season put pressure on the market because they were consistent with a moderate upward trend in consumer spending.
"Both confirmed that the economy is still very, very strong," Mr. McClintock said. To bond investors a strong economy translates to a pickup in inflationary pressures, and those pressures point to higher interest rates.
Also, Mr. McClintock added, consumer confidence was strong. "If people have jobs, they will continue to spend money on homes," he said. "They may be smaller, but they're still buying homes."
Last week, with the stock market on the skids, many people shifted money to the fixed-income market. Analysts speculate that economic data coming out this week will be strong, and that will mean interest rates will have to go higher to slow the economy. "I personally think the peak in yields still lies ahead," Mr. McClintock said. He sees the long bond somewhere between 8.5 percent and 9 percent, with the yield curve -- the difference in short- and long-term rates -- flatter than it is now before the Fed is satisfied. A flattening of the curve is generally regarded as a sign that the economy has started to slow.
Yesterday the Treasury sold $27.2 billion in new three- and six-month bills, as the average rate at auction rose a bit. The three-month rate was up two basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- from the previous weekly auction, to 5.40 percent, while the six-month rate was up one basis point, to 5.86 percent.
The early signs of holiday sales matching or even surpassing last year's 6 percent gain helped put a crimp on speculation of a slowing economy. Providing evidence of the strong Christmas retail start, data from Telecheck showed check volume on the Friday after Thanksgiving up 5.7 percent from a year ago, while Mastercard reported charge volume up a sizzling 36.2 percent, in part a reflection of the increased use of credit cards this year.
Traders expect the long bond to top 8 percent this week, with several economic reports due.
Today, the Government will release revised data for third-quarter gross domestic product, or the total output of goods and services.
On Thursday, the National Association of Purchasing Management will publish its November survey of business conditions. And on Friday the key employment report is expected to show the economy added 240,000 jobs in November, up from 194,000 in October.
In the municipal bond market, prices were lower, with investors looking toward higher yields on this week's $2.7 billion of new issues. Yesterday's biggest offering was by Pennsylvania's Intergovernmental Co-op Authority, a $124 million sale of bonds negotiated through Smith Barney Inc.
The bonds were initially priced to yield as much as 7.20 percent for an issue due in 2024, but because of good investor demand the yield was lowered to 7.13 percent. Serial bonds with shorter maturities were priced to yield from 4.20 percent in 1995 to 6.85 percent in 2009.
Because the issue is insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, the financing is rated triple-A by the major rating agencies.
The following are the results of yesterday's three- and six-month bills auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.625	97.037	Discounted Rate	5.44%	5.86%	Coupon Yield	5.59%	6.12%	High Price	98.627	97.048	Discounted Rate	5.43%	5.84%	Coupon Yield	5.58%	6.10%	Low Price	98.625	97.037	Discounted Rate	5.44%	5.86%	Coupon Yield	5.59%	6.12%	Accepted at low price	55%	55%	Total applied for	$48,676,439	$45,273,988	Accepted	$13,641,591	$13,626,613	Noncompetitive	$1,403,659	$1,214,049

HEADLINE: Visa Card Use Sets a Record

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Visa U.S.A., the credit card company, said today that consumers in the United States charged a record $1 billion worth of goods on their Visa credit and debit cards on Friday, surpassing the $800 million in charges on the corresponding day last year.
The day after Thanksgiving is traditionally the holiday season's busiest shopping day. 
 Visa said that for Friday and Saturday combined, the total amount charged by card holders was $1.9 billion, a record for the two days and 24 percent over 1993's total.
Thomas Layman, chief economist at Visa U.S.A., attributed the larger numbers to lower unemployment and increased personal income, which in turn improve consumer confidence.

HEADLINE: Existing-Home Sales Manage Gain

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes rose a slight five-tenths of a percent in October, the National Association of Realtors said today in a report that economists hailed as proof of the economy's resilience in the face of higher interest rates.
The real estate group said sales of existing homes last month reached an annual rate of 3.91 million, up from a revised 3.89 million units in September. 
 "This is remarkable stability considering that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have risen by 200 basis points, and one-year adjustable-rate mortgages have risen by 150 basis points," said Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation.
Although sales were up from the previous month, October sales were off 3 percent from the annual rate of 4.03 million units a year ago.
Also, the October figure was below Wall Street economists' forecast of a 3.92 million annual rate.
Despite October's relative stability, John Tuccillo, chief economist for the realtors' group, said home sales were bound to be affected by the Federal Reserve's most recent interest rate increases.
"Adjustable-rate mortgages will be affected more than long-term rates, but increases in both can be expected," he said.
The Fed engineered a rise of three-quarters of a percentage point in short-term rates on Nov. 15, the sixth increase in short-term rates this year.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was 8.93 percent in October, compared with 8.68 percent in September and 6.83 percent in October 1993.
Economists said a strong job market had partly offset the higher rates; consumers who feel secure in their jobs are more willing to make a major purchase such as a home.
"Higher interest rates are working against the fixed-rate mortgages, but you get some relief from that because people are taking on adjustable-rate mortgages," added Darwin Beck, money market economist at CS First Boston.
The Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported that the share of applications for adjustable-rate mortgages was 34 percent in the week of Nov. 18.
Mr. Sung said that some demand was driven by borrowers who rushed to buy housing before interest rates moved even higher. "When we get numbers for November, I would expect a more meaningful slowdown in existing home sales," he said.
The real estate group previously reported September sales at a 3.97 million annual rate.
The median price of homes -- the midpoint at which half sold for more and half for less -- fell to $107,900, from $108,400 in September. But it was up from $106,600 a year ago.
The supply of homes in October was 5.1 months, down from 5.2 months a month earlier, the group said. In October last year, there were 5.9 months' worth of homes available.
The South led in the number of homes sold last month, at 1.43 million, unchanged from September but down from 1.47 million a year ago. Sales were slowest in the Northeast, where 560,000 homes were sold, unchanged from September.
Average prices were highest in the West at $139,900, down from $146,500 in September and $143,400 a year earlier. They were cheapest in the Midwest, at $86,700, down from $87,100.

HEADLINE: Faster Growth Is Predicted

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The economy is expected to grow more quickly this year than previously predicted, according to a survey of 30 forecasters, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said today.
The quarterly survey of 30 economic forecasters compiled by the Philadelphia Fed predicted that the gross domestic product will grow 3.9 percent in 1994, up two-tenths of a percentage point from their forecast in the last survey. That compares with G.D.P. growth of about 3 percent in 1993. 
 For 1995, the forecasters see G.D.P. growing at 2.9 percent, up four-tenths of a percentage point from the last survey.
The outlook for inflation this year, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, is little changed in the current survey. Forecasters see inflation averaging 2.9 percent this year, unchanged from the previous survey. For 1995, inflation is expected to be 3.4 percent, up a tenth of a percentage point compared with the last survey.

Players Set to Stay Off Owners' New Pitches

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEESBURG, Va., Nov. 28

 BODY:
If this were a lottery, the winning number could be $34,243,314. Or $34,865,920. But major league baseball players won't play either one. They think both are losers.
The players' labor representatives are expected to deliver that message to the owners' negotiating team on Tuesday when they resume bargaining in the dispute that first wiped out the last seven weeks of the regular season, then erased the post-season and now has created chaos in the clubs' off-season planning. 
 They will meet at the Lansdowne Conference Resort in this Washington suburb, a site selected by Bill Usery Jr., the mediator who has been directing the talks at the request of the Clinton Administration.
Members of the owners' committee, who knew the players would not accept either of the proposals they made the last time they met, arrived here hoping the players would have a counterproposal, but the players were not expected to present one. If they formulate a new proposal, they most likely would do it at their executive board meeting in Atlanta next week.
The owners are scheduled to meet next Monday in Chicago, where they are expected to vote on the next step in their labor strategy: declaring an impasse in negotiations and unilaterally implementing their salary-cap proposal as baseball's new economic system.
The owners ideally would like that system in place by Dec. 7, the deadline under the existing system for clubs to offer their free agents salary arbitration to retain rights to them, and if not by then, certainly by Dec. 20, which is the deadline for clubs to tender contracts to all unsigned players. More than 80 percent of the 1,087 players on major league rosters are unsigned.
In the last round of bargaining, 10 days ago, the owners presented the players with a revised salary-cap proposal and a new, alternative plan that would tax total payrolls when they exceed a designated threshold. That the two proposals have the same effect should not be surprising considering the owners' goal: to create a "drag" on salaries and regain control of their player costs.
In a memo to all players last week, Donald Fehr, the head of the union, told his members that the owners' negotiators, in discussing the tax plan, "made it clear that, ideally, no club would exceed the threshold."
Under the revised proposal for a salary cap, the payroll limit for each team in 1995 would be $34,243,314. Under the alternative proposal, the tax-triggering threshold for next season would be $34,865,920. The players believe the tax would be so onerous that clubs would reduce their payrolls to avoid paying it. Thus, they argue, the tax would serve as a cap.
The figures differ slightly because of the way the proposals compute them. Both use a defined gross revenue, based on prestrike projections for 1994, of $1,743,296,000, and the players would receive 50 percent of that sum for all of their costs, including salaries for all of the players on 40-man rosters, bonuses, daily meal allowances and pension and benefit plan contributions.
For the salary cap, the maximum payroll would be determined by taking 50 percent, dividing by 28 for the 28 clubs and multiplying the result by 110 percent. The tax threshold would be determined the same way, except the percentage figure would be 112 percent.
For each $500,000 up to $5 million a club exceeded the tax threshold, it would pay a 1 percent tax. Beyond that level, it would pay 1 percent for each $250,000 increment, with the aggregate tax -- the sum of all of the 1 percents -- being limitless.
A team would pay no tax up to the threshold. But once it went beyond the threshold, the resulting tax would be applied to the entire payroll.
In other words, if the Mets had a total payroll of $34.5 million, they would fall under the tax threshold and pay no tax. But if they then acquired Ken Griffey Jr. in a trade for a collection of minor league players not on their 40-man roster, the addition of Griffey's $6 million-a-year contract would force them to pay a 13 percent tax on their entire $40.5 million payroll, or $5,265,000. Griffey, then, would cost the Mets not $6 million but $11,265,000.
Members of the union's staff spent several days of the past week asking questions about both proposals to make sure they understood all of the nuances and ramifications of the plans. Their increased understanding didn't figure to lessen their dislike for the plans.
The more knowledgeable staff members briefed the other members of the players' negotiating committee this evening ahead of the joint session scheduled for Tuesday.
Members of the owners' negotiating group arrived at the conference center today and met separately with Usery, who also planned to meet separately with the players' committee.

HEADLINE: Astronomy Crisis Deepens As the Hubble Telescope Sees No Missing Mass

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
IN their audacious reach for understanding of the universe, cosmologists often draw back hands that are maddeningly empty. They know, for example, there is more out there than meets the eye. But hard as they try, they are unable to grasp the nature of what lurks in the blackness enfolding the luminous stars and galaxies, that shadowy substance whose gravitational pull must be the organizing force for the evolution and overall structure of the universe.
The abundance of this invisible mass, whatever it is, could dictate the fate of the universe. Unless there is more mass than scientists so far have been able to measure or infer, that fate would appear to be bleak indeed. 
 Over the last two decades, evidence for this missing mass has become overwhelming and always perplexing. The stars and gas that are visible are quite inadequate to produce most of the gravity needed to account for the observed shapes and motions of galaxies. If it were not for huge quantities of some unseen matter, galaxies would not be clustering, as they tend to do, but would be flying off in all directions.
By most estimates, this missing matter constitutes more than 90 percent of the universe's total mass. Scientists call it dark matter, descriptive not only of its invisibility but also of their own mystification.
"It's a fairly embarrassing situation to admit that we can't find 90 percent of the universe," sighed Dr. Bruce H. Margon, an astrophysicist at the University of Washington at Seattle.
Identifying the nature and amount of dark matter is the central problem in cosmology today. It is an obsession of everyone concerned.
Astronomers, for all their sensitive new telescopes looking into the visible and invisible, are dismayed by their continuing failure to observe anything more than a tiny fraction of the total cosmic mass. They keep hoping that a significant portion of dark matter is made of giant planets, faint or failed stars or those powerful gravitational sinks known as black holes -- all the stuff they deal in.
But two surveys by the repaired Hubble Space Telescope, announced two weeks ago, appeared to rule out a favorite explanation of astronomers for the dark matter. They had thought that dim small stars, red dwarfs, might be plentiful enough in galaxies to constitute much of the missing mass. And yet the orbiting telescope, able to detect faint stars 100 times dimmer than those seen from the ground, found that red dwarfs are actually quite sparse, a negligible component of cosmic mass.
This setback has shifted more of the burden of the search from observational astronomers to particle physicists, increasingly important players in cosmology. They seek to explain the universe in terms of concepts drawn from theory, studies of cosmic rays and atom-smashing experiments in gigantic accelerators. They strain to think of solutions to the dark-matter problem beyond the realm of ordinary matter.
Some of the cosmic mass, particle physicists suggest, could be in the form of fast-moving neutrinos, subatomic particles that pervade the universe. They are known byproducts of the Big Bang, the theorized explosive event of cosmic creation, but no one yet is sure if neutrinos have any mass. Much more of the missing mass, physicists think, could be something more exotic and sluggish, which they call cold dark matter. For various theoretical reasons, such weakly interacting massive particles, dubbed WIMP's, could exist in great abundance. But they have never been detected.
This line of investigation could have profound philosophical implications. If most of the universe is discovered to be composed of exotic material never before seen and absolutely unlike the "ordinary" matter of stars, of Earth and of all life, cosmologists point out, the effect on human thinking could be more startling and diminishing than the Copernican revolution, which almost five centuries ago revealed that Earth was not the center of the universe or even the solar system.
For theorists, this is a time of high anxiety. As long as dark matter eludes astronomers and particle physicists, they cannot be comfortably sure of the validity of their most cherished theories. The dark matter question, said Dr. David H. Schramm, a University of Chicago astrophysicist, is "perhaps the greatest mystery remaining in the Big Bang picture of the universe."
By learning the type and abundance of dark matter, theorists could finally solve the vexing problem of explaining how a universe that began as smooth and uniform in all directions, according to the Big Bang theory and some supporting observations, evolved into the large-scaled clumpiness of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. There has never seemed to be sufficient time or mass for such a radical transformation.
But recent maps of the heavens clearly show clusters of galaxies bigger than anyone imagined possible a few years ago. These galactic walls stretch across half a billion light-years. Compounding the problem, the Hubble telescope recently gave a measure of the expansion rate of the universe that implied its age could be as young as 8 billion years, in contrast to previous estimates that ran as high as 20 billion.
Theorists would also like to resolve the dark-matter problem because the ultimate fate of the universe will be determined by how much mass there is.
If there is sufficient mass spread over the universe, the force of gravity will eventually bring the post-Big Bang expansion to a halt and even reverse it, causing a cataclysmic collapse sometimes described as the "big crunch." Or if there is too little mass, the weaker gravitational force would allow the universe to expand forever. Such an open universe would become vanishingly thin, populated only by gas, dust and dark cinders of dwarf stars and gripped by temperatures falling toward absolute zero -- a future characterized as the "big chill." (Not to worry; such dire fates are billions of years off.)
Between these two extremes, there is a more attractive possibility, a condition called critical density. In this case, the mass would be precisely what is necessary to keep the universe in balance between expanding forever and eventually collapsing. Such a critical density, an average throughout space of one hydrogen atom per 10 cubic meters, is usually expressed by cosmologists as omega equals one.
For theoretical and perhaps esthetic reasons, cosmologists have long been partisans of critical density. The bulk motions of galaxies on extremely large scales, associated with unseen masses known as the Great Attractor, and the measured rate at which the universe's expansion appears to be slowing down, cosmologists argue, indicate the cosmic mass is near critical density. And the Big Bang theory seems to demand critical density.
Writing in the October issue of Sky and Telescope magazine, Dr. Schramm asserted: "In the most straightforward Big Bang model, even a microscopic deviation from omega equals one would have had disastrous results early on, at least without some special selective tuning. The newborn universe would have either recollapsed immediately into a Big Crunch or expanded and dissipated so fast that stars wouldn't have had time to form."
In the inflationary model, a 1981 modification of the standard Big Bang thesis in which a brief but dramatic expansion occurred in the beginning, the universe has to have precisely the critical density. Since the inflationary Big Bang is widely supported by scientists because it so neatly explains much else about cosmic history, cosmologists want to believe its predictions of critical density. Otherwise they would have lost even more than their struggle to understand dark matter.
But so far, all measurements of cosmic mass fall well short of critical density, presumably indicating an open universe on its way to the big chill. At best, said Dr. Jeremiah P. Ostriker, a Princeton University astrophysicist, combinations of visible and likely dark matter add up to no more than 20 percent or possibly 30 percent of critical density.
"A lot of people don't think omega equals one," said Dr. Craig J. Hogan, a University of Washington astrophysicist. "They are the empiricists, the observers. They have discovered that there really isn't any evidence for high omega."
Dr. John N. Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., whose research on red dwarfs seemed to limit dark-matter possibilities, put it more bluntly. "I have a feeling that we just need to admit to ourselves that the emperor has no clothes," Dr. Bahcall said of the lack of observational evidence for critical density.
But like many specialists in the dark-matter hunt, Dr. Joel Primack, a theoretical physicist at the University of California at Santa Cruz, is not throwing in the towel. He and colleagues are developing new recipes combining neutrinos and cold dark matter like WIMP's that they say overcome previous objections to such hybrid solutions. Recent Japanese experiments, Dr. Primack noted, provided "wonderful clues" suggesting that neutrinos could well have detectable mass and so could account for some of the missing mass required to add up to critical density.
In simulations by supercomputers, the models with neutrinos alone or cold dark matter alone failed to lead to the construction of a universe looking like it does today. Neutrinos are "hot," in that they zip about rapidly, and could not have coalesced soon enough to have helped form galaxies. Cold dark matter, moving slowly and clumping easily, would have produced too much galactic clustering.
Even mixing the two, usually with about one-third neutrinos and two-thirds cold dark matter, has not passed computer-simulation tests; the hybrids still produce galaxies later in cosmic history than recent observations suggest. Some such mixed dark matter could finally pass the test, but many scientists are uncomfortable with such recipes, which smack of being cooked just for the purpose of crawling out of an observational and theoretical hole.
One of the most encouraging developments, astronomers say, is the growing conviction that neutrinos do have a finite mass. But will the mass be sufficient to account for a major fraction of dark matter?
Astronomers have not given up on finding more ordinary matter that could be part of the dark matter. They continue to search for low-mass stars, Jupiter-size planets and other faint objects, which they think may be littering the outer edges of galaxies. They are taking a closer look at the possibility that lower-mass black holes could play a more significant role in cosmic mass than had been thought.
"If nothing works and omega is not very close to one," Dr. Hogan said, "then we've got to find some way out."
That raises once again the issue of the cosmological constant, a concept invented by Albert Einstein in 1917 and later rejected by him as his "greatest blunder." The idea assumes that energy in empty space might serve as a brake on cosmic expansion. If the value of the constant is reasonably low, scientists point out, it could make up the difference between the observed density of matter in the universe and the critical density so devoutly sought.
Physicists, in this their hour of need, have been re-examining the cosmological constant, finding no known principle that forbids it. Still, it makes them uneasy to be introducing such fudge factors. It reminds scientists too much of the practice of medieval astronomers to correct their Earth-centered view of the solar system by devising more and more complicated celestial mechanisms to explain the motions of planets and preserve conventional wisdom according to Ptolemy, the second-century astronomer.
The turmoil of clashing concepts and the continuing failure to find what most of the universe is made of might be cause for some to question science's faith in the optimistic assumption, first espoused by the ancient Greeks, that the universe is comprehensible. The Greek word for universe became cosmos, meaning order.
But cosmologists insist there is no reason to despair. "It's not frustrating," Dr. Ostriker said of the seemingly intractable problem of dark matter. "It's exciting."
With the greater capacities of telescopes and other instruments, Dr. Bahcall said, "our theories are being asked to fit so much more data than 25 years ago." It is a good sign, he added, "that our simplest models are being stretched and strained -- it means we're going to have new ideas."
The Greeks said the universe was comprehensible; they did not say it was simple.

 Seeing the structure of the universe, astronomers have tried to reconstruct how this structure evolved, based on the assumption that the missing mass exists. The computer model at left assumes the existence of unseen cold dark matter and random overdensities acting as seeds.
 
"In Reality, Structure"
 This map of the nearby universe, based on actual observations, shows massive structures, like the great ribbon of galaxies called the Great Wall in the northern segment. Scientists still hope to explain this evolution in terms of dark matter.

DARK MATTER
 
ORDINARY
 
Machos
MASSIVE COMPACT HALO OBJECTS
 Very faint low-mass stars and planet-size objects (known as Jupiters) made of ordinary baryonic matter (protons and neutrons).
 Found in halos of matter surrounding galaxies, or in clusters of dust and gas coasting through intergalactic voids.
 Baryonic matter should be detectable by existing means. Limited sightings suggest this type of dark matter accounts for no more than 10 percent of the Universe's "missing mass."
 
Black holes
 Collapsed remains of massive stars. Gravitational force so great that no light can escape. Optically invisible but detectable by gravitational influence on nearby matter.
 
EXOTIC

HOT: Fast-moving
 
Neutrinos
 Electrically neutral subatomic particles produced prolifically in theBig Bang. Ultra-smallj in mass, perhaps as small as a trillionth oif a proton. Traveling at about the speed of light, they are found just about everywhere, inconcentrations of about 500 per cubic centimeter.
 
COLD: Slow-moving
 
Wimps
WEAKLY INTERACTING MASSIVE PARTICLES
 Believed to exist, but never "seen"; they interact so weakly with matter that their mass has not been measured. Theoretically, they move at a slow pace and exist in very high concentrations - hundreds per cubic centimeter - and may account for a substantial chunk of the universe's mass, if they are ever shown to have a mass of their own.
 
Axions
 Wispy, superlight particles; slow-moving and highly concentrated (400 per cubic centimeter.) Very tiny mass, but measureable; plentiful enough to contribute significantly to the missing mass.

HEADLINE: Redefining Diversity: Biologists Urge Look Beyond Rain Forests

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
BETWEEN the ever-lengthening menu of Rain Forest Crunch snack foods, the Rain Forest Action Network booths at rock concerts and street fairs, and the ubiquitous jungle-themed coffee mugs, T-shirts, place mats, tote bags, wall clocks, umbrellas and jewelry, the American public has been saturated with the message that tropical rain forests are among the greatest and most endangered of the world's natural wonders.
As the generic eco-lecture has it, tropical rain forests like the Amazon shelter enormous numbers of species, bristling with a variety of life forms so rich that science has barely begun to tally up the multitudes. Tens of millions of species of plants, insects, fungi, amphibians, lizards, fish, snails and more remain to be discovered in the Edenic bosom of the tropical rain forests, and yet the forests are being turned into so much kindling and cow pasture before anybody has had a chance to know what is out there. 
 Environmental activists have succeeded in adding the term biodiversity to the common lexicon, and it has been identified above all with the tropical rain forests. Save the rain forests, the reasoning goes, and you will save a bigger proportion of the earth's biological offerings than if you preserved any other habitat or stretch of terrain. As a result of such arguments, the tropical rain forests receive a leopard's share of conservation dollars.
Now, however, a growing number of ecologists and biologists are suggesting that there are other ways of calculating biodiversity than through a simple species score card. They argue that many of the species in rain forests are closely related to each other and hence not as indicative of true diversity as it appears on first blush. By their reckoning, ecosystems like deserts, temperate forests or high-altitude grasslands may house comparatively fewer species but offer more genera, families or phyla -- broader categories for grouping organisms. And in the end, a habitat with more families or phyla may be a locale of greater genetic diversity than the tropical rain forests in all their chlorophyllic, speciated abundance.
"The lowland, wet tropical forests have held sway as the dominant prom queen of biodiversity," said Dr. Kent Redford, who is in charge of Latin American scientific studies for the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group based in Arlington, Va. "But levels of genera, families and orders as measures of genetic information are better represented in habitats outside rain forests." He rephrases the ecologists' familiar dictum "the imperative of the tropical rain forests" as "the tyranny of the tropical rain forests."
Dr. Melanie Stiassny, an expert in freshwater habitats and in taxonomy at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said: "Scientists are obsessed with numbers. If you have a bigger number and more species, therefore it makes a place very important. Well, yeah, it does in one sense, but if you follow the numbers argument too strictly, you're going to talk about basically insects."
There are many ways, it turns out, to define diversity. Scientists suggest that a region might be considered biodiversified if the scenery and organismic composition changes dramatically from one spot to the next. By at least one estimate, the greatest changeover in species types from hectare to hectare occurs not in rain forests but in deserts.
Alternatively, the most precious biological diversity may be said to lie in places claiming the greatest number of evolutionarily ancient species. Dr. Stiassny cites as an example several small freshwater lakes in Madagascar that contain about 10 species of cichlid fish. These fish are thought to be the evolutionary link between the founder cichlid fish, the mother of the entire, wildly diverse family, and the thousands of cichlid species found worldwide today. "If we were to lose those 10 Madagascan species," she says, it would be far worse than "losing 10 from the mainland of Africa. The information they contain is qualitatively different." All species, she declared, "are not created equal."
In reassessing biodiversity, scientists are tossing out a few ecology verities. For example, old assumptions about an interlocking diversity are not necessarily correct: The fact that a region is diverse in beetles or orchids does not mean it offers up a farrago of birds and frogs. The greatest diversity of insects over all is found in lowland tropics, as is the diversity of small primates. But bees, spiders and reptiles are most diverse in dry regions, as are large mammals -- think of the African savanna. As a general rule, lower altitudes are more species-rich than higher ones, but birds and butterflies, in fact, become more various as one climbs from sea level; there is an enormous diversity in both groups along the eastern slopes of the Andes.
Another general rule, said Dr. Norman I. Platnick, a biodiversity expert at the American Museum of Natural History, is that the Southern Hemisphere is more biological wealthy over all than the Northern Hemisphere, largely because land there has been divided more times by changes in rivers, glacial flows and mountain growth, thereby subdividing populations of plants and animals and setting the stage for their speciation. In a given temperate region of the Southern Hemisphere, for example, there may be five times as many spider and termite species as in northern temperate zones.
The law of southern assets is far from immutable, however. In astudy published recently in the journal Evolutionary Ecology, Dr. Samuel M. Scheiner of Northern Illinois University in De Kalb and Dr. Jose M. Rey-Benayas of the Council for Scientific Research in Madrid, analyzed plant diversity at 94 locations from the Equator to the poles, the first study to consider the global-scale diversity of any group of organisms. They learned that plant diversity is just as rich in the north as it is at an equivalent latitude in the south.
They also found that one of the most critical factors determining the concentration of diversity is seasonality. While plant diversity in tropical rain forests is high, owing to the abundance of moisture, heat and light, it also turns out to be surprisingly high in temperate places. Dr. Scheiner proposes that variations in temperature promote specialization among plants, with some blooming early in the spring, others arriving in summer and still others making their appearance in early fall, when competition has dropped off a bit.
The scientists who are discussing new methods of calculating what constitutes biodiversity in no way advocate a neglect of the tropical rain forests. They emphasize that tropical rain forests possess many unique features, among them an exceptional degree of so-called mutualism, in which a particular species of, say, wasp and a particular species of fig tree are entirely dependent on each other for survival; this sort of intercontingency is thought to have evolved as a result of the relatively constant conditions in the tropics. Nevertheless, scientists are asking for a greater balance and more equitable distribution of the meager conservation dollars available. They ask that closer attention be paid to the biological complexity of ecosystems that may not have the cachet or exotic allure of the jungle.
For example, Dr. Redford said that the Gran Chaco of South America, a mostly arid lowland plains region spanning about 400,000 square miles across Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina, is the second largest ecosystem in Latin America, after the Amazon. "It's disappearing at a much faster rate than the Amazon, but there's been virtually no international attention paid to it, and most people have never heard of it," he said.
Recently, the advocates of a big tent approach to conservation captured the attention of the United States Agency for International Development, which invests about $100 million a year in biodiversity programs around the world. Over the last several years, much of that money has been spent on regions with the greatest number of species, which means the tropical rain forests. But at a workshop held last month in Miami, the agency asked conservationists to figure out how best to "diversify the biodiversity portfolio," as one participant put it.
The conferees focused on Latin America and the Caribbean, said Glenn T. Prickett, chief environmental adviser for the agency. These are regions where biological diversity is thought to be high and yet, given recent Federal budget constraints and an emphasis on regions considered more politically important, like Russia, Europe and Africa, the overall American Government investment in conservation projects there is relatively constrained -- hence the need for the best diversity deal for the dime.
In all the new thinking about biodiversity, ecologists acknowledge several uncomfortable truths. One is that not all species are going to make it. "We have to admit that there's a state of triage, and that we have to pick and choose where to focus our energies," said Dr. Stiassny.
In dealing with questions of biological diversity, ecologists and biologists must also confront their staggering ignorance. They know only a tiny percentage of what exists in nature. Dr. Russell Mittermeier of Conservation International in Washington points out that 1.4 million species have been described, and by current estimates there may be at least 100 million species of organisms alive. Scientists also confess that they lack the hard evidence they covet to persuade the world that preserving biological diversity is necessary for the good of the species people care most about: themselves. Arguments that species and biological diversity should be preserved for their own sake are not sufficient to counter claims of human primacy, lost jobs or hamstrung development. Dr. Thomas Eisner of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., has pressed consistently for the importance of conserving biodiversity to conserve nature's chemical factory and pharmacopeia.
But for all their benightedness, scientists are beginning to piece together a portrait of what constitutes biological diversity and how to think about keeping it around for posterity. Dr. Jonathan Coddington, an entomologist who specializes in biodiversity at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, said that while science knows little about individual species, it has identified nearly all the major families of living organisms, about 7,000 in all. (The family that includes humans, for example, is Hominidae, of which Homo sapiens is the only surviving species). He suggests that if efforts focus on preserving at least a few members of all extant families, then a great deal of the earth's genetic diversity would end up aboard the conservation ark.
In the end, the conservation of biological diversity will depend not so much on scientific or academic considerations as on political, social and economic variables that move to their own whims and rhythms. The preliminary guidelines emerging from the Miami meeting said that apart from biological calculations of a particular landscape's diversity, the United States Agency for International Development must consider such factors as whether a nation is willing and able to make the effort to conserve its biodiversity.
The United States' own record on this score is not quite exemplary. Scientists may be gathering tantalizing evidence that places like the Great Lakes, the Appalachians, the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere are bursting with vast and taxonomically disparate natural assets. But a proposed effort to assess that wealth, called the National Biological Survey, is now bogged down in the Senate, with no sign of passage any time soon.

 BODY:
Ever wonder if people give those dinners, cocktail parties and other festive events that they buy at auctions for worthy causes?
CAROLEE FRIEDLANDER, founder and president of a jewelry firm, was the high bidder for a tea party at the Washington home of the French Ambassador, at an auction more than a year ago. Never able to actually give the tea, which was auctioned to benefit the Vincent T. Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University, she passed it on as a gift to her friend ADRIENNE ARSHT, a banker in Washington. 
 "This is the gift that keeps on giving," Ms. Arsht said yesterday, and explained that she had asked guests at the tea, to be held tomorrow, to bring Hanukkah gifts for children in Russian refugee families.
Among those who plan to attend are Tunky Riley, wife of Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education; Bess Abell, a former White House social secretary, and Ann McLaughlin, former Secretary of Labor.
Ms. Arsht also invited Tony Williams, whom she described as "the hot weekend weatherman on Channel 9," and Erik Tarloff, a screenwriter who is married to Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Ms. Tyson is not coming, Ms. Arsht said, because "I try not to invite couples."
She did, however, invite her own husband, Myer Feldman, who was a White House counsel to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, but he will be out of town.

HEADLINE: For Freer Trade -- and Better Jobs

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole, who once threatened to bury the global trade agreement signed by 124 nations, has now put America's interests first. He has signed onto the accord after extracting innocent side agreements from the White House. Mr. Dole, whose threats were harshly criticized on this page, deserves full credit for rising above politics to rescue an agreement fashioned over seven years of tortured negotiations. His leadership has made it likely, barring last-minute defections by Democrats, that the Senate will approve the agreement on Thursday after the House does so today. Countries around the world will quickly follow suit.
Though Mr. Dole's approval removed much of the drama, the importance of the votes should not be overlooked. The trade accord will deliver a shot of economic adrenaline that few other government policies can match. By some estimates, it will raise living standards in the U.S. by $1,000 or more per family. Rejection of GATT would not only squander these gains, but would also prove diplomatically calamitous. 
 For 50 years the world has looked to the U.S. to lead it through a series of trade-opening agreements that have knocked down tariffs and other trade barriers. The measures have contributed mightily to worldwide growth. Had GATT's opponents won over Congress, the U.S. would have abandoned its leadership role and inflamed protectionist pressures abroad, eventually threatening living standards everywhere.
Like previous agreements, the latest GATT accord will also remove tariffs and other trade barriers. Unlike past agreements, it will cover agriculture and many services and insure that countries honor copyrights, patents and trademarks. It will also create the World Trade Organization, which, as Congress demanded in the 1980's, will impose tougher procedures to resolve disputes. All this amounts to a big victory for American exporters of everything from corn and pharmaceuticals to computer software and legal services. Most developing countries also win. Their exports will gain access to industrialized countries, and the World Trade Organization will protect them from any bullying tactics of wealthier trade partners.
An odd coalition of conservative Republicans and Democrats allied with consumer advocates like Ralph Nader oppose GATT. They make three arguments, none frivolous but none sufficiently important to turn down the accord.
First, critics say the W.T.O. threatens U.S. sovereignty because it can rule that U.S. environmental and safety laws are forms of backdoor protectionism. In one sense, the criticism has to be true: any agreement with other nations necessarily restricts U.S. action. But the danger is grossly exaggerated. GATT panels can rule against U.S. laws even under existing rules. These rules would survive even if the new accord were defeated.
There is one difference. Under existing rules the U.S. can veto an adverse ruling; under the new accord it cannot. But in practice this is a minor distinction. Even though countries can now retaliate against the U.S. for such a veto, most do not do so out of fear that the U.S. would retaliate in turn. That is likely to be the case under the new GATT; in that sense, the accord poses no new threat. Indeed, it includes language that protects U.S. environmental and safety laws that are based on scientific principles and are not deliberately aimed at blocking imports.
Second, critics object to GATT's secret deliberations and skimpy legal protections. They have a point, but again, current dispute panels proceed under even worse rules so nothing important is lost. Finally, critics like Ernest Hollings of South Carolina are understandably upset that textile manufacturers in their states would be subjected to low-cost foreign imports. But that is a reasonable price for the country to pay to rack up huge gains nearly everywhere else.
Proponents and critics alike tend to misstate GATT's impact on jobs. Trade neither creates nor destroys jobs. Employment in the U.S. is primarily determined by the Federal Reserve Board' s efforts to push the economy as close to full employment as possible. What open trade does is steer workers into export industries, which on average pay high wages. That is what the votes this week are all about. Barring catastrophe, the U.S. will once again launch the world on another wave of growth.

HEADLINE: THE LAME-DUCK CONGRESS: THE VOTE;
HOUSE APPROVES TRADE AGREEMENT BY A WIDE MARGIN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The House of Representatives tonight overwhelmingly approved American participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the most ambitious world trade accord put forth in more than two generations.
The issue now moves to the Senate, where its fate in a vote on Thursday is still uncertain. 
 After five hours of frequently heated debate, the House passed the accord 288 to 146.
The agreement would slash tariffs by a third and subject American laws -- from worker safety regulations to environmental controls -- to review by a new international trade court, the World Trade Organization.
House passage today moved the Clinton Administration closer to a crucial legislative success at a time when it is eager to prove that it will be able to work with the Republican majority in both houses of the 104th Congress.
It was also a bipartisan endorsement of one of the key underpinnings of President Clinton's economic strategy: that free trade with all of the country's trading partners, even low-wage, developing countries whose laborers make less than a dollar an hour, will ultimately enrich American workers even if it costs jobs in some noncompetitive American industries.
But many Democrats abandoned the Administration, contending that 40 years of free-trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which squeaked through Congress last year, were costing their constituents jobs and resulting in lower salaries for blue-collar workers.
Today's vote was the first of a lame-duck session called after a Democratic Senator, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, blocked passage of the trade agreement earlier this fall.
Senate leaders said they were still uncertain whether the accord, the eighth expansion of GATT since 1948, would pass. But the margin of victory in the House -- where Republicans voted for GATT 121 to 56, Democrats favored it 167 to 89 and 1 independent voted against -- seemed bound to work in the Administration's favor. Because the bill would add to the national deficit, at least 60 votes will be needed under Senate rules.
Aides to President Clinton said they expected to win a narrow victory in the Senate, but they were taking no chances. Tonight, they were assembling a list of about two dozen wavering senators from both parties who were to be invited to breakfast at the White House on Thursday morning for one last dose of cajoling from Mr. Clinton and the Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the outgoing Democratic leader, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican who will soon become majority leader, were expected to join the President in making final appeals to the assembled senators, White House officials said.
In an effort to sustain the sense of momentum behind the trade accord, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, will hold a news conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday at which Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, will declare their support for the agreement.
Negotiations on the accord that passed today began under the Reagan Administration, and the Clinton Administration found itself leaning on Republicans to assure its passage. That support came at a cost. Republican leaders repeatedly made it clear that the White House owed its GATT victory to them, and particularly to Senator Dole, who endorsed the treaty after striking a deal with President Clinton just before Thanksgiving that seemed designed largely to demonstrate what kind of power Mr. Dole now wields.
"While a few members are concerned about giving President Clinton a victory," Representative David Dreier, a California Republican, said before the vote, "we're going to do that because President Clinton is right on this issue."
Proponents of the bill argued that with the end of the cold war, the United States had to take the lead on free trade to maintain its influence abroad. "This is perhaps one of the most important decisions to be made in the latter half of the 20th century," said Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, a Democrat who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
"We should not isolate ourselves from the rest of the world," he said. "We did that in the 1930's." He was alluding to the Smoot-Hawley legislation, which began an era of isolationism before the outbreak of World War II -- "with disastrous results," Mr. Gibbons said.
But the opposition cast history differently. Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, argued that 47 years of past incarnations of GATT had hardly enriched Americans workers. "Real wages for America's workers have gone down," she said. "You don't have to be a mental giant to figure out that there is a relationship between declining living standards for our workers and our families, and our massive trade deficits."
This year, that trade deficit is expected to top $150 billion, including a $60 billion shortfall with Japan.
If passed by the Senate, and then by more than 100 nations that have been awaiting Washington's action, GATT will dramatically lower tariffs and expand basic trade protection to intellectual property, including movies, computer software and copyrights. It would slowly bring an end to national subsidies for many industries. President Clinton has argued that the result will be a "massive worldwide tax cut" that will lower the price of imported goods and of the domestically produced goods that compete with them.
It was clear from the debate today, however, that even supporters of the accord have only the vaguest views of what it would mean for the nation's economy. While most experts agree that world income would rise because of the liberalization of trade, the estimates vary from a low of $100 billion a year to more than $500 billion by 2005. Advocates of the accord say the American economy would expand by $122 billion a year because GATT would lower barriers for American exports, but opponents call those figures wildly inflated.
Moreover, the vision of an ever-increasing pie has been attacked by environmentalists, consumer advocates and others who argue that the new agreement places trade above all other values, including minimum worker standards and environmental protection.
Both Democrats and Republicans rose to attack Mr. Clinton's premise that, by opening new markets, free trade would create more jobs than it would cost in increased imports.
The pro-GATT voices today focused not on economics, but on the more fundamental objection put forth by opponents: that the new World Trade Organization would become the tool of scores of developing nations. Those nations, opponents argue, would take advantage of their overwhelming numbers in the one-country, one-vote organization to force changes in American law.

HEADLINE: Traders Seek Direction As Stocks Close Mixed

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market, after rising for two days, closed mixed but essentially unchanged yesterday, as long-bond yields again climbed past 8 percent. The real test for equities will likely come today with the release of third-quarter gross domestic product figures that may confirm or dispel traders' fears of an overheating economy.
As in Monday's trading, the number of advancing stocks -- 1,155 -- almost equaled the number of decliners -- 1,075. The narrow division underscores traders' indecision about the direction of the market. But 107 stocks established new lows and only 11 set new highs. 
Yesterday was another seesaw session. The Dow rose a few points in the first half-hour of trading but then suddenly dropped 25 points in the next half-hour or so. In all, the Dow reversed field four times in the day.
The big news was the 10 A.M. release by the Conference Board, a private business research group, of its November consumer confidence survey. The group's index reading of 101.3, up an unexpectedly high 12.2 points, was the biggest one-month gain in more than two years and the highest reading in more than four years. The survey sent bond prices plunging, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 8.03 percent from 7.98 percent.
The surge in consumer confidence dovetailed with strong retail sales over the weekend and confirmed many traders' concerns that the economy was overheating enough to produce inflation.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.01 points, to 3,738.55 yesterday, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.01 points, to 455.17. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, rich in high-technology stocks that have fallen in price recently, rose 5.75 points, to 751.48.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was roughly normal, with 286.6 million shares changing hands, or slightly less than this year's average of 289 million shares.
But the bigger news today will be the Commerce Department's second of three estimates for third-quarter gross domestic product. Private economists expect it to show a slight increase to 3.5 percent from the initial estimate of 3.4 percent. That compares with 4.1 percent in the second quarter. Such revisions are closely watched by traders for clues to future inflation.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.44 point, to 248.90, and the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.50 point, to 433.09.
Among stock groups, long-distance telephone carriers saw their shares fall enough to set new 52-week lows for a second straight day.
The MCI Communications Corporation was the day's most active stock, with 20.6 million shares changing hands in Nasdaq trading. MCI's share price fell as low as 1813/16 , before closing at 19, down 1 1/2. An analyst at Merrill Lynch and Company said MCI's market-share growth was falling slightly. In Monday intraday trading, MCI set its previous 52-week low of 20 1/4.
Shares of the AT&T Corporation dropped to 48 3/8, a new low, before closing at 49 1/8, down 3/8. On Monday, the shares fell to 48 3/4, the previous 52-week low. The Sprint Corporation fell to 29 3/4, a new low, before closing at 30, down 5/8. On Nov. 21, Sprint established its previous 52-week low of 30 1/4.
Eleven of the Dow industrials' 30 component stocks fell, led by Caterpillar Inc., which lost 3/4, to 53 1/4. Of the S.& P. 500 component stocks, 257 rose, led by Northern Telecom Ltd., a maker of telecommunications equipment whose shares gained 1/8, to 32 5/8.

HEADLINE: Cordially if Not Enthusiastically, Mayor and Governor-Elect Meet

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
After all the bitterness and political comedy of manners, George E. Pataki and Rudolph W. Giuliani met for the first time yesterday as governor-elect and mayor, offering a display of cordiality, if not a heartfelt pledge to make up and be friends.
Exactly three weeks after Election Day, the Mayor and the Governor-elect, both Republicans but otherwise at odds since Mr. Giuliani crossed party lines to endorse Mario M. Cuomo, emerged from their meeting promising to put campaign nastiness behind them and work together for New York City and State. 
 And yet, despite the niceties couched in the measured language of diplomats, there were indications that the coolness between them would not go away in a day. Appearing together before reporters for only a few moments, they were asked if the meeting signaled the start of "a warm relationship." Mr. Pataki sidestepped gingerly as Mr. Giuliani stood silently beside him.
"We will work together professionally in the interests of the people of this city and state," said the Governor-elect, who, people close to him said, approached the meeting with a residue of disdain for the Mayor.
The two men met for 70 minutes over breakfast at the Union League Club, the elite bastion of Republican business leaders in midtown Manhattan. They were accompanied only by their senior aides, Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers and Michael C. Finnegan, who was named yesterday as counsel to Mr. Pataki in the Governor-elect's first administrative appointment. [Page B2.]
As the meeting ended, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani also met alone for a few minutes for a private discussion, the contents of which were not disclosed.
Speaking to reporters outside the club, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani said they had a substantive talk on several topics, including the Governor-elect's proposed tax cuts; pending legislation in Albany; the economy; the city's watershed; prisons, and Yankee Stadium.
Almost everything came up, it seemed, except Mr. Giuliani's pointed campaign attacks on Mr. Pataki and Mr. Pataki's subsequent refusal to return Mr. Giuliani's congratulatory telephone calls or, until yesterday, to meet with him one on one.
"The election is over," said Mr. Giuliani, who the day before had refused to attend a meeting that Mr. Pataki had with eight of the city's other elected officials, saying the meeting was an attempt to diminish his standing and that of the mayoralty. "We both have very, very big responsibilities."
Mr. Giuliani also finally had the chance to offer Mr. Pataki the congratulations the Governor-elect had seemed unwilling to accept over the phone after the campaign. "I wished him the very best of luck," he said, "and told him we wanted to work very, very closely with to accomplish his objectives."
The two men went to great lengths to keep their meeting time and place secret, the better, they said, to have a serious discussion and avoid the press. An initial plan to meet at the Yale Club was scrapped on Monday night after reporters learned of it, aides said, and rescheduled for 8 A.M. at the Union League Club, at East 37th Street and Park Avenue.
Mr. Giuliani had said he wanted to avoid a media circus, but the result of all of the secrecy was, naturally, a media circus. A gaggle of reporters gathered outside Gracie Mansion around dawn to stake out the Mayor. When his motorcade emerged before 8 A.M., the six vehicles split up and went in different directions, leaving the press corps, including a photographer who chased on a motorcycle, scrambling to keep up. At one point, the motorcade sped past the car of Mr. Pataki, who was on the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive on his way to the meeting.
The Mayor's press secretary, Cristyne F. Lategano, said that the departure from Gracie Mansion was not diversionary, but that the Mayor's children had simply left for school at the same time. She also said the Mayor's driver did not run any red lights but that his aides took down the license plate numbers of the reporters who did. "For once," she said, "the press will contribute to reducing the deficit."
Once inside the Union League, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Powers met Mr. Pataki and Mr. Finnegan in the Seward Room, sitting at a round wooden table beneath a chandelier for what those on each side described as a businesslike discussion of issues.
During the campaign, Mr. Giuliani had complained that he could never talk to Mr. Pataki without aides to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Pataki's patron, being in the room. Mr. Finnegan, however, is a longtime friend and associate of Mr. Pataki with no special link to Mr. D'Amato. His role has been not unlike that of Mr. Powers for Mr. Giuliani; in fact, Mr. Finnegan and Mr. Powers established the first lines of communication and set up yesterday's meeting, the final location of which was suggested by Mr. Pataki's camp.
In a sign of how time can change all in politics, it was not the first meeting ever between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani. The two had met in 1990, when the state Republican Party sent Mr. Pataki as an emissary to ask Mr. Giuliani to consider running for Governor against Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Powers said that yesterday, the two men seemed to want to establish a professional rapprochement, and that neither brought up the Mayor's endorsement of Mr. Cuomo or the campaign attacks on Mr. Pataki. "George Pataki wants to be a great Governor," Mr. Powers said. "And Rudy feels the same way about being Mayor. They want to work together to achieve those ends."
The meeting came as some in Mr. Pataki's camp sensed that the flurry of attention surrounding the dispute with the Mayor was a distraction at a time Mr. Pataki faces the enormous task of putting together a government long controlled by Democrats.
Afterward, Mr. Pataki said he and the Mayor were "on the same wavelength" on many issues. Presumably those issues included two pieces of legislation they have agreed to oppose together in Albany: one that would increase pension payments to public employees and another that would prevent large cities from using state education aid to fill budget shortfalls.
Mr. Pataki offered warm words for New Yorkers, who overwhelmingly supported Mr. Cuomo, even as he appeared to signal to his upstate supporters that nothing to which he agreed would favor the city alone. "Working with the Mayor, working with the people of the city in the best interests of all the people of this state, is what we will do," he said.
He left after a few moments, and the Mayor described the issues covered. Mr. Giuliani also said he told Mr. Pataki, who is considering reducing the state's work force, about the city's severance programs, which so far have cut 11,000 jobs from a payroll of 216,000 without having to resort to layoffs.
"There are a lot of areas of agreement, and in essence we've done a number of the things that he is going to be about doing," he said. "I offered our help in any way that we could help, either with the things that were successful for us, or the things that didn't work as well."
Mr. Pataki, joined by his wife, Elizabeth, and the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., a member of his transition team, later met for lunch with John Cardinal O'Connor, the leader of the Archdiocese of New York. A spokesman for the Cardinal, Joseph G. Zwilling, said the discussion was informal and private.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Backs Council In Budget Fight With Mayor

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi sided yesterday with the City Council in its legal battle with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, saying he believed the Council had the power to pass its own version of budget changes intended to keep the city's spending plan in balance.
But with the Council poised to override Mr. Giuliani's veto of its spending plan, Mr. Hevesi questioned some of the Council's proposed cuts and urged the two sides to compromise rather than let the courts resolve their impasse. 
 "I'm not saying that the Council's action is good or bad policy," Mr. Hevesi said between meetings with the Mayor and after briefing the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone. "I'm certifying that it is legal.
"I got the clear sense that both are willing to resolve this, but there is a positioning that has to play out."
Yesterday, it was the Comptroller's turn to position himself on the budget dance floor. He chose Mr. Vallone, his fellow Democrat, as his partner but also conspicuously stepped on the Council's toes by warning that the economies it proposed as an alternative to the Mayor's could be too risky, to the tune of $55 million.
Abraham M. Lackman, the city's Budget Director, expressed hope last night that the Council would postpone the scheduled override vote and instead offer alternatives that both Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Giuliani could embrace.
Without such alternatives, the Mayor sounded disinclined to budge. He said he reserved the right to impound spending approved by the Council without the revenue to pay for it, and he again argued that the City Charter provision from 1975 invoked by the Council does not apply.
"If you are a comptroller and not a politician, you don't entertain irresponsible legal arguments that could lead to fiscal chaos," Mr. Giuliani said. "Why wouldn't I resist an action by the City Council that adds $55 million more to the budget?"
Mr. Hevesi seemed to suggest that after the Council vented its anger at Mr. Giuliani, the two sides would find common ground, rather than engage in a protracted legal and political showdown.
Otherwise, he warned, possible confusion over who is empowered to spend what could degenerate from a problem into a crisis that could imperil the city's credit rating, cost it more to borrow money and even trigger the re-emergence of the state Financial Control Board as the arbiter of city budget making.
Mr. Hevesi and others said that any crisis was still weeks or months away, though, a judgment shared by Richard P. Larkin, managing director of the Standard & Poor's bond rating agency.
"If there's a real impasse, that could be cause for concern, but that's not what I think is happening here," Mr. Larkin said.
For more than a month, the Mayor and Council have been wrangling over how to bridge a projected $1.1 billion gap in the $31 billion budget for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. Last week, the Council overwhelmingly rejected the Mayor's budget changes, then approved its own by a veto-proof margin. Mr. Giuliani vetoed the Council's version.
Yesterday, Mr. Hevesi maintained that because the Mayor's changes included an increase in projected revenue, the Council votes were legally valid under the City Charter. To be legally certified, a budget requires the signatures of the Mayor, the Comptroller and the City Clerk, who works for the Council.

HEADLINE: Apache To Buy Fields From Texaco

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Texaco Inc. agreed yesterday to sell some 300 domestic oil and gas fields to the Apache Corporation for about $600 million.
The sale would be one of the largest transactions in a trend that has been sweeping the oil industry in recent years. Major oil companies have been increasing their attention abroad, investing billions of dollars in such areas as Russia and China, while leaving domestic fields to smaller and more nimble independent oil companies like Apache. 
 The smaller companies have been adept at wringing more production and profit out of the older fields, and when Texaco put the fields up for sale in July, Raymond Plank, Apache's chairman, said the fields would be a "laudable transaction for Apache to be involved in," Bloomberg Business News reported. He said yesterday that the properties "can be incorporated quickly into existing operations and will provide economies of scale."
The fields, scattered throughout 15 states, contain the equivalent of more than 100 million barrels of oil, according to Texaco, which said the fields contributed no profits and less than 10 percent of the cash flow it earned from American properties. Apache said they would increase its reserves, which are at about 270 million barrels of oil, by 44 percent.
Clarence P. Cazalot Jr., president of Texaco Exploration and Production, said that "the proceeds from this sale will be redeployed into growth opportunities across the company, including major expenditures on core producing properties in the U.S."
The large oil companies consider many domestic fields less economical to run, particularly with oil prices at $17 to $18 a barrel. But the independents see the fields as opportunities to increase their reserves and production vastly.
"We can run with fewer people and be more efficient," G. Steven Farris, senior vice president of domestic exploration and production for Apache, said in a recent interview.
He also said that the majors had to look for bigger targets in seeking to replace their reserves and were at a disadvantage managing widely scattered fields in the United States.
Texaco said that the sale was expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1995.
The fields are located primarily in producing regions where Apache has existing operations -- the Permian Basin, the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, western Oklahoma, East Texas, the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico. Current average daily production from the properties is approximately 21,000 barrels of oil and 90 million cubic feet of natural gas. Apache will operate some 68 percent of the production and hold an average 70-percent working interest in the operated properties.
Texaco also said that because of low oil prices it would eliminate 2,500 jobs representing 7.7 percent of its worldwide workforce, and it also plans to sell properties in California and North Dakota in addition to those that that Apache plans to buy.
The transaction, which was announced after the close of the stock market, is subject to a definitive agreement, and to the approval of both companies' boards.
Texaco closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $62, unchanged; Apache ended on the Big Board at $25.125, down 12.5 cents.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Has a Surge

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
One of the nation's two major consumer confidence indexes, which are intended to measure the optimism of Americans about their own financial situations, shot up in November to the highest level in more than four years.
The sudden surge in the index compiled by the Conference Board, to 101.3 from 89.1, might be an aberration. But many pollsters and economists agreed on one point: Even without November's jump, the index shows that Americans feel better today about their circumstances than they did in 1993. And they are not bracing for a recession -- although they might be expecting a slowdown next year. 
 The generally optimistic Conference Board report issued yesterday helped to send bond market prices lower and push the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond back over 8 percent. [Page D5.].
"You would not want to get too wound up in trying to explain this one-month blip in the Conference Board's index," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "But in broad terms, the two major consumer confidence indexes reflect optimism about job growth and income gains."
This sort of optimism often develops in the late stages of an economic recovery, and the current one will be four years old in March. The real issue raised by the indexes is whether the recovery is past its peak. The Conference Board index suggests that the best days might still be ahead, while the index compiled by the University of Michigan's Institute of Consumer Surveys suggests that the peak came last winter, although the economy is still quite strong.
"The current level of confidence foretells an expanding economy in the immediate period ahead," the Conference Board said.
The Michigan pollsters do not share that view. "We reached what we think was the peak of the recovery in January, and it has really been quite flat since then," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the Michigan surveys.
The Michigan index hit 94.3 in January and was at 91.6 in November, having settled at that level during the summer. The Conference Board's index, on the other hand, rose to 92.5 in June and then slowly fell, until this surprising jump.
The Republican election victory does not explain the surge, said Fabian Linden, director of the monthly survey by the Conference Board, an organization supported by corporations. Most of the nearly 4,000 replies to a mailed questionnaire were completed before the election.
Whatever the case, the indexes are saying that jobs are easier to find and more likely to last than was the case a year ago, and a low inflation rate has not eroded the small wage gains that have been achieved. In addition, rising interest rates -- the Federal Reserve has raised rates six times this year -- have not yet inhibited consumer borrowing.
These conclusions are evident, economists and pollsters say, in the responses to the questions that the Conference Board asked in November about each respondent's current situation. Some 25.3 percent said their situation was good, compared with 20 percent in September and 22.4 percent in October. More than 50 percent reported no change.
As for jobs, 20.7 percent said in November that jobs were more plentiful, up from 15.8 percent in September and 16.1 percent in October. Again, more than 50 percent reported no change. The Michigan survey's findings for the current situation are similarly strong.
What gets emphasized in such data is how people feel compared with a year or two ago. What gets lost is how they feel in the 1990's compared with their levels of optimism in earlier decades, when jobs were more secure, layoffs were far fewer and wages regularly rose faster than the inflation rate.
The Conference Board's index, at 101.3 in November, is at its high for the current recovery. But in the 1960's the reading went above 140 and it broke 120 in early 1989, before the beginning of an economic slowdown that produced the last recession. Even in July 1990, the first month of the last recession, the reading was 101.7, a figure that had not since been surpassed until yesterday's report.
"We once asked ourselves how much we could improve our standards of living," Mr. Curtin of the Michigan survey said, "and now we concern ourselves with avoiding problems and catastrophes. It is a different perspective."
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index is composed of two subindexes, one measuring the current situation and the other what the households surveyed think will happen over the next six months or so. The subindex about the current situation rose a spectacular 17.4 points in November, to 108.3, accounting for most of the rise in the overall index.
The subindex covering expectations went up only 8.8 points, to 96.7. In effect, the households surveyed were far more optimistic about their present situation than they were about their jobs and their incomes in the future.
The Michigan index is similarly constructed, and its two subindexes are behaving in roughly the same fashion as the Conference Board's, although the Michigan index rarely rises or falls in a single month by as much as the Conference Board's index. Some experts consider the Michigan index more reliable, and the Federal Government monitors it.
"The Conference Board's index is based on a weaker methodology and is more volatile than Michigan's, and my impression is that it is probably less accurate," said Thomas Smith, director of the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center. "The Conference Board's panel of households is not as representative of the nation as Michigan's."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Government Securities' Prices Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The government securities market was clearly settled in a bearish pattern yesterday, as prices fell after a report showed that consumer confidence had surged to a four-year high.
But the decline was tempered by a move by the Federal Reserve to inject money into the banking system. As part of its regular operations, the Fed buys various notes and bonds, usually about $3 billion to $5 billion worth, for the purpose of tempering interest rates, particularly during the holiday season when money may be in tight supply. 
 Traders said the Fed was buying maturities beginning in 1995.
 Some market participants said many dealers were able to sell the Fed securities at fairly high prices, which would explain the prices in afternoon trading.
Although the Fed action supported prices yesterday, the rise in the Conference Board's confidence index should not be minimized in terms of its lasting impact on market psychology. James Hale, a fixed-income analyst for MMS International, said the coupon pass "was the only thing that prevented a massacre today."
The price of the 30-year Treasury fell 16/32 , to 942/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.03 percent from 7.98 percent, or about where the yield was a week ago.
The Conference Board, a New York research group, said yesterday that its index measuring Americans' confidence in the economy surged to 101.3 in November from 89.1 in October, the highest level in more than four years. The market had expected the index to be about 89.
The confidence report was very negative for the market because it suggested that higher interest rates were not slowing down the economy, increasing the prospects for accelerating inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds. The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times this year in an effort to keep a lid on inflation.
"The market has to be thinking that the Fed is coming at the end of January 1995 or sooner" to raise rates, said George R. Mateyo, chairman of the Carnegie Capital Management Company in Cleveland. He noted that it had been four to six years since consumer confidence has been over 100.
Comments by several Fed officials yesterday suggested that the Fed might soon act again.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Cathy E. Minehan, who will become a voting member of the Fed's policy-making committee when it meets on Jan. 31, indicated in a speech in Randolph, Mass., that the Fed might not be finished raising rates. She noted the strong consumption data leading up to yesterday's report and near full employment.
And the vice chairman of the Fed, Alan S. Blinder, said at a conference in Jacsonville, Fla., that "the economy is looking extremely strong."
Today, the Government will release its third-quarter revision to the gross domestic product and will report on production and capacity utilization for November.
In the municipal market, Pennsylvania, in the largest sale expected this week, sold $290.6 million in general obligation bonds yesterday through competitive bidding won by J. P. Morgan Securities.
The bonds were priced to yield from 4.40 percent in 1995 to 6.30 percent in 2005. Some of the issue is insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and rated triple-A by the rating agencies, while the issues are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Gains on Hints Of Another Increase in Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose broadly yesterday, bolstered by strong United States economic news and hints from a Federal Reserve official of further interest rate increases.
Traders said the dollar also benefited from some resilient weakness in the German mark, which fell after Norway's vote to reject membership in the European Union. 
 The dollar's recent strength has been seen as a sign by some currency brokers that the dollar may have snapped out of its prolonged slump. The rally yesterday was broadly based, and came amid declines in the United States stock and bond markets.
"There's a perception that the dollar might have seen its lows for the year," said Jerry Gleason, a foreign exchange trader at the New York branch of Banque Indosuez, a French banking company.
A catalyst for the dollar's strength was a report by the Conference Board, a New York business research group, that showed Americans' confidence in the economy surged in November to its highest level since July 1990.
"There's been a change in sentiment," said Jay Wertheimer, senior foreign exchange trader at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia, an Italian bank. "We're just faced day after day with good fundamental economic news. I think this ghost of inflation that's scaring us seems to have subsided."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5703 German marks from 1.5670 marks on Monday. The dollar also rose to a six-week high of 99 yen in intraday trading, before settling at 98.97 yen, up from 98.67 yen on Monday.
Traders said remarks by the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan S. Blinder, in Jacksonville, Fla., also inspired some dollar buying.
Mr. Blinder hinted that the Fed might raise interest rates further, saying, "The economy is looking extremely strong." The Fed has increased short-term interest rates six times this year in an effort to slow the pace of inflation.
Rising interest rates, coupled with low inflation, can attract investors to dollar-denominated assets. Such a trend creates demand for dollars and raises their value in relation to other currencies.
"At some point, this has got to make the dollar more attractive," said Curtis Perkins, a foreign exchange trader at the New York branch of Chemical Bank.
In other currency trading, the dollar was unchanged at 1.3285 Swiss francs. The British pound was steady at $1.5625.

HEADLINE: Victor Seen In Santa Fe Bidding

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The Union Pacific Corporation, once considered a long-shot spoiler in a bidding war to buy the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, has emerged as the likely winner.
Union Pacific won a crucial agreement yesterday from Santa Fe officials to meet for the first time to share financial information and discuss terms of a merger of the railroad companies. 
 Santa Fe had been resisting such a meeting, saying that a lower offer of $3 billion from Burlington Northern Inc. was more attractive because it stood a better chance of being approved by Federal regulators than Union Pacific's $3.2 billion offer. But yesterday Santa Fe said it would meet with Union Pacific's advisers "in an effort to clarify and improve Union Pacific's offer."
 "In essence, Union Pacific has won," said James M. Higgins, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. He said that unless Burlington Northern raised its bid or a glitch emerged in the talks with Santa Fe, Union Pacific appeared to have taken care of many of the main objections to its offer.
"This is a railroad that is trying very hard to answer the skeptics," Mr. Higgins said.
After Union Pacific made a surprise bid in October, some analysts did not give it much hope. Many said such a merger probably would not be approved by Federal regulators because the heavy overlap of routes between the two railroads would raise too many anticompetitive concerns. Many analysts have been saying that Union Pacific was just trying to break up a Santa Fe-Burlington Northern combination, which, if approved, would have surpassed Union Pacific as the largest railroad in the country.
But the Interstate Commerce Commission gave informal approval on Monday for Union Pacific to establish a voting trust, a crucial strategy intended to shift the uncertainty of the Federal approval process from Santa Fe shareholders to Union Pacific.
The takeover effort is by no means over. Santa Fe, for instance, said yesterday that it wanted Union Pacific to improve its offer. Santa Fe officials have previously said that Union Pacific executives made statements about a possible $20-a-share offer. Burlington Northern officials declined to comment yesterday, but last week they said that they would "stand pat" on their offer.
Santa Fe, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said yesterday that it was postponing a shareholder vote on Burlington Northern's offer by two weeks, to Dec. 16. Santa Fe said it wanted to give its board and stockholders more time to consider alternatives to the offer.
Union Pacific's two-part bid, which consists of $17.50 a share in cash for 57 percent of the company and the remainder in a stock swap, is taxable. Some analysts said Santa Fe might ask Union Pacific to structure the deal to be nontaxable, as is the offer from Burlington Northern.
Union Pacific, based in Bethlehem, Pa., has complained for weeks that it did not have the same access as Burlington Northern to confidential financial information about Santa Fe. Those numbers -- projected earnings and the like -- will help shape negotiations and determine whether it raises its bid, a Union Pacific official said.
By not raising its bid, Burlington Northern, based in Fort Worth, may be hoping that the Interstate Commerce Commission will ultimately rule against a Union Pacific-Santa Fe merger, said Steve Lewins, an analyst at Gruntal & Company.
If that occurs, Union Pacific might be forced to sell Santa Fe to Burlington Northern, giving Burlington Northern a chance to renegotiate its offer without having to compete against Union Pacific.
Their high-profile bidding war, played out in full-page newspaper ads recently, is the most visible evidence of the trend toward consolidation in the railroad industry.
After cutting costs through the 1980's, many railroads have been seeking to improve profitability through economies of scale. Shippers are also increasingly demanding efficient and timely service from railroads, which are also trying to expand their range of services by acquiring competitors.
Santa Fe's board also approved a shareholder rights plan yesterday that would entitle holders to buy stock at half price once a hostile buyer acquires 10 percent or more of Santa Fe. But if the board approves of the acquisition, then Santa Fe may redeem the rights at one cent each.
Santa Fe's shares rose 50 cents, to $16.875 yesterday. Union Pacific's climbed 75 cents, to $46.50, and Burlington Northern's stock rose $1, to $48. Stocks in all three railroad companies trade on the Big Board.

Selloff Fails to Shake Stock Fund Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
American investors may be growing more nervous about their stock market investments, but they keep putting money into equity mutual funds. Even last week's sharp fall in stock prices produced only a relatively small amount of withdrawals, fund managers said yesterday.
That reluctance to get out no doubt helped to stabilize stocks, which recovered part of their losses after the Thanksgiving holiday. At least since 1988, individual investors have shown a willingness to buy on dips, and that behavior continues. 
 Bond fund investors, however, are another story. November may be the worst month ever, in terms of cash flow, for bond funds, which have been hurt by rising losses stemming from higher interest rates.
The comments by fund managers came as the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reported that stock funds continued to pull in money at a rapid rate in October while bond funds saw cash pour out at near-record rates.
The industry's figures for October showed a net inflow of $9.3 billion, including $3.3 billion that went into international and global funds. Bond funds, including both taxable and municipal bond funds, saw a net outflow of $7.9 billion, the largest since $8.7 billion flowed out in October 1987. With several groups reporting increased withdrawals this month, it is possible that record will fall.
Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund group, reported that its investors withdrew about $100 million from stock funds this month, the first such month for that group since March. But other fund groups reported that money continued to come in, albeit at slower rates. Neal Litvack, an executive vice president at Fidelity, said that domestic stock funds took in a net $100 million for the month, a flow offset by $200 million withdrawn from international stock funds.
At Vanguard, equity cash flow was positive, but down from October, John Woerth, a spokesman, said. He added that while there were substantial outflows from equity funds last Wednesday, the day stocks hit their recent lows, money returned later. T. Rowe Price reported similar results, with stock fund cash flows positive but down from the previous month.
At fund groups that sell through brokers, rather than directly to the public, the stock fund outlook appears brighter. "Investors aren't running for the exit," Joan Miller, a spokeswoman for State Street Research group of funds, said. She reported that her company's stock fund cash flows were up this month compared with October.
A similar trend was reported at the New England Funds. "Equity flows are surprisingly resilient," Bruce Speca, an official with the group, said. He added that stock flows were up about 25 percent from October and that international funds were doing well.
For municipal bond funds, which had managed to avoid big withdrawals earlier this year, the news is getting worse. In October, investors took out $2.6 billion, the most for any month since April 1987, when $3.3 billion was withdrawn. Prices for muni bonds have recently declined much more sharply than those for taxable bonds, a fact that seems to have scared some investors.
Still municipal bond funds have held up much better than some other types of bond funds, at least in terms of retaining assets. Total assets of all state and national muni bond funds were $236.4 billion at the end of October, down 9 percent from the peak set in January. Government bond funds, by contrast, have $91.5 billion in assets, down 28 percent from the peak set in July 1993.
And municipal bond fund managers are getting quite nervous. Having sold more bonds than were needed to meet redemptions in October, the level of cash in national muni bond funds rose to 5.1 percent of assets, the highest level in several years.
On the other end of the spectrum, the managers who run precious metals stock funds were evidently surprised by the fact their investors withdrew $172 million in October. Undeterred, those managers were net buyers of stocks, and the cash levels in their portfolios plunged to $201 million, less than half of September's level and just 3.4 percent of assets. That is the lowest percentage in more than three years.
The cash flow figures include new purchases and redemptions, as well as transfers between different types of funds. But they exclude reinvested dividends.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Replacement Players May Play Ball Next Year

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEESBURG, Va., Nov. 29

 BODY:
Barring a 180-degree change in baseball's labor negotiations, the owners not only are headed for implementation of their salary-cap proposal next Monday, but they are also hurtling toward the use of replacement players next summer, their chief labor spokesman said tonight in his clearest comments on the controversial weapon in the clubs' bargaining briefcase.
The remarks by John Harrington came -- almost as an afterthought -- at the end of a long, unproductive day in talks between negotiators for the owners and the striking players at the Lansdowne Conference Resort 15 minutes from Dulles International Airport. 
 The negotiators, after holding separate meetings, spent most of four hours discussing the owners' revised cap plan and new payroll tax proposal, then adjourned for dinner. Instead of returning to the bargaining table afterward, they went to their rooms for the evening, instructed by Bill Usery Jr., the mediator, to return Wednesday morning.
Before going to his room, Harrington, the Boston Red Sox's chief executive, was standing in a corridor speaking socially with reporters when one began asking questions about the day's meeting. The questioning eventually got around to the subject of replacement players, which had been raised earlier in the day by Jerry McMorris, owner of the Colorado Rockies.
"If we have to do that, it will be with a great deal of reluctance," Harrington said. "What Jerry is saying is in the minds of all the baseball owners. We want to make a commitment to the fans that we're going to play the 1995 season with some caliber of professional baseball player.
"We believe it will be entertaining and we believe that's what the fans want. The fans want baseball with the best quality player we can put out there. Our preference is to put major league players out there, but if they're unwilling to play, then we'll have to go with someone else who's willing to play. It's something we don't want to do, and we're working in every respect away from that.
"We don't want to implement on Monday. That's a very reluctant step we want to take. It's our last resort."
Donald Fehr, the union leader, said Harrington has said the same thing about replacement players in negotiating sessions. "Such comments do not make the process more simple," Fehr said. "They have the opposite effect."
Gene Orza, a union lawyer, said the idea of replacement players is "internally inconsistent because only major league baseball players can play major league baseball. In the absence of an agreement on opening day 1995, major league players will be on strike."
The owners are scheduled to meet in Chicago next Monday, and they are expected to vote to declare an impasse in negotiations and implement the salary cap. Harrington said they had to act by then because of the Dec. 7 deadline clubs face for offering salary arbitration to retain rights to their free agents.
Harrington said the possibility of mutually postponing that deadline was discussed briefly today. He said the owners would consider a postponement "under certain conditions." Not discussed, he said, was the Dec. 20 deadline for tendering contracts to the more than 80 percent of the 1,087 players on major league rosters who are unsigned.
The owners want their new economic system in place before they reach these deadlines.
"It could be chaotic," Harrington said of implementation earlier in the day. "But we're trying to tell the players that once you go past the point of implementation, it's difficult to put the yolk back into the egg."
Further indication of the owners' plan to act next Monday was the summoning of the clubs' general managers for a briefing on the new system on the same day at the same place.
Harrington said the owners had hoped at least to have a counterproposal from the union that they could present at the meeting.
"I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get a counterproposal," he said. "We came here with a great degree of expectancy in that regard."
He noted that the tax proposal the owners made 12 days ago was a counterproposal to a players' tax proposal, but he didn't say that it took the owners two and a half months to make it.
The players are expected to reject both the tax proposal and the salary cap, but they did not do that today. Instead, they asked questions about the proposals and received further information from the owners' negotiating team.
The salary cap the owners plan to implement would provide the players with 50 percent of the clubs' designated gross revenue, but in actual practice, the players would receive only about 38 percent of the clubs' operating revenue for their salaries and bonuses.
That ratio of reality would leave the clubs with more than one-fifth less money to allocate for salaries and bonuses than they would have spent this year if the players' strike had not abbreviated the season.
The figures emerged from a breakdown of management economic data in a study made by The New York Times of the proposal that the owners are on the verge of implementing unilaterally.
The proposal, which replaced the original cap proposal made June 14, diluted the revenue to be shared by eliminating the clubs' product-licensing income. The owners removed it because the players didn't want their licensing money included, which the owners had done in their original proposal.
The owners' licensing money is estimated at 5 percent of the clubs' operating revenue, or about $85 million. Without that money, the clubs are left with $1,743,296,000 to divide in half with the players.
But the players' share, $871,648,000, does not go for salaries and bonuses alone. The clubs subtract $133,819,000 for "other" player costs.
That figure includes $65 million for the clubs' contribution to the players' benefit and pension plan and the rest for other expenses, such as meal money and spring training allowances.
The players' share also includes termination pay and salaries for players who aren't in the major leagues but who are on clubs' 40-man rosters. Termination pay this year, according to the owners' labor relations committee, was $30,783,861. No official figures were available for 40-man roster players, but one person familiar with such salaries estimated them at $500,000 a team, or a total of $14 million.
By the time those amounts are subtracted, the clubs would be left with $693 million to spend on salaries and bonuses for major league players, or 38 percent of projected operating revenue. This season, according to management figures, clubs spent $878,564,089, or 48 percent of their pre-strike projection, for operating revenue.

HEADLINE: Don't Rush to Expand NATO

 BODY:
During the cold war there was no disagreement between America and its allies over NATO's purpose: It was Europe's shield against a common enemy. The Serbs' war on Bosnia has exposed deep divisions among the Western powers over NATO's role and the question of European security. Some U.S. policy makers believe that the way to revive NATO is to enlarge it by offering membership and the military guarantees that membership confers to a few countries in Eastern Europe. Their rallying cry is "Expand or die."
That is a questionable idea. If Washington continues to move in this direction, it is sure to generate more trans-Atlantic divisiveness. It will burden NATO's existing members with risky new obligations. Moreover, inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join will affront those who are likely to be left out, like Ukraine and the Baltic republics. Worse yet, expansion could strengthen Russian nationalists opposed to Boris Yeltsin and his Western-oriented reformers. The net result is that a larger NATO could diminish rather than strengthen European security. 
 The scheduled public unveiling of an American proposal to expand NATO was delayed yesterday by internal disarray over the Bosnian crisis. But if it goes forward in its present form, and is not derailed, the proposal will raise some tough questions. Will the U.S. extend its nuclear umbrella to Eastern Europe? Will allied troops be based farther east? How will Soviet-trained Eastern European officers be integrated into the NATO military command? Above all, how can Russia be included -- or be reconciled to being excluded?
That last question is certain to prove troubling to a shaky German governing coalition. Some Germans want to expand Germany's influence in the East; others do not want to set off renewed rivalry with Russia. Moreover, giving a pre-eminent security role to an American-led NATO is certain to arouse resistance from France and others that would like to strengthen intra-European security arrangements.
The U.S. proposal does not identify who the new members will be. Nor does it set a timetable for admission. The actual mechanics of enlargement will be left to a special NATO study.
But the biggest question of all is this: Why rush to decide now about bringing Eastern Europe into NATO? The region faces no imminent threat of attack. If, despite Western efforts, aggressive nationalists do seize power in Russia, it will be years before they can raise an army capable of destabilizing Ukraine and threatening Poland. That is time enough to bring Eastern Europe into the alliance.
A rancorous debate about expansion is likely to distract NATO members from confronting the main causes of Eastern Europe's insecurity -- the political, economic and ethnic tensions arising from the end of the cold war. As a purely military alliance, NATO is ill equipped to ease those tensions before they explode as they did in Bosnia.
Rejiggering NATO is not necessarily the right answer to these more complex problems. Yet as presently conformed, the alliance still provides a useful venue for coordinating U.S. and Western European military strategy and an insurance policy against the revival of aggressive Russia. Why expand it to the breaking point? It would be far better for President Clinton to join his European counterparts in seeking more creative solutions for Europe's problems.

HEADLINE: In America;
Business Beats Brooklyn

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Final approval of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will tear a large hole in the Federal budget. But this breach of the budget is not considered a major problem by Government leaders in Washington because the new GATT agreement will be a bonanza for big business, and that is something favored by Democrats and Republicans alike.
When benefits for working people or the poor are involved, the budget deficit is seen as an insurmountable problem. There is no money for investments in ordinary Americans. But the specter of $42 billion in lost tariff revenues over the next decade is met with a shrug by the movers and shakers in Congress and the White House. As long as it's for business -- well, then, that's all right. 
 Brownsville, a desolate and mostly forgotten neighborhood in Brooklyn, is light years from Washington. Its residents will never be mistaken for the champagne-drinking, limousine-riding lobbyists who are swarming all over Capitol Hill in a gaudy display of corporate muscle on behalf of GATT. A glimpse of this crippled neighborhood was provided in Senate testimony last spring by Anne Kohler, who runs a soup kitchen in a tiny storefront that once housed a bakery:
"Our clients consist of the working poor, single mothers with children, long-term unemployed single men (part of the blue-collar work force, where many jobs have disappeared), married families with children, senior citizens, the mentally ill, the disabled and the handicapped. Some are illiterate, some are college-educated, some are chemically dependent, some worked all of their lives only to find that in old age the safety net has begun to crumble beneath their feet."
What these soup kitchen clients have in common is an economic predicament so dire they cannot be sure from one day to the next that they will eat. This is not easily understood by Congressmen, senators and Presidents who have trouble buttoning their jackets over their ample midsections. Hunger is alien to them.
Ms. Kohler's soup kitchen is called Neighbors Together and is the second-largest in Brooklyn. It serves a simple lunch (canned meat, a starch, canned vegetables) to 500 people a day, five days a week.
"I think most people are unaware of the tremendous poverty that exists in this country," said Ms. Kohler during an interview on Monday. "I see the suffering in the eyes of these people. Some of them are frail and old. There are women who are retarded. They can't work. I get sick to my stomach when I hear the stereotypes about how lazy the poor are, how they're living such great lives at the taxpayers' expense."
One evening Ms. Kohler took a boy from a desperately poor family home to spend the night with her and her husband in a different part of Brooklyn. "I told him he could sleep on the sofabed, or on a makeshift bed on the floor, beside our bed."
A stricken look crossed the boy's face. "Do you have mice?" he asked.
Ms. Kohler said the boy was afraid because his experience was that children who slept on the floor would have mice running over them.
GATT is about power and money and influence. Brownsville is about survival. Some of the very same Government officials who are going to the mat for GATT are also trying to cut the food stamp allotments of the poor. If there is equity in that kind of governing -- not to mention a sense of humanity -- Ms. Kohler has been unable to find it.
"Food stamps!" she cried, her eyes angry. "Can you believe they want to cut food stamps? A monthly allotment of food stamps provides about 88 cents per meal. I'll take you shopping and you see if you can buy a meal for 88 cents. Now they're going to give them less?"
The fine restaurants of the nation's capital are heavily booked for tomorrow night as corporate representatives prepare to celebrate the Uruguay Round's final passage. If the Senate gives the thumbs up, there will be toasts and laughter and triumphant applause, the kind of exuberance that accompanies a sudden acceleration of wealth and worth.
It's the kind of celebration that's as alien to Brownsville as hunger is to Capitol Hill.
