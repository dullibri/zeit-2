HIGHLIGHT: Austerity, we does it. 

 BODY:
The CBO has released the latest assessment of the American Recovery and Reconstruction Act, aka Obama stimulus. What it tells us is that the US federal government has been practicing destructive fiscal austerity since the middle of 2010 (and that's not even talking about what's happening at the state and local level). Here's the average of CBO's high and low estimates of the impact of the ARRA on the level (not the rate of growth) of GDP by quarter:
And you wonder why the economy isn't recovering strongly?

HEADLINE: On Map of Hybrid and E.V. Sales, Pockets of Strength

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A map published by National Public Radio indicates where sales of alternative-power vehicles are at their weakest and strongest nationwide. 

 BODY:
As part of its Getting to 55 M.P.G. series, the National Public Radio program "All Things Considered" created a map, based on data culled from an analysis by Edmunds.com, reflecting sales of hybrids and electric vehicles as a proportion of total passenger vehicle sales in select markets. Nationwide, hybrids and E.V.'s account for less than 3 percent of sales, according to the data, but are significantly more popular on the West Coast and in the nation's capital. More info »

HEADLINE: For Distressed Young Bankers, a Symphony of Small Violins

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Today's DealBook article on the plight of Wall Street twentysomethings has engendered a lot of discussion, but little sympathy for the young casualties of the financial sector's woes 

 BODY:
In "Bonfire of the Vanities," the 1987 novel that would become the canonical chronicle of Wall Street's era of excess, Tom Wolfe described the financial sector as a gilded playpen where "mere boys, with smooth jawlines and clean arteries, boys still able to blush, were buying three-million-dollar apartments on Park and Fifth." These aspiring Masters of the Universe, he wrote, were living in the "season of the rising sap."
Clearly, the sap has dried. Today's DealBook article on the plight of Wall Street twentysomethings has engendered a lot of discussion, but little sympathy for the young casualties of the financial sector's woes.
Reader responses about the new challenges facing these low-level employees ranged from mild schadenfreude to fiery wrath. (Put it this way: Today's comment-moderation queue would make Andrew Dice Clay blush.)
Suzie from Valley Forge, Penn. wrote:
"I can't even begin to tell you how disgusting these people sound to me. Dark rum cocktails and $500 charity dinners - it is about time they got a taste of the real world."
Kathy from Syracuse, N.Y. wrote:
"Perhaps these laid off financial workers can now turn their talents to something that actually contributes to society."
"Furious" from "U.S.A." wrote a nuanced, essay-length meditation on the stratified, nonmonolithic financial sector and the complex power gradients contained therein. Kidding! Here is Furious's actual comment:
"Seriously, how many of these punks looked down on other people and professions? How many of them made fun of people in college or in their daily lives for sweeping floors, creating art, writing plays, teaching? Now they suffer the wrath of their own heartless beliefs that they supported for so long."
Of the more than 250 comments posted by noon Tuesday, only a few dared to speak up for those on the lowest rungs of finance. Timothy C. from Queens pointed out that not all finance workers were millionaires:
"Let's not be too harsh here. I work in the financial industry, and in my own company, about half the workers (myself included) are in the back office, where salaries are generally in the middle-class range. Cuts in the financial industry tend to hit support staff much harder than the headline-grabbing six-figure earners in the front office. Many of my friends who have been laid off were making $40 or $50K a year. Not bad, of course, but nowhere near the stereotype of the financial industry worker."
And "BCNYC" responded sarcastically to Suzie of Valley Forge, Penn.:
"I completely agree with the number 1, Suzie in Valley Forge. People who have money definitely shouldn't spend it on $500 charity dinners to benefit people less fortunate than themselves. They should keep that money and spend decadently."
Over at The Awl, Choire Sicha wrote a semi-defense of displaced finance underlings, pointing out that:
When you're laid off twice by 28, that's rough! And that's tens and tens of thousands of young people who were sold a dream and an expectation about merit, performance and success, and now they're figuring out one by one that it was literally all a lie. Probably half these kids will turn out bitter and evil and scheming, but, if we're lucky, half the kids will figure out that the prevailing corporate system of doing business is utterly screwed. Maybe a few will even do something about it.
On Twitter, the responses somehow managed to squeeze both raised eyebrows and sad trombones into 140 characters.

HEADLINE: Embattled Intellectual Historians Make a Stand

BYLINE: JENNIFER SCHUESSLER


HIGHLIGHT: A new generation of scholars argues for the reclamation of intellectual history, a discipline long considered, if not quite boring, then certainly musty, elitist and out of touch. 

 BODY:
Were the 1970s the most boring decade in history?
Anyone reading the popular press at the time might have been forgiven for thinking so. In 1972, The New York Times reported on the Ford Motor Company's plan to fight boredom on the job and an alternative boredom-reduction plan put forward by the United Auto Workers. The Washington Post, meanwhile, fretted that boredom might be fueling interest in the occult. In 1976, Reader's Digest declared boredom "the disease of our time."
But boredom isn't just boring, Jordan Grant, a graduate student at American University, said in a paper called "Meaning in the Malaise: Boredom and the Remaking of the American Mind in the Seventies," delivered last week at an intellectual history conference held at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Boredom is also a window into important shifts in American intellectual life - not to mention a new research frontier for the sometimes-embattled scholars who study it. 
Mr. Grant's paper, and the conference where he presented it, is part of a resurgence in the fortunes of intellectual history - a discipline long considered, if not quite boring, then certainly musty, elitist and out of touch. While intellectual historians like Richard Hofstadter and Perry Miller once dominated the profession, they were swept aside in the 1960s by the rise of social and then cultural history, which regarded talk of "the American mind" as code for "the mind of white, male Americans who happened to write books."
Today, however, a new breed of young intellectual historian is aiming to integrate the spirit of "history from below" with an approach that doesn't chop American history off at the neck. Young intellectual historians, scholars at the conference were quick to emphasize, have fully absorbed the lessons of the profession's increased attention to questions of race, class and gender, without losing hold of the premise that ideas matter, even in a culture that still considers "intellectual" a term of abuse.
"We still want to talk about ideas, but we see ideas everywhere," said Andrew Hartman, a professor at Illinois State University and president of the newly formed Society for U.S. Intellectual History, which sponsored the conference. "Big ideas affect everybody. It's not elitist to talk about them."
There are some signs that the historical profession, if not the rest of America, might be starting to agree. The blog U.S. Intellectual History, founded in 2010, won the best group blog award from the History News Network. Traffic has nearly doubled in the past year, and recent links by the blogger Andrew Sullivan have sent traffic spiking. The new society, officially formed this summer, aims to further raise the profile of intellectual history, even if job listings for intellectual historians remain scarce.
"We're all scholars trying to get tenure," Michael O'Connor, a professor at Georgia State University and one of the conference's organizers, said. "But a lot of us are also interested in public discourse, in attracting a different audience."
The conference hardly neglected high culture, with papers on the artists Robert Rauschenberg and Barnett Newman, the philosopher Stanley Cavell, and the history of the reception of "Moby-Dick." (The famously savage early reviews of Melville's novel, according to a paper given by George Cotkin of California Polytechnic State University, were due to the fact that the initial, British publication omitted the epilogue, leaving critics totally confused as to how Ishmael could have survived to tell his story in the first place. Lazy American reviewers mostly cribbed from their colleagues across the pond.)
But the lineup tilted markedly toward postwar political history, with discussions of charged topics like the economist Friedrich von Hayek's writings on the rule of law, Daniel Patrick Moynihan's infamous 1965 report on the black family, and the art-historical theories of the evangelical thinker Francis Schaeffer, who has been much in the news in recent months because of his supposed influence on Michele Bachmann.
Asked about the conference's political emphasis, Mr. O'Connor cited the jurist Richard Posner's definition of a public intellectual as an intellectual interested in politics. "When I first read that, I thought it was dumb and reactive," Mr. O'Connor said. "But he's right."
While the conference's 140-odd participants skewed young, the gathering also attracted notable senior scholars, including some who have carried the torch for intellectual history through decades of eclipse. James T. Kloppenberg, a historian at Harvard andthe author most recently of "Reading Obama,"a study of the books and thinking that influenced the president, said intellectual history had benefited from a broadening of social history, which had opened a promising back door by asking more questions about the meanings ordinary people attached to experience.
"When you begin asking questions about meaning," Mr. Kloppenberg said, "you're in the realm of intellectual history."
But not all the senior scholars in attendance were so quick to embrace the "I" word. In her keynote address, Pauline Maier, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of "Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788,"described the ardent popular debate surrounding America's founding document - a talk that both reaffirmed the sense of ideas as drivers of history while challenging the notion that the ideas of the elite mattered most.
Asked afterwards if she considered herself an intellectual historian, Ms. Maier hesitated. "I do political history," she said, though she added: "How can you understand what people do if you don't try to understand what they think?"

HEADLINE: Forstmann Equity Firm to Name New Leader

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Julian H. Robertson Jr. is expected to succeed Theodore J. Forstmann, the co-founder of the private equity firm and prominent financier who died on Sunday. 

 BODY:
Julian H. Robertson Jr., the hedge fund manager, is expected to be named chairman of Forstmann Little, succeeding Theodore J. Forstmann, the co-founder of the private equity firm and prominent financier who died on Sunday.
Forstmann Little, which has largely wound down its operations, still has three investments in its portfolio: IMG, the sports, fashion and media company; 24 Hour Fitness, a health club chain; and ENK International, a fashion-industry trade-show business.
Mr. Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management, a hedge fund, will oversee the firm's holdings, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Mr. Forstmann designated Mr. Robertson as his successor before he died, these people said.
 A large part of Mr. Robertson's job will be to sell the firm's remaining businesses. Forstmann's fund formally expires on June 30, 2012, and it is contractually required to sell the assets and return proceeds to its limited partners by then. 
But the firm has been in conversations with its limited partners about extending the deadline to allow for the best possible sale price for the fund's assets, which, given the current state of the economy, could take a year or two beyond the deadline, these people said. Most of the limited partners have indicated a willingness to let the deadline lapse, these people said.
Separately, IMG is expected to name Michael J. Dolan, the company's current president and chief operating officer, as its new chairman and chief executive, replacing Mr. Forstmann in those posts, these people said. Mr. Dolan, who was brought in by Mr. Forstmann, was formerly chief financial officer of Viacom and helped lead the spinoff of Viacom from CBS. 
While no exit strategy for IMG has been determined, the company is expected to consider an initial public offering or sale, or a combination of both, in the next 18 months, these people said.
Mr. Dolan will take control of a business that over the last decade has grown from a sports agency that managed athletes' careers to an entertainment conglomerate that manages and produces thousands of events, like the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York and the World Snowboarding Championships in Oslo. 
It still represents some of the world's most prominent athletes, like the professional football players Peyton Manning and Eli Manning, and the tennis players Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova.
In recent years, the firm has made an aggressive push to develop sports markets in fast-growing international economies. IMG forged a deal with the Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista to build its business in Brazil, which is hosting the soccer World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. 
The firm also reached an agreement with Reliance Industries, the Indian conglomerate owned by Mukesh Ambani, to expand professional soccer and basketball leagues in India.
IMG was the last, big investment made by Mr. Forstmann, the pioneering private equity deal maker who died of brain cancer on Sunday at the age of 71. He paid $750 million for IMG in 2004 and became its chairman.
A spokesman for Forstmann Little and IMG declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Balancing the Budget, for Real

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Most Republicans in Congress simply will not acknowledge that tax increases are necessary to balance the budget, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
On Friday, the House of Representatives voted on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. At the last minute, the leadership substituted a straightforward version, H.J. Res. 2, in lieu of the spending limitation amendment reported by the House Judiciary Committee that I criticized last week. 
While I'd like to think that Republican leaders realized the folly of writing an inexact concept like gross domestic product into the Constitution, more likely the reason was that they hoped to attract the votes of "blue dog" Democrats by offering a less radical proposal.
In the end, the Republican ploy didn't work, and the balanced budget amendment was unable to attract the necessary two-thirds vote. Only 25 Democrats joined almost every Republican in supporting the amendment. 
Interestingly, four Republicans opposed the amendment, and one of them was Representative David Dreier of California, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee. In this position, his job is to follow the dictates of the House leadership and ensure that the rules for debate are as favorable as possible to its wishes. In other words, Mr. Dreier is not a Republican dissident, but someone whose position requires that he be among the most loyal and dependable supporters of whatever his party favors. 
For decades, virtually all Republicans have supported a balanced budget amendment. Indeed, Mr. Dreier himself long took that position and previously voted for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. So, it is remarkable that Mr. Dreier was among the "no" votes on the measure.

But on Thursday, Mr. Dreier told the House that he had changed his mind. Back in 1995, Mr. Dreier said he thought the budget would never be balanced without a constitutional requirement. But two years later, the budget was, in fact, balanced. As he explained:
I said at the outset that I believed when I cast that vote in January of 1995 in favor of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that it was the only way that we would be able to achieve a balanced budget. I was wrong. Two short years later, we balanced the federal budget, and that went on for several years. It went on until 2001.
Republicans seldom talk about the balanced budgets of fiscal years 1998 through 2001, because they happened on Bill Clinton's watch. They either pretend they didn't happen, imply they occurred through some sort of "immaculate conception" unconnected to Clinton's policies or try to claim that the 1997 cut in the capital gains tax led to an outpouring of revenue that balanced the budget.
The truth is that the federal surpluses resulted from specific legislation enacted in 1990 and 1993 that virtually every Republican opposed. In particular, taxes were increased and tight budget controls were put in place that prevented taxes from being cut or spending increased unless offset by tax increases or spending cuts. These budget controls are commonly referred to as "paygo," for pay-as-you-go.
What happened can be seen in Congressional Budget Office data. When the 1990 budget deal took effect in fiscal year 1991, federal spending was 22.3 percent of G.D.P. and revenue was 17.8 percent. The deficit was 4.5 percent of G.D.P. Revenue rose steadily to 19.9 percent of G.D.P. by fiscal year 1998 and spending fell to 19.1 percent, yielding a budget surplus of almost 1 percent of G.D.P. 
Revenue continued to rise to 20.6 percent of G.D.P. in fiscal year 2000, and spending fell to 18.2 percent. The surplus reached 2.4 percent of G.D.P.
These results run 100 percent contrary to Republican dogma, which is that tax increases, especially on the rich, do not yield additional revenue because people will cease working and investing, and the economy will stagnate. Yet the hallmarks of the 1990 and 1993 budget deals were an increase in the top income tax rate; first to 31 percent from 28 percent, and then to 39.6 percent. Revenue clearly rose, as did the economy.
The hallmarks of the George W. Bush administration were large tax cuts almost annually. These were supposed to stimulate growth and lead to lower spending by "starving the beast." Revenue fell more than 2 percent of G.D.P. by fiscal year 2007, which ended just before the recession began in December 2007. Spending rose to 19.6 percent of G.D.P. because of two unfunded wars, unchecked spending on earmarks by Republicans in Congress and creation of a new entitlement program, Medicare Part D. We went from a surplus of 2.4 percent of G.D.P. to a deficit of 1.2 percent.
In 2002, Republicans got rid of paygo so that they could cut taxes and increase spending without constraint.
Thus we have a perfect test of two economic theories: one that says raising taxes and imposing binding constraints on spending will balance the budget, which was successful, and another that says cutting taxes will starve the beast, which failed spectacularly. 
And just for good measure, the former set of policies were far more stimulative to economic growth than the latter, as shown in the following table from the Congressional Research Service.
In short, Representative Dreier was quite right to say that amending the Constitution was unnecessary to balance the budget; it required only the will to embrace tax increases. But this is anathema to Republicans, who preferred to allow the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to fail than to accede to any net increase in taxes.

HEADLINE: Democrats Say Romney Ad Distorts Obama's Comments

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's campaign ad suggests Barack Obama made provocative comments that really originated from Senator John McCain. 

 BODY:
5:37 p.m. | Updated Democrats reacted ferociously on Tuesday to Mitt Romney's first campaign commercial, an ad they said purposely distorted comments by President Obama to make it look like he was running away from the economy.
The ad was part of a conscious effort by Mr. Romney to confront the president during a visit to New Hampshire. And it was designed to foreshadow the aggressive, combative posture Mr. Romney will take in challenging Mr. Obama if the former Massachusetts governor becomes the Republican nominee.
In the ad, Mr. Obama is heard declaring that "if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose." Cut out by Mr. Romney's campaign was the context of Mr. Obama's comment: "Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose."
Mr. Obama's allies assailed the spot, accusing Mr. Rommey of being "deceitful" and "dishonest" by suggesting Senator John McCain's words were actually Mr. Obama's. Jay Carney, the president's spokesman, said aboard Air Force One: "Seriously? I mean, an ad in which they deliberately distort what the President said? I mean, it's a rather remarkable way to start."
Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, called Mr. Romney a "serial deceiver" and said that "his deceptions know no bounds."
But Mr. Romney's top advisers were unrepentant, calling the response "hysterical" and accusing Mr. Obama's campaign of routinely lying about Mr. Obama's record. 
"This is what happens to people who forget that there is a process by which they will be challenged, and they will be held accountable," said Stuart Stevens, a top adviser to Mr. Romney and one of his key ad-makers. "They don't get to choose what this race is about. It's going to be candidate Obama running against President Obama."
Aides to Mr. Romney refused to give any ground on their use of the ad, saying Mr. Obama's campaign had misrepresented it in the first place in 2008 as an official position of Mr. McCain's campaign. In fact, they note it was a quote from an unnamed "McCain strategist" and not an official statement from his campaign.
"They knew absolutely well that wasn't a position of the McCain campaign and they went out and said it with that mocking tone, day after day after day," Mr. Stevens said. "We believe if he keeps talking bout the economy, they will lose. they are welcome to prove us wrong."
The result of the back-and-forth was to highlight an ad that Mr. Romney's campaign spent relatively little to air -- just $134,000 to air on one New Hampshire television station. By generating controversy, Mr. Romney's campaign managed to get a much wider distribution for the ad.
But Mr. Romney's campaign is also orchestrating a series of other welcome-back events: rallies near the site of the president's visit, wall-to-wall radio and television interviews by allies of Mr. Romney and an open letter to Mr. Obama in the state's three largest newspapers.
In the ad, Mr. Romney writes in a polite - but firm - tone, directly addressing Mr. Obama as the Republican nominee might eventually do next year:
"The evidence is in and it is unequivocal. I will be blunt. Your policies have failed," Mr. Romney writes. "It is bad enough that they have fallen short even by the standards your own administration set for itself. But things are much worse than that. Far from bringing the crisis to an end, your policies have actively hindered economic recovery."
Mr. Romney adds: "So once again, Mr. President, welcome to New Hampshire. We need a great debate about how best to get our country working again. We can't afford four more years of failure."
If there was any doubt that Mr. Romney's campaign is looking beyond the primary toward a fight against Mr. Obama, even his top advisers are barely concealing that fact now.
Gail Gitcho, Mr. Romney's communications director, said in an interview Monday night that the effort in New Hampshire represents the campaign's "most intense" effort yet to confront the president when he travels around the country.
"Every day from now on, the American voters and the Romney campaign are going to hold the president responsible," she said.
Mr. Romney is ratcheting up his attacks on Mr. Obama's record in a state that the Republican feels particularly good about. He remains well ahead of his rivals in a state he now calls home.
But Mr. Obama's supporters in the state say they reject the idea that the president - who won the state handily in the 2008 general election, having lost the primary to Hillary Rodham Clinton - is heading into Mr. Romney's backyard when he arrives on Tuesday.
"I don't see this as Romney territory or Romney turf," said Kathy Sullivan, a lawyer in New Hampshire and a former chairwoman of the Democratic Party in the state. "It's really a question of is there an alternative?
It's not because they like the guy."
Ms. Sullivan conceded that polls have shown an eroding of support for Mr. Obama in the state in recent months. But she attributed that to months of attacks from Republican candidates for president. Because there is not a Democratic primary playing out in the state this year, she said, Republicans are the only ones with the megaphone.
"We have had a parade of Republican candidates coming in and out of the state. They are here all the time," she said. "They have been incessantly attacking the president for months without really being held accountable."
Ms. Sullivan added that Mr. Obama's visit to the state on Tuesday will "start to remind people of why they did like Barack Obama."
That will be one of the central arguments in the 2012 general election campaign if Mr. Romney becomes the Republican nominee and faces Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney is hoping to make the election a referendum on Mr. Obama's record in office - a record he's trying to portray negatively months before the primary campaign is over.
In a nearly hourlong interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Monday night, Mr. Romney repeatedly attacked the president's record, even as he virtually ignored his Republican rivals.
"I want people to remember that when he was candidate Obama, he said he was going to get this economy going," Mr. Romney told Mr. Hannity. "The contrast between what he said and what he did is so stark."
Mr. Romney added: "He has made America a weaker nation. That's inexcusable."
It's a message that Mr. Obama's advisers disagree with strongly. And it's a message that the president is likely to ignore when he arrives in the state on Tuesday to kick off a new campaign to extend the payroll tax.
Aides to the president said Tuesday morning that Mr. Obama will lash out at Republicans in Congress for blocking the tax cut. "If Congress fails to extend the current payroll tax cut, taxes will go up on millions of people at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet," a White House official said.
Mr. Obama plans to unveil an Internet "calculator" that will allow voters to see how much more they would pay in taxes if the Congress allows the payroll tax cut to expire at the end of the year, as scheduled. The tool - located here - says that a couple making $75,000 would pay an additional $1,500 if the tax expires.
The contrast between the two men offers an early glimpse of the competing messages that each will probably offer if Republicans choose Mr. Romney as their standard-bearer.
That day is months away. But as the Romney campaign wrote in the subject line of an e-mail to reporters on Monday: Game On.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Failure

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Speaking an hour after the deficit-reduction committee announced that it had failed to reach a deal, President Obama promised to veto any legislation that seeks to avoid automatic cuts to military and domestic programs, saying the deficit would be trimmed by at least $2.2 trillion one way or another, Jennifer Steinhauer, Helene Cooper and Robert Pear report. The panel's demise seemed to seal the image of Washington as a place where little can be accomplished, even when the consequences of failure are clearly visible to the American people.

        
President Obama kept a distance from the special deficit committee in Congress, showing more clearly than ever his calculation: Republicans will never agree to raise taxes on the wealthy to balance any spending cuts, so let the voters decide. Analysts expect Mr. Obama to campaign by contrasting what he calls his "balanced" approach to putting the nation on solid fiscal ground again to Republicans' anti-tax reliance on spending cuts, Jackie Calmes reports.

        
President Obama returned from a trip to Asia that was filled with signs that the United States plans to be a counterweight to Beijing's growing influence in that region, as Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates stepped up their denunciation of China's trade practices, Mark Landler writes. It is an unusual case in which domestic politics are playing to Mr. Obama's diplomatic advantage, allowing him to project to China the picture of a country united in its resolve.

        
In response to the growing tension between the politicians who debate and the journalists who moderate, the news media outlets that sponsor the Republican primary debates have been steeling themselves for combat, Jeremy W. Peters writes.

HEADLINE: Ad Watch: Romney Takes On Obama

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The spot's most devastating line is also it's most misleading. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign began broadcasting its first television ad in New Hampshire on Tuesday - the same day that President Obama visited the state to talk about his plan to turn around the economy.

THE SCRIPT
The words, "On October 16, 2008 Barack Obama Visited New Hampshire," flash across the screen before spliced video of Mr. Obama's campaign in 2008 begins: "Thank you. Thank you New Hampshire. How is everybody doing today? I am confident that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. Who's been in charge of the economy? We need a rescue plan for the middle class. We need to provide relief for homeowners. It's going take a new direction. If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose."
 As Mr. Obama speaks, the words, "He failed," flash across the screen, before the ad switches to Mr. Romney, who says: "I'm going to do something to government. I call it the smaller, simpler, smarter approach to government. Getting rid of programs, turning programs back to states and, finally, making government itself more efficient. I'm going to get rid of Obamacare. It's killing jobs. And it's keeping our kids from having the bright prospects they deserve. We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in. I'll make sure that America is a job-creating machine like it has been in the past. It's high time to bring those principles of fiscal responsibility to Washington, D.C. I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message."
ON THE SCREEN
The ad starts with grainy, faded pictures Mr. Obama on the campaign trail in 2008, interspersed with images of empty storefronts and for sale homes with foreclosure signs hanging out front. When the ad switches over to Mr. Romney, the images become bright and pristine, and feature the former Massachusetts governor - always in a button-down work shirt - talking to small groups of workers and addressing town halls.

ACCURACY
The ad's most devastating line - Mr. Obama saying, "If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose" - is also its most misleading, and has already come under attack from Democrats and Mr. Obama's re-election campaign for being "deceitful and dishonest." In fact, Mr. Obama uttered the line in 2008, when he was referring to something that an aide to his then opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona, had said in reference to the McCain campaign - not Mr. Obama, then or now. Mr. Obama's full quote, which the Romney campaign edited down, was: "Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose."
In an e-mail release, the Romney campaign defended its use of the truncated quote, explaining that, "the tables have turned," and the line Mr. Obama once used against Mr. McCain could now be leveled against Mr. Obama.
One other problem with the 60-second spot is the implication that Mr. Obama is trying to avoid talking about the economy. Out of necessity, Mr. Obama frequently addresses the economy; the ad was pegged to first be broadcast on the day Mr. Obama heads to New Hampshire - where, in fact, he will be talking about the economy.
SCORECARD
Mr. Romney has cast himself as a turnaround expert with 25 years in the private sector, and it makes sense for him to hit Mr. Obama on the economy, presenting himself as a viable alternative. However, pundits and fact-checkers are already criticizing the spot for its out of context line, which, while earning Mr. Romney lots of free media, could also backfire with voters who dislike negative and misleading ads.

HEADLINE: What to Look for in Tonight's Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich's performance is sure to be closely watched in a Republican presidential debate on foreign policy and national security. 

 BODY:
Whom will Professor Gingrich lecture this time? 
As the Republican candidates for president gather once again for a debate on Tuesday night, it will be Newt Gingrich whose performance will be scrutinized, as voters and pundits try to decide whether he has transformed himself into a serious contender for the nomination.
Mr. Gingrich -- whose staffers abandoned him months ago, declaring that he was not doing what was necessary to win -- has surged in the polls in recent weeks, in part because he has repeatedly scolded debate moderators for asking what he deemed were dumb questions.
"My colleagues have done a terrific job of answering an absurd question," Mr. Gingrich said to CNBC's Maria Bartiromo during one of the recent debates. 
In another debate, Mr. Gingrich lectured John Harris of Politico, "I, for one, and I hope that all of my friends up here are going to repudiate every effort of the news media to get Republicans to fight each other, to protect Barack Obama, who deserves to be defeated."
The criticism of the moderators and the news media have been big hits in the debate halls, and may have helped persuade voters to take a second look at Mr. Gingrich. In nine debates, Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, has mostly avoided serious questions about his Washington career, his personal life and his flip-flops on issues that are often critical to conservatives. 
At Tuesday night's debate, however, the dynamic is likely to be different for Mr. Gingrich. He will most likely be the target of more intense questioning by moderators who are prepared for his zingers. And he's likely to feel the heat from his fellow candidates as well.
The candidates gather for the two-hour debate, which begins at 8 p.m. Eastern time, at the Daughters of the American Revolution Constitution Hall in Washington; it will be broadcast by CNN, with Wolf Blitzer moderating.
Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has shown little interest in directly challenging his rivals so far, though he did take a shot at Mr. Gingrich during one exchange over Mr. Romney's support for an individual health insurance mandate.
"Actually, Newt, we got the idea of an individual mandate from you," Mr. Romney said after Mr. Gingrich called the health care plan Mr. Romney signed in Massachusetts a "big-government, bureaucratic, high-cost system."
"You did not get that from me," Mr. Gingrich countered. 
Moments like that could be more frequent at Tuesday's debate, as the other Republican contenders seek time in the spotlight and try to slow Mr. Gingrich's rise in the polls.
Here are some other things to watch for:
* Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, has slumped in public surveys after a series of poor debate performances, capped off by a 53-second flub in which he said he would shut down three federal agencies as president but was unable to name the third.
Since the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Perry has sought to cast himself as the alternative to Mr. Romney. But Mr. Gingrich's rise in the polls suggests that voters are turning to him to play that role, at least for now. That could lead to some clashes between Mr. Perry and Mr. Gingrich.
* Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, has been on a roller coaster in the polls -- quickly becoming a conservative favorite on the strength of his "9-9-9" tax plan, only to stumble in the wake of sexual harassment charges and flubs on foreign policy questions.
His answer to a question about Libya, in particular, has increased the importance of this debate, which is supposed to focus on national security and foreign policy. His campaign hopes to demonstrate that he has the necessary grasp of issues.
* Jon M. Huntsman Jr. may have an edge on his colleagues on such issues. A former ambassador to China and a former governor of Utah, Mr. Huntsman has so far been unsuccessful in translating his experience abroad into momentum in the presidential contest. 
In an op-ed posted on CNN.com Tuesday, Mr. Huntsman argues that the country needs to "let go of old 'sacred cows,'" part of his assertion that the United States should quickly and completely withdraw its forces from Afghanistan. 
"We must risk American blood and treasure overseas only when there exists a vital national security interest," Mr. Huntsman wrote.
He is likely to make that argument again in the debate. But Mr. Huntsman has so far failed to find traction for his candidacy, making the gathering in Washington another opportunity to outmaneuver his rivals on a subject he knows.
* The other candidates -- Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Ron Paul of Texas and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania -- will also try to regain the spotlight from their rivals. 
And all of the candidates will probably use the opportunity to heap criticism on President Obama. Mr. Romney's first television ad of the campaign, shown Tuesday, lashes out at Mr. Obama's economic record and was heavily criticized by Democrats as deceitful for taking a quotation from the president out of context. 
Expect the moderators of the debate to ask about the ad, which is running only in New Hampshire. Doing so will give the spot a wider distribution -- perhaps something the campaign wanted all along.

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The eight Republican candidates for president will take the stage in Washington tonight at 8, but all eyes will be on Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. 

 BODY:
The eight Republican candidates for president will take the stage in Washington at 8 tonight, but all eyes will be on Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House.
Mr. Gingrich has swiftly risen in national polls in recent days, becoming the current threat to Mitt Romney's hopes of winning his party's nomination.
Debates have been Mr. Gingrich's strength, and his campaign is hoping to use tonight's face-off to help cement the idea that he has the best ideas for the country, especially when it comes to national security, the focus of the debate.
Mr. Romney is likely to try to keep the focus on President Obama after a day in which he unveiled his first ad attacking the incumbent in the White House.
Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, and Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, are hoping to jump-start their campaigns after flubs that have cost them support in the polls.
The debate will be broadcast on CNN. We'll be providing real-time analysis and fact-checking on our debate dashboard and also taking suggestions from readers for candidate statements that deserve a closer look. You can submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #asknyt or on the dashboard.

10:38 P.M. | That's a Wrap
The debate is over and the candidates have gone home. The Caucus live blog has ended, too. But feel free to scroll through our fact check feature at your leisure. And come back to The Caucus and the rest of NYTimes.com Wednesday morning for breaking news and analysis of the 2012 election.
10:33 P.M. | Fact Check: Terrorism in Mexico 
 Is Perry's claim that "we know that Hamas and Hezbollah are in Mexico" true? 
Mary, Garden City, N.Y. 
In his answer on immigration, Mr. Perry said Mexico was in danger of becoming a staging ground for terrorist attacks on the United States.
"We're seeing countries start to come in and infiltrate," he said. "We know that Hamas and Hezbollah are working in Mexico, as well as Iran, with their ploy to come into the United States."
Mr. Perry was referring to what American prosecutors have called a recent plot by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, a plot that would have used hitmen from a Mexican drug cartel. Hamas and Hezbollah are supported by Iran and sometimes seen as proxies for Tehran.
But according to a 2010 State Department report, Mexico is not a staging ground for any terrorist group targeting the United States.
- 
10:31 P.M. | Fact Check: Abortions in China
The debate had relatively few rhetorical blasts against China, perhaps because President Obama just returned from an Asian tour in which he announced a muscular new policy toward Beijing.
In his closing statement, however, Rick Perry cited the rise of China as the greatest national-security threat to the United States. He repeated his prediction that "Communist China" will end up on the ash heap of history because it is a country lacking principles. As evidence, he cited China's hacking of computers and alleged that in China, there are 35,000 forced abortions a day. 
That number has been cited by some human rights activists, who say that because of China's one-child policy, families often screen for the gender of unborn children and then abort those who are female. In 2011, the Guttmacher Institute estimated that there were nine million abortions in China - or a rate of about 25,000 a day.
- 
10:16 P.M. | Fact Check: Syria, Oil and No-Fly Zones
 does Syria have a lot of oil??
@teenagepundit, via Twitter
The Republican candidates split over the issue of whether to implement a no-fly zone over Syria to protect opponents of the regime there.
Mr. Perry pushed that idea as a serious option, saying that if "we are serious about Iran, we have to be serious about Syria as well."
But Mr. Cain said he would not support a no-fly zone, arguing that it is better to use economic sanctions - like working with American allies to stop buying Syrian oil. But it is not clear that such sanctions would really affect the volume or value of Syrian exports, since there are plenty of other countries that would buy its petroleum. (For the record, according to the C.I.A., Syria produces about 400,000 barrels of oil a day, and exported about two-thirds of that as of 2009.)
Mr. Romney agreed with Mr. Cain, saying, "This is not the right time" for a no-fly zone over Syria. He said he favored sanctions and covert actions to deal with the country's regime.
- 
10:02 P.M. | An Array of Responses to 'Biggest Threat?'
What is the biggest threat no one is talking about? An interesting question for all of the candidates:
Mr. Santorum: South and Central America.
Mr. Paul: Overreaction.
Mr. Perry: China.
Mr. Romney: Latin America.
Mr. Cain: Cyberattacks.
Mr. Gingrich: Electromagnetic pulse attacks, a nuclear weapon in an American city, cyberattacks.
Mrs. Bachmann: Losing the peace in Iraq.
Mr. Huntsman: Debt.
- 
9:55 P.M. | Fact Check: No Apology
Mr. Romney again repeated the familiar Republican charge that President Obama has apologized for the United States around the world. Here's what we wrote in September about this statement :
It is true that early in his term, Mr. Obama promised to abandon policies of his predecessor, George W. Bush, on issues like the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and a foreign policy in Iraq and elsewhere that Mr. Obama described as unilateral. But it is hard to find evidence that Mr. Obama ever said he was "sorry" for the United States. And in some speeches, notably after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Obama offered a robust defense of American policies, including the war in Afghanistan.
- 
9:51 P.M. | A Temporary Peace Between Romney and Perry?
It looked as if Mr. Perry was looking for another clash with Mr. Romney - or maybe just expecting one.
After Mr. Romney mentioned immigration "magnets" and mentioned in-state tuition programs like the one Mr. Perry backed in Texas, Mr. Perry took note.
"Here we go again, Mitt," said Mr. Perry, perhaps bracing for another back-and-forth over the issue.
But the clash never came. Mr. Perry declined to go after Mr. Romney's hiring of illegal immigrants to work on his yard. And Mr. Romney did not specifically go after the Texas program Mr. Perry supported.
Maybe a bit of detente?
- 
9:49 P.M. | More Camera Time for Ron Paul
Mr. Paul, whose campaign claimed after the last debate hosted by CBS News that he got only 90 seconds of air time, is playing a more central role tonight, and he is serving as a dramatic foil to his rivals. On foreign policy, his views are even farther from those of his Republican rivals than from the views of President Obama and other Democrats.
Mr. Paul calls his foreign policy position non-interventionist. To outsiders, it can sound isolationist. He believes that all of the country's military engagements since World War II have been illegal and morally wrong. 
Mr. Paul, who in recent polls in Iowa has emerged in a statistical tie for the lead, clashed with Mr. Gingrich over the the Patriot Act, which is designed to prevent terrorist attacks. Mr. Gingrich would strengthen it. Mr. Paul called it "unpatriotic" and said that tightening surveillance of suspects was a step toward a "police state.''
Mr. Paul also clashed with Mr. Santorum, who said he favored ethnic and religious profiling of travelers, including Muslims. Mr. Paul's response: "That's digging a hole for ourselves. What if they look like Timothy McVeigh?,'' a reference to the American-born Oklahoma City bomber.
And Mr. Paul, expressing support for medical marijuana, said the drug war is "another war we ought to cancel.''
For viewers unfamiliar with Mr. Paul, he is giving them a glimpse of what a libertarian sounds like.
- 
9:45 P.M. | Gingrich Offers Risky Position on Immigration 
The political dangers of the immigration question are lurking again in a Republican debate.
Mr. Gingrich said he supported finding a way to allow the millions of illegal immigrants to stay in this country legally - without granting amnesty. 
"I'm prepared to take the heat for saying, 'Let's be humane about enforcing the law,' " Mr. Gingrich said.
He may well take the heat. That position was immediately jumped on by Mr. Romney and Mrs. Bachmann, both of whom decried it as amnesty, no matter what Mr. Gingrich calls it.
In an earlier debate, Rick Perry angered many conservatives by standing behind his policy of giving in-state tuition breaks to illegal immigrants and saying that anyone who didn't support that didn't "have a heart."
Now, Newt Gingrich - leading in the polls - is wading into the same waters.
And if history is any guide, Mr. Gingrich might find himself at odds with conservatives in Iowa and South Carolina with that position.
- 
9:34 P.M. | A Simple Fix for Immigration From Cain
An appealing trait of Herman Cain is his plain-spokenness.
One example is his very simple plan for solving the immigration problem, at least as it relates to Mexico.
1. "Secure the border for real."
2. "Enforce the laws that are there."
3. "Fix the immigration system."
4. "Empower the states."
Easy.
Mr. Cain did not elaborate about how he would accomplish any of those things, but stated them all very simply.
- 
9:29 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Obama and Israel 
Mitt Romney implied that the Obama administration had not shown that it cares about Israel.
The "right course," Mr. Romney said, is to "show that we care about Israel, that they are our friend - we'll stick with them."
"If I'm president of the United States, my first foreign trip will be to Israel to show the world we care about that country and that region," he said.
Mr. Romney and other G.O.P. candidates have argued during the campaign that Mr. Obama has turned his back on Israel, or even, as Mr. Romney has said, thrown it under a bus.
Politically, the candidates are eager to attract political and financial support from Jewish voters and donors, traditionally a strong base of support for Democrats. They are also competing to woo evangelical voters in the Republican Party who view unwavering support for Israel as a critical position.
But criticism that the Obama administration has neglected Israel ignores a lot. For example, the current Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, has stoutly praised Mr. Obama and his commitment to Israel's security.
Certainly, Mr. Obama has had differences with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu: He was overheard several weeks ago appearing to sympathize with a comment by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who said in a private conversation that Mr. Netanyahu was a "liar."
And many Republicans, including Mr. Romney, have attacked Mr. Obama for saying during a speech in May that the "borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed-upon swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states."
That was a shift - albeit subtle - in policy, many analysts said, in publicly endorsing using the borders before the 1967 war as a starting point for talks on a two-state solution. But the language was not extraordinary, as other administrations have pursued a deal between the two sides using the same borders, with mutually agreed-upon land swaps, as a basis for talks.
And while Mr. Netanyahu sharply criticized that speech, Mr. Obama has firmly taken Israel's side on a number of disputes, like vigorously opposing efforts to win recognition for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations.
Nor is it clear how many Israelis have misgivings about Mr. Obama. For example, Mr. Barak, a former prime minister who is also the most decorated soldier in the country's history, told CNN a few days ago that Mr. Obama had been an "extremely strong supporter of Israel in regard to its security."
"I don't think that anyone can raise any question mark about the devotion of this president to the security of Israel," Mr. Barak added.
- 
9:23 P.M. | Perry Calls for Panetta's Resignation in Face of Cuts 
It wouldn't be a Republican debate without a call for the resignation of an official in the Obama administration.
Enter Mr. Perry, who called on Leon Panetta, the secretary of defense, to resign rather than submit to automatic cuts in the defense budget.
Mr. Panetta is generally well-liked in Washington, even among Republicans. He was easily confirmed for the defense post after leading the C.I.A. during the period when Osama bin Laden was found and killed. 
But Mr. Perry seemed unmoved by his reputation, saying that resigning would be the honorable thing to do in the face of deep cuts at the Pentagon.
- 
9:21 P.M. | Fact Check: Perry on Aid to Pakistan
Mr. Perry asserted that the United States sends a blank check, with no strings attached, to Pakistan. But this year, the Obama administration is suspending and in some cases canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Pakistani military, in large part to chasten it for expelling American military trainers and failing to fight militants effectively.
Altogether, about $800 million in military aid and equipment - or more than one-third of the $2 billion the United States sends annually in security assistance to Pakistan - could be affected. The aid includes about $300 million to reimburse Pakistan for the costs of deploying more than 100,000 soldiers on its border with Afghanistan to combat terrorism.
- 
9:19 P.M. | A Chilean Model for Social Security Reform
Newt Gingrich and the other Republicans often criticize President Obama for basing his philosophy on what they call a European socialism.
So what is Mr. Gingrich's model for reform of the American entitlement system? 
How about the South American country of Chile? He says that its use of personal accounts for retirement should be the basis of Social Security reform in this country.
And just in case anyone accuses him of internationalism, Mr. Gingrich adds that he also likes a domestic model: Galveston, Tex. 
- 
9:13 P.M. | Reining In Gas Prices
Buck-a-gallon gas? 
Mr. Gingrich did not exactly promise that. But he suggested that the country was not doing what it could to curb steadily rising prices at the pump.
"If we were serious, we would open up enough oil fields in the next year that the price of oil would collapse," Mr. Gingrich said. "That's what we would do if we were serious."
He didn't say what exactly that means, or where he would drill. And he didn't confront questions about how fast - or not - the oil companies could actually make use of those oil fields.
But he called the bureaucracy in Washington "mindless" and said the government was standing in the way of much lower gas prices.
- 
9:11 P.M. | The Intricacies of Iran Sanctions 
How to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions got the candidates into the weeds of American sanctions law.
Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and other candidates called for the United States to impose formal sanctions on Iran's central bank. The Obama administration stopped short of that step in announcing new Iran sanctions on Monday. The reason is that formal sanctions would require the United States to cut off any foreign institution that does business with the central bank. China, Japan and South Korea all buy oil from Iran, processing those transactions through the central bank, and they are not likely to stop because of American sanctions. That would put the administration in the untenable position of cutting off the Bank of China and the Bank of Japan.
- 
9:08 P.M. | Fact Check: Israel and Iran
Mr. Paul is correct in saying that the recently retired head of Israel's Mossad spy agency has been highly critical of the idea of launching a pre-emptive strike against Iran, comments that have highlighted the sharp debate within Israel over using a military option to slow Iran's nuclear program.
Meir Dagan, who was in charge of Mossad until last January, said this summer that attacking Iran would be a "stupid idea."
He later added that it would bring "regional war."
"In that case," he said, "you would have given Iran the best possible reason to continue the nuclear program."
- 
9:09 P.M. | Continuing Humanitarian Aid to Africa
Should America continue to provide humanitarian aid to Africa, under programs that were expanded under the presidency of George W. Bush? 
Rick Santorum says yes. "I hear people up here talking about zeroing out foreign aid," he said, calling that "absolutely the wrong course."
But Mr. Paul disagrees. He said that giving aid to places like Africa is "worthless," and that the only thing that should be exported is American principles.
And Herman Cain said he's not sure: "It depends upon priorities. It depends upon looking at the program and asking: 'Has that money been worthwhile? I would like to see the results.' "
- 
9:07 P.M. | Fact Check: Obama, the C.I.A. and the A.C.L.U.
 Can you fact-check Bachmann's accusation of the C.I.A. and A.C.L.U.? 
@naeemac, via Twitter
 Mrs. Bachmann, who sits on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, asserted that President Obama "has essentially handed over our interrogation of terrorists to the A.C.L.U.'' 
She said the C.I.A. "has no ability to have any form of interrogation for terrorists," and gave as an example the so-called underwear bomber, who, after he was apprehended for trying to blow up a plane scheduled to land in Detroit, "was given Miranda warnings within 45 minutes.''
The first part of Mrs. Bachmann's statement was apparently a reference to President Obama's executive order shortly after his inauguration ordering the C.I.A.'s controversial "black site" prisons abroad shut down. However, according to news accounts, the C.I.A. continues to interrogate terrorism suspects abroad, including Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali accused of ties to Islamist militant groups, who was questioned for months aboard a United States naval vessel before being flown to New York this summer for trial.
As for Mrs. Bachmann's second statement, about the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was pulled off a jet in Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009, Mr. Abdulmutallab claimed in court that he had not been read his Miranda rights before being questioned in a hospital. An F.B.I. agent confirmed this account. Mr. Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty to all charges last month. 
- 
9:02 P.M. | Fact Check: My Name Is ...
 Romney says Mitt is his first name. Isn't it Willard?
Elliot, Cornwall, N.Y.
After the debate moderator, Wolf Blitzer, opened the program by giving a sample introduction - "I'm Wolf Blitzer, and yes, that is my real name," he said - and urging the candidates to do the same, Mitt Romney used his turn to make a joke.
"I'm Mitt Romney and yes, Wolf, that's also my first name," he said.
But that's not quite the case. In fact, Mr. Romney's full name is Willard Mitt Romney - making his first name Willard, not Mitt. He was named after J. Willard Marriott, the founder of the Marriott Hotel chain, and a close friend of Mr. Romney's father. (On internal campaign memos, he's frequently referred to by his initials - W.M.R.).
However, Mr. Romney goes by Mitt, and that's what his friends and staffers often call him. (Aides also call him "the Gov," referring to his time as the governor of Massachusetts.)
So, our final verdict: technically false, but basically true. 
- 
8:58 P.M. | Fact Check: Violence in Afghanistan
Violence is down in Afghanistan, according to the United States military, but aid groups disagree. There is no question that insurgents have been set back in the Taliban heartland of Helmand and Kandahar Provinces in southern Afghanistan, where there are tens of thousands of American soldiers and Marines. The question is what happens after America leaves.
- 
8:58 P.M. | Paul Breaks From Candidates and Dismisses Israel
Many of the Republican candidates have jumped all over Mr. Obama for not being sufficiently supportive of Israel.
But one of their own - Mr. Paul - goes much farther in dismissing Israel.
"I think they are quite capable of taking care of themselves," Mr. Paul said, noting that he would not help Israel in a pre-emptive attack against Iran and its nuclear weapons program.
And yet, Mr. Paul's fellow candidates - while disagreeing with him - did not jump all over him the way they have Mr. Obama.
- 
8:51 P.M. | Fact Check: How Big Is Pakistan?
 Gov. Romney just said that Pakistan is 6th largest country - based on what?
 asulaw, Phoenix 
According to the Central Intelligence Agency's World Factbook, the population of Pakistan makes it the sixth-largest country in the world, placing it between Brazil and Bangladesh. Its estimated population as of July 2011 was 187,342,721. So Mr. Romney is correct.
- 
8:48 P.M. | Huntsman and Romney Clash on Afghanistan 
The fight between Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Romney over Afghanistan has been brewing for some time, and seemed ready to spill over tonight.
Mr. Huntsman is steadfast in his belief that most American troops should come back sooner than Mr. Obama has decreed, while Mr. Romney is insistent that troops should stay longer.
Mr. Huntsman chided Mr. Romney for his repeated claim that he would listen to the commanders on the ground, saying that a president is commander in chief, and "ought to be informed by a lot of different voices."
Mr. Romney shot back, "The commander in chief makes that decision based on input from people who are closest to the ground."
Neither noted that Mr. Obama's decisions regarding Afghanistan were preceded by months and months of closed-door meetings and discussions with the generals that Mr. Romney cites so often.
- 
8:39 P.M. | Bachmann Calls Pakistan 'Too Nuclear to Fail'
Mrs. Bachmann scolded Mr. Perry for suggesting that the United States should simply stop writing checks to Pakistan, saying the country is "too nuclear to fail."
Mr. Perry repeated his pledge that as president he would end aid to countries that do not support America.
"To write a check to countries that are clearly not representing American interests is nonsensical," Mr. Perry said.
Mrs. Bachmann's responded, "With all due respect to the governor, I think that's highly naive."
- 
8:34 P.M. | A Still-Twirling Cain Stumbles on Blitzer's Name
Herman Cain apparently still has a lot twirling around in his head.
During an answer about racial profiling, Mr. Cain disputed the premise of the moderator, Wolf Blitzer, who had asked whether Muslim Americans should be subjected to extra screening at airports.
"No, Blitz, that's oversimplifying it," Mr. Cain said.
He caught his mistake a moment later, saying: "I'm sorry, Blitz. I meant Wolf," and then adding: "Since we're in a Blitz debate. Sorry, Wolf."
It was just days ago that Mr. Cain stumbled through an answer about Libya during an editorial board meeting. 
The problem, he said: "I've got all this stuff twirling around in my head."
- 
8:27 P.M. | Perry Accuses Obama of Intelligence Failures
Rick Perry said the Obama administration had been an "absolute failure" in collecting intelligence that could stop terrorism, apparently ignoring the administration's success against terrorism.
"This administration in particular has been an absolute failure," he said, in spending money to "be able to draw in that intelligence" that will stop terrorist acts. 
Mr. Obama, of course, ordered the assault that killed Osama bin Laden based on intelligence collected by the C.I.A. and other government agencies. 
The government also recently killed other terror leaders based on intelligence gathered during Mr. Obama's term.
- 
8:23 P.M. | Different Views on the Patriot Act
Two strains of conservative thought about security were on display early tonight on a question about the Patriot Act, offered up by Ed Meese, the attorney general under Ronald Reagan.
Newt Gingrich said he was all for strengthening the act, saying, "I think you want to use every tool you can possibly use."
Ron Paul disagreed, warning: "You can prevent crimes by becoming a police state. You might prevent a crime. But the crime then will be against the American people."
Michele Bachmann sided with Mr. Gingrich; Jon Huntsman sided - basically - with Mr. Paul, saying that America should remember that "we are a nation of values."
- 
8:13 P.M. | A Promise of Fairness From Wolf Blitzer
Wolf Blitzer made a pre-emptive strike against Jon M. Huntsman Jr., Michele Bachmann and some of their rivals, who have often complained about not getting enough attention.
"Candidates, I'll try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions," he said.
Mr. Huntsman and other candidates who are low in the polls have complained during other debates that they were treated unfairly. Mrs. Bachmann criticized CBS News after an e-mail surfaced suggesting that she might not get that many questions during a debate hosted by the network.
- 
8:05 P.M. | A Flashy Opening From CNN
The debate is under way, and CNN has decided to go grim for the intro: grainy black-and-white pictures of men at war and videos of presidents dealing with crises.
This is the year of the flashy openers for debates, which have taken cues from ball games - grab your audiences and ratings will soar. 
So far, it's working. The debates have had the best ratings ever.
- 
6:36 P.M. | All Eyes on Gingrich
The eight Republican candidates for president will take the stage in Washington tonight at 8, but all eyes will be on Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House.
Mr. Gingrich has swiftly risen in national polls in recent days, becoming the current threat to Mitt Romney's hopes of winning his party's nomination.
Debates have been Mr. Gingrich's strength, and his campaign is hoping to use tonight's face-off to help cement the idea that he has the best ideas for the country, especially when it comes to national security, the focus of the debate.
Mr. Romney is likely to try to keep the focus on President Obama on the day he unveiled his first attack ad.
Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, and Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, are hoping to jump-start their campaigns after flubs that have cost them support in the polls.
The debate will be broadcast on CNN. We'll be providing real-time analysis and fact-checking on our debate dashboard and also taking suggestions from readers for candidate statements that deserve a closer look. You can submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #asknyt or on the dashboard.

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney's First TV Ad

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A bit of creative editing results in a highly deceptive attack against the president. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney released his first television ad on Tuesday. He could have made a pretty powerful ad criticizing President Obama's handling of the economy and pointing out how high the unemployment rate is. Unfortunately, Mr. Romney wasn't satisfied with just the facts.
The ad splices together several quotes from a 2008 visit by Mr. Obama to New Hampshire, including this one: "If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose." The word "lose" echoes for several ominous seconds. I guess Mr. Romney wants everyone to take a sharp intake of breath and say, "Loooose. Ooooh."
Well, Mr. Obama did say those words, but the Romney campaign got a little creative with the editing. What he really said was, "Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose."
David Firestone, who covers politics and Congress for the editorial board sent me this note about the ad:
The ad immediately won the highly competitive "pants on fire" award from PolitiFact , but in defending it, the Romney campaign compounded the deception. Gail Gitcho, the campaign's communication director, explained on MittRomney.com that it was useful to seize on the quote, because "now, President Obama's campaign is desperate not to talk about the economy."
It's hard to get Mr. Obama to talk about anything else. For months he has been on the road pushing his prescription for economic growth, a jobs act that would cut middle-class taxes and increase spending on public works projects. Mr. Romney has a plan, too. It focuses more on cutting upper-income taxes and reducing spending on programs vital to the middle class and the poor.
Just yesterday, Mr. Obama went to the White House podium to lament the collapse of the supercommittee, talking about the need to keep the payroll tax cut and put construction workers and teachers back to work.
I like to think that, eventually, a campaign based largely on blatantly misleading advertising will annoy voters, but I'm never sure how long "eventually" will take.

HEADLINE: 3rd-Quarter U.S. Growth Revised Down to 2 Percent

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The United States economy grew at a slightly slower rate than previously estimated in the third quarter, but weak inventory accumulation amid sturdy consumer spending strengthened analysts' views that output would pick up in the current quarter. 
Gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, down from the previously estimated 2.5 percent.
The revision was below economists' expectations for a rate of 2.5 percent. But data showing consumer spending still firm and business inventories dropping for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2009 appeared to set the stage for a stronger economic performance this quarter.
Data so far suggests the fourth-quarter growth rate could exceed 3 percent, which would be the fastest in 18 months.
Despite the downward revision, the growth last quarter was still a step up from the 1.3 percent rate recorded in the April-June period. Part of the pickup in output during the last quarter reflected a reversal of factors that held back the economy earlier in the year.
A jump in gasoline prices weighed on consumer spending earlier in the year, and supply disruptions from the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March in Japan curbed auto production.
The government revised third-quarter output to account for an $8.5 billion drop in business inventories, which lopped 1.55 percentage points from G.D.P. growth. Inventories were previously estimated to have increased $5.4 billion.
The drag from inventories was offset by strong export growth. Excluding inventories, the economy grew at an unrevised rate of 3.6 percent after expanding 1.6 percent in the second quarter.
Consumer spending was revised down slightly to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent because of adjustments to motor vehicle fuels and lubricants. It was still the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 2010.
However, weak income growth could curtail spending. The report showed real disposable income fell 2.1 percent in the third quarter after declining 0.5 percent in the previous three months. There were also small revisions to business investment, which rose at a 14.8 percent rate instead of 16.3 percent as estimates for investment in nonresidential structures and outlays on equipment and software were lowered.
The Commerce Department also said after-tax corporate profits increased at a 3 percent rate after rising 4.3 percent in the second quarter.
Export growth was stronger than previously estimated, rising at a 4.3 percent rate instead of 4 percent. Imports increased at a much slower 0.5 percent rate rather than 1.9 percent.
Trade contributed almost half a percentage point to overall growth. Elsewhere, residential construction grew at a 1.6 percent rate instead of 2.4 percent.
The report showed inflation pressures subsiding. A price index for personal spending rose at a 2.3 percent rate in the third quarter, instead of 2.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Occupy at Berkeley

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Berkeley Crackdown Raises Fear of Move Backward'' (Bay Area edition, Nov. 18): 
As someone who participated in the Free Speech Movement as a student and who is now a member of the Berkeley faculty, I object to the impression left by your article that Occupy Cal is an extension of the substance, as opposed to the spirit, of the Free Speech Movement.
The current movement, by applying the language and symbolism of Occupy Wall Street, implies that the University of California at Berkeley is itself integral to the economic inequality against which Occupy Wall Street is directed.
This conflates two very different institutional complexes, grossly underestimates the role of U.C. Berkeley in advancing egalitarian goals, and implies that the definancing of higher education by voters and legislators is somehow the fault of the campus authorities and within their power to correct.
The ban on overnight camping is easily defended and does not impede political advocacy remotely as the pre-Free Speech Movement regulations did by governing what words could be said on campus and exactly where and when.
U.C. Berkeley is not an appropriate target for the current movement.

HEADLINE: How to Become a Big Fish In an Indie-Rock Aquarium

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
Jeffrey Lewis was crouched on the floor of his East Village apartment one recent evening, stuffing his self-made CDs and comic books into a backpack while his brother, Jack, prodded him to hurry. They had a gig to get to, and not a moment to spare.
A singer, illustrator and professional-grade neurotic, Mr. Lewis plays a jangly and verbose kind of folk-rock that he augments in concert by flipping through portfolios of his drawings. If that sounds unusual, get this: by pinching pennies and managing most of his business himself, he has built a stable, profitable career with albums that sell a fraction of what typically constitutes a hit.
''For some weird reason I'm surviving,'' he said. ''I've been making a good living for 10 years in the music industry. I own an apartment in the East Village; I've got a car. Whatever weird business practices I've been able to weasel out for myself, I'm still standing, unlike 90 percent of the other people that I've seen when I started out.'' 
On Friday Mr. Lewis and his band, the Junkyard, will play at the Mercury Lounge on the Lower East Side to promote his sixth major release, ''A Turn in the Dream-Songs'' (Rough Trade). Like its predecessors, the album mixes earnest takes on heartbreak with the extended, self-deprecating ego dissections that have earned him a reputation as something like the indie-rock Woody Allen.
''He manages to hit these things that have a familiarity about them,'' said Jarvis Cocker of the British band Pulp. ''These unspoken things that might be in people's minds but they would be too scared or uptight to say in conversation, let alone write a song about. He deals with quite risky subject matter sometimes -- risky to himself.''
Mr. Lewis's shaky, semispoken delivery and his band's ragged instrumentation give his music an air of tossed-off amateurism that obscures his tight, careful songwriting. The discipline with which he manages his business might also not be immediately apparent.
But as he and his brother drove to their show earlier this month -- at Purchase College, Mr. Lewis's alma mater, to a campus crowd of about 50 -- they described their fiscal strategies, like making their own merchandise and retaining ownership of albums. A ''hit'' record might sell only 5,000 copies, Mr. Lewis said, and by keeping costs minuscule he makes money on them.
''We're one of the few bands that actually has a functioning economy,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''We live based on how much people like us and buy our stuff and come to our shows.''
That philosophy extends to touring. Driving their 1991 Nissan, Jack Lewis, 31, who plays bass, stayed slightly under the speed limit and grimaced at the prospect of $6 parking.
Mr. Lewis, 36, grew up on the Lower East Side and still lives a block from his parents, in a co-op he bought for $23,000 down and ''a monthly rent that's so low it's embarrassing,'' he said. After graduating from Purchase in 1997 he began working on his comics but was also drawn to the Sidewalk Cafe on Avenue A, home of the long-running Antifolk singer-songwriter scene. Inspired by the lo-fi hero Daniel Johnston, Mr. Lewis was soon making cassette albums wrapped in his photocopied comics.
''I realized that you didn't really need anything but a tape recorder to make an album,'' he said. ''If you had songs you felt strongly enough about, you could just put them on tape, and hopefully people would like them.''
At Sidewalk he met Kimya Dawson and Adam Green of the Moldy Peaches, who followed Mr. Lewis's example but leapfrogged him on the way to wider renown, opening for the Strokes and appearing on the hit soundtrack to the 2007 film ''Juno.''
''I learned a lot about songwriting from Jeff,'' Ms. Dawson said. ''That it's O.K. to be vulnerable and awkward. And the stuff he was singing about was not just generic love stories, but things actually going on in his life. It blew my mind.''
New York City and the culture of music permeate Mr. Lewis's work. In 2001 he had his first blip of indie fame with ''The Chelsea Hotel Oral Sex Song,'' a takeoff on Leonard Cohen's ''Chelsea Hotel No. 2.''
But the aspect of New York that most engages Mr. Lewis's imagination is the intersection of bohemianism and leftist politics that shaped his parents' generation, as well as 1960s poet-musicians like Tuli Kupferberg of the Fugs, whom Mr. Lewis befriended before his death last year.
''Tuli felt like somebody that would fit right in at any of our family gatherings -- an old Lower East Side, Jewish socialist anarchist weird-poet type,'' said Mr. Lewis, who draws his father's tall tales and other New York stories in his self-published comic, Fuff. ''The books on his shelf were the same ones that my parents had.''
(Kupferberg makes a cameo appearance in the video for Mr. Lewis's 2005 song ''Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror,'' a rant about the meaning of fame when it comes to small fish and smaller ponds.)
From their parents, Mr. Lewis and his brother drew complementary values of principled labor and slacker thrift. Their mother was a social worker and adjunct professor. ''For our dad,'' Jack Lewis said, ''working as little as possible was the way to beat the system.''
Growing up, the dissonance between his family's socialist ideals and America's Russophobia led Mr. Lewis to a lifelong interest in Communism. He now recounts the history of Communism in Russia, China and North Korea in his illustrated song histories, long a highlight of his live shows. At the Purchase show, as he performed a biography of Marco Polo, rhyming as he flipped through his drawings, the students mellowed and drew close like toddlers at story hour.
Mr. Lewis's comics have occasionally attracted mainstream attention. In the last few years the History Channel has commissioned 10 Web videos based on his history songs, and in 2008 and 2009 he contributed to Measure for Measure, an opinion blog about songwriting on The New York Times Web site.
From the beginning Mr. Lewis's songs have been focused on love and fame, and the feelings that result from their presence or absence. ''A Turn in the Dream-Songs'' is no different, but it includes the closest thing to an anthem that Mr. Lewis could conceivably write: ''Cult Boyfriend,'' a musing on life on the subcultural fringes, where the numbers may be small but there's still room for happiness.
''I might not be in magazines as a heartthrob face,'' he sings in that song, ''but in a few devoted hearts I've found a strong fan base.''

PERSON: Paul Motian 

HEADLINE: Paul Motian, Drummer and Composer, Is Dead at 80

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
Paul Motian, a drummer, bandleader, composer and one of the most influential jazz musicians of the last 50 years, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was complications of myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood and bone-marrow disorder, said his niece, Cindy McGuirl.
Mr. Motian was a link to groups of the past that informed what jazz sounds like today. He had been in the pianist Bill Evans's great trio of the late 1950s and early 1960s and in Keith Jarrett's so-called American quartet during the 1970s. But it was in the second half of his life that Mr. Motian found himself as a composer and bandleader, with work that could be counterintuitive or straightforward, runic or crowd-pleasing. 
Stylish and alert -- he wore sunglasses in the dark and laughed often and loudly -- he worked steadily for decades, and for the last six years or so almost entirely in Manhattan. He had the support of the record producers Stefan Winter and Manfred Eicher, who released his music on the labels Winter & Winter and ECM, and of Lorraine Gordon, the proprietor and presiding spirit of the Village Vanguard, who booked him many times a year, either in his own groups or those of others. (In his 70s he grew tired of traveling, and anyway, he said, he preferred the sound of his drum kit at the Vanguard.)
The many musicians he played with regularly included the saxophonist Joe Lovano and the guitarist Bill Frisell, with whom he had a working trio; the pianist Masabumi Kikuchi; the saxophonists Greg Osby, Chris Potter and Mark Turner, with whom he played in trios and quartets; the members of the Electric Bebop Band, with multiple electric guitars, which in 2006 became the Paul Motian Band; and dozens of others, from developing players to old masters.
For nearly all of his bands, his repertory was a combination of terse and mysterious originals he composed at the piano, American-songbook standards and music from the bebop tradition of his youth by the likes of Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker and Charles Mingus.
Stephen Paul Motian (he pronounced his surname, which was Armenian, like the word ''motion'') was born in Philadelphia on March 25, 1931, and reared in Providence, R.I. In 1950 he entered the Navy. After briefly attending its music school in Washington, he sailed around the Mediterranean until 1953, when he was stationed in Brooklyn. He was discharged a year later.
He met Evans in 1955, and by the end of the decade he was working in a trio with him and the bassist Scott LaFaro. That group, in which the bass and drums interacted with the piano as equals, continues to serve as an important source of modern piano-trio jazz.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s Mr. Motian played with many other bandleaders, including Lee Konitz, Warne Marsh, Mose Allison, Tony Scott, Stan Getz, Johnny Griffin and, for a week, Monk. After leaving his partnership with Evans, he worked steadily with the pianist Paul Bley, whom he often credited with opening him up to greater possibilities.
''All of a sudden there was no restrictions, not even any form,'' he told the writer and drummer Chuck Braman in 1996. ''It was completely free, almost chaotic.''
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Bley recalled: ''We shared the same philosophy, musically. He knew that what he was doing in the past was not his answer. What he lived for was growth and change.''
Then, and even more with Mr. Jarrett's quartet in the 1970s, Mr. Motian moved away from swing-based rhythm; he improvised freely, or played off melodic form. Eager to grow beyond percussion, he studied and composed on a piano he had bought from Mr. Jarrett, and in 1973 he made a record of his own compositions for ECM, ''Conception Vessel,'' with Mr. Jarrett and others. One of the last records he made with Mr. Jarrett's quartet, ''Byablue'' (1977), consisted mostly of Motian originals.
But the old sense of swing never left, and it later became abundantly clear again, whether he was playing an original sketch built on uneven phrasing with gaps of silence or a root text of jazz like ''Body and Soul.'' Sometimes he would strip a beat to absolute basics, the sound of brushes on a dark-toned ride cymbal and the abrupt thump of his low-tuned kick drum. Generally, a listener could locate the form, even when Mr. Motian didn't state it explicitly.
''With Paul, there was always that ground rhythm, that ancient jazz beat lurking in the background,'' said the pianist Ethan Iverson, one of the younger bandleaders who played with and learned from him toward the end.
Mr. Motian's final week at the Vanguard was with Mr. Osby and Mr. Kikuchi, in September. ''He was an economist: every note and phrase and utterance counted,'' Mr. Osby said on Tuesday. ''There was nothing disposable.''
He is survived by his sister, Sarah McGuirl.

HEADLINE: World Bank Issues Alert On Afghanistan Economy

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Afghanistan will suffer a recession in 2014 and beyond after foreign troops leave and aid dwindles, and if the security situation gets worse, the country could face complete economic collapse, according to an ominous report released in Kabul on Tuesday by the World Bank.
The country's near-total dependence on aid -- more than 90 percent of the $17.1 billion national budget comes from foreign donations -- puts it in the company of Gaza, the West Bank and Liberia as one of the most aid-reliant places in the world, according to the World Bank. Much of the Afghan government's revenue is derived from American military and civilian spending. 
''Transition will have a profound impact on the economy and political landscape well after 2014,'' said Josie Bassinette, the acting country director for the World Bank, referring to the shift of responsibility for running every aspect of Afghan affairs to the Afghan government. She said the bank forecasts a $7 billion deficit in the Afghan budget annually through 2021.
Western diplomats who had been given private briefings on the report over the past week said the news was grim. ''We have an enterprise on our hands that is totally unsustainable from a fiscal point of view,'' one said.
Another diplomat recalled going to an American combat outpost last spring and asking an officer how many Afghans worked there; the officer replied that about 25 were involved in building projects at the post.
''What is going to happen next spring to those 25 people and their families when we pull up stakes?'' the diplomat said. ''Think about how many outposts there are like that.''
Over all, income per person in Afghanistan is $528 a year, but Ms. Bassinette said that figure conceals pockets of worse poverty because aid money has not been evenly spread: money has poured into unstable areas while bypassing more peaceful ones.
The World Bank forecast echoed a report last June by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which questioned the assumption that plentiful aid and higher incomes for local Afghans would foster security, a major part of the counterinsurgency strategy. Both reports raise the possibility that many foreign aid projects give little more than a temporary economic jolt to Afghans.
Afghanistan faces a difficult decision over whether to go ahead with plans to expand its security forces to 352,000 soldiers, or to scale back to leave more room in the budget for education, health care and infrastructure. There will not be enough money for both, the World Bank report indicates.
''If the security side is covered, the civilian side will suffer; if the civilian side is covered, security will suffer,'' Ms. Bassinette said.
The report is based on moderately optimistic assumptions, including the development of a large copper mine at Aynak in Logar Province and an iron mine in Bamian Province. Many Western observers doubt that the country will be secure enough to develop the mines and ship ore abroad any time soon.
Even if the mines begin to produce income, the country will run an annual deficit of $7 billion, and its economic growth will be 5 to 6 percent by 2018, considerably less than the current pace of 9 to 10 percent, the report forecast. Without the mines, growth will be slower still, about 4 percent a year, the bank said, and could fall to zero or below if security deteriorates.
The Afghan government's ambivalence about foreign aid further complicates humanitarian work. It wants the money but is sensitive about seeming unable to care for its people.
Recently a group of organizations, including Save the Children, Oxfam and CARE, released a statement saying that Afghans in 14 areas of the country were at risk of hunger and disease in the coming months because of drought and bad harvests, and would be unreachable after winter snows set in. Instead of welcoming the group's effort to raise money, Mohammed Asif Rahimi, the agriculture minister, appeared to take offense, viewing it as a criticism of his ministry's efforts. He held a news conference on Tuesday to berate the groups.
''Recent NGO fund-raising publicity has incorrect data and ignores the important progress so far,'' he said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to nongovernmental organizations.
Three coalition soldiers died in separate episodes in southern Afghanistan on Monday, according to a NATO statement.

HEADLINE: Fed Plans for Biggest Banks to Undergo New Stress Tests to Evaluate Soundness

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it was planning for the nation's biggest banks to undergo another round of stress tests to determine whether they are sound enough to raise their stock dividends or buy back shares.
Now in their second year, the reviews have quickly become an important tool to help regulators assess the condition of the banks and restore confidence in the financial system. They also have divided the industry between the strongest banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which were permitted to start increasing their dividends and repurchase billions of dollars' worth of shares this spring, and weaker institutions, like Bank of America, whose requests were denied.
The latest round of tests will give those banks another chance to convince regulators that they have regained their footing and can weather a range of unexpected financial shocks. Banks will have to complete the exams and make any requests to return capital to shareholders by Jan. 9. The Fed is expected to announce its decisions on those plans by early March. 
This time, a few new twists are planned.
Unlike the previous exams, which focused on financial conditions in the United States, the new tests will require several of the big Wall Street banks to assess the potential effect of a sudden downturn on European bank loans and sovereign debt. And in an attempt to provide investors with more information, the Fed will publish its revenue and loss estimates for each of the large banks it reviews.
The Fed will also expand the scope of the exams to 31 large banks, up from the 19 biggest.
Despite the fragile economy, federal regulators have been relatively sanguine about the recovery of the nation's banks, emphasizing that they have far more capital and cash on hand than they did in the months before the financial crisis in 2008.
On Tuesday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provided fresh evidence that the banking industry was working slowly through its problems when it released its report on third-quarter results. Profits for the nation's 7,436 lenders rose nearly 50 percent, to $35.3 billion, compared with the period a year ago, while the number of banks at risk of failure shrank for the second consecutive quarter. In the third quarter, regulators closed 25 banks and added only a few new ones to the at-risk list. The list of so-called problem banks stands at 844, down from 865 at the end of June.
With fewer attractive places to lend or invest, banks have been stockpiling billions of dollars of excess profits. In fact, retained earnings in the third quarter reached their highest level since the height of the boom in 2006. That may give banks a freer hand to return capital to shareholders than they had in 2010, when regulators took a relatively tough stance.
Under the guidelines released Tuesday, the Federal Reserve will again evaluate the ability of the 19 largest banks to withstand losses under a set of adverse economic conditions over the next two years. Among the hypothetical situations are ones in which unemployment rises at the average rate of the last several recessions, domestic and global economic output contracts significantly, and stock and bond prices plunge starting in the fourth quarter of 2011. Six of the 19 banks with large trading operations will be required to estimate potential losses from their exposure to European debt.
Fed officials, in turn, will assess the banks' internal capital management and any plans to increase stock dividends or buy back additional shares. The banks must show that they are strong enough to meet the new capital requirements from international accords and cope with worse-than-expected legal settlements tied to the mortgage and foreclosure mess.
The official stress tests will evaluate the condition of the 19 biggest banks, which have assets of at least $100 billion. Those include Wall Street giants like Citigroup and Morgan Stanley as well as large regional banks like PNC Financial and U.S. Bancorp. Banks owned by MetLife, the insurer, and Ally Financial, the consumer lender once known as GMAC, are also subject to the reviews.
But this year, the Fed has also ordered the next dozen largest lenders with assets of at least $50 billion to undergo what is essentially a do-it-yourself version of the exam. These institutions -- including Discover Financial, Northern Trust, and Zions Bancshares as well as the United States subsidiaries of several foreign banks, like BBVA, HSBC, and the Royal Bank of Scotland -- had not previously participated in formal stress tests.
They must make similar loss assumptions that will be validated by Fed officials. But the bar for the level of detail and analysis supplied by each of those banks is generally expected to be lower, given the size and scope of their activities. These stress tests, with those required for the 19 biggest banks, will help the Fed satisfy a new requirement for annual reviews of large financial companies under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill.

HEADLINE: The Savers and the Borrowers: Banks Relying on E.C.B. Loans

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Banks clamored for emergency funds from the European Central Bank on Tuesday, borrowing the most since early 2009 in a clear sign that the euro region's financial institutions are having trouble obtaining credit at reasonable rates on the open market.
Indebted governments among the 17 members of the European Union that use the euro are also finding it harder to borrow at affordable rates as investors lose confidence in their creditworthiness. 
In a Tuesday auction, the Spanish treasury, for example, was forced to sell three-month bills at a price to yield 5.11 percent, more than double the 2.29 percent interest rate investors demanded at a sale of similar Spanish securities on Oct. 25. Spain also sold six-month debt at 5.23 percent Tuesday, up from 3.30 percent in October.
Italy's 10-year bond yield, meanwhile, edged up once again -- to nearly 6.8 percent Tuesday -- as foreign investors withdrew their money from that debt-staggered country.
Together, the commercial banks' heavy reliance on the central bank to finance their everyday business needs, along with the growing borrowing burden for Spain and Italy, raise the risk of failure for some banks within the countries that use the euro and the danger that nations much larger than Greece could eventually seek a bailout or be forced to leave the euro currency union.
European stocks were down broadly on Tuesday's gloomy news. In the United States, stocks closed lower, too, but were not down as much as they had been before the International Monetary Fund announced at midday that it would extend a six-month lending lifeline to nations that might seek it in response to the euro zone crisis.
At the same time, though, the central bank continued to resist calls that it stretch its mandate and expand the money supply, as the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have done.
The European debt crisis has crimped the flow of funds to banks by raising doubts about the solvency of institutions with a large exposure to European government debt. In particular, American money market funds have severely cut back their lending to European banks in recent months, leading many institutions to turn to Europe's central bank.
Compounding the problem, many banks using the euro have also had trouble selling bonds to raise money that they can lend to customers. That raises the specter of a credit squeeze that could amplify an impending economic slowdown. In addition, some banks may fail if they are unable to raise short-term cash.
The central bank said Tuesday that commercial banks had taken out 247 billion euros, ($333 billion), in one-week loans, the largest amount since April 2009. And the 178 banks borrowing from the central bank on Tuesday compared with the 161 banks that borrowed 230 billion euros ($310 billion) last week.
Since 2008, the central bank has been allowing lenders to borrow as much as they want at the benchmark interest rate, which is now 1.25 percent. Banks must provide collateral. But the central bank is not supposed to prop up banks that are insolvent, only those that have a temporary liquidity problem.
And while the central bank has been buying bonds from countries like Spain and Italy to try to hold down their borrowing costs, the amount --195 billion euros ($263 billion) so far -- is modest compared with the quantitative easing employed by other central banks like the Fed.
A growing number of commentators say the European Central Bank should be authorized to buy government bonds at levels sufficient to stimulate the economy.
''It is essential to have a central bank free to use all the levers, including variants of quantitative easing,'' Adair Turner, chairman of Britain's bank regulator, the Financial Services Authority, told an audience in Frankfurt late Monday. The audience included Vitor Constancio, vice president of the central bank.
Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note Tuesday that ''the E.C.B. should embark on a quantitative easing program similar in scale to those undertaken by Japan, the U.S. and the U.K.''
''Doubling the current supply of liquidity,'' Mr. Koo said, ''would not trigger inflation and would enable the E.C.B. to buy that much more euro zone government debt.''
But there has been no sign the central bank will budge from its position that it is barred from financing governments, and that purchases of government bonds are justified only as a way of keeping control over interest rates and fulfilling the bank's main task to keep prices stable.
''By assuming the role of lender of last resort for highly indebted member states, the bank would overextend its mandate and shed doubt on the legitimacy of its independence,'' Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and a member of the central bank's governing council, said Tuesday in Berlin.
''To follow this path would be like drinking seawater to quench a thirst,'' he said.
Lucas D. Papademos, the new prime minister of Greece and a former vice president of the central bank, met with Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, when he visited the bank on Monday. The bank did not disclose details of their discussions, but Greece's fate is to a large extent in the central bank's hands. Because of its bond purchases, the central bank is the Greek government's largest creditor, and the bank is one of the institutions that determines whether Greece will continue to receive aid from the 17 European Union members that use the euro.

HEADLINE: Taking No New Action, Fed Hopes for More Policy Mileage From Clearer Communication

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is moving toward providing more information on its goals and expectations as a way of helping investors predict the direction of its policies, according to the minutes of the November meeting of its policy-making committee.
The central bank intends to focus on improving communication, which it believes could amplify the effect of its existing policies, before considering new steps to foster growth, according to the account of the meeting, which the Fed published Tuesday after a standard delay. 
While the economy remains weak and more than 25 million Americans cannot find full-time work, the Fed has taken only small steps to stimulate the economy since June. And the minutes -- actually an extended description of its Nov. 1-2 meeting rather than a transcript -- make clear that a broad majority of the 10 voting members of the committee does not support more drastic action at the present time.
The minutes make little reference to proposals for new rounds of asset purchases, like buying larger amounts of government securities, the controversial strategy to lower long-term interest rates known as quantitative easing.
''There was little support for more quantitative easing, at least not before the communications review is concluded,'' Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Tuesday.
The November meeting was the first time since the summer that the Fed announced no new actions to support the economy. The committee said in a statement after the meeting that the economy was showing signs of modest improvement, though it also reduced its forecast for growth for the next two years.
The minutes of the meeting underscore the central bank's diminished expectations for economic activity.
''Participants generally agreed that, even with the positive news received over the intermeeting period, the most probable outcome was a moderate pace of economic growth over the medium run with only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate,'' the minutes say.
The document also notes that events in Europe could undermine the health of the domestic economy.
Against that bleak backdrop, a growing number of economists have called for the Fed to embrace more aggressive policies to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. In addition to new asset purchases, the central bank could seek to spur investment and job creation by expanding the money supply and accepting a higher rate of inflation.
But the Fed, already fretful that prices are increasing more quickly than it had expected, has shown little urgency in considering additional actions. The minutes note that members generally agreed that the central bank instead should focus first on improving its communications.
''A few members indicated that they believed the economic outlook might warrant additional policy accommodations,'' the minutes say. ''However, it was noted that any such accommodation would likely be more effective if it were provided in the context of a future communications initiative.''
Only one of the committee's 10 voting members dissented from this logic. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reiterated his public position that the high rate of unemployment required more immediate and forceful action by the central bank. He said the Fed should commit to maintaining low interest rates until unemployment drops below 7 percent.
The Fed already has said that it intends to hold short-term rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013, and most likely even longer. And there is broad support, according to the minutes, for formalizing this type of prediction by regularly publishing a forecast of short-term rates. That idea has been placed in the hands of a subcommittee headed by the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
Because the Fed can move the level of short-term interest rates, it can extend its influence by shaping the expectations of investors. For example, convincing investors that it intends to keep interest rates near zero for a longer period will tend to drive down rates on long-term loans, because those rates are set in large part based on expectations about short-term rates over the course of the loans.
There is less agreement about proposals to formalize rules for the management of monetary policy. Some Fed members, including its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have long favored the idea of formalizing a long-term inflation target of 2 percent. Others, including Mr. Evans, are pushing for temporary targets for unemployment and inflation to clarify the Fed's near-term objectives.
The committee dismissed the idea of adopting a new benchmark, like a commitment to pursue stimulus until the nation's economic output recovers from the recession. Such an approach is favored by a vocal chorus of outside economists, but has little support inside the institution, because of concern about the consequences of accepting more rapid inflation.
The verdict was reported in the Fed's typically understated style: ''Participants agreed that it would not be advisable to make such a change under the present circumstances.''

HEADLINE: Public Opinion and Executive Pay

BYLINE: By EDWARD HADAS, AGNES T. CRANE and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
One of the most puzzling British and American trends in the last three decades is the vast increase in the share of national income allocated to the very rich. The High Pay Commission, a nongovernmental body in Britain, which published a report on Tuesday, points out that the share of British national income garnered by the top 0.1 percent of earners has moved from 1.3 percent to 6.5 percent since 1979. The commission has a 12-point plan to change things.
The puzzle is twofold. First, what caused the shift? Companies may be bigger, but corporate bosses do pretty much what they always did. They're just getting paid much more to do it. At BP, one of the few big British companies with clear records going back to 1979, the top boss received 16 times as much as the average worker in 1979. Last year, BP's ''boss-peon'' multiple was 63. 
Second, why has there been so little public indignation about the pay extravaganza? The report's foreword says ''the public is rapidly running out of patience,'' but in fact this trend has been in place for decades, was not halted by the recession and has not fired up a mass protest movement. There are rhetorical expressions of outrage from politicians and at the public, but the British, like the Americans, seem remarkably complacent about the triumph of the elite.
While the why of high executive pay is a mystery, there's no real puzzle about the how. Year after year, directors approve above-inflation pay increases. The commission's proposals are all aimed at throwing grit in the fast-moving remuneration wheels. They are mostly worthy and reasonable -- more disclosure, more say from shareholders and employees and fewer conflicts of interest.
But the rich, a group that includes most board members and shareholder representatives, knows how to take care of its own. New rules can easily be skirted or neutered. A trend as well established as this can be halted only by a new social attitude. When pay-bashing becomes a serious vote-winning issue, things will change. Until then, reformers are unlikely to make much progress.
Leveraging Pensions
Public pension funds are in a pickle. Lackluster returns and underfunding have left their $2.3 trillion in assets inadequate to cover all future obligations. In addition, American pension fund managers can no longer count on the 8 percent annual return typically assumed for the future. Rather than bringing expectations down to earth, some are considering borrowing to bolster returns.
The 8 percent assumption is hard to justify. Using an asset mix typical of big pension funds and assuming the continuation of returns of the last five years, a more reasonable target would be around 4 percent. But without big extra contributions, that's going to make funding shortfalls even worse.
To close the gap, some managers are exploring the dangerous idea of leverage. One approach would shift funds out of the typical stock allocation of just over 50 percent and into a new bucket of supposedly safe fixed-income assets. Managers would then lever up this allocation, borrowing, say, $3 for every dollar of the fund's money to buy more assets and turbo-charge returns.
Suppose about half the typical existing equity allocation is treated this way. The difference between a traditional fixed-income annual return of 6.7 percent and a cost of borrowing of, say, just under 3 percent allows this part of the portfolio to deliver annual returns better than 15 percent to the fund. Add in the other unlevered assets and the potential combined return tops the 8 percent hurdle.
Yet recent events in Europe have shown that even highly rated sovereign bonds can be risky. And leverage makes any losses worse for the underlying fund. Moreover, if pension funds borrow, they will be more vulnerable to rising interest rates, which would bring bond values down and financing costs up. And pension fund managers aren't experts at making leveraged bets. Sure, they invest in private equity and hedge funds. But that's probably already enough debt exposure for what should be ultra-safe retirement funds.
If fund managers admit an 8 percent return is no longer achievable, struggling states and employees will have to make up the difference. That would be unpopular and difficult to pull off. But playing with leverage could easily turn out worse.

HEADLINE: If You Can't Trust Caller ID...

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Caller ID has been celebrated as a defense against unwelcome phone pitches. But it is backfiring.
Telemarketers increasingly are disguising their real identities and phone numbers to provoke people to pick up the phone. ''Humane Soc.'' may not be the Humane Society. And think the I.R.S. is on the line? Think again.
Caller ID, in other words, is becoming fake ID.
''You don't know who is on the other end of the line, no matter what your caller ID might say,'' said Sandy Chalmers, a division manager at the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection in Wisconsin. 
Starting this summer, she said, the state has been warning consumers: ''Do not trust your caller ID. And if you pick up the phone and someone asks for your personal information, hang up.''
Regulators in Wisconsin and many other states are hearing a significant jump in complaints about what is often called ''caller ID spoofing'' or ''call laundering.''
The rise of such tactics has prompted the Federal Trade Commission, which already prohibits telemarketers from masking their identity, to consider new rules. And last year, the Federal Communications Commission introduced rules to strengthen enforcement against the practice, and law enforcement officials in many states are working on other ways to combat it.
Such efforts have done little, though, to help people like Thomas Harbon, 74, a retired computer science professor who lives in Anderson, Ind. He has complained several times to state officials about the spate of calls that have made him distrustful of caller ID.
Sometimes, the calls appear to come from his town. Lately, if he is curious enough to pick up, he hears a recorded voice from someone named Rachel offering help with credit card interest rates.
''Sometimes it looks legitimate, and I'll pick up and hear 'This is Rachel from...' and that's about all she gets because I cut it off,'' Mr. Harbon said.
Several federal rules prohibit forms of caller ID spoofing and laundering. Under the Truth in Caller ID Act, passed last year and enforced by the F.C.C., it is illegal to transmit inaccurate or misleading caller ID information ''with the intent to defraud, cause harm or wrongfully obtain anything of value.''
The F.C.C. said it has received complaints about caller ID spoofing, but declined to say whether it is investigating any of them.
Privacy and consumer advocates say caller ID spoofing started on a small scale several years ago, but has risen sharply recently. The authorities say many spoofers are debt collectors or companies that promise to help consumers reduce their credit card payments or other debts.
Julie Schultz, 46, a homemaker in Chicago, started getting 30 calls a week from debt collectors in the spring of 2010, after a run of bad luck, including a car accident that severely injured her husband, left her family unable to make its minimum credit card payments.
But the calls typically showed up on her caller ID as a string of zeros, a local number without a name or even, in one case, ''Humane Soc.''
''They want you to pick up that phone because you think it's somebody else or an important call that you're expecting,'' Ms. Schultz said. She has hired a lawyer who has taken on a handful of clients suing telemarketers.
As laws have tightened, technology has made it easier for spoofers to cloak themselves and avoid getting caught.
For instance, law enforcement officials say, it is easy to route a call onto the Internet and back onto the public telephone network, thereby masking the call's origin. Companies can also use free software or inexpensive services to have a fictitious name appear on caller ID.
These services are often used for legitimate reasons by companies wanting to identify themselves to callers, but they can also be used to create aliases.
Automated dialing technology, known as robocalling, which lets telemarketers place thousands of calls per second, has added to the problem of caller ID spoofing.
The trade commission has received an explosion of complaints about telemarketing and robocalls. In September, it received 140,000 complaints about prerecorded robocalls, more than double the 61,000 complaints in the same month a year ago, the agency said.
In addition, the F.T.C. said on Tuesday that it had filed a complaint against a company that it said violated its rules prohibiting the use of robocalling by telemarketers and the masking of caller ID.
The agency said Sonkei Communications sold robocall services to telemarketers that generated tens of thousands of consumer complaints. The telemarketers sold home security systems, credit card services and programs, using caller ID readouts that said ''Service Message'' or ''Service Announcement,'' the F.T.C. said. Sonkei Communications could not be reached for comment.
Law enforcement officials around the country said they were also seeing more fake caller IDs. ''It's just grown and grown,'' said Marguerite Sweeney, the head of telephone privacy enforcement for the Indiana attorney general.
She said the state had heard from about 5,000 residents this year complaining about some form of caller ID spoofing.
The tricks are getting more sophisticated, she added.
In some cases, consumers complain that when they call back the number on their phone, they hear an automated recording for a ''do not call'' list, offering to take the caller's number.
Ms. Sweeney said she assumed the scheme was intended to gather numbers of people who might be willing to entertain a telemarketing pitch.
In other cases, she said, a number shows up on caller ID from a legitimate local business that is being used as a cover for a telemarketing pitch.
''Some random business or a person will call us and say, 'I'm getting irate calls from people saying I'm dialing them,' '' she said.
In North Carolina, officials said they were seeing big growth in caller ID spoofing from companies promising to consolidate credit card debt and, more recently, marketers selling what they claim are inexpensive medical products to treat diabetes.
When the state tries to trace the numbers, officials say, they wind up following a labyrinth that leads to China, Panama or the Philippines. They have also heard of cases of caller ID reading ''F.B.I.'' or ''I.R.S.''
For the most part, according to consumer advocates, the problem has been relegated to landlines. But they worry it threatens to spread to cellphones if proposed legislation passes that would allow businesses to use robocalls to reach consumers on their cellphones.
Advocates for the legislation, the Mobile Information Call Act, say it is necessary because a growing number of Americans use only cellphones or rarely use landlines anymore. Under the legislation, businesses and nonprofit organizations could reach people on their cellphones to ''deliver information calls for commercial purposes.''
Attorney General Greg Zoeller of Indiana, who testified before Congress against the legislation, said he worried that the proposed rules threaten to pre-empt states from prohibiting sales pitches by cellphone. And then, he worries, caller ID on cellphones will be taken over by fake ID's.
''The misuse of this could have people afraid to answer their cellphones the way they have their landlines,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stock Exchange To Acquire Osaka Rival

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO - The Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan's largest, on Tuesday announced a $1.1 billion merger deal with the Osaka Securities Exchange that would create the world's third-largest exchange, as measured by the value of listed stock 
The deal, which would unify the two exchanges by January 2013, is a bid to keep up with stiff competition among global market operators and to put Japanese equities back on the world map.
With listed stocks worth about $3.6 trillion, the new exchange would trail only NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, both based in New York, according to Reuters.
The merger deal, which comes after months of difficult negotiations, aims to reverse a decline in Tokyo's standing as a global financial center. The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in its heyday in the late 1980s was by far the world's largest, has since seen trading slump in tandem with the Japanese economy.
The Topix index is down 75 percent since the peak of Japan's asset bubble, in December 1989. Japan fell behind China as the world's second-largest equity market in 2008.
With a home market still dogged with economic stagnation, the outlook for Japanese equities has become increasingly dismal. Trading volumes have tumbled by half since a rally in 2006 and 2007, and hit a new low for the year in October.
Competition for investment dollars, meanwhile, has heightened as the world's stock exchanges have joined forces to bolster their offerings and save on costs. A proposed merger of Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext, if approved by the European Union, would create the world's largest exchange operator.
The Tokyo and Osaka exchanges have struggled to persuade overseas companies to list in Japan. Of the roughly 2,300 companies listed on all sections of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, only 12 are non-Japanese. No new foreign companies listed in 2010.
A $140 million high-speed trading system introduced by the Tokyo Stock Exchange last year, intended to attract hedge funds and other high-frequency traders to Japan, has done little to lift trading volumes.
''For a Japanese stock exchange to survive such global competition as a player,'' the Tokyo and Osaka exchanges said in a joint statement, ''it must establish a highly liquid and efficient market and enhance the convenience of investors and companies'' through economies of scale, more services and lower costs.
The two exchanges appear to be a good match: Tokyo dominates the cash equity market in Japan, while Osaka specializes in derivatives trading. By combining trading systems, the new exchange expects to save 7 billion yen ($91 million) a year in operating costs.
Atsushi Saito, chief executive of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will head the new exchange, tentatively named the Japan Exchange Group, the statement said. Michio Yoneda, the head of the Osaka Securities Exchange, will become chief operating officer.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Some Marketers, Brand Investment Beats Black Friday

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE holiday shopping season this year is playing out like a tale of two Christmases, giving marketers a, well, dickens of a time figuring out how best to reach consumers: hype the sale or bolster the brand.
Many marketers are addressing the continuing concerns about the economy with ads promoting ''our best Black Friday savings,'' ''the Thanksgiving event'' and ''Black Friday deals week.'' The volume of such ads is intensifying as more retailers decide to open at midnight on Friday, or even on Thanksgiving Day.
But some marketers worry that ads that seem obsessed with lower prices and bargain merchandise could leave consumers confused about what represents the ''best'' value. Those marketers prefer to run ads that burnish brand and product images, particularly when they can add messages that wish consumers a merry Christmas or a happy holiday season. 
''We do some Black Friday stuff, but it's not the big focus area,'' said Volker Kuhn, general manager for North America of the Duracell battery brand sold by Procter & Gamble. Rather, he added, he prefers to build brand equity by taking a long-range approach.
''Investing in the brand and the product is what makes you strong,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''The holidays are a very important season,'' he added, accounting for 35 percent of annual sales.
So Duracell is introducing an upbeat brand campaign called the Holiday Insurance Program, which is centered on the Duracell fan page on Facebook. The campaign includes reviews of toys from ''real kids,'' donations to the Toy Industry Foundation and a Chris Daughtry concert on the fan page on Dec. 14; Facebook members who ''like'' the page can watch the concert.
Mr. Daughtry ''is a great spokesman for us,'' Mr. Kuhn said, because he uses batteries ''professionally, for his microphones and guitars,'' and he is also ''a father of four kids.''
Like Duracell, the Nestle Purina PetCare unit of Nestle plans to concentrate on brand-building for the holidays. The company will run on Thursday its first commercial for a product called Purina Veterinary Diets FortiFlora canine nutritional supplement. The spot, by Colle & McVoy in Minneapolis, part of MDC Partners, will appear during ''The National Dog Show Presented by Purina'' on NBC as well as online.
The commercial features Mishka, a ''talking'' Husky whose videos are popular on YouTube; one, in which Mishka says, ''I love you,'' has more than 60 million views.
The commercial is aimed at ''real dog enthusiasts'' and ''the animal lover,'' said Greg Wetzel, group creative director at Colle & McVoy. ''Maybe it will pique their curiosity more than something on sale.''
Sue Haddrill, director for veterinary marketing at Nestle Purina PetCare in St. Louis, said: ''By utilizing Mishka, we really believe our spot will be memorable and appeal to family members of all ages. They'll have the show on and someone will say, 'Hey mom, did you see that?' ''
A very different brand taking the image-burnishing route is Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, sold by the Brown-Forman Corporation. Jack Daniel's is introducing a television, online and poster campaign, with a budget estimated at $10 million, that celebrates Christmas with a 26-foot ''barrel tree'' assembled from 140 barrels of Jack Daniel's at the brand's home in Lynchburg, Tenn.
''We hope it will be the start of a new tradition,'' said Carmen D'Ascendis, director of global marketing for Jack Daniel's at Brown-Forman in Louisville, Ky. The Jack Daniel's campaign is being created by Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Havas Worldwide unit of Havas.
''There are a lot of commercials that become part of the celebration,'' said Wade Devers, global creative director on the Jack Daniel's brand at Arnold. ''They all add to the feeling of the season.''
''The Norelco Santa; I'll never forget that,'' he added, referring to the long-running spot that showed Santa Claus using an electric shaver as a sleigh. ''To be part of that would be great.''
Several marketers are seeking to make their sale-centric ads more appealing -- and perhaps less mercenary -- by mixing humor with the deal spiels.
For instance, T-Mobile USA declared last Saturday to be ''Magenta Saturday,'' offering sales on smartphones and tablets. The campaign replaced ''black'' with the T-Mobile brand color, magenta.
In another color change, Gander Mountain, an outdoor retailer, is proclaiming Thanksgiving Day to be its first ''Camo Thursday,'' as in camouflage, with deals on its Web site ''that no one could see coming.'' The Gander Mountain campaign, which is created internally, will be repeated each Thursday until Christmas.
A humorous campaign for Target, from Wieden & Kennedy, brings back a brash, bargain-hunting character named the Christmas Champ, whose ardor for Black Friday is alternately appealing and appalling.
And in a spot for the Macy's department store chain owned by Macy's Inc., men who encounter Justin Bieber on his way to the Macy's Black Friday sale scream and squeal like preteenage girls. The spot was created by the JWT New York division of JWT, part of WPP.
Retailers that want to increase participation in Black Friday are ''trying to make it look like a party, like an amusement park ride,'' said Lisa Lee Freeman, editor in chief at ShopSmart magazine, which is published by Consumer Reports.
And ''they're doing it double time this year,'' Ms. Freeman said, ''because they're so worried'' that the economy has left shoppers ''in a more prudent frame of mind.''

PERSON: George Gallup Jr. 

HEADLINE: George Gallup Jr, 81; Expanded Polling Firm

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
George Gallup Jr., who led the firm that his father made all but synonymous with polling and expanded it to become a barometer of Americans' views on religion as well as their political attitudes, died on Monday in Princeton, N.J. He was 81 and lived in Princeton.
He learned he had liver cancer a year ago, his daughter Alison said. 
Mr. Gallup had once considered becoming an Episcopal priest, and after graduating from Princeton with a degree in religion in 1953, he went to Texas to work in a ministry on Galveston Island. But the pull of the family enterprise proved stronger, and he joined his older brother, Alec, at his father's firm, serving as an executive from the mid-1950s until his retirement in 2004.
While Mr. Gallup lamented late in his life that politicians follow polls rather than their conscience, he echoed his father in arguing that polling was vital to democracy. ''It's removed power out of the hands of special interest groups,'' he said in an interview on PBS a few years ago. ''It's given people who wouldn't normally have a voice a voice.''
Surveying American views on schools, families and institutions, he used the results to paint a portrait of the nation. ''The mood of America is one of disillusionment,'' he declared in 1973 as Watergate dragged down the approval ratings of President Richard M. Nixon and Congress alike.
Much of his work involved traditional political polls. But he also expanded the firm's surveys into religion, becoming one of the first pollsters to ask questions about organized religion and religious teachings and practice.
His research on religion ''was way before its time,'' said Andrew Kohut, who was president of the Gallup Organization from 1981 to 1989 and is now president of the Pew Research Center. ''That's where his heart rested, in part because he was torn between the ministry and following in his father's footsteps.''
In 1977, Mr. Gallup founded the Princeton Religion Research Center with Miriam Murphy, a sociologist and nun, to explore ''the nature and depth of religious commitment'' through polling.
In a speech that year, he described ''a groundswell of interest in religion'' as a result of a growing number of evangelicals across several denominations.
His surveys also formed the basis for several books on spirituality and religion, including ''The Search for America's Faith'' and ''The Saints Among Us.'' ''Adventures in Immortality,'' published in 1982, reported that 46 percent of Americans believed that there is life on other planets, and that 24 percent believed they could contact the dead.
George Horace Gallup III was born on April 9, 1930, in Evanston, Ill., where his father was working at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. He was known professionally as George Jr. ''to show that I'm my dad's son,'' he explained in an interview in May with the American Association for Opinion Research. ''I'm still Junior, and that's the way I want it.''
His father -- those who worked for them called him Dr. Gallup to distinguish older from younger -- founded the firm in 1935 and made his reputation by predicting Franklin D. Roosevelt's victory over Alf Landon in 1936 (though he suffered a setback, along with other pollsters, in predicting Dewey over Truman in 1948).
The younger Mr. Gallup married Kingsley Hubby in 1959. She died in 2007. His brother, Alec, died in 2009. Besides his daughter Alison, he is survived by another daughter, Kingsley; a son, George IV; a sister, Julia Gallup Laughlin; and two grandchildren.
In 1988, the family sold Gallup to Selection Research, a market research firm based in Nebraska. As a condition of the sale, Gallup established the George H. Gallup Foundation, a nonprofit organization, through which Mr. Gallup and his wife convened an annual Ideas for Progress seminar, seeking solutions to social problems that polls had identified.

HEADLINE: Forstmann Equity Firm To Name New Leader

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Julian H. Robertson Jr., the hedge fund manager, is expected to be named chairman of Forstmann Little, succeeding Theodore J. Forstmann, the co-founder of the private equity firm and prominent financier who died Sunday. 
Forstmann Little, which has largely wound down its operations, still has three investments in its portfolio: IMG, the sports, fashion and media company; 24 Hour Fitness, a health club chain; and ENK International, a fashion-industry trade-show business.
Mr. Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management, a pioneering hedge fund, will oversee the firm's holdings, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Mr. Forstmann designated Mr. Robertson as his successor before he died, these people said.
A large part of Mr. Robertson's job will be to sell the firm's remaining businesses. Forstmann's fund formally expires on June 30, 2012, and it is contractually required to sell the assets and return proceeds to its limited partners by then. But the firm has been in conversations with its limited partners about extending the deadline to allow for the best possible sale price for the fund's assets, which, given the current state of the economy, could take a year or two beyond the deadline, these people said. Most of the limited partners have indicated their willingness to let the deadline lapse, these people said.
Separately, IMG is expected to name Michael J. Dolan, the company's current president and chief operating officer, as its new chairman and chief executive, replacing Mr. Forstmann in those posts, these people said. Mr. Dolan, who was brought in by Mr. Forstmann, was the former chief financial officer of Viacom and helped lead the spinoff of Viacom from CBS. While no exit strategy for IMG has been determined, the company is expected to consider an initial public offering or sale, or a combination of both, in the next 18 months, these people said.
Mr. Dolan will take control of a business that over the last decade has grown from a sports agency that managed athletes' careers to an entertainment conglomerate that manages and produces thousands of events, like the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York and the World Snowboarding Championships in Oslo. It still represents some of the world's most prominent athletes, like the professional football players Peyton Manning and Eli Manning, and the tennis players Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova.
In recent years, the firm has made an aggressive push to develop sports markets in fast-growing international economies. IMG forged a deal with the Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista to build its business in Brazil, which is hosting the soccer World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. The firm also struck an agreement with Reliance Industries, the Indian conglomerate owned by Mukesh Ambani, to expand professional soccer and basketball leagues in India.
IMG was the last, big investment made by Mr. Forstmann, the pioneering private equity deal maker who died of brain cancer Sunday at the age of 71. He paid $750 million for IMG in 2004 and became its chairman.
A spokesman for Forstmann Little and IMG declined to comment.

HEADLINE: As Surprised Opponents Protest, South Korea Pushes U.S. Trade Pact Through Parliament

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL -- Members of President Lee Myung-bak's governing party, coughing from tear gas sprayed by an opposition legislator, rammed a free-trade agreement between South Korea and the United States through Parliament on Tuesday, ratifying a deal that has sharpened a political divide between the government and the opposition and between big business and voters unhappy with deepening economic inequality.
Lawmakers of the governing Grand National Party caught the opposition by surprise by calling a snap plenary session. Opposition legislators rushed in but were too late to prevent their rivals from putting the bill to a vote.
In a desperate attempt, one opposition lawmaker detonated a tear gas canister, throwing the National Assembly chamber into chaos. A scuffle erupted, but members of the governing party outnumbered their foes and, while sneezing and wiping tears, passed the deal in a vote of 151 to 7. In the 299-seat National Assembly, 170 members showed up for the vote Tuesday, most of them governing party lawmakers. The opposition members either voted against the bill or abstained. 
Glass doors were shattered as legislative aides from the opposition parties tried to barge in, and security guards formed a human barricade.
''The legislators were passing a bill which will make ordinary people shed bitter tears,'' Kim Sun-dong, a member of the small opposition Korea Democratic Labor Party, told a crowd of supporters on Tuesday night, explaining why he had sprayed tear gas. ''So I detonated tear gas so that they too shed tears, even if theirs were fake tears.''
Thousands of activists marched down an eight-lane boulevard in downtown Seoul late Tuesday, calling the parliamentary vote a ''violation of democracy'' and pledging to punish those who voted for the bill in next April's general election. Police officers fired water cannons to disperse them.
The government had urged quick approval of the deal, first signed in 2007 but long unratified by either country, arguing that it would help the economy grow. It also said the deal would lessen South Korea's dependence on trade with China and deepen its alliance with the United States at a time of growing military threats from North Korea.
The opposition argued that the deal would fatten the pockets of big export companies, which dominate the economy, while depriving farmers and small merchants of their livelihoods. Amid widespread distrust of big business and resentment of what is seen as increasing economic inequality, such fears have led thousands of farmers and labor activists to hold almost daily protest rallies outside the Parliament building. In occasional clashes, the police fired water cannons at protesters to stop them from entering Parliament.
''The government will actively pursue measures for farmers and smaller business owners to help improve their competitiveness,'' said Choe Guem-nak, the president's spokesman. ''We will also make sure that the free trade agreement will rejuvenate the economy and above all, create jobs for young people.''
Mr. Lee's rapport with President Barack Obama bore fruit last month when the U.S. Congress passed the free-trade deal by a wide margin despite underlying concerns about the effect it might have on U.S. manufacturing, notably the car industry. The deal was approved by Congress while Mr. Lee was visiting Washington.
''This was an inevitable action we had to take, because we could not make one step of progress in our talks with the opposition, which thought only about its partisan interest,'' Kim Ki-hyun, a governing party spokesman, said of the hurried vote. ''But we apologize to the people for failing to have a negotiated approval of the deal.''
''We apologize to the people for failing to stop this coup,'' said Sohn Hak-kyu, head of the main opposition Democratic Party. ''From now on, we will fight to have the deal nullified.''
Farmers' groups across the country issued statements accusing the government of ''giving up our economic sovereignty.''
The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in a statement welcoming the bill's approval that the deal would ''pave an economic highway'' to the United States and make South Korea a trading hub for Asia, Europe and North America.
South Korea, a major exporter of industrial goods like automobiles and consumer electronics, has aggressively sought free-trade deals and has several in effect, with countries including Chile, India, the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union. South Korea hopes the deal with the United States will go into effect Jan. 1, said Cho Byung-jae, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.
After Mr. Obama signed the U.S. side of the South Korean agreement into law, Mr. Lee's government has felt the pressure to get it ratified here, too. But weeks of negotiations became bogged down in squabbling over technicalities few ordinary South Koreans could understand.
The governing and opposition camps both admitted that it had become politically impossible to reach a compromise, especially after the opposition rejected Mr. Lee's offer last week that his government would renegotiate a key sticking point if the opposition first ratified the trade deal.
A violent clash was inevitable, given the parties' penchant for resorting to physical confrontations to railroad measures through Parliament. The rival parties focused on how to use such a clash to create a favorable impression for themselves before parliamentary and presidential elections next year.
Government economists believe that the free-trade deal could increase trade between South Korea and the United States, tallied at $90 billion last year, by as much as a quarter.
The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates that the deal will lift U.S. exports to South Korea as much by as $10.9 billion in its first year of full effect. The deal is the biggest U.S. trade pact since the North America Free Trade Agreement, which went into force in 1994.
The trade accord removes tariffs on almost two-thirds of U.S. farm exports and phases out duties on more than 95 percent of industrial goods within five years. It will help South Korea's economy expand by 5.7 percent within a decade, according to government estimates. Automobile, electronics and chemical exporters will benefit the most, while the farming sector is expected to suffer a big loss in production.
The opposition wants better protection for farmers and the country's nonmanufacturing industries. Kim Jin-pyo, floor leader of the Democratic Party, warned that the deal would ''deepen the polarization of wealth.''
Both governments signed the deal in 2007, but lawmakers' approval of it has been delayed by changes in governments in both countries and by U.S. demands that South Korea take steps to reduce an imbalance in auto trade. South Korea eventually compromised and addressed U.S. worries on cars through additional negotiations.
As Mr. Lee nears the last year of his five-year term, he faces declining popularity amid corruption scandals involving his former aides, concerns about deteriorating ties with North Korea and a widening wealth gap. But he is proud of the closer ties with the United States under his government -- a relationship he wanted to reaffirm by having Parliament pass the trade bill.
He likes to cite surveys showing that a majority of South Koreans support the deal. But last month, a vocal critic of his policies, including the trade agreement, won the election for Seoul mayor. Young voters were frustrated over the lack of employment opportunities, although the country's big businesses rake in huge profits through exports.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Head of F.C.C. Takes Step To Prevent AT&T Merger

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission took steps Tuesday to block the proposed $39 billion merger of the mobile phone companies AT&T and T-Mobile USA.
The chairman, Julius Genachowski, made the move after the commission's staff concluded that the deal would harm consumers, kill jobs and result in an overly concentrated wireless phone industry, F.C.C. officials said.
The decision puts another large roadblock in front of AT&T, the nation's second-largest wireless phone company, in its effort to buy T-Mobile, the fourth-largest carrier. In August, the Justice Department filed a federal antitrust lawsuit to block the merger, saying it would stifle competition.
Mr. Genachowski on Tuesday notified the other three F.C.C. commissioners that he intended to refer the proposed merger to an administrative law judge for a trial-like hearing in which AT&T would be required to show that the deal was ''in the public interest.'' The commission -- currently composed of three Democrats, including Mr. Genachowski, and one Republican -- is likely to vote on the chairman's plan in the next couple of weeks, an agency official said. 
The merger is subject to F.C.C. approval because the joining of the two companies will require transfer of licenses to use public airwaves for cellphone signals and wireless Internet access. The judge will weigh the evidence and render a decision, which then will be reviewed by the F.C.C. for a final judgment.
A hearing before the administrative judge would not happen until after the antitrust trial, scheduled for February in United States District Court in Washington, is completed.
Larry Solomon, senior vice president for corporate communications at AT&T, called the F.C.C.'s action ''disappointing.''
''It is yet another example of a government agency acting to prevent billions in new investment and the creation of many thousands of new jobs at a time when the U.S. economy desperately needs both,'' Mr. Solomon said in a statement. ''At this time, we are reviewing all options.''
Consumer groups and AT&T rivals, who have strongly opposed the merger, hailed Mr. Genachowski's move. ''As Chairman Genachowski said in August when the Justice Department filed its antitrust lawsuit against AT&T, the record before the F.C.C. presented 'serious concerns about the impact of the proposed transaction on competition,' '' said Vonya McCann, senior vice president for government affairs at Sprint, the third-largest carrier, which has filed its own lawsuit seeking to block the merger. (Verizon is the largest carrier.)
AT&T has sought to shift the focus of the public debate about the merger to jobs in recent months, casting the deal as crucial to meeting President Obama's goal of expanding high-speed Internet.
''This merger is going to be a driver of innovation, it's going to result in further investment in rural America and more jobs in rural America,'' Robert Quinn, AT&T's senior vice president for federal regulatory and chief privacy officer, said in an interview earlier this month.
But the company has been carefully circumspect about providing details about how its direct employment in the wireless business will be affected by the merger. Asked by the F.C.C. last month for specifics on how many workers the combined company would employ, the company said that many jobs would be eliminated and offered a confidential estimate of ''payroll and other job-related savings'' whose language strongly implied the number would go down instead of up. That has left F.C.C. officials unimpressed. ''The record clearly shows that, in no uncertain terms, this merger would result in a massive loss of U.S. jobs and investment,'' said a senior F.C.C. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements involving AT&T's estimates. The official declined to provide specific figures for jobs lost.
AT&T struck back at that statement, noting that the F.C.C. said its own plan for a $4.5 billion annual investment to expand broadband in rural areas would create 500,000 jobs in six years.
''This notion, that when government spends money on broadband it creates jobs, but when a private company spends money it doesn't, is clearly wrong on its face, and raises questions about the credibility of anyone at the F.C.C. who would make such a claim,'' said Jim Cicconi, AT&T's senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs.
An F.C.C. official said its estimates were based on building broadband where there was none, compared with AT&T's expansion of its network.
AT&T has said it plans to bring 5,000 call-center jobs back to the United States from abroad and has vowed that no United States call-center jobs will be eliminated after the merger. It also promised that any nonmanagement employees whose jobs were phased out because of the merger would be offered another position in the combined companies.
One group that says it believes AT&T's statements is the Communications Workers of America, the union that represents 160,000 AT&T employees, including 42,000 in its mobile unit.
This year, the union released a study that it commissioned by Ethan Pollack, a senior policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan organization in Washington whose board includes the president of the communications union.
AT&T has said it will invest $8 billion in wireless infrastructure over the first seven years of the newly merged company. That level of investment could create 55,000 to 96,000 jobs over the seven years, according to Mr. Pollack's analysis.
Only about 29 percent of those jobs would represent direct employment by the combined AT&T/T-Mobile, according to the analysis. The other jobs would be the trickle-down sort, which exist most often in economists' models -- like newly hired waitresses serving truck drivers delivering cellphone tower equipment..
Consumer groups and competitors argue that far more jobs would be eliminated by the merger. And, they add, the $8 billion in new AT&T capital expenditures is less than what AT&T and T-Mobile will spend separately.
Not so, says AT&T, which points to declines in T-Mobile's capital spending in recent years and the statements of T-Mobile's parent, Deutsche Telekom of Germany, that it is going to focus on its European business.
David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine and director of its Center for Economics and Public Policy, who was commissioned by Sprint to review the union's research, said that while the merger was likely to offer more and higher-paying jobs for C.W.A. members, over all ''it will almost surely act to directly reduce jobs for American workers.''

HEADLINE: Iran: Sanctions Likely to Grow

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Iran's economic isolation over suspicions that it may be working on a nuclear weapon deepened as the European Union agreed in principle to expand its sanctions, adding to measures announced by the United States, Britain and Canada. The added steps would bar Europeans from commercial transactions with 200 Iranian individuals, companies and groups, but would not stop European purchases of oil from Iran. Tehran, which has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, denounced the new sanctions.

HEADLINE: Financial Finger-Pointing Turns to Regulators

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and GRETCHEN MORGENSON; Isolde Raftery contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In the whodunit of the financial crisis, Wall Street executives have pointed the blame at all kinds of parties -- consumers who lied on their mortgage applications, investors who demanded access to risky mortgage bonds, and policy makers who kept interest rates low and failed to predict a housing market collapse.
But a new defense has been mounted by a bank executive: my regulator told me to do it.
This unusual rationale is presented by the bank executive in one of the few fraud suits brought against a mortgage banking official in the aftermath of the financial crisis -- the one filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Michael W. Perry, former chief executive of IndyMac Bancorp, which failed spectacularly in mid-2008. 
After being accused of fraud and misleading investors about his company's financial health just before it collapsed, Mr. Perry set up a Web site this fall to defend himself.
In a document on the site, he said that a top official at the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, IndyMac's overseer, directed and approved an action related to the S.E.C.'s allegations.
''It was O.T.S. who had the final say regarding IndyMac Bank's capital levels,'' Mr. Perry wrote.
He went on to say that Darrel W. Dochow, former regional director for the Western region of the agency and a financial regulator for more than 30 years, had ''specifically directed'' Mr. Perry to backdate IndyMac's report to regulators to include an $18 million cash infusion that would make it appear well capitalized.
The shift masked IndyMac's problems for any investors trying to assess its soundness and allowed it to continue attracting large deposits crucial to its operations.
The S.E.C., in its suit against Mr. Perry, contends that more details about the cash infusion should have been disclosed, though the commission did not accuse him of accounting fraud.
Mr. Dochow was not accused of wrongdoing by the commission or any other prosecutor, though his role has been criticized by the inspector general of the Treasury Department, which oversees some bank regulators. It does not appear that Mr. Perry's argument persuaded the commission to back off. The S.E.C., as is its custom, did not elaborate.
A representative for Mr. Perry said he did not care to discuss the case further, but his lawyer described the lawsuit in an e-mail as ''exceedingly weak, unfair and meritless.'' Mr. Dochow, who retired as a regulator in 2009 at age 59, said: ''There's a lot more than what's been written, but I can't talk. I could go to jail.''
The IndyMac collapse, with its multibillion-dollar cost to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fund, highlights the role played by federal overseers of financial companies in the years leading up to the crisis. It also raises questions about whether government officials should be held accountable for dubious conduct related to the failure of an institution and whether the government has avoided pursuing some cases because of the roles regulators have played. For years, some bank overseers have maintained cozy ties with the institutions they monitor, treating bankers like clients because of the fees that banks pay to be regulated.
The Justice Department could not cite any regulator that it had named in a prosecution related to the crisis. However, Mr. Dochow's conduct was referred to Justice for possible criminal charges in 2009, according to Eric Thorson, the inspector general of the Treasury Department. Mr. Thorson said Mr. Dochow's action ''was clearly improper and wrong.'' A spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Washington declined to comment on the case and on whether the department investigated regulators for possible wrongdoing.
IndyMac is not the only institution whose questionable accounting was approved by regulators in recent years, though it is by far the largest of several highlighted by the Treasury inspector general.
Even if regulators are involved in wrongdoing, they have some immunity. Internal disciplinary measures are rarely taken against regulators who perform badly in their jobs, say government officials.
Some regulatory shortcomings may be chalked up to innocent mistakes and failures to spot problems. Still, some economists and lawyers would like the government to examine regulatory actions leading up to the financial crisis to determine whether officials actively participated in improper behavior. And, they say, in cases like Mr. Dochow's, penalties should be levied on overseers who acted improperly.
''The word conspired needs to be used here,'' said Edward J. Kane, a finance professor and regulatory expert at Boston College who is familiar with the case. ''Dochow conspired with IndyMac management to misrepresent this. He was trying to fool certainly the F.D.I.C. and the public, and anyone who lost a dollar as a creditor to this institution was harmed by relying on something they had every right to rely on.''
Longtime defense lawyers say one reason there have been so few prosecutions related to the credit crisis is because financial executives often solicited advice from outside parties -- like accountants and lawyers -- and experts shelter them from some potential charges because they can argue they relied on the advice. Regulatory advice may be a similar shelter against prosecution.
A Comeback From Demotion
Mr. Dochow had had a long run as a financial regulator when IndyMac ran into trouble. He started out in 1972 as an assistant national bank examiner with the Comptroller of the Currency. He rose through the ranks and in 1985, became a senior regulator with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle and later with the Federal Home Loan Bank System's Office of Regulatory Activities in Washington.
It was during his time in that office that Mr. Dochow played a central role in trying to stop a regulatory attempt to rein in Lincoln Savings and Loan, an Arizona institution run by Charles Keating, with $5.5 billion in assets. After regulators in San Francisco uncovered fraudulent sales and other improprieties at the institution, Mr. Dochow worked in Washington to avoid the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, the normal course of action in such a case, according to records handed over to Congress. The savings and loan institution failed in 1989 at significant cost to taxpayers, and Mr. Keating was convicted on multiple fraud charges, some later overturned. Mr. Dochow was demoted, according to a half dozen regulators who had worked with him, but remained a bank regulator.
Once again, he worked his way up in the organization, which became the Office of Thrift Supervision. By September 2007, he had been promoted to head the Western region, reporting directly to the agency's top officials in Washington.
In that position, Mr. Dochow oversaw a host of institutions that had dived headlong into risky mortgage lending. Among them were Countrywide Bank, IndyMac Bancorp and Washington Mutual, three of the most aggressive lenders -- and largest flameouts -- in the crisis.
Mr. Dochow was known within the O.T.S. to be bank-friendly. One former examiner said: ''His approach was negotiating with the banks, as opposed to regulating the banks, and viewing them more as clients, as opposed to people or entities that needed to comply.''
According to three former examiners who worked with Mr. Dochow but who requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from regulatory colleagues, he would sometimes negotiate between the banks and their lower-level O.T.S. overseers, arguing that an institution should be allowed to keep one component of its regulatory rating high if another was dropping. That way, the composite score representing a bank's financial standing, would change little, if at all.
At other times, Mr. Dochow exhibited a close relationship with a savings and loan association when it was under investigation. In 2007, when the attorney general of New York was investigating Washington Mutual for its possible role in appraisal fraud, Mr. Dochow called Kerry K. Killinger, the institution's chief executive, to discuss the matter, according to e-mail messages released by a Senate subcommittee in the spring of 2010. Washington Mutual had hired a law firm to do an internal investigation. Mr. Dochow told Mr. Killinger that he wanted to rely on Washington Mutual's investigation as much as possible as opposed to having O.T.S. officials do a completely separate one.
Mr. Dochow told his superiors that he planned to leverage the Washington Mutual report but noted that ''we need to be able to defend that we have done our own independent examination.''
Mr. Dochow retired in 2009, with his full government pension, according to the Treasury inspector general. Because of its woeful regulatory record during the recent mania, O.T.S. was abolished last summer. Of its remaining employees, 95 were transferred to the F.D.I.C., and 670 to the Comptroller's office.
IndyMac's Survival Struggle
The S.E.C. case against Mr. Perry, IndyMac's longtime chief executive, and two former chief financial officer centers on disclosures made from February through mid-May of 2008. The disclosures related mostly to IndyMac's capital and liquidity. The bank collapsed in July of that year and was taken over by the F.D.I.C., which had to pay insured depositors $10.7 billion.
By early May, it had become clear inside IndyMac that it could no longer be considered ''well capitalized'' unless money was shifted from its holding company.
This meant that IndyMac could not accept so-called brokered deposits, large amounts of money from investors looking for the highest possible rates of return. Brokered deposits represented just over a third of IndyMac's deposits; without them, it would have been out of business.
And so on May 9, Mr. Perry instructed his deputies to shift money into the bank from the holding company and account for $18 million of it as if it had been there on March 31.
Mr. Dochow as well as IndyMac's auditors, Ernst & Young, had signed off on the move, according to the Treasury inspector general. And Mr. Perry highlighted the regulatory approval in a document on his Web site.
''Mr. Dochow, with full knowledge of the circumstances, communicated O.T.S.'s approval,'' Mr. Perry wrote. ''Mr. Dochow also directed Mr. Perry to amend the bank's thrift financial report to reflect the $18 million receivable.''
D. Jean Veta, a partner at Covington & Burling who represents Mr. Perry, said in an e-mail message that IndyMac's financial statements followed accounting rules and that Mr. Perry ''was a completely transparent leader who always favored more disclosure rather than less.'' But the O.T.S., the Comptroller's office and the inspector general's office at the Treasury Department have all said the backdating of the cash infusion was improper.
Mr. Thorson, the Treasury inspector general, said last week that Mr. Perry and Ernst & Young could reasonably say that they acted with permission of the O.T.S. ''I'm sure they said 'O.K., that's the guy who calls the shots; the umpire has called the shots,' '' Mr. Thorson said.
Indeed, when asked about the IndyMac accounting, a spokesman for Ernst & Young said last week that it was ''approved by the bank's regulator, not Ernst & Young.'' And there has been no enforcement action against the accounting firm.
Mr. Thorson said that his referral for a case against Mr. Dochow was given to Ranee Katzenstein, an assistant United States attorney in Los Angeles, and that Ms. Katzenstein told his office she did not intend to pursue a prosecution. When reached by phone, Ms. Katzenstein declined to say why. A spokesman for her office said she could not discuss the case. The spokesman said the investigation into Mr. Dochow's actions was still open, although he cautioned that it might not yield a case.
Another backdated capital shift with regulator approval took place in 2008 at a savings and loan association in Florida, according to Mr. Thorson's report. In August of that year, O.T.S. officials directed BankUnited to backdate capital that it had moved within its holding company. The report does not list their names, but it does include their titles, indicating that they were Timothy T. Ward, the deputy director for exams; Scott M. Polakoff, the agency's senior deputy director; and Jack Ryan, the Southeast regional director.
In another instance in July 2008, O.T.S. officials objected to a backdated capital shift at Century Bank, also of Florida, but did not require corrective action.
Mr. Polakoff was placed on leave in March 2009 pending a review of the capital backdating by the Treasury department. He now works as executive managing director at FinPro Inc., a financial services consulting firm in Liberty Corner, N.J. Mr. Polakoff defended his actions last week, saying that with BankUnited, it was a ''rather innocuous accounting mistake.''
Mr. Ward is a senior official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; through a spokesman, he declined to comment.
Mr. Ryan, who retired in 2009, said on Tuesday that he had pointed out at the time that the capital shift violated accounting rules, though he says he now regrets that he did not fight forcefully for his position.
''I think the regulators have to abide by the rules,'' he said. ''And, yeah, if they tell them, 'forget the rule, go ahead and do it' -- they shouldn't be doing that.''
Mr. Dochow, interviewed only briefly in front of his home outside Seattle, said he could not talk, but added that ''I'm not sure there's more to say.''
Regulators like Mr. Dochow, of course, would have the chance to publicly defend themselves if accusations against them ever resulted in court cases.
Regulators' Protection
It would be difficult and unusual for the Justice Department or the S.E.C. to bring a case against a bank regulator, longtime securities lawyers say. Regulators enjoy some immunity from allegations of wrongdoing under the Securities Exchange Act, which says that you cannot file a case against an officer of a United States agency for violation of a securities law if the officer was acting within the scope of the job. For financial regulators like Mr. Dochow, a conflict comes into play when banks run into trouble -- on one hand, regulators try to help banks maintain their stability. But, on the other hand, securities laws require companies to be transparent in their disclosures to public investors.
Jeffrey M. Kaplan, a lawyer at Kaplan & Walker in Princeton, N.J., said: ''In a case of a regulator contributing to misrepresentations made to shareholders, you could have individual criminal liability. But those cases are pretty rare.'' More common are cases involving a bribe or another element of corruption.
Congressional oversight could help identify regulatory misconduct, but such efforts have been less than fruitful. Indeed, when Senate investigators tried to get information about the capital backdating that O.T.S. had allowed at IndyMac and other institutions, officials from the agency were not forthcoming, said a former Senate aide who was not allowed to speak publicly about the investigation.
Any financial crisis case that named a regulator probably would turn into a huge political battle, because it would question many of the nontransparent acts that bank regulators take while trying to save banks, said Denise Voigt Crawford, former commissioner of the Texas securities board and now a law professor at Texas Tech University.
In any prosecution of bank regulators, she said, ''you'd have the Justice Department in a fight with the policy goals of the Department of Treasury. Particularly in this environment, you know the banking regulators would fight it tooth and nail.''
Some longtime lawyers go further and say the overall scarcity of cases related to the financial crisis might be in part because regulators want to avoid scrutiny of their own kind.
''It's not just one 30-year-old wunderkind who was responsible for the financial crisis,'' said Dennis C. Vacco, who was the New York State attorney general in the 1990s and now is a lawyer at Lippes Mathias Wexler & Friedman. ''Once you start pulling the string through in these complex cases, you might be surprised what you find at the other end.''
Mr. Vacco continued: ''What's at the end of the string? The defense may be that 'at the highest echelons of the financial institutions, we were in regular contact with the government.' ''

HEADLINE: Euro Troubles and Report on Slowing U.S. Economy Drag Down Shares

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
Stock indexes fell on Tuesday after the government lowered its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter.
Stocks fell sharply in morning trading but rebounded after the International Monetary Fund said it would extend new short-term lines of credit to developed countries. 
Traders were also reacting to a Spanish debt auction that sharply raised the country's borrowing costs.
''It doesn't look like the euro zone problems are going away and now we've had confirmation that the U.S. economy is slowing,'' said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels. ''I think this makes for a very difficult market.''
The Commerce Department in Washington said Tuesday that the nation's gross domestic productgrew at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from the 2.5 percent it had said previously.
Then, at midday, the I.M.F. said it had introduced a six-month liquidity line, throwing help to countries at risk from the euro zone crisis, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reversed earlier losses.
The index ended the day down just 4.94 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,188.04; on Monday, it lost 1.86 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 53.59 points, or 0.46 percent, to 11,493.72. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.86 points, or 0.07 percent. to 2,521.28.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index closed off 1.09 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London declined 0.3 percent.
Unless the European Central Bank has a change of heart and begins a major round of quantitative easing, or buying government bonds in large quantities to increase the money supply, Mr. Gijsels said he saw little reason for optimism.
Euro zone bonds reflected continuing stress. Spain's 10-year bonds were at 6.55 percent, up 8 basis points, while Italy's 10-year bonds were up to 6.79 percent. French 10-year bonds were at 3.55 percent, up 10 basis points. Germany's 10-year notes were flat at 1.91 percent.
In the United States, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, to 100 23/32, and its yield fell to 1.92 percent from 1.97 percent late Monday. The new Spanish government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which takes office next month, found Tuesday that there would be no market honeymoon after Spain had to pay more to sell short-term debt.
Mr. Rajoy's Popular Party won a resounding 186 seats and a governing majority on Sunday in Spain's 350-seat lower house of Parliament. It promised to turn around an economy whose jobless rate is over 20 percent.
But the Spanish Treasury on Tuesday sold three-month bills priced to yield 5.11 percent -- more than double the 2.29 percent it paid to sell similar securities on Oct. 25. It also sold six-month debt at 5.23 percent, up from 3.30 percent in October.

HEADLINE: Post-Mortems on the Supercommittee

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Supercommittee Collapses'' (editorial, Nov. 22):
The lifeblood of our democracy is a willingness to compromise. This is true from elementary school to the halls of Congress.
The fact that the Congressional supercommittee failed to reach an agreement on tax increases and spending cuts sends all the wrong signals to Americans everywhere. Only in Washington can failure be spun into victory.
DENNY FREIDENRICH Laguna Beach, Calif., Nov. 22, 2011 
To the Editor:
Our representatives are elected not only to represent their constituents' will but also to govern -- to do the hard work of understanding the complexity of national governance and to exercise judgment on their constituents' behalf to get the nation's work done.
Grover Norquist and his ideologues are trying to usurp these sworn responsibilities from our elected (and paid) representatives and to substitute his simplistic, monolithic, no-tax-increases worldview.
We're not paying our representatives to abdicate their responsibility and judgment. If Mr. Norquist wants to govern the nation by these precepts, let him come out of the shadows, run for office and see how many votes he can get.
JAMES F. BLAIR Ossining, N.Y., Nov. 22, 2011
To the Editor:
I grow weary of hearing Republicans blame President Obama for the numerous failures of Congress. The conservatives claim that Mr. Obama cannot lead, even as they engage in political sabotage and subterfuge to undermine any compromise that might actually help the economy and reduce the deficit.
Members of Congress are supposed to be responsible adults; they should not require leadership from the White House to meet their political duties and honor their oaths of office.
BUCK RUTLEDGE Knoxville, Tenn., Nov. 22, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Lawmakers Trade Blame as Deficit Talks Crumble'' (front page, Nov. 21):
It is easy to blame Congress or the president for the failure of the deficit supercommittee; the real blame falls on us, the people.
Too often, we citizens view Washington as just another reality show, gasping at the latest scandal or shaking our heads at the interparty clashes. We fail to appreciate how the federal budget affects our daily lives, through services like health care, retirement security and general economic stability.
People who haven't contacted their elected representatives to express their concern have no room to complain. At least the Tea Party and the Occupy Wall Street movement are having their voices heard. Where is everyone else?
PATRICK BACHLER Wilmette, Ill., Nov. 21, 2011
To the Editor:
After the abject failure of the supercommittee, it is time for the president to abandon his policy of appeasing his adversaries for the sake of bipartisanship, and firmly take the helm of the nation. With Democrats in Congress, he should craft an omnibus bill to achieve the $4 trillion in deficit reduction that he knows America needs.
This bill should permanently extend present tax rates for all but the very wealthiest, and should mandate broad tax reform within the next year. It should specify those spending cuts already agreed to by both parties. It should further mandate entitlement reforms, similar to those specified by Simpson-Bowles, regardless of how unpalatable they are to the base.
And it should embody elements of the president's jobs program, like repairing infrastructure and putting teachers and police back to work.
Introduce this bill in both houses of Congress. Let Republicans vote it down if they dare.
HERBERT A. GOLDSTEIN Monroe Township, N.J., Nov. 21, 2011
The writer is a retired management consulting partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama Weighed Risks of Engagement, and Decided to Give Voters the Final Say'' (news article, Nov. 22):
President Obama's reckless procrastination strikes again. He was elected president with a strong mandate and majorities in both houses of Congress, but rather than lead the government, he committed first to making Republicans part of a bipartisan happy and courteous family and achieved predictable results.
When midterm elections proved a disaster, he stayed the course of pursuing conviviality rather than exercising leadership. Now he is deferring all decisions that might annoy Republicans to after the election, perhaps so the Republicans can make them without as much interference from the Democrats.
Four years without an engaged president will be too long an experiment.

HEADLINE: New Winds in Mideast Favor Hamas

BYLINE: By STEPHEN FARRELL; Fares Akram contributed reporting.

 BODY:
GAZA -- For years, the imposing black gate that sealed the border between Egypt and Gaza symbolized the pain and isolation that decades of conflict have wrought on this tiny coastal strip, especially under Hamas in recent years.
But recently, the gate has come to represent a new turn for the increasingly confident Hamas leadership. The twin arches of the border crossing have swung open twice in recent weeks for V.I.P. arrivals, first to receive hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails as one captive Israeli soldier moved in the other direction, and a second time for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood to visit Gaza for the first time in decades.
Both instances lifted the fortunes of the Islamists at a critical time ahead of negotiations scheduled to be held in Cairo this week with their main rival, President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, who leads the Fatah party.
Hamas's leader, Khalid Meshal, arrives at those talks with a sense of regional winds at his back. Dictators have fallen, replaced by protest movements and governments that include the Islamist movements those dictators suppressed. Hamas has lost no opportunity to highlight this development as it basks in the growing regional importance of its parent organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest and most powerful Islamist movement in the world. 
''This is a hot Arab winter that has not until now ripened into spring,'' a Hamas official, Dr. Mahmoud Zahar, proclaimed in Gaza last month as he claimed the Arab revolutions for Islamic revivalism. The campaigns to oust corrupted leaders have reached a ''critical stage,'' he said, before concluding, ''With God's help, next year we will see the flowering of Islam.''
Mr. Abbas, by contrast, arrives with mixed success for his plan to gain United Nations recognition of statehood for Palestine. He has gained huge domestic support -- polls are 80 percent in his favor -- but the bid has faltered and he has alienated a crucial ally in Washington.
Hamas, on the other hand, trumpets its success in trading one captive Israeli soldier, Sgt. First Class Gilad Shalit, for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, hoping that the Egyptian-brokered exchange will erase Palestinians' memories of the increased isolation and blockades that Gaza suffered during Sergeant Shalit's captivity.
Boaz Ganor, an Israeli security analyst and the founder of the International Policy Institute for Counterterrorism, believes that Hamas is now ''much stronger'' than it was before. The Shalit deal, he believes, was part of a ''very detailed, sophisticated plan'' by Hamas, which the United States and the European Union have labeled a terrorist organization, to break free from its Gaza enclave and secure greater legitimacy ''at least in the international arena, if not in the eyes of Israel,'' before Palestinian elections, scheduled for May.
''As long as they were holding an Israeli soldier against the Geneva Conventions and so forth, they would not be regarded as a legitimate candidate,'' he said.
Both Hamas and Fatah leaders say that the Cairo talks will focus on setting up a unity transitional government of technocrats to take Palestinians through to elections, already long overdue.
Nabil Shaath, a member of Fatah's Central Committee, said that the talks would focus on unity, nonviolence and finding a cabinet and a prime minister acceptable to both sides. He said there was now a ''much better opportunity'' for agreement. Hamas had enjoyed success with the prisoner swap, and Fatah gained domestic support for the statehood bid, he said, and ''success reduces the need for competition.''
The statehood effort would benefit from reconciliation, he said, because among the ''major critiques'' that Mr. Abbas faced at the United Nations was the Palestinian Authority's lack of control over Gaza.
Hamas's momentum is not just confined to Egypt, where relations between the ruling military council and the Muslim Brotherhood have soured in the uprisings of recent days, but where the Brotherhood remains a powerful force before -- and almost certainly after -- elections scheduled to begin on Monday.
There is also sign of a thaw between Hamas and Jordan, which recently dropped its objection to allowing Mr. Meshal to visit Amman, Jordan's capital, from his base in the Syrian capital, Damascus, and Jordan's prime minister, Awn Khasawneh, declared that Jordan's decision to shut down Hamas's headquarters in Amman in 1999 was a ''political and constitutional mistake.''
But Hamas does face difficulties. For one thing, the opening to Jordan remains fragile. The Jordanian leader, King Abdullah II, paid a visit to the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority this week, a high-profile confirmation that he still regards Mr. Abbas as the leading figure in Palestinian politics.
Critics of Hamas also point out that it is a Sunni Arab movement that has received financial and political support from Iran, which has a Shiite non-Arab government. Having its headquarters in Damascus also puts it in a delicate position. Both Syria and Hamas are backed by Iran, but President Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on dissent in Syria has killed at least 3,500 people, including many of Hamas's Muslim Brotherhood colleagues.
''I think Iran would be happy if Hamas supported Assad's regime, but I don't think Hamas can do this because they classify themselves as freedom fighters, so they cannot stand with Assad against freedom fighters,'' said Waleed al-Modallal, a political scientist from Gaza.
But Nathan Thrall, a Jerusalem-based Middle East analyst with the International Crisis Group, sees opportunity in the fact that both Palestinian parties are at odds with their backers.
''For years, Palestinian reconciliation has been encumbered by claims from Fatah that Hamas's leadership is subject to an 'Iranian veto' and from Hamas that Fatah's leadership is subject to an American one,'' Mr. Thrall said. ''In the last several months, both parties have suffered a serious deterioration in relations with their patrons. That gives some people hope that factionalism might now be overcome.''
On the streets of Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas's prisoner exchange and Mr. Abbas's statehood initiative were both widely popular moves, which both sides have sought to promote heavily. But it is not yet clear that either development will prompt people to change their allegiance.
In the Balata refugee camp, a Fatah stronghold in the West Bank, Muhammad Zubeidi, 23, conceded that the prisoner release was a coup for Hamas. ''The day of the release was the first time for years that I have seen Hamas flags in Balata camp,'' he said. ''It might affect the decision of the families who got their loved ones back, but I think people will vote Fatah.''

HEADLINE: Obama, in New Hampshire, Goes to Bat for a Tax Cut

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- President Obama plunged into the heart of Republican primary land on Tuesday to deliver a direct challenge to Congress to act quickly to extend and expand the payroll tax cut when lawmakers return next week from the Thanksgiving holidays.
Laying out his proposal in deliberately simple and stark terms, the president told an audience here that if Republicans in Congress vote no, middle-class families will have to pay an additional $1,000 in taxes next year when the temporary break ends. 
''Next week, they'll get a simple vote,'' Mr. Obama said. ''No, your taxes go up. Yes, you get a tax cut. Which way do you think Congress should vote?''
The crowd cheered ''yes,'' as Mr. Obama went on to urge them to call their Congressional representatives and urge them to support the extension and expansion of the tax cut, which Congressional Republicans have previously rejected when it was part of the president's overall jobs bill. Now Mr. Obama is parsing out parts of the bill that he thinks have better chances of passage.
''If your members of Congress aren't listening, you've got to send them a message,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Tell them, don't be a Grinch.''
White House officials derided suggestions that Mr. Obama's trip to New Hampshire -- where Republican presidential aspirants have been working overtime in advance of the state's primary in January -- had any political overtones.
''There are a lot of states that matter in the political process -- if he didn't travel to any of them, we would severely limit our ability to travel,'' said the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, in remarks to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Manchester. Mr. Obama, Mr. Carney maintained, would ''not be talking about the many different Republican candidates.''
But right after saying that, Mr. Carney took a swipe at Mitt Romney, who unveiled his first television commercial of the campaign on Tuesday in New Hampshire, in which he attacked Mr. Obama for his economic leadership.
The ad features Mr. Obama saying, ''If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose,'' an editing down of something he did say in 2008. What Mr. Obama actually said, but the Romney ad edited out, was: ''Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, 'If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.' ''
In an e-mail, the Romney campaign defended the quotation. ''The tables have turned,'' the e-mail said.
''Seriously?'' Mr. Carney said. He called it an ''ad in which they deliberately distort what the president said.''
While Mr. Obama is running unopposed in the Democratic primary in New Hampshire, this is a state that he won in 2008, and would dearly like to win again next year. His trip seemed especially timed to suck away some air from the Republican primary campaigning that has been going on here in advance of the January primary.
Indeed, Mr. Obama's trip had all of the trappings of a campaign stop. The president took the time to work a rope line of supporters after Air Force One landed in Manchester, then headed -- driving past campaign signs for Rick Perry and Rick Santorum -- to the archetypal stop at Julien's Corner Kitchen, a local eatery where he chatted over coffee with a local family.
Then it was off to his marquee event at Manchester High School Central, where he bounded onto the stage as the high school band played a rousing version of ''Hail to the Chief,'' albeit at a slightly slower tempo than usual.

HEADLINE: Go Big, Mr. Obama

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
President Obama has a clear choice on how to approach the 2012 election: He can spend all his energy defining Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich or whoever ends up as the Republican nominee in as ugly a way as possible, or he can spend all his energy defining the future in as credible a way as possible. If he spends his energy defining his Republican opponent, there is a chance the president will win with 50.00001 percent of the vote and no mandate to do what needs doing. If he spends his time defining the future in a credible way and offering a hard, tough, realistic pathway to get there, he will not only win, but he will have a mandate to take the country where we need to go. 
I voted for Barack Obama, and I don't want my money back. He's never gotten the credit he deserves for bringing the economy he inherited back from the brink of a depression. He's fought the war on terrorism in a smart and effective way. He's making health care possible for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions, and he saved the auto industry. This is big stuff. But, as important as all of these achievements are, they pale in comparison to the defining challenge of Obama's presidency: Can he put the country on a sustainable economic recovery path at a time when, if we fail, it could be the end of the American dream?
I believe the best way for Obama to do that is by declaring today that he made a mistake in spurning his own deficit reduction commission, chaired by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, and is now adopting Simpson-Bowles -- which already has Republican and Democratic support -- as his long-term fiscal plan to be phased in after a near-term stimulus. If he did that, he would win politically and create a national consensus that would trump his opponents, right and left.
''I think what happened with Simpson-Bowles was an absolute tragedy,'' Warren Buffett said on CNBC last week. ''They work like a devil for 10 months. ... They compromise. They bring in people as far apart as [Democratic Senator Dick] Durbin and [Republican Senator Tom] Coburn to get them to sign on and then they're totally ignored. I think that's a travesty.''
The president will never get the near-term stimulus through that he wants and that the economy needs without combining it with a credible bipartisan, multiyear deficit-reduction plan like Simpson-Bowles. Moreover, ''a free-standing stimulus that is not combined with a credible multiyear plan that truly stabilizes our fiscal imbalances would not solve our problems,'' argues Maya MacGuineas, the president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, ''because if nobody knows what is waiting around the corner, after the stimulus runs out,'' many people will just take that money and stuff it in a mattress ''rather than in investments or spending.''
Obama aides argue that so many G.O.P. lawmakers are committed to making his presidency fail, or have signed pledges to an antitax cult, that they would never buy into any grand bargain. I think that is true for a lot of Republicans in Congress. But I have some questions: Why are the Republicans getting away with this? Why are so many independents and even Democrats who voted for Obama sitting on their hands? Obama owns the bully pulpit of the presidency and he's losing to Grover Norquist? Also, assuming it is all true about the G.O.P., how can Obama trump them? I think he can, if he leads in a new way.
I think America's broad center understands very clearly that the country is in trouble and that the Republican Party has gone nuts. But when they look at Obama on the deficit, they feel something is missing. People know leadership when they see it -- when they see someone taking a political risk, not just talking about doing so, not just saying, ''I'll jump if the other guy jumps.'' In times of crisis, leaders jump first, lay out what truly needs to be done to fix the problem, not just to win re-election, and by doing so earn the right to demand that others do the same.
What would it look like if the president was offering such leadership? First, he'd be proposing a deficit-cutting plan that matches the scale of our problem -- one with substantial tax reform and revenue increases, a gasoline tax, deep defense cuts and cutbacks to both Social Security and Medicare. That is the Simpson-Bowles plan, and it should be Obama's new starting point for negotiations. The deficit plan Obama put out last September is nowhere near as serious. ''It is watered-down Simpson-Bowles,'' said MacGuineas. ''Most people don't even know it exists.''
Second, he'd offer a plan in which the wealthy have to pay their fair share and more, because they've had a great two decades. But everyone, including the middle class, has to contribute something. This has to be a national effort. Third, he would offer a plan that is aspirational. It would not just be a roadmap to balancing the budget but to making America great again through reignited economic growth.
My gut says that if the president lays out such a plan -- one that begins with him taking all the political risks on himself and then demanding the G.O.P. and his own party follow -- he will be both defining himself and the future in a way that would earn him so much centrist support and respect that it would leave every possible Republican opponent in the dust, no matter how obstructionist they are or want to be.
Go big, Mr. President. You will win, and so will America.

HEADLINE: America's Cold War Sage and His Discontents

BYLINE: By FRED KAPLAN. 
Fred Kaplan is the national security columnist for Slate and a Schwartz Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation.

 BODY:
GEORGE F. KENNAN
An American Life
By John Lewis Gaddis
Illustrated. 784 pages. The Penguin Press. $39.95.
This may be the most long-awaited single-volume biography ever. In 1981, the renowned cold war historian John Lewis Gaddis approached the pre-eminent cold war diplomat George F. Kennan about writing his life story. Kennan, who was 78 at the time, turned over mountains of papers, diaries, letters, even dream notebooks, on the condition that the book not be published until after he died. Who knew that he'd live to be 101, or that Mr. Gaddis would take more than a half-decade after his subject's death to finish writing?
Just as well. For ''George F. Kennan: An American Life'' turns out to be not only an epic work --probing, engrossing, occasionally revelatory -- but also a well-timed one. It appears just as its subject has been nearly forgotten and long enough after the 20th century has passed to appreciate his towering significance. 
The book may not match the sweeping elegance of Edmund Morris's series on Theodore Roosevelt or Robert Caro's on Lyndon Johnson (or, for that matter, Kennan's own 1967 memoir). But Mr. Gaddis is a fine enough writer; the story flows breezily; and several scenes are vivid, even gripping -- most notably the accounts of Kennan's private meetings with Franklin Roosevelt and, much later, his embrace from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when both Kennan and the cold war, which he had spent much of his life managing, were in their twilights.
Kennan made his deepest mark as the author of the containment doctrine, which governed American foreign policy for a half-century, arguably prevented World War III and both predicted, and set the stage for, the crumbling of the Soviet empire. He first outlined the idea in a 5,000-word top-secret missive, the so-called Long Telegram, written in 1946 while he was deputy head of the United States mission in Moscow, then in a 1947 article in Foreign Affairs under the byline ''X,'' a pseudonym that was pierced within days.
At the time no one had devised a framework for how to view the postwar world, with its two emerging superpowers and a devastated Europe in between them. The common assumption was that if Soviet and American diplomats failed to agree on a mutually acceptable plan for peace, war was inevitable.
Kennan's insight was twofold. First, he argued, the notion of such a plan was a pipe dream, as the Kremlin's masters, by their ideology and their history, viewed the capitalist United States and the Communist Soviet Union as inherently antagonistic. But, second, he offered the assurance that America could peacefully finesse this confrontation through ''a policy of firm containment'' to check the Soviets' expansionist tendencies.
The West had only to be patient (for the Soviets had no timetable); economically strong (for Communism thrives on ''diseased tissue''); and true to its principles (for, at some point, the Eastern European satellites would break free from Soviet domination, and they would need an alternative vision to inspire them).
Ever since, in times of crisis or transition, diplomats have dreamed of their own ''Kennan moment,'' in which they unravel the era's mysteries and plot a course of triumph. Alas, Mr. Gaddis's masterly telling of how, in this sense, Kennan became Kennan suggests that we may have seen the last of his kind.
Kennan's training in grand strategy was self-administered and largely a fluke. During World War II he made seven trans-Atlantic trips on diplomatic duty. The voyages took weeks; with nothing else to do, he read literature and histories, especially Gibbon's chronicle of the decline of the Roman empire, which inspired his thinking about how the Soviet empire might rise and fall.
He also wrote voluminous letters to his sister, Jeanette, rehearsing many of the ideas he'd refine later. The seeds of his Long Telegram, for instance, were first planted in such a letter three years earlier.
It's hard to imagine any official today finding the time for this level of reflection. It's also hard to imagine someone of Kennan's temperament holding senior posts in the Foreign Service.
He was always ''an outsider in his own time,'' Mr. Gaddis writes, perpetually gloomy, frustrated and self-absorbed, perhaps the result of his mother's having died during his birth and a beloved cousin's leaving when he was a toddler; she had served as a second mother. (Mr. Gaddis isn't reductive on the point, but notes that Kennan himself, fascinated with Freud, saw the losses as a central influence in his life.)
Vital as he was in molding postwar American policy, Kennan knew little and cared even less about American politics or culture. ''I hate democracy ... I hate the 'peepul,' '' reads one of the milder entries on the topic in his diaries, from which Mr. Gaddis quotes at entertaining length.
After the war, Secretary of State George C. Marshall made Kennan director of his newly created Policy Planning Staff (the highest Washington job he would ever attain). In the two and a half years he ran it, the staff produced over 70 formal papers, totaling more than 900 single-spaced pages. Yet it functioned, as Mr. Gaddis writes, ''on the premise that a single policy planner (Kennan) could suggest to a single policy maker (Marshall) what he, and hence the nation, ought to do.'' It was, ''in this sense, strikingly solipsistic.''
Kennan soon clashed with Marshall's successor, Dean Acheson, and his own deputy, Paul H. Nitze, mainly over their inclination to include a military buildup as a major ingredient of containment. But Acheson didn't force him out, as both men's memoirs report. Rather, Kennan resigned, as he'd threatened to do repeatedly since joining the Foreign Service in 1925, because he couldn't stand not getting his way completely.
Mr. Gaddis considers his subject ''a great man,'' but finds it exasperating that Kennan, in letters and diaries, despaired over his ''intellectual isolation,'' even while his presumed tormentors continued to call on him during crises and often took his advice, as Acheson did in ending the Korean War at the 38th Parallel, and as President Eisenhower did on overall cold war policy (overruling his own secretary of state, John Foster Dulles).
Repeatedly Kennan would retreat to the groves of academe to escape the ulcer-inducing agonies of rejection; yet he would wait by the phone or shamelessly call to offer his services whenever a new president entered office.
In his final years he won acclaim from the sorts of protesters he once despised for railing, sensibly, against nuclear overkill. And he maintained that the Kremlin's adventurism in the 1970s reflected insecurity and impending decline, a view validated when the Soviet archives were opened a decade later.
Yet his judgments were inconsistent over time. When the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, he proposed sending 100,000 more American troops to West Germany. So much for his bedrock principle of letting superpowers do as they pleased within their ''spheres of influence.''
More troubling to Mr. Gaddis was that Kennan missed the early but clear signs of the Soviet Union's unraveling -- and thus his own vindication -- because he couldn't bear to see it happening under Ronald Reagan, who, in his folksy populism and Hollywood background, embodied so much of what Kennan despised about America.
Kennan died in 2005, ''prophetic but no longer relevant,'' as perhaps prophets by nature must be.

HEADLINE: Democrats Crying Foul Over a New Romney Ad

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Democrats reacted ferociously on Tuesday to Mitt Romney's first campaign commercial, which they said distorted comments by Barack Obama to make it look as if he was running away from his record on the economy.
But a Democratic reaction may have been just what Mr. Romney wanted. The ad was timed to confront President Obama on his visit to New Hampshire. And coming on the day of another primary debate, it let Republican voters know that Mr. Romney would take a combative posture toward Mr. Obama if he became their presidential nominee. 
In the ad, Mr. Obama is heard declaring, ''If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.''
Left out was the context for Mr. Obama's comment, which he made during the 2008 presidential election -- he was talking about his opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona. What Mr. Obama said was, ''Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, 'If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.' ''
Mr. Obama's allies assailed the ad, accusing Mr. Romney of being ''deceitful'' and ''dishonest.'' Brad Woodhouse, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, called Mr. Romney a ''serial deceiver'' and said ''his deceptions know no bounds.''
Mr. Romney's top advisers were unrepentant, calling the response ''hysterical'' and accusing Mr. Obama's campaign of routinely lying about Mr. Obama's record.
''This is what happens to people who forget that there is a process by which they will be challenged, and they will be held accountable,'' said Stuart Stevens, a top adviser to Mr. Romney. ''They don't get to choose what this race is about. It's going to be Candidate Obama running against President Obama.''
Aides to Mr. Romney refused to give any ground on their use of the Obama statement, saying Mr. Obama's campaign had first misrepresented the quote by saying it was an official position of Mr. McCain's campaign. In fact, they note, the quote was from an unnamed ''McCain strategist'' and not an official statement from his campaign.
''They knew absolutely well that wasn't a position of the McCain campaign, and they went out and said it with that mocking tone, day after day after day,'' Mr. Stevens said. ''We believe if he keeps talking about the economy, they will lose. They are welcome to prove us wrong.''
The result of the back and forth was to highlight an ad that Mr. Romney's campaign spent relatively little to broadcast -- just $134,000 on one New Hampshire television station. By generating controversy, Mr. Romney's campaign managed to get a much wider distribution for the ad.
Mr. Romney's campaign is also orchestrating a series of other events: rallies near the site of the president's visit, wall-to-wall radio and television interviews by allies of Mr. Romney, and an open letter to Mr. Obama in the state's three largest newspapers.
In the letter, Mr. Romney, in a polite but firm tone, directly addressed Mr. Obama as the Republican nominee might eventually do next year. ''The evidence is in and it is unequivocal,'' he wrote. ''I will be blunt. Your policies have failed. It is bad enough that they have fallen short even by the standards your own administration set for itself. But things are much worse than that. Far from bringing the crisis to an end, your policies have actively hindered economic recovery.''
If there was any doubt that Mr. Romney's campaign is looking beyond the primary toward a fight against Mr. Obama, even his top advisers are barely concealing that fact now.
Gail Gitcho, Mr. Romney's communications director, said in an interview Monday night that the effort in New Hampshire was the campaign's ''most intense'' yet to confront the president when he travels around the country. ''Every day from now on, the American voters and the Romney campaign are going to hold the president responsible,'' she said.
In a nearly hourlong interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News on Monday night, Mr. Romney repeatedly attacked the president's record, even as he virtually ignored his Republican rivals. ''I want people to remember that when he was Candidate Obama, he said he was going to get this economy going,'' he said . ''The contrast between what he said and what he did is so stark.''
It is a message that Mr. Obama's advisers reject, and it was largely ignored when he arrived in the state on Tuesday. Mr. Obama lashed out at Republicans in Congress for blocking the tax cut.
''If your members of Congress aren't listening, you've got to send them a message,'' he said. ''Tell them, Don't be a Grinch.''
The contrast between the two men offers an early glimpse of the competing messages that each will probably offer if Republicans choose Mr. Romney as their standard-bearer.
That day is months away. But as the Romney campaign wrote in the subject line of an e-mail to reporters Monday: ''Game On.''

HEADLINE: Higher Prices Hurt Campbell Soup Sales

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Campbell Soup said on Tuesday that its first-quarter net income fell 5 percent as the company worked to turn around its soup business in the United States and expand internationally. 
Profit was better than expected, mainly as a result of lower spending on advertising and fewer shares outstanding.
But revenue missed expectations as volume declined on higher prices.
The company, like other food makers, has raised prices to offset higher costs for ingredients and other materials.
''Consumers continued to be impacted by the challenges in the global economy'' during the quarter, Denise M. Morrison, its chief, said in a call with analysts. ''There's little doubt that the pronounced caution and restraint that have characterized consumer behavior since the onset of the financial crisis are now the 'new norm' for the food and beverage sector.''
The company is trying to regain lost ground after several years of declining soup sales. Soup sales in the United States fell 4 percent during the quarter as higher prices hurt volume. Shoppers have curbed their soup consumption, stopped stocking pantries or shifted to competitors' brands.
Campbell is in the early stages of a turnaround plan that includes adding high-end soups and broadening offerings in its snack, beverage and other categories.
The company lowered prices on soup last year in promotions, causing tough comparisons for this year. Campbell Soup also cut its advertising spending, shifting ad dollars to later in the quarter to more closely correspond with soup season.
Despite higher prices, Ms. Morrison said the sales decline was not as pronounced as expected, helping profitability. She said that Campbell was aiming to stabilize the soup division's profitability and would then try to drive revenue growth.
Some bright spots were the company's Goldfish crackers, Pepperidge Farm's Milano Melts and new Cracker Chips. Sales in the global baking and snacking unit rose 4 percent, to $568 million.
Over all, net income fell to $265 million, or 82 cents a share, in the quarter ended Oct. 30, from net income of $279 million, or 82 cents a share, in the same period last year. Analysts polled by FactSet expected 79 cents a share.
Shares fell on Tuesday $1.77, or more than 5 percent, to $31.84.

HEADLINE: Commercial Colleges Took Bogus High School Credentials, a U.S. Inquiry Finds

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Most of the commercial colleges tested by undercover investigators posing as students allowed them to enroll with fake high school graduation credentials, according to a report released Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office, an auditing arm of Congress.
And most of the colleges that enrolled investigators violated academic policies on cheating or grading, or the federal regulations requiring exit counseling for those with student loans, the report said.
Between October 2010 and last month, the investigators posed as students and tried to enroll in introductory online courses at 15 commercial colleges, 12 of which allowed them to use a fictitious home-school diploma or a diploma from a high school that had closed. 
The students then tested the colleges' academic practices by ignoring assignments; turning in incorrect, unresponsive or plagiarized homework; or failing to log in to class.
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, requested the undercover report as part of his continuing investigation into the practices of the rapidly expanding commercial sector.
''The fact that many of the schools accepted incomplete and plagiarized work -- sometimes for full credit -- leads me to question whether for-profit college students are truly receiving the quality education they are promised to prepare them for a good job,'' Mr. Harkin said in a statement.
''Coupled with sky-high tuition costs, alarming dropout rates, poor job placement services and the many other troubling practices that we've uncovered in the HELP Committee's investigation,'' he said, ''it is obvious that Congress must step in to hold this heavily federally subsidized industry more accountable.''
Brian Moran, interim president of the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, said the report should not be seen as an indictment of all career colleges.
''The G.A.O.'s report reflects only a tiny fraction of private sector schools,'' Mr. Moran said in a statement. ''The reality is that the overwhelming majority of schools in the private sector have proven invaluable in preparing nontraditional students facing unique challenges so they can compete for jobs in a challenging economy.''
He also questioned the report, ''given the one-sided nature of Senator Harkin's inquiry into the proprietary sector of higher education and serious flaws in the previous G.A.O. report regarding this sector.''
The report did not identify the colleges but said they included the five largest commercial colleges, and the one about which the Government Accountability Office had received the most unsolicited complaints.
At one college, a student enrolled in a ''Learning Strategies and Techniques'' course that was required as part of a two-year associate degree business program. The student submitted photos of political figures and celebrities in answers to essay questions and failed to participate in required real-time chat sessions, but passed the course anyway, the report found.
In the same course at another college, after a student failed two multiple-choice quizzes, the instructor reminded the student that quizzes could be retaken. Since the correct answers were displayed upon completion, the instructor added, ''it's not hard to get a 100 percent on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again.''
At another college, an instructor gave a student an A on an assignment the student had never submitted.
And at a third, a student consistently submitted material that was clearly plagiarized from online sources or the class textbook and received credit for the assignments, although the instructor noted the plagiarism and told the student to paraphrase.
Three of the colleges did not provide the required counseling on loan repayment and the consequences of default when students withdrew.
The report did find some instances of good practice, though. At one college, when the undercover student logged in but did not submit any assignments or participate in discussions, the instructor repeatedly tried to contact her to offer help. At another, a student who failed to maintain the required 65 percent average for the first five weeks was expelled, with no financial obligation, as college policy required.

HEADLINE: Obama Aide Says Iran's Leaders Are Feeling the Strain of Sanctions

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A day after the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, President Obama's national security adviser argued Tuesday that the administration's pressure campaign had left Iran's leaders economically strained, diplomatically isolated and rent by internal divisions.
The official, Thomas E. Donilon, predicted that the next blow to Iran would come with the fall of its major regional ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who is himself increasingly isolated as he battles a popular uprising. 
''Having actively funded the regime's brutality and the killing of its own people, Iran will be discredited in the eyes of the Syrian people and any future government,'' Mr. Donilon said in a closely monitored speech at the Brookings Institution. ''Iran's isolation from the Arab world will have deepened.''
Noting that President Assad had been scorned by the Arab League and abandoned by Turkey's leader, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr. Donilon said the Syrian leader's time was running out. He even referred to Mr. Assad's administration as the ''Assad group,'' which made it sound less like a government than a gang.
Since taking over as national security adviser 13 months ago, Mr. Donilon has emerged as one of the most influential foreign-policy voices in the administration. And with the departure next month of another senior adviser, Dennis B. Ross, Mr. Donilon is taking direct control of the delicate Iran portfolio.
Answering critics of the administration, he dismissed fears that the withdrawal of the last American troops from Iraq next month would open the door to rising Iranian influence. The Iraqi people, he said, hold deeply unfavorable impressions of Iran, even those who support political groups backed by Tehran.
''Iran has failed in its effort to shape Iraq into a client state in its own image,'' said Mr. Donilon, adding that the United States would maintain a ''long-term strategic partnership'' with Iraq after the troops leave.
Kenneth M. Pollack, director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings, said he did not dispute that characterization. But he added that if cornered, Iraq's Shiite population ''will inevitably fall back on the Iranians, not because they like them, but because they have no one else to turn to.''
On Monday, the United States and its allies announced coordinated sanctions that aimed to sever Iran's access to the international banking system, but that still fell short of a total cutoff. The United States imposed separate sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry, and further measures against its oil industry.
The steps showed both the progress of the administration's efforts to rally global support and the hurdles still ahead. Russia and China have refused to impose additional measures, leaving the effort less a worldwide campaign than a Western one.
''They've been very good partners, frankly,'' Mr. Donilon said, when asked about the lack of unity, but he did not elaborate.
He also did not say whether he believed that Iran could be prevented from making a nuclear weapon, a goal the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a recent report the Iranians could be actively pursuing.
Still, in making the case for Mr. Obama's strategy, Mr. Donilon said that sanctions had slowed down Iran's progress. Citing the atomic energy agency's report, he said Iran currently had about 6,000 working centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium to weapons grade, far fewer than the 50,000 centrifuges that the head of Iran's atomic energy organization predicted in 2007 that Tehran would have by 2011.
He cited the high cost and difficulty Iran had in obtaining equipment to run its uranium enrichment program, though he made no mention of covert efforts to sabotage the program, like the computer worm Stuxnet, a cyberattack that may have had the involvement of both the United States and Israel.
As for Iran's broader economy, Mr. Donilon said the sanctions had brought it to a virtual standstill, with an inflation rate of 20 percent, high unemployment and ''negligible growth,'' despite high oil prices. The growing economic sway of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a further cause of frustration, he said.
Mr. Donilon pointed to growing fissures within the Iranian leadership, noting that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ''seem increasingly headed toward a confrontation over the direction of the country.'' On Monday, a top adviser to Mr. Ahmadinejad was briefly arrested, in what appeared to be a sign of the mounting tensions.
Mr. Donilon made no mention of recent reports that Israel was considering a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities -- something that has privately concerned officials. But he repeated the administration's position that the United States would take no options off the table in dealing with Tehran.
''Pressure is a means not an end, and our policy is firm,'' he said. ''We are determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.''

HEADLINE: The Ad Campaign: A Misleading Quotation

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign began broadcasting its first television ad in New Hampshire on Tuesday - the same day that President Obama visited the state to talk about his plan to turn around the economy. THE SCRIPT The words, ''On October 16, 2008 Barack Obama Visited New Hampshire,'' flash across the screen before spliced video of Mr. Obama's campaign in 2008 begins: ''Thank you. Thank you New Hampshire. How is everybody doing today? I am confident that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. Who's been in charge of the economy? We need a rescue plan for the middle class. We need to provide relief for homeowners. It's going take a new direction. If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.'' 
As Mr. Obama speaks, the words, ''He failed,'' flash across the screen, before the ad switches to Mr. Romney, who says: ''I'm going to do something to government. I call it the smaller, simpler, smarter approach to government. Getting rid of programs, turning programs back to states and, finally, making government itself more efficient. I'm going to get rid of ObamaCare. It's killing jobs. And it's keeping our kids from having the bright prospects they deserve. We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in. I'll make sure that America is a job-creating machine like it has been in the past. It's high time to bring those principles of fiscal responsibility to Washington, D.C. I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message.''
ON THE SCREEN The ad starts with grainy, faded pictures Mr. Obama on the campaign trail in 2008, interspersed with images of empty storefronts and for sale homes with foreclosure signs hanging out front. When the ad switches over to Mr. Romney, the images become bright and pristine, and feature the former Massachusetts governor - always in a button-down work shirt - talking to small groups of workers and addressing town halls. ACCURACY The ad's most devastating line - Mr. Obama saying, ''If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose'' - is also its most misleading, and has already come under attack from Democrats and Mr. Obama's re-election campaign for being ''deceitful and dishonest.'' In fact, Mr. Obama uttered the line in 2008, when he was referring to something that an aide to his then opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona, had said in reference to the McCain campaign - not Mr. Obama, then or now. Mr. Obama's full quote, which the Romney campaign edited down, was: ''Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.''
In an e-mail release, the Romney campaign defended its use of the truncated quote, explaining that, ''the tables have turned,'' and the line Mr. Obama once used against Mr. McCain could now be leveled against Mr. Obama.
One other problem with the 60-second spot is the implication that Mr. Obama is trying to avoid talking about the economy. Out of necessity, Mr. Obama frequently addresses the economy; the ad was pegged to first be broadcast on the day Mr. Obama heads to New Hampshire - where, in fact, he will be talking about the economy.
SCORE CARD Mr. Romney has cast himself as a turnaround expert with 25 years in the private sector, and it makes sense for him to hit Mr. Obama on the economy, presenting himself as a viable alternative. However, the out-of-context line, while earning Mr. Romney lots of free media, could also backfire with voters who dislike negative and misleading ads.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Millions Caught by the Social Safety Net

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Does the social safety net protect people from poverty or rob them of incentives to earn? 

 BODY:
 
Despite the severe recession, relatively few people saw their living standards fall into poverty, thanks to the social safety net.
According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the percentage of the United States population living in poverty increased by 0.6, to 15.5 in 2010 from 14.9 in 2007. 
The poverty measure refers to resources available to families, accounting for the taxes they pay and subsidies they receive. Considering all that happened in the economy over those three years, 0.6 percentage points is quite a small change. Measures of the poverty rate typically change more than that over any three-year interval.
The study found that many people were technically above the poverty line in 2010, although their incomes were low, because they received government assistance like unemployment insurance, food stamps and refundable tax credits. The government assistance permitted them to have living standards above poverty, even while their market incomes were below the poverty line.
Were it not for government assistance, the study found, the recession would have pushed 4.2 percent of the population into poverty, rather than 0.6 percent.

One interpretation of these results is that the safety net did a great job: For every seven people who would have fallen into poverty, the social safety net caught six. Perhaps if the 2009 stimulus law had been a little bigger or a little more oriented to safety-net programs, all seven would have been caught.
Another interpretation is that the safety net has taken away incentives and serves as a penalty for earning incomes above the poverty line. For every seven persons who let their market income fall below the poverty line, only one of them will have to bear the consequence of a poverty living standard. The other six will have a living standard above poverty.
The safety net was not as effective before the recession began. As I explained in my last twoposts, government assistance programs have not only supported more people but become more generous, thanks to changes in benefit rules since 2007.
Of course, most people work hard despite a generous safety net, and 140 million people are still working today. But in a labor force as big as ours, it takes only a small fraction of people who react to a generous safety net by working less to create millions of unemployed. I suspect that employment cannot return to pre-recession levels until safety-net generosity does, too.

HIGHLIGHT: How dare he look at actual data? 

 BODY:
Here:
I've been saying the following to friends and colleagues for months now: In all my many years as a business and economics reporter, I have never seen a greater cognitive dissonance than in the current coverage of the U.S. bond market. Even Chicken Little and the Boy Who Cried Wolf would have by now taken early retirement had their warnings proved as lame as those of the MSEM (mainstream economic media).
"S&P Downgrades!" "Bond Vigilantes Poised to Strike!" "America is Greece!" One-liners meant to catch the eye, freeze the heart. But flat-out irresponsible.
...
And, checking with NYU's celebrated economic historian Richard Sylla, we find that today's rates are astonishingly close to the lowest in the entire history of the United States: 1.85 percent, the nadir reached in late 1941. That was the record, I should say -- until September 22, when the 10-year U.S. interest rate plunged briefly to 1.695 percent.
So what's going on? Well, rather obviously, investors are a lot more worried about the credit of Greece -- or Spain or Italy -- than ours. Investors are also more worried about stock investments. Investors are also more worried about almost any other asset into which they might put their money.
Investors also seem pretty sure that U.S. inflation is not going to be a problem anytime soon. If inflation scared them, they'd hardly let the United States lock in an interest rate of less than 2 percent for an entire decade.
So then why isn't it plausible to draw the following conclusion: that U.S. interest rates have been going in the "wrong" direction because investors are scared that the U.S. is going to reduce its debt and deficits, and such a reduction might horse-collar the world economy? 
Solman better watch it. He's in danger of not being considered Serious, which is what happens when you let facts get in the way of your orthodox narrative.

HEADLINE: More Than a Road Trip

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: You might be tempted to call it a photographic road trip, but it's more than that. On their cross-American adventure, James Estrin writes, Luceo has become something of a "photographic rapid response team." Off they go. 

 BODY:
While other photo collectives have done fine group work, Luceo's project on rural America, "Few And Far Between," stands out.
For starters, none of the evocative images from their recent work have an individual photographer's byline. All are credited to Luceo.
Also, the group's members traveled together. In a rented RV.
David Walter Banks, Kendrick Brinson, Matt Eich, Daryl Peveto and Matt Slaby journeyed through Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and Nevada in late August, stopping for two to three days in a town to photograph different stories.
I'd call it a photographic road trip, but Mr. Banks doesn't like to use the term "road trip" because it doesn't convey the scope - or seriousness - of their approach to documenting rural America.
Fair enough. Their photographs back that up.
Whatever you call it, the endeavor is classic Luceo - traveling together, working as a team, having a good time and sharing their experiences using blog posts and Twitter.
"What we can produce as a unit working together is more than the sum of our parts," Mr. Banks said.
Mr. Banks, Ms. Brinson and Mr. Slaby started "Few and Far Between" in 2010 during a trip to Lebanon, Kan. The project has since grown to include eight different states. (Kevin German missed this trip because he was finishing his own motorcycle trip through Vietnam.)
The photographers described their project as the first in a series that will examine the changes sweeping over rural America, challenging the simple stereotypes of shrinking populations. If anything, they have seen slow growth, fueled by a shifting, globalized economy.
"This change in industry, however, does not represent an overall repurposing of rural communities," they wrote on their Web site. "Instead, there has been a slow population decline in farming-based counties throughout the middle states of America offset by significant growth in Western states that boast alternative economies."
The trip was funded by Luceo's Project Fund, where a portion of every member's assignment fee - editorial or commercial - finances individual or group projects.
They are trying to raise more money for future installments of the project and are selling a quirky, one-of-a-kind handmade book that includes original instant photos and artifacts gathered on this trip. Each member collected artifacts and documented their experiences using various instant cameras. The images and artifacts have been gathered and assembled by Mr. Peveto into a one-of-a-kind book.
After seeing these photos, I'm looking forward to the results of future trips and the monographs they plan to sell in their online store. But I'm still left wondering what to call this adventure.
How about a photographic rapid response team?
"There's an image loose in the southwest corner of Idaho!" And off they go.

HEADLINE: Fatalism and the American Dream

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Compared to other Westerners, Americans are most likely to say they have control over whether they succeed in life. But a recent study finds that Americans' chances of mobility are more determined by factors outside their control than is true for their counterparts across Europe. 

 BODY:
Twoof my colleagues have alluded to a recentPew Research Center report on American exceptionalism, paying particular attention to the fact that Americans are more likely to say their culture is superior to others than are people in Germany, Spain, Britain or France.
One finding of the report that received little attention, however, was about cultural attitudes toward success. Of the five nationalities polled, Americans were least likely to believe that success in life was determined by forces outside our control.
Just 36 percent of Americans believe in this fatalistic statement, while the vast majority of their compatriots are greater believers in self-determination. Put another way, Americans are (not surprisingly) more likely to believe in the American dream.
Americans with less education are more fatalistic, however. The study found that 22 percent of college graduates believe they have little control over their fate, compared to 41 percent of Americans without a college degree.
Even so, American nongraduates still seem to think they have more control over their destinies than the average German, Frenchman or Spaniard does. Almost three-quarters of Germans, for example, believe that success is determined by factors outside our control.
These findings are particularly interesting when juxtaposed with a separate report from the Pew Economic Mobility project. That report, which examined economic and social mobility in 10 Western countries, found that Americans actually appear to have control over their success in life than their counterparts do.
In particular, the educational attainment of a person's parents -- a factor usually determined before that person's birth -- seems to matter more for mobility in the United States.
"There is a stronger link between parental education and children's economic, educational and socio-emotional outcomes than in any other country investigated," the report says.
As Richard Wilkinson suggested in a recent TED Talk, if you want to live the American dream -- and have greater control over your own likelihood of success - you should probably move to Denmark, where the poor have a better chance of moving up in the world.

HEADLINE: Plan to Revive Two ABC Soap Operas Collapses

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: The production company Prospect Park said that it had suspended its Internet-based return of "All My Children" and "One Life to Live" because it couldn't secure contracts with guilds and unions. 

 BODY:
A production company's audacious plan to bring the televised soap operas "All My Children" and "One Life to Live" to the Internet has collapsed.
After four months of negotiations with actors, producers and unions, the company, Prospect Park, said Wednesday that it had suspended its efforts because of financial challenges. In a statement, it said that contractual demands from the unions "coupled with the program's inherent economic challenges" led to the decision.
"We hope that our efforts are not lost, and that we somehow created a dialogue and movement on the feasibility of first-run, network-quality content online," the company said in the statement.
The Web site Deadline.comreported earlier on Wednesday that the company was at an impasse with the guilds and unions that represent actors, writers and other employees on the productions.
The guilds and unions argued that the new contracts for the employees should have nearly the same terms as broadcast television contracts do, while Prospect Park disagreed, since the shows would be shown on the Internet, not on TV. Prospect Park has secured some financing for the productions, but not enough to meet the expectations of the guilds. 
"The truth is, we didn't get the support from the unions that we expected," said a person involved in Prospect Park's plans. "We thought they would be cheering us for saving jobs." The person requested anonymity because the company had decided not to say anything on the record except for the statement.
One of those unions, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represents actors, disputed that account.
"Despite initial progress in our negotiations with Prospect Park toward resolving a fair agreement to cover the performers appearing on these programs, we were perplexed and disappointed that for the past month Prospect Park has not responded to our repeated inquiries to resume those discussions," the union wrote in a statement. "We now conclude from the press reports that Prospect Park faced other challenges unrelated to our negotiations, which prevented continuation of those discussions."
Prospect Park, founded by Jeffrey Kwatinetz and Rich Frank, was hailed as a savior by soap opera fans last summer when it licensed the rights to "All My Children" and "One Life To Live," two soap operas that ABC had cancelled earlier in the year. Mr. Kwatinetz and Mr. Frank said they would distribute the shows through a Web site called THE Online Network and other means.
The plan has been closely watched because nothing quite like it has been tried in the television industry.
The terms of the licensing agreement for the soaps specified that new episodes of the shows would be just as long and as high quality online as they were on TV, giving the unions and guilds some leverage in their negotiations with Prospect Park. In fact, the new producers hit a contractual roadblock with the guilds within weeks of the July 7 licensing announcement.
"We are in the process of working out the essential terms of our proposed collective bargaining agreements with the appropriate guilds and unions, which we must do prior to firming up deals with above- and below-the-line talent," the company said July 25. "We will provide updates as needed."
A trickle of updates about actor, writer and producer deals followed in August and September. But those deals were contingent on final agreement with the actors' union and the Writers Guild.
It gradually became clear that the original timeline for the switch from TV to Internet could not come true. "All My Children," originally scheduled for a September debut online, slipped to January. Earlier this month, it was rumored to have been scrapped altogether so that the producers could concentrate on "One Life to Live."
The person involved in the plan acknowledged that Prospect Park had received more support for the TV-to-Web transition from the "One Life to Live" cast and crew than from the "All My Children" cast and crew.
In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, the Writers Guild of America said: "We were disappointed to learn that Prospect Park's financing fell through. Prior to the end of last week, we were close to a fair deal for the writers."

HEADLINE: Group Led by K.K.R. to Buy Samson for $7.2 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: A consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agreed on Wednesday to buy the Samson Investment Company for about $7.2 billion, in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
A consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agreed on Wednesday to buy the Samson Investment Company, one of the largest privately held energy companies in the country, for about $7.2 billion. It would be one of the biggest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis.
Under the terms of the deal, K.K.R. and its partners will buy all Samson assets except the company's onshore Gulf Coast and offshore deep-water Gulf of Mexico facilities. Those will continue to be owned by Samson's founding Schusterman family, which is still based in Tulsa, Okla.
K.K.R. is teaming up with an eclectic group: Itochu, a Japanese conglomerate, and two other private equity firms, Natural Gas Partners and Crestview Partners.
 The deal is the biggest leveraged buyout of the year, topping the $5.7 billion takeover of Kinetic Partners by Apax Partners. K.K.R. itself claimed one of the biggest leveraged deals of 2010 -- the $5.3 billion acquisition of Del Monte Foods.
The Samson deal is also a return home of sorts for K.K.R. Henry R. Kravis, the private equity firm's co-founder and co-chairman, hails from Tulsa, where his father was an oil engineer. 
"The Schusterman family has built a remarkable company with an extraordinary culture," he said in a statement. "We feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to carry on their commitment to employees, to communities, and to the safe and profitable development of domestic energy resources."
K.K.R. has struck several profitable deals in the oil patch in recent years, buying up exploration companies that focus on the increasingly lucrative shale gas sector. Such companies find and extract oil and natural gas from hardened rock formations in fields across the country, including Oklahoma, Texas and the Appalachian Mountain region.
Samson owns 4,000 wells and has at least partial ownership of more than 12,500 wells. It has a presence in the Marcellus Shale in the Northeast and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. 
The private equity group received financial advice from many banks: Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch; Barclays Capital; BMO Capital Markets; Citigroup; Credit Suisse; RBC Capital Markets; Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company; and Wells Fargo Securities. Itochu received financial advice from Mizuho and Evercore Partners. 
The consortium was also advised by the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.
Samson was advised by Jefferies & Company and the law firm Jones Day.

HEADLINE: Economic Dislocation

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why aren't the Republican candidates talking about their own policy wonks' ideas? 

 BODY:
Just over a week ago, Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia University's business school and an economic adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, gave a pair of interviews on economic policy - one to a liberal writer, Ezra Klein of the Washington Post; the other to a conservative, Jim Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute.
Hubbard discussed his ideal tax reform, his admiration for (and problems with) the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan and his preferred approach to handling future banking crises. And in both interviews, he made a pitch for an immediate response to the country's economic troubles: A corporate tax cut to boost investment combined with a large-scale home mortgage refinancing program, in which the federal government would make it easy for up to 30 million homeowners to refinance their (often-underwater) mortgages at today's historically low rates.
A boost for business and a helping hand for the struggling middle class - why, that almost sounds like an agenda for a presidential campaign. Yet the words "mortgage refinancing" do not appear anywhere in the 59-point, 160-page economic plan that Mitt Romney released in September. (Hubbard himself wrote the foreword.) Romney has allowed that his adviser's idea might merit "further consideration," but to date his only specific prescription for the housing market is the one he delivered in Nevada last month: "Don't try to stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom."
Economists always have more room for creativity than politicians, so it isn't too surprising that there's some disconnect between Hubbard and the candidate he's advising. But the gulf between conservative domestic policy thinkers and Republican politicians is shaping up to be one of the defining realities of the current political season.
In many ways, the Obama presidency has been a good time for conservative public policy ideas. If your only exposure to the American right came from the organs of the conservative intelligentsia - National Review and the Weekly Standard, National Affairs and City Journal and other publications like them - you would think that right-of-center politics was alive with provocative policy debates on the great issues of the day.
In the last two issues alone, for instance, National Review has run a pair of excellent pieces challenging lazy conservative assumptions - one by Scott Winship pointing out that social mobility in America isn't as impressive as many right-wingers like to think, and one by Ramesh Ponnuru dismissing the recent Republican talking point that not enough Americans are paying income tax. Meanwhile, just two years after the journal's debut, one could devise an entire first-term agenda for a Republican president using only back issues of National Affairs. (Interested readers should check out Ponnuru and Robert Stein on family-friendly tax policy, Oliver Hart and Luigi Zingales on reforming Wall Street, Scott Sumner on monetary policy - among many, many others.)
But this intellectual ferment coexists with a Republican primary season whose domestic policy debates have been intellectually vacant even by the low standards of presidential primaries. True, some of the candidates have shown decent instincts: Romney has halfway embraced a plausible blueprint for Medicare reform; Jon Huntsman's proposal for shrinking too-big-too-fail banks deserves some notice; and Rick Santorum has at least been willing to acknowledge that America might have a social mobility problem.
But these ideas aren't where the action is. Instead, the highest-profile proposals have consistently been the dumbest - Tim Pawlenty's fantasy of 5 percent growth, Rick Perry's bent flat tax, and above all Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan. More heterodox ideas on domestic policy have been raised only to be repudiated (or else denounced as treason).
Liberals argue that this pattern reflects a party in thrall to the rigidity of its base, and there's clearly some truth to this. The conservative intelligentsia may be open to fresh thinking, but the conservative movement - the web of professional activists, talk show hosts and single-issue agitators - often inhabits what Steven Hayward, the author of the definitive right-leaning history of the Reagan era, recently called "an ideological and practical straitjacket." In this atmosphere, deviations from a narrow party line are punished more severely than blatant stupidity, and fresh ideas are dismissed or ignored because they don't fit a neat ideological narrative.
But there's more going on than just the base's inflexibility. The caliber of the candidates matters: If Mitt Romney had been joined on the debate stage by a Mitch Daniels, a Jeb Bush, a Bobby Jindal or even Mike Huckabee, the primary season would have taken on a very different cast. Many of the Republican hopefuls sound like one-note ideologues not because the party's electorate demands it, but because they don't have the stature or experience to sound like anything else.
Of course, the political and economic context matters too. Policy innovation always creates losers as well as winners and earns adversaries as well as supporters. But policy innovation in an age of austerity tends to be politically perilous, because the pie seems to be shrinking and everyone's worried about losing his or her own piece.
This is something liberals discovered in the Obama era, when left-wing ideas that had seemed popular when the economy was growing - universal health care and a crusade to reverse global warming - turned out to be less appealing once the music stopped. And it's something the Republican primary candidates are no doubt well aware of today. This is probably the biggest reason why they prefer talking about policy in general terms (government: bad, private sector: good) to acknowledging the specific ways in which we need to start do more with less.
One can practice evasion on the campaign trail and still end up governing boldly once in office. The recent example of Chris Christie, who ran a milquetoast campaign but hasn't shied away from Trenton's toughest fights, attests to that.
However, for a Republican Party that's still trying to rebuild credibility after the profound repudiation it received in 2006 and 2008, campaigning on platitudes and ideological cliches is ultimately more dangerous than taking the plunge into substance. If you don't tell your primary voters what you really hope to do, you risk laying the groundwork for cries of "betrayal" and intra-party civil wars once you start to govern. At the same time, if you don't present general election voters with an agenda that actually addresses their concerns, you risk never getting the chance to govern at all.
Or to put it another way - we know that Mitt Romney listens to Glenn Hubbard and to other experts like him. But if he really wants to be president, he should consider talking more like them as well.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Despite a Rough Year, Hedge Funds Maintain Their Mystique | Hedge funds, the golden children of finance, are not making money the way they used to. Returns for a number of funds, including those of star managers like John A. Paulson, have fallen by as much as half this year.
Yet the money keeps pouring in, even for Mr. Paulson.
This year alone, more than $70 billion in new money has gone to hedge funds, mostly from pensions and endowments. A recent study by the industry tracker Preqin found that 80 percent of investors were weighing new allocations to hedge funds, and 38 percent of investors were planning to add to existing ones. So why would large investors pay hedge funds billions of dollars in fees over the years for those returns? The answer highlights the financial problems at the country's largest pensions. DealBook »

HEADLINE: When is a State's Right Not Right? When Big Donors Are at Stake

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A new concealed carry bill eviscerates the states' rights to set their own gun-control rules. 

 BODY:
Two questions come to mind when I think about states' rights. First, why are we still having this conversation 150 years after the Civil War? And then, what principles govern its modern-day proponents? That second question might just be harder to answer than the first.
One day, the state-rightists (who are mostly, but not all Republicans) are outraged when the Federal government tries to interfere with what they see as the prerogatives of the states to govern themselves - like on same-sex marriage for instance. But the next minute, they're all passionate about hanging onto the Defense of Marriage Act, which requires the federal government to disrespect state decisions on marriage equality.
I'm not the only one who feels confused. Dorothy Samuels, who covers legal affairs for the editorial board, pointed out to me that Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is gasping for breath in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, proclaimed a few months ago that same-sex marriage was an issue for the states to decide. The right-wing erupted over that, as it has a habit of doing, and Mr. Perry backtracked quickly. Now he's in favor of a constitutional amendment barring same-sex unions.
Which brings me to a nasty bit of legislation recently approved by the House. It would require every state to honor the rules of any other state when it comes to carrying concealed weapons. So if you're from a state that allows pretty much anyone to carry a concealed weapon pretty much anywhere, and you travel to a state that actually has sane rules about that sort of thing, you get to pack heat without worry.
Dorothy had this to say about that bill:
As Gail Collins wrote, and we have editorialized, the measure just passed by the House fulfills one of the National Rifle Association's most fervent dreams by eviscerating the authority of states to set their own rules regarding toting concealed loaded guns in public. The bill will be hard to stop in the Senate, where a similar message championed by Republicans and supported by some Democrats was barely defeated not that long ago.
Every Republican House member but one voted for that absurd bill. That included all 10 founding members of a Republican Congressional group devoted to limiting Congressional power. They are Rob Bishop of Utah, Tom Price of Georgia, John Culberson of Texas, Scott Garrett of Wyoming, Michael Conaway of Teas, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Doug Lambom of Colorado and Tom McClintock of California. If you live in one of their districts, you might write and ask why they are using the salary you pay them to extend gun rights, rather than working on fixing the economy.
What makes all of this even more confusing is that just two years ago, Republicans took the opposite stance on states' rights when it came to concealed weapons. They attached a provision to a popular credit card reform bill that allows visitors to national parks and refuges to carry loaded and concealed weapons into national parks, if they have a permit to carry from the state where the national park is located.
I can only imagine how Ranger Smith would react to that news!
But the senate's leading champion of the bill, Tom Coburn, explained helpfully that it was less about guns than about states' rights.
Actually it's more about money than either of those. It's simple. When it comes to a choice between a principle and the NRA, which controls huge amounts of campaign money, the choice seems clear. Just as it does on the issue of same-sex marriage when it comes to a choice between principle and the keepers of right-wing "values" who also hold great sway in election years.

HEADLINE: Romney Says Obama Ad 'Got Under Their Skin'

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney defends a campaign ad that took liberties with the truth. 

 BODY:
DES MOINES - Mitt Romney defended his campaign's first television commercial that takes President Obama's words out of context over his handling of the economy, gleefully telling reporters on Wednesday: "We obviously got under their skin."
 On a campaign visit to Iowa, Mr. Romney used a Thanksgiving analogy to push back against a torrent of criticism from Democrats and independent fact-checkers who said the ad distorted Mr. Obama's comments while campaigning in 2008 when he said, "If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose."
 At the time, Mr. Obama was quoting a statement that his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, had made on the economy. But that point was not included in the ad that is airing this week in New Hampshire.
 The commercial was judged by PolitiFact, a non-partisan campaign watchdog, as "ridiculously misleading." The president's re-election campaign and Democrats called it deceitful and dishonest.
 Mr. Romney, who has sharpened his tone against Mr. Obama and pledged to "take it to them, day in and day out," disagreed. 
 "There was no hidden effort on the part of our campaign," he said. "It was instead to point out that what's sauce for the goose is now sauce for the gander."
 As a puzzled look fell over the eyes of a few reporters at a press conference, Mr. Romney added: "This ad points out that guess what? It's now your turn. The same lines that you used on John McCain are now going to be used on you."

HEADLINE: Economic Trouble in the West Shows Signs of Catching Up With Asia

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Asia's ability to stay resilient amid the West's economic troubles is slowly waning.
For much of this year, the economies of the Asia-Pacific region appeared to be blissfully isolated from the turmoil in other parts of the world. Asian stock markets fell along with those in the rest of the world, but the region's economies continued to power ahead.
Within the last few weeks, however, cracks have emerged in the region's mighty economies, and analysts and policy makers have become more concerned about the painful disruption that could spill into Asia as the situation in Europe continues to deteriorate and the United States' growth remains subdued.
Exports from Asia have been softening for months as demand in Europe, in particular, has slowed. Although many countries depend less on exports than they once did, the sector remains crucial for economies like those of Taiwan and South Korea and for the small, open economies of Hong Kong and Singapore, economists say. 
''The potential risks for Asia have increased'' as the European crisis has moved beyond small peripheral economies like Greece, enveloping larger countries like Italy, Spain and even France, said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong.
The spreading economic troubles were underscored Wednesday when a closely watched gauge showed Chinese manufacturing contracting. The reading, published by HSBC, dropped from 51 in October to 48 in November, the lowest level in nearly three years and much lower than economists had expected. A reading of 50 is the line between expansion and contraction.
The decline fanned worries about the spillover of the West's problems into Asia. But it also reinforced nervousness about the effect in the opposite direction: the West increasingly needs a strong Asia to buy its goods as consumers elsewhere stay on the sidelines.
''Europe is now where the United States was three years ago: The economic contraction is only just beginning,'' said Pranay Gupta, chief investment officer for the Asia-Pacific region at ING Investment Management in Hong Kong.
So far, the economic pain in Asia has been relatively muted, and much of the region remains on course for strong growth.
The Chinese economy is set to expand 9.5 percent this year, according to projections from the International Monetary Fund in September. India is expected to grow 7.8 percent, Indonesia 6.4 percent, and many other Southeast Asian nations more than 5 percent, the I.M.F. estimates.
Those figures, however, are generally below the growth rates seen in 2010, and are likely to ease off further next year, the I.M.F. and most economists say.
Reacting to the worsening global environment, Indonesia and Australia have lowered interest rates in recent weeks. Most other central banks in the region have put off rate increases that seemed likely only months ago fears about growth replace inflation concerns.
In Japan, the pain has been compounded by the results of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March and by the persistent strength of the yen. Fanned by the economic difficulties in other parts of the world, the currency's rise has made Japanese goods more expensive for shoppers abroad and has helped dent exporters' profits.
With interest rates already at rock bottom, the government has resorted to direct intervention in the currency markets -- selling yen for dollars -- four times in little more than a year in its effort to weaken the yen.
In the financial sector, meanwhile, banks like HSBC, UBS and Nomura are cutting jobs around the globe. And although many banks would like to grow in the Asia-Pacific region, financial centers like Hong Kong and Singapore have not escaped the hiring freezes and job cuts.
''There are still pockets of hiring in the Asian financial sector, but it has got a lot tougher in recent months,'' said Matthew Bennett, managing director at the recruitment firm Robert Walters in Hong Kong.
With the crisis in the euro zone spilling into ever-bigger economies, the worry now is that the ripples into Asia could grow. Analysts have begun to fret that beleaguered European banks could sharply scale back their lending to Asia and other emerging markets as they adjust to tighter capital rules that are to be introduced next year.
Overall bank lending remained stable through the first half of 2011, the World Bank wrote in a report on the economies of East Asia, released Tuesday. Any sudden shutdown in credit markets, of the sort that happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, would have painful repercussions for Asia.
In the six months after that crisis, the World Bank said in its report, international banks reduced their exposure to companies in developing East Asian countries by $36 billion.
''Asia's financial systems overall have sufficient liquidity to finance more growth and could step into the breach. But if European banks were to withdraw lending from the region, that would be highly disruptive, as it would take some adjustment time before lending shortfalls are bridged,'' said Mr. Neumann of HSBC, adding that growth in Asia had also become more dependent on credit in recent years.
The ability of companies to raise cash via the capital markets has already been crimped.
Asian stock markets have largely shrugged off the region's favorable economic fundamentals this year and have fallen sharply. The key indexes in Hong Kong, India and Taiwan are all down about 20 percent since the start of this year; that is more or less in line with the Euro Stoxx 50's performance.
Proceeds from stock market debuts in the Asia-Pacific region have likewise tumbled, to about $74 billion so far this year, compared with nearly $159 billion during the same period last year, according to data from Reuters.
Despite all that, however, many economists and investment strategists say they believe that the region as a whole remains relatively well positioned.
Hiring outside the financial sector -- especially in retail, consumer goods and hospitality -- remains dynamic, headhunters like Mr. Bennett report.
Unemployment rates across the region are far below those in the West (3.3 percent in Hong Kong, for example; 3.1 percent in South Korea; 5.2 percent in Australia -- compared with 9 percent in the United States and 10.2 percent in the euro zone), so consumers remain willing to spend.
Rising affluence also has turned populous nations like China, India and Indonesia into major markets for goods, helping to make up for some of the demand drop-off from Europe and the United States.
Moreover, most Asian economies, with the exception of Japan, do not have sovereign debt like that weighing on Europe and the United States. For example, the yield on 10-year bonds issued by Indonesia is now below those of Spain and Italy, a previously almost inconceivable situation that shows how confidence levels have shifted.

HEADLINE: More Vigorous Test for Banks

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and EDWARD HADAS

 BODY:
There's good and bad news in the Federal Reserve's decision to expand the scope of its annual stress test of the nation's top banks. Given the deteriorating economic picture, submitting the 31 largest lenders to even more scrutiny than in the previous two years makes sense. So does putting the European exposures of the top six banks under the microscope. But the Fed's latest move will leave many on both sides of the Atlantic unhappy.
Start with the United States angle. The Fed is expanding its stress test beyond the 19 largest banks to include another 12 with $50 billion of assets or more, including Discover Financial as well as the United States subsidiaries of several foreign banks like HSBC. Considering that several midsize banks landed in trouble in the last crisis, bringing them into the fold is overdue. 
The Fed is making all 31 banks run some pretty depressing numbers through their models: an 8 percent contraction in the gross domestic product, the Dow Jones industrial average collapsing to 5,700 points by the middle of next year, and an unemployment rate rising above 13 percent by 2013. The six largest banks must demonstrate they can also withstand a euro zone crash that whacks European governments and financial institutions.
The test probably means few, if any, banks will be allowed to raise dividends or buy back more stock next year. Instead, they will have to hang onto their capital. And the test ought to make it much harder to cast aspersions on the creditworthiness of any bank that passes.
But the process will take time. Banks have until January to file their results and, based on this year's exercise, results aren't likely to be known until April. By that time, the United States and European crises that the Fed imagines could be under way. Pity the bank that is told to raise capital in such an environment.
Meanwhile, Europe looks set to suffer even more. American banks are already reining in their exposure to the euro zone. But the mere fact that the Fed is increasing scrutiny of their exposures could accelerate the withdrawal. That increases the risk that the stress possibilities become reality.
A Troubled Haven
By the standards of the euro zone, Germany is still a haven. But as the overall area keeps looking less safe, investors are starting to notice that, for all its strengths, Germany does lie within it.
On Wednesday, a German government bond offering was badly undersubscribed; bids were accepted for only 61 percent of the 6 billion euro issue. The norm is more like 90 percent.
The bonds that were sold yielded 1.98 percent, still comfortably low as far the government is concerned. But that was 0.1 of a percentage point more than the day's low, and yields climbed another 0.09 percentage points later. By afternoon, the German paper, or bunds as they are known, yielded 0.24 percentage points more than comparable United States debt. Just a week ago, the gap was similar but in the opposite direction.
This is far from a sign of total panic. Even so, the trend is hard to deny and easy to explain. Investors are taking money out of the euro zone. The European Central Bank reported that non-euro area investors were net sellers of 52 billion euros of member government bonds in the third quarter, having bought 130 billion euros' worth in the second. German bunds may be the safest European holdings, but as fear mounts they too begin to look unnecessarily risky.
The objective of shunning everything euro related is to stay out of the way of a possible euro collapse. Never mind that the exodus makes that collapse more likely: when investors want out, they run first and ask questions later. And Germany would suffer from a splintering of the euro. While the country would eventually be an economic success with its own currency, a disorderly euro breakup would trash both the financial system and the export business of the zone's leading creditor and exporter.
European authorities have already missed many opportunities to calm investors down with relatively mild measures. One remaining possible move, resisted so far by Berlin, is for the euro zone to guarantee bonds issued by member nations. Even that would, in theory, dilute Germany's strong credit a bit. But a disintegration of the euro zone would be far worse. The weak bund auction is a signal for the region's politicians and central bankers to stop squabbling.

HEADLINE: Russia Elevates Warning About U.S. Missile-Defense Plan in Europe

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia will deploy its own missiles and could withdraw from the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty if the United States moves forward with its plans for a missile-defense system in Europe, President Dmitri A. Medvedev warned on Wednesday.
''I have set the task to the armed forces to develop measures for disabling missile-defense data and control systems,'' Mr. Medvedev said. 
He said new Russian strategic ballistic missiles ''will be equipped with advanced missile defense penetration systems and new highly effective warheads'' and he reiterated Russia's warning that it would deploy tactical missiles to the western territory of Kaliningrad, which borders Poland.
But it was Mr. Medvedev's comments about the New Start treaty, put into effect this year, that suggested a darkening tone in what has been a steady drumbeat of warnings out of Moscow in recent days over the plans for a missile-defense system based in Europe.
''In the case of unfavorable development of the situation, Russia reserves the right to discontinue further steps in the field of disarmament and arms control,'' Mr. Medvedev said in a televised address from his residence just outside Moscow.
''Given the intrinsic link between strategic offensive and defensive arms, conditions for our withdrawal from the New Start treaty could also arise,'' he said.
Several times in his address, Mr. Medvedev reiterated his call for further negotiations between Russia and the United States, but such talks seem unlikely to change the strongly held views on each side.
At issue is the Europe-based system being developed by the United States that it says would defend against a potential missile attack by Iran. The United States has reached agreements to place 24 interceptor missiles in Romania, as well as a sophisticated radar system in Turkey.
Russia believes that that system could be used against its intercontinental ballistic missiles and has demanded assurance in writing that this would not be the case. The United States has said it will not agree to any restrictions on its missile-defense efforts.
Mr. Medvedev raised the issue directly with President Obama this month at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Hawaii. After those face-to-face talks, Mr. Medvedev said, ''Our positions remain far apart.''
Since then, he and other Russian officials have made a steady stream of public statements warning of the consequences of a failure by the two sides to reach some accommodation.
American officials insist that the Europe-based missile-defense system was intended to address a threat from Iran -- a position that was reiterated by the White House and the Pentagon after Mr. Medvedev's televised remarks on Wednesday.
''In multiple channels, we have explained to Russian officials that the missile-defense systems planned for deployment in Europe do not and cannot threaten Russia's strategic deterrent, said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ''Implementation of the New Start Treaty is going well is going well and we see no basis for threats to withdraw from it. ''We continue to believe that cooperation with Russia on missile defense can enhance the security of the United States, our allies in Europe, and Russia, and we will continue to work with Russia to define the parameters of possible cooperation.''
Mr. Obama ordered a major redesign of the missile-defense plans he had inherited from his predecessor, George W. Bush, opting to move the system closer to Iran and to build it faster. Mr. Bush had favored placing interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic.
In his remarks, Mr. Medvedev said there was still room for negotiation. But he accused the United States and NATO of being unwilling to consider Russia's point of view. ''They are not going, at least as of today, to take into consideration our concerns about the architecture of the European missile defense system,'' he said, ''They are saying, 'This is not against you, don't worry.' They are trying to calm us down.''
But in what was clearly a reference to the United States Congress, Mr. Medvedev said there were reasons not to trust the assurances from the Obama administration. ''Legislators in some countries openly state,'' he said, '' This is against you.' ''

HEADLINE: Kyrgyzstan Sees Regional Instability at End of NATO's Afghan Mission

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The departing president of Kyrgyzstan, the small but strategically important Central Asian country that houses a vital American air base for supplying the NATO war effort in neighboring Afghanistan, expressed deep concern on Wednesday about the potential for a contagious economic collapse in Afghanistan when foreign military forces withdraw.
The president, Roza Otunbayeva, whose term expires in a week, said she feared that Afghanistan had grown so accustomed to protracted deprivation and war that it was unprepared for adjusting to life without the enormous foreign military presence, which has also become an important economic underpinning in Afghanistan. The American-led NATO forces, which have been battling a Taliban insurgency for more than 10 years, are scheduled to depart in 2014. 
Without the development of businesses in Afghanistan besides its illicit but lucrative opium trade, Ms. Otunbayeva said, the economic impact of the NATO pullout could destabilize Afghanistan and its neighbors by unleashing a flood of unemployed Afghan refugees, armed extremists and crime.
''I think the region is in dismay over what will happen, how to cope with all these problems,'' she said in an interview at The New York Times. If the NATO strategy to defeat the Taliban consisted of ''only military operations, and withdrawal in 2014, of course it will be worse,'' the president said.
Ms. Otunbayeva said that Kyrgyzstan had been helping to train Afghan civilians in customs protocols and microfinance -- efforts that have been appreciated by the United States -- and that other countries should be doing ''everything possible to integrate Afghans into a normal life.''
Her concern echoed a World Bank report, released on Tuesday, that warned that Afghanistan could suffer a devastating recession in 2014 and beyond because of the impending vacuum created by the military withdrawal and dwindling aid. More than 90 percent of Afghanistan's annual budget comes from foreign donors.
Ms. Otunbayeva, 61, has held a number of political posts in Kyrgyzstan, one of the poorest, most isolated and politically volatile of the former Soviet republics, which nonetheless has enormous strategic importance to Russia and the United States. She has led an interim government there since an uprising that forced out a predecessor, Kurmanbek S. Bakiyev, in 2010, and has won compliments for overseeing changes that have led to a stable parliamentary democracy.
Almazbek Atambayev, the interim prime minister, is Kyrgyzstan's first elected leader since the country gained its independence two decades ago. He was elected in a vote that international monitors considered clean and fair.
Mr. Atambayev said after his election last month that he would seek to close the American-run base that ferries supplies to NATO forces in Afghanistan when its lease expires in 2014, partly because he feared it could become a security risk. The base, officially known as a transit center, is at the Manas airport near the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.
Ms. Otunbayeva had a more flexible view of the base, suggesting in the interview that it was premature to say what would happen until much closer to the lease expiration date. She also said the base could be put to other uses. ''We could turn this transit center into a civil transit center in the future,'' she said. ''I think it's one of the options, how to use this infrastructure.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 26, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the outgoing president of Kyrgyzstan and her concern over events in Afghanistan misstated the time frame during which Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic, gained independence. It was two decades ago, in 1991 -- not one decade ago.

HEADLINE: In a Small Texas Town, A Fight Over Late Drinks

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
GUN BARREL CITY, Tex. -- The American political divide is often characterized as red versus blue. But some of the most intense political battles in small-town Texas are fought on a far older division: wet versus dry.
To many residents of this East Texas town, which has long been caught up in the folklore of the Wild West, Mayor Dennis R. Wood has the worst sort of drinking problem. He has a problem with the culture of drinking. Late-night drinking in particular.
Mr. Wood tried to stop the town from allowing restaurants to serve alcohol until 2 a.m. on the weekends, a campaign that has put his political future in jeopardy and has cost him friendships, City Council support and about $1,000 in local newspaper advertising and signs. What happened in Gun Barrel City was about a simple matter -- five extra hours of drinking per week. But it was also about so much more: God, jobs, politics, chain restaurants and diner disputes, all in a friendly little town that happens to have a two-pistol logo above the doors of City Hall. 
The mayor and his supporters, some of whom attend the same Baptist church, believe that the move to extend late-night drinking will lead to an increase in drunken driving arrests and contribute to the ''moral decline'' of the town of 5,672. His opponents believe Mr. Wood and his pastor were imposing their anti-alcohol religious views on a place with no shortage of bars and drive-through liquor stores. But the real issue for many residents was not alcohol but Applebee's, which vowed to open a restaurant in Gun Barrel City when the drinking hours were extended. The mayor said he had nothing against Applebee's, but that he opposed the extension of drinking hours on moral grounds.
Residents have called for Mr. Wood to step down, but instead he plans on running for re-election. Two members of the City Council who had attended Mr. Wood's church now worship elsewhere on Sundays. Relations may never be the same between patrons of the Huddle House diner and a bar called Rita's Club, though the two are separated by just nine-tenths of a mile.
The diner's general manager, Linda Whitworth, supported the mayor; the bar's co-owner, Rob Rea, did not. One day last month, after a brief exchange at the Huddle House cash register, Ms. Whitworth called the police, accusing Mr. Rea of misdemeanor assault after he shook her hand too hard and too long as they debated the merits of late-night drinking in Gun Barrel City.
Mr. Wood and Mr. Rea, like many Texans on opposite sides of the wet-dry debate, live in different worlds.
One recent afternoon, Mr. Wood, 57, an accountant, sat in his office, with a Southern Baptist Convention resolution from 2006 urging Southern Baptists to support legislation curbing alcohol use on the desk in front of him.
''There's no reason to drink between midnight and 2 a.m.,'' he said. ''It just creates more problems than profits. When they leave they're going to be a little more intoxicated than if they would have left at midnight.''
Nearby in Rita's Club, Mr. Rea, 46, sat at a booth in his dimly lighted bar, a stack of cash on his left, a bottle of Budweiser on his right and a piece of advice posted overhead reading, ''Love your enemy, but keep your gun oiled.'' He spent nine years on the rodeo circuit but now works as a bail bondsman (''You Ring, We Spring'' read his business cards). Between puffs of a cigarette and sips of his Bud, he denied he did anything wrong at the Huddle House that day, and said he saw the effort to stop late-night drinking in restaurants as anti-business and anti-American.
''It's indicative of a mind-set that's becoming real prevalent, not only in this town, but this state, the whole country,'' Mr. Rea said. ''People don't like to be told what to do.''
Dozens of towns and counties in the state are considered wet, meaning all sales of alcoholic beverages are allowed, but Gun Barrel City and numerous others restrict the sale of beer, wine and liquor in whole or, confusingly, in part, rendering them dry to some degree.
In Three Rivers in South Texas, you can buy a six-pack at a store, but not a bottle of wine or whiskey, because the town is wet for beer only. In Vega, just outside Amarillo, you can order a drink at Boot Hill Saloon and Grill, but you cannot buy liquor at a store, because alcohol sales for off-premises consumption are prohibited. Even Houston, the state's biggest city, is officially considered ''partly wet.''
Gun Barrel City -- its motto is ''We Shoot Straight With You'' -- is a fast-growing town 55 miles southeast of Dallas. The nearby Cedar Creek Lake serves as a popular weekend escape for the Dallas region, and many residents are former weekenders who settled down in the area after retirement.
Stores in the town are allowed to sell beer, wine and liquor, but restaurants and bars can do so only with state-issued ''private club'' permits.
In June, the City Council voted 5 to 0 to pass an ordinance allowing restaurants to serve alcohol until 2 a.m. three nights a week, as part of an effort to woo Applebee's, which town officials said had requested the extension. The mayor vetoed the measure, and then the Council unanimously overrode the veto, and then the mayor gathered enough signatures to put the issue on the ballot.
There were e-mail blasts, Facebook pages and rival rallies on the same day. Pastors and members of local churches took sides, both for and against. The owner of Vetoni's Italian restaurant stayed neutral (fitting its B.Y.O.B. status).
Dennis Baade, a member of the City Council and the town's Economic Development Corporation, said an Applebee's restaurant would create roughly 75 jobs and bring in $80,000 in additional sales tax revenue each year. For Mr. Baade, who supported late-night drinking, the issue was about the jobs, but it was also personal: his father was killed by a drunken driver. ''I understand the evils of alcohol, but I also understand all these people living below poverty,'' he said.
The vote on the referendum was held Nov. 8. Though only a small fraction of the town's 3,579 registered voters cast their ballots, it was still a record turnout: More people voted than in last year's mayoral election. Mr. Wood lost -- 262 voted to repeal the late-night drinking ordinance, and 481 voted against the repeal.
The mayor said voters had spoken. But a bingo hall in town has a room filled with Las Vegas-style slot machines, and on a recent stroll there, he questioned the legality of such establishments. He vowed to make it his next priority.

HEADLINE: Opening Day For Shoppers Shows Divide

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
As the busiest retail weekend of the year begins late Thursday night, the differences between how affluent and more ordinary Americans shop in the uncertain economy will be on unusually vivid display.
Budget-minded shoppers will be racing for bargains at ever-earlier hours while the rich mostly will not be bothering to leave home.
Toys ''R'' Us, Wal-Mart, Macy's, Kohl's, Best Buy and Target will start their Black Friday sales earlier than ever -- at 9 and 10 p.m. in some instances -- with dirt-cheap offers intended to secure their customers' limited dollars. A half a day later, on Friday morning, higher-end stores like Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom will open with only a sprinkling of special sales. 
The low-end and midrange retailers are risking low margins as they cut prices to attract shoppers, while executives at luxury stores say that they are actually able to sell more at full price than in recent boom years.
''We're now into a less promotional environment than we were before the recession,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks. In the third quarter, for instance, Saks reduced the length of an annual sale to three days from four, and excluded the high-margin category of cosmetics from another regular sale.
Retail analysts are expecting a decent holiday season, with manyestimating that sales will increase about 3 percent over last year, with contributions from shoppers across income levels. Yet the Friday after Thanksgiving, the kickoff to the highest-revenue weeks for stores, is expected to lay bare the increasingly parallel universes of retailing in America, the analysts said.
''Those in a more modest income situation are the people who are going to the Wal-Marts and the Best Buys and the Targets at 8, 9, 10, 11 p.m. with little kids in tow because they can't afford a baby sitter,'' said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consultant firm. ''It's a very unpleasant shopping experience, frankly, for a lot of people.''
Meanwhile, many affluent shoppers will avoid the scene altogether, he said. ''The women who are shopping the fourth floor at Saks are not Black Friday shoppers,'' he said.
Still, a deal is a deal. High-end consumers and the people racing for the Black Friday special on $9.44 blenders at Wal-Mart continue to have at least one thing in common: they know hot holiday products go quickly.
For that reason, lines outside some Best Buy stores began forming Wednesday morning (the chain will sell a limited number of $500 high-definition televisions for $200 starting at midnight Thursday). And Neiman Marcus sold out of pewter-color Ferraris (luggage set matching the interior included) at $395,000 each within 50 minutes of making 10 of them available through its ''fantasy'' holiday catalog late last month.
Analysts said that luxury stores had outpaced discount and midtier stores in sales growth at stores open at least a year for most of 2011. Yet, all American consumers were still showing surprisingly strong spending patterns, and they expected that to hold going into the holiday season.
''From an overall level of spending, we're going to be well ahead of where we were last year,'' said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities who tracks consumer spending. ''That's surprising to a lot of folks, because we're stuck with 9 percent unemployment.''
Mr. Vitner expects holiday sales to grow 5.2 percent this year, a higher estimate than many analysts predict. He said holiday spending had increased nearly every year recently, except for 2008, and that the population growth and even modest income growth helped buoy that pattern.
Low- and middle-income shoppers ''are the folks that are really getting squeezed -- in the third quarter of this year, real incomes actually declined and the savings rate declined,'' he said. Yet he expects their spending to remain steady, even if they have to pull money from savings or charge items to credit cards. The economy, he said, ''will affect lower-income shoppers in how they shop, not how much they buy -- I think they will hone in on the discounts.''
And there are plenty of discounts, promotions and financing programs as lower-end stores try to get people to spend.
Wal-Mart's profits declined in the third quarter as it kept many prices low so its shoppers could afford them. ''There is a real sense that the economic strain is taking its toll,'' Michael T. Duke, Wal-Mart's chief executive, told analysts. It also brought back its layaway program in October for the first time in several years, and executives said the program, which lets people pay for gifts over $15 over several weeks, has brought extra traffic into the stores.
Kohl's, like Wal-Mart, has increased its marketing to highlight its discounts, said Kevin Mansell, the chief executive and chairman.
''If you talk to people who are in my business, people who analyze our business, they would consistently tell you that stores at the mall, especially anchor stores, are more promotional than they were last year,'' he said. ''Now that may not be true at the high end -- the strength of the business or the higher-end consumer has allowed them to do a little less promotion -- but that's high end.''
At Saks Fifth Avenue and other luxury stores, full-price selling has generally been increasing. So the few deals at luxury stores on Friday are not so much bargains as token nods to the Black Friday tradition. Saks is offering half off cashmere sweaters, Neiman Marcus is giving discounts on a future shopping trip when people spend more than $100, while Nordstrom says it does not have big promotions planned.
High-end retailers ''don't have to do anything desperate -- it's kind of hard to see a 5 a.m. queue outside of a Fifth Avenue luxury retailer,'' said Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in Accenture's retail practice. ''If you don't have to put it on sale and people are still going to buy it, why put it on sale?''

HEADLINE: The Poor, the Near Poor and You

 BODY:
What is it like to be poor? Thankfully, most Americans do not know, at least not firsthand. And times are tough for the middle class. But everyone needs to recognize a chilling reality: One in three Americans -- 100 million people -- is either poor or perilously close to it.
The Times's Jason DeParle, Robert Gebeloff and Sabrina Tavernise reported recently on Census data showing that 49.1 million Americans are below the poverty line -- in general, $24,343 for a family of four. An additional 51 million are in the next category, which they termed ''near poor'' -- with incomes less than 50 percent above the poverty line. 
As for all of that inspirational, up-by-their-bootstrap talk you hear on the Republican campaign trail, over half of the near poor in the new tally actually fell into that group from higher income levels as their resources were sapped by medical expenses, taxes, work-related costs and other unavoidable outlays.
The worst downturn since the Great Depression is only part of the problem. Before that, living standards were already being eroded by stagnating wages and tax and economic policies that favored the wealthy.
Conservative politicians and analysts are spouting their usual denial. Gov. Rick Perry and Representative Michele Bachmann have called for taxing the poor and near poor more heavily, on the false grounds that they have been getting a free ride. In fact, low-income workers do pay up, if not in federal income taxes, then in payroll taxes and state and local taxes.
Asked about the new census data, Robert Rector, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation told The Times that the ''emotionally charged terms 'poor' or 'near poor' clearly suggest to most people a level of material hardship that doesn't exist.'' Heritage has its own, very different ranking system, based on households' ''amenities.'' According to that, the typical poor household has roughly 14 of 30 amenities. In other words, how hard can things be if you have a refrigerator, air-conditioner, coffee maker, cellphone, and other stuff?
The rankings ignore the fact that many of these are requisites of modern life and that things increasingly out of reach for the poor and near poor -- education, health care, child care, housing and utilities -- are the true determinants of a good, upwardly mobile life.
Government surveys analyzed by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities indicate that in 2010, just over half of the country's nearly 17 million poor children, lived in households that reported at least one of four major hardships: hunger, overcrowding, failure to pay the rent or mortgage on time or failure to seek needed medical care. A good education is also increasingly out of reach. A study by Martha Bailey, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, showed that the difference in college-graduation rates between the rich and poor has widened by more than 50 percent since the 1990s.
There is also a growing out-of-sight-out-of-mind problem. A study, by Sean Reardon, a sociologist at Stanford, shows that Americans are increasingly living in areas that are either poor or affluent. The isolation of the prosperous, he said, threatens their support for public schools, parks, mass transit and other investments that benefit broader society.
The poor do without and the near poor, at best, live from paycheck to paycheck. Most Americans don't know what that is like, but unless the nation reverses direction, more are going to find out.

HEADLINE: German Debt Auction Weighs on Markets

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Julie Creswell and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States and Europe declined and the dollar rose sharply on Wednesday after a German bond auction disappointed investors and new data pointed to continued uncertainty in the global economy.
Germany, which was seeking to raise as much as 6 billion euros, or $8.1 billion, in an auction of 10-year bonds, met demand for only 3.9 billion euros' worth, leaving the state with twice as many leftovers as normal, the Bundesbank reported. The bonds, considered the safest government securities in the euro zone, were priced at an average yield of 1.98 percent, slightly above the prevailing market price.
Light trading volume on Wall Street before Thanksgiving on Thursday worsened the market trend, said Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy at Glenmede Investment and Wealth Management. 
''Beyond that, this situation in Europe is definitely very worrying for a lot of investors,'' he said. ''They have yet to put together a plan that makes sense, and that leaves open this gaping hole of potential downside effects.''
At the close of trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 2.21 percent to 1,161.79. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 236.17 points, or 2.05 percent, to 11,257.55, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 2.43 percent to 2,460.08.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, fell 1.9 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London fell 1.3 percent. German shares were down 1.4 percent, and in Paris, the CAC 40 fell 1.7 percent.
The dollar gained against other major currencies. The euro fell more than 1 percent to $1.3336 in New York.
The weak demand for the German bond offering suggested that investors did not want to invest in Europe as a whole, Mr. Pride said, rather than signaling fears of a German default.
Elsewhere in the bond market, the United States 10-year government bond rose 10/32 to 101 1/32. The yield on the bond fell to 1.89 percent, from 1.92 percent late Tuesday. The yield on the comparable German bond was up 0.16 percentage points at 2.08 percent.
David Joy, chief market strategist with Ameriprise Financial, said that economic figures had been showing a weak economy in Europe for some time and that he believed that the weak auction demand was a ''significant factor,'' noting that the German bond yields were now about the same level as those in Britain.
A weakening of manufacturing activity in China and the euro zone also weighed on sentiment, while data in the United States continued to show a slower recovery.
A European index based on a survey of euro zone purchasing managers showed manufacturing output in the 17-nation bloc falling for a fourth consecutive month, dropping at the steepest rate since June 2009, Markit, a data services provider said. A separate index tracking services activity fell for a third consecutive month, Markit said.
Myles Zyblock, the chief institutional strategist and managing director for capital markets research at RBC Capital Markets, said that Europe's economic woes in general were weighing on American investor sentiment after the soft economic figures that were released on Wednesday.
''It is definitely saying that the risks of European recession are very high,'' Mr. Zyblock said.
But he added that the reports from China also were probably affecting the financial markets.
''Multinationals have big exposure globally,'' he said.
In the United States, the Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods fell 0.7 percent in October, compared with 0.8 percent in September. Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, a proxy for future business investment, fell 1.8 percent, the department said, after a 2.4 percent increase in September.
''Capital goods order activity in October was disappointing, and the up and down movement reflects the uncertainty that exists in the economy,'' said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance.
In addition, initial filings for jobless benefits rose by the end of last week, to 393,000, the Labor Department said, or slightly higher than the 390,000 forecast. Consumer spending also continued to show weakness.

HEADLINE: Retooling Intellectual History

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
Were the 1970s the most boring decade in history?
In 1972, The New York Times reported on the Ford Motor Company's plan to fight boredom on the job and an alternative boredom-reduction plan put forward by the United Auto Workers. The Washington Post, meanwhile, fretted that boredom might be fueling interest in the occult. In 1976, Reader's Digest declared boredom ''the disease of our time.'' 
But boredom isn't just boring, Jordan Grant, a graduate student at American University, contends in ''Meaning in the Malaise: Boredom and the Remaking of the American Mind in the Seventies,'' a paper delivered last week at an intellectual history conference at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Boredom is also a window into important shifts in American intellectual life, as well as a new frontier for the sometimes embattled scholars who study it.
Mr. Grant's paper and the conference where he presented it are part of a resurgence in the fortunes of intellectual history, a discipline long dismissed if not as boring, then as musty, elitist and out of touch.
Today, however, a new breed of young intellectual historian has paid increased attention to questions of race, class and gender, without losing hold of the premise that ideas matter.
''Big ideas affect everybody,'' said Andrew Hartman, a professor at Illinois State University and president of the newly formed Society for U.S. Intellectual History, which sponsored the conference. ''It's not elitist to talk about them.''
The society, formed this summer, aims to raise the profile of intellectual history, even if job listings for intellectual historians remain scarce.
''We're all scholars trying to get tenure,'' Michael O'Connor, a professor at Georgia State University and one of the conference's organizers, said. ''But a lot of us are also interested in public discourse, in attracting a different audience.''
The conference included papers on the artists Robert Rauschenberg and Barnett Newman, the philosopher Stanley Cavell and the history of the critical reception of ''Moby-Dick.''
But the lineup tilted markedly toward postwar political history, with discussions of charged topics like the economist Friedrich von Hayek's writings on the rule of law, Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 1965 report on the black family and the theories of the evangelical thinker Francis Schaeffer, who has been much in the news because of his supposed influence on Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a Republican presidential candidate.
Asked about the conference's political emphasis, Mr. O'Connor cited the jurist Richard A. Posner's definition of a public intellectual as an intellectual interested in politics. ''When I first read that I thought it was dumb and reactive,'' Mr. O'Connor said. ''But he's right.'' JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

HEADLINE: More Lawyers Skip The Partner Track To Be Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
Five and a half years ago, after spending years as commercial litigation lawyers at Proskauer Rose in New York City, Sari Gabay-Rafiy and Anne Marie Bowler decided to strike out on their own. They started Gabay-Rafiy & Bowler more as a lifestyle choice than a money-making venture. The first year in business, Ms. Gabay-Rafiy said, she made ''just enough to pay the babysitter.''
Over time, Ms. Gabay-Rafiy and Ms. Bowler learned to re-evaluate their business practices continually to assess what was useful and profitable. That led to their decision in 2009 to move to smaller office space and to discontinue storing files offsite. Moving cut their rent 35 percent (they sublet two offices in the new space to nonlawyers) and storing files onsite saved them about $300 a month.
They run a lean operation -- just the two of them and one assistant -- and they rely on their connections to an informal network of lawyers for everything from expert advice to case referrals. They sent announcements to every lawyer they knew when they left Proskauer, and they exchange business cards everywhere they go: seminars, continuing education courses, cocktail parties, networking events, even elementary school drop-offs. 
Today, despite the recession, the firm is thriving. The partners say they have exceeded what they were earning when they left Proskauer. And they are part of what appears to be a trend of lawyers in their mid-20s to early 40s leaving large firms to start their own small ones.
Statistics are not easy to come by, but Margie R. Grossberg, a partner at the legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, said she saw an increasing number of associates choosing entrepreneurship. ''In the past, associates found if they worked really hard and did the right things, they made partner,'' she said. ''That's not necessarily the case anymore. The odds are a lot slimmer, and it's also not as coveted as it once was.'' These lawyers want more control over their futures, Ms. Grossberg said, and they do not want to wait until they become partner to have meaningful relationships with clients.
The economy is another factor. ''There have been thousands of associates laid off because of the recession,'' said Eric A. Seeger, a principal at Altman Weil, a legal consultancy. ''We're seeing more lawyers out there now taking risks, and that includes going out on their own.''
Starting a law firm presents many challenges, especially for associates who have not had much experience running a firm. Michael Yim, Jane Chuang and a third lawyer, all former law school classmates, decided to start a firm in Manhattan last year, taking one large client with them. Three months later that client dropped them, taking 75 percent of the fledging firm's revenue. Mr. Yim and Ms. Chuang's third partner could not stomach the loss, and the relationship between the three became tense. He soon left, but Mr. Yim and Ms. Chuang soldiered on. ''We started from scratch again, taking a long-term view of profit generation,'' Mr. Yim said.
The firm became Yim & Chuang and now, a year later, business is better than Mr. Yim had projected, although marketing has been difficult. ''There aren't a lot of people who know about us yet,'' he said. Still, he and Ms. Chuang decided not to take work they could not handle or simply did not want, even when it was tempting. ''You can get this sense of desperation where you'll take any paying client that walks through the door,'' Mr. Yim said. ''We've learned the best clients are people we would socialize with, because the relationship is comfortable, there is trust and it's far more productive.''
In 2007 Joel Kauth and two of his colleagues left Christie Parker Hale in Irvine, Calif., to start Kauth, Pomeroy, Peck & Bailey with Kent Pomeroy, a lawyer and accountant. Mr. Kauth and his former Christie colleagues did not like the traditional billable-hours structure, so they decided to give clients a flat rate for services. ''Clients love us because we give them predictability,'' Mr. Kauth said. ''It's not some billable black hole.''
The billing system has been profitable for the firm because its partners have enough experience to estimate their time, and they give specific prices for particular tasks. Still, once in a while, Mr. Kauth said, ''if the court is being difficult or opposing counsel is crazy, the cost goes up and we just have to eat it.''
The firm bills up front when the costs for third-party services like document production or expert witnesses is high. ''Large firms have an infrastructure in place that can absorb big purchases for a large case,'' Mr. Kauth said. ''When you've got three or four people, it's much tougher. I can't front $300,000 on a project.'' Clients are generally understanding, he said, and the firm gives them the vendor's bill, so they see there is no markup.
Shortly after the firm started, Mr. Pomeroy decided to pursue other career opportunities, but he provided financial guidance to the legal start-up and designed its accounting system. At first, he said, his former colleagues did not understand the costs involved in running a law firm. ''These guys didn't pay the bills at Christie,'' he said. ''They didn't realize that lawyers are the last ones to get paid after rent, LexisNexis, paralegals, secretaries, utilities, workers' compensation insurance, payroll taxes -- all the things needed to run the firm.''
Before Mr. Kauth and his colleagues left their jobs, Mr. Pomeroy insisted they come up with a budget for the new firm and estimate how long it might be before they would be able to pay themselves. The best case was two months. Mr. Pomeroy said lawyers going out on their own should be able to last a minimum of three months, but preferably six, without a paycheck.
When Serena Minott started Minott Gore in Miami in 2007 with a fellow large-firm refugee, Keesonga Gore, she found that without a partner telling her what to do and when to do it, time management was difficult. Now, she reserves Monday through Wednesday for client work and Thursday and Friday for business development. ''I also keep a daily to-do list with the top three to four things that must get finished that day,'' she said. ''I don't leave until those are finished, and then I can run a couple of errands and have lunch. I've learned that once you leave the office, it's hard to regain focus.''
In 2010, Cynthia Gilbert, an intellectual property, or I.P., lawyer, left Choate Hall & Stewart and started Hyperion Law in Boston. She wanted to work with small companies. ''If you're a billion-dollar company, you have probably figured out your I.P. strategy,'' she said. ''Smaller companies don't have the resources to hire a high-powered attorney to help with that.'' At Choate, Ms. Gilbert tried to bring in small clients, but her 2,000 hours a year billing requirement left little time for business development.
After leaving, Ms. Gilbert spent the next seven months networking, ''going from coffee to coffee to lunch and then dinner, meeting anyone interested in having a conversation about opportunities for small businesses.'' She was able to manage financially during this period by using some savings, doing contract work for other lawyers and working for two former Choate clients.
Now she is learning to handle uncertainty. ''Some months you do amazingly well,'' she said, ''and then for several months you're slow. You have to stick it out and handle the anxiety. By the end of my first six months, I could see the ebbs and flows. I'm calmer about it now because I know it's cyclical -- it's not that I'm failing.''

HEADLINE: Egypt's Unfinished Revolution

 BODY:
More than 100,000 Egyptians did not risk their lives in Tahrir Square last winter just to see another military-backed tyranny. Military leaders -- supposedly only running things until civilians can be elected -- have used the nine months since they helped oust Hosni Mubarak to try to stifle democratic change and protect their own power. 
Egyptians are rightly fed up, and they are back in Tahrir Square demanding real democracy. At least 38 protestors have been killed, hundreds hurt, scores arrested.
The system the army set up meant Egypt would not have an elected president in charge before 2013. On Tuesday, the generals offered to move the presidential vote up to next June. But that would leave the army in overall control through the middle of next year. That is too long.
The United States has a clear interest in a stable democratic Egypt, at peace with Israel and its Arab neighbors. The $2 billion in annual aid it provides -- two-thirds of it to Egypt's military -- means it has considerable potential leverage. It needs to press the military a lot harder to deliver a swift and stable transition to democracy.
The voting for a new Parliament is scheduled to begin on Monday. Given all of the unrest, and the army-imposed constraints, a free and fair process is by no means assured. But the last thing Egypt needs is further delay. The vote should proceed, and the international community should warn the generals that they will pay a high price if they try to corrupt or hijack the outcome.
The generals will claim that they are protecting Egypt from chaos. Their real concern seems to be protecting their prerogatives, including control of lucrative chunks of the economy. Their brutal and clumsy efforts to do so ensure greater instability. The only way to retrieve some of the army's lost esteem is to observe strict political neutrality while speeding its exit from power.
The Muslim Brotherhood is now Egypt's best organized political movement, and, with the voting ground rules already tilted in its favor, an almost certain big winner in first round of parliamentary elections. But its efforts to protect that advantage by cutting a deal with the military touched off popular anger, and it is now trying to backpedal. Egyptians are back in Tahrir Square because they want real democracy. They are entitled to nothing less.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Fall, and Jobless Claims Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Business orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell for a second consecutive month in October, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.
While much of the weakness in durable goods orders came from a big drop in demand for commercial aircraft, a critical category that tracks business investment spending fell by the largest amount since January.
In other economic reports Wednesday, the government said that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to 393,000 last week, slightly more than economists had expected. 
In addition, consumer spending increased 0.1 percent last month, below expectations and the weakest gain in four months. Incomes, however, were up 0.4 percent, which was slightly better than expected.
The overall decline in orders for durable goods was 0.7 percent, following a September decline of 1.5 percent. Orders for core capital goods, considered a good proxy for business investment spending, dropped 1.8 percent, the biggest decline since a 4.8 percent fall in January.
Manufacturing has been one of the strongest sectors in the economy in this subpar recovery, but the sector slowed this year as consumer demand faltered and auto factories had trouble getting parts after the natural disasters in Japan last March.
The October drop in core capital goods -- nonmilitary products excluding aircraft -- was expected to be a temporary setback. This category has been surging this year, spurred by tax breaks that are allowing companies to write off their investments all in one year as long as the purchases are made before the end of 2011. That has provoked a rush by companies to take advantage of this tax break, which Congress passed in an effort to spur the economy.
For October, orders for transportation products fell 4.8 percent, reflecting a 16.4 percent drop in demand for commercial planes. Orders for autos showed a solid 6.2 percent increase, reflecting solid sales gains in recent months.
Excluding transportation, durable goods orders posted a 0.7 percent increase. This gain reflected increases in areas like primary metals such as steel and heavy machinery.
The small increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance -- up 2,000 from the previous week -- came after two months of steady declines. The four-week average of applications, which smooths week-to-week fluctuations, fell to its lowest level since April, the Labor Department said.
The downward trend suggested companies are laying off fewer workers.
In the report on consumer spending, the Commerce Department said purchases of durable goods like autos showed a solid increase. But spending on nondurable goods, like food and clothing, fell.
The 0.4 percent increase in incomes in October was the best showing since March. Private wages and salaries drove the gain. The solid increase followed five consecutive months of weak income gains. And subtracting taxes and adjusting for inflation, income rose 0.3 percent in October.
Many Americans chose to save the extra money. The savings rate ticked up to 3.5 percent of after-tax incomes, up from 3.3 percent in September -- the lowest level since December 2007, the month the recession started.
The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index grew more slowly in October than September but still remained at a level indicating manufacturing was continuing to expand. Manufacturing, one of the first sectors to start growing after the recession officially ended in June 2009, has posted growth for 27 consecutive months, according to the ISM index.
Also, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell to 64.1 from 64.2 in the preliminary November report, according to a report released on Wednesday. Economists in a Reuters survey expected a final November sentiment index reading of 64.5.

HEADLINE: For Locked-Out Players, Openings Overseas

BYLINE: By JAKE APPLEMAN

 BODY:
MADRID -- Last Sunday, the day Spain held elections, thousands in the Spanish capital chose to watch live professional basketball, something still unavailable in the United States.
Rampant politicking between the N.B.A.'s owners and players mirrored the bickering between Spain's left-wing and right-wing political parties. At the end of the day, the conservative Mariano Rajoy was elected Spain's prime minister in part because economic turbulence was cause for systemic change.
Sound familiar? There are issues with the system in the N.B.A., too, which is why the two sides have been unable to resolve a lockout that, as of Thanksgiving, has lasted 147 days. The union has dissolved itself. Players have filed antitrust lawsuits. Games are already canceled through Dec. 15.
For the first time, an N.B.A. season could be completely lost, although talks quietly resumed on Tuesday, with a Christmas Day opener still the lure to get a deal done somehow, some way, by the end of the weekend. 
For the moment, though, migration, mostly to Europe and China, has been the answer for some out-of-work players. According to a comprehensive but frequently in flux list on HoopsHype.com, 63 players who had N.B.A. contracts last season are currently abroad or have agreed to play abroad.
''I talk to my American agent, and everyone wants a job, wants to try and come over and play,'' said Real Madrid's American sharpshooter, Jaycee Carroll, a Wyoming native who has risen through the ranks of the Spanish league after starring at Utah State. ''A lot of them don't have any idea what they're getting into, but that's part of coming over.''
And what are they getting into? Carroll elaborated: ''I'll call my family from home and I'll be like: 'Hey, I'm in Serbia. What am I doing out here in Serbia?' Whoever thought coming from Evanston, Wyo., I'd ever be in Belgium, Serbia or Spain, for that matter?''
Then again, whoever thought that instead of an N.B.A. season, Kevin Love and Luol Deng would entertain the idea of joining Deron Williams on the Besiktas team in Turkey (Love ended up rejecting an offer) or that Dirk Nowitzki, according to ESPN, would weigh several offers in his native Germany while pondering the idea of playing for a big Spanish team like Real Madrid.
Pau and Marc Gasol have said they would like to play for their former club, Barcelona, if the season is canceled, and recent rumors had Kevin Durant considering playing in Spain, Israel or Germany. Even Dwyane Wade appears interested in playing overseas.
Asked if more players would be trickling over to Europe if the lockout is not resolved, Joey Dorsey, one of four players to spend all of last season in the N.B.A. and play in last Sunday's Madrid doubleheader, responded emphatically.
''Of course,'' he said. ''Of course.''
Players still interested in moving to Europe -- assuming the N.B.A. lockout cannot be overcome in the weeks ahead -- will have to try to find spots on rosters that have already been set, and on teams where finances are often tight.
It may not be easy, although clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona, thanks to their soccer prowess, see themselves as global brands and might be receptive to midseason big-name acquisitions even if they would cause some recalibrating of team chemistry.
Meanwhile, some players who have already moved overseas are finding their way.
Williams of the Nets, the only N.B.A. superstar currently playing in Europe, has adjusted, overcoming a rough start. His Besiktas team had a 12-game winning streak snapped last weekend, and Williams responded with a 50-point performance on Tuesday as Besiktas got back in the victory column.
Andrei Kirilenko of the Utah Jazz and CSKA Moscow has the highest player rating in the prestigious Euroleague, a competition between Europe's best teams. (He recently sustained a concussion and a broken nose in a nasty fall). In fact, in each of the first five weeks of the Euroleague, the most valuable player has been a locked-out N.B.A. player. Kirilenko and Nicolas Batum of the Portland Trail Blazers have won the award twice, while Jordan Farmar, who played with the Nets last year, has won it once.
Kyle Singler, the Detroit Pistons' rookie-in-waiting, is 11th in the Spanish league in scoring for Lucentum Alicante.
Other players have not been so fortunate. While Omri Casspi will return to Maccabi Tel Aviv if the lockout is not resolved, one of the players he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for, J. J. Hickson, could not adapt in Israel and returned home. DaJuan Summers returned to the United States from Italy, DeJuan Blair from Russia and Earl Clark from China.
And last Sunday, the Nuggets' J. R. Smith hurt his knee in a Chinese league game. The injury did not turn out to be as serious as originally thought, but Smith's desire to seek medical attention away from the team landed him in hot water.
There are also those who have used the lockout as a chance to go home. Spurs guard Tony Parker is playing for the team he partly owns in France, ASVEL Villeurbanne. A friend and countryman, Ronny Turiaf of the Knicks, has joined him.
Danilo Gallinari, the former Knick and current Nugget, has returned to Italy to play for his former team, Olympia Milano. Ersan Ilyasova (Bucks) and Mehmet Okur (Jazz) are playing in their native Turkey.
The four N.B.A. players who played in the doubleheader at Palacio de los Deportes (Rudy Fernandez, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Seraphin and Dorsey) largely played well. A fifth, Reggie Williams, nursed a knee injury.
And the two teams with N.B.A. players won. Real Madrid defeated Lagun Aro, 82-74, in the early afternoon, and visiting powerhouse Caja Laboral beat Estudiantes, 74-54, in the nightcap.
Ibaka, the Oklahoma City Thunder big man, recently signed a two-month contract with Real Madrid and is still working his way into the rotation, although both he and Seraphin (Washington Wizards/Caja Laboral) showcased a remarkable athleticism that is not all that common in the Spanish league.
''My adaptation is getting better every day,'' Ibaka said. ''It's better to play than just to stay at home. You can't just keep working every day. You need to play, too.''
Meanwhile, despite shooting 2 of 11 from the floor, Fernandez, the former Portland Trail Blazer acquired by the Dallas Mavericks on draft day, led Real Madrid to victory by doing everything else. He dished out six assists, collected four steals and sank all nine of his free throws.
And the public address announcer effusively rolled the ''R'' in Rudy.

HEADLINE: How to End the Black Friday Madness

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank, a professor of economics at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell, is the author of ''The Darwin Economy: Liberty, Competition and the Common Good.''

 BODY:
Ithaca, N.Y.
ADAM SMITH'S most enthusiastic modern disciples insist that the recipe for economic progress is to push government aside and let unfettered markets work their magic. His invisible hand theory does provide a tidy account of how market incentives can generate enormous wealth. But as Charles Darwin saw so clearly, unbridled competition doesn't always promote the common good.
It's not how fast or how strong you are that matters, but whether you're faster or stronger than your closest rivals. The arms races that result when rivals jockey for position -- witness the huge antlers of bull elk -- often spawn considerable waste. And as with the elk, so, too, in the marketplace. The start time for post-Thanksgiving sales is a vivid case in point. 
In recent years, large retail chains have been competing to be the first to open their doors on Black Friday. The race is driven by the theory that stores with the earliest start time capture the most buyers and make the most sales. For many years, stores opened at a reasonable hour. Then, some started opening at 5 a.m., prompting complaints from employees about having to go to sleep early on Thanksgiving and miss out on time with their families. But retailers ignored those complaints, because their earlier start time proved so successful in luring customers away from rival outlets.
Those rivals, of course, didn't sit idly by. Their inevitable response was to open earlier themselves, restoring competitive balance. Other retailers began opening at 4 a.m., then 3 a.m., and, eventually, at midnight. Several malls have promoted ''Moonlight Madness.'' Last year Toys ''R'' Us opened at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving. This year, Wal-Mart will do the same. The costs to store owners and their employees and families are enormous: millions must now spend time away from home on the one occasion that all Americans, regardless of religion or cultural background, share as a family holiday.
These costs might be worth bearing if they led to even larger gains. But when all outlets open earlier, no one benefits. Few people actually want to shop in the wee hours, and the purchases that do occur then are presumably offset, dollar for dollar, by reduced sales during normal business hours. Even the shoppers who turn out for early openings seem motivated primarily by a fear that others might snap up bargains before they get there. But if all stores opened later, there would be no fewer bargains than before. In short, we have a classic collective action problem, an arms race.
Black Friday (or, more accurately, Black Thursday Night) is only hours away, so it's too late to do anything about early openings this year. But we can start thinking about what can be done to protect our future Thanksgivings. Many societies employ ''blue laws'' -- laws that mandate closing times, usually on Sundays. But there is a simpler, more flexible, way to approach this problem. Inspired by the 9-9-9 proposal of the Republican presidential contender Herman Cain, I call it the 6-6-6 plan -- an across-the-board 6 percent national sales tax (on top of any existing state and local sales taxes) in effect from 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving to 6 a.m. on Black Friday.
This plan would leave both stores and consumers free to decide for themselves whether middle-of-the-night shopping is worth it. Even if some retailers decided to stick with the early openings and even if some shoppers showed up, the country would reap a significant benefit. As every mature adult realizes, we have to tax something, and the revenue from my 6-6-6 plan would make it possible to reduce taxes on other activities that are actually useful. Best of all, it would encourage Americans to spend Thanksgiving night where they really want to -- in bed.

HEADLINE: Torture Used On Protesters In Bahrain, Report Says

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI; Anthony Shadid contributed reporting from Cairo, and Mark Landler from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Security forces in Bahrain used excessive force, including torture and the extraction of forced confessions, against detainees who were arrested in a sweeping crackdown early this year during protests that deeply polarized the country, according to a report by an independent commission that investigated the uprising and its aftermath.
The report, released on Wednesday, presented a devastating portrait of what it called disproportionate and indiscriminate force often used by the security forces to repress protests in February and March that were organized primarily by the Shiite Muslim majority in Bahrain, a tiny Persian Gulf state that is a prominent American ally.
''A number of detainees were tortured,'' M. Cherif Bassiouni, an international law expert who led the inquiry, said at a news conference in Manama, the capital, as King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa listened. Mr. Bassiouni added that the dimensions of the torture ''proved there was a deliberate practice by some.'' 
The protesters began by calling for a more equitable political system, including a constitutional monarchy. But as the violence escalated, some demonstrators demanded the dismantling of the political structure, and the Sunni monarchy at times appeared to fear that the family that had conquered Bahrain in the 18th century was about to be overthrown.
The report by the panel, known as the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, also said there was no clear evidence that Iran had incited the unrest, as senior Bahraini officials have contended. And it determined that troops from neighboring Persian Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia, that intervened during the crisis in Bahrain did not violate human rights.
In Washington, the Obama administration welcomed the report, but said the onus was now on Bahrain's government to hold accountable those responsible for abuses and to undertake reforms to make sure they do not occur again.
Based on more than 5,000 interviews with protesters, Bahrain residents and foreigners, the inquiry represents perhaps the most comprehensive look at any of the uprisings and crackdowns that have roiled the Arab world this year. In its sheer breadth -- it runs to 489 pages -- the report appeared to mark a first for the Arab world, pulling the shroud back from the inner workings of secretive security forces.
King Khalifa commissioned the report from an independent panel that he appointed in the summer to investigate the protests and crackdown; all members of the commission are internationally recognized in their fields. The results had been eagerly anticipated by both the nation's Shiites, who represent about 70 percent of the population, and the ruling Sunni minority.
The commission found that Bahrain's security services and Interior Ministry ''followed a systematic practice of physical and psychological mistreatment, which amounted in many cases to torture, with respect to a large number of detainees.''
In the report, the panel called the government's use of force and firearms excessive and, ''on many occasions, unnecessary, disproportionate and indiscriminate.'' It cited instances in which masked men broke into the homes of dissidents between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., ''terrorizing'' inhabitants.
The inquiry determined that 35 people died during the protests, including five security personnel. Five detainees were tortured to death while in custody, the panel concluded, and other detainees endured electric shocks and were beaten with rubber hoses and wires. Hundreds of people were also injured.
A total of 2,929 people were arrested during the protests, the report said, and at least 700 remain in prison. The commission urged a review of the sentences handed down to protesters.
The commission also determined that Shiites were not the only victims of violence and intimidation: it said that Sunni Muslims were targets for humiliation, physical assaults and attacks against their property.
The king, speaking during the televised news conference, said that officials who engaged in abuses during the crackdown would be held accountable and replaced. He pointedly cited wrongs, although he portrayed them as having been committed by both sides.
And despite the commission's conclusion that Iran did not play a role in the uprising, the king again insisted that Iran, a Shiite majority nation, had incited the unrest in Bahrain.
Still, he pledged to heed the report's findings. ''We do not tolerate the mistreatment of detainees and prisoners,'' King Khalifa said. ''We are dismayed to find that it has occurred, as your report has found. We must reform our laws to bring them in line with international standards.''
Of all the uprisings in the Arab world, Bahrain managed to end the unrest, largely by using coercive force. Tensions between Sunnis and Shiites flared, and a country that was once one of the region's most cosmopolitan is now one of its most divided.
Aides to the king had hoped the commission's report would offer a starting point for reconciliation, but the opposition, which in recent weeks had indicated skepticism about the inquiry, said the report fell short.
''The report did not say the truth,'' said Ali al-Aswad, a member of the Al-Wefaq party, the biggest legal opposition group, and a former lawmaker. ''It did not say who was responsible for killing protesters and firing people from their jobs and universities and causing people to lose their homes. It failed to point the finger at senior officials.''
But Al-Wefaq was more measured in an official statement, saying that the report ''confirmed systematic, serious and deliberate violations.'' It called for a ''national salvation government,'' though the prospect of such a step appeared unlikely.
A statement issued by the government stressed that the commission did not find that the abuses were a result of an official policy. ''The report does not confirm that there was a government policy of torture, mistreatment or using excessive force,'' the statement said.
The opposition has insisted that the repression was in fact systematic, part of what it calls institutional discrimination against the Shiite majority. Although the report stopped short of naming names -- as the opposition had demanded -- it did say that the abuse of detainees originated at the highest levels of Bahrain's security institutions.
''The very fact that a systematic pattern of behavior existed indicates that this is how these security forces were trained and how they were expected to act,'' the report said. ''This could not have happened without the knowledge of higher echelons of the command structure'' of the Interior Ministry and National Security Agency.
The government said in its statement that Bahrain accepted the commission's criticisms.
''We took the initiative in asking for this thorough and detailed inquiry to seek the truth, and we accept it,'' the government said.
The government also said it would create a committee to study the commission's findings and enact its recommendations. The release of the commission's report capped a contentious process, during which Mr. Bassiouni's comments to journalists often incited anger among the Shiite-led opposition. Mr. Bassiouni, in a view echoed by American officials, had hoped the report would empower government officials who are perceived as more moderate. But the outcome will depend in large part on the strength of the resistance to the report's recommendations within the ruling family.
The panel was not asked to take up political questions, and so its report was cautious in offering ways to address the Bahraini Shiites' sense of disenfranchisement.
The commission did recommend that Bahrain develop ''a national reconciliation program that addresses the grievances of groups which are, or perceive themselves to be, deprived of equal political, social and economic rights and benefits.''
In a grim reminder of the divisions that still beset Bahrain, the police clashed with protesters on Wednesday in at least two Shiite villages hours before the report was released. Activists said at least two people were killed in the violence. Residents and activists also said the security forces used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the protesters.
Hundreds of men and women chanted ''Hamad must fall'' during the demonstrations, the residents and activists said.

HEADLINE: In This Town, Turkey Picks Up Bill for Dinner

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
OZARK, Ark. -- Brenda Farmer and Willie Blanscet have sat across from each other on the Butterball bagging line for 17 years, 102 cold, raw turkeys sliding by in front of them every minute.
''Me and Willie look at each other and say, 'How in the world can anybody eat this much turkey?' '' Mrs. Farmer said.
For $11.40 an hour, the women, both in their 60s, cull the good from the bad.
The ones that are not bruised or missing a leg move down the line to be injected with brine, stuffed with a neck and a packet of giblets, then bagged and sent out into the world, where they land on holiday tables all over America. 
The odds are good that yours may be one. The women, along with workers at another Butterball plant a 90-minute drive away, help produce about a third of the 43 million turkeys the nation will eat today, according to the National Turkey Federation.
This corner of northwest Arkansas is not the land of free-running heritage birds that command $16 a pound. A leisurely morning browsing the farmers' market is not how most people spend a Saturday.
In this community of 3,000 on the Arkansas River, where everyone is cheering on the Hillbillies, the high school football team that made it to the state playoffs, turkey is an industry. And a job at the Butterball plant is one of the most reliable in town.
The median income in Franklin County is just over $30,000 a year. Unemployment is at 7.3 percent. Every week, a dozen or so people show up at the plant looking for work. Maybe two get hired, plant managers said.
It is not easy work. Turkeys need to be stunned and dispatched and gutted. Someone has to cut the oil gland out of the tail. Necks and gizzards and livers have to be cleaned and stuffed into a cavity. During a six-week period that begins in October, the line runs seven days a week to process fresh turkey. It is a period people in town simply refer to as ''fresh,'' and it is grueling.
''It's a long battle when we're working fresh, but I at least got some bills paid and Christmas money,'' Mrs. Farmer said. ''I just sit there and hum and sing and talk to my friend Willie. We get through it together.''
The millionth bird of the season rolled off the line in early November. The company managers made a little ceremony of it, taking photos of the workers along the line who helped process it. They gave the bird to a local World War II veteran, who got his picture in The Spectator, the local paper.
Other than a Baptist church sign that reads, ''God will welcome even the biggest turkey,'' a turkey giveaway organized by local merchants and some white feathers floating near the plant, there is not much indication that this town runs on turkey. There is no bronze turkey statue in the small town square, no Little Miss Turkey parade on the main street. Still, almost everyone works at the plant or knows someone who has. People who are new to town often end up there. Some stay for 40 years or more, and some leave as fast as they can.
Marty Taylor, 41, the local barber, spent a summer bagging turkeys. He was grateful he was not on the ''vis line'' -- where turkeys get cleaned of their viscera. Still, it was enough to send him to barber school.
''It's a job you get if you can't get a job anywhere else,'' he said.
The concerns that come with large-scale food production -- among them pathogen contamination, worker safety, antibiotic use and animal welfare -- are not often part of the conversation in Ozark.
People would rather talk about hunting, which is so popular that photos of children in camouflage holding their first deer take up an entire page in The Spectator.
That is not to say the Butterball corporation, which took over the plant from Cargill in 2006, does not have to confront such issues. The recall of more than 36 million pounds of ground turkey in August and September from a nearby Cargill plant was a good reminder that one slip in sanitation standards can have monumental effects.
And every Thanksgiving, the company is pelted with calls and e-mail messages regarding animal welfare.
The company still bears the scars from a 2006 undercover operation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which secretly recorded workers stomping and throwing turkeys so violently that it prompted an investigation by the United States Department of Agriculture.
There is also a class-action suit pending by workers who want to get paid for the time it takes them to suit up for work and sterilize equipment.
The violence was an anomaly, Butterball officials say. And they point to the benefits, solid wages and clear record of worker safety at the plant. They are proud of the quality of their birds. They even pull one off the line every day and roast it, just to make sure it tastes good.
''Just because we're big doesn't mean we are evil,'' said Alice Johnson, a vice president in charge of food safety and government affairs. ''We realize we are feeding families here.''
Ozark's turkey farmers are not immune to the issues that are hurting farm communities everywhere. The cost of fuel and corn -- much of which is getting diverted to make ethanol -- makes it hard for the people who grow the turkeys to make a living.
Butterball growers, whose 90 farms are laced throughout the countryside here, work under contracts with the company. Every two or three months, a load of baby turkeys gets dropped off.
The company provides the feed, regulates how the birds should be raised and provides veterinary care. The farmer provides the long, low turkey houses and tends to the birds. When the hens are about 14 pounds and the toms about 22, a crew from Butterball comes in at night (turkeys are calmer at night) and hauls them off to the plant.
After accounting for the costs of raising the birds and their size, the farmer gets a check.
Lately, the company cannot find enough farmers, in part because banks are not as willing to lend money to build turkey operations.
For some, a turkey contract is no longer as attractive as it once was.
Joshua Freeman, 34, recently lost a race for mayor. He is in the bar business, in part because turkey farming did not pay enough. His father got out of the business after 15 years, he said, because Butterball kept requiring improvements just as the family got close to paying everything off and realizing profits.
''It was like working for the company store,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''You could never get ahead.''
He and others in town talk about ways to expand the economic base beyond turkey and the local Baldor Electric Company small-engine plant.
Maybe, some say, the town can land a local bottling company to get business from the wineries and microbreweries that are popping up in the Ozarks.
The economy is still bad here, but things are looking up. A new dollar store is going to open. So is a new dental clinic. And everyone is proud of the Arkansas Tech University campus in town.
But for Mrs. Farmer and Ms. Blanscet, it has always been and will always be about work at the turkey plant.
They pass the time talking about the weather and grandchildren and the stuff of life. Ms. Blanscet's son is coping with cancer. Mrs. Farmer celebrated her 60th birthday with a trip to a nearby casino for a buffet and a few turns at the slot machine.
Like every other Butterball employee, they will each get a free frozen turkey for Thanksgiving. It will be given to relatives.
''You look at it every day, and you get to where you don't really care for turkey,'' Mrs. Farmer said. ''That's why I get a ham.''

PERSON: Eli Hurvitz 

HEADLINE: Eli Hurvitz, 79; Built a Generic-Drug Giant

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Eli Hurvitz, who began his career washing lab equipment at a drug company and went on to build Teva Pharmaceutical Industries into the largest generic drug maker in the world, died on Monday night. He was 79. 
His death was announced by Teva. No cause was given, but in an interview with the newspaper Yediot Aharonot earlier this year he said he had cancer. ''I am not the type to surrender,'' he told the paper. ''That is how it was in business, and that is how it is with the illness.''
Mr. Hurvitz started out in the 1950s at Assia, a small pharmaceutical company partly owned by his father-in-law, in Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv. He became managing director in 1976 and merged Assia with two other small firms, Zori and Teva, to form the company now known as Teva, which means ''nature'' in Hebrew. Mr. Hurvitz was the president and chief executive of Teva for the next 25 years.
Through aggressive mergers and acquisitions, a reputation for quality and low prices, Teva grew into a giant that supplied one of every six prescriptions dispensed in the United States. It has a presence in 60 countries and 45,000 employees. In 2010, it manufactured 63 billion tablets and reached $16 billion in sales.
After moving into branded drugs, Teva had a market breakthrough in the 1990s with the introduction of Copaxone, a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. Developed with researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, it became the first original Israeli drug to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.
Mr. Hurvitz stepped down as chief executive in 2002 and became chairman until 2010, when he retired.
Eliyahu Hurvitz was born in Jerusalem in 1932, when the country, then known as Palestine, was under British control. He moved to Tel Aviv with his family as a child. When the state of Israel was founded and the Arab-Israeli war broke out in 1948, Mr. Hurvitz was drafted and spent time on a kibbutz as part of a unit that established agricultural settlements.
He went on to study economics at a branch of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Tel Aviv. In 1953, he married Dalia Solomon and began working at Assia.
Mr. Hurvitz was awarded the Israel Prize in 2002 for lifetime achievement and his contributions to the state and society. Outside of his business he had been chairman of Bank Leumi, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel and chairman of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research institute in Jerusalem.
In a statement, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, called Mr. Hurvitz one of the country's great industrialists. ''Israeli initiative and the Israeli spirit had no better ambassador,'' he said.
The current president and chief of Teva, Shlomo Yanai, said Mr. Hurvitz's ''vision of providing access to affordable medicine has helped improve the lives of people around the world.''
Mr. Hurvitz is survived by his wife; three children, Vered, Dafna and Haim; and nine grandchildren.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Counting Really Small Blessings

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
This year I am giving thanks for the Republican presidential debates.
Didn't see that one coming, did you?
I have a real tolerance for boring television, having watched at least two series now on the air about people who bid on abandoned storage lockers, as well as several segments of the show about extreme coupon-collecting. So the debates are right up my alley. After the 10th or 11th episode, you get a feeling of up-close interaction previously reserved for people who live in Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters are so entitled that they find it hard to support anybody who hasn't been to the house for dinner, or possibly a sleepover.
You come to know everybody's special gimmicks. Newt Gingrich will say something snotty to the moderators to show he hates the news media. Whenever Rick Perry gets lost in the verbal weeds, he has taken to demanding that Congress be made part time. Michele Bachmann points out that she's had 23 foster children. Mitt Romney's special thing is to swear that, unlike President Obama, he will not apologize for the United States. Which Obama never did. 
Meanwhile, Romney's campaign was running an ad in New Hampshire that purported to show Obama in 2008, saying: ''If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.'' Which was actually Obama quoting John McCain's campaign. Romney has a long and well-documented history of changing his positions. This time around, he is apparently also planning to just make things up.
But about the debates. My favorite this week was the Thanksgiving Family Forum, in which everybody in the race who isn't a Mormon went to Iowa to compete for the love of the Christian right. This was the one in which Rick Perry assured the audience that because of his strong anti-abortion stance he would immediately end the policy of sending China ''billions of dollars'' in American foreign aid.
Who knew? Truly, it was the most interesting TV moment since I watched somebody bid way too much money for an abandoned storage locker containing fake leather furniture and a portrait of cats with big eyes.
The CNN national security debate had fewer cheap thrills, although it was fun hearing Herman Cain call Wolf Blitzer ''Blitz.'' Also there was Michele Bachmann's description of her role in the debt-ceiling crisis. (''And my voice said this: I said it's time for us to draw a line in the sand.'') It seemed to suggest she had come to see herself in the third person. Or maybe as an oracle. Or a ventriloquist.
These are the moments that get you through the long, hard periods where everybody but Ron Paul is competing to see who can promise to do the toughest things to Iran. (Let Israel bomb them! Bomb them ourselves! Let's assassinate some nuclear scientists!)
This week's biggest drama was the Newt Has a Heart Moment, when Gingrich said he believed an undocumented immigrant who had ''been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, you belong to a local church'' should be given some avenue to legal status. Bachmann instantly and repeatedly claimed Newt was talking about ''11 million people,'' which sounds like one heck of a lot of 25-year-resident grandparents.
''Amnesty is a magnet,'' said Romney, who has spent two presidential campaigns branding his opponents as amnesty-givers.
You could see Perry's face light up. This was so clearly his moment to point out that Mitt Romney used to have illegal immigrants mowing his lawn.
''Here we go again, Mitt. You and I, standing by each other again, and you used the words about the magnets,'' Perry started. But you could almost hear the alarms going off. The candidates have been urged/bullied/blackmailed into avoiding personal attacks on one another.
''And that's one of the things that we obviously have to do, is to stop those magnets of -- for individuals to come in here,'' Perry concluded, retreating fast. Nobody even noticed, since he talks like that even when he is saying what he intended to say.
This is totally unfair to the loyal debate watchers. I guess now there's no chance anybody will ask Romney about the day he drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.
On the plus side, there was the moment at the Family Forum when Rick Santorum explained how God had arranged his come-from-behind win of a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania. ''And I really felt blessed that I knew at that moment, when I won, I had a constituency of One,'' he burbled.
Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster who served as moderator, asked Santorum what message God was sending when he then lost the seat -- by what I believe was 17 percentage points.
Santorum was momentarily silenced. Really thankful for that.

HEADLINE: Romney Defends Ad Aimed at Obama

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Mitt Romney on Wednesday defended his campaign's first television commercial, which takes President Obama's words out of context over his handling of the economy, gleefully telling reporters, ''We obviously got under their skin.'' 
On a campaign visit to Iowa, Mr. Romney used a Thanksgiving analogy to push back against a torrent of criticism from Democrats and independent fact-checkers who said the advertisement distorted Mr. Obama's comments from the 2008 campaign when he said, ''If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.''
At the time, Mr. Obama was quoting a statement that his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, had made on the economy. But that point was not included in the Romney ad that is showing this week in New Hampshire.
The commercial was judged by PolitiFact, a nonpartisan campaign watchdog, as ''ridiculously misleading.'' The president's re-election campaign and Democrats called it deceitful and dishonest.
Mr. Romney, who has sharpened his tone against Mr. Obama recently and pledged to ''take it to them, day in and day out,'' disagreed.
''There was no hidden effort on the part of our campaign,'' he said. ''It was instead to point out that what's sauce for the goose is now sauce for the gander.''
As a puzzled look fell over a few reporters, Mr. Romney added: ''This ad points out that, guess what? It's now your turn. The same lines that you used on John McCain are now going to be used on you.''

HEADLINE: Spotlight Back on Kerry, but Reshaped Role Eludes Him

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A feverish scrum of reporters was in such pursuit of Senator John Kerry last Friday that he was chased all the way from a Senate meeting room to the subway under the Capitol, where in the chaos a blizzard of secret papers from debt reduction talks went flying from his arms. It was an inelegant moment, particularly for a onetime Democratic nominee for president, but Mr. Kerry stooped down and gathered up his own documents before he made an escape.
''It's a tough negotiation,'' he said gloomily as a subway car carried him away from talks that were in as much disarray as his papers.
This week the nation learned just how tough as the bipartisan panel tasked with deficit reduction announced its failure, triggering $1.2 trillion in automatic budget cuts over the next decade and enough recriminations to last through next year's presidential election. For Mr. Kerry, an American foreign policy elder and an unlikely member of a panel that delved into the minutiae of federal finances, the breakdown deprives him of a role he sought, a domestic policy statesman as comfortable with tax codes as statecraft. 
A victory would have burnished, or so the Washington wisdom went, his resume for secretary of state, should there be an Obama second term.
''Who in God's name thought that?'' Mr. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked in an interview in his Senate office this week, shortly before the failure of the panel became public. ''That's ridiculous. You know, engaging in this kind of thing is not a job interview for anything.''
He joined the so-called super-committee, he said, because he wanted a role in the central issues facing the country, reviving the economy and creating jobs.
''I thought it was important to be in the fight rather than on the sidelines,'' said Mr. Kerry, who for years toiled in the domestic policy shadow of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, his senior state colleague. He blamed Republicans for the panel's failure, saying they refused to yield on a no-new-taxes pledge, just as Republicans blamed the Democrats for inflexibility on money-saving changes to programs like Medicare and Social Security.
Republicans also singled out Mr. Kerry for what one called a ''rogue'' effort on Monday to make a deal on taxes (Mr. Kerry said it was his best last-ditch try), and for talking a lot, an infamous Kerry characteristic, during panel meetings -- something noted on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' last week. ''Of course he's talking too much!'' Mr. Stewart bellowed. ''That's his super power!''
The senator, who missed the show, made light of it later. ''Well, if you're pushing to get something done,'' he said in the interview, ''you have to talk, right?''
Mr. Kerry does in many ways appear changed from the presidential candidate of 2004, when he exasperated his party as stiff, slow to respond to President George W. Bush's attacks and trapped in his own labyrinth of words. For a few hours on Election Day, exit polls indicated that Mr. Kerry would be the victor, but he needed 59,000 voters to go his way in Ohio (he lost by more than three million votes nationwide) and returned to the Senate tagged with the reputation of a liberal, highly partisan loner. He was largely missing from major action on Capitol Hill for the next few years.
Mr. Kerry, 67, disputes that narrative by saying that he was busy as the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, but that few paid attention. ''I wasn't going to sit around and mope,'' he said. Still, he acknowledges how difficult it was to come back.
''I was 59,000 votes and one state from being able to put an agenda in front of the country,'' he said. ''And you know for three or four hours we thought it was done.'' So, he said, ''you go from that expectation of beginning to think about what you're going to say to the country to suddenly coming back to the Senate and having to sort of walk a careful line, and not being the nominee, and no pretense about leadership.''
There is no argument that things changed when Mr. Kerry became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee after Senator Joseph R. Biden left the position to be vice president in early 2009. Mr. Kerry was further thrust into prominence when he became his state's senior senator upon the death of Mr. Kennedy the same year. By then Mr. Kerry, who had a lackluster history as a legislator and was known more for conducting Senate inquiries, had gone to work negotiating with Republicans on the new Start arms control treaty, which was successful, and a major climate change bill, which was not.
Although President Obama had passed over Mr. Kerry for secretary of state in favor of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Kerry became a roving diplomat and trouble-shooter for the Obama administration in Sudan, Pakistan and Afghanistan, among other countries. When he was not overseas, his colleagues noticed him around more in the Senate.
During the three months of debt reduction talks, Mr. Kerry reached out a number of times to the Republicans on the panel. He went on long weekend bike rides with Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and had Mr. Portman, other Republicans and Democrats over to his house in Georgetown for a dinner of roast chicken, mashed potatoes and peas. Although Mr. Kerry argued intensely with a pivotal Republican on the panel, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, he insisted their relationship was basically good.
''Kyl and I sparred,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''but Kyl and I have gotten to know each other pretty well, through the Start agreement and now this, and I have respect for his intellectual ability, and he's dogged. He believes what he believes. You can't personalize it. Everybody came with a point of view.''
After Thanksgiving -- Mr. Kerry said he would make his mother's chestnut and sausage stuffing for himself and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry -- the senator still intends to pursue deficit reduction, he said, and to try to hammer out a deal in Congress, however unlikely. He also plans to resume work on the Foreign Relations Committee, which he largely set aside since signing up for the debt panel in the summer. Next month he is to meet in Cairo with Egypt's military rulers, students and aspiring politicians.
''What they're wrestling with right now is how much power to put in the hands of a new prime minister, to try to meet the needs of the people on the ground,'' Mr. Kerry said of Egypt's turmoil. ''It's almost the second phase of a revolution.''
In the meantime, he fends off suggestions that he is auditioning to be secretary of state once Mrs. Clinton steps down, as she has said she will at the end of Mr. Obama's term. ''I'm very happy with what I'm doing,'' Mr. Kerry said.
Online Correction: November 24, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect middle initial for the vice president. He is Joseph R. Biden, not Joseph I.

HEADLINE: The Apocalypse Trade

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Follow the bouncing bund. 

 BODY:
I really wasn't planning on blogging on Thanksgiving Day. But what's going on in Europe deserves a mention.
So, the big story: German bonds are now being priced as a risky asset -- what the FT calls the "apocalypse trade". The interest rate on bunds, at 2.21% as I write this, is still very low by historical standards. But it's above the rate on UK bonds (2.17%) and way above the rate on US bonds (1.88%).
The way to see this is that the market is in effect pricing in a real possibility of eurozone collapse.
In particular, market expectations seem to assume that the ECB will remain utterly indifferent to its responsibilities. The German breakeven rate, an implicit forecast of inflation over the next 5 years, is just 1 percent. That's a disaster level, implying severe deflation in the debtor nations -- or, more likely, a euro breakup.
Awesome all around.

HEADLINE: Measuring Financial Contagion

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Banks must be transparent to the regulators and to the public, and if their complexity makes this difficult, they should be made smaller and simpler, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
In an interview with The New York Times in July, Sheila Bair, the departing chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said of her experience over the last few years: "They would say, 'You have to do this, or the system will go down.' If I heard that once, I heard it a thousand times."
No responsible official wants the entire financial system to crash; this would be incredibly disruptive to all Americans and potentially lead to a worldwide depression. Knowing this, many people who want bailouts on generous terms use "contagion fear" as part of their sales pitch.
How are we to know if a particular event, like deciding not to bail out a big bank, will lead to contagion that spreads to other financial markets? Contagion is the key issue.
In Europe, the failure of just one large bank can do macroeconomic damage; governments there have let individual banks build balance sheets that are bigger than the country's gross domestic product. In the United States, we too should fear megabanks; the big six bank-holding companies have become much bigger in recent years and now have combined assets worth more than 65 percent of G.D.P. 
But even the biggest (currently JPMorgan Chase) has a balance sheet of just under $2.3 trillion, while our G.D.P. is around $14 trillion. (Each of the top 10 global banks is around the $2 trillion mark, according to the latest available data from The Banker, but they are based in countries of very different sizes. Be careful in using these numbers as accounting conventions for banks may vary - in particular, derivative exposures are arguably understated in United States banks' published accounts relative to European banks.)
If JPMorgan Chase were in trouble - a completely hypothetical scenario - and its creditors faced, for example, 40 percent losses, this would be very bad news (40 percent is an arbitrary number often used as a baseline by creditors thinking about potentially distressed situations; it looks as though creditors to Lehman Brothers will, on average, end up losing a good deal more of their exposure). 
JPMorgan Chase is mostly financed with debt because, alone among modern executives, bankers do not believe in much equity financing for their businesses. So the financial losses to debt holders could be on the order of $1 trillion.
That would be enough to bring on a serious recession. But it might not, by itself, bring the world economy to its knees.
The case for arguing that JPMorgan Chase is too big to fail rests on the notion that its failure or the prospect of serious losses at that one bank would create fear across a broad range of other assets. Asset price declines could then push other banks into insolvency; we saw some of this in the fall of 2008. There is a potential downward spiral.
One response to this is: Let 'em fail. That's tempting, particularly if you think that one set of traumatic failures would teach everyone that, next time, there will be no bailouts.
Experience from the 19th century in America is not particularly encouraging in this regard. There were no bailout mechanisms - the Federal Reserve was not invented until 1913 and the federal government did not have the resources to save the financial system, even if it wanted to.
Nevertheless, the United States experienced serious banking panics at regular intervals throughout the century, sometimes due to disruptions beyond the control of bankers but often due to the overextension of credit. Banks in those days had to hold "specie" (gold and silver coin), which was generally payable on demand when people wanted to redeem their bank notes (which were issued by private banks, not the government, before the Civil War).
 "Suspensions" of the convertibility for bank notes into specie were disappointingly frequent. During the period 1815-30, according to Davis Rich Dewey's "Financial History of the United States" (see page 155), "Failures of banks were common and bill holders and depositors suffered much." There was a major panic in 1819, and another in 1837, perhaps brought on by the policies of President Andrew Jackson. There was a panic in 1857 in the run-up to the Civil War, and also in 1860 and 1861. 
By some definitions, there were also crises in 1847 and 1866. After the Civil War, "banking disturbances occurred in 1873, 1884, 1890, 1893, and 1907," according to Elmus Wicker in "Banking Panics of the Gilded Age" (see page xiii).
Much of Charles Kindleberger's classic financial history, "Manias, Panics and Crashes" - the title tells you everything - covers the period before central banks operated in their modern form. Various schemes at the state level - and later at the federal level - attempted to control or constrain risk-taking by individual banks, but the unfortunate reality is that the financial lifeblood of American commerce has always been prone to lending too much and incurring heavy losses. 
People see one bank failure and fear the consequences - hence, panics and runs on the bank. Anyone who thinks that we solved this problem with forward-thinking central banks or fiscal interventions has not been paying close attention - either to the United States or to Europe - over the last three years.
We really need transparency on the exact exposures of banks. To whom have they lent and on what basis? Just telling supervisors does not help us at all, because sharing information only behind closed doors is just another potential mechanism for regulatory capture.
For large financial institutions - those with more than $100 billion in total assets - everything should be out in the open. If you want to operate in relative secrecy, stay small. The costs of today's opaqueness are huge, creating the basis for the plea, "Save us or you'll lose the world."
And if the published information is too complex for outsiders to understand, big banks must be forced to simplify their operations until they become sufficiently transparent. Potential contagion risks must be measurable and apparent to the marketplace, including to independent analysts who have access only to public information. 
Needless to say, if any institution poses major contagion risks, as measured on this basis, it should be forced to become safer.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, spoke recently about what he called the "pernicious problem" of too-big-to-fail financial institutions, "in a culture held hostage by concerns for 'contagion,' 'systemic risk' and 'unique solutions'": 
"Invariably, these behemoth institutions use their size, scale and complexity to cow politicians and regulators into believing the world will be placed in peril should they attempt to discipline them. They argue that disciplining them will be a trip wire for financial contagion, market disruption and economic disorder. Yet failing to discipline them only delays the inevitable - a bursting of a bubble and a financial panic that places the economy in peril."
You can only discipline a big troubled bank if you understand and can measure the consequences of its failure.

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Election Day

BYLINE: ROBERT B. REICH


HIGHLIGHT: Can we wrest something good out of the politics of a lost economic decade? 

 BODY:
Most political analysis of America's awful economy focuses on whether it will doom President Obama's reelection or cause Congress to turn toward one party or the other. These are important questions, but we should really be looking at the deeper problems with which whoever wins in 2012 will have to deal.
Not to depress you, but our economic troubles are likely to continue for many years - a decade or more. At the current rate of job growth (averaging 90,000 new jobs per month over the last six months), 14 million Americans will remain permanently unemployed. The consensus estimate is that at least 90,000 new jobs are needed just to keep up with the growth of the labor force. Even if we get back to a normal rate of 200,000 new jobs per month, unemployment will stay high for at least ten years. Years of high unemployment will likely result in a vicious cycle, as relatively lower spending by the middle-class further slows job growth.
This, in turn, could make political compromise even more elusive than it is now, as remarkable as that may seem. In past years, politics has been greased by the expectation of better times to come - not only more personal consumption but also upward mobility through good schools, access to college, better jobs, improved infrastructure. It's been a virtuous cycle: When the economy grows, the wealthy more easily accept a smaller share of the gains because they still came out ahead of where they were before. And everyone more willingly pays taxes to finance public provision because they share in the overall economic gains.
Now the grease is gone. Fully two-thirds of Americans recently polled by the Wall Street Journal say they aren't confident life for their children's generation will be better than it's been for them. The last time our hopes for a better life were dashed so profoundly was during the Great Depression.
But here's what might be considered the good news. Rather than ushering in an era of political paralysis, the Great Depression of the 1930s changed American politics altogether - realigning the major parties, creating new coalitions, and yielding new solutions. Prolonged economic distress of a decade or more could have the same effect this time around.
What might the new politics look like? The nation is polarizing in three distinct ways, and any or all of could generate new political alignments.
Anti-establishment
A vast gulf separates Tea Party Republicans from the inchoate Wall Street Occupiers. The former disdain government; the latter hate Wall Street and big corporations. The Tea Party is well organized and generously financed; Occupiers are relentlessly disorganized and underfunded. And if the events of the last two weeks are any guide, Occupiers probably won't be able to literally occupy public areas indefinitely; they'll have to move from occupying locations to organizing around issues. 
But the two overlap in an important way that provides a clue to the first characteristic of the new politics. Both movements are doggedly anti-establishment - distrusting politically powerful and privileged elites and the institutions those elites inhabit. 
There's little difference, after all, between the right's depiction of a "chablis-drinking, Brie-eating" establishment and the left's perception of a rich one percent who fly to the Hamptons in private jets.
In political terms, both sides are deeply suspicious of the Federal Reserve and want it to be more transparent and accountable. Both are committed to ending "corporate welfare" - special tax breaks and subsidies for specific industries or companies. And for both, Washington's original sin was the bailing out of Wall Street.
Mere mention the bailout at any Tea Party meet-in or Occupier teach-in elicits similar jeers. The first expression of Tea Party power was the Utah Tea Party's rejection of conservative Republican senator Robert Bennett because of his vote for the bailout. At the Republican state convention, which ultimately led to the election of Senator Mike Lee, the crowd repeatedly shouted "TARP! TARP! TARP!" The Occupiers, too, began on Wall Street.
The historian Richard Hofstadter once wrote a famous essay about the recurring strain of, as he put it, a "paranoid style in American politics" - an underlying readiness among average voters to see conspiracies among powerful elites supposedly plotting against them. He noted that the paranoia arises during periods of economic stress. 
But the web of interconnections linking Washington and Wall Street over the last decade or so - involving campaign contributions, revolving doors, and secret deals - has been so tight as to suggest that this newer anti-establishment activism is based on at least a kernel of truth.
Isolationist
Economic stresses caused Americans to turn inward during the Great Depression, and we're seeing the same drift this time around. Republican fulminations against the "cult of multiculturalism" are meeting similar sentiments in traditional Democratic precincts - especially when it comes to undocumented immigrants. Alabama and Arizona have spearheaded especially vicious laws, yet polls show increasing percentages of voters across America objecting to giving the children of illegal immigrants access to state-supported services.
Meanwhile, Americans are turning against global trade. Notwithstanding new trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia, only a minority of Americans now believes trade agreements benefit the U.S. economy. A growing percentage also want the U.S. out of the World Trade Organization. China has emerged as a special bogeyman. The Democratic-controlled Senate recently passing a bill to punish China for under-valuing its currency, but China-bashing is becoming bipartisan. Mitt Romney accuses former U.S. leaders of having "been played like a fiddle by the Chinese."
Neither immigration, nor trade, nor China's currency manipulation is the cause of America's high unemployment. All three predated the crash of 2008, before which unemployment was only 5 percent. Yet the current drift toward isolationism is not entirely irrational. As hundreds of millions of workers in emerging economies - especially in Asia - continue to enter the global workforce with steadily-improving skills and higher productivity, more and more Americans are losing ground. Meanwhile, immigration and trade are boons to top executives and professionals who gain access to cheaper labor and larger markets for their own skills and insights.
Generational
A third division likely to widen if the economy remains bad runs along a demographic fault-line. Many aging boomers whose nest eggs have turned the size of humming-bird eggs are understandably anxious about their retirement, while America's young - whose skins are more likely than those of boomer retirees to be brown or black - face years of joblessness.
The jobless rate among people under 25 is already over 17 percent. For young people of color it's above 20 percent. For young college grads - who assumed a bachelors' degree was a ticket to upward mobility - unemployment has reached 10 percent. Yet these percentages are likely to rise if boomers decide they can't afford to retire, and thereby block the jobs pipeline for younger people seeking employment.
Old and young will also find themselves increasingly at odds over public spending. In many communities retirees already resist property tax hikes to pay for local schools. Expect that resistance to grow as boomers have to live on fixed incomes smaller than they expected, and a new wave of young people swarm into the nation's educational systems. The federal budget will also be a scene of generational conflict. Medicare and Social Security, the two giant entitlement programs for seniors that cost more than $1 trillion a year and account for about a third of the federal budget, will be traded off against programs that benefit the young: Title I funding for low-income school-age students; Head Start; food
stamps; child nutrition; children's health; and vaccines. It's likely that Medicaid - Medicare's poor stepchild, half of whose recipients are children - will also be on the cutting board.
After the enactment of Medicare in 1965, poverty among the elderly declined markedly. But poverty among America's children continues to rise. Yet children don't have nearly as effective a lobbying presence in Washington. AARP spent $9.7 million on lobbying during first six months of this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. By contrast, the Children's Defense Fund spent just $48,245 last year. Yet because the future lies with the young and with an increasingly diverse America, politicians and parties looking toward the longer term will have to take heed.
Solutions?
How our political parties and leaders will cope with these three fault lines is far from clear, partly because the lines don't all move in same direction. Young Americans tend to be more anti-establishment than older Americans, for example, but are also more open to other nations and cultures. By the same token, a generational war over the budget might be avoided if anti-establishment movements succeed in reducing corporate welfare, raising taxes on the rich, and limiting Wall Street's rapacious hold over economic decision making. 
What seems certain, however, is that continued high unemployment coupled with slow or no growth will create a new political landscape. This will pose a special challenge - and opportunity. If our political leaders don't manage the new dividing lines effectively they could invite a politics of resentment that scapegoats certain groups while avoiding the hard work of setting priorities and making difficult choices.
On the other hand, if political leaders take advantage of the energies and possibilities this new landscape offers, they could usher in an era in which the fruits of growth are more widely shared: between elites and everyone else; between the beneficiaries of globalization and those most burdened by it; and between older Americans and young. This itself could reignite a virtuous cycle - a broad-based prosperity that not only generates more demand for goods and services and therefore more jobs, but also a more inclusive and generous politics.
There is a precedent for the second alternative. The structural reforms begun in the depression decade of the 1930s generated just this kind of virtuous cycle in the three decades after World War II. And in devising and implementing these reforms, the Democratic Party came to represent Americans with little power relative to the financial and business elites that had dominated the country before the great crash of 1929. That political realignment was the most profound and successful of the twentieth century.
Will it happen again? At this point, both parties are doing remarkably little given the gravity of the continuing jobs depression and the widening gap of income and wealth. Taming the budget deficit is the only significant issue anyone in Washington seems willing to raise yet Congress seems incapable of achieving any significant progress on this. And the budget itself is only indirectly related to the deeper questions of how to restart economic growth, how much of that growth should be allocated to public goods such as the environment or education, and how the benefits of that growth are to be shared. 
Political elites are worried about thunder on the right and the left, but they show scant understanding of what these growing anti-establishment forces signify. Meanwhile, the nation drifts.

PERSON: Eli Hurvitz 

HEADLINE: Eli Hurvitz, 79; Built a Generic-Drug Giant

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Eli Hurvitz, who began his career washing lab equipment at a drug company and went on to build Teva Pharmaceutical Industries into the largest generic drug maker in the world, died on Monday night. He was 79. 
His death was announced by Teva. No cause was given, but in an interview with the newspaper Yediot Aharonot earlier this year he said he had cancer. ''I am not the type to surrender,'' he told the paper. ''That is how it was in business, and that is how it is with the illness.''
Mr. Hurvitz started out in the 1950s at Assia, a small pharmaceutical company partly owned by his father-in-law, in Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv. He became managing director in 1976 and merged Assia with two other small firms, Zori and Teva, to form the company now known as Teva, which means ''nature'' in Hebrew. Mr. Hurvitz was the president and chief executive of Teva for the next 25 years.
Through aggressive mergers and acquisitions, a reputation for quality and low prices, Teva grew into a giant that supplied one of every six prescriptions dispensed in the United States. It has a presence in 60 countries and 45,000 employees. In 2010, it manufactured 63 billion tablets and reached $16 billion in sales.
After moving into branded drugs, Teva had a market breakthrough in the 1990s with the introduction of Copaxone, a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. Developed with researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, it became the first original Israeli drug to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.
Mr. Hurvitz stepped down as chief executive in 2002 and became chairman until 2010, when he retired.
Eliyahu Hurvitz was born in Jerusalem in 1932, when the country, then known as Palestine, was under British control. He moved to Tel Aviv with his family as a child. When the state of Israel was founded and the Arab-Israeli war broke out in 1948, Mr. Hurvitz was drafted and spent time on a kibbutz as part of a unit that established agricultural settlements.
He went on to study economics at a branch of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Tel Aviv. In 1953, he married Dalia Solomon and began working at Assia.
Mr. Hurvitz was awarded the Israel Prize in 2002 for lifetime achievement and his contributions to the state and society. Outside of his business he had been chairman of Bank Leumi, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel and chairman of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research institute in Jerusalem.
In a statement, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, called Mr. Hurvitz one of the country's great industrialists. ''Israeli initiative and the Israeli spirit had no better ambassador,'' he said.
The current president and chief of Teva, Shlomo Yanai, said Mr. Hurvitz's ''vision of providing access to affordable medicine has helped improve the lives of people around the world.''
Mr. Hurvitz is survived by his wife; three children, Vered, Dafna and Haim; and nine grandchildren.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Market in Iraqi Oil Port Is Hit by Fatal Series of Blasts

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; An Iraqi employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Basra.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- A series of three explosions in a crowded market on Thursday killed at least 10 people and wounded dozens more in the southern city of Basra, an important center of the Iraqi oil industry where many international companies have offices. 
As is often the case in Iraq, the bombs were timed to go off in succession, according to the police and local news reports. The first panicked the crowd, sending people running toward where a second bomb had been hidden.
A third explosive detonated as soldiers and emergency workers arrived to help the wounded. A local television station broadcast video showing the bodies of dead soldiers and civilians strewn on a sidewalk, along with debris and damaged cars.
A hospital worker said 10 people were killed. The Associated Press, citing health and police officials, reported that 19 people were killed, many of them soldiers, making the attack one of the most lethal in recent weeks.
Although the United States is withdrawing all of its soldiers from Iraq by the end of the year, security in the country is still tenuous, as was underscored by bombings in Basra. The Iraqi government had declined to grant immunity from prosecution to United States soldiers if the deadline for an American withdrawal were extended.
Basra is a predominantly Shiite city and a center of support for the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. The attack there, like others in mostly Shiite areas, seemed intended to undermine the government's authority by demonstrating that the police were unable to provide security.
Residents of the city who called into Fayha, the local television station, on Thursday evening seemed dismayed about the bombings and lashed out at the security forces, though many of their members were among the victims. ''We can do more than the people of Egypt,'' one caller said, referring to huge protests in Cairo this week against the Egyptian government. ''We can make a change.''
Another caller said: ''I'm just asking the security forces, why are there so many checkpoints around this market? But I never see anybody checking the trunks of cars.''
''What a scandal this is for the security forces,'' he added.
The Iraqi government has blamed two wings of the Sunni insurgency for most of the recent violence; one is linked to Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremists and the other is a Sunni nationalist movement said to have ties to remnants of the disbanded Baath Party, which ruled under Saddam Hussein.
Shiite militias have also been active in the nation's south.
Basra, a port city, is pivotal to the country's postwar economic development, which elevates the importance of security there. The vast majority of Iraq's oil output of 2.8 million barrels per day is pumped from three major fields -- Romaila, Zubair and West Qurna -- that are within about 60 miles of the city.
It was unclear whether the bombings were timed to coincide with the opening of the Basra International Oil and Gas Conference, scheduled for Friday, which will be attended by international petroleum company executives. Three weeks ago, bombs hidden in motorcycles killed three people and wounded about 30 others in the city.

HEADLINE: No N.B.A., So Basketball Fans Turn to the A.B.A.

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
The streets were eerily desolate last Friday night in downtown Richmond, the East Bay city where unemployment hovers around twice the national average. But outside the Richmond Memorial Auditorium, which recently hosted a woman's roller derby match and a local amateur boxing night, fans lined up to see the brand-new Richmond Rockets professional basketball team.
With the National Basketball Association lockout, fans of the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings have no reason to cheer. But the Bay Area still has professional basketball, with teams now playing in San Francisco, Richmond, Livermore and Pleasant Hill.
They are part of the reincarnated American Basketball Association. Four decades ago, the A.B.A. and its high-flying, flashy stars -- including Julius Erving, Moses Malone and Artis Gilmore -- pulled fans away from the slower, lower-scoring N.B.A. games with multicolored basketballs and innovations like the three-point shot. 
In its newest iteration, the A.B.A. has a different appeal: Tickets are inexpensive, and players are local celebrities who get paid blue-collar wages.
It is a recession-era answer to the N.B.A.
George and Rochester Devers, brothers who are 71 and 70 respectively and well over six feet tall, arrived early at the Richmond Memorial Auditorium to grab courtside seats. They cost $10, the same as all of the other seats in the arena. The elder Devers said he preferred the A.B.A. to the N.B.A., especially at a time when people have taken to the streets to protest economic inequality.
''You got people camping out in the street and then you got these players and owners arguing over billions of dollars, you got Kobe Bryant buying his wife some million-dollar ring,'' George Devers said. ''It's just hard to get on those people's side.''
Nearby, Ray Javier, an Amtrak engineer, settled in to watch the game with his family. A Warriors game usually costs the four of them around $200, including tickets, parking and food. So far, the Rockets game had cost them $40, which Ray and his wife, Lara, called ''refreshing.'' Their son, Michael, 13, said the A.B.A. seemed cool, but conceded that the Rockets were not well known among his friends.
These are the fans that Eric Marquis said he had in mind when he paid $10,000 earlier this year to buy the Richmond territory and buy into the league. There are about 80 A.B.A. teams across the country. Before Friday's matchup with the rival San Francisco Rumble, Marquis, a small man with a goatee, nervously surveyed the 2,200-seat arena. The first game had attracted about 800 fans and the Rockets were now 2-0, but he did not know what to expect.
After the pregame hip-hop music, spun on turntables by a teenager on the sideline, the announcer introduced the Rockets' starting five, leading off with the point guard whose name seemed to have been written for the script that the Rockets are selling. ''He steals from the opponent and gives to the Rockets. ... give it up for Robinnnnnn Hoooood Jr.!''
Quick to the basket, Robin Hood Jr. is a poor man's Dwyane Wade. Early in the game, the 6-foot-2 guard slashed past the Rumble defense for a layup, then later threw an alley-oop pass to a teammate who slammed it home, to the delight of the crowd.
The league has tried to spice up the game like the old A.B.A: The basketballs are multicolored and they have added a four-point shot for baskets made from behind the half-court line. The league also introduced the ''3-D Light,'' which is turned on after a ball is stolen in the backcourt and adds an extra point if the team scores.
Although the Rockets' black-and-white uniforms are more muted and coordinated than the colorful uniforms of yore, the team tries to inject its own brand of flash. The Rocket Girls danced during timeouts wearing short shorts and skimpy tops.
At the half, the fans were giddy as the Rockets held a comfortable 59-45 lead. But Marquis was still worried -- only about 400 paying fans had come through the gates. ''We should have more people coming in with the N.B.A. on strike,'' he said. He said that even with sponsorships from local businesses, he needs 1,000 fans a game to make the business work.
Players like Hood know first-hand about the impermanence of A.B.A. teams, which have been known to disappear overnight since the league was reborn in 2000. Hood's first stint was with a San Diego A.B.A. team, when he was fresh out of Regis University in Denver; it ended after the first game of the season. The team folded because the owner's family incurred some unforeseen medical costs, Hood said. ''It was just a phone call and they said, 'It's not going on anymore,' '' he said.
The A.B.A. is full of players like Hood, 28, a standout at a small college who did not attract attention from N.B.A. scouts. After Hood graduated from Regis, he played in leagues from Mexico to Ireland. And he has his own story about coming ''this close'' to the big show.
''It's such an up-and-down feeling sometimes, you have no clue what's keeping you going, you just have faith,'' Hood said. ''This sense of just having faith that there might just be a chance. Just playing in the A.B.A., you never know if a Warriors scout or a Kings scout might come down to Richmond.''
The pay is also a come-down. The average salary in the N.B.A. is $5.2 million for an 82-game season. The A.B.A. imposes a salary cap of $120,000 for the whole team, and the league plays a 30-game schedule from November to March. The East Bay Pit Bulls of Livermore pay players based on the number of minutes played. The Rockets, Hood said, pays players between $300 and $600 a game.
''I'd say it's a little better than a part-time job,'' Hood said. ''For the four or five months it's going on, it's above minimum wage. But really it's just great to be playing basketball, doing something you love.''
Hood and most other A.B.A. players hold down other jobs to support their basketball passion. He is a personal trainer in Lafayette.
Dan Rascher, a sports management professor at the University of San Francisco, consulted briefly for the A.B.A. when it was re-starting, and was surprised to hear that the league had survived. When asked if the A.B.A. would gain any traction with the N.B.A. on strike, Rascher answered quickly: ''No.''
''Historically, if you look at what happens with strikes, fans return pretty quickly,'' Rascher said. ''It's hard to have a competitive league for a major sport because fans really just want to see the best of the best.''
Still, Rascher said if the cost of putting on games is low enough, which it seems to be, the league could continue to be viable.
In Friday night's game, the Rockets ended up blowing their lead, and fell to the Rumble, 107-97. But by then the Devers brothers were true fans, already complaining about the coach's decisions. Rochester said he and his brother would be back.
''Look at these seats,'' he said. ''We're right down here by the court in the middle of all the action, and you can actually afford it. Imagine that.''

HEADLINE: Why We Spend, Why They Save

BYLINE: By SHELDON GARON. 
Sheldon Garon, a professor of history and East Asian studies at Princeton, is the author of ''Beyond Our Means: Why America Spends While the World Saves.''

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
CHRISTMAS is nearly upon us. Americans, once again, are told that it's our civic duty to shop. The economy demands increased consumer spending. And it's true. The problem is that millions of lower- and middle-income households have lost their capacity to spend. They lack savings and are mired in debt. Although it would be helpful if affluent households spent more, we shouldn't be calling upon a struggling majority to do so. In the long run, the health of the economy depends on the financial stability of our households.
What might we learn from societies that promote a more balanced approach to saving and spending? Few Americans appreciate that the prosperous economies of western and northern Europe are among the world's greatest savers. Over the past three decades, Germany, France, Austria and Belgium have maintained household saving rates between 10 and 13 percent, and rates in Sweden recently soared to 13 percent. By contrast, saving rates in the United States dropped to nearly zero by 2005; they rose above 5 percent after the 2008 crisis but have recently fallen below 4 percent. 
Unlike the United States, the thrifty societies of Europe have long histories of encouraging the broad populace to save. During the 19th century, European reformers and governments became preoccupied with creating prudent citizens. Civic groups founded hundreds of savings banks that enabled the masses to save by accepting small deposits. Central governments established accessible postal savings banks, whereby small savers could bank at any post office. To inculcate thrifty habits in the young, governments also instituted school savings banks. During the two world wars, citizens everywhere were bombarded with messages to save. Savings campaigns continued long after 1945 in Europe and Japan to finance reconstruction.
All this fostered cultures of saving that endure today in many advanced economies. The French government attracts millions of lower-income and young savers with its Livret A account available at savings banks, postal savings banks and all other banks. This small savers' account is tax free, requires only a tiny minimum balance, and commonly pays above-market interest rates. In German cities, one cannot turn the corner without coming upon one of the immensely popular savings banks, called Sparkassen. Legally charged with encouraging the ''savings mentality,'' these banks offer no-fee accounts for the young and sponsor financial education in the schools.
Supported by public opinion, policy makers in European countries have also restrained the expansion of consumer and housing credit, lest citizens become ''overindebted.'' Home equity loans are rare in Germany, and Belgians, Italians and Germans are rarely offered an American-style credit card that allows the user to carry an unpaid balance.
How did America arrive at its widely divergent approach to saving and consumption? Seldom over the past two centuries has the federal government promoted saving; it left matters to the states or the market. In the 19th century, savings banks and building and loan associations did thrive in the Northeastern and Midwestern states; where they existed, working people saved at high rates. However, the vast majority of Americans in the Southern and Western states lacked access to any savings institution as late as 1910. Most Americans became regular savers only after the federal government decisively intervened to institute the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1934 and mass-market United States savings bonds in World War II.
The United States emerged from the war with unparalleled prosperity and hardly needed further savings campaigns. Instead politicians, businessmen and labor leaders all promoted consumption as the new driver of economic growth. Rather than democratize saving, the American system rapidly democratized credit. An array of federal housing and tax policies enabled Americans to borrow to buy homes and products as no other people could.
But from the 1980s, financial deregulation and new tax legislation spurred the growth of credit cards, home equity loans, subprime mortgages and predatory lending. Soaring home prices emboldened the financial industry to make housing and consumer loans that many Americans could no longer repay. Still, Americans wondered, why save when it is so easy to borrow? Only after housing prices collapsed in 2008 did they discover that wealth on paper is not the same as money in the bank.
As we seek to restore a balance between saving and consumption, what aspects of other nations' experiences might we adapt to our circumstances? The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, while politically besieged, possesses broad powers to curb predatory lending. The bureau might also promote the creation of financial education programs in every school. Congress should consider ending costly tax incentives for wealthier savers and homebuyers while creating new incentives to encourage low- and middle-income people to save. Finally, federal intervention is needed to stop the banks from fleecing and driving away their poorest customers. If the banks cannot be encouraged to offer low-fee accounts for young and lower-income customers, the government might consider creating postal savings accounts for small savers.
To improve the balance sheets of America's households, we must approach saving in a more forthright manner -- not an easy thing to do when again and again we hear that individual prudence acts to impair the economy.

HEADLINE: In Hard Times, Rethinking Plans for Retirement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Goodbye, Golden Years'' (Sunday Review, Nov. 20), Edward L. Glaeser writes that older workers are delaying retirement because of long-term factors and the Great Recession. We disagree about the role of the recession, based on our research cited by Professor Glaeser. 
In our 2009 book, ''Reconsidering Retirement,'' we show that retirement rates began falling in 1994 as workers delayed retirement in response to changes in Social Security and pensions. Since 2006, though, the retirement rate has been flat. The Great Recession has not caused substantial retirement delays.
Indeed, if we had expected the retirement rate to continue falling, the flat rate observed now suggests that workers are accelerating retirement because of the recession. Workers who respond to a job loss by retiring and claiming Social Security benefits early will have lower incomes for the rest of their lives. The public has yet to pay sufficient attention to the problems facing these workers.
COURTNEY C. COILE PHILLIP B. LEVINE Wellesley, Mass., Nov. 21, 2011
The writers are, respectively, associate professor and professor of economics at Wellesley College.
To the Editor:
Edward L. Glaeser has useful observations about Americans entering what we still think of as the ''retirement'' years. But I disagree with his interpretation of the big increase in the number of Americans aged roughly 60 to 70 who are ''self-employed.''
The majority of those people are not entrepreneurs busy creating new and useful goods and services whose production will employ lots of young workers. Rather, they are underemployed middle-aged and older people who have been downsized or otherwise lost jobs, many of them professional, who now scramble to describe themselves as self-employed or consultants.
They do so because they are trying to maintain their self-image and dignity while looking for something to do in the face of involuntarily shortened careers. And most of them aren't very happy about it.
JANE SJOGREN O'NEIL Boston, Nov. 21, 2011

HEADLINE: The Age of the Superfluous Worker

BYLINE: By HERBERT J. GANS. 
Herbert J. Gans, an emeritus professor of sociology at Columbia, is the author of ''Imagining America in 2033.''

 BODY:
AMERICA, like other modern countries, has always had some surplus workers -- people ready to work but jobless for extended periods because the ''job creators,'' private and public, have been unable or unwilling to create sufficient jobs. When the number of surplus workers rose sharply, the country also had ways of reducing it.
However, the current jobless recovery, and the concurrent failure to create enough new jobs, is breeding a new and growing surplus pool. And some in this pool are in danger of becoming superfluous, likely never to work again. 
The currently jobless and the so-called discouraged workers, who have given up looking for work, total about 15 percent of the work force, not including the invisible discouraged workers the government cannot even find to count.
In the old days -- before Social Security, welfare and Medicaid -- poverty-caused illnesses killed off or incapacitated some of the people who could not find jobs. Even earlier, some nations sold their surplus workers as slaves, while the European countries could send them to the colonies.
In addition, wars were once labor-intensive enterprises that absorbed the surplus temporarily, and sufficient numbers of those serving in the infantry and on warships were killed or seriously enough injured so that they could not add to the peacetime labor surplus.
The old ways of reducing surplus labor are, however, disappearing. Decades of medical and public health advances, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, have reduced the number of poverty-related deaths. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars have left many more service members injured than killed.
Over the past quarter-century, one very costly way of decreasing the surplus has been the imprisonment of people, mostly dark-skinned men, for actual and invented offenses. Felons are not often hired when they leave prison. Many, at least those who do not become recidivists, become surplus and then superfluous labor. As incarceration becomes less affordable for financially strapped states, inmates will reach surplus or superfluous status at a younger age.
Meanwhile, new ways of increasing surplus labor have appeared. One is the continued outsourcing of jobs to low-wage countries; the other is the continuing computerization and mechanization of manufacturing and of services not requiring hands-on human contact. Continuing increases in worker productivity add yet more to the surplus. So does the unwillingness of employers to even consider hiring people who have been unemployed for a long time.
When the jobless recovery ends and the economy is restored to good health, today's surplus will be reduced. New technology and the products and services that accompany it will create new jobs. But unless the economy itself changes, eventually many of these innovations may be turned over to machines or the jobs may be sent to lower-wage economies.
In fact, if modern capitalism continues to eliminate as many jobs as it creates -- or more jobs than it creates -- future recoveries will not only add to the amount of surplus labor but will turn a growing proportion of workers into superfluous ones.
What could be done to prevent such a future? America will have to finally get serious about preserving and creating jobs -- and on a larger, and more lasting, scale than Roosevelt's New Deal. Private enterprise and government will have to think in terms of industrial policy, and one that emphasizes labor-intensive economic growth and innovation. Reducing class sizes in all public schools to 15 or fewer would require a great many new teachers even as it would raise the quality of education.
In the long run, reducing working time -- perhaps to as low as 30 hours a week, with the lost income made up by unemployment compensation -- would lead to a modest increase in jobs, through work sharing. New taxes on income and wealth are unavoidable, as are special taxes on the capital-intensive part of the economy. Policies that are now seemingly utopian will have to be tried as well, and today's polarized and increasingly corporate-run democracy will have to be turned into a truly representative one.
Whatever the costs, they would be a small price to preserve America as a healthy society. A society that has permanently expelled a significant proportion of its members from the work force would soon deteriorate into an unbelievably angry country, with intense and continuing conflict between the have-jobs and have-nones. America could become a very sick society, just when it needed to be stronger than ever to flourish in the global economy.

HEADLINE: Arab League Warns Syria to Admit Foreign Monitors or Risk Sanctions

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI; Hwaida Saad and an employee of The New York Times contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- In a humiliating affront for the Syrian government, Arab foreign ministers called Thursday for Syria to agree to admit international monitors within 24 hours or face economic sanctions, while activists reported new clashes between army troops and defectors that left 29 dead across the country.
The announcement from the Arab League ministers came after the European Union said Thursday that safeguarding civilians against President Bashar al-Assad's ferocious crackdown had become a priority. The death toll in eight months of violence now exceeds 3,500, the figure cited by the United Nations in early November. 
''Protection of civilians in Syria is an increasingly urgent and important aspect of responding to the events in country,'' said Maja Kocijancic, a European Union spokeswoman, in a statement.
But the European Union stopped short of endorsing a proposal floated Wednesday by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France to set up humanitarian corridors -- with or without the consent of the Syrian government -- to allow aid groups into the country. Such a step would be a major escalation of foreign involvement in what has become one of the bloodiest of the Arab Spring uprisings.
In a special meeting in Cairo, the Arab League called on Syria to agree by Friday to admit a mission of 500 civilian and military observers to monitor the human rights situation and oversee efforts to carry out a peace plan that Syria agreed to on Nov. 2.
The Arab League suspended Syria this month after it failed to comply with the plan, under which it had pledged to withdraw all military units from the streets, stop killing protesters and allow the monitors to enter the country.
The league said that if Syria refused to admit the monitors, it would meet again on Saturday to discuss sanctions that could include the suspension of all trade except for essential humanitarian goods, a ban on flights to Syria, a travel ban on Syrian officials, and the freezing of all transactions with the central bank and of all Arab economic projects under way in Syria.
If enacted, the new penalties would deal a stinging blow to an economy already suffering under sanctions from the European Union and the United States. Syria's two most vital sectors, oil and tourism, which account for more than a third of the government's revenues, have all but come to a halt.
While there was no official response from the leadership in Damascus, Syrian state television said that the government would reject the deal as an infringement on its sovereignty.
While the diplomatic wheels turned, violence continued unabated throughout the country, which has appeared in recent weeks to be sliding inexorably into civil war. Activists said that at least 29 people were killed Thursday, 28 of them in Homs in central Syria and its surrounding villages, and one in Talkalakh in northern Syria, according to the Local Coordination Committees, a group of activists who are involved in planning and documenting the uprising.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that at least 11 soldiers were also killed in Houla, a village on the outskirts of Homs, during clashes with army defectors. The group, which is based in London, added that security forces killed 15 defectors who were hiding in Rastan, one of the most volatile areas of Homs Province, where large numbers of the deserters are believed to be hiding.
Homs has been the scene of horrific sectarian clashes between the majority Muslims and sizable minorities of Christians and Alawites, the Muslim sect that provides much of the country's leadership. In recent weeks there have been reports of beheadings, frequent drive-by shootings and revenge killings. The situation there is described by activists as grave, with shortages of food, water and medical supplies.
''We are running out of basic food items and don't have gas to turn heaters on,'' said one resident from Homs who gave his name as Muhammad. ''We don't know how we are going to survive.''
Because of the appalling conditions in Homs and some other rebellious cities, the government is reluctant to admit the monitors, said Samir Nachar, a member of the opposition Syrian National Council.
At the same time, he said, the Syrian government is desperate to avoid having the issue taken up again by the United Nations, which has yet to impose sanctions.
''They are torn between allowing the monitors in and facing a scandal, or not allowing them and facing the United Nations'' and the Arab League's sanctions, Mr. Nachar said.
In his proposal, Mr. Juppe, the French foreign minister, called for sending international monitors to Syria, with or without its approval, but he added that the observers would need an armed escort for their protection. He said he was in contact with the United Nations, the United States and the Arab League over setting up humanitarian corridors, which could be used by groups like the Red Cross to carry aid to the worst-hit areas.
Mr. Juppe called the situation in Syria ''no longer tenable'' and accused Mr. Assad of ''repression of a savagery we have not seen in a long time.''
He told French radio that if the effort to set up the humanitarian corridors was stymied, then ''we'd have to look at other solutions with international observers.''
In contrast to their stance on Libya, Arab leaders have opposed any military intervention in Syria.

PERSON: Christopher Ma 

HEADLINE: Christopher Ma, 61, Washington Post Executive

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Christopher Ma, the Washington Post Company's senior vice president for new business development and publisher of Express, the company's free commuter tabloid newspaper for the Washington area, died in New York City on Wednesday. He was 61 and lived in Washington. 
The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Nathalie Gilfoyle.
Donald E. Graham, chairman of the Post Company, said in a statement to the corporate staff that Mr. Ma had been given a diagnosis of cancer a week ago and was being examined at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center when he collapsed. He was rushed to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he died. His wife and two children were with him.
In a wide-ranging career of more than three decades in journalism, Mr. Ma was a Washington correspondent for the Post Company's Newsweek magazine in the 1980s, covering economics and foreign affairs, including the Iranian hostage crisis. He later was an editor and a deputy editor of U.S. News & World Report until 1996, when he became the editor and developer of The Washington Post's Web site, washingtonpost.com.
From 1998 to 2000, he was the executive editor of The Post's online subsidiary, which was renamed WPNI, for Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive. He originated its Live Online talk programming and was instrumental in negotiating a partnership of the Post Company, Newsweek, MSNBC and NBC News.
Mr. Ma became a corporate vice president in 2000, started the commuter tabloid Express in 2003 and was named senior vice president in 2008.
Christopher Yi-Wen Ma was born in Columbus, Ohio, on March 20, 1950. He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Harvard College in 1972, and spent several years traveling in the Far East on a Michael Clark Rockefeller Memorial Fellowship and developing literacy programs in China.
Mr. Ma was the co-author of ''The Practical Guide to Practically Everything'' (1995, with Peter Bernstein), which covered consumer developments, from health and money matters to personal technology, travel and education.
He graduated from law school at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1978, and practiced law for six months before deciding that his future lay in journalism.
Besides his wife, whom he married in 1978, Mr. Ma is survived by a daughter, Olivia Otey Ma, of San Francisco; a son, Rohan, of Oakland, Calif.; his mother, Margaret Ma, of Menlo Park, Calif.; two sisters, Louise Ma and Cathryn Ma, both of San Francisco; and a brother, Philip Ma, of San Carlos, Calif.

HEADLINE: Portugal Downgrade Hurts Stocks In Europe

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- European stocks and the euro fell Thursday after a credit agency cut Portugal's sovereign debt to ''junk,'' or below investment grade.
The decision by Fitch Ratings to cut Portugal's bond rating one notch, to BB-plus from BBB-minus, was a reminder of the dangers hanging over the euro zone.
In its assessment, Fitch cited its forecast for Portugal's economy to contract by 3 percent next year, saying ''the recession makes the government's deficit-reduction plan much more challenging and will negatively impact bank asset quality.'' 
Moody's Investors Service cut the bonds to junk status in July, while Standard & Poor's rates them just above that level.
Earlier, European equities and the euro rose after a report by the Ifo Institute, a private research center, showed business sentiment improving in Germany, the largest economy in Europe.
The institute said its main business climate index for Germany improved in November to 106.6 from 106.4 in October, the first gain in four months, and a sign that the German economy ''is still performing relatively well despite the international turmoil.''
With markets in New York closed for Thanksgiving, trading volume was subdued, particularly in contrast with a day earlier. On Wednesday, global equity markets and bonds were upended by the failure of the German government to sell a large part of the debt it was offering at auction, igniting fears that investors might have lost faith in all euro zone sovereign assets.
At the close of trading, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, fell 0.31 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London fell 0.24 percent.
German 10-year bonds, which became the focus of attention on Wednesday, continued to fall in price. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 5 basis points to 2.19 percent. Portuguese 10-year bonds fell more heavily, trading to yield 11.42 percent, up 84 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
The euro fell to $1.3336 from $1.3341 late Wednesday in New York, while the British pound fell to $1.5501 from $1.5555. The dollar fell to 0.9192 Swiss francs from 0.9201 francs, and to 77.11 Japanese yen from 77.31 yen.
Neil Mellor, a currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London, said there was a feeling in the market ''that we're getting to a tipping point, that we're definitely close to something,'' but he expressed optimism that the Continent would weather the storm.
He said the euro's level against the dollar, above last year's low and well above its historical average of around $1.15, suggested that the market was ''inclined to give the euro a break.''
''Against the backdrop of a permanent crisis in the euro zone, you have to ask why the euro remains at these levels,'' Mr. Mellor said. ''That speaks volumes about the market's view of the euro.''
United States crude oil futures rose 0.8 percent to $96.99 a barrel. Comex gold futures were little changed at $1,696 an ounce.
Asian shares were mixed. The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average, which had been closed Wednesday for a holiday, fell 1.8 percent, catching up with the global sell-off. The Sydney market index S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.2 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index gained 0.4 percent and in Shanghai the composite index added 0.1 percent.

HEADLINE: For Online Retailing Holdouts, a Final Holiday Season of No Sales Tax

BYLINE: By AARON GLANTZ. 
aglantz@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
California shoppers have one last chance to avoid paying state sales taxes on many of their online purchases this holiday season.
By the time Black Friday rolls around next year, Amazon.com and other Internet retailers will have begun collecting sales taxes on purchases made by their California customers, the result of a deal struck with lawmakers in September. 
''It will level the playing field,'' said Loni Hancock, a state senator from Berkeley who wrote the new tax law. ''You will no longer get a 10 percent discount if you buy over the Internet.''
Brick-and-mortar retailers lobbied hard for the new law, which they said could significantly change shopping patterns.
''It will cause Internet shoppers to shop in a different universe,'' said Bill Dombrowski, president and chief executive of the California Association of Retailers. Mr. Dombrowski said the most immediate beneficiaries could be large retailers like Macy's and Barnes & Noble, which, unlike Amazon, have been collecting sales tax on Internet purchases.
''People have essentially been using our stores as showrooms,'' Mr. Dombrowski said. Shoppers often touch and test products in the physical stores before buying them online, where they are often cheaper, he said.
Amazon spent at least $5.25 million on -- and collected signatures in support of -- a ballot initiative to overturn an Internet sales tax law that California lawmakers passed in June.
But in September the company, which is based in Seattle, abruptly reversed course and said it would shelve its ballot initiative. It promised to create 10,000 full-time jobs and to hire 25,000 seasonal employees in California by the end of 2015, in return for the state's agreeing to delay the Internet tax collection law until September 2012.
Amazon representatives declined to explain the sudden change. Instead, the company e-mailed a statement from Paul Misener, its vice president for global public policy, praising as a ''win-win'' a federal bill introduced this month by Senator Richard J. Durban, Democrat of Illinois, that would give states the authority to require online retailers to collect state sales taxes in any state where they do not operate stores or otherwise have a physical presence.
According to Daniel Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California: ''They may have realized what a protracted and high-profile fight could do to their otherwise pristine brand.'' He said that if the company had continued to try to overturn the California law, well-heeled retailers most likely would have sought to portray Amazon as a tax cheat.
Even when Amazon starts collecting state taxes next year, some experts said, the company would still have a major advantage over its bricks-and-mortar rivals.
''Amazon will respond with new programs and promotions to keep their customers,'' said Peter Bucklin, emeritus professor at the University of California's Haas School of Business.
''They already have a marvelous return policy,'' he said, ''and when you buy a number of things from Amazon at one time they offer discounts and free transportation of the merchandise.''

HEADLINE: Nevada: Charities Ask For Ids

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Some Las Vegas charities giving away turkeys and toys this season have started asking families to show state identification. The Salvation Army, HELP of Southern Nevada and Lutheran Social Services say the move to require Social Security, state identification cards or birth certificates was needed to prevent fraud born of desperation in a state at the center of the country's financial crisis. ''We're really anxious to preserve the magic of Christmas for children, but we need to screen the adults,'' said Maj. Robert Lloyd, director of the Salvation Army of Clark County. Major Lloyd said some families were either ''double dipping'' or coming from out of state to get donations. Charities cited instances of parents' selling bicycles just blocks from a charity that gave them away. Unemployment in Nevada was the highest in the nation in October, 13.4 percent. 
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pro League Is Fighting To Retain Top Status

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
The top professional soccer league for women, which has only five teams, is in danger of losing sanctioning from US Soccer, the sport's governing body in the United States.
Women's Professional Soccer completed its third season last summer on the heels of the Women's World Cup. Most of the players on the United States team, which lost to Japan in the riveting tournament final, also played in W.P.S. They returned from Germany to acclaim and the league experienced a modest bump in attendance as the Western New York Flash, based in Rochester, won the championship.
The six-team league was reduced to five when league officials terminated the magicJack franchise in South Florida. The team's owner, Dan Borislow, who invented the device of the same name to make inexpensive telephone calls, subsequently filed a lawsuit suit against W.P.S. 
According to US Soccer's bylaws, all professional leagues are required to have a minimum of eight teams. With only six (all in the eastern part of the country) in 2011, W.P.S. requested and was granted a one-year waiver by the federation's board of directors. Now with only five teams a certainty for the 2012 season, W.P.S. requested an extension of the waver to take it through a season that will include the London Olympics in the hope of attracting new investors before 2013.
''Our primary goal is to retain our D1 status,'' Jennifer O'Sullivan, the league's commissioner, said Thursday in a telephone interview. ''We just came off a phenomenal season in 2011 and it feels like this is our time. We want to grab that and run with it.''
We are determined to provide the platform for the development of the next generation of national team players. There's too much here to walk away from. But for an additional team, we are in a time crunch and we don't want to rush into anything.''
Last Sunday, the federation gave the league 15 days to secure a sixth team (there have been reports that a club in Connecticut might join the league) before it makes a decision whether to extend the waiver. Neil Buethe, a spokesman, said the federation would have no further comment until the matter is resolved.
''We have a group of dedicated owners who want to make sure the league survives in an incredibly challenging economic environment and we need help in building the sport,'' said Jack Cummings, one of the league's founders. ''There was a great passionate response from the American public as a result of the World Cup. We have another event next summer with the Olympics. US Soccer is either being bureaucratically pedantic saying we need at least six teams or it's pushing the league into the grave.''
W.P.S. is the second attempt to sustain a D1 professional league for women. The Women's United Soccer Association got its start after the successful 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States and lasted for three seasons before folding in 2003. After several delays, W.P.S. was finally launched in the spring of 2009, less than a year after the United States women won the Olympic gold medal at the Beijing Games.
''It's partly because of the W.U.S.A. and now W.P.S. that we won gold in 2008 and silver at the World Cup,'' said Jennifer Hitchon, the executive director of the union that represents the league's players. She added, ''The league is fragile and fraught with problems, but it's ours and the federation will be hard-pressed to effectively shut down the last best chance for a women's pro soccer league in this country.''
If its waiver extension is rejected and the federation strips it of D1 status, the league could continue, but national team players, from the United States and elsewhere would not jeopardize their international eligibility by playing in what would in essence be an outlaw league. It would probably be more realistic for W.P.S. to go with five teams in a Division 2 league, but that might be less attractive to the players in the United States Olympic pool and from overseas. W.P.S. could bide its time and try to regain its top-flight status for the 2013 season with additional teams and investors.
But, as O'Sullivan said, retaining top-flight status is the first option.
Hitchon is concerned that US Soccer would prevail upon national team players not to play in a Division 2 league and instead to be part of a residency camp leading up to the Olympics (should the American team qualify at a tournament in Vancouver, British Columbia, in January) that would probably be held at the Home Depot Center in Carson, Calif., making it difficult for the players to shuttle back and forth to their East Coast teams.
If the league folds, Cummings believes it could be the death knell for top-flight women's pro soccer in the United States, even as interest from a new batch of owners has increased after last summer's World Cup.
He said that investors in Los Angeles are interested in relaunching the Sol and that several clubs that also field teams in Major League Soccer, the men's league, are keen to launch W.P.S. teams in the Pacific Northwest. In addition, ESPN has plans to launch a sports channel aimed a women that could be a natural home for W.P.S. games, which have in the past been carried by Fox Soccer, on Sunday evenings last season.
''If we don't get the waiver the damage will be irreparable,'' Cummings said. ''The ripples will be felt around the world and it will be a setback for women's soccer worldwide.''

HEADLINE: AT&T Merger With T-Mobile Faces Setbacks

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and JENNA WORTHAM; Edward Wyatt reported from Washington and Jenna Wortham from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- AT&T and T-Mobile USA edged closer to scrapping their proposed merger, saying on Thursday that they had withdrawn their application to the Federal Communications Commission to join their cellular phone operations.
Deutsche Telekom, the parent of T-Mobile, and AT&T said in a joint statement that they still intended to pursue the $39 billion merger and would prepare for a federal antitrust lawsuit that is seeking to block the deal. But the companies also said that AT&T planned to take a $4 billion charge against earnings to reflect the potential breakup fees that AT&T would have to pay Deutsche Telekom if the deal failed to go through.
The actions followed the decision this week by Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, that the merger did not meet the commission's standard for approval. Mr. Genachowski sent other commissioners a proposed order to refer the case to an administrative law judge, the first step toward a commission move to block the deal, which would combine the second- and fourth-largest cellphone carriers in the United States.
The application withdrawal appears in part meant to prevent the F.C.C. from making public AT&T and T-Mobile records about the potential effects of the merger, records that could then be used by the Justice Department in the antitrust trial. 
The companies have maintained publicly that the deal would not lessen competition and that it would create jobs in the United States. But the Justice Department has said that the merger would severely restrict competition, and F.C.C. officials have said that AT&T's confidential filings indicate the merger would eliminate jobs.
The withdrawal of the F.C.C. application ''is a tacit acknowledgment by AT&T that this story is all but over,'' said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''The fat lady hasn't started singing yet, but she's holding the mike, and the band is about to play.''
The efforts by the Justice Department's antitrust division and the F.C.C. to block the merger reflect a reinvigoration of federal efforts to rein in excessive business practices after a prolonged period of deregulation that preceded the 2008 financial crisis.
President Obama came into office pledging to take a harder look at the antitrust implications of proposed mergers, but the Justice Department was criticized by consumer groups in its first year for appearing hesitant to follow through on that promise.
Similarly, the F.C.C. drew rebukes for its approval last year of the merger between Comcast and NBC Universal, which critics claimed would concentrate too much power over both television content and its transmission to consumers.
The move this week to conduct a hearing on the cellphone deal was the first time the F.C.C. had done so on a merger since the 2002 proposed alliance between Echostar and Direct TV, which ultimately was scrapped.
In the current case, however, AT&T has noted that expansion of the nation's Internet infrastructure is one of Mr. Obama's top goals to help rebuild the economy, and the F.C.C. itself has predicted that its recent initiative to expand broadband Internet access to rural areas would create hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Consumer groups, which generally have opposed the merger, said this week's combined actions indicated that the deal was falling apart.
''The chances that AT&T will take over T-Mobile are almost gone,'' Gigi B. Sohn, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. ''While you can never count out AT&T entirely, the fact that they pulled their F.C.C. application speaks volumes about the company's lack of confidence'' in getting approval.
Deutsche Telekom, based in Germany, said in a statement that the withdrawal ''is being undertaken by both companies to consolidate their strength and to focus their continuing efforts on obtaining antitrust clearance for the transaction from the Department of Justice. As soon as practical, Deutsche Telekom and AT&T intend to seek necessary F.C.C. approval.''
AT&T issued its own statement saying that the companies were taking this step ''to facilitate the consideration of all options at the F.C.C.,'' as well as to consider other options.
The company said the $4 billion pretax charge, to be taken in the current quarter, reflects a $3 billion cash payment and $1 billion worth of cellular airwaves, or spectrum, that AT&T must pay to T-Mobile's parent if the merger does not receive regulatory approval.
Tammy Sun, an F.C.C. spokeswoman, confirmed that the commission had received the AT&T and T-Mobile request to withdraw the application.
The commission is not obligated to grant the request, however. It could deny the request, going ahead with its consideration and judicial hearing, or it could grant the request with prejudice, meaning that AT&T could not later refile the application. That would essentially kill the deal.
When AT&T agreed to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom in March, the deal looked like a happy ending for T-Mobile, which had been bleeding customers and battling against declining sales. The company has struggled to retain and add new customers as AT&T, Verizon and Sprint have attracted new mobile phone shoppers with popular handsets like the iPhone and the promise of faster networks and data services.
Over the last eight quarters, the mobile industry over all has added a net 33 million customers in the United States; T-Mobile has added only 89,000 of those, according to Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst.
A dissolution of the merger could leave T-Mobile in a much worse position than it was prior to March, when the acquisition was first announced. Analysts say that since then, the company most likely froze any major negotiations with smartphone and tablet manufactures like Apple to avoid interfering with any deals under way between AT&T and those hardware vendors.
That could severely limit T-Mobile's ability to lure customers from competitors over the coming quarters if the merger is abandoned. But the spectrum that T-Mobile would receive from AT&T in a breakup could help the company, perhaps making it attractive to another company or investment group looking to get into the cellular and mobile broadband business.
Deutsche Telekom has made clear that it no longer wants to be in the mobile phone business in the United States, saying it would stop investing in cellular infrastructure here to concentrate on its European operations. If the merger falls through, the German company may decide to spin off the unit as an independent entity, sell it at a less attractive price to a rival like Sprint Nextel or sell it off in pieces. Possible proceeds from the deal had been earmarked to reduce debt and buy back stock.
While there has long been talk about a possible combination of T-Mobile with Sprint, the Justice Department's opposition to the AT&T combination would seem to indicate problems for Sprint, the No. 3 cellphone carrier. Verizon is currently the largest carrier, but the AT&T purchase of T-Mobile would have vaulted the combined entity into first place.
For AT&T, the acquisition of T-Mobile and its wireless spectrum could mean improved service and network quality, crucial for helping the carrier ramp up its rivalry with Verizon.
AT&T has been looking for ways to keep an edge over the other carriers since losing its exclusivity as the sole carrier of the iPhone in the United States earlier this year.
Analysts expected that acquiring T-Mobile would give AT&T the ability to price its plans and handsets more aggressively, since hardware makers might be willing to offer AT&T a lower rate for large volume purchases of new smartphones and tablet computers.
Even if AT&T wins its case with the Justice Department, it must receive F.C.C. approval to be able to take over T-Mobile's licenses to operate its network on the public airwaves.
The decision by the F.C.C. to request a judicial hearing on the merger had already caused Christopher C. King, a telecommunications analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, to put the probability of the deal being completed as low as 10 to 20 percent.
''At some point,'' Mr. King said, ''AT&T is going to have to face the reality that this deal is pretty much dead.''

HEADLINE: We Are The 99.9%

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''We are the 99 percent'' is a great slogan. It correctly defines the issue as being the middle class versus the elite (as opposed to the middle class versus the poor). And it also gets past the common but wrong establishment notion that rising inequality is mainly about the well educated doing better than the less educated; the big winners in this new Gilded Age have been a handful of very wealthy people, not college graduates in general.
If anything, however, the 99 percent slogan aims too low. A large fraction of the top 1 percent's gains have actually gone to an even smaller group, the top 0.1 percent -- the richest one-thousandth of the population. 
And while Democrats, by and large, want that super-elite to make at least some contribution to long-term deficit reduction, Republicans want to cut the super-elite's taxes even as they slash Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in the name of fiscal discipline.
Before I get to those policy disputes, here are a few numbers.
The recent Congressional Budget Office report on inequality didn't look inside the top 1 percent, but an earlier report, which only went up to 2005, did. According to that report, between 1979 and 2005 the inflation-adjusted, after-tax income of Americans in the middle of the income distribution rose 21 percent. The equivalent number for the richest 0.1 percent rose 400 percent.
For the most part, these huge gains reflected a dramatic rise in the super-elite's share of pretax income. But there were also large tax cuts favoring the wealthy. In particular, taxes on capital gains are much lower than they were in 1979 -- and the richest one-thousandth of Americans account for half of all income from capital gains.
Given this history, why do Republicans advocate further tax cuts for the very rich even as they warn about deficits and demand drastic cuts in social insurance programs?
Well, aside from shouts of ''class warfare!'' whenever such questions are raised, the usual answer is that the super-elite are ''job creators'' -- that is, that they make a special contribution to the economy. So what you need to know is that this is bad economics. In fact, it would be bad economics even if America had the idealized, perfect market economy of conservative fantasies.
After all, in an idealized market economy each worker would be paid exactly what he or she contributes to the economy by choosing to work, no more and no less. And this would be equally true for workers making $30,000 a year and executives making $30 million a year. There would be no reason to consider the contributions of the $30 million folks as deserving of special treatment.
But, you say, the rich pay taxes! Indeed, they do. And they could -- and should, from the point of view of the 99.9 percent -- be paying substantially more in taxes, not offered even more tax breaks, despite the alleged budget crisis, because of the wonderful things they supposedly do.
Still, don't some of the very rich get that way by producing innovations that are worth far more to the world than the income they receive? Sure, but if you look at who really makes up the 0.1 percent, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that, by and large, the members of the super-elite are overpaid, not underpaid, for what they do.
For who are the 0.1 percent? Very few of them are Steve Jobs-type innovators; most of them are corporate bigwigs and financial wheeler-dealers. One recent analysis found that 43 percent of the super-elite are executives at nonfinancial companies, 18 percent are in finance and another 12 percent are lawyers or in real estate. And these are not, to put it mildly, professions in which there is a clear relationship between someone's income and his economic contribution.
Executive pay, which has skyrocketed over the past generation, is famously set by boards of directors appointed by the very people whose pay they determine; poorly performing C.E.O.'s still get lavish paychecks, and even failed and fired executives often receive millions as they go out the door.
Meanwhile, the economic crisis showed that much of the apparent value created by modern finance was a mirage. As the Bank of England's director for financial stability recently put it, seemingly high returns before the crisis simply reflected increased risk-taking -- risk that was mostly borne not by the wheeler-dealers themselves but either by naive investors or by taxpayers, who ended up holding the bag when it all went wrong. And as he waspishly noted, ''If risk-making were a value-adding activity, Russian roulette players would contribute disproportionately to global welfare.''
So should the 99.9 percent hate the 0.1 percent? No, not at all. But they should ignore all the propaganda about ''job creators'' and demand that the super-elite pay substantially more in taxes.

Previews and Openings
'Bonnie & Clyde' (in previews; opens on Thursday) For many of us, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow will forever have the faces of Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, who starred in Arthur Penn's ageless 1967 movie. But the composer Frank Wildhorn, the lyricist Don Black and the book writer Ivan Menchell look at the outlaw lovers from fresh angles in this new musical, directed by Jeff Calhoun and starring Laura Osnes and Jeremy Jordan. Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)
'The Canterbury Tales Remixed' (in previews; opens on Dec. 4) After applying his spoken-word talents and scratch-mix backup to Darwin in ''The Rap Guide to Evolution,'' the Canadian hip-hop troubadour Baba Brinkman returns with his take on Chaucer, framing his excursion into 14th-century English society with reimaginings of the epic poems ''Gilgamesh'' and ''Beowulf.'' SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Rooney) 
'The Cherry Orchard' (in previews; opens on Dec. 4) Classic Stage Company invariably attracts top-tier actors to its idiosyncratic productions of Chekhov. The ensemble for this latest, directed by Andrei Belgrader, includes John Turturro, Dianne Wiest, Daniel Davis, Alvin Epstein, Josh Hamilton, Roberta Maxwell, Juliet Rylance, Michael Urie and the sisters Elisabeth and Katherine Waterston. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Rooney)
'Close Up Space' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Dec. 19) Comedies about the difficulties of communication are becoming Leigh Silverman's specialty this season. Following her work on ''Chinglish,'' she tackles that subject again in directing the Manhattan Theater Club production of Molly Smith Metzler's play, whose cast includes David Hyde Pierce, Rosie Perez and Michael Chernus. City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Rooney)
'Elective Affinities' (in previews; opens on Dec. 2) How does quality time with Zoe Caldwell in an Upper East Side town house sound? This new site-specific play by David Adjmi (''Stunning'') will provide that pleasure for 30 people an evening. Ms. Caldwell plays the octogenarian wit Alice Hauptmann, who holds court about civilized society over tea and sandwiches at a location to be disclosed to ticket-holders 48 hours before each performance. Sarah Benson directs this collaboration by Soho Rep, Piece by Piece Productions and Rising Phoenix Repertory. The Hauptmann Residence, (212) 352-3101, hauptmannresidence.com. (Rooney)
'Happy Hour' (in previews; opens on Dec. 5) Before he started rubbing shoulders with Woody Allen and Elaine May with ''Relatively Speaking'' on Broadway, the filmmaker Ethan Coen was regularly cooking up one-act comedy trilogies for the Atlantic Theater Company. His third set, again directed by Neil Pepe, appears to be ironically titled given its lineup of an embittered barfly, two lonely young people blind to their mutual compatibility, and a suicidal business traveler. Peter Norton Space at Signature Theater Company, 552 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Lysistrata Jones' (in previews; opens on Dec. 14) Douglas Carter Beane and Lewis Flinn's literally bouncy Aristophanes update transports the sexually withholding women of ancient Greece onto the basketball court of modern-day Athens University. ''It's Your Duty: No More Booty'' becomes the girls' strategy to spur their guys to a win. Directed and choreographed by Dan Knechtges, this Transport Group production graduates from its site-specific Off Broadway run to the big time in a season that so far is light on new musicals. Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Man Who Came to Dinner' (in previews; opens on Dec. 4) Jim Brochu plays the acid-tongued critic Sheridan Whiteside, inconveniently confined to a dreary Midwestern home, with Cady Huffman as his vain actress chum and Joseph R.

'Maple and Vine' (in previews; opens on Dec. 7) Jordan Harrison returns to Playwrights Horizons, where his ''Doris to Darlene'' was presented, with this new play about a couple who have become allergic to their 21st-century lives and find solace in the simpler pleasures of the 1950s. Anne Kauffman directs a five-member ensemble that includes the always-riveting Marin Ireland. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Misterman' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Dec. 4) While ''Batman'' fans continue to speculate as to whether Scarecrow will return in Christopher Nolan's forthcoming ''The Dark Knight Rises,'' the Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who played that role in previous installments, in the meantime will make his American stage debut. He plays a small-town fanatic facing his own judgment day in Enda Walsh's much-lauded solo piece, which is being presented as part of the Imagine Ireland initiative, promoting Irish arts in the United States. St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'Neighbourhood Watch' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Dec. 7) The work of Alan Ayckbourn is a frequent highlight of the annual Brits Off Broadway season. He returns with his 75th play, a comedy about a housing development where theft and vandalism are on the rise and two new residents take action. Mr. Ayckbourn also directed the production, which comes from his longtime home base, the Stephen Joseph Theater in Scarborough, England. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Rooney)
'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever' (in previews; opens on Dec. 11) Daisy Gamble has become David in Michael Mayer's reconceived production of the much-loved but seldom-seen Burton Lane and Alan Jay Lerner musical about a widowed psychiatrist who becomes romantically bewitched by the previous-life incarnation of one of his patients. Peter Parnell wrote the new book for the show, which stars Harry Connick Jr., David Turner and Jessie Mueller. St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Once' (in previews; opens on Dec. 6) The micro-budget 2007 Irish independent film about the romance between two musicians -- one a Dubliner, the other a Czech immigrant -- became a surprise hit and made international music stars (and Oscar-winning songwriters) of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Brought to the stage by the playwright Enda Walsh and the director and the choreographer of ''Black Watch,'' John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett, this musical is being eyed by theater pundits as a potential Broadway entry. It stars Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Rooney)
'Stick Fly' (in previews; opens on Dec. 8) A well-heeled African-American family's mellow weekend on Martha's Vineyard turns tense when two adult sons introduce their girlfriends in Lydia R. Diamond's play. Kenny Leon directs a cast that includes Dule Hill, Mekhi Phifer, Tracie Thoms and Ruben Santiago-Hudson. The Broadway premiere features original music by the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, who is also one of the producers.

'Titus Andronicus' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Dec. 13) The goriest of Shakespeare's tragedies gets the Public Lab treatment in Michael Sexton's staging, with Jay O. Sanders as the Roman general and Stephanie Roth Haberle as the vanquished Goth queen, whose hunger for revenge yields a literal banquet of blood. The cast also includes Rob Campbell, Jacob Fishel, Jennifer Ikeda and Ron Cephas Jones. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
Broadway
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Chinglish' David Henry Hwang's sporadically funny comedy about a bewildered American businessman seeking his fortune in capitalist China is laid out with the frame-by-frame exactness of a comic strip. That means this bilingual production is easy to follow but hard to embrace with enthusiasm. Leigh Silverman directs (2:00). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'An Evening With Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin' The stars of the original Broadway production of ''Evita'' are reunited on the concert stage for an eclectic evening of (mostly) love songs from the musical theater. Both are in fine vocal form, and the show is a must-have ticket for ardent fans, but the repertory is sometimes a fine fit (Stephen Sondheim) and sometimes ill-chosen (Rodgers and Hammerstein) (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
- 'Follies' The Kennedy Center's revival of James Goldman and Stephen Sondheim's musical about a reunion of Ziegfeld-style performers looks back as much in anger as in fondness, and that's what makes it so vibrant. Eric Schaeffer directs an electric cast led by Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein and Ron Raines (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Not a natural song-and-dance man, Daniel Radcliffe tries really, really hard as the amoral hero of this 1961 Frank Loesser musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway' This impossibly talented, impossibly energetic actor practices safe sex like nobody else. His polished song-and-dance show is like a great, guilt-free platonic one-night stand. All he asks is that you love him loving you loving him. It's hard to deny him that (2:00). Broadhurst Theatre, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Mountaintop' Katori Hall's surprisingly thin drama, which won the 2010 Olivier Award, depicts the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Samuel L. Jackson) and his encounter with a feisty motel maid (Angela Bassett). Perhaps best regarded as a comfort play, a nursery-room fable for grownups (1:40). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime five-member cast who expertly elicit the pain and the comfort of blood ties: Stockard Channing, Rachel Griffiths, Stacy Keach, Judith Light and Thomas Sadoski (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Private Lives' Richard Eyre's larky (if unnecessary) revival of Noel Coward's comedy of connubial fisticuffs makes a convincing case for both the pliable talents of Kim Cattrall and the bubbly pleasures forever on tap in this play. Paul Gross is excellent as Ms. Cattrall's partner in domestic demolition (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Relatively Speaking' This slight but mostly enjoyable trio of short plays by Ethan Coen, Elaine May and Woody Allen won't do much to burnish their established reputations, but the show is chock full of nifty shtick. Marlo Thomas delights as a pampered princess with a dead husband in Ms. May's contribution (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold directs a bright cast that includes Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, lincolncenter.org. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
- 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the Apple co-founder's life and vision into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50).

'Asuncion' Jesse Eisenberg plays a confirmed slacker in a bromance with his former African studies professor (Justin Bartha) in this genial wisp of a comedy written by Mr. Eisenberg (1:40). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, rattlestick.org. (Isherwood)
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
- 'Blood and Gifts' J. T. Rogers's drama gives a remarkably lucid and compelling account of how the American and British view of Afghanistan as a vital front in the cold war against the Soviet Union shaped the calamitous recent history of the country. Directed with a steady hand by Bartlett Sher and featuring a first-rate cast, including Jefferson Mays as a British agent right out of a Graham Greene novel (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Burmese Days' George Orwell's first novel, a blistering look at the dwindling days of the British Raj, receives a dutiful but rather sluggish adaptation from the Aya Theater Company of London. The adapter-director, Ryan Kiggell, never stops telling even as he's showing, and the dense text gets the better of several cast members (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Eric Grode)
'Burning' Thomas Bradshaw's repellent, magnetic play -- about rampaging erotic impulses among untalented show people in New York and neo-Nazis in Berlin -- tramples the lines that divide the good, the bad and the plug ugly in art and in life. Scott Elliott directs a brave if uneven cast in an X-rated production guaranteed to divide audiences (2:45). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Cymbeline' The Fiasco Theater's charming production brings lucidity, credibility and gentle magic to Shakespeare's bulky, convoluted tale of star-crossed lovers and schemers in old Britannia, with a multifarious cast of six on a naked stage.

'Dancing at Lughnasa' Charlotte Moore's production falls a little short on atmosphere but works where it counts most, in the spirited performances of the five women playing the poor, unmarriageable Mundy sisters in the fictional Donegal town of Ballybeg in late summer 1936. Two decades after it was first seen, this transporting Tony-winning memory play by the Irish dramatist Brian Friel has lost none of its humanity or delicacy (2:05).

'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career.

'Hand to God' The Devil is a sock puppet in this foul-mouthed, fun-packed play by Robert Askins about the urges that drive good men (and women, and boys) to dirty deeds. Exuberantly performed by a great cast, led by Steven Boyer as a troubled teenager at odds with his id (1:45).

'Queen of the Mist' Michael John LaChiusa's obsessive musical portrait of an obsessive woman -- Anna Edson Taylor, who went over Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1901 -- features beautiful music but suffers from the monotony of monomania.

'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.''

'Silence!

'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs.

'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy.

'The Sugar House at the Edge of the Wilderness' Carla Ching's new play adapts the story of Hansel and Gretel, reimagining the two children as Chinese-born adoptees who have been abandoned by various parental figures in both China and America. After a flirtation with arson, the sister lands in an asylum where she must battle a Nurse Ratched figure and come to terms with her anger. The production tries very, very hard to be profound, but it ends up about as deep as a frying pan (1:30). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, mayitheatre.org.

'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, despite some overamplification. But most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Wild Animals You Should Know' This sticky, licorice-black comedy from Thomas Higgins takes a group of Boy Scouts and their chaperones into the woods to lose and possibly find themselves. The sitcom rhythms of this confused production, directed by Trip Cullman, are undercut by its aspirational tug of moral seriousness (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Ben Brantley)

'How Much Is Enough: Our Values in Question' (closes on Saturday) Heavy on audience participation, this theater-as-encounter-group piece poses a series of questions to viewers about values and expectations. Those questions are often big and unwieldy and, unsurprisingly, they inspire big, sometimes abstract answers. A Foundry Theater production (1:30).

- 'The Judy Show: My Life as a Sitcom' (closes on Sunday) The writer and stand-up comic Judy Gold may not have realized her dream of starring in a sitcom about being a 6-foot-3 Jewish lesbian mother of two on the Upper West Side, but she has squeezed several seasons' worth of wry observations about life, career and family into this consistently funny 80-minute monologue, complete with her own droll spins on some classic television theme tunes. For anyone who misses Mary Richards, Maude, Laverne and Shirley, the Bradys, the Partridges and other familiar faces that populated small screens in decades past (primarily the 1970s, but the late '60s, the '80s and the early '90s also get a look), this will be better than an uninterrupted evening of YouTube indulgence (1:20).

'Man and Boy' (closes on Sunday) When Frank Langella plays good, he's fine; but when he's bad, he's a wonder. Here the actor who starred as Dracula and Nixon is charismatically amoral as a 1930s financier who wreaks havoc with other people's money. He is also the one compelling reason to see this revival of Terence Rattigan's 1963 drama, directed by Maria Aitken (2:15).

HEADLINE: After Nearly 9 Years of War, Too Many Widows

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Yasir Ghazi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Noria Khalaf giggled and then, embarrassed, covered her smile with a fold of her black robes. Yes, she said, she would like to marry again. It had been four years since her husband died, and her children needed a father.
Finding a good man in Baghdad these days is a challenge. Not only is nearly every trailer in this dusty government-run camp on the capital's outskirts occupied by war widows like her, with nary a man in sight, but across Iraq women now outnumber men. 
Some widows ask their brothers to bring friends by the camp, one of two packed trailer camps for widows in Baghdad. But that is not often successful.
The problem is that widows do not make appealing brides, say the women themselves and nongovernmental organizations that assist them.
''Maybe a young woman with only one or two kids can marry again,'' Ms. Khalaf said with a sigh; she has six children.
Widows are not a new social problem in Iraq, of course. The war with Iran in the 1980s left tens of thousands of women widowed. Each new calamity that followed created more: the 1991 war with the United States, the failed Shiite uprising that followed, the repressions against Kurds.
And the numbers of widows in Iraq, or as American aid programs prefer to call them, ''female heads of households,'' increased substantially after the invasion in 2003 and in the years of violence that followed.
The Iraqi Ministry of Planning estimates that about 9 percent of the country's women, or about 900,000, are widows. A separate government agency, the Ministry of Women, issued a statement in June putting the figure at one million.
Other groups also have estimated the number of women widowed during the nearly nine-year war, which is drawing to an official close with the last American soldiers scheduled to leave in December.
A United Nations report estimated that at the peak of the sectarian violence in 2006, nearly 100 women were widowed each day. The Ministry of Social Affairs pays widow's benefits to 86,000 women, most of whom, it says, lost their husbands in the latest war.
This figure corresponds with conservative estimates of 103,000 to 113,000 Iraqi deaths in the war, according to a nonprofit group that tallies casualties, Iraq Body Count. The count includes the estimated 10,000 Iraqi soldiers who died in the initial American-led invasion and 10,125 police officers and soldiers who died afterward in fighting with insurgents, along with those killed in sectarian violence.
In possibly one of the last such episodes of the war, last weekend, the Iraqi police said American troops shot and killed two civilians after a roadside bomb exploded near a convoy. The American military denied that soldiers had fired on civilians.
Confronted with so many widows, the Iraqi government is providing only minimal assistance, equivalent to about $80 a month to those widowed in the recent conflict.
''We expected we would get a lot of help from all sides, the Americans, the Iraqi government,'' Ms. Khalaf, who lost her husband in 2007, said in an interview in her trailer. ''But the fact is, nobody really cares about us.''
The rusting trailer camp, across from a car lot, represents a social challenge that is not easily remedied -- not least because the gender imbalance makes it exceedingly unlikely most widows will remarry.
Some American-financed projects have sought to help widows become self-sufficient economically, with some success, according to program reports. A United States Agency for International Development program offers small grants to female heads of households, for example. They can use the money to open small businesses like beauty salons or catering services. Program administrators say many recipients not only have improved their lives materially, but have overcome depression.
The program noted ailments among widows, some of whom had witnessed the killings of their husbands, like difficulty concentrating, numbness and heart palpitations. But after the widows started a small business, the program administrators said, they noticed signs of improvement -- ''more colorful clothing, smiley faces and for some, louder voices as they speak.''
At the trailer camp, American soldiers used to drive by occasionally in their Humvees, to throw candy and soccer balls to the children, a meager help.
At times, war widows became symbols for opponents of the American military presence in Iraq. When an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at President George W. Bush in 2008, he shouted that he was doing so on behalf of the war's widows and orphans. Politicians have recruited widows to appear at political rallies. But a half a dozen widows interviewed at the trailer camp said, most of all, they would like to remarry, however unlikely.
In the meantime, Raja Hashim, 32, said she would focus on her children, all sons. ''I don't need a man because I have three men already,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Workers Feeling Squeezed by the N.B.A. Lockout

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
NEWARK -- For nearly five months, David Stern and Derek Fisher have been the public faces of the N.B.A. lockout. As the league's commissioner and the president of the players union, they have dueled across the negotiating table and in front of the television cameras while struggling to forge a new collective bargaining agreement.
But lost in the stalemate over how to divide the league's $4 billion in revenue are the thousands of ticket-takers, security guards, ushers and concessionaires who rely on the income they earn at N.B.A. arenas. A majority of them work part time to supplement a day job or a spouse's income, to fortify a college savings account or simply to cover bills or pay for Christmas gifts. 
Most of the work is unglamorous, the benefits slim and the wages often only a few dollars above the hourly minimum. Yet they cannot recoup the money they would have earned at the games that have been canceled through mid-December. While the league and players are talking again, so much time has elapsed that the league may be able to hold only an abbreviated 66-game season, and only if the two sides reach a deal in the next week or so.
''When the Nets were here, they helped me pay bills with whatever money I earned, especially around the holiday season,'' said Scott Gold, who supervises ushers at Prudential Center, where the Nets have a two-year lease. ''I wish they were here, not just for me, but all my co-workers.''
Gold, 40, makes a few dollars more an hour than the ushers he keeps an eye on, and he hustles for his money. On days when there are events at Prudential Center, he works from 7 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at a day-care center near his home in Irvington, N.J. In the late afternoon, he picks up his uniform, which includes a white shirt, black jacket and red tie, at a staff cloak room. He then checks a posted schedule to see which dozen or so co-workers he will oversee.
Even at Prudential Center, the sixth-busiest arena in the country, the work can be spotty. In the fall and the winter at home, the Devils play a few preseason games and 41 regular-season games, with more home games if they qualify for the N.H.L. playoffs. But they also go on the road for long stretches. Seton Hall's basketball team plays in Newark, but the crowds are smaller and the schedule shorter. Disney on Ice and an array of concerts fill the rest of the calendar.
In November, there are 16 events scheduled. But the operators of Prudential Center cannot easily make up for the lost N.B.A. games because they were canceled on such short notice, and arranging concerts -- which can earn more than basketball games -- takes months.
During the summer, the schedule thins, too, and despite his seniority, Gold does not work every event because his bosses try to make sure the 1,400 part-time workers at the arena have enough dates.
''I'm still struggling even working day care,'' said Gold, who is trying to save money for his teenage daughter's college tuition.
Louise Connors, an usher who lives in Bayonne, N.J., and does five-hour shifts at the fragrance counter at Macy's before coming to the arena, will also miss the income from Nets games.
''Forty-two games of basketball, that's a lot of money you don't really have,'' she said, adding that she would spend less on gifts this Christmas. ''We can't get this money back.''
The Nets have been something of a windfall for the part-timers and others. The team moved to Prudential Center last year for the first of two seasons in Newark, but plans to decamp next year for Brooklyn, where its new home is being built. Still, Gold and his co-workers said they were happy for the extra half-dozen home games a month when the N.B.A. was playing.
''I have a culinary certificate, maintenance experience and a server's license, but I'm still looking for a second job,'' said Darrell Welch, 21, who lives in Newark and has worked as an usher for three years. ''I'm doing what I can to save for college.''
The workers in the arena are not the only ones affected. Without games, office supply companies sell less paper and toner, sanitation companies have less trash to haul and advertisers have fewer campaigns to market. Restaurants nearby serve fewer patrons, too.
Brian Karwoski, the owner of Brick City Bar and Grill, which is across the street from the arena, said he typically adds another dozen workers when there are events. Without Nets games, he is freer to schedule holiday parties. But because the N.B.A. has been canceling games several weeks at a time, it is hard to plan ahead.
Tom Blume, the general manager down the street at the Edison Ale House, said he triples his staff on nights when there are events at the arena, and gets an influx of out-of-town fans when the Devils or the Nets play teams from Philadelphia, New York and other cities nearby.
To Deborah Dutra, one of the waitresses employed by Blume, the extra income from Nets games would be significant. Three times a week, she pays a babysitter $50 to care for her two children so she can work. She also must pay for train fare and share her tips with co-workers. When there was no event at the arena one day this week, she took home only $45.
''When we have events, it's great,'' she said. ''But we're set back now, which is a really bad thing.''
Set against the construction of two new hotels and hundreds of residential units in Newark, the impact of the lost N.B.A. games will be negligible to the city's overall economy, said Adam Zipkin, the deputy mayor for economic development. Newark has also shown it can host an N.B.A. team, which makes it is more likely to attract another professional team in the future, he added.
But on an individual level, the loss of N.B.A. games hurts.
''A lot of those workers are Newark residents,'' Zipkin said. ''There are certainly less nights and fewer shifts, so it's definitely a pinch.''

HEADLINE: Rival Palestinian Leaders Meet but Fail to End Rift

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER and FARES AKRAM; Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Fares Akram from Gaza.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and the leader of the rival Islamic group Hamas met Thursday and the sides agreed to go ahead with elections in the Palestinian territories next year, according to officials, even as they failed to resolve differences over an interim unity government to prepare for the vote.
The meeting, in Cairo, was the first between Mr. Abbas, chief of the mainstream Fatah movement, and his rival, Khaled Meshal, the political leader of Hamas, since the two men signed a reconciliation accord in May. Even since then, the leadership of the Palestinian territories has remained divided, with Mr. Abbas's authority confined to the West Bank while Hamas controls the coastal enclave of Gaza. 
It remained unclear even after the meeting on Thursday whether the two sides were indeed committed to a further narrowing of their differences, and whether they would take any tangible steps toward power sharing soon or at all.
The May accord, brokered by Egypt, called for a transitional unity cabinet of unaffiliated technocrats to prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections within a year. Despite rosy public statements after their meeting on Thursday, the two men remained deadlocked over the makeup of that government, according to officials.
Mr. Abbas has insisted on retaining Salam Fayyad, an American-educated economist who is well regarded internationally, as prime minister. Hamas rejected that plan. Both sides insisted on Thursday that their differences were being ironed out and said they would meet again starting Dec. 20.
''We discussed all the details about reconciliation and would like to tell you that there are no differences between us at all on any of the issues,'' Mr. Abbas told reporters after the meeting. ''You will see all of this in the coming days and weeks.''
Mr. Meshal, who is based in Damascus, Syria, said that the atmosphere was positive. ''With this meeting we have opened a new page of a high level of understanding,'' he said.
Neither of the leaders directly addressed the deadlock over the appointment of a unity government.
Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, said by telephone from Cairo that the sides had agreed to continue the discussions in committees. Azzam al-Ahmad of Fatah said that consultations would continue and that Mr. Abbas and Mr. Meshal would meet again to determine the makeup of the government and other issues.
But differences between the sides clearly prevailed, and since the signing of the accord disincentives for further cooperation have mounted.
Hamas rejects Israel's existence and is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union and Israel. Israel and the West say they will not deal with a Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless the Islamic group recognizes Israel, renounces violence and accepts all previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
Hamas has shown no sign of agreeing to those conditions, and the prospect of a unity government threatens the Palestinian Authority's relations with Israel, Europe and the United States. It also jeopardizes its finances. Israeli officials have withheld the transfer of about $100 million a month in taxes and customs duties that Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians, in part waiting to see the outcome of the latest unity talks. Meanwhile, for Hamas, the Arab Spring has buoyed hopes of new opportunities for Islamist parties across the region.
The hostility and distrust between Fatah and Hamas continues to run deep. Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006, forcing Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority and controls the presidency and much of the government and security services, to share power with it for the first time. The two formed a national unity government that did not hold for long. After a short but bloody factional war in Gaza, Hamas routed Fatah officials from the coastal enclave, confining Mr. Abbas and his authority to the West Bank.
This latest effort to present a unified front comes as peace efforts with Israel have stalled. Mr. Abbas's recent bid for full membership for Palestine at the United Nations has also faltered. United Nations Security Council members are concerned, among other things, about whether the Palestinians qualify as a state when Mr. Abbas has no control over Gaza.
Hamas received at least a temporary lift from its recent prisoner swap with Israel, in which the Islamic militant group exchanged one captive Israeli soldier for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. But Hamas remains isolated in Gaza, and the upheaval in Syria has made the Hamas leadership's base there precarious.
Mr. Barhoum said that the two sides agreed to some confidence-building measures, like stopping politically motivated arrests, and that they had also reached understandings on a political program defining relations between Israel and the Palestinians and the shape of a future Palestinian state. He did not elaborate on the content of those understandings.

HEADLINE: Support Builds for a Plan To Rein In Medicare Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Though it reached no agreement, the special Congressional committee on deficit reduction built a case for major structural changes in Medicare that would limit the government's open-ended financial commitment to the program, lawmakers and health policy experts say.
Members of both parties told the panel that Medicare should offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to buy coverage from competing private plans, whose costs and benefits would be tightly regulated by the government.
Republicans have long been enamored of that idea. In the last few weeks, two of the Republican candidates for president, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, have endorsed variations of it.
The idea faces opposition from many Democrats, who say it would shift costs to beneficiaries and eliminate the guarantee of affordable health insurance for older Americans. But some Democrats say that -- if carefully designed, with enough protections for beneficiaries -- it might work. 
The idea is sometimes known as premium support, because Medicare would subsidize premiums charged by private insurers that care for beneficiaries under contract with the government.
''This is an idea that could easily resurface in the future as Congress seeks additional Medicare savings for deficit reduction,'' said Patricia H. Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Even though the deficit committee failed, its work may frame the debate over Medicare, taxes and other issues in the 2012 election year and beyond.
John C. Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care, which represents consumers, employers and providers, said, ''The supercommittee may have laid the groundwork for future reductions in the growth of Medicare.''
Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the ranking Republican on the committee, frequently quoted a statement by President Obama: ''The major driver of our long-term liabilities, everybody here knows, is Medicare and Medicaid and our health care spending. Nothing comes close.''
Medicare is likely to remain at the center of the nation's long-term debt crisis through 2030, when more than 80 million people will be on Medicare, according to federal estimates.
Alice M. Rivlin, who was budget director for President Bill Clinton, had urged the deficit panel to establish an insurance exchange for Medicare beneficiaries. Private plans would compete with the traditional Medicare program and would have to provide at least the same benefits. The federal contribution in each region would be based on the cost of the second-cheapest option, whether that was a private plan or traditional Medicare.
Mr. Obama's health care law provides ''premium support'' for people below age 65. The government will offer subsidies, in the form of tax credits, to help people buy coverage marketed by private carriers on an insurance exchange.
If this approach works for commercial insurance under the new law, it could allay concerns about similar changes to Medicare.
Competition among private insurers has already driven down costs for prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Medicare's drug benefit is delivered entirely by private insurers. In addition, one-fourth of the 48 million Medicare beneficiaries are in private Medicare Advantage plans, offered by companies like UnitedHealth and Humana, which cover a wide range of doctors' services and hospital care.
The new health care law is cutting payments to Medicare Advantage plans. Republican lawmakers predicted that the cuts would lead insurers to increase premiums, reduce benefits or pull out of the program. But so far the dire predictions have not been borne out.
On average, the Obama administration said recently, Medicare Advantage premiums will be 4 percent lower in 2012 than in 2011, and insurers expect their Medicare enrollment to increase by 10 percent.
Throughout the deficit reduction talks, Democrats insisted that any package be balanced. They entertained the idea of restructuring Medicare as part of a large deficit reduction package that also included tax increases. They repeatedly described the budget as a moral document and said they would not balance the budget on the backs of older Americans, children and poor people.
Democrats gave no indication that they would accept major Medicare changes in the absence of tax increases.
But other ways of reining in Medicare costs carry their own political risks. Mr. Obama discussed one such proposal -- gradually increasing the age of eligibility for Medicare -- as part of a budget deal that he tried to negotiate over the summer with Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio.
Mr. Obama is counting on a new agency, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, to ensure a sharp reduction in the growth of Medicare spending per beneficiary. But he has not nominated anyone to run the agency, which Republicans denounce as a tool for rationing care.
Democrats sharply criticized the budget blueprint approved in April by the House, under which new beneficiaries would receive a fixed amount of money from Medicare to help pay premiums for private insurance policies.
A report on that proposal by the Congressional Budget Office provided ammunition to its critics. ''Under the proposal,'' the report says, ''most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system,'' and some would choose not to buy coverage, so ''the number of older Americans without health insurance would be higher.''
Health policy experts said these problems resulted from specific features of the House Republican plan and were not necessarily inherent in the idea of ''premium support.'' Medicare, they said, could move toward ''premium support'' without destroying the individual entitlement at the heart of the program.
The House Republicans' budget plan would eventually eliminate traditional Medicare as an option for new beneficiaries. Ms. Rivlin would keep it as an option, competing directly with private insurers.
Under the House Republican plan, the federal contribution would be increased each year to reflect the age of a beneficiary and general inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index. But health costs and insurance premiums have been rising faster than consumer prices in general, so the federal contribution was almost guaranteed to fall behind the cost of insurance.
As an alternative, the federal contribution could be set at a percentage of the premium charged by a private plan, or the lowest-cost plans, or it could reflect the average premium for all plans in an area. Beneficiaries could keep some or all of the difference if they chose a plan costing less than the federal payment, and they would have to pay more if they chose a more expensive plan.
Because the deficit reduction panel failed to reach agreement, the government is supposed to make across-the-board cuts in spending, starting in 2013. The new budget law says that Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and health plans cannot be reduced more than 2 percent in any year.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the automatic cuts will trim $123 billion from Medicare over 10 years. But since the cost of the program is still expected to total more than $7 trillion in those years, lawmakers are likely to continue the frantic search for savings.

HEADLINE: The Solyndra Mess

 BODY:
The Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee appear to have hit the pause button on their investigation into the failure of Solyndra, a solar panel maker that entered bankruptcy proceedings in September, defaulting on a $528 million federal loan.
What have we learned? Nobody comes out of this looking good. Not the Obama administration, which appears to have misread the market in its eagerness to proclaim that it was creating green jobs. Not the Republicans, either, as their partisanship turned a legitimate inquiry into a circus of broad accusations aimed more at tarnishing the administration than contributing to a serious discussion of energy policy. 
The Republicans hoped to prove that the Solyndra loan was a political favor to wealthy investors with Democratic ties, chiefly George Kaiser, an Oklahoma billionaire. They have not made this case. There were plenty of other private investors, some of them Republicans. In sworn testimony to the committee, Steven Chu, the energy secretary, denied knowing who Mr. Kaiser was when he signed off on the loan in September 2009 and said it had been ''made only on the merits.''
Nor have the Republicans succeeded in showing President Obama's green energy strategy to be a flop. About 40 projects have received loans under a clean energy program authorized by Congress in 2005 and incorporated in the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus package. Only two have failed, Solyndra and Beacon Power, a battery company in upstate New York that borrowed $39 million. These defaults represent just 1.3 percent of the $37.6 billion loan portfolio. The biggest bet to date is an $8.33 billion loan guarantee for a nuclear plant in Georgia.
Even so, the hearings have raised legitimate questions about the Solyndra deal. Solyndra was the first beneficiary of the loan program and seemed to be an ideal candidate -- a company with a new technology and lots of venture capital -- for an administration eager to show results. So eager, in fact, that the White House appeared willing to ignore warnings from its own experts about rising competition in the solar panel market. E-mail exchanges released by Republicans from August 2009, as the loan neared approval, show that some officials in the Office of Management and Budget were beginning to worry that Chinese companies could threaten Solyndra's sales with cheaper units; one official asked that ''the announcement be postponed.'' But those worries were dismissed, and the loan announcement went ahead as planned.
Those fears were not unfounded. By May 2010, when President Obama visited the company to trumpet green energy, the market had weakened and Solyndra was showing cracks. Yet the White House remained deeply invested in Solyndra's success; according to one e-mail from an investor quoted by the Republicans, it asked the company to delay announcing layoffs until after the November 2010 elections. Given Solyndra's prominence, layoffs would obviously have been embarrassing.
One other issue involves Mr. Chu's decision to subordinate Solyndra's loan to a new round of private financing last February, allowing private investors to move ahead of taxpayers in the event of a default. Republicans say this was illegal, but Mr. Chu says he had been assured by the loan program's chief counsel that it was proper because new financing was essential to keep the company solvent.
Last month, the White House asked Herbert Allison Jr., a former assistant Treasury secretary, to undertake a 60-day review of the loan program and assess the health of other companies that received loans. The Republican inquiry has raised valid questions, but it has also unfairly tried to exploit one bad bet to discredit public investments in renewable technologies. As the investigations continue, Congress must not lose sight of the bigger picture: the need to invest in promising alternatives to fossil fuels.

HEADLINE: In a Nervous Market, Gold Finds New Fans

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Byron Wien, the investment strategist, has been forecasting the future for decades. But this is the first year that he has officially recommended gold in his model portfolio.
And at the beginning of this month, Mr. Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners, said he was maintaining his 5 percent allocation to gold for next year.
The metal has become the insurance policy of choice for many sophisticated investors. Even among those who were never gold bugs, there is now a belief that it has its place in a portfolio. 
Mr. Wien's view comes despite the fact that gold, which was up 29.5 percent in 2010, was up an additional 20.7 percent at the end of October of this year, according to Mr. Wien's most recent report -- nearly double the increase for real estate, the second-highest increase among Mr. Wien's recommended asset classes.
His decision to continue recommending gold comes even while some investors feel that after such a steep run, prices may fall. The returns reflect the hard reality that as governments print money, thereby debasing the value of their currencies, gold still looks like a sensible option.
''The money supply will be expanded in the major currencies in the developed world, and investors will seek the protection of hard assets: something real, and gold is perceived as real,'' Mr. Wien said by telephone.
Is he expecting gold to continue its astonishing ascent? There are reasons to doubt that it will. For example, the dollar has rallied as fears of problems in the euro zone have grown. Often that increase forecasts a drop in gold value, since deterioration in currency values suggests higher gold prices.
That does not change Mr. Wien's view. ''You don't buy insurance because you think you will have a fire or a flood,'' he said. ''You buy it and you hope you don't collect on it.''
Even the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has been watching the price of gold as an index of investor confidence in the future. ''I think the reason people hold gold is as a protection against what we call 'tail risk' -- really, really bad outcomes,'' Mr. Bernanke said at a hearing in July before the U.S. Congress. ''To the extent that the last few years have made people more worried abut the potential of a major crisis, then they have gold as a protection.''
Sounds logical, right? And yet gold is a controversial investment.
''Gold is even more speculative than real estate,'' said Fran Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. ''At least with housing, you have the income from rents. With gold there is no income at all. Gold does not pay dividends or interest, so the only thing you get is the price differential. It has benefited from many months of flight-to-safety flows that can crash at any moment.
''The fundamental underpinnings are so shaky that I have no confidence whatsoever that any so-called relationship between the price of gold and anything else is a stable relationship,'' Mr. Kinniry said.
Even so, as the Italian and Greek governments fail to resolve their problems, gold looks particularly attractive because, with the dollar, it is considered a safe harbor in times of such uncertainty.
''Gold is a money that governments don't print,'' said Charles Stevenson, a private investor who first bought gold during the inflation of the 1970s and continues to own gold today, although he has traded in and out along the way.
''It's a way to hold value when there is nothing to invest in because it stores value the way money is supposed to, '' he said. ''If you hold your assets in money, inflation now exceeds interest rates, and the government is draining purchasing power.''
The situation is sufficiently volatile that Gary Brinson, a veteran strategist and scholar who runs the Brinson Foundation, agrees that gold, even at its currently high price, may have a small place as insurance.
''You can get into windows of time where gold will act as a counterweight in an otherwise asset-based portfolio,'' he said. ''The problem is that if you pay too much for it, its ability to offset the inflationary effect is diminished.''
As recently as a month ago, gold fell drastically, surprising and worrying investors. ''There are caveats,'' Mr. Stevenson said. ''In a bad world, gold won't necessarily maintain its value. If real estate drops in half and gold drops a quarter, for example, you can sell gold and buy twice as much real estate.''
What makes the situation particularly complicated today is that the easiest vehicle for average investors who want to hold gold are gold exchange-traded funds. They are volatile because you can buy them on margin, and that attracts speculative buyers.
There are wild cards, too. People who need money sell the assets that can be sold. ''If you invested in John Corzine's MF Global and you needed to sell those assets, you couldn't do it,'' Mr. Stevenson said. ''There is always a bidder for gold, just like there are always bidders for top-quality real estate, but there might not be bidders for B-quality real estate.''
Certainly there were historical periods when gold was a bad bet. It was a disappointing holding between 1980 and 2000, when other assets were growing in value. As interest rates declined, any company in which one invested could refinance, making it a benign environment to use cash for other investments.
But James Grant, who has a newsletter, remains bullish despite the hiccups because he believes that the ''central banks -- north, south east and west -- have gotten out of the central banking business and into the central planning business, meaning that they are devoted to raising up: if they can; economic growth and employment through the dubious means of suppressing interest rates and printing money. The nice thing about gold is that you can't print it.''
Having said that, Mr. Grant acknowledges that when gold fell 50 percent in 2008, 'it certainly tested confidence,'' he said. But he simply does not believe that, for now, bankers can see into the future and improve things.

HEADLINE: Week 12 Matchups: Something's Happening Here

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: When not losing convincingly to good teams, the Browns challenge the devotion and attention span of fans everywhere by wasting whole afternoons in slow-motion tug-of-wars. Will that happen again against the Bengals? 

 BODY:
Browns (4-6) at Bengals (6-4)
The Talking Heads once sang that heaven is a place where nothing ever happens. Heaven, then, is a Browns game, a nonevent between moribund teams with few recognizable stars that ends in a 6-3, 13-12, or 14-10 final score. When not losing convincingly to good teams, the Browns challenge the devotion and attention span of fans everywhere by wasting whole afternoons in slow-motion tugs of war against fellow thrill ascetics. It takes real work to comb through the game tape and play-by-play of an entire Browns-Jaguars game, only to discover that the only quasi-interesting story lines are questions about whether a 38-yard field goal sailed just inside the right upright (it didn't) or if Jack Del Rio could explain the final Jaguars play call that gave the Browns a victory (he couldn't).
Bengals games, by contrast, are full of action. The Bengals catch bombs and allow bombs. Andy Dalton completes incredible passes and attempts ill-conceived option pitches on the same drive. Defenders tackle receivers by pulling their hair. Pacman Jones has been on the roster for weeks and has done nothing loopy yet, which means that he is due. The Bengals are just good enough to lose to the Ravens and the Steelers, but they are a cut above the teams that get trapped in the Browns' tar pits. The Bengals' 27-17 victory at Cleveland in Week 1 will repeat itself, if only because the Browns are too boring to try something new. Pick: Bengals.
Patriots (7-3) at Eagles (4-6)
Our current national delusion is the belief that a quarterback whose team scores 17 points (7 as the result of defensive or special teams play) against a New York opponent, but who leads a grinding fourth-quarter game-winning drive, has done something truly exceptional. So there's a (yawn) quarterback controversy brewing in Philadelphia, the City of Backup Quarterback-ly Love. If Michael Vick (ribs) is healthy, he will start over Vince Young, though locals are clamoring for Young, whose three early-game interceptions were apparently not signs of ineptitude but his flair for the dramatic. Meanwhile, DeSean Jackson's self-promoting behavior has become so erratic and counterproductive that he is one step from renaming the rest of his season the Torpedo of Touchdowns Tour.
The Patriots, meanwhile, continue their creepy public self-flagellation for not going undefeated every single year. "We're going to need to play better than we did offensively tonight if we want to start making some serious improvements down the stretch," said Tom Brady, whose team won its last two games by a combined score of 71-19 and has a two-game division lead. "I don't think we're really where we hoped to be at this point." After three-plus years, quotes like these sound less like reasonable self-criticism and more like compliment fishing. Pick: Patriots.
Buccaneers (4-6) at Titans (5-5)
LaGarrette Blount showed off his World of Warcraft tanking ability in a 54-yard touchdown run against the Packers last week, holding aggro and using his Sunder Armor ability to plow through Packers defenders like so many gravelsnout kobolds. Blount's venture into Azeroth was a mixed blessing for the Buccaneers, however, as Blount and his teammates began trying to leap over or charge through every opponent they saw. By the end of the game, Kellen Winslow attempted to hurdle a defender who was standing perfectly upright; as all buffs had long worn off by then, he missed his goal of a seven-foot high jump by about four and a half feet. This can all be interpreted as a metaphor for the Buccaneers' inability to achieve their high expectations, but something was lost in the translation from Elven.
Matt Hasselbeck (arm) keeps reassembling himself and staggering back onto the field. Jake Locker should hire some James Brown backup singers to throw a gold cape over him and lead him to the tunnel. It has been known to work the fourth or fifth time. Pick: Buccaneers.
Bears (7-3) at Raiders (6-4)
Jay Cutler has taken some criticism for not playing through injuries in the past, which is why he should consider wearing a protective walking boot on his thumb. With Cutler out up to two months, Caleb Hanie is the Bears' quarterback. Lovie Smith knows how to win despite substandard quarterbacking - the Bears reached the Super Bowl with Rex Grossman, after all - but Hanie's presence threatens to upset the balance of power in both the N.F.C. North and the A.F.C. West. The Bears face the Raiders, the Chiefs and the Broncos in the next three weeks. If Hanie starts out hot thanks to a custom game plan, then fades, he could facilitate further Tim Tebow magic and catapult the Broncos into first place. If he starts slowly, then adjusts, he can help the Raiders pull away. If he just hands off to Matt Forte and waits for the Bears' defense and special teams to bail the offense out, not only can he keep the Bears in the playoff picture while muddying the A.F.C. West waters, but he will also secure a Redskins starting job in about three years. Pick: Raiders.
Texans (7-3) at Jaguars (3-7)
The loss of quarterback Matt Schaub will not cripple the Texans too badly if they follow the following guidelines for getting through the season. 1.) Limit Matt Leinart's decision making, right down to ordering his meals for him and making him choose his wardrobe using Garanimals. 2.) Give the Arian Foster-Ben Tate run-heavy offense a cool nickname, like Foster the People or Ben-10 Arian Force. Or something that's actually catchy. 3.) Cut blocking will now involve chain saws. 4.) Continue to play in the A.F.C. South, where Leinart is one more Matt Hasselbeck ice pack from being the best quarterback in the division. Pick: Texans.
Panthers (2-8) at Colts (0-10)
Before the Colts decided that Curtis Painter would start again, there was the possibility that they would have two players (quarterback Dan Orlovsky and running back Donald Brown) in their backfield from the University of Connecticut. Next, they can grab some receivers from Georgetown and build an offensive line around players from Gonzaga and Butler; it's not really a stretch for a team that drafted guard Ben Ijalana from Villanova. Install some hard wood, change the name of Lucas Oil Stadium to the Hoosier Dome II, and the Colts can win back the love of hoops-crazy Indianans. Orlovsky also briefly helmed the 0-16 Detroit Lions in 2008; with his basketball-school background, his next step should be a stint with the Washington Generals. Pick: Panthers.
Vikings (2-8) at Falcons (6-4)
Adrian Peterson (sprained ankle) is out indefinitely, so we have provided this suggested breakdown for carving up his substantial workload. Toby Gerhart, 50 percent of Peterson's carries: when you need 4 yards, Gerhart can get you 4 yards. And when you need 20 yards, Gerhart can get you an old football cliche. Percy Harvin, 20 percent: in today's N.F.L. sticking an injury-prone receiver in the backfield and asking him to carry the ball eight times per game sounds like a downright viable tactic. Christian Ponder, 20 percent: the rookie quarterback is pretty darned fast, and because the Vikings have no good receivers except Harvin (who is now a part-time running back), Ponder would just be forced to scramble if he dropped to pass, anyway. Lorenzo Booker, 5 percent: Booker is a postmodernist runner, a quick jitterbug with no speed or moves. If you need 4 yards, Booker can run to the sideline and fetch Gerhart. Ryan Longwell, 5 percent: long snapper Cullen Loeffler is trying to play through a shoulder injury, increasing the odds that a ball will wind up in the hands of Longwell, the 37-year old kicker, who can get you 4 yards if you need 3 points. Pick: Falcons.
Bills (5-5) at Jets (5-5)
Two weeks ago, Mark Sanchez called a timeout before halftime that gave the Patriots ample time to march downfield and score a touchdown. On Thursday, Sanchez opted to throw a quick screen to Dustin Keller instead of stopping the clock in the waning seconds before halftime. Rex Ryan called the former decision "stupid" - as opposed to an all-out blitz near the end zone against a scrambling quarterback whose own coach admits cannot throw, which was sheer genius - but Sanchez is really just a misused resource. He should be handed the ball with 30 seconds left before halftime and asked questions about the economy, foreign policy, philosophy, you name it. Once he makes his decision, we can all do the opposite. The Jets may suffer, but it is a small price to pay. Pick: Jets.
Cardinals (3-7) at Rams (2-8)
According to Matt Maiocco of Comcast Bay Area, the 49ers never rushed more than four defenders against the Cardinals in last week's 23-7 victory. The Cardinals faced a three-man rush six times and a four-man rush 31 times; there were zone blitzes, with a linebacker or cornerback rushing while a lineman dropped into coverage, but the 49ers essentially spent the whole game backing up and waiting for the Cardinals to come to them. The Cardinals never arrived. Not blitzing (in the conventional sense) is the first step toward not game-planning against the Cardinals, then not sending the starters to road games and finally figuring that the Cardinals' offense is so bad that your defense can probably beat them via conference calls and Skype. The Rams recorded two safeties against this offense just three weeks ago, yet still lost, which tells you all you need to know about their offense. Pick: Rams.
Redskins (3-7) at Seahawks (4-6)
Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall's play has slipped so badly that even Hall has finally noticed. "I can't point a finger at anybody but myself," he said after giving up more than his standard allotment of big plays against the Cowboys. "The way I'm playing right now, they need to go cut me, because I'm definitely not worth what I'm getting." Hall is on to something: perhaps a ritual sacrifice of a pure example of an overpaid, discontented employee can appease the angry Invisible Hand of Macroeconomics and end the recession! We can erect a ziggurat in Landover, where Dan Snyder can reach into Hall's breast pocket, tear out his still-redeemable paycheck, show it to the crowd and toss it onto a hibachi as Hall crumples into a penitent heap. The ceremony can be performed once the Redskins return from Seattle, where the Seahawks remain dangerous to cross-country travelers: they upset the Ravens two weeks ago, and their defense is playing well enough to stop an opponent that manages to appear jet-lagged during home games. Pick: Seahawks.
Broncos (5-5) at Chargers (4-6)
The Broncos' defense has been exceptional in the last two weeks, allowing just 23 points while scoring seven on an interception return Tebow. The rookie Von Miller has nine and a half sacks Tebow, Elvis Dumervil has played his way back into form after a chest injury erased his 2010 season Tebow and linebackers D.\x80\xB9J. Tebow and Joe Mays have made an impact in the Tebow of the field. The Broncos special Tebows are also playing well. Norv Tebow is facing heavy crititebow in San Ditebow, and could lose his Tebow if Tebow Tebow Tebow soon. Pick: Tebow.
Steelers (7-3) at Chiefs (4-6)
Ben Roethlisberger is one of many N.F.L. quarterbacks dealing with thumb and finger issues. Roethlisberger practiced this week with a splint under a protective glove: any more padding and structure on his right hand, and Roethlisberger could have joined the cast of the Muppets. Big Ben also worked exclusively from the shotgun so he would not have to feel the force of Maurkice Pouncey's direct snap. Roethlisberger should not put himself through all of this trouble against a team that has scored a total of 16 points in three weeks and is starting a quarterback who could not crack the lineups of the Montreal Alouettes and the California Redwoods. Charlie Batch's purpose in life is to outduel the Tyler Palkos of the world, but the tight A.F.C. North race has the Steelers unwilling to take any chances. Pick: Steelers.
Giants (6-4) at Saints (7-3)
Dear Steve Weatherford,
It has come to my attention that you sometimes punt the football straight into the arms of the league's most dangerous return men, forcing me to constrict and temporarily hinder blood flow to the brain. This week, you will be facing Darren Sproles, who has five total return touchdowns in his career. Please be advised that if he scores a touchdown as a direct result of one of your punts, I will shut down, then leap through the esophagus to strangle you, leaving you breathless and unemployed faster than you can say "Matt Dodge."
Sincerely,
Tom Coughlin's Pulmonary Artery.
Pick: Saints.

HEADLINE: The Supreme Court and Health Care

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama has not made the strongest arguments possible for his health-insurance law, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
For decades Americans have been served, in the print media and on television, with sorry vignettes of fellow Americans who have seen their health-insurance premiums increased or lost their insurance coverage altogether because illness struck or were denied coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions. 
As a result, these Americans may find themselves hounded by bill collectors on behalf of the doctors and hospitals who treated them. One major illness can wipe out their lifetime savings, house included.
Sometime in 2012, probably just before its current term ends at the end of June, the Supreme Court will decide whether Americans will just have to live with that problem, or, alternatively, like citizens in virtually any other industrialized country, they will have the right to have this problem lifted off their shoulders.

On Nov. 14, the Supreme Court, in legal jargon, granted a writ of certiorari in response to a petition to review a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit that had struck down a mandate in the Affordable Care Act. That mandate requires that every person have at least a minimally adequate health insurance policy, with the aid of federal subsidies where needed. 
Naturally, the justices will be making major health policy.
Over the last half-century, Congress has repeatedly tried to fix the problem described in the opening paragraph. The Affordable Care Act passed by Congress in March of 2010 is by no means the only attempt to fix this problem.
One earlier attempt, for example, was President Clinton's ill-fated Clinton Health Security Act of 1993. Another was a Republican counterproposal, introduced in 1993 and also ill-fated. 
More recently, in an interesting counterproposal to the Affordable Care Act, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, offered the Patients' Choice Act of May 2009. It never reached the floor of the Senate. 
Finally, we have the Affordable Care Act of March 2010, which did become law, although the fate of one of its centerpieces - the mandate to have insurance -- now is in the minds and hands of the Supreme Court justices. 
All of these proposals have in common that they sought to solve the problem with two major mandates on private health insurers: "community rated" health-insurance premiums and "guaranteed issue."
Community-rated premiums are divorced from the individual applicant's age, gender and health status and reflect only the average annual per-capita actuarial cost of entire communities. Guaranteed issue is a mandate upon health insurers to offer health insurance to anyone willing to pay the quoted premium.
As I have explained in detail in several earlier posts, forcing upon private insurers a mandate of community rating and guaranteed issue will not work, unless accompanied by a mandate upon all citizens to have at least a minimally adequate health insurance policy with specified benefit coverage. 
To see why it is so, keep in mind what a combination of community rating, guaranteed issue and a mandate to be insured seeks to achieve. The aim is to create a risk pool in which younger and healthier enrollees subsidize through their community-rated premiums the health care of older or sicker individuals. It redistributes income, at any point in time, through the insurance premium. 
Naturally, under a one-sided mandate of community rating and guaranteed issue, without a mandate to be insured, healthier and younger individuals will see advantage in gambling, remaining uninsured until illness strikes, at which time one can them throw oneself on the mercy of community rating and guaranteed issue.
Remarkably, younger and healthier individuals in other industrialized countries have long accepted the mandate to be insured in return for community-rated premiums and guaranteed issue. Perhaps they think of the arrangement as a distant cousin of a call option on a common stock. 
In this case, the premium that younger and healthier individuals pay for the call option is the difference between the community-rated premiums and what a premium based on their health status (an "actuarially fair" premium) would be. The benefit of this call option is that later in life, or when illness strikes, the individual can obtain health insurance coverage at a premium much below the actuarially fair premium. 
To my knowledge, President Obama has never explained the mandate in the Affordable Care Act to young people in this way. Perhaps he should.
New York and New Jersey have sought to override basic actuarial principles by mandating community rating and guaranteed issue on insurers without a mandate on individuals to be insured. It is about as sensible as the idea of manufacturing two-legged stools.
Alan Monheit and his colleagues have described with great clarity how that infelicitous legislation in New Jersey has resulted in shrunken risk pools of mainly sicker individuals and how as a result community-rated premiums for individual coverage has increased. 
To get a feel for the impact of the one-sided mandate in New York, readers might look at the staggeringly high premiums quoted by United Healthcare Oxford for its "NY Personal Point of Service Liberty Network" insurance policy. For individual policies, the quoted premium is $1,855.97 a month; for families, $5,707.11. Premiums for the carrier's "NY Personal HMO Plan-Liberty Network" are lower, but still high at $1,259.77 for the individual and $4,749.46 for families.
One must wonder whether the Supreme Court justices' legal fortitude is such as to abstract from these facts the real world.

HIGHLIGHT: Deficit and inflation hawks are killing the world economy. 

 BODY:
What the world needed in this global deleveraging crisis was deficit spending and higher inflation targets. What it got was fiscal austerity and obsessive concern with inflation risks that weren't real. Hence the catastrophe now unfolding.
Judging from recent comments, many readers missed my earlier analyses on these issues -- I'm still getting the "You idiot, debt got us into this mess, how can debt get us out?" type of comment. So let me re-repost my discussion of this whole issue in full, followed by a couple of brief notes on the European situation.
:
Sam, Janet, and Fiscal Policy
One of the common arguments against fiscal policy in the current situation - one that sounds sensible - is that debt is the problem, so how can debt be the solution? Households borrowed too much; now you want the government to borrow even more?
What's wrong with that argument? It assumes, implicitly, that debt is debt - that it doesn't matter who owes the money. Yet that can't be right; if it were, we wouldn't have a problem in the first place. After all, to a first approximation debt is money we owe to ourselves - yes, the US has debt to China etc., but that's not at the heart of the problem. Ignoring the foreign component, or looking at the world as a whole, the overall level of debt makes no difference to aggregate net worth - one person's liability is another person's asset.
It follows that the level of debt matters only if the distribution of net worth matters, if highly indebted players face different constraints from players with low debt. And this means that all debt isn't created equal - which is why borrowing by some actors now can help cure problems created by excess borrowing by other actors in the past.
To see my point, imagine first a world in which there are only two kinds of people: Spendthrift Sams and Judicious Janets. (Sam and Janet who? If you'd grown up in my place and time, you'd know the answer: Sam and Janet evening / You will see a stranger But actually, I'm thinking of the two kinds of agent in the Kiyotaki-Moore model.)
In this world, we'll assume that no real investment is possible, so that loans are made only to finance consumption in excess of income. Specifically, in the past the Sams have borrowed from the Janets to pay for consumption. But now something has happened - say, the collapse of a land bubble - that has forced the Sams to stop borrowing, and indeed to pay down their debt.
For the Sams to do this, of course, the Janets must be prepared to dissave, to run down their assets. What would give them an incentive to do this? The answer is a fall in interest rates. So the normal way the economy would cope with the balance sheet problems of the Sams is through a period of low rates.
But - you probably guessed where I'm going - what if even a zero rate isn't low enough; that is, low enough to induce enough dissaving on the part of the Janets to match the savings of the Sams? Then we have a problem. I haven't specified the underlying macroeconomic model, but it seems safe to say that we'd be looking at a depressed real economy and deflationary pressures. And this will be destructive; not only will output be below potential, but depressed incomes and deflation will make it harder for the Sams to pay down their debt.
What can be done? One answer is inflation, if you can get it, which will do two things: it will make it possible to have a negative real interest rate, and it will in itself erode the debt of the Sams. Yes, that will in a way be rewarding their past excesses - but economics is not a morality play.
Oh, and just to go back for a moment to my point about debt not being all the same: yes, inflation erodes the assets of the Janets at the same time, and by the same amount, as it erodes the debt of the Sams. But the Sams are balance-sheet constrained, while the Janets aren't, so this is a net positive for aggregate demand.
But what if inflation can't or won't be delivered?
Well, suppose a third character can come in: Government Gus. Suppose that he can borrow for a while, using the borrowed money to buy useful things like rail tunnels under the Hudson. The true social cost of these things will be very low, because he'll be putting resources that would otherwise be unemployed to work. And he'll also make it easier for the Sams to pay down their debt; if he keeps it up long enough, he can bring them to the point where they're no longer so severely balance-sheet constrained, and further deficit spending is no longer required to achieve full employment.
Yes, private debt will in part have been replaced by public debt - but the point is that debt will have been shifted away from severely balance-sheet-constrained players, so that the economy's problems will have been reduced even if the overall level of debt hasn't fallen.
The bottom line, then, is that the plausible-sounding argument that debt can't cure debt is just wrong. On the contrary, it can - and the alternative is a prolonged period of economic weakness that actually makes the debt problem harder to resolve.
The European mess is pretty well described by the story above, with the Sams mainly in the periphery and the Janets in the core; what we're getting is forced austerity in the periphery with no offsetting expansion in the core, and now everyone is shocked, shocked that the whole continent seems headed for recession.
In Europe's case, however, higher inflation is even more crucial than for the United States -- because Europe also needs a large adjustment of relative prices that will be very hard if not impossible to achieve with low overall inflation. 
So as of this morning, the 5-year German breakeven -- an implicit forecast of inflation -- is only 0.9%.
This is not going to work.

HEADLINE: The Ad Man Behind Occupy Wall Street, and 'Buy Nothing Day'

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The man behind Occupy Wall Street, and Buy Nothing Day. 

 BODY:
There's a fascinating article in the New Yorker by Mattathias Schwartz that is largely about Kalle Lasn, a rogue retired marketing consultant I interviewed just before Thanksgiving, 2007 -- the first year of this blog -- about his "Buy Nothing Day" campaign.
Schwartz's article charts how Lasn and a colleague at his Adbusters magazine, devoted to ending the consumer culture that Lasn once helped fuel, created the phrase "Occupy Wall Street" and set the date. Social networks, linking people energized by a variegated array of frustrations, did the rest.
As readers here already know, I have nothing against protest, although I'm less a fan of sit-ins than do-ins. While I wrote about Buy Nothing Day in 2007, I followed up by proposing Make Something Day. (Personally, I'd rather see young people occupy Wall Street and related institutions from .)
Below you can read a full repost of the 2007 piece exploring Lasn's less famous campaign.
[1:03 p.m. | Update | A surreal kind of linkage developed between Occupy Wall Street and Black Friday overnight, with news that pepper spray -- deployed controversially by police at various Occupy rallies -- was used by an irate shopper vying for Xbox and Wii products at a California Wal-Mart Black Friday sale.]

Here's the 2007 post: 
As millions of Americans brace for the jammed parking lots and mobbed closeout racks that come with the holiday shopping season, a small but determined network of antishopping activists is girded for action as well.
Their goal is to get as many people as possible to buy nothing at all over a 24-hour span on Friday in the United States (and Saturday elsewhere around the world), as a small blow against what they say are the destructive efforts of advertisers and corporations to fuel the deep-rooted human tendency to want the next new thing.
One of those spearheading the "Buy Nothing Day" campaign is a repentant 65-year-old former ad man, Kalle Lasn. He is the editor of Adbusters, a magazine that says it is "about the erosion of our physical and cultural environments by commercial forces."
Mr. Lasn, from Vancouver, says the targets of the movement are the wealthiest one billion people on the planet, "the 20 percent who consume 80 percent of the goodies in the global marketplace." The goal, he told me, "is to create an economy and a culture in which it eventually becomes cool to consume less." (The magazine, with about 120,000 readers, two-thirds of them in the United States, is not for profit, but it does sell advertising... as does this newspaper of course.)
On the Adbusters Web site, Mr. Lasn has criticized MTV, which he said has refused to sell air time for an antishopping ad depicting North America as a pig.
"Gangsta rap and sexualized, seminaked school girls are OK, but apparently not a burping pig talking about consumption," says the Adbusters site. (I've asked MTV's press office for a comment; nothing yet.)
On Buy Nothing Day, the organizers encourage people to do everything from simple family outings to creative public protests (some groups form snaking lines of nonshoppers pushing empty carts around the aisles at Wal-Mart stores).
The environmental movement holds a range of views on consumption, from those seeking to shut it down to those hoping to redirect it.
Treehugger.com had a useful post this week trying to split the difference between buying nothing and buying smarter. Lloyd Alter, a blogger from Toronto who wrote about the buy nothing effort, put it this way: "My first reaction was, 'Nice idea, if you don't work in a shop.' "
The Treehuggers site, he said, sees many examples of legitimate "eco-retailers who need customers, not boycotts." He alluded to a list of examples of earth-friendly products from an earlier post, including a share in the produce from a local farm cooperative, a bicycle, solar panels, something "preloved" from a thrift shop, a composting toilet.
Still, the more hard-core anticonsumerism movement has gotten a boost in the last few days with its own documentary, "What Would Jesus Buy?" opening in New York City and Los Angeles over the past week. The film, reviewed favorably in The Times, chronicles a cross-country crusade by Reverend Billy of the Church of Stop Shopping, actually a performance artist, Bill Talen.
Here's a trailer for the film.
I asked Mr. Lasn of Adbusters if he thinks humans are hard-wired to grab whatever they can get. He said we face a mix of deep-rooted instinct and an environment overloaded with efforts to exploit that instinct.
"We are hunter-gatherers, sure," he said. "I still enjoy getting something, bringing it home and showing it to my wife. When her face lights up that satisfies me. So our genes are hard-wired. But there is also the environment. Since the second world war we have created a consumer culture pumping something like 3,000 to 5,000 messages into our brains every day from the time you are a baby, when you count logos on products."
The real challenge, he said, is how to change habits in the face of climate change and other looming threats that don't seem to capture our attention.
"I don't think we're wired to deal with this curveball that is coming," he said. "This whole human experiment of ours on planet Earth is now in big trouble, and here we are sipping our lattes and listening to good music in our S.U.V.s."

HEADLINE: Where The Money Is

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The super-elite: richer than you think. 

 BODY:
I've been getting the predictable hysterical reactions to today's column. And it's true -- I'm a Sharia Jewish atheist Marxist who hates America! Bwahahaha!
But one thing actually worth reacting to is the assertion I keep getting that this is all a distraction, that even if we seized all the money of the top 0.1% it would make no difference to the fiscal outlook. Here's a piece of advice nobody will take: before you make assertions about numbers, .
So, what we learn from IRS data is that in 2007, before the Great Recession depressed everyone's income, the top 0.1% had around $1 trillion in taxable income. Now, even confiscating that whole sum wouldn't eliminate our current deficit, especially since the top 0.1% already paid something like a third of that total in taxes. But then, no single action would close our current budget gap -- not even the complete elimination of Social Security or Medicare.
What you want to ask is how much higher taxes on the super-elite might to deficit reduction, as compared with the kinds of things politicians are actually proposing.
So let's suppose that it was possible to collect an additional 10 percent of that super-elite's income in taxes, to the tune of $100 billion a year. How would this stack up against the kinds of things on the table right now?
Well, consider the idea of raising the Medicare eligibility age -- a move that would create vast hardship. According to the Congressional Budget Office (big pdf), when fully phased in this would save ... $42 billion a year.
I could multiply comparisons, but the point is that higher taxes on the very rich could make a significant contribution to deficit reduction. They couldn't eliminate the deficit on their own, but what could? There's real money up there, and those making it should be bearing a share of the burden.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Jeweler Plans $3 Billion I.P.O.

BYLINE: BETTINA WASSENER


HIGHLIGHT: Amid market turmoil, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, based in Hong Kong, is set to stage one of the largest initial public offerings in the world this year, with a listing that could raise more than $3 billion next month. 

 BODY:
4:19 p.m. | Updated 
HONG KONG - Despite the growing nervousness in the global financial markets, a large jewelry company based in Hong Kong is set to stage one of the largest initial public offerings this year, with a listing that could raise as much as $3 billion or more next month.
Chow Tai Fook Jewellery is offering 1.05 billion shares at 15 Hong Kong dollars to 21 Hong Kong dollars each, a person with direct knowledge of the transaction said on Friday.
At the upper end of that range, the proceeds would total 21.05 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $2.7 billion - an amount that could still rise by as much as 15 percent, to about $3.25 billion, if solid demand allows the company to sell more shares, according to this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details were not yet public.
This would make the listing the biggest so far in Hong Kong this year, and one of the largest in the world so far this year. Nervousness over the escalating debt crisis in Europe and feeble growth in the United States has undermined investor sentiment this year and caused new-issue volumes to slump.
Although little known in the West, the family-owned Chow Tai Fook is a giant in the jewelry business.
It has more than 1,500 outlets, nearly all in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan and the former Portuguese colony of Macao, and far outstrips rivals like Cartier and Tiffany's, which, like many other Western luxury companies, have been racing to step up their presence in the rapidly growing Chinese market in recent years.
Asia's rising share in consumer and luxury spending is also prompting Western companies to seek stock market listings in the region.
The Italian luxury retailer Prada listed in Hong Kong earlier this year, and Graff Diamonds, a jeweler based in London, is considering listing in Hong Kong next year, top executives from the company said last week.
The road show for Chow Tai Fook's listing is set to start on Monday, with a trading start in December. Chow Tai Fook declined to comment on Friday.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Derivative Trading, Unemployment and the American Gun Business

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
The Dodd-Frank law aimed to tighten financial regulations in hopes of preventing another meltdown. Among other things, it called for greater transparency in the trading of derivatives.
But in the new Weekend Business podcast, Gretchen Morgenson says an effort is under way in Congress to roll back new rules that would require that certain derivatives - those in the $50 billion swaps market - trade openly on exchanges like stocks or bonds. At the moment, she says in her column in Sunday Business, they trade in one-on-one conversations on the telephone, which, in general, probably results in higher prices and fees.
In another conversation on the podcast, Robert Shiller, the Yale economics professor, says the failure of the Congressional supercommittee to reach a compromise on trimming the United States budget deficit sends the wrong signals about unemployment. Will Congress transcend partisanship and agree on programs that will create jobs, putting the long-term unemployed back to work? In the Economic View column in Sunday Business, he says that this is a truly critical problem, but that it isn't being treated as such by political leaders. And the inability of the economics profession to reach a consensus on the effects of fiscal stimulus hasn't helped matters, he says.
In a separate discussion, Natasha Singer tells David Gillen about the Freedom Group, a little-known power in the American gun business which is the focus of her cover article in Sunday Business. Backed by Cerberus Capital Management, a giant private equity firm, Freedom Group now controls the 195-year-old Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS Firearms, leading makers of military-style semiautomatics. 
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Gretchen Morgenson on derivative trading (30:41); news headlines (22:38); the American gun business (19:00); Robert Shiller (9:35); the week ahead (1:33).
As articles discussed in the podcast are published during the weekend, links will be added to this post.

HEADLINE: Latest Updates on Black Friday Sales

BYLINE: CHRISTINE HAUSER


HIGHLIGHT: The Lede blog is following the Black Friday action through the day. 

 BODY:
4:33 P.M. | Shopping Differently at Apple
Unlike the usual brouhaha associated with Black Friday retail shopping, the Apple store in Palo Alto was line-free on Friday morning, and some customers reported being in and out of the store with new iPads, Macs or iPods in less than 20 minutes.
Apple on Friday cut prices for its iPad by up to $60 (regular price $499 and up), and Macs by $100 (regularly $999 and up), among other small discounts. Upon entering, customers were greeted with a "Gift Guide" brochure explaining the sales.
"It's not like Target, which is a very different kind of store," said Bo Nierhaus, a San Jose resident who said she was able to buy an iPad 2 from the Apple store after just 10 minutes. "You know the products, so it's straightforward. You go in and you get it."
As of 11 a.m. Friday, Macs and iPads were still in stock at the Palo Alto retail branch. The vast majority of customers were buying iPads, according to Diego Aguirre, a sales specialist at the store.
"We're seeing a big influx in iPad sales," Mr. Aguirre said. "I think it's because of the lower price point." He said that for his sales that day, customers were purchasing the iPad model with Wi-Fi only, not with the additional 3G option, which costs an extra $130.
In addition to a horde of shoppers, the Palo Alto store was crowded with Apple customer-service employees wearing red polo shirts. The store was fully staffed with 150 employees working Black Friday, according to Mr. Aguirre.
Mr. Aguirre claimed that Apple's "Express Shopping" zone - where customers can walk in and directly ask for what they want - was streamlining sales. He added that the Apple Store app allowed customers to purchase a product before entering the store, and to immediately pick it up upon entering.
3:01 P.M. | Occupying Consumerism
The Occupy movement had protesters in a number of American cities on Black Friday, but there were no reports of any large-scale disruptions. The movement had planned to fan out to stores across the country, sending out a message to shoppers about curbing unnecessary spending, for example, and urging people to buy local.
In Chicago, our colleague Steven Yaccino reported that a small group of Occupy Chicago protesters heckled customers who were waiting outside of a Best Buy store. But for at least one shopper, Ellie Fox, 72, the only thing that deterred her from buying the Samsung 15.6-inch laptop for $299.99 that she had hankered for was that it had sold out by the time she fought her way through the jam-packed aisles.
"It was on my bucket list," said Ms. Fox. "I'm just a old woman looking for a good deal."
Elsewhere, Occupy Seattle said it would hold a rally from noon to 5 p.m. at Westlake Park in Seattle's downtown retail core and a demonstration at 2 p.m. at the Wal-Mart in Renton. Occupy Seattle said it was promoting homemade gifts and local businesses as an alternative to what it calls "rampant consumerism that plagues society, destroys the environment and supports the 1 percent," The Associated Press reported.
Occupy Wall Street protesters turned up for the Macy's midnight opening in New York, and flash mobs and other events in Washington and Boise, Idaho, were on the agenda. 
2:11 p.m. | Electronics in Demand
So what exactly were people standing on line for hours for?
PriceGrabber said in a report today that the products of highest interest included LED televisions, PlayStation consoles, and iPods and iPads. The Xbox console was up there too. Digital cameras, computers and toys were also in demand, with clothing, mostly jackets and boots, also popular.
 EBay said in a report earlier this week that products that have captured shoppers' interest (as measured by scans with its barcode app, RedLaser) included the iPad, the Samsung i9100 Galaxy S II smartphone, the iPhone, and the PlayStation.
New York Times reporter Julie Creswell reports from New Jersey that hot products ranged from consumer electronics to hardware:
At the Wal-Mart in Cedar Knolls, N.J., Savan Patel wheeled out a 42-inch Vizio HDTV for $600. Mr. Patel, a college student, was on his way with friends to Lowe's and Home Depot next for a deal on a miter saw.
"I'd come out here even if there weren't sales," said Mr. Patel, who estimated he had spent $1,500 so far, much more than he had last year, when he bought only a printer.
When a member of his group asked if he needed the miter saw, Mr. Patel laughed, "Need? No. But I've wanted one for a while."
But demand varied from place to place. Take one example, the Xbox and video games, as seen on both coasts.
 At a Wal-Mart in Porter Ranch, Calif., shoppers described a chaotic scene erupting over video games. The Los Angeles Times quoted one customer saying that screams erupted after about 100 people waiting in line to snag Xbox gaming consoles and Wii video games got into a shoving match.
But at a Target store in East Hanover N.J., as Julie Creswell reports, two first-time Black Friday shoppers said they were surprised by how thin the crowds were by 8:30 a.m. Lisa Berk, a consultant from Livingston, N.J., headed for the checkout counter with considerably less drama, having secured an Xbox 360 console for $139.
"There were quite a few Xbox's still on the shelves," Ms. Berk said. "You didn't have to wake up early to get all of the deals."
12:31 p.m. | The Stay-at-Home Crowd
Our friends at the Bits blog report that more shoppers will be choosing presents in their pajamas this year, with online sales expected to grow 15 percent. Convenience, competitive pricing and, for many, free shipping are the reasons.
12:04 p.m. | The Macro View of Shoppers
In the months leading up to Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping events of the year, we have been reporting on how the nation's economy has been plodding along with slow growth and a struggling job market. So how does that picture fit in with the images of the hundreds of thousands of people flooding stores and shopping malls today? Some of the answers can be found in the article from our colleague, Stephanie Clifford, which has extensive quotes from around the country from the shoppers themselves: Prices are cheap, deals just cannot be passed up.
But there are analysts who are paid to go beyond the anecdotes and dive into the numbers to find a pattern for consumer behavior. Recent government statistics showed, for example, that in October personal income rose, albeit marginally, because of stronger wages and salaries. Disposable income, after inflation is taken into account, was up slightly as well, and that was after being in negative territory for three months in a row. At the same time, prices are easing: gasoline and food prices fell in September. Word of caution: No one is saying consumers are in great shape, especially with millions out of work, but the statistics are worth mentioning.
One economist who drilled in to the latest figures reflected on the pros and cons of the state of American consumers is Chris Christopher, who works for IHS Global Insight.
"Looking ahead," he said, "spending should pick up in the holiday shopping season, as consumers find good deals, and some people have a little extra disposable income in their pockets."
The data, he said, "is saying from what we know, people are still struggling but they are still looking for a good deal." And in doing so, consumers might employ a bit of horse-trading, so to speak: buying a big consumer electronics product now, but holding back on other purchases in the months ahead.
"It is very hard to judge this on macro-economic data, but if we observe individuals it may show the following process: cutting down on other spending where they can," he said.
10:58 a.m. | The Biggest Mall Weighs In
At the Mall of America, the largest retail and entertainment complex in the United States, where shoppers started massing as early as Thursday morning, there were an estimated 15,000 people in lines or milling about the complex by midnight. Based on expanded hours this year, a spokeswoman for the mall said it expected to exceed the 200,000 Black Friday shoppers it had in 2010.
By midmorning on Friday, the lines were gone, yet like the tide they could come back to take advantage of last-minute deals that are expected to expire at midday.
Bridget Jewell, the spokeswoman, said 120 of the 520 stores were open at midnight and the rest by 6 a.m., absorbing the approximately 600 people outside of Best Buy; 200 or more outside of H&M; and 200 waiting for Old Navy.
"I have been walking around and there aren't any long lines," she said. "People have filtered through and it is a steady period. We think that will pick up because a lot of the deals are ending at noon, so we think that we will see a little bit of an influx."

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $15.5 Million

HIGHLIGHT: The sale of an apartment at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, that cynosure of all things civilized and repository of secrets for presidents and starlets alike, was the most expensive of the week. 

 BODY:
The $15.5 million sale of an apartment at the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side, that cynosure of all things civilized and repository of secrets for presidents and starlets alike, was the most expensive of the week.
Like the rest of the 68 private residences at the Carlyle, the four-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath apartment is a co-op. The asking price was $17.5 million, according to Streeteasy. The sale price was confirmed by the listing agency, Brown Harris Stevens. Kathy Sloane, who brokered the sale for Brown Harris, declined to comment.
The Carlyle, which opened in 1930, is one of a handful of Old World-style hotels in New York that offer residential apartments in addition to hotel rooms. It also has earned a reputation for discretion.
Nearly every American president since Harry S. Truman has stayed in the hotel, with John F. Kennedy keeping an apartment there for a decade. It has long been rumored that Marilyn Monroe would sneak up to Kennedy's Carlyle apartment via tunnels beneath the hotel and then the service elevator.
In keeping with the hush-hush tradition, both the seller and the buyer of the latest apartment to trade hands made all parties involved pledge their confidentiality.
Beyond a location at 76th Street and Madison Avenue and sweeping western views that include Central Park, the apartment comes with all the conveniences of luxury hotel living.
"Anything from theater tickets to flowers, to chartering airplanes, can be accomplished by the Carlyle concierge," the listing read.
And whatever happens at the Carlyle, residents are assured, will stay at the Carlyle.
Big Ticket covers closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Their Own Facts

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Frum gets it. 

 BODY:
David Frum of "Axis of Evil" fame -- who is some kind of distant cousin of mine -- has an excellent piece in explaining his apostasy from the modern GOP. Best line:
Backed by their own wing of the book-publishing industry and supported by think tanks that increasingly function as public-relations agencies, conservatives have built a whole alternative knowledge system, with its own facts, its own history, its own laws of economics. Outside this alternative reality, the United States is a country dominated by a strong Christian religiosity. Within it, Christians are a persecuted minority. Outside the system, President Obama-whatever his policy errors-is a figure of imposing intellect and dignity. Within the system, he's a pitiful nothing, unable to speak without a teleprompter, an affirmative-action phony doomed to inevitable defeat. Outside the system, social scientists worry that the U.S. is hardening into one of the most rigid class societies in the Western world, in which the children of the poor have less chance of escape than in France, Germany, or even England. Inside the system, the U.S. remains (to borrow the words of Senator Marco Rubio) "the only place in the world where it doesn't matter who your parents were or where you came from." 
Frum himself isn't completely free of this alternative reality. He still insists that Obama is building a much bigger government, which just isn't true; there's health reform, which will require subsidies in the vicinity of 1 percent of GDP to operate, but there are no other major expansions of government on the table.
Still, it's a good piece; would that more old-style Republicans were willing to open their eyes and see that the party they once supported has been transformed into a madhouse.

HEADLINE: After Taking In Refugees for Years, a New Hampshire City Asks for a Pause

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- This city has long been a resettlement site for refugees, sent here by the State Department for a chance at a better life. More than 60 languages are spoken in the school system, with Somalis, Sudanese, Iraqis and other recent arrivals mixing with children whose ancestors came from Quebec to work in the mighty textile mills along the Merrimack River.
But this year, after decades of taking in refugees, Manchester said, ''Enough.''
In a highly unusual move, Mayor Ted Gatsas and the city's Board of Aldermen asked the State Department in July to halt resettlements here for now. A tide of more than 2,100 refugees over the last decade -- most recently, Bhutanese families coming from camps in Nepal -- has been more than the city of 109,500 can assure jobs and decent housing for, Mr. Gatsas said. 
''We're just saying, 'Let us catch our breath,' '' he said last week in an interview at City Hall. ''This is about giving people the opportunity for a better life, and until I can get that person working and gainfully employed and getting to learn the language, I can't do that.''
The mayor, a Republican who just won a second term, says he has nothing against refugees. His problem is with the International Institute of New England, a nonprofit agency based in Boston that brings them to Manchester and helps them adjust for several months, providing cash and other assistance.
Mr. Gatsas, a former businessman whose grandfather immigrated here from Greece a century ago, said the institute had consistently refused to seek the city's advice, most recently on its plan to bring 300 more refugees to Manchester in the current fiscal year.
His effort to stanch the flow of newcomers from other countries is different, of course, from the battles raging against illegal immigration in other corners of the nation. Refugees come here legally, through a carefully planned process that brings them from hard-luck camps in some of the world's most troubled regions to some 200 cities and towns where local nonprofit groups help them settle in.
Two other cities have restrictions in place, according to the State Department: Detroit, where refugees can be resettled only if they have friends or family there already, and Fort Wayne, Ind., where only refugees with close relatives there can go. But while others have raised concerns about resettlement during the economic downturn, none have asked to stop it altogether, said Larry Bartlett, director of the State Department's Office of Refugee Admissions.
''It's very rare,'' Mr. Bartlett said of Manchester's request. ''Despite the challenges that accompany refugee resettlement and helping people remake their lives, I think it's such a core national value that communities find a way to continue even despite the poor economic times or other problems they may be experiencing.''
For the International Institute, which has been resettling refugees in New Hampshire for decades, the moratorium request came as a shock, said William J. Gillett, chairman of the agency's board. Although the agency has resettled 844 refugees in Manchester over the last three years -- almost as many as the 984 it has resettled in Boston, a city with almost six times as many residents -- there has been no indication of trouble, he said.
''We did not believe the numbers we were suggesting were in any way inappropriate,'' Mr. Gillett said. ''We didn't see any evidence of undue strain on city resources.''
Although refugees are also resettled in other New Hampshire cities, including Concord and Nashua, far more come to Manchester, the largest city in northern New England, because it has more jobs, affordable housing and public transportation.
''It's one of the most fabulous places in the world to resettle,'' said Carolyn Benedict-Drew, the institute's president and chief executive.
But the institute admits that affordable apartments have sometimes proved unacceptable. In 2009, a bedbug infestation at a former mill building that houses refugees grabbed headlines and raised awareness of the squalid conditions some were living in. Patrick Long, a Democratic alderman who voted for the moratorium, said the institute ''just wasn't there to help'' with the bedbug problem, which led to a city task force that came up with recommendations for improving refugee housing, education and other needs.
''The apartments they were putting them in were shabby,'' he said, ''and their employment numbers were misleading.''
On housing, Mr. Gillett said, ''We do the best we can within the price constraints we have.''
The institute says most refugees who are capable of working land jobs relatively quickly. But that number is misleading, Mr. Gatsas said, because it includes seasonal jobs that might last only a few weeks or months. And while Manchester used to have plenty of work for people who did not speak English, he said, those jobs are harder to find as the economic base shifts from manufacturing to high tech. A meatpacking plant that used to employ refugees closed in 2004, and a manufacturing company that employed others in nearby Merrimack closed soon after.
And with state and federal budgets being cut ever more sharply in the downturn, Mr. Long said, there is less aid to refugees than ever.
''We're just starting to see more needs with the new arrivals,'' he said. ''As the years go by we're going to be seeing a lot less federal money, a lot less state money, so what do we do? We take a proactive step now, so three, four, five years from now we're not saying, 'We've got 1,200 people who are out on the street.' ''
Mr. Long and Mr. Gatsas said a number of refugees had expressed support for a moratorium. But in interviews last week, while several did express concerns about the job market and housing conditions, most said the proposal was upsetting. Some, like Hari Niroula, 25, who arrived here last month, said they had relatives still languishing in refugee camps and feared they would be blocked from coming to Manchester.
Suraj Budathoki, a Bhutanese refugee who came here in 2008 after 18 years in a refugee camp, said that while refugees might struggle in Manchester, life here was preferable to the conditions they put up with in camps.
''I stayed in a camp and I know every single minute there is terrible,'' he said. ''The life here in Manchester is far better, 110 percent better, than the life in a refugee camp.''
Mr. Bartlett said that after hearing the city's concerns, his office had decided to send some 200 refugees to Manchester this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, instead of the 300 proposed by the International Institute. While the State Department often tinkers with the numbers proposed by resettlement agencies, he said, ''this was probably a more significant reduction than we would normally make.''
A moratorium would make no sense, he said, partly because virtually all refugees scheduled to arrive in Manchester this year have family here and would likely end up in the city even if they were initially sent somewhere else.
Meanwhile, leaders of the International Institute said they would try harder to work with the city. Michael McGandy, who started in March as the institute's site manager in Manchester, said high staff turnover and the intense demands of helping refugees over their first three months had perhaps kept the agency from communicating with the city as much as it should.
''We could do a better job with outreach to the community and dispelling myths and making sure people know the facts,'' he said.
But Mr. Gatsas said that he was not pleased with the compromise and that he would persist with another tactic: lobbying the state's Executive Council, which disburses federal money, to table grants for some of the institute's programs. Should that fail, he said, Mr. Gatsas might try to rally mayors in other resettlement cities to his cause. He has made a point of describing the situation to the Republican presidential candidates who have filed through his office in recent months in hopes of drawing more attention to it.
''If we don't get the outcome we're looking for, trust me, I might have a few hundred of them up here to have that discussion,'' he said. ''I think people will tell you I'm pretty tenacious on an issue. I'm not going to stop.''

HEADLINE: To Rethink Sprawl, Start With Offices

BYLINE: By LOUISE A. MOZINGO. 
Louise A. Mozingo, a professor of landscape architecture and environmental planning at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author of ''Pastoral Capitalism: A History of Suburban Corporate Landscapes.''

 BODY:
San Francisco
IN an era of concern about climate change, residential suburbs are the focus of a new round of critiques, as low-density developments use more energy, water and other resources. But so far there's been little discussion of that other archetype of sprawl, the suburban office.
Rethinking sprawl might begin much more effectively with these business enclaves. They cover vast areas and are occupied by a few powerful entities, corporations, which at some point will begin spending their ample reserves to upgrade, expand or replace their facilities. 
The bucolic business office is not a state-of-the-art workplace but rather a decades-old model of corporate retreat. In 1942 the AT&T Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.
The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.
Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.
In metropolitan areas across America, corporate campuses for research and development units proliferated and top executives ensconced themselves in palatial estates like the Deere & Co. Administrative Center outside Moline, Ill. Meanwhile, branch offices, small corporations and start-ups found footing in the office parks that lined suburban highways and arterial roads, like those of Silicon Valley in California and the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina.
Born in an era of seemingly limitless resources, this pastoral capitalism restructured the landscape of metropolitan regions; today it accounts for well over half the office space in the United States.
Yet suburban offices are even more unsustainably designed than residential suburbs. Sidewalks extend only between office buildings and parking lots, expanses of open space remain private and the spreading of offices over large zones precludes effective mass transit.
These workplaces embody a new form of segregation, where civic space connecting work to the shops, housing, recreation and transportation that cities used to provide is entirely absent. Corporations have cut themselves off from participation in a larger public realm.
Rethinking pastoral capitalism is integral to creating a connected, compact metropolitan landscape that tackles rather than sidesteps a post-peak-oil future. This requires three interrelated strategies. State and federal governments should stop paying for new highway extensions that essentially subsidize the conversion of agricultural land for development, including corporate offices. Existing infrastructure needs maintenance and renewal, not expansion.
Suburban jurisdictions that now require little of the next corporate campus other than plentiful parking can demand more. For instance, they can use zoning codes to require pedestrian, bicycle and mass-transit links to adjacent residential developments. Add to the mix new public spaces, a greater diversity of uses, and transit between multiple employment centers and residential districts -- not only to and from the downtown -- and suburban corporate offices could initiate a wave of reform.
While suburban offices will continue to exist, some corporations can re-occupy city centers that they abandoned two generations ago. Development parcels, vacant offices and economic subsidies lie waiting in cities like Cleveland, Hartford, Raleigh, N.C., and Birmingham, Ala. These downtowns are well served by transit and pedestrian connections, a mix of retail and service uses, and a surprising amount of newly built and renovated housing where workers can live.
All three steps -- a halt to agricultural land conversion, connecting dispersed employment centers with alternative transit, and encouraging downtown development -- are needed to create renewed, civic-minded corporate workplaces and, in the process, move toward sustainable cities. Even leaving aside climate change, very soon the price of energy will make the dispersed, unconnected, low-density city-building pattern impossibly costly. Those jurisdictions and businesses that first create livable, workable, post-peak-oil metropolitan regions are the ones that will win the future.

HEADLINE: Dismal Week Ends With More of Same

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The worst week for the stock market in two months ended with a whimper in thin trading Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 4.8 percent this week, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.7 percent. It was the worst week for both since Sept. 23. 
Major indexes wavered throughout Friday's session, which was shortened because it was the day after Thanksgiving. Worries about Europe's debt crisis flared up again after Italy had to pay 7.8 percent to borrow for two years at a debt auction. It was another sign that investors were increasingly hesitant to lend to European countries.
The euro slipped to $1.3232, losing 2 percent this week against the dollar. The drop puts the euro at its lowest level since Oct. 4.
Higher interest rates on government debt of Italy, Spain and other European countries have rattled stock markets in recent weeks. When borrowing costs climb above the 7 percent threshold, it deepens investor fears about a government's ability to manage its debts. Greece, Ireland and Portugal had to seek financial lifelines when their interest rates crossed the same mark.
The Dow fell 25.77 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 11,231.78. Of the Dow's 30 stocks, Chevron lost 1.6 percent, or $1.46, to $92.29 Friday, the biggest drop. Travelers added 1.2 percent, or 65 cents, to $53.41, the largest gain.
The S.& P. 500 lost 3.12 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,158.67. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 18.57 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 2,441.51.
Trading volume was 1.6 billion, less than half the daily average.
Markets were battered this week as governments in Europe and the United States struggled to tackle their debts. The Dow lost 248 points on Monday when a Congressional committee failed to reach a deal to cut federal budget deficits. It plunged 236 points Wednesday after investors balked at buying German government debt.
Retailers traded mixed on the Friday after Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season.
Amazon.com dropped 3.5 percent, or $6.59, to $182.40. Wal-Mart Stores inched up 0.4 percent, or 25 cents, to $56.89.
A record number of people were expected to show up at stores this weekend to take advantage of deep discounts. The National Retail Federation estimates that 152 million people will go shopping over the three days starting on Friday. That would be an increase of 10 percent from last year.
Shares of AT&T dipped less than 1 percent. The company said Thursday that it is budgeting to pay $4 billion in break-up fees if its attempted $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom falls apart.

HEADLINE: A Voice Suggests Door-Busters Can Wait

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Anthony Hardwick never thought of himself as an activist or even much of an organizer. He grew up in Kansas City, Mo., graduated from Park University in Missouri in 2009, and looked for a job by scouring the Internet for cities with low unemployment rates. He settled on Omaha, where he found two -- as a shopping cart attendant at Target and a printing supervisor for OfficeMax. There he met his fiancee, Denise Holling.
''Basically, I just wanted to pursue the American Dream,'' Mr. Hardwick told me this week, as the bearded, burly 29-year-old emerged as the unlikely hero of a nationwide movement to roll back the start of the holiday shopping season to the day after Thanksgiving.
Late last month, Mr. Hardwick's supervisor at Target told him he would be needed at 11 p.m. Thanksgiving night in order for Target to open its doors at midnight for Black Friday, which the discount retailer was doing for the first time this year. 
''I'd have to be at Target from 11 p.m. until 4:30 a.m., then I'd have 30 minutes to scurry down to OfficeMax, where I was starting at 5 a.m.,'' he said. Mr. Hardwick makes $8.50 an hour at Target, and between his two jobs earns about $25,000 a year. ''I used to be able to pull 24-hour shifts,'' he said. ''I'd drink Red Bull. But now I'm 29, and I'm starting to feel it. I'd have to nap.''
This didn't sit well with Mr. Hardwick, who figured he'd be sleeping while his fiancee and future in-laws gathered for the traditional turkey dinner. Although a Target spokeswoman told me the company did its best to accommodate employees who wanted the day off, this often isn't possible, and Mr. Hardwick said he wasn't given the option. Mr. Hardwick turned to the Internet and discovered the Web site Change.org, best known for a recent online petition to get banks to roll back debit card fees.
''A midnight opening robs the hourly and in-store salary workers of time off with their families on Thanksgiving Day,'' he posted on Nov. 3. ''A full holiday with family is not just for the elite of this nation -- all Americans should be able to break bread with loved ones and get a good night's rest on Thanksgiving!'' He asked the Web site's visitors to join him in calling for Target retail stores to restore the 5 a.m. opening time on Black Friday.
But a ''full holiday with family'' has become increasingly elusive as competition from 24/7, 365-days-a-year Internet shopping has caused retailers to throw open their doors on a day once sacrosanct ''as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens,'' as Abraham Lincoln put it when he established the national holiday in 1863.
Franklin Roosevelt moved the holiday to the fourth Thursday in November (from the last Thursday) in an overt attempt to lengthen the holiday shopping season and bolster retail sales during the Depression. And the holiday's demise as a no-shopping interlude is the culmination of a steady retreat from pervasive blue laws that once banned shopping not only on Thanksgiving and other major holidays but also on Sundays. Today Massachusetts and Rhode Island are the last states to restrict shopping on Thanksgiving, and Paramus, N.J., the site of several major malls, may be unique in banning shopping on Thanksgiving and Sundays.
''The blue laws began in Massachusetts with the Pilgrims, so I guess it's fitting that we still have them,'' Jon B. Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, said. ''Christmas is sacrosanct. But there's been a bill proposed to permit shopping on Thanksgiving. It hasn't moved. We endorse it every year, but do I have members beating down my door to push this? No.''
Among national retailers, Target is hardly the worst offender. Although some Target stores are open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thanksgiving before reopening at midnight, Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, has been open all day on Thanksgiving for years, and this year moved up its Black Friday door-buster specials to 10 p.m. Thursday. K-Mart and many Gap and Old Navy stores are also open all day, and a wave of stores, including Macy's and Best Buy, opened this year at midnight on Friday with special holiday promotions. Some retailers are now talking about ''Black Thanksgiving.''
''For many people Black Friday shopping is now as much a part of the holiday tradition as the turkey,'' the Target spokeswoman said. ''Black Friday has an exciting, euphoric feeling. A lot of our team members get very excited. Months of hard work have gone into preparing for this.'' She said Target moved up its store openings to midnight only after much deliberation, and the move had been ''overwhelmingly popular'' with both customers and employees.
Mr. Hardwick said he was aware of all this, and had modest expectations for his petition. ''I promoted it on Facebook and figured I'd sign up some friends and family,'' he said. ''At first it just sat there.'' But gradually comments piled up on the Change.org Web site.
''I'm sick and tired of these attempts to brainwash us into thinking Christmas is about how much money we spend,'' Deborah Schwartz posted. From Bryce Allison: ''It's a national holiday, not a national shopping day ... maybe try giving thanks for your employees that bring you so much money.'' Scotty Brookie wrote, ''Encouraging people to shop in the middle of the night is bizarre.''
David Breeden, a Unitarian Universalist minister in Minneapolis, saw Mr. Hardwick's petition in the broader context of the holiday. ''Thanksgiving is one of the few civil holidays,'' he said. ''A lot of people don't celebrate Christmas. But Thanksgiving is a national holiday and it's a day for giving thanks for what we have. What's wrong with stores opening at 10 a.m. on Friday? Everything will still be on the shelves when you unlock those doors. How about letting everyone breathe for a day and just relax? That's a spiritual issue, too.''
New York Times reporter Stephanie Clifford mentioned Mr. Hardwick in a recent article in which others expressed their dismay that Thanksgiving was turning into another shopping day. Other media contacted him. ''I've been on TV,'' he said. ''I spoke to NBC; I spoke to MSNBC, CNN, the Christian Broadcasting Network.'' People at Change.org helped him manage the attention, and he finally got to put his college degree in public relations to use. Thousands of online supporters flocked to the petition. ''I was overjoyed and flabbergasted,'' he said.
He also drew his share of critics, most saying he should stop whining and give thanks that he has a job at all. ''That was the same argument that was used when 7-year-olds were working in coal mines,'' he said. He doesn't belong to any unions or expect to join one, but ''It hasn't been that long in our history that workers have had a voice,'' he said. ''To give that up does my forefathers a disservice and I'm not going to do that.''
Target has been handling Mr. Hardwick gingerly. ''We have a great belief and understanding that team members should express their feelings,'' the Target spokeswoman said. As Mr. Hardwick's petition gained momentum, his holiday hours disappeared. He said his supervisor told him there had been a misunderstanding and ''they were able to meet their staffing needs without my services.''
Earlier this week Mr. Breeden, the minister, led a small group to Target headquarters in Minneapolis where he presented officials with Target shopping bags bulging with nearly 200,000 signed copies of Mr. Hardwick's petition. They had called ahead, and security guards in blazers and a Target official met them in the lobby. ''It was all very polite and civil,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''We weren't carrying bullhorns or trying to disrupt anything.''
On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Hardwick joined his fiancee and future in-laws -- and six newborn puppies -- for a dinner of bacon-wrapped turkey, ham and side dishes before heading to bed around 9 p.m.
At OfficeMax, a customer had recognized him. ''You're the Save-Thanksgiving guy!'' He said he hoped that next year, Target would reconsider its early opening, or at least allow employees to opt out of Thanksgiving duty and hire additional workers from the ranks of the unemployed. ''This wasn't really about me,'' he told me on Thanksgiving. ''It's about my co-workers, my team members and anyone else in retail.''
By 10 p.m. Thanksgiving night a line had formed outside Target's Bloomington, Minn., store, a scene that a spokeswoman said was repeated at their stores around the country. As the line grew to about 1,500 people, employees gathered inside, chanted and then counted down the seconds to midnight. They clapped and cheered as shoppers poured in. Supplies of a Westinghouse 48-inch flat-screen HDTV, offered at $298, sold out in six minutes.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. Labor Talks Resume in Hope of a Christmas Tip-Off

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
On a frantic Black Friday in Midtown Manhattan, the most enticing deal in reach was not in an expensive Fifth Avenue department store, but in a cavernous office building next door. There, in a quiet law office, negotiators tried one last time to end the N.B.A.'s labor crisis and to bring back pro basketball in time for the holidays.
Representatives for the owners and players gathered at noon and were still talking as of 12:15 a.m. If they reach an agreement this weekend, the N.B.A. will open on Christmas Day and hold a 66-game season. If talks fail again, there will probably not be a season. 
It was the second meeting of the week, but the first involving all of the key figures since Nov. 10, when negotiations for a new labor deal collapsed. Since then, the players have dissolved their union and sued the league in federal court.
Technically, Friday's meeting was a settlement conference designed to resolve the legal issues. For all practical purposes, this was another bargaining session -- the 25th since the lockout began 148 days earlier.
Commissioner David Stern represented the N.B.A., along with the deputy commissioner Adam Silver, the San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt and the league's top two lawyers. The players were represented by the former leaders of their now-defunct union: Billy Hunter, Derek Fisher, Mo Evans, their lawyer, Ron Klempner, and their outside economist, Kevin Murphy.
The lawyers spearheading the players' antitrust lawsuit, David Boies and Jonathan Schiller, were not present Friday. Nor was Jeffrey Kessler, their chief outside counsel, who until now has been the players' lead negotiator.
Kessler's absence was not immediately explained, but the reasons seemed clear, given recent events. Jim Quinn -- who preceded Kessler as the union's outside counsel -- was recently hired by Hunter to get the talks restarted. Although Kessler remains involved, Quinn effectively supplanted him as the union's leading voice. N.B.A. officials regard Kessler as a divisive force and a contentious negotiator who has been an impediment to making a deal. But Quinn, who served as the union's outside counsel for two decades, engenders respect on both sides and has a strong rapport with league officials, including Stern.
Quinn was at the table when the parties quietly reconvened Tuesday, but he was out of town Friday. One of his associates took his place.
If a deal is reached this weekend, the N.B.A. will need about four weeks to get the season started, putting it on pace for a Dec. 25 opening. The league will compress the schedule and push back the playoffs to squeeze in the 66 games, despite starting eight weeks late.
Any handshake agreement would still have to be ratified by both sides, a process made slightly more cumbersome because the players dissolved their union on Nov. 14. The players will have to drop their lawsuit and reconstitute the union before they can hold a vote.
Ratification requires a simple majority of the owners of the N.B.A.'s 30 teams and a simple majority of the 430-plus players.
The new labor deal is expected to feature a 50-50 split of revenue -- representing a $300 million salary reduction for the players -- along with shorter contracts, smaller raises and harsher penalties on the top-spending teams.
Most of the critical issues were resolved weeks ago. A handful of thorny items were still on the table, including proposed free-agency restrictions on teams that pay the luxury tax. The players are fighting to preserve full midlevel exceptions and sign-and-trade deals for teams that pay the tax. They are also fighting a league proposal that would increase the withholding from player paychecks. The escrow tax, as it is called, is designed to ensure that players do not exceed the agreed-upon 50 percent of revenues.

HEADLINE: How to Make the Case For Higher Pay

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
So you've been keeping your head down, working as hard as you can -- glad, you tell yourself, that you even have a job.
But you've been doing that for several years now. And in that time, the cost of your health insurance has gone up, along with college tuition, gasoline and a host of other things. Your pay, meanwhile, has been stagnant.
Asking for a raise is hard enough in normal economic times. But now, you can't help wondering: does the mere act of asking for more money come with its own risks?
''If you are a good-performing employee who is contributing, I think it poses zero danger,'' said Mike Zwell, a consultant and author of ''Six-Figure Salary Negotiation'' (Adams Media, 2008). ''The worst that will happen is that they will say no, and give you some reason for it.'' 
There have been some encouraging signs on pay lately. Only about 9 percent of companies have put pay freezes in place over the last 18 months, a rate more in line with historical levels. That's down from the nearly two-thirds of companies that had pay freezes in place in January 2010, according to research conducted by Buck Consultants.
''The reality is that most companies have responded very quickly and effectively to the changing economic conditions,'' Mr. Zwell said. ''So the feelings of scarcity are much greater than the actual scarcity for those who are employed.''
Still, compensation budgets remain tight, and the employees who are getting raises tend to be their company's top-performing stars with unique skills -- in other words, the employees who stand the highest risk of being poached by competitors.
But even if you are one of the lucky ones and your request is granted, the rewards aren't likely to be nearly as generous as you may have hoped. Most recently, the typical merit increase has been 1.9 to 2 percent on average, whereas the highest-performing employees are getting closer to 4 percent, according to Stephen Mork, principal of global compensation and benefits at Buck Consultants.
By contrast, in 2007, the average merit increase was about 3.8 percent for a midlevel manager, which was largely in line with raises across all employee levels. ''Four percent was the good old days,'' Mr. Mork said, noting that in 2006 and earlier, raises of 4 to 5 percent were not uncommon.
How can you set yourself apart? Much depends on how you are perceived and your overall approach when you pop the question. So before you walk into your boss's office, several career gurus suggested considering the following:
ARE YOU DESERVING? Well before you ask about a raise, you need to get a sense of how you are perceived. Most workers have said their employers don't provide enough feedback, according to Buck Consultants. And as much as that says about supervisors' lack of communication, it also shows that employees aren't doing enough either. ''If you are not getting those measures, then you are not managing your career properly,'' Mr. Mork said, ''and that ties into your pay and asking for merit increases.''
So if your employer doesn't have formal performance reviews in place, set up a time to ask your supervisor about how you're doing.
THE PREPARATION Once you've decided that you are deserving, take the time to build your case. Ideally, your higher-ups already have an idea of how you're doing, which means you'll need to engage in a modest amount of self-promotion over the course of the year. ''You need to have an internal and external P.R. strategy,'' said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford's business school and author of ''Power: Why Some People Have It -- and Others Don't'' (HarperBusiness, 2010). ''You need to build a reputation. You need to have people know who you are.''
You should also keep a file of the ''attaboy and attagirl'' letters from associates or clients, which will help justify your request. And keep track of any additional responsibilities you've taken on, perhaps because others were laid off or your role has simply evolved or expanded.
Meanwhile, try to frame your contributions in measurable ways, said Marty Martin, an associate professor of human resources at DePaul University and a financial psychologist at Aequus Wealth Management in Chicago. That is easier to do in some positions than others -- like sales, for instance -- so you may need to get creative.
Putting it all down on paper will help you organize your thoughts. On one side, make a column listing all of your responsibilities. In another column (which should be considerably longer), list what you've accomplished in order of importance, said Kate Wendleton, president of the Five O'Clock Club, a career coaching organization.
Going through this exercise will help you develop a strong case for your supervisors, many of whom don't even control the company purse strings. So make their job easy. ''To give you a raise, your boss must ask his or her superior, which is probably just as nerve-racking for your boss as it was for you,'' Ms. Wendleton said.
THE NUMBERS Also try to assess how fairly you're being paid. The most effective way may be through networking or internal sources, whether it's human resources or other employees you can trust, Mr. Zwell said. Does your company have pay grades with minimum and maximum levels? Where do you fall? Is your request realistic? ''You should be finding this out before you ask for a raise,'' he added.
You can also consult the many Web sites that collect salary information, though several experts were reluctant to endorse any of them because the numbers can vary widely based on geography, individual companies or other factors. But they aren't a bad place to start. I quickly perused the Web site Glassdoor.com, which receives salary information anonymously from employees, and their figures seemed realistic (at least for my profession in New York).
PRACTICE Before you approach your boss, summarize the main points you'd like to make, practice your delivery with a partner and envision what sort of response you might get. The more you prepare, experts said, the less anxious you are likely to be.
And if you happen to be the nervous type, consider taking some cues from the school of Method acting, where you draw upon emotions you've felt in the past. ''You need to take a time where you felt confident and entitled and bring that into the present moment,'' said Professor Pfeffer, who teaches the approach in his ''Paths to Power'' class. ''If you believe you don't deserve a raise, then the odds that anyone else believes you is about zero.''
HOW YOU ASK Threats and ultimatums should be avoided, a point made by most of the gurus I spoke with. Your boss is more likely to try to find the money if you make clear that you are happy to be part of the company. ''It is also important that they express a clear understanding of the realities of the economic situation and how it is impacting the organization as a whole,'' said Jane T. Schroeder, a career counselor in Milwaukee, who suggested presenting yourself as a solution to some of these concerns. ''It should be a win-win conversation.''
And women need to be especially careful with their approach. Research has shown that women who ask for more money are perceived as less attractive than their male counterparts. So it's especially important for women to frame their requests in the context of the greater good for the organization. ''It is also true that stress and scarcity will lead people to rely more on rules of thumb and stereotypes,'' said Iris Bohnet, director of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
PREPARE FOR REJECTION You should have a back-up plan in case your request is rebuffed. ''You also want to anticipate some of the obstacles that the boss will throw back at you and develop some answers to those prior to the conversation,'' said Ms. Schroeder.
So if your employer can't, or won't, provide a raise right now, ask yourself what else might help improve your job satisfaction. More vacation time? Other intangibles? Or, steer the conversation so that it's ''about how we can enhance the role to warrant a higher range,'' Ms. Schroeder said.
Even a disappointing result could have a positive outcome over the long run, because you've opened the lines of communication, which can help build your relationship with your boss.
It's also important to try to maintain some perspective, since these situations have the potential to poke some holes in your self-esteem. ''We take it personally,'' Mr. Zwell said, ''when a whole lot of the time it is not personal.''

HEADLINE: Legal Education Reform

 BODY:
American legal education is in crisis. The economic downturn has left many recent law graduates saddled with crushing student loans and bleak job prospects. The law schools have been targets of lawsuits by students and scrutiny from the United States Senate for alleged false advertising about potential jobs. Yet, at the same time, more and more Americans find that they cannot afford any kind of legal help. 
Addressing these issues requires changing legal education and how the profession sees its responsibility to serve the public interest as well as clients. Some schools are moving in promising directions. The majority are still stuck in an outdated instructional and business model.
The problems are not new. In 2007, a report by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching explained that law schools have contributed heavily to this crisis by giving ''only casual attention to teaching students how to use legal thinking in the complexity of actual law practice.''
Even after the economy recovers, the outsourcing of legal work from law firms and corporate counsel offices to lower-fee operations overseas is likely to continue. Belatedly, some law schools are trying to align what and how they teach to what legal practice now entails and what individuals and institutions need -- like many more lawyers who can serve as advocates for the poor and middle class.
Instead of a curriculum taught largely through professors' grilling of students about appellate cases, some schools are offering more apprentice-style learning in legal clinics and more courses that train students for their multiple future roles as advocates and counselors, negotiators and deal-shapers, and problem-solvers.
With new legal issues arising from the use of computers in business and government to manage information, some schools are teaching students software code as well as legal code to solve systemwide problems. Some are exploring ways to reduce tuitions and make themselves more sustainable. Potential business models include legal degrees based on two years of classes, followed by third-year apprenticeship programs.
In American law schools, the choice is not between teaching legal theory or practice; the task is to teach useful legal ideas and skills in more effective ways. The case method has been the foundation of legal education for 140 years. Its premise was that students would learn legal reasoning by studying appellate rulings. That approach treated law as a form of science and as a source of truth.
That vision was dated by the 1920s. It was a relic by the 1960s. Law is now regarded as a means rather than an end, a tool for solving problems. In reforming themselves, law schools have the chance to help reinvigorate the legal profession and rebuild public confidence in what lawyers can provide.

HEADLINE: Amid a Housing Shortage, a North Dakota Oil Boom Creates Camps of Men

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
TIOGA, N.D. -- As much as the drilling rigs that tower over this once placid corner of the prairie, the two communities springing up just outside of town testify to the galloping pace of growth here in oil country.
They are called man camps -- temporary housing compounds supporting the overwhelmingly male work force flooding the region in search of refuge from a stormy economy. These two, Capital Lodge and Tioga Lodge, built on opposite sides of a highway, will have up to 3,700 residents, according to current plans.
Confronted with the unusual problem of too many unfilled jobs and not enough empty beds to accommodate the new arrivals, North Dakota embraced the camps -- typically made of low-slung, modular dormitory-style buildings -- as the imperfect solution to keeping workers rested and oil flowing.
But now, even as the housing shortage worsens, towns like this one are denying new applications for the camps. In many places they have come to embody the danger of growing too big too fast, cluttering formerly idyllic vistas, straining utilities, overburdening emergency services and aggravating relatively novel problems like traffic jams, long lines and higher crime. 
The grumbling has escalated despite the huge influx of wealth from the boom, largely because it has become clear that growth is overwhelming capacity. Indeed, local leaders note incredulously that a conference on regional infrastructure took place in Colorado last month because the region lacked the facilities to host its own event.
''We need a little time to catch our breath to figure out what resources we need in place before we keep expanding,'' said Ward Heidbreder, city coordinator in nearby Stanley, which has two camps.
In recent weeks, Williams County, where thousands of previously approved camp beds have yet to be built, and Mountrail County, where one-third of the population is living in temporary housing, imposed moratoriums on man camp development. McKenzie County, where the growth had been particularly untamed thanks to the absence of any zoning rules, is even considering breaking with a century of tradition and requiring building permits.
Leaders in these communities say they will use the reprieve to draft new fees for the camps to support fire and ambulance services; write tighter rules, like background checks, for residents in these facilities; and require performance bonds to ensure that the modular buildings aren't simply abandoned whenever the boom turns bust. But the timeout also simply reflects lost patience.
''There is a testiness that's developed in this last year because it's so intense,'' said E. Ward Koeser, the longtime mayor of nearby Williston, with about 14,000 people, the largest city in the region.
Brian Lash, chief executive of Target Logistics, the largest operator of man camps, boasts that the company plans to house 1 percent of the state's population within a year, and supports the moratoriums.
Target's camps, which rent directly to the drilling, hydraulic fracturing and trucking companies that employ most workers, have strict prohibitions on alcohol, firearms and unauthorized women. Violators are evicted and, often as a consequence, fired by the companies. With the employers paying $100 and up per worker per night for housing, good behavior is ensured, Mr. Lash said.
Mr. Lash said that communities should require such strict rules for other operators, as well, to prevent future problems.
''There is a little bit of a backlash that has culminated in these moratoriums,'' he said. ''They're trying to catch their breath and ask for a little more regulation, as they should.''
A few years ago, when the oil boom was in its infancy, these long-shrinking communities were doing anything to encourage development. Now the state population is growing, money is pouring into communities and the unemployment rate remains by far the lowest in the nation, even though more job seekers arrive every day.
Confident that a bust is not imminent -- industry leaders insist that they will continue drilling for years, if not decades -- community leaders who were once deferential to the industry are increasingly comfortable insisting that development slow down a bit.
''Five years ago, anything the industry wanted it got. Anything to move things forward. That's changed,'' said Robert Harms, the former president of an oil producers' trade association who now works as a consultant. ''The industry needs to recognize that they're guests here. They're operating in people's front yards and backyards and they damn well better act that way.''
''But,'' he added, ''locals need to recognize that newcomers are also struggling.''
Those newcomers include Ryan Nordstrom, who rolled into town not long ago with a dozen empty cans of energy drink in his passenger seat and $11 in his pocket, the meager remainder of the fuel money his sister had given him when he left Michigan. He had no trouble finding work -- one of his first jobs was building camps -- but housing was elusive.
He had enough cash to dump all his clothes and buy a brand new wardrobe, but Mr. Nordstrom was forced to live in vagabond style, often sleeping in the back of his car. This month he landed a new job working on an oil rig that included free housing at a camp. He walked into his tiny room in a trailer for the first time with an air of celebration, saying he never imagined how hard it would be to find a place to sleep.
That concern, that people are still arriving despite the housing shortage, is shared by some local leaders, including law enforcement officials who warn that people could die if they try to live in vehicles or other makeshift facilities through the North Dakota winter. But the large paychecks, often totaling more than $100,000 a year, mean that some undoubtedly will take the risk.
Motel rooms in Williston are booked solid, sometimes for years. Rents have quadrupled, and building permits have increased sixfold. Many people are so pressed for a place to stay that they commute two or more hours each day. The lucky ones will get spots at the camps.
More reminiscent of a college dorm than a bunkhouse, most of the camps serve three meals a day, have their own security, and come with amenities like workout rooms, game rooms and laundry service. Typically residents work rotations of two weeks in the camp and then have one week at homes scattered around the country, getting a new room each time they return to the camp.
Dropping off a bag of oil-stained work clothes in his small but private room, Shawn Mallimo said the amenities at the camps vary dramatically -- his last camp had four men and two beds per room, with people working and sleeping in shifts.
The camps are built to be temporary -- concrete is rarely poured. ''The idea is when the majority of the work force leaves, these can be picked up and moved,'' said Jill Edson, a planning official for Williams County. ''So the land can be reclaimed like they were never there.''
At Black Gold, one of a series of camps just outside Williston, interlocking modular units that will house 900 workers when completed are being trucked in and reassembled after serving the oil fields in Alaska. The company is experienced and its rules are less restrictive. The men who have moved in are allowed alcohol in rooms and a few live here with their wives.
The assistant manager, Ann Marie Nowaczyk, whose presence reflects some hard-earned wisdom that nobody keeps a bunch of men on good behavior like a woman, says that she rarely has to use her ''mom voice'' to stifle trouble. Mostly people come back exhausted, eat and go to bed, she said, then start another 12-hour shift. ''I think a lot of people in town think of oil field workers as trash,'' she said. ''They're just like anybody else, working their butts off.''
Law enforcement and building inspection officials say most camps have not been problematic, but there have been exceptions. One camp outside Williston was shut down for allowing sewage to flow freely over the property. Others have had fights. Unauthorized encampments are easy to spot along country roads.
Some companies have responded to the criticism. Capital Lodge, which is still under construction, has been drilling wells to provide its own water supply. Across the highway, Tioga Lodge has a waste treatment facility so the owner will not have to continue trucking sewage to surrounding communities. Both moves were warmly welcomed by local utilities.
As more projects to increase the capacity of local sewer, water, electric, roads and law enforcement are completed -- already hundreds of millions have been spent -- officials expect to lift the moratoriums on the camps.
But even then, Tom Rolfstad, who is in charge of economic development for Williston, said that he would like to see more permanent housing, which he believes would encourage more newcomers to bring their families. ''There is a bit more testosterone right now than the town was used to,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fair Pay for Hard Work

 BODY:
Something akin to justice may finally be at hand for the nation's nearly two million home care aides.
It has been four years since the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against Evelyn Coke, who then was a 73-year-old home care aide for the elderly who had sued her employer -- a for-profit agency -- for years of unpaid overtime. No one disputed that Ms. Coke had worked extra hours for no extra pay. But a 1974 regulation defined home care aides as ''companions,'' like teenage baby sitters, a definition that exempts home care agencies from having to pay the federal minimum wage or time-and-a-half for overtime. 
The justices appeared sympathetic to Ms. Coke, whose work for the elderly included helping to feed, dress and move them, in addition to keeping house. But they ruled that only the Labor Department or Congress had the power to change the companionship regulation.
Washington then dragged its feet on the issue, in part, because the plight of home care workers was mired in the broader debate over health care reform. But the Office of Management and Budget recently agreed to conduct a financial assessment of a proposal from the Labor Department to change the companionship exemption. That is a good sign. The budget office, which must perform an assessment before a proposal can move forward, could have turned down a request for review if it had objected to the proposal.
The exact content of the proposal will not be known until it emerges from the budget office. To be effective, a new rule must state clearly that home care aides are not excluded companions and that agencies that hire them must abide by established federal labor protections.
That would be a victory on several fronts. Home care workers, most of whom are female, low-income and minorities or immigrants, would get long-denied legal protections. Better pay and hours would reduce their broad reliance on food stamps and other public assistance.
Critics will no doubt argue that federal labor protections for home care workers will drive up the cost of Medicaid, which covers many home care bills. Denying overtime is not an acceptable way to keep costs down. It's also economically flawed.
Unless home care labor standards are improved, the industry's chronic problems with recruitment and retention will continue. That will undermine the effort to expand the use of home care in place of costlier alternatives, like nursing homes. The Office of Management and Budget and the Labor Department should waste no more time and advance the new rule.

HEADLINE: For Black Friday Novices, It Was Perhaps Not a Night of Conversion

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and CHRISTOPHER MAAG; Reporting was contributed by Julie Creswell in New Jersey, Steven Yaccino in Illinois, Rebecca Fairley Raney in California and Robbie Brown in Georgia.

 BODY:
They were the Black Friday novices: people who, drawn by the earlier-than-usual store openings or economic necessity, decided to try their hands at shopping on the busiest day of the retail year.
The shoppers found good deals, like a $14.88 waffle iron and 40 percent off Ann Taylor Loft apparel. But assessing their initial Black Friday excursions later, many first-timers did not seem to think it was worth braving the crowds.
And while most malls and stores were packed but relatively calm, in California, a woman pepper-sprayed fellow Wal-Mart shoppers, apparently to keep them from grabbing an Xbox she wanted. Two other Wal-Mart shoppers, in San Leandro, Calif., and Myrtle Beach, S.C., were shot in the stores' parking lots, while police arrested shoppers who were fighting over products in Wal-Mart stores in Milford, Conn., Rome, N.Y. and Kissimmee, Fla.
One first-time Black Friday shopper, Debra Banks, 48, was jostled by crowds when she entered a Toys ''R'' Us in New Jersey and missed out on the limited-edition coupon books. She left the store with nothing. ''Well, I can't say this is fun,'' she said. ''Enlightening, maybe.'' 
Shopping on the Friday after Thanksgiving, a custom that is tradition to some and puzzling to others, got a new twist this year with several stores opening as early as 9 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Analysts said that retailers were aiming for customers who might have limited budgets and trying to appeal to people who would rather stay awake late than awaken for a 4 a.m. opening.
The first numbers on Friday's sales results are not available until Sunday, but many malls and stores said they were seeing more visitors than last year. Macy's Herald Square estimated that 9,000 people were waiting for its midnight opening, versus 7,000 when it opened at 5 a.m. last year. The earlier starting times seemed to bring out younger consumers who wanted to extend their Thanksgiving Day revelry by checking out the bargains. But many first-time Black Friday shoppers seemed puzzled by the fuss.
Ms. Banks, a nurse from Beech Island, S.C., was in New Jersey visiting relatives, and left their house at 7:40 Thursday evening to go shopping with her daughter-in-law and granddaughter.
''This year is different because the stores are opening up earlier,'' she said. ''I think it's going to be great fun.''
So Ms. Banks climbed into the front seat of her daughter-in-law Kylie's Chevrolet Impala, with her granddaughter Cora, 11, sitting in the back. The three of them planned their route. Cora, whose nickname at school is ''Coupon Cora,'' had particularly strong ideas about what deals they should focus on. They decided to start at a Lawrenceville, N.J., Toys ''R'' Us in time for its 9 p.m. opening.
The drive was quick, but when they arrived at 8, the line was already halfway around the building.
''Look at that line!'' Ms. Banks said. ''I just never expected there would be so many people here. And they don't even open for another hour. C'mon, grab your bags, because we're getting in!''
Outside the store, employees, along with two Pinkerton detectives, tried to keep the crowds calm. ''So let's just have everybody be respectful of everybody and it'll all be O.K.,'' a store worker told the crowd on the sidewalk.
As the doors opened, customers broke into jogs and Ms. Banks was left empty-handed and a little discouraged. The group then headed to the Lawrenceville Wal-Mart, where shoppers were polite, with a lot of ''excuse me's'' as people bumped into one another.
''At least we're not part of all those people going back for electronics,'' Ms. Banks said. ''That looks scary. This is a little crazy.''
The women walked out with a play kitchen for $49, a desk chair for $39 and the $14.88 waffle iron. As Ms. Banks wheeled the shopping cart out to the car, she could barely see around the big box containing the kitchen play set.
But while she got some bargains, Ms. Banks said she would not go back to a big-box store next year. ''This is fun, but it's a little too much for me,'' she said.
Some first-time Black Friday shoppers said the tough economy had made getting deals a necessary part of buying Christmas gifts and for everyday staples.
In Dawsonville, Ga., Meredith Blinder, 23, a photographer, met her sister, Elizabeth McDermott, 21, and a cousin at an outlet mall. All first-time Black Friday shoppers, the women said they wanted to watch the frenzy, and liked the late-night opening time.
Ms. Blinder, who recently got married, said she and her husband cut coupons and used generic goods instead of name-brand items. She said the deals she got at the mall, like 40 percent off on a sweater and scarf from Ann Taylor Loft, helped her budget, too.
''If you're saving money on shopping, you can reallocate that to other things,'' she said.
At the Times Square Toys ''R'' Us just after 10 p.m. on Thursday, Yasmin Santiago and Dexter Valles were trying to fit several boxes of diapers into a small hand cart. The couple, parents of twins, said the special on diapers was worth the late-night trip, since Ms. Santiago was on leave from her job as an assistant teacher.
''We have twice the children, and half the income,'' Mr. Valles said.
In the early morning, at the Woodfield Mall outside of Chicago, Roberto Melendez sank onto a bench and rubbed his eyes. He had been up for hours, first to get a television for $250 off at Wal-Mart, and then to this mall, for $7 T-shirts from Aeropostale.
''Now, we really are just trying to make it work somehow, so at least we can have a Christmas of some kind,'' he said, explaining that he lost his job as a union electrician in February and is still unemployed.
In a downtown Chicago Best Buy, as a small group of Occupy Chicago protesters shouted about consumerism, a neighborhood resident, Ellie Fox, 72, said the new opening time and years of curiosity drove her to try her first Black Friday. ''It was on my bucket list,'' said Ms. Fox, who had hoped to get a Samsung laptop for $300. ''I'm just an old woman looking for a good deal.''
But when she got inside the store, fought her way through the crowded aisles, and found that the laptop she wanted had already sold out, she immediately announced her retirement from Black Friday shopping. ''I tried it,'' she said. ''Why do it again?''

HEADLINE: China Looks Into U.S. Energy Trade Policies

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's ministry of commerce announced on Friday that it had opened an investigation into whether American subsidies and other policies in the solar, wind and hydroelectric sectors had unfairly hurt the industrial development of China's renewable energy industries. 
The announcement comes two weeks after the United States Department of Commerce said that it had accepted a request by SolarWorld Industries America and six other companies in the United States for an investigation into whether Chinese solar panel manufacturers had obtained export subsidies from the Chinese government, or had dumped solar panels in the United States for less than it cost to manufacture and distribute them.
The Chinese ministry said in a statement on its Web site that its investigation would end by May 25. That could allow the ministry to retaliate if the Commerce Department imposed punitive tariffs on shipments as part of either its antidumping investigation, for which a decision is due by mid-March, or as part of the antisubsidy investigation, for which a decision is due by mid-May.
The China Photovoltaic Industry Alliance, a government-controlled industry alliance, said on Monday that it was considering a request to the Chinese commerce ministry for an antidumping investigation into American shipments to China of polysilicon, the main ingredient needed to make conventional solar panels. But the commerce ministry announced on Friday that it had accepted a request for a far broader investigation from the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, as well as from the new energy chamber of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
American exports to China in the solar, wind and hydroelectric sectors are tiny. China set very high requirements for local content in solar panels or wind turbines but abandoned the standards in 2009, when the Obama administration pointed out that local content rules violated World Trade Organization rules. By that time, both sectors had grown strong.
American companies have also had limited success in exporting hydroelectric equipment to China. Almost all hydroelectric dams are built in China by state-controlled companies that have shown little interest in buying foreign wares.
W.T.O. rules are particularly stringent in banning export subsidies of the sort that China is alleged to have introduced to become the world's dominant manufacturer of solar panels and wind turbines. But the W.T.O. also bans countries from setting domestic policies that discriminate against imports, although its rules set a high burden of proof that such policies have the effect of limiting imports.

HEADLINE: The Death of the Fringe Suburb

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER B. LEINBERGER. 
Christopher B. Leinberger is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor of practice in urban and regional planning at the University of Michigan.

 BODY:
Washington
DRIVE through any number of outer-ring suburbs in America, and you'll see boarded-up and vacant strip malls, surrounded by vast seas of empty parking spaces. These forlorn monuments to the real estate crash are not going to come back to life, even when the economy recovers. And that's because the demand for the housing that once supported commercial activity in many exurbs isn't coming back, either.
By now, nearly five years after the housing crash, most Americans understand that a mortgage meltdown was the catalyst for the Great Recession, facilitated by underregulation of finance and reckless risk-taking. Less understood is the divergence between center cities and inner-ring suburbs on one hand, and the suburban fringe on the other. 
It was predominantly the collapse of the car-dependent suburban fringe that caused the mortgage collapse.
In the late 1990s, high-end outer suburbs contained most of the expensive housing in the United States, as measured by price per square foot, according to data I analyzed from the Zillow real estate database. Today, the most expensive housing is in the high-density, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods of the center city and inner suburbs. Some of the most expensive neighborhoods in their metropolitan areas are Capitol Hill in Seattle; Virginia Highland in Atlanta; German Village in Columbus, Ohio, and Logan Circle in Washington. Considered slums as recently as 30 years ago, they have been transformed by gentrification.
Simply put, there has been a profound structural shift -- a reversal of what took place in the 1950s, when drivable suburbs boomed and flourished as center cities emptied and withered.
The shift is durable and lasting because of a major demographic event: the convergence of the two largest generations in American history, the baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) and the millennials (born between 1979 and 1996), which today represent half of the total population.
Many boomers are now empty nesters and approaching retirement. Generally this means that they will downsize their housing in the near future. Boomers want to live in a walkable urban downtown, a suburban town center or a small town, according to a recent survey by the National Association of Realtors.
The millennials are just now beginning to emerge from the nest -- at least those who can afford to live on their own. This coming-of-age cohort also favors urban downtowns and suburban town centers -- for lifestyle reasons and the convenience of not having to own cars.
Over all, only 12 percent of future homebuyers want the drivable suburban-fringe houses that are in such oversupply, according to the Realtors survey. This lack of demand all but guarantees continued price declines. Boomers selling their fringe housing will only add to the glut. Nothing the federal government can do will reverse this.
Many drivable-fringe house prices are now below replacement value, meaning the land under the house has no value and the sticks and bricks are worth less than they would cost to replace. This means there is no financial incentive to maintain the house; the next dollar invested will not be recouped upon resale. Many of these houses will be converted to rentals, which are rarely as well maintained as owner-occupied housing. Add the fact that the houses were built with cheap materials and methods to begin with, and you see why many fringe suburbs are turning into slums, with abandoned housing and rising crime.
The good news is that there is great pent-up demand for walkable, centrally located neighborhoods in cities like Portland, Denver, Philadelphia and Chattanooga, Tenn. The transformation of suburbia can be seen in places like Arlington County, Va., Bellevue, Wash., and Pasadena, Calif., where strip malls have been bulldozed and replaced by higher-density mixed-use developments with good transit connections.
Reinvesting in America's built environment -- which makes up a third of the country's assets -- and reviving the construction trades are vital for lifting our economic growth rate. (Disclosure: I am the president of Locus, a coalition of real estate developers and investors and a project of Smart Growth America, which supports walkable neighborhoods and transit-oriented development.)
Some critics will say that investment in the built environment risks repeating the mistake that caused the recession in the first place. That reasoning is as faulty as saying that technology should have been neglected after the dot-com bust, which precipitated the 2001 recession.
The cities and inner-ring suburbs that will be the foundation of the recovery require significant investment at a time of government retrenchment. Bus and light-rail systems, bike lanes and pedestrian improvements -- what traffic engineers dismissively call ''alternative transportation'' -- are vital. So is the repair of infrastructure like roads and bridges. Places as diverse as Los Angeles, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Charlotte, Denver and Washington have recently voted to pay for ''alternative transportation,'' mindful of the dividends to be reaped. As Congress works to reauthorize highway and transit legislation, it must give metropolitan areas greater flexibility for financing transportation, rather than mandating that the vast bulk of the money can be used only for roads.
For too long, we over-invested in the wrong places. Those retail centers and subdivisions will never be worth what they cost to build. We have to stop throwing good money after bad. It is time to instead build what the market wants: mixed-income, walkable cities and suburbs that will support the knowledge economy, promote environmental sustainability and create jobs.

HEADLINE: Millions Spent In Albany Fight To Drill for Gas

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Energy companies have been pouring millions of dollars into television advertising, lobbying and campaign contributions as the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo enters the final phase of deciding when and where to allow a controversial form of natural gas extraction that is opposed by environmental groups.
Companies that drill for natural gas have spent more than $3.2 million lobbying state government since the beginning of last year, according to a review of public records. The broader natural gas industry has been giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaign accounts of lawmakers and the governor. And national energy companies are advertising heavily in an effort to convince the public that the extraction method, commonly known as hydrofracking, is safe and economically beneficial.
Environmental groups, with far less money at their disposal, are mounting a more homespun campaign as they warn that hydrofracking -- a process in which water mixed with sand and chemicals is injected deep into the ground to break up rock formations and release natural gas -- could taint the water supply and cause untold environmental ruin. 
One environmental group held a Halloween contest in which participants were asked to design costumes for drill rigs. And, claiming Mr. Cuomo is rushing the approval process for drilling by collecting public comments for 90 days, environmentalists delivered 180 water-powered clocks to the governor's Capitol office, representing the number of days they are asking him to allow for people to weigh in.
The activity on both sides of the debate is intensifying as New York conducts four public hearings across the state, beginning Nov. 16 in Dansville, a rural community in the Finger Lakes region, and winding up next week in TriBeCa.
Interest in the issue is so widespread that Joseph Martens, the state environmental conservation commissioner, said people have taken to stopping him on the street in the Albany suburb where he lives.
''It's very, very intense; there's no question about it,'' Mr. Martens said in a recent interview. ''And it's part of a national debate.''
Mr. Cuomo, whose first effort to field questions online from residents was swamped by the hydrofracking issue, is pleading for both sides to be patient.
''I know that the temperature is high,'' he said recently. ''We have a process. Let's get the facts. Let the science and the facts make the determination, not emotion and not politics.''
The lobbying push in New York follows similar efforts by the energy industry to influence lawmakers and regulators in Washington and in other parts of the country that are rich in shale formations. Several other states, including Texas, Pennsylvania and Ohio, have also seen millions of dollars in spending in recent years by drilling companies on lobbying, campaign contributions or both.
Much is at stake as the Cuomo administration seeks to develop hydrofracking regulations: proponents say the industry could create jobs and spending in some of the most economically struggling parts of the state, especially its Southern Tier, while environmentalists warn of risks to water quality and damage to roads. And industry estimates suggest that allowing hydrofracking in New York State could generate billions in revenue for energy companies.
''What we are seeing is the concerted application of really a substantial amount of money to try to move public policy into a pro-fracking stance,'' said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, which has raised concerns about the environmental impact of hydrofracking. ''It is a tremendous amount of pressure on our state government.''
The debate over hydrofracking has offered a new test for Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who has declared job creation to be his top priority -- but who has also cast himself as a champion of the environment.
Protesters upset with his handling of the issue have been a fixture at the governor's appearances this year, trailing Mr. Cuomo at the State Fair and staking out an underground convention hall where he had invited former President Bill Clinton to give a speech to business leaders about economic development.
Desperately seeking to attract the attention of lawmakers and regulators, environmentalists are flooding the mailboxes of state officials and editorial page editors, picketing the Capitol and staging theatrical stunts.
''This is something that, because of the scale of drilling that's being looked at, has really captured the public's attention,'' said Robert Moore, the executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York. ''You have people who don't normally identify themselves as environmentalists who suddenly have real concerns about this.''
But the gas-drilling companies' lobbying might has dwarfed that of environmental groups. The money those companies have spent in New York since the beginning of last year is more than four times the roughly $800,000 that the state's most prominent environmental groups have spent on their lobbying efforts.
The hydrofracking issue has created a cottage industry for paid lobbyists, because the gas-drilling industry previously had little business in the capital. One major gas driller, Chesapeake Energy, has spent more than $1.6 million on lobbying over the past three years. In the three years before that, it spent barely $40,000.
This year, Chesapeake has deployed 11 lobbyists to advocate on its behalf, hiring three private companies to buttress the Chesapeake employees given the task of promoting hydrofracking in Albany. As part of its lobbying push, Chesapeake has also paid for television advertisements, in both the Southern Tier and the Capital Region, and a series of roadside billboards in Albany. And the natural gas industry, including not only drilling companies but also distributors and pipeline companies, is making steady campaign contributions to elected officials. The companies and industry groups have donated more than $430,000 to New York candidates and political parties, including over $106,000 to Mr. Cuomo, since the beginning of last year, according to a coming analysis of campaign finance records by Common Cause.
Proponents of hydrofracking are ramping up their campaign: this month, more than a dozen business groups kicked off a coalition, called Clean Growth Now, that is emphasizing the economic benefits of allowing drilling.
The lobbying push in New York comes as part of a broader industry effort to influence public opinion on natural gas drilling and to persuade lawmakers in gas-rich states to look more favorably toward allowing it.
Expensive national advertising campaigns are being waged over the issue by deep-pocketed industry groups, including the American Petroleum Institute. Companies, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, are also paying for television ads that promote the safety of natural gas.
To that end, the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York held community meetings in school auditoriums upstate in recent weeks to answer questions from residents worried about hydrofracking.
''Our mission here has been to try to educate the public that what they're hearing about the risks involved is really overstated,'' said Jim Smith, a spokesman for the association. The meetings, he said, ''are meant to say, 'Listen, it's not as bad as you're hearing.' There are risks involved, but any fuel source has a risk attached to it. We think the rewards outweigh the risk.''

HEADLINE: A New Capital of Call Centers

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Neha Thirani contributed reporting from Mumbai, India.

 BODY:
MANILA -- Americans calling the customer service lines of their airlines, phone companies and banks are now more likely to speak to Mark in Manila than Bharat in Bangalore.
Over the last several years, a quiet revolution has been reshaping the call center business: the rise of the Philippines, a former United States colony that has a large population of young people who speak lightly accented English and, unlike many Indians, are steeped in American culture.
More Filipinos -- about 400,000 -- than Indians now spend their nights talking to mostly American consumers, industry officials said, as companies like AT&T, JPMorgan Chase and Expedia have hired call centers here, or built their own. The jobs have come from the United States, Europe and, to some extent, India as outsourcers followed their clients to the Philippines.
India, where offshore call centers first took off in a big way, fields as many as 350,000 call center agents, according to some industry estimates. The Philippines, which has a population one-tenth as big as India's, overtook India this year, according to Jojo Uligan, executive director of the Contact Center Association of the Philippines. 
The growing preference for the Philippines reflects in part the maturation of the outsourcing business and in part a preference for American English. In the early days, the industry focused simply on finding and setting up shop in countries with large English-speaking populations and low labor costs, which mostly led them to India. But executives say they are now increasingly identifying places best suited for specific tasks. India remains the biggest destination by far for software outsourcing, for instance.
Executives say the growth was not motivated by wage considerations. Filipino call center agents typically earn more than their Indian counterparts ($300 a month, rather than $250, at the entry level), but executives say they are worth the extra cost because American customers find them easier to understand than they do Indian agents, who speak British-style English and use unfamiliar idioms. Indians, for example, might say, ''I will revert on the same,'' rather than, ''I will follow up on that.''
It helps that Filipinos learn American English in the first grade, eat hamburgers, follow the N.B.A. and watch the TV show ''Friends'' long before they enter a call center. In India, by contrast, public schools introduce British English in the third grade, only the urban elite eat American fast food, cricket is the national pastime and ''Friends'' is a teaching aid for Indian call center trainers. English is an official language in both countries.
The Philippines has ''a unique combination of Eastern, attentive hospitality and attitude of care and compassion mixed with what I call Americanization,'' said Aparup Sengupta, chief executive of Aegis Global, an outsourcing firm based in Mumbai, India, that acquired Manila-based People Support in 2008 and now employs nearly 13,000 Filipinos. American companies are reluctant to discuss their outsourcing strategies, but privately some executives acknowledged that early on, they focused primarily on saving money. But as they gained experience in different countries, they realized that was not the best strategy.
''Certain phrases people use and idioms are important,'' said an executive at a large American company that handles service calls through the Philippines. He spoke on the condition that he and his firm not be identified. ''We are getting better at it, but of course it is still a hot button.''
Analysts said call centers in the Philippines appeared to have helped American businesses respond to complaints from consumers who said they could not understand Indian agents. But it is unlikely to satisfy critics who say outsourcing is sending too many jobs abroad as millions of Americans struggle to find work.
This year, for instance, US Airways stopped outsourcing customer service to Manila and hired 400 agents in Arizona, California and North Carolina as part of an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union.
Some American companies like Delta Airlines have said they moved call centers back to the United States to appease angry customers who wanted better English. Entry-level American call center agents earn about $20,000 a year, about five times as much as similar agents in the Philippines and six times as much as Indian agents.
Nevertheless, the financial benefits of outsourcing remain strong enough that the call center business is growing at 25 to 30 percent a year here in the Philippines, compared to 10 to 15 percent in India, according to Salil Dani, research director at the Everest Group, a firm that tracks the market.
American outsourcing or back-end companies like I.B.M., Accenture and Convergys along with Indian firms like Aegis, Infosys and Tech Mahindra have thousands of employees working from gleaming glass towers and even inside malls, which executives say young workers prefer so they can be close to shops and restaurants.
In addition to language skills, the Philippines has better utility infrastructure than India -- so companies spend little on generators and diesel fuel. Also, cities here are safer and have better public transportation, so employers do not have to bus employees to and from work as they do in India.
Many of the workers are like Mark, 26, who answers tech support calls from employees of an American chemical company. He studied engineering but dropped out of college to support his parents and two younger siblings. He now makes 26,000 pesos ($600) a month, about the same as his father, who has a small school-bus business. (The average Filipino family earns 17,000 pesos a month.)
He spoke on the condition that his full name and the name of his employer were not revealed because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. His office is in a new development known as Eastwood City, east of Manila that, locals said, used to be fields a few years ago. Now, it is home to companies like I.B.M. and Dell, and has McDonald's, Starbucks and bars where happy hour starts at 6 a.m. for call center workers who want a beer after their shift.
Mark is trim and has sharp features. He wears stylish canvas shoes and a striped shirt. His accent is more middle America than eastern Manila. He said his parents made him watch American movies and TV shows, read English books and speak the language starting at age 5. Still, he said he was fired from his first call center job after just two weeks because customers said they could not understand him.
''Sometimes, they would insist on being transferred to an American agent,'' he said. ''After a year, I was able to speak in an accent that they would like to hear.''
But now he is tiring of answering phones and is thinking about trying his hand at acting because he has a little money in the bank and his siblings have college degrees and are working.
The call center boom has also benefitted his country, previously a laggard among Southeast Asia's tiger economies -- its most popular exports were nurses. Last year, revenue from outsourcing, which also includes things like health insurance processing, animation development and software programming, totaled $9 billion, or 4.5 percent of the Philippine gross domestic product, up from virtually nothing in 2000. The government has tried to support the industry with tax breaks and subsidies.
In spite of its recent growth, the Philippines is a much smaller destination for outsourcing more broadly -- India earns about 10 times as much revenue from outsourcing. That is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future given India's 1.2 billion people, 31 percent of whom are 14 years old or younger. (The Philippines has 93 million people, about 35 percent of them 14 or younger.)
Executives expect the Philippines to continue growing at a fast pace and move up to higher-value services like accounting or the processing of insurance claims. But, like India, companies are grappling with higher costs and losing their best workers because of high domestic inflation and a shortage of skilled professionals. In the last two years, the Philippine peso climbed nearly 10 percent against the dollar, to 42.14, before weakening recently.
If the peso appreciates to 35 to the dollar, many of the call centers in the Philippines will not survive, said Narasimha Murthy, president of HGS USA, the American arm of an Indian outsourcing company that employs 4,000 people here. But things look upbeat for now, and Mr. Murthy was recently in Manila with a prospective American client.
Five years ago, he said, many clients would ask him if customer calls could be handled in the Philippines. ''From that,'' he said, ''it has gone to 'How well will you do it?' ''

HEADLINE: As Crisis Mounts, Europe's Central Bank Stands Back

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- To some people, the European Central Bank seems like a fire department that is letting the house burn down to teach the children not to play with matches.
The E.C.B. has a fire hose -- its ability to print money. But the bank is refusing to train it on the euro zone's debt crisis.
The flames climbed higher Friday after the Italian Treasury had to pay an interest rate of 6.5 percent on a new issue of six-month bills -- more than three percentage points higher than a similar debt auction on Oct. 26. It was the highest interest rate Italy has had to pay to sell such debt since August 1997, according to Bloomberg News.
But there is no sign the E.C.B. plans a major response, like buying large quantities of the country's bonds to bring down its borrowing costs. The E.C.B. ''is not the fiscal lender of last resort to sovereigns,'' Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, a member of the executive board of the bank, told an audience at Oxford University on Thursday, a view that has been repeated by members of the bank's governing council in recent weeks. 
To many commentators, the E.C.B.'s attitude seems so incomprehensible that they assume the central bank is just putting pressure on politicians to make sure they keep their promises. Rather than let the euro break apart, the thinking goes, the bank will eventually relent and drench the economy with cash as the United States Federal Reserve and Bank of England have done.
But another possibility is that when the E.C.B. says ''no,'' it in fact means ''no.''
''I think markets are going up a blind alley thinking there's going to be a common euro bond or thinking that the E.C.B. is going to act as a lender of last resort,'' Norman Lamont, the former British finance minister, told Bloomberg on Friday. ''I think Germany would rather leave the euro than see the E.C.B.'s integrity affected.''
Instead, the E.C.B. insists, euro area governments must amend their errant ways. ''Governments need to ensure, under any circumstances, the achievement of announced fiscal targets and deliver the envisaged institutional and structural reform programs,'' Mr. Gonzalez-Paramo said in London on Friday.
E.C.B. policy makers have been consistent in arguing that huge purchases of government bonds would violate the bank's mandate and not solve the crisis.
Mr. Gonzalez-Paramo even accused investors of cynical self-interest when they pleaded for a European version of quantitative easing, the use of large purchases of securities to encourage economic growth.
''Market participants that call for the E.C.B. to play this role may care only about the nominal value of their assets and the need to avoid losses,'' he said in Oxford.
To outsiders, it may seem that the E.C.B., based in Frankfurt and steeped in the conservative culture of the Bundesbank, would rather let the euro go up in smoke than compromise its principles. But policy makers do not see the choice in those terms.
To them, the best way to address the crisis is to stick to principles, the most important of which is preserving price stability. That is set out in the first sentence of the statute that defines the E.C.B.'s tasks. ''The primary objective'' of the European system of central banks ''shall be to maintain price stability,'' the statute reads.
E.C.B. policy makers also believe that their charter forbids them from using bank resources to finance governments. If they expanded the money supply to provide debt relief to Italy, policy makers believe, they would be breaking the law. They would also effectively be transferring the debt burden from countries like Greece and Italy to countries like Germany or the Netherlands.
The E.C.B. has been buying Italian government bonds and debt from other troubled countries, but in relatively modest amounts and always on the ground that intervention was needed to maintain control over interest rates and prices.
Mr. Gonzalez-Paramo argued this week that the restriction on E.C.B. action, far from a handicap, was a good thing. It helps policy makers resist the temptation to print money rather than make painful changes.
''The monetary financing prohibition, in this way, is a spur towards better policies and better governance -- in other words, a closer economic union,'' Mr. Gonzalez-Paramo said in the Oxford speech, which encapsulated arguments made by other top E.C.B. officials.
But there might be a situation in which the E.C.B. would intervene significantly in bond markets. If there were credible signs that inflation was coming to a standstill and that deflation threatened, the bank would have a strong justification for pumping up the money supply.
''Things would be very different if the E.C.B. started to think there is a risk of deflation,'' said Eric Chaney, chief economist of the insurer AXA Group. ''In that case, there would be a good reason to buy bonds, to lower interest rates. Then it would be done for price stability objectives, not for saving Country X or Y.''
Inflation in the euro area is 3 percent on an annual basis, still above the E.C.B. target of about 2 percent, though the central bank has forecast that price pressures will ease as the economy slows.
The E.C.B., though formally immune from political influence, would in practice need the approval of European governments, especially Germany, to intervene. Any move would have to be tied to new treaty provisions to enforce greater spending discipline on governments in the future, said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.
For now, opponents of greater bond buying on the E.C.B. governing council appear to hold sway. Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and an influential council member, has been particularly vocal.
If there are members of the 23-member council who favor some form of quantitative easing, they have been quiet about it. But Mr. Gros said support could grow as borrowing costs soar in more countries.
Despite acute tensions on markets, policy makers argue that the crisis is not as acute as it seems, and they refuse to be rushed into making decisions they might later regret.
If the E.C.B. miscalculates, though, the result could be breakup of the euro area. Mr. Gros said it was reassuring that Mario Draghi, president of the E.C.B. since the beginning of the month, seemed to have an impressive grasp of market dynamics.
''He has a lot of experience in the markets,'' Mr. Gros said of Mr. Draghi, an economist who worked briefly at Goldman Sachs before becoming governor of the Bank of Italy and then E.C.B. president.
''I presume Draghi has all the market information in real time at his disposal,'' Mr. Gros said. ''What can we do but trust him?''

HEADLINE: Syria Ignores Arab League Deadline on Observer Mission, Stirring Talk of Sanctions

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI; Hwaida Saad and an employee of The New York Times contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syria on Friday ignored an Arab League deadline to accept observers to oversee a peace deal to end more than eight months of bloodshed, with activists saying that several protesters and soldiers were killed during clashes across the country.
Arab League officials said Thursday that if the government of President Bashar al-Assad failed to agree by Friday to sign a protocol detailing the mission of the observers, Arab finance ministers would meet Saturday in Cairo to discuss imposing sanctions that could include halting flights to Syria, curbing trade and stopping transactions with the country's central bank. 
The new sanctions would deal a severe blow to an economy already suffering under sanctions from the European Union and the United States. Syria's two most vital sectors, oil and tourism, which account for more than a third of the government's revenues, have all but come to a halt.
Turkey announced Friday that its foreign minister would hold talks with foreign ministers from Arab nations in Cairo on Sunday to discuss Syria's failure to admit several hundred military and civilian observers. The monitors' mission was to examine the humanitarian situation in Syria and the execution of an Arab League peace proposal that Damascus agreed to on Nov. 2.
The Anatolia news agency quoted the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, as saying that Turkey already had some measures in hand against Damascus. ''We are going to harmonize them with those prepared by the Arab League,'' Mr. Davutoglu was quoted as saying.
Earlier on Friday, Mr. Davutoglu said that Syria's silence as the deadline passed indicated that it was trying to conceal a worrisome humanitarian situation. ''Syria was expected to say yes to the observers,'' Mr. Davutoglu was quoted as saying. ''Unless there is a reality it hides about the situation.''
Mr. Davutoglu's comments came as the United Nations voiced concerns on Friday about reports of executions and torture of civilians, including children.
The United Nations Committee against Torture described ''rife or systematic attacks'' against civilians, ''including the killing of peaceful demonstrators,'' adding that it was particularly concerned about reports of children being tortured and mutilated during detention. It described Syria's actions as ''gross and pervasive'' human rights violations.
The statement came ahead of a highly anticipated report to be released Monday by an independent commission of inquiry, sponsored by the United Nations, investigating accusations that Syrian armed forces committed crimes against humanity.
The United Nations says that at least 3,500 people have been killed since mid-March in the government's crackdown.
On Friday, at least 16 more people were killed across the country when security forces opened fire at demonstrations, activists said. A majority were in Homs, a city in central Syria that has witnessed some of the largest protests against Mr. Assad.
''We will not give up,'' said Abu Kinan, a shop owner and protester from the Midan neighborhood in Damascus. ''When the Arab League imposes its sanctions, the Syrian economy will collapse, and then the business class and the middle class will join the protests to change the regime.''
The business class and the elite have so far remained largely on the sidelines of the uprising.
The Syrian military also said that 10 of its personnel were killed on Thursday, including six pilots, in an attack on their air force base southwest of Homs.
A military spokesman said, ''This confirms the involvement of foreign elements and their support of these terrorist operations in an effort to weaken the fighting capabilities of our forces.''

HEADLINE: A Great 2-12 Road Trip

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
HAVANA -- Wearing orange jerseys -- well, T-shirts, really -- the Cuban players lined up along the first-base line at Mella Field. We were in blue, along third. All of us held our caps over our hearts, and the Cuban National Concert Band played two national anthems, first the United States', then Cuba's, followed, for some reason, by ''The Pink Panther Theme.''
The flags of both nations were unfurled side by side behind the pitcher's mound, and everyone posed for pictures. Teofilo Stevenson, the former Olympic heavyweight champion and a member of the Cuban Olympic Committee, signed autographs. Gerardo Hernandez, a deputy of the Cuban National Assembly, and John Caulfield, chief of mission of the United States Interests Section in Havana, America's top envoy in Cuba, threw ceremonial first pitches.
''The Cuban people love the North American people,'' Hernandez said to the players and a sparse crowd through an interpreter. ''We welcome you with the love that you deserve.'' 
For his part, Caulfield congratulated the band for its rendition of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''
''It was wonderful to hear it played here,'' he said. ''That doesn't happen very often.''
And then the games began.
So, the United States was clobbered by Cuba in an international softball competition in Havana last week.
What? Didn't hear about it? Not even about my home run? Hmm ... well, here's the scoop:
Two teams of Americans, 23 players total, 22 men and a woman, most from the Eastern Massachusetts Senior Softball League, known as Emass, average age somewhere north of 60 (at 58, I was a little brother), traveled to Cuba in mid-November to play seven games each against local clubs with rosters of equivalent vintage.
It was old guys versus old guys. In other words, an utterly unremarkable circumstance except, of course, that the games took place on the Communist island nation, 90 miles from Key West, whose relations with the United States have been stubbornly frozen for half a century, and which, officially anyway, remains our chilly philosophical enemy.
It was not the first time that an American amateur sports team played in Cuba, and the two nations engaged in a professional baseball exchange when the Baltimore Orioles split a home-and-home series against a team of Cuban all-stars in 1999. But as far as anyone can confirm, the Emass teams, which have made four trips to Cuba since 2009, are the only ones to make regular visits or play repeated series since Fidel Castro led the Cuban revolution and assumed power in 1959.
As an exercise in accidental diplomacy, the remarkable enterprise does not exactly rise to the level of the United States table tennis team being invited to China in 1971, a visit that initiated a thawing of relations between the two superpowers. For one thing, the fields, though perfectly adequate, were about what you would expect from a schoolyard, with hard dirt or scrubby infields and outfields with unruly grass and ruts to be aware of.
For another, the quality of the play was such that very few people cared to watch, and really, who were we? A bunch of older, not especially fit folks with balky joints and slack physiques, retired from or late in careers that are far from sporting. We were businessmen, teachers, musicians. We had an aviation consultant, a lawyer or two, an antiques dealer. Our intrepid distaff team member, Louise Felton, was a retired psychologist, and a pretty solid line drive hitter.
I had been invited to come along by a team member, Glenn Shambroom, one of my oldest friends, who was making his fourth trip to Havana, and not as a reporter, but as a left-handed-hitting outfielder. (I did not have a reporter's visa and agreed to write only about softball-related events so as not to imperil relations between Emass and its Cuban hosts.) Anyway, the idea that our teams were representing our country as athletes -- that I was -- made me feel like one of those foolishly deluded characters in movies by Christopher Guest.
Nonetheless, as the opening ceremony made clear, a frisson of meaning hovered over games, which would ordinarily have all the seriousness of a Sunday beer league. Michael Eizenberg, a player and an American organizer of the tournament, said it was no small thing, involving meeting after meeting with Cuban authorities over several years to arrange for the playing of the national anthem and the display of the American flag.
Eizenberg is president of Educational Travel Alliance, a company based in Wellesley, Mass., which he started in 1998 largely to make arrangements for Americans -- scholars, performers, foundation workers and the like -- to travel to Cuba. Since 2000, when it was licensed by the Treasury Department as a provider of travel services (and thus excepted from the American economic embargo of Cuba and allowed, in a limited way, to spend money there), the alliance has created Cuba sojourns for Oxfam, the Nieman Foundation and the Joyce Theater Foundation, among other organizations.
Eizenberg also happens to be a softball nut, an Emass catcher and second baseman. After President Obama loosened restrictions on travel to Cuba, Eizenberg hit on the idea of applying for a travel permit for a team of American ballplayers under the Treasury Department provision, which allows passage to Cuba for groups participating in a public performance.
''You know, singers, dancers, usually,'' he said. ''But I thought playing softball publicly was a kind of performance.''
The same week we were in Cuba, another team of seniors, from Tampa, Fla., was also there under the aegis of Eizenberg and his company. Several of the players had been members of a youth baseball team from Ybor City, Fla., which had visited Cuba in 1954, a team that included Tony La Russa, the just-retired manager of the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals. While we played slow-pitch softball, they, amazingly, played regular baseball.
''We've got an excess of first basemen and designated hitters,'' said the 67-year-old Paul Ferlitta, who was not yet 11 the last time he played in Cuba.
Eizenberg's dealings with the American government turned out to be relatively easy, compared with his negotiations with the Cuban sports ministry, which passed him off to a subgroup, the Cuban Softball Association. Every step of the way, he encountered the brick walls of bureaucracy.
''I'd have these meetings and tell them what we wanted, and no one would say anything,'' he said. ''Everything was just so opaque. When I asked could we play the national anthem, I'm told that it was finally approved at the highest level of government, but I don't really know.''
But beyond officialdom, our opponents made it very clear that our visit represented a significant event in their lives. Communication was eager, though limited; there was only a handful of moderately bilingual players on either side. But good will was expressed with aching urgency. Hugs and handshakes were frequent, and so was laughter and applause for an opponent's clutch hit or shoestring catch.
On the bus ride back to the city center from a game in the distant Havana neighborhood of Miramar, I sat with one guy I couldn't seem to understand at all until he reached into his bag and offered me a sip from his water bottle, which was filled with rum. We high-fived and gestured at each other for 20 minutes after that, getting across nothing specific but excitement and delight.
The Cuban players, like the Americans, were mostly retired, and their current or former jobs were spread over a wide swath of Cuban society. One had been a candymaker. One was a government administrator. Some had lost their jobs recently because the belt-tightening government has slashed its payroll. Most, like most Cubans, were poor, and in need of, well, stuff.
They gave us small gifts of welcome -- lapel pins, bead necklaces, picture postcards. We brought them bats and gloves and hats, and most of us left our jerseys, our baseball pants and our cleats there, too. They ate several meals with us, including one rather fancy one in Varadero, a beach resort two hours from Havana that is preferred by affluent European tourists. None of the Cuban players had ever even been to Varadero, and not long ago would not have been allowed in the dining room of the hotel where we ate.
Eizenberg asked Tony Gonzalez, the 72-year-old leader of the Cuban team and a former star in Cuban baseball, how it felt for him and his teammates to be there.
''Ennobling,'' he said.
In any case, the privation that pervades life in Cuba, even among the professional class, has to do not only with material goods. Among the warm, lively people I met, there was also a hunger for attachment to the wider world, especially, it seemed to me, to the United States, which is so close, where so many Cubans have relatives, and which shares, of course, their national pastime -- baseball.
''The distance between Cuba and the U.S. is not very long, but for 50 years there was a broken bridge between the two people,'' said Jorge Perez, the manager of a medical technology company and a first baseman with a sweet, left-handed swing that reminded me of Will Clark's. ''Now suddenly a team comes to Cuba to play softball.''
Perez, who is in his early 60s, learned his English, passable but halting, in the 1970s in the Soviet Union, where he studied computer technology, and he speaks it with a slight Russian accent. He has played in all four series against Emass, and he and Shambroom have become close friends.
''Softball, to us, is everything,'' he said. ''We wait all week to play softball. To play against an American team is like a dream. You wake up and you find more players who feel like you about softball. A friendship starts. Immediately we felt we were friends from 20 years.''
O.K., the games. They were played by Emass rules: seven-inning games; 11 players on a team, 5 infielders and 4 outfielders; arc pitching, no higher than 12 feet; a limit of five runs scored in an inning, except the seventh; a foul with two strikes was an out; and no tag plays were allowed at home plate.
Our squad was divided in two, largely by ability -- A and B teams -- and each played seven games, doubleheaders in Havana on Sunday and Monday, a road game in Matanzas, about an hour away, on Tuesday, and another doubleheader on Thursday. That's a lot of softball for our age group and physical conditioning, and by the end, several of us, including me, were hobbling.
I pulled a muscle in Matanzas, and in Thursday's doubleheader I used a pinch-runner whenever I got on and moved from the outfield to third base, where I split time with Roy Andrews, a retired teacher who is awaiting knee replacement surgery. We didn't have the range of one infielder between the two of us. You may have surmised I played on the B team.
The A team, playing against the same opponent every game, was skunked: lost all seven. (No wonder Perez is so glad to see them every year.) It wasn't all that surprising given that several of the Cuban players were former professional ballplayers, including Gonzalez, a shortstop who is still remarkably fleet afoot, and Reinaldo Linares, an outfielder who lived on Long Island as a boy when his father, Rogelio, played in the Negro Leagues for the New York Cubans.
''They called him Ice Cream,'' Linares said. ''He loved ice cream.''
As for us, we played three teams. We faced one much stronger team that hit 10 home runs in a doubleheader, and we lost both games, the second one ending on a double play that belonged on the highlights of ''SportsCenter.'' Its pitcher, a rotund but impossibly nimble man, snagged a blistering line drive and slung the ball, swiftly and nonchalantly, behind his back, perfectly leading the first baseman to the bag and doubling off our astonished runner.
We played one game -- and won it -- against a team whose conditioning seemed to be even worse than ours; at one point the team's best player tripled, and the game had to be halted while he put his head between his legs and waited for his heart to stop racing.
And we played four games against a team against which we were competitive, though, truth be told, we did have a younger Cuban ringer playing shortstop for us. In any case, it was easy to recognize that the Cubans were better schooled in the game than we were. They threw gracefully and to the right base; their fielding fundamentals were solid; and their swings at the plate were controlled and powerful. Most could direct the ball, and they found holes in the infield and gaps in the outfield with regularity.
They seemed a little shocked when they lost the second game of a doubleheader in the bottom of the seventh on a game-ending home run, but they applauded anyway. And then they came back a couple days later and whipped us twice.
I don't know how to say this modestly. I hit the home run, indisputably the greatest competitive moment of my athletic life since I pitched a no-hitter in Little League. Though, of course, there was a balancing moment in our final game when, once again, I came to bat in the seventh inning. Two men were on and two were out, and we were ahead by three, so the game was not exactly on the line, but I could have put it out of reach with an extra-base hit, and we did, in fact, end up losing in the bottom of the inning.
The outfielders were playing me to pull, with a wide gap in left-center, so I tried to line the ball over short, and I hit it well, but I just got under it.
The left fielder sidled over and made an easy catch. As he came in to the infield, laughing, he waggled his finger at me -- No, no, not this time! -- and I laughed, too.
Then he returned my glove, which I was sharing with him.
That's my idea of hands across the sea.

HEADLINE: O.K., Now Ron Paul

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS. 
Charles M. Blow is off today.

 BODY:
Ron Paul, the libertarian congressman from Texas, now seems to have an outside chance of winning the Iowa caucus vote. Not the presidential nomination. It seems highly unlikely that the Republicans are going to give the nod to a guy who disapproves of the Patriot Act and marriage licenses.
But, still, he's definitely having a moment. 
And, therefore, I feel obliged to add him to our survey of presidential candidate book reports.
Just say a prayer Rick Santorum doesn't take off next.
Paul has written a ton of stuff, most of it on his economic theories. His big best seller is ''End the Fed,'' and, if you are interested in abolishing the Federal Reserve, I would really suggest reading it. However, the Fed is not going to be ended. People are not going to be given the power to mint their own money, as Paul also suggests. But, really, if this is what floats your boat, read away.
''Liberty Defined: 50 Essential Issues That Affect Our Freedom'' has more variety. It's full of essays, mostly about things Paul disapproves of, from abortion to Zionism.
It's quite a list. Paul says he believes that the federal government (''the wealth-extracting leviathan state'') shouldn't be doing anything that's not specifically enumerated in the Constitution, which once caused him to vote against giving a Congressional medal to Mother Teresa.
He doesn't really believe in global warming, but, even if he did, he doesn't think government is smart enough to be able to do anything about it.
He also doesn't believe in, well, let's see: gun control, the death penalty, the C.I.A., the Civil Rights Act, prosecuting flag-burners, hate crime legislation, foreign aid, the military draft under any circumstances, campaign finance reform, the war on drugs, the war on terror and the war on porn. Also the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. Taxes are theft. While his fellow Republican candidates fume about gay marriage, Paul thinks the government should get out of the business of issuing marriage licenses entirely. (''In a free society, something that we do not truly enjoy, all voluntary and consensual agreements would be recognized.'')
Paul is the only person running for president in either party who seems determined to be consistent, come hell or high water. The only time I ever saw him dodge a question was when somebody asked him if he preferred letting people die in a ditch to government-financed health care. But, even then, you could tell that he really did prefer the ditch.
Paul can get kind of swoony when he's talking about the rock stars of the Austrian school of economics, but he's not much for personal autobiography. He has a few stories about his childhood in ''End the Fed,'' but they mainly involve the way his stamp and coin collections helped him to understand the concept of currency inflation.
When six of the Republican presidential candidates got together recently for a Family Forum in Iowa in order to woo the social right, they were invited to tell personal stories of their own moments of despair and doubt.
Herman Cain broke down while discussing a bout with cancer. Rick Perry said that Jesus had filled a hole in his soul. Santorum told a moving story about his seriously ill baby daughter, which he then somehow connected to the evils of Obamacare. Paul seemed at a loss, but then he finally offered that when he was in high school he really wanted to be a track star but it didn't work out.
Basically, Paul seems to want to revert to the 18th century, when every bank could set its own monetary policy and every community ran its own schools -- presuming, of course, the community wanted to pay for them.
''The founders of this country were well educated, mostly by being home-schooled or taught in schools associated with a church,'' he reasons. Those of us who were not born in the gentry could presumably go back to sewing and reaping hay.
Naturally, a man with such a wide range of pet peeves is going to make waves in his own party.
''Chicken-hawks are individuals who dodged the draft when their numbers came up but who later became champions of senseless and undeclared wars when they were influencing foreign policy,'' Paul writes in his chapter on conscription. ''Former Vice President Cheney is the best example of this disgraceful behavior.''
Really, you can't totally dislike the guy.

PERSON: Tom Wicker 

HEADLINE: Tom Wicker, Journalist for The Times and Observer of American Politics, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Tom Wicker, one of postwar America's most distinguished journalists, who wrote 20 books, covered the assassination of President John F. Kennedy for The New York Times and became the paper's Washington bureau chief and an iconoclastic political columnist for 25 years, died on Friday at his home near Rochester, Vt. He was 85.
The cause was apparently a heart attack, said his wife, Pamela Wicker.
On Nov. 22, 1963, Mr. Wicker, a brilliant but relatively unknown White House correspondent who had worked at four smaller papers, written several novels under a pen name and, at 37, had established himself as a workhorse of The Times's Washington bureau, was riding in the presidential motorcade as it wound through downtown Dallas, the lone Times reporter on a routine political trip to Texas. 
The searing images of that day -- the rifleman's shots cracking across Dealey Plaza, the wounded president lurching forward in the open limousine, the blur of speed to Parkland Memorial Hospital and the nation's anguish as the doctors gave way to the priests and a new era -- were dictated by Mr. Wicker from a phone booth in stark, detailed prose drawn from notes scribbled on a White House itinerary sheet. It filled two front-page columns and the entire second page, and vaulted the writer to journalistic prominence overnight.
Nine months later, Mr. Wicker, the son of a small-town North Carolina railroad conductor, succeeded the legendary James B. Reston as chief of The Times's 48-member Washington bureau, and two years later he inherited the column -- although hardly the mantle -- of the retiring Arthur Krock, the dean of Washington pundits, who had covered every president since Calvin Coolidge.
In contrast to the conservative pontificating of Mr. Krock and the genteel journalism of Mr. Reston, Mr. Wicker brought a hard-hitting Southern liberal/civil libertarian's perspective to his column, ''In the Nation,'' which appeared on the editorial page and then on the Op-Ed Page two or three times a week from 1966 until his retirement in 1991. It was also syndicated to scores of newspapers.
Riding waves of change as the effects of the divisive war in Vietnam and America's civil rights struggle swept the country, Mr. Wicker applauded President Lyndon B. Johnson and Congress for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but took the president to task for deepening the American involvement in Southeast Asia.
He denounced President Richard M. Nixon for covertly bombing Cambodia, and in the Watergate scandal accused him of creating the ''beginnings of a police state.'' Nixon put Mr. Wicker on his ''enemies list,'' but resigned in disgrace over the Watergate cover-up. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew upbraided Mr. Wicker for ''irresponsibility and thoughtlessness,'' but he, too, resigned after pleading no contest to evading taxes on bribes he had taken while he was governor of Maryland.
The Wicker judgments fell like a hard rain upon all the presidents: Gerald R. Ford, for continuing the war in Vietnam; Jimmy Carter, for ''temporizing'' in the face of soaring inflation and the Iranian hostage crisis; Ronald Reagan, for dozing through the Iran-contra scandal, and the elder George Bush, for letting the Persian Gulf war outweigh educational and health care needs at home. Mr. Wicker's targets also included members of Congress, government secrecy, big business, corrupt labor leaders, racial bigots, prison conditions, television and the news media.
In the 1970s, Mr. Wicker, whose status as a columnist put him outside the customary journalistic restrictions on advocacy, became a fixture on current-events television shows and addressed gatherings on college campuses and in other forums. Speaking at a 1971 ''teach-in'' at Harvard, he urged students to ''engage in civil disobedience'' in protesting the war in Vietnam. ''We got one president out,'' he told the cheering crowd, ''and perhaps we can do it again.''
A Prison Uprising
Mr. Wicker had many detractors. He was attacked by conservatives and liberals, by politicians high and low, by business interests, labor leaders and others, and for a time his activism -- crossing the line from observer to participant in news events -- put him in disfavor with many mainstream journalists. But his speeches and columns continued unabated.
His most notable involvement took place during the uprising by 1,300 inmates who seized 38 guards and workers at the Attica prison in upstate New York in September 1971. Having written a sympathetic column on the death of the black militant George Jackson at San Quentin, Mr. Wicker was asked by Attica's rebels to join a group of outsiders to inspect prison conditions and monitor negotiations between inmates and officials. The radical lawyer William M. Kunstler and Bobby Seale, chairman of the Black Panther Party, also went in, and the observers took on the role of mediators.
Mr. Wicker, in a column, described a night in the yard with the rebels: flickering oil-drum fires, bull-necked convicts armed with bats and iron pipes, faceless men in hoods or football helmets huddled on mattresses behind wooden barricades. He wrote: ''This is another world -- terrifying to the outsider, yet imposing in its strangeness -- behind those massive walls, in this murmurous darkness, within the temporary but real power of desperate men.''
Talks broke down over inmate demands for amnesty and the ouster of Russell G. Oswald, the state corrections commissioner. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller rejected appeals by the observers to go to Attica, and after a four-day standoff, troopers and guards stormed the prison. Ten hostages and 29 inmates were killed by the authorities' gunfire in what witnesses called a turkey shoot; three inmates were killed by other convicts, who also beat a guard to death. Afterward, many prisoners were beaten and abused in reprisals.
Mr. Wicker wrote a book about the uprising, ''A Time to Die'' (1975). Most critics hailed it as his best book, although some chided him for sympathizing with the inmates. ''Attica,'' a television movie starring Morgan Freeman as a jailhouse lawyer and George Grizzard as Mr. Wicker, was made by ABC in 1980.
Fiction and Nonfiction
Mr. Wicker produced a shelf of books: 10 novels, ranging from potboilers under the pen name Paul Connolly to murder mysteries and political thrillers, and 10 nonfiction books that re-examined the legacies of ex-presidents, race relations in America, the press and other subjects.
Mr. Wicker's first nonfiction book was ''Kennedy Without Tears: The Man Beneath the Myth'' (1964), a 61-page look back that some critics said recapitulated popular notions of an orator of charm and wit but did not penetrate the armor of sentiment growing over the dead president.
''JFK and LBJ: The Influence of Personality Upon Politics,'' (1968), was better received. It analyzed the character of the two presidents to explain why Kennedy was unable to push many programs through Congress and why Johnson's credibility was a casualty of the Vietnam conflict.
Mr. Wicker's ''On Press'' (1978) enlarged on complaints he had made for years: the myth of objectivity, reliance on official and anonymous sources. Far from being robust and uninhibited, he wrote, the press was often a toady to government and business.
Published shortly before Mr. Wicker retired, ''One of Us: Richard Nixon and the American Dream'' (1991) offered a surprising reassessment of the president he had scorned 20 years earlier. Nixon, credited with high marks in foreign policy, mainly for opening doors to China, actually deserved more notice for domestic achievements, Mr. Wicker argued, especially in desegregating Southern schools.
Mr. Wicker later wrote ''Tragic Failure: Racial Integration in America,'' (1996), arguing that black Americans should abandon the Democratic Party and forge a new liberal movement. And he produced ''On the Record: An Insider's Guide to Journalism'' (2001), ''Dwight D. Eisenhower'' (2002), ''George Herbert Walker Bush'' (2004) and ''Shooting Star: The Brief Arc of Joe McCarthy'' (2006).
His political novel ''Facing the Lions'' (1973) was on The Times best-seller list for 18 weeks. His later novels were ''Unto This Hour'' (1984), a Civil War story on the best-seller list for 15 weeks; ''Donovan's Wife'' (1992), a satire on sleazy politics; and ''Easter Lilly'' (1998), about a black woman tried for the murder of a white jail guard in the South.
A Young Journalist
Mr. Wicker was a hefty man, 6 feet 2 inches tall, with a ruddy face, jowls, petulant lips and a lock of unruly hair that dangled boyishly on a high forehead. He toiled in tweeds in pinstriped Washington, but seemed more suited to a hammock and straw hat on a lazy summer day. The casual gait, the easygoing manner, the down-home drawl set a tone for audiences, but masked a fiery temperament, a ferocious work ethic, a tigerish competitiveness and a stubborn idealism, qualities that made him a perceptive observer of the American scene for more than a half century.
Thomas Grey Wicker was born on June 18, 1926, in Hamlet, N.C., the son of Delancey David, a railroad freight conductor, and Esta Cameron Wicker. He worked on his high school newspaper and decided to make journalism his career.
After Navy service in World War II, he studied journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1948. Over the next decade, he was an editor and reporter at several newspapers in North Carolina, including The Winston-Salem Journal, eventually becoming its Washington correspondent.
Mr. Wicker married the former Neva Jewett McLean in 1949. The couple had two children and were divorced in 1973. In 1974, he married Pamela Hill, a producer of television documentaries. Besides his wife, he is survived by the children of his first marriage, a daughter, Cameron Wicker, and a son, Thomas Grey Wicker Jr.; two stepdaughters, Kayce Freed Jennings and Lisa Freed; and a stepson, Christopher Hill.
In Washington
In 1957-58, Mr. Wicker was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard, and in 1959 became associate editor of The Nashville Tennessean. In 1960, Mr. Reston hired him for The Times's Washington bureau, one of ''Scotty's boys,'' a cadre of proteges that included Max Frankel, Anthony Lewis and Russell Baker.
Mr. Wicker covered Congress and the Kennedy White House, the 1960 political campaigns and presidential trips abroad. His output was prodigious -- 700 articles in his first few years, many of them on the front page, others in the form of news analysis in The New York Times Magazine or the Week in Review.
His work was often entertaining as well as informative. ''The most familiar voice in Ameriker lahst yeeah warz that of a Boston Irishman with Harvard overtones who sounded vaguely like an old recording of Franklin D. Roosevelt speeded up to 90 r.p.m.'s,'' Mr. Wicker wrote for the magazine, summing up 241 Kennedy speeches in his first year in the presidency. ''Nor will the Beacon Street 'a' and the Bunker Hill 'r' fall any less frequently on the American eeah in the coming yeeah.''
Mr. Wicker was named chief of the Washington bureau on Sept. 1, 1964, at the insistence of his mentor, Mr. Reston, who had asked to be relieved. While the job involved managerial duties, Mr. Wicker was an indifferent administrator. He continued to cover Washington and national news, and to write news analyses and magazine articles. In 1966, he took on Mr. Krock's column, adding to his workload.
In 1968, after complaints by Times editors in New York that Mr. Wicker was devoting too much attention to his writing, The Times announced that James Greenfield, a former Time magazine reporter and State Department official, would replace him as bureau chief.
Mr. Wicker and some colleagues, who saw the move as an effort to rein in the relative independence the bureau had enjoyed under Mr. Reston, vehemently opposed the appointment. The publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, withdrew Mr. Greenfield's name and named Mr. Frankel as bureau chief. Mr. Wicker became associate editor, a title he retained until his retirement, and after 1972 wrote his column from New York.
Besides columns and books, Mr. Wicker wrote short stories and freelance articles that appeared in The Atlantic, Esquire, Harper's, Life, The New Republic, The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, Playboy, Rolling Stone and Vogue. He received many awards and honorary degrees from a dozen universities.

HEADLINE: Banks Build Contingency For Breakup Of the Euro

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Julia Werdigier from London, David Jolly from Paris and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.

 BODY:
PARIS -- For the growing chorus of observers who fear that a breakup of the euro zone might be at hand, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has a pointed rebuke: It's never going to happen.
But some banks are no longer so sure, especially as the sovereign debt crisis threatened to ensnare Germany itself this week, when investors began to question the nation's stature as Europe's main pillar of stability.
On Friday, Standard & Poor's downgraded Belgium's credit standing to AA from AA+, saying it might not be able to cut its towering debt load any time soon. Ratings agencies this week cautioned that France could lose its AAA rating if the crisis grew. On Thursday, agencies lowered the ratings of Portugal and Hungary to junk.
While European leaders still say there is no need to draw up a Plan B, some of the world's biggest banks, and their supervisors, are doing just that. 
''We cannot be, and are not, complacent on this front,'' Andrew Bailey, a regulator at Britain's Financial Services Authority, said this week. ''We must not ignore the prospect of a disorderly departure of some countries from the euro zone,'' he said.
Banks including Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and Nomura issued a cascade of reports this week examining the likelihood of a breakup of the euro zone. ''The euro zone financial crisis has entered a far more dangerous phase,'' analysts at Nomura wrote on Friday. Unless the European Central Bank steps in to help where politicians have failed, ''a euro breakup now appears probable rather than possible,'' the bank said.
Major British financial institutions, like the Royal Bank of Scotland, are drawing up contingency plans in case the unthinkable veers toward reality, bank supervisors said Thursday. United States regulators have been pushing American banks like Citigroup and others to reduce their exposure to the euro zone. In Asia, authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up their monitoring of the international exposure of foreign and local banks in light of the European crisis.
But banks in big euro zone countries that have only recently been infected by the crisis do not seem to be nearly as flustered.
Banks in France and Italy in particular are not creating backup plans, bankers say, for the simple reason that they have concluded it is impossible for the euro to break up. Although banks like BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, UniCredit and others recently dumped tens of billions of euros worth of European sovereign debt, the thinking is that there is little reason to do more.
''While in the United States there is clearly a view that Europe can break up, here, we believe Europe must remain as it is,'' said one French banker, summing up the thinking at French banks. ''So no one is saying, 'We need a fallback,' '' said the banker, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
When Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's second-largest bank, evaluated different situations in preparation for its 2011-13 strategic plan last March, none were based on the possible breakup of the euro, and ''even though the situation has evolved, we haven't revised our scenario to take that into consideration,'' said Andrea Beltratti, chairman of the bank's management board.
Mr. Beltratti said that banks would be the first bellwether of trouble in the case of growing jitters about the euro, and that Intesa Sanpaolo had been ''very careful'' from the point of view of liquidity and capital. In late spring, the bank raised its capital by five billion euros, one of the largest increases in Europe.
Mr. Beltratti said that Italy, like the European Union, could adopt a series of policy measures that could keep the breakup of the euro at bay. ''I certainly felt more confident a few months ago, but still feel optimistic,'' he said.
European leaders this week said they were more determined than ever to keep the single currency alive -- especially with major elections looming in France next year and in Germany in 2013. If anything, Mrs. Merkel said she would redouble her efforts to push the union toward greater fiscal and political unity.
That task is seen as slightly easier now that the crisis has evicted weak leaders from troubled euro zone countries like Italy and Spain. But it remained an uphill battle as Mrs. Merkel continued this week to oppose the creation of bonds that would be backed by the euro zone.
Politically, even the idea of a breakaway Greece is increasingly considered anathema. Despite expectations that Greece -- and the banks that lent to it -- may receive European taxpayer bailouts for up to nine years, officials fear its exit could open a Pandora's box of horrors, such as a second Lehman-like event, or even the exit of other countries from the euro union.
Europe's common currency union was formed more than a decade ago and now includes 17 European Union members, creating a powerful economic bloc aimed at cementing stability on the Continent. It ushered in years of prosperity for its members, especially Germany, as interest rates declined and money flooded into the union -- until the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy sent global credit markets into chaos three years ago and the financial crisis took on new life with the near-default of Greece last year. The creation of the euro zone meant countless interlocking contracts and assets among the countries, but no mechanism for a country to leave the union.
But as the crisis leaps to Europe's wealthier north, banks have been increasing their preparedness for any outcome. For instance, while it would certainly be legally, financially and politically complicated for Greece to quit the euro zone, some banks are nonetheless tallying how euros would be converted to drachmas, how contracts would be executed and whether the event would cause credit markets to seize up worldwide.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is one of many banks testing its capacity to deal with a euro breakup. ''We do lots of stress-test analyses of what happens if the euro breaks apart or if certain things happen, countries expelled from the euro,'' said Bruce van Saun, RBS's group finance director. But, he added: ''I don't want to make it more dramatic than it is.''
Certain businesses are taking similar precautions. The giant German tourism operator TUI recently caused a stir in Greece when it sent letters to Greek hoteliers demanding that contracts be renegotiated in drachmas to protect against losses if Greece were to exit the euro.
TUI took the action just days after Mrs. Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France acknowledged at a meeting earlier this month of G-20 leaders in Cannes, France, that Greece could well leave the monetary union. On Thursday, Greece's central bank warned that if the country failed to improve its finances quickly, the question would become ''whether the country is to remain within the euro area.''
In a survey published Wednesday of nearly 1,000 of its clients, Barclays Capital said nearly half expected at least one country to leave the euro zone; 35 percent expect the breakup to be limited to Greece, and one in 20 expect all countries on Europe's periphery to exit next year.
Some banks are now looking well beyond just one country. On Friday, Merrill Lynch became the latest to issue a report exploring what would happen if countries were to exit the euro and revert to their old currencies. If Spain, Italy, Portugal and France were to start printing their old money again today, their currencies would most likely weaken against the dollar, reflecting the relative weakness of their economies, Merrill Lynch calculated.
Currencies in the stronger economies of Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland would probably rise against the dollar, according to the analysis.
In Asia, banks and regulators view the situation with growing alarm. Norman Chan, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Wednesday that regulators had stepped up their surveillance of banks' exposure to Europe.
Regulators have been working with bank managers on stress tests to determine how the banks' financial stability might be affected by an increasingly severe financial dislocation in Europe, said a Hong Kong banker who insisted on anonymity.
The main danger of a euro breakup, said Stephen Jen, managing partner at SLJ Macro Partners in London, is ''redenomination risk,'' the unpredictable effect that a euro breakup would have on financial assets as newly created currencies sought their own levels in the market and the value of contracts drawn up in euros came into question.
Most people hope that will not happen. ''Remember when Lehman went bankrupt -- nobody could anticipate what happened next,'' said the French banker who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''That was a company, not a country. If a country leaves the euro -- multiply the Lehman effect by 10,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Occupiers Evicted From the New School; Graffiti Is Left Behind

BYLINE: AIDAN GARDINER


HIGHLIGHT: An offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement had taken up in a gallery but violated conditions laid out by the university's president. 

 BODY:
A weeklong occupation at the New School in Greenwich Village ended with a whimper on Friday morning when university officials evicted the handful of remaining protesters from a campus gallery that was defaced sometime before they left.
But the events leading up to that point were uncertain, as some of those who had participated in the occupation said they did not know who the evicted demonstrators were or why slogans were scrawled on the walls of the ground-floor gallery. (One read, "Spoiled New School Anarchists.") 
"I don't understand how people could've painted that and no one notice," said Chris Crews, a graduate student at the New School who participated in the protest. "It's unclear how they even got there."
Senior administrators, including the university's president, David E. Van Zandt, entered the gallery about 9:30 in the morning. They found it covered with graffiti. They also found about five people, some of whom were sleeping. When none of them produced identification, school or otherwise, they were asked to leave, a New School spokesman said.
Most of the people looked like they were more than 30 years old, said a university spokesman, Peter Taback, who accompanied Dr. Van Zandt.
The New School demonstration started at the university's student study center on the second floor of 90 Fifth Avenue, near 15th Street, to protest the escalating costs of higher education. But the school leases the space, and the landlord, a company controlled by the real estate developer Aby Rosen, wanted the protesters out of the building.
Dr. Van Zandt - who was chosen last year as the successor to Bob Kerrey, a former senator from Nebraska and presidential candidate - had offered the nearby gallery, at 2 West 13th Street, as an alternative location, but on the conditions that the protesters not sleep there or scrawl graffiti on the walls, as had been done in the other space. He said, however, that the gallery, which was not displaying any art, would be open 24 hours a day.
Dr. Van Zandt's offer was a controversial proposition within the New School protest, which began on Nov. 17 with about 100 participants after a rally in Union Square and was an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Protesters and their supporters met in the study center Tuesday evening and voted to move to the new space. Some made their way to the gallery on West 13th Street throughout the week, with their numbers fluctuating by the day, but did not spend nights there. A small group of hard-line protesters, however, refused to leave the original space, on Fifth Avenue.
"To occupy a space that was given to us is antithetical to what many of us believe in," said Ian McKenzie, who identified himself as a student at Pratt Institute and was one of the final demonstrators at the study center.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths GOLD, HERBERT Z

 BODY:
GOLD--Herbert Z. (1915-2011), adoring husband and father, and mensch to all who knew him, died in the early morning after Thanksgiving at the age of 96. Born in Brooklyn, Herb, graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, where he played piccolo in the marching band, and then from NYU Law School. He later joined his father's business building homes and apartment buildings in Rockville Centre and Hewlett Harbor. He was appointed redeveloper as a partner of the firm of Stackler, Frank and Gold to build and complete the Urban Renewal Program for the Village of Rockville Centre, New York, and other projects on Long Island. 
In 1941 he met Rita Weinstein and when he asked which street he should take to drive her home, she told him to take the long way, and they did: He was married to Rita for 67 years before her passing in 2008. Together, they raised their beautiful son Richard, who sadly passed at the age of 35. Herb was a generous benefactor to countless organizations and individuals throughout the world. He established the Rita Gold Early Childhood Centers at Columbia University's Teachers College and in Tel Aviv. Herb funded many scholarships for young Opera singers, as well as for underprivileged students making it possible for them to go on to higher education. He was also a generous donor to The New York City Opera, Julliard, and The Sarasota Opera. Herb lived life to the fullest, inspiring those around him to strive to fulfill their highest potential. He was a kind, soft-spoken man of keen intellect and quick wit. Herb was a philanthropist and active participant in Jewish causes in the US and Israel, and a caring and generous friend to so many. He has left all of us an extraordinary legacy of learning and commitment to service. He will always be in our hearts. He is survived by his brother Ronny and loving cousins in America and Israel. Services will be held graveside on Monday, 12 noon, at The Old Montifiore Cemetery, located off Springfield Blvd. in St. Albans, Queens, New York. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the charity of your choice.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths MCCLURE, DOUGLAS BRYAN

 BODY:
McCLURE--Douglas Bryan. Douglas Bryan McClure Pioneer in the Art of Incentive Negotiation for U.S. Corporations, dies at 63. Bryan McClure of Figure Eight Island, NC, the consummate family man, prominent civic leader, accomplished businessman, and former football standout, passed away at his beloved beachfront home with his family by his side. Bryan was a true renaissance man with a 40+ year career that spanned banking, real estate, education, and economic development. 
While he found success in all of these endeavors, it was in economic development a field he joined in the late 1980's as an economic development director for Northampton County, NC where he was to make his imprint, first in a series of increasingly prominent public sector jobs, including as the Chief Development Officer for the Michigan Jobs Commission, and then in the private sector as the founder of the Blair Group and ROI Consultants. A 1995 profile in the Wall Street Journal described Bryan as a "New Breed of Site Consultant", later capturing his essential spirit in a quoted response to a question about his aggressive negotiating style: "When I see someone without a job, I just ache for them I want to do everything in my power to help." Bryan's work helped create tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment. Well known for his vocabulary, sharp wit, and ability to articulate, Bryan was a sought after public speaker at many national forums. In 1991 he gave the keynote speech at the Global Economic Forum in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While his accomplishments in business, civic leadership, and football will long be remembered, his greatest legacy will be his commitment to family. Bryan was born in Valdese, NC, the son of the late Eris Louise Benfield McClure and Julius Plato McClure. He received a B.A. degree in Geography from East Carolina University and later studied at the Harvard-Kennedy School of Government, focusing on public administration. At East Carolina University, Bryan was the captain of the football team and upon graduation he was invited to play for the Miami Dolphins. Bryan was a former President of the Cape Fear Red Cross, founder of the McClure School of Real Estate, Appraiser, Broker, and active member of the Episcopal Church. He is survived by his wife of 43 years, Kathryn Walters McClure; two sons; Douglas Bryan McClure, Jr. and wife, Anne of Bluffton, SC, and English Blaine McClure and wife Colby of Raleigh, NC; three daughters, Blair McClure Husain and husband Fazle, Sara McClure Peters and husband Ryan, and Sloan McClure Overstrom and husband Alex, all of Manhattan, NY; three brothers, Bruce McClure of Anderson, SC, Greg McClure of Southport, SC, and the late Gary Scott McClure; two sisters, Judy Middleton and Deborah Randal, of Atlanta, GA; eleven grandchildren, Elizabeth, Sara, Charlotte, and Trice McClure of Bluffton, SC; Sloan, Blaine, Walker, and Shields McClure of Raleigh, NC; Harris, Hannah, and Asher Husain of Manhattan, NY; and one more on the way. A private funeral service was held at his family farm, Sweetbriar Farm in Morganton, NC on Friday, November 25. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the St. Jude's Children's Hospital, PO Box 1000, Department 142, Memphis, TN 38148 http://www.stjude.org/

To the Sports Editor:
Re ''Season Tips Off in Location Unlike Any Other,'' Nov. 12: Given the dire condition of the economy and the level of unemployment in this country, it seems rather frivolous for Michigan State and North Carolina to be opening the college basketball season on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier docked in Southern California at a cost of $2 million. Though apparently taxpayer money was not involved, nothing was said about the source of the funding and one must wonder, with President Obama in attendance and addressing the crowd from center court before the game, whether the event had anything to do with his re-election campaign.

 BODY:
SOMETHING URGENT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU
The Life and Works of William Carlos Williams
By Herbert Leibowitz.Illustrated. 496 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $40
William CARLOS WILLIAMS was a furious poetic revolutionary -- furiously working over a lifetime to reinvent American poetry, furious at poetry he considered backward, and at critics and editors who didn't get it. To many, including me, he was the greatest poet of the 20th century. Unlike Eliot and Pound, two of his rivals in importance, he refused to be an expatriate. When Pound wrote him from overseas, urging Williams to leave America, Williams incorporated the advice into a brutally terse and powerful poem in praise of staying home. He spent virtually all his life in Rutherford, N.J., close to the American voices that enthralled him. 
He was determined to make them the basis of a new poetic diction, one that has hugely influenced American poets and poetries since. It's not too much to say he was our Dante, making a distinctively American language out of slang, jokes, complaints and rants. Williams did this by endlessly reworking heavily enjambed line breaks and stanza breaks in exquisitely casual and deceptively ordinary poems -- a red wheelbarrow shining after a rainstorm, a fire engine tearing through city streets, a woman whose body is covered with moles. He did this alone, and largely ignored by the mediocre stars of American literary life. His capacious, rigorously humane work has a delicacy of ear that hasn't yet been surpassed. All this, and poetry was his night job -- his days were spent as hardworking Dr. Williams of North Jersey.
Left-liberal where Eliot was establishment reactionary and Pound openly supportive of Fascism, Williams remained unaligned with any political party. He rubbed shoulders in nearby New York City with many of the major and minor avant-gardists of the time. He lived mostly quietly, staying married to the same woman his whole adult life. Like many other artists, male, female, gay and straight, he also found time for lots of extramarital sex. He told his own story in his autobiography -- a story also recounted in minute detail in Paul Mariani's magisterial 1981 biography, ''William Carlos Williams: A New World Naked.''
Now comes Herbert Leibowitz's cranky, unapologetically self-assertive, infidelity-obsessed, interesting and idiosyncratic book, '' 'Something Urgent I Have to Say to You': The Life and Works of William Carlos Williams.'' Leibowitz, the editor and a co-founder of the venerable journal Parnassus: Poetry in Review, considers Williams's life and work partly thematically, in chapters on family origins, marriage and love affairs, six months abroad, the writing of ''Paterson.'' Many biographies treat artistic creation as a kind of bloodless version of a Caesarian birth, but Leibo/witz is terrific at conveying the confusion, uncertainty and doggedness of the life of the artist intent on discoveries. He can also be elegant in characterizing the cross-over between Williams the doctor and Williams the poet, as when, commenting on the splendid untitled poem from ''Spring and All'' that begins ''By the road to the contagious hospital,'' Leibo/witz notes that Williams was, by this point in his workhorse writing life, listening ''to the acoustic properties of words with the same care and skill he devoted to the beating of a patient's heart.'' That's a comparison entirely enclosed in metaphor -- and a useful way of understanding Williams: Medicine wasn't a fallback position, but a serious calling not subordinate to writing.
Leibowitz admires Williams's prose, calling ''In the American Grain,'' a series of prose portraits of the country's founders, ''his masterpiece.'' But he doesn't communicate special empathy for the poetry or the man, carping at individual poems another critic might treat more holistically as part of working toward discovery. One senses he wishes he'd been around to fix Williams's poems as they emerged. He's entertainingly pugnacious, especially when he knows he's writing against popular opinion, calling ''Asphodel, That Greeny Flower,'' a late love poem to Williams's wife, ''so clumsy that one wonders what was blocking his ear and his critical faculty,'' or finding ''Tract'' -- mock advice on how to conduct a funeral -- to be a harangue full of platitudes.
Leibowitz is fascinated by the poet's sex life, bizarrely devoting a chapter to a non-affair with the flamboyant minor-Dadaist poet Baroness Elsa von Freytag-/Loringhoven. (Williams never actually slept with her -- she had syphilis, and he knew it.) Williams certainly wrote often about love and sex, in and outside marriage. But Leibowitz seems to scold the poet for his failure to conform to bourgeois standards of morality. This leads him to tin-eared readings of poems like the 10-line ''Arrival,'' which describes the poet-speaker ''loosening the hooks'' of a woman's dress, from which ''the tawdry veined body emerges / twisted upon itself / like a winter wind.'' This is an erotic moment that includes the mortal body's reality, with sex and death rolled up together. It's certainly not reducible to a poem about ''guilt and disappointment'' wherein, says Leibowitz, Williams ''behaves like a censorious moralist.'' Biographers should avoid using poems as mirrors.
Leibowitz knows his way around sonics and syntax. But he frequently treats poems merely as windows through which a poet's life can be viewed. In a chapter called ''Poetry as Biographical Evidence,'' Leibowitz writes, ''The biographer can't overlook the examples, sometimes blatant and sometimes disguised, of poets projecting their unconscious feelings on personae.'' Elsewhere, he says Williams ''routinely played slyboots with the reader or squirreled away embarrassing items about his conduct in obscure hiding places.'' Leibowitz seems to think that poets deploy their poems primarily as evidence for biography.
For example, Williams wrote two versions of a poem about his grandmother's death. ''The Last Words of My Grandmother,'' from 1924, is half a description of a callow young cousin staying with the grandmother, and half an account of the grandmother's dying furies and querulous last words, also the last words of the poem: ''What are all those / fuzzy looking things out there? / Trees? Well, I'm / tired of them.'' In the 1939 revision, ''The Last Words of My English Grandmother,'' Williams cuts out the cousin, who, as Leibowitz notes, is easy to read as a self-portrait-by-proxy. The new version focuses entirely on the grandmother and, as Leibowitz also notes, ''Williams's role shrinks to interjection, remonstrance or the reading of stage directions.''
The key question is why: ''Perhaps,'' Leibowitz says, ''he wished to distance himself from his early impudence. Perhaps he realized that by upstaging his dying grandmother in the 1924 version he had distracted the reader.'' In fact, serious poets write and revise their poems according to the necessities of art, not life. Leibowitz ignores this, and ignores a small, important change to the later version's ending. After the grandmother has rasped out, ''I'm tired of them,'' Williams adds, ''and rolled her head away.'' This gives the poet, not the grandmother, the last word, and lets him upstage her all over again. This economical, enriching gesture suggests Williams changed the poem not for extratextual reasons, but because his interests in relation to narrative technique had shifted. To misunderstand this is to misunderstand -- at least partly -- the life.
Finally, a technical complaint: A number of poems quoted in '' 'Something Urgent I Have to Say to You' '' are laid out incorrectly -- poems whose typographical arrangement were a major Williams innovation. This must be a computer formatting error. It's shocking, especially coming from a publishing house as renowned as Farrar, Straus & Giroux, that nobody caught it. Is there really no one in the proofreading department -- as Williams writes about America in his great poem ''To Elsie'' -- ''to witness / and adjust, no one to drive the car''?-h

HEADLINE: For-Profit Certification For Teachers Is Booming

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH and NICK PANDOLFO; Morgan Smith reported from Denton, and Nick Pandolfo from New York.. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
DENTON -- One afternoon in mid-November, Jeff Arrington scattered 80 paper gingerbread men labeled with numbers across the floor of his high school disaster-response class.
The numbers corresponded with the severity of injuries ranging from burns to hysterical blindness. His students had to categorize the ''men'' based on the level of medical attention each required.
Mr. Arrington, in the middle of his third month of teaching at the Advanced Technology Complex in the Denton Independent School District, has a background well suited to the subject. He was a police officer for six years -- he turned in his badge on Sept. 12 and began teaching the next day.
He is earning his teaching certificate through an online, for-profit alternative certification program, a nontraditional route to teaching that is becoming more common in Texas. Such programs, which can offer certification in three months to two years, are booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success. They draw candidates like Mr. Arrington who bring valuable life experience, but there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations. 
More than 110 alternative certification programs -- including iteachTexas, which Mr. Arrington is completing, and nonprofits like Teach for America -- produce 40 percent of all new teachers in Texas, according to an analysis of Texas Education Agency data by Ed Fuller, a Penn State University education professor and former University of Texas researcher.
For-profit programs dominate that market: in each year since 2007, the two largest companies, A+ Texas Teachers and iteachTexas, have produced far more teachers than any other traditional or alternative program. While virtually all paths to the classroom have seen declines since 2003, according to Mr. Fuller's analysis, for-profit alternative certification programs have grown by 23 percent. (While the percentage has increased, the actual number of for-profit alternative certificates granted has decreased since the 2009 economic recession.)
Other states have begun allowing for-profits to enter the alternative teacher training market, but Texas has done so to the greatest extent, according to Emily Feistritzer, president of the National Center for Alternative Certification. Some states, like Illinois, require that any alternative routes to the classroom be connected to the university system.
IteachTexas, begun in 2003, is the first for-profit, non-university based alternative certification program to expand across state lines, with the newly created iteachU.S. operating programs in Louisiana and Tennessee. Additional offshoots will soon come to Michigan and at least two other states.
Diann Huber, president of iteachU.S., said the program's goal is to provide a new career opportunity for people who have been laid off in other industries, like auto workers in Michigan, who may be able to use their knowledge to teach high-need subjects like math and science.
Texas began experimenting with alternative certification programs in the mid-1980s. Then, the state ''didn't regulate who was operating private programs, and people saw that was a way to make a fast buck,'' said Rae Queen, the president of the Texas Alternative Certification Association, who also runs a for-profit alternative certification program in San Antonio. Ms. Queen said the state now has a much more rigorous application and audit process for certification programs. In 2008, the state also instituted a minimum grade-point average of 2.5 for all teaching candidates.
Still, Ms. Queen said the reputation of for-profit programs suffers. ''There are some companies out there that say 'you want to be a teacher, start today,' '' she said, ''and they've done that through their own advertising campaigns.''
Some traditional educators believe that for-profits, which typically charge around $4,000 for a program leading to certification, accept applicants with little regard for demand or how they might perform in the classroom. ''The for-profits will take anyone,'' said Nell Ingram, director of the Dallas Independent School District alternative certification program, adding that her program will not offer courses in subjects that are not in demand.
Principals offer mixed reviews of teachers hired from for-profit programs. Most say those teachers succeed in the classroom at the same rate as traditionally certified ones, but others report that they seem less prepared.
Bettejean Gosnell, who earned her certificate through iteachTexas about seven years ago and teaches special education in Argyle, said she was the alternative certification ''poster child,'' a former Nabisco employee whose busy life drew her to online teacher certification courses. But while she said the program ''worked out perfect'' for her, she said it did not support her once she was in the classroom.
''I remember thinking that I wanted constructive criticism,'' Ms. Gosnell said, ''and I wasn't getting it.''
The state's most recent effort to regulate the industry came in the last legislative session, when Representative Mike Villarreal, Democrat of San Antonio, offered a bill that would require potential teachers to spend at least 15 of the mandated 30 hours of practice teaching in classrooms.
The bill struggled to pass -- in the end, a watered-down version made it through -- because of opposition from some in the forprofit industry, who went after it, Mr. Villarreal said, because of their interest in ''having as much flexibility as possible to deliver a very simple curriculum with limited time commitment'' to process clients.
Vernon Reaser, president of A+ Texas Teachers, testified against the bill at a hearing in March. Mr. Reaser said it could have unforeseen practical consequences that could burden school districts and would not necessarily raise the quality of teachers in the classroom.
Mr. Reaser, who did not return further requests for comment, supported the changes to the bill that ultimately passed.
Evaluating teacher-training programs -- regardless of whether they produce teachers through alternative or traditional routes -- is ''one of the toughest areas to get ahold of,'' said Representative Rob Eissler, Republican of The Woodlands, who has headed the Public Education Committee in the Texas House since 2007.
Mr. Eissler said for-profit programs were no more likely to turn out less-qualified teachers than their nonprofit competitors. ''Like anything else,'' he said, ''there are some that are really good and some that aren't as good as the others.'' He said there is a need for the state to study which programs are getting the best results. Right now, Mr. Eissler said, ''most of what we know is anecdotal.''
The state's recent $4 billion reduction in public education spending has led to hiring freezes and layoffs in many districts. Some in the education community still question whether for-profits will be motivated to produce new teachers without a corresponding demand.
Ms. Queen said her program tries to avoid churning out graduates who will not get jobs by working with school districts to identify their greatest needs. She frowns upon applicants who she senses want to teach because they think it is easy.
''I will tell them they need to go out and substitute teach and spend time in a classroom,'' she said, ''and they end up self-selecting. They'll come back and say, 'This is not at all what I thought teaching would be -- you are right.' ''

HEADLINE: Out of Work, And Trying To Stay Positive

BYLINE: By MATHEW R. WARREN

 BODY:
She had to miss her father's funeral in Jamaica last year because she could not afford to go. Fresh fruits and vegetables are now a luxury. She keeps her hair short, cutting it herself to avoid the expense. Her only new clothing in more two years has been a dress her sister paid for and a $25 blouse she bought for an interview. These are the sacrifices, large and small, that Dionne Henry has had to make since losing her job.
Every morning, Ms. Henry checks her e-mail alerts from the Web site CareerBuilder.com. Then it is on to Monster.com and Indeed.com. Since being laid off in June 2009, Ms. Henry said, she has sent out an average of 50 to 100 resumes a month -- more than 2,000 in all.
Last year, she had two interviews. 
''There's a lot of people in my boat,'' Ms. Henry, 41, said. ''I'm at a disadvantage because I've been out of work so long. They're not looking at my experience anymore; they're looking at my time out of work.''
Of the 14 million people who are unemployed in the United States, the Labor Department reports, nearly 4.5 million of them, like Ms. Henry, have been unemployed for a year or more.
When she lost her job as a receptionist in Chelsea for the record company Wind-Up Records after three and a half years, she had no idea it would be this difficult to find another position. She had more than 10 years of clerical experience and had never had much trouble finding work before.
''There may have been short periods of unemployment, but never anything like this,'' she said.
In between jobs, Ms. Henry, who moved to the United States from England when she was 7, could always depend on assignments from temporary employment agencies. But this time around, aside from a three-month stint performing data entry, temporary jobs have dried up.
''You call them once a week, and they let you know if there is any work,'' said Ms. Henry, who checks in with three agencies regularly. ''It's just, 'No, call next week.' Now they're telling me, 'Call in two weeks.' ''
By the end of 2009, 1.7 million residents employed in clerical and administrative positions when the recession began were no longer working in the field, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many of those jobs have yet to return.
''I've tried to change my approach and look at different avenues,'' said Ms. Henry, who has begun applying for jobs in customer service, at call centers and in retail. Among her many disappointments, she said, was being turned down for a job as a cashier at Sears this year. Ms. Henry said she was in disbelief when told she was not qualified.
''I try to think as positively as possible,'' she said. ''I know something is going to come through for me. I just would like it to come through sooner than later.''
Ms. Henry receives $351 a week in unemployment benefits, which are set to expire in January. She pays $896.51 a month in rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
After she first lost her job, she fell a month behind on rent. Then last year, Ms. Henry, who is single and without health insurance, had surgery to remove uterine fibroids, and she fell behind again. The surgery cost $7,000, and she still owes $5,000.
After her rental debt grew to $3,394.16, Ms. Henry's landlord filed evictions proceedings. A lawyer referred Ms. Henry to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. She received a grant of $1,543.12 from the fund and was able to save $1,851.04 as eviction proceedings dragged out in housing court. A judge eventually ordered her landlord to accept the back rent and to allow her to remain in her apartment.
Today, she does her best to stretch her benefits and keep from falling behind again. ''I'm on a tight budget, no wiggle room,'' she said.
Ms. Henry's No. 1 goal is to find full-time work with a livable wage. She plans to apply to Best Buy for temporary employment during the holiday season and recently was approved for financial aid to return to school. She is considering pursuing a degree in child psychology at Borough of Manhattan Community College.
''I don't want to be sitting at home,'' she said. ''I want to be working. It sounds crazy, but I miss the hustle and bustle of the 4 train.''
''I used to go out every other week to the movies,'' Ms. Henry added. ''I can't do that. It's depressing. But you have to come out of that black hole and tell yourself, 'Something is going to change.' ''

HEADLINE: With a Formula One Race Now Iffy, It Remains Unclear Who Is the Lead Driver

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.
Failure might be just the medicine for Comptroller Susan Combs.
Ms. Combs, an outspoken advocate for Formula One racing in Texas, has been watching a relatively noisy group of people get madder and madder about the state's proposed $250 million contribution to a track being built near Austin. Now the whole project is in peril, and she has laid down the law: no race, no money.
If the races don't come to Texas, the state won't invest the money. And if the state doesn't invest the money, Ms. Combs -- who already has a fair-sized stack of political liabilities piled up -- won't have to talk about using taxpayer money for fancy European racing while financing is cut for public schools. 
That's not a fair presentation of the policy here, but it is how the political rhetoric shapes up.
The policy idea is that the state would put up $25 million a year for 10 years and that it will reap economic development rewards that more than make up for the investment. Lawmakers set up a couple of funds for this sort of thing -- one was used to attract the Super Bowl. The state is not allowed to contribute money, however, unless the comptroller and her economic gnomes certify that the state income generated by sales and other taxes would be larger than the state investment. They also have to show that the income wouldn't have come in had the event not taken place.
Ms. Combs has been all over this deal. She helped push the incentives through the Legislature, and helped get the City of Austin to jump in with seed money. The players include Tavo Hellmund, a former Formula One driver who grew up in Austin -- and the investors Red McCombs, a generous contributor to her political accounts, and Bobby Epstein. And then there's Bernie Ecclestone, a colorful Englishman who runs F1, as it's called.
Those characters are in the final stages of either closing this deal or tearing it to bits -- sort of a supercommittee of open-wheel racing. The state says it will hold its money until there's a race. The track owners have stopped construction, saying they won't start until there's a contract for a Texas race. Mr. Hellmund and Mr. Ecclestone no longer have a contract to bring the race here. Everyone is pointing fingers.
On Dec. 7, the F.I.A. World Motor Sport Council will meet to decide on the 2012 racing calendar and whether there will be a Texas race. New Jersey, meanwhile, is in the wings with plans for an F1 race in 2013, a deal that uses the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop (nice TV) and doesn't include state tax money (nice politics for them; tough comparison for Ms. Combs).
The state money is what took this off the sports pages. Ms. Combs's interest in higher office is what makes it a political issue. She's one of several Republican state officeholders openly looking at the 2014 race for lieutenant governor, and she's smoking the competition in the finance department. She's also under fire.
Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples have been openly critical of her reign as comptroller. Prod them gently and they'll point to her handling of a data breach that left personal information of current and former state employees open to hackers, to her handling of an appliance rebate program, to her recent switch in position on abortion. (She would now allow it only in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk; she historically wanted the decision left to the mother.)
F1 is new to that list of grievances. But it has taken a populist turn in Austin that could be spreading. Mr. Patterson this week asked Attorney General Greg Abbott whether Ms. Combs exceeded her authority by offering state money. The taxpayer financing is under fire, in part because the state budget is a wreck and in part because crony capitalism has taken on a sharp edge. Ms. Combs (and Gov. Rick Perry, who also has signed off on this deal) has received significant financial support from Mr. McCombs, leaving her open to criticism about her official support for this business deal.
If the race comes off and does well financially, she'll look smart. The timing of a successful annual November race couldn't be better for someone in politics. Or worse, if it's a flop. And if there's no race at all -- if Bernie and Red and Bobby and Tavo can't pull it together -- that might be the best politics of all.

HEADLINE: Beat the Wheat

BYLINE: By KEITH O'BRIEN

 BODY:
The singer was a no-show. The Gluten Free Expo in Sandy, Utah -- one of the nation's largest events dedicated to foods untainted by wheat -- was going to have to start without the national anthem. But Debbie Deaver, the expo's founder, didn't have time to worry about that. The song, to be honest, was the least of her problems.
Deaver had slept four hours in the last three days. The 34-year-old woman -- who has celiac disease and therefore must avoid eating gluten, a key protein in wheat -- was running on prayer and Diet Dr Pepper. She needed sleep, and syrup. 
A day earlier, a shipment of maple syrup failed to arrive, forcing her to scramble to find a topping suitable for the expo's enormous gluten-free pancake breakfast. A last-minute donation of 35 cases of marionberry syrup would have to do. And then there was the issue of actual attendees. With the sky spitting rain outside and temperatures hovering around 40 degrees on a dark October morning, Deaver was becoming convinced that no one was coming to her expo in suburban Salt Lake City. ''I'm getting nervous,'' she admitted as she scanned the empty concourse of the sprawling, glass-walled South Towne Exposition Center just 30 minutes before the show started. ''People aren't showing up.''
But seemingly all at once, they did. When Deaver opened the front doors at 9 a.m., she was stunned by the huge crowd waiting to get inside. At the sight of these people -- her people -- Deaver stopped cold in her Puma sneakers and began to cry.
''I'm just so excited about those gluten-free pancakes,'' she announced to the crowd. ''Is everybody ready to eat some pancakes?''
Four hundred people surged into the expo hall in the first 10 minutes, 1,200 in the first hour and nearly 6,000 by the end of the single-day event. They came from as far away as Arizona and Nebraska, like pilgrims to a sort of gluten-free Mecca. Once inside, many were soon listening to one man: Dom Alcocer, a 33-year-old marketing manager, who stood on a chair in an expo booth, barking at the attendees and throwing gluten-free granola bars into the crowd.
''Ohhhhh! Dropped pass!'' Alcocer shouted to one person. And then, to another: ''Nice catch!''
The crest on Alcocer's golf shirt said Gluten Freely, as did the sign above the booth promoting a Web site of the same name. But Alcocer wasn't here representing some Internet start-up. He was from General Mills, the Minnesota-based food-manufacturing giant, which perhaps more than any other mainstream corporation has begun focusing on gluten-free consumers. In the last three years, General Mills -- best known for Cheerios, Betty Crocker and that wheat-filled Pillsbury Doughboy -- has put gluten-free labels on more than 300 products already made without gluten, reformulated the recipes of five Chex cereals, introduced gluten-free dessert and pancake mixes and, most recently, asked Alcocer to make GlutenFreely.com America's go-to Web site for the gluten-free life.
''So General Mills funds you?'' Annika Lovell, the mother of a 6-year-old with celiac disease, asked. ''You're part of them?''
''Yes,'' Alcocer replied. ''We are from Minneapolis. We are General Mills. And we are Gluten Freely -- here to bring everything together in a one-stop shop for you guys.''
''That's awesome,'' Lovell replied. ''I'm so excited.''
Alcocer was excited, too, as usual. The Cornell University graduate was once a captain in the Air Force, where he worked on decoys to confuse enemy missiles and became a Global Positioning System expert who negotiated international treaties on behalf of American interests -- heady, scientific stuff. But this job, he said, is just as important as his former military duties. He's in charge of selling products to a large and once-unknown consumer population: gluten-free America.
''We've got food everywhere,'' Alcocer said from atop his chair at the expo. ''It's coming out of everywhere. You can't slow it down. We won't slow it down.'' He paused and smiled. ''It's like I'm selling cars up here,'' he chuckled. ''How do I get you into a Nature Valley bar today?''
Food companies are always trying to take advantage of the latest dietary trend or health craze. (Low carb, anyone?) But the story of how we got to a place where celiac disease is suddenly mainstream, prevalence rates are rising, perfectly healthy people are opting to eat gluten-free and General Mills is coveting these customers is an especially unlikely business narrative.
I should know. It's a story I've been following for years, ever since I was told I had celiac disease in 1999. I was 26 and until that point healthy. But then I started shedding weight like a sailor lost at sea, and became increasingly gaunt and anemic. So pale, so tired. My doctors told me to prepare for the worst. Cancer, probably. But a biopsy of my small intestine found no tumors in my gut, just withered and destroyed villi. I had celiac disease, a genetic autoimmune disorder. And though it was serious -- the disease, when undiagnosed, has been associated with an increased risk of death -- I would live. My villi, the tiny, fingerlike protrusions in the small intestine that help the body absorb nutrients, would recover as long as I stayed off gluten, found in wheat, and similar proteins in barley, rye and malt.
But I wouldn't eat -- not really. Gluten-free packaged foods -- in which wheat has been replaced by alternative ingredients like rice, sorghum and tapioca flours, among others -- were almost impossible to find in the 1990s. Most of what did exist was dreadful: think cardboard. It was also hard to find people who understood the disease itself. Doctors believed it wasn't much of a problem in this country.
''Nobody really was ready to accept the 1 percent prevalence of celiac disease,'' says Dr. Stefano Guandalini, founder and medical director of the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center, who came to the U.S. from Italy in 1996 and found very little awareness of celiac disease. Even experts ignored it, Guandalini says, noting that a prominent medical textbook published as recently as 1999 questioned how widespread it was. ''The chapter on celiac disease,'' Guandalini says, ''quotes a prevalence of 1 in 10,000 in the U.S. and adds that this is mostly a European condition -- and the prevalence is decreasing. This is the formal, official teaching in '99.''
But Guandalini didn't buy it. And neither did Dr. Alessio Fasano, another Italian who was practicing at the University of Maryland. The genes were here, Fasano recalls thinking, courtesy of our European ancestors, and so was the gluten, a natural component of wheat that provides the elastic qualities that make for delicious baked goods. But the protein is also difficult to digest. And even a healthy intestine does not completely break gluten down. For those with celiac disease, the undigested gluten essentially causes the body's immune system to lash out at itself, leading to malabsorption, bloating and diarrhea -- the classic gastrointestinal symptoms -- but also, at times, joint pain, skin rashes and other problems. In Italy, Fasano routinely saw celiac disease. Surely it was in the U.S. too. Hence, in 1996 Fasano published a paper, asking, in the title, a simple question: ''Where Have All the American Celiacs Gone?''
The same year that he published the paper, he founded the University of Maryland Center for Celiac Research. He started small; Fasano had only one patient the first year. In a 1998 paper, however, he reported that he had randomly screened 2,000 blood samples for the antibodies that typically indicate a diagnosis of celiac disease and discovered that 1 in 250 tested positive.
Still, doubts lingered. So Fasano set out to do a more comprehensive study -- or, as he called it, ''the most insane, large epidemiological study'' on celiac disease in the U.S. to date. More than 13,000 subjects in 32 states were screened for the antibodies. Those who tested positive underwent further blood tests and, when possible, a small-bowel biopsy to confirm the presence of celiac disease. The results, published in 2003, were stunning: 1 in every 133 people had celiac disease. And among those related to celiac patients, the rates were as high as 1 in 22. People were listening now -- and everything about gluten-free living was about to change. ''Believe it or not,'' he says, ''the history of celiac disease as a public health problem in the United States started in 2003.''
As awareness of the disease became more widespread, Fasano expected celiac diagnoses to increase. That, in fact, is what has happened. Since 2009, Quest Diagnostics, a leading testing company, has seen requests for celiac blood tests jump 25 percent. But Fasano didn't anticipate other developments. He now estimates that 18 million Americans have some degree of gluten sensitivity. And experts have been surprised, in general, by the rising prevalence of celiac disease overall. ''It's not just that we're better at finding it,'' says Dr. Joseph A. Murray, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ''It truly has become more common.''
Comparing blood samples from the 1950s to the 1990s, Murray found that young people today are nearly five times as likely to have celiac disease, for reasons he and others researchers cannot explain. And it's on the rise not only in the U.S. but also in other places where the disease was once considered rare, like Mexico and India. ''We don't know where it's going to end,'' Murray says. ''Celiac disease has public health consequences.'' And therefore, it has a market.
Gluten-free products aren't just selling these days; they appear to be recession-proof. According to a recent Nielsen report on consumer trends, the volume of gluten-free products sold in the past year is up 37 percent. Spins, a market-research-and-consulting firm for the natural-products industry, says the gluten-free market is a $6.3 billion industry and growing, up 33 percent since 2009. Niche companies like Amy's Kitchen, Glutino, Enjoy Life, Bob's Red Mill and Udi's Gluten Free Foods are reporting incredible growth.
Major corporations have also been moving into the marketplace: Anheuser-Busch introduced Redbridge, a gluten-free beer, in 2006, and Kellogg rolled out gluten-free Rice Krispies this year. Other companies have begun adding labels that indicate when their products are gluten-free -- that is, when they contain fewer than 20 parts per million gluten (the proposed federal standard). Both Frito-Lay and Post Foods have begun such labeling in the past year. It's the golden age of gluten-free.
Celiacs aren't the only ones who are grateful. Athletes, in particular, have taken to the diet. Some claim to have more energy when they cut out gluten, a belief that intrigues some experts and riles others. Guandalini dismisses the idea as ''totally bogus.'' Yet no one can argue with the success of the world's No. 1 men's tennis player, Novak Djokovic. Within months of revealing this year that he had a gluten allergy and had altered his diet accordingly, Djokovic posted a remarkable 64-2 record. By September, sportswriters barely let a moment pass without asking about, as one called it, his ''off-court eating habits.'' After his victory at the U.S. Open final, a reporter wanted to know what he ate for dinner the night before, for breakfast that morning and what he planned to eat that night. ''I'll give you a simple answer,'' Djokovic said with a smile. ''Last night I didn't have any gluten, and tonight I will have a bunch of gluten.''
The reporters burst out laughing. Some even clapped. It was funny. But celiacs everywhere winced. Djokovic's answer didn't just trivialize the seriousness of their disease. The answer made it official: gluten-free was a full-blown fad. And while that meant more products on the shelves, it also signaled the possibility that this moment might not last.
Back at General Mills in Minnesota, however, Dom Alcocer insists that gluten-free is here to stay. What he sees, he told me, is a growing number of Americans who have no choice but to be gluten-free. Earlier this year, ConAgra Mills, a leading flour supplier, published a report characterizing gluten-free specialty products as a $486 million industry. That's much smaller than the $6.3 billion figure from Spins, but it doesn't include mass-market items like Chex cereals. What's more, David Sheluga, the director of consumer insights at ConAgra Mills, found something significant about who's buying gluten-free specialty products and why. More than 80 percent of the market, he estimated, is being driven by core consumers -- people on the diet for medical reasons. In other words, Sheluga says, even if some occasional customers give up on gluten-free products, it will have little impact on sales. ''That core,'' Sheluga says, ''is not going away.'' These are the customers General Mills set out to reach four years ago when a few employees began floating a radical thought: What would happen if they made Rice Chex gluten-free?
General Mills has for generations boasted about the quality of its wheat flour (''Makes the Bread of Life'') and other wheat-laden products. ''We love gluten,'' Jodi Benson, a longtime General Mills employee, told me when I visited the company's headquarters outside Minneapolis last month. ''We are,'' she added, ''the very best of gluten.''
Still, a senior food scientist named Dean Creighton was willing to try to take the gluten out of Rice Chex when the idea was first raised in late 2007. In nearly two decades at the company, Creighton had never tried to remove gluten from a product. But he had tinkered with cereal recipes. ''That's my job,'' he explained. And he was pretty sure that he could make Rice Chex gluten-free. He just needed to solve the problem of ''brown notes.''
Chex is at its best when it has what experts call brown notes: a toasted flavor and brownish hue. And what contributed to the sweet brown notes was malt syrup, a glutenous ingredient that would end up being replaced by molasses. Just like that, Chex would have a new audience: millions of customers who previously didn't bother to go down the cereal aisle. ''That's a huge opportunity,'' Liz Mascolo, the Chex marketing manager, told me.
As Rice Chex was being reformulated -- it arrived on shelves in 2008 -- the Betty Crocker team was experimenting with gluten-free mixes for cookies, brownies and cakes. ''We were sticking our necks out, because we're General Mills, and we're used to doing things mass -- big -- appealing to everyone,'' says Dena Larson, a marketing manager in the baking division at the time. ''And we knew that we were inherently going against that.'' There were other problems. The early cake recipes fell flat, literally. ''Think of yellow cake,'' Benson says, ''in a brownie height.''
But a thousand batches later, General Mills got it right. Four different mixes, with large gluten-free labels, went on sale just as the cereal division was planning four more gluten-free Chex products: Honey Nut, Corn, Chocolate and Cinnamon. Gluten-free Bisquick pancake and baking mix was in the works, too. Then General Mills asked Dom Alcocer to rebrand the Web presence behind its gluten-free business strategy. Alcocer, in his four and a half years at General Mills, had previously marketed soup and cookies -- he liked his gluten. But once tapped for the job, he lived gluten-free for 40 days and began building GlutenFreely.com.
General Mills reached out to the nation's top experts on the topic -- Fasano/ and Guandalini -- and asked them for medical advice and scientific guidance. The science, Alcocer said, needed to be front and center. Competitors needed to be acknowledged, too; Alcocer believed customers should be able to buy their products on the Web site. And finally, Alcocer and others at General Mills have pushed for greater transparency: detailed ingredient lists showing which products were gluten-free.
It's the sort of thing that worries corporations. When a company labels a product gluten-free, then it absolutely has to be, or the consequences can get ugly. ''We call that the R-word -- recall,'' says Brenda Jacob, General Mills' manager of product labeling and regulatory compliance. ''We don't want to go there.'' But in the end, Jacob listened. General Mills published a list of gluten-free products two years ago and continues to add to it today under the stewardship of Alcocer, who believes the company, not the customer, should bear the ''mantle of anxiety.''
General Mills won't disclose sales figures of its gluten-free products. But in statements to investors, the company has indicated that the strategy is working. Retail sales for Chex cereals, in the first quarter of the 2012 fiscal year alone, are up 29 percent. Meanwhile, Alcocer has been on the gluten-free-expo circuit, visiting half a dozen in recent months. He's not just a guy handing out samples, his colleague Alison Miller says. ''He's a great face,'' she says, ''of General Mills.''
''Hey, everybody! Come on up and grab as many as you like. We've got Nature Valley bars. We've got Larabars. All flavors.''
Alcocer was down off the chair now. But he was still working the crowd at the Gluten Free Expo in Utah, doing what he would later describe as ''the circus-barking thing.'' It's an act. But not entirely. ''We want to be what the brand is,'' Alcocer told me. ''It's energetic, it's positive, it's happy -- it's just living.''
Toward the end of the day, he was embracing people. ''Let's hug this out,'' he told one weepy woman, overjoyed by the products before her. Then Alcocer began to break down the booth, making sure to give away every last item, all the way down to the container of gluten-free chocolate frosting on the table for decoration.
The purpose of attending the expos is to connect with customers. But Alcocer has found a way to do the same thing back in Minnesota too. He often convenes a meeting of what he calls the Gluten-Free Advisory Board -- an official title for a very unofficial group of General Mills employees and on-site contractors who have celiac disease, have children with the disease or are gluten-free for other reasons. During the week of my visit to General Mills, eight women attended Alcocer's meeting. Lunch was served and questions were asked. Alcocer was interested in the holidays. What did they miss? What did they need? How could Gluten Freely make their lives easier?
The women talked about how hard it was to go to holiday parties and find nothing to eat for their children. They discussed the need for better pie crusts. Then one of them, Mary Podvin, raised a subject that resonated with everyone at the table: Casseroles. There was something, Podvin said, about gluten-free Progresso cream of mushroom soup that simply didn't work in the casseroles she loved to make. ''It needs to be -- ''
''Gelatinous!'' answered Dena Larson, from across the table.
''Glue,'' Podvin said with a nod. A gelatinous glue was exactly what cream of mushroom soup typically brought to a good casserole -- and that's what they wanted now from their gluten-free recipes.
''Is that even possible, though?'' Carol Bagnoli, whose 3-year-old son eats gluten-free, asked.
''Anything,'' Alcocer replied, ''is possible.''
The women at the table laughed. The notion that anything is possible isn't one that gluten-free folks hear very often. But Alcocer wasn't joking. It was, he told me after the lunch, ''a holy-moly moment.'' He had no idea that casserole was a problem for his customers. There were, after all, recipes for casseroles on the Gluten Freely Web site. ''But if it doesn't turn out,'' he said now, ''it's no good to anybody. So we're going to go down to the kitchen, and we're going to say: 'We need help. These people need help.' How can we get that can to become that can?'' In other words, how could they get a can of gluten-free Progresso soup to act like the can of condensed soup called for in the recipes that his customers loved? ''There's got to be a way,'' Alcocer said, ''to take this great product and make it work.''
And it was this exchange, perhaps more than any other, that signified, to me, how much the cultural fault lines have shifted. For generations, major corporations have ignored people with food allergies. The goal was feeding the masses.
Now that is changing. Gluten-free foods -- none of which taste like cardboard -- fill my kitchen cabinets and those of millions of other Americans. A niche market is going mainstream. Long before General Mills unveiled its first official gluten-free product, consumers had made their needs known in phone call after phone call to Minnesota. The global trend data were there, laid out before the marketers, and so was the science -- until, finally, it was clear: These customers needed to eat, too, and there was money to be made in feeding them. ''It's millions of people,'' Alcocer told me, ''with nowhere to turn, but us.''

HEADLINE: Tucked Away and Neatly Tricked Out

BYLINE: By JOSEPH PLAMBECK

 BODY:
THE cemeteries that line southern Queens have moonlighted for decades, standing as a natural fence around Glendale, a subdued working- and middle-class neighborhood.
They helped keep the neighborhood relatively isolated. (The lack of a subway or commuter train station helped, too.) And that was not all bad.
''For a long time,'' said Kathy Masi, a 33-year resident of Glendale, ''we were hidden, and it was a wonderful thing.''
But in the last decade or so, change has found its way in. Some old industrial buildings were replaced by well-known retail stores like Trader Joe's and restaurants like Chili's. Traffic increased. People outside the neighborhood started to recognize its name. 
''It's just all part of growing,'' said Ms. Masi, who heads the Glendale Civic Association of Queens. ''Going from industrial to retail is a real upswing.''
So far, however, the evolution has not significantly altered the neighborhood's residential landscape, said Thomas Macaluso, the owner of Macaluso Realty, who has sold homes in the area since 1974. That landscape is mostly made up of restrained one- and two-family houses, and Mr. Macaluso says prices have stayed relatively steady.
But he says he has noticed increased interest from people living in newly sought-after neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where housing prices have increased in recent years.
Not that money is the only motivator. Scott Touwsma and his wife, Michele Lacentra, moved into a three-bedroom two-bath home this summer, paying about $500,000. They moved from Bushwick, Brooklyn, selling a commercial building they owned with apartments upstairs. The move, said Mr. Touwsma, who now works at a nearby Home Depot, was about finding a more family-oriented neighborhood.
He has not been disappointed. In August the family was invited to a block party. Also, around 2:45 each afternoon, the streets fill with children's voices as they make their way home from school.
The family wanted a way ''out of the hustle and bustle,'' Mr. Touwsma said. ''And we found it.''
For about 30 years, Joe Topornycky has lived on the 19th floor of the Forest View Crescent co-op. Some of the transformation has happened just across from his building, as a handful of shops, including a Starbucks, have moved in.
''I liked the area when we first moved in, but it's only gotten better,'' said Mr. Topornycky, 59, who works for the city's School Construction Authority. ''Especially recently, there's been a marked improvement.''
Of the changes, probably none was bigger than the construction of the Shops at Atlas Park, a mixed-use development with a movie theater, stores like Jos. A. Bank and restaurants like California Pizza Kitchen, and office space.
Opened in 2006, the shopping center has struggled along with the economy in recent years. Early this year it was bought at a foreclosure auction by an affiliate of Walton Street Capital, a private investment firm, and Macerich, an owner and operator of shopping centers.
Timothy J. Steffan, the senior vice president for property management at Macerich, which now manages the development, said that plenty of potential remained, in large part because of the neighborhood itself.
''It's a tight community,'' Mr. Steffan said. ''It has a sense of self, a sense of place, a loyalty among its townspeople. You can really do something there that has a sense of place and has legs for the long run.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Inside its cemetery sandwich, Glendale is long and narrow, extending about two miles from west to east and sometimes less than half a mile from north to south.
The borders, residents and agents say, are generally considered Woodhaven Boulevard on the east, Fresh Pond Road on the west. To the north, the line is often drawn along the Long Island Rail Road tracks and Cooper Avenue. The southern line runs along Forest Park and several cemeteries, including Mount Lebanon.
Roughly 30,000 people live here, according to census figures. German-Americans have had a strong presence for more than a century, and in recent decades East European immigrants have gravitated here. There is also a strong Hispanic presence, although blacks and Asians are scarce.
There is an appealing variety of housing, most dating to the first half of the 20th century. Off the main roads like Myrtle, the streets are serene, and many are canopied by large trees.
One-family brick Tudors, both attached and detached, are probably the most exclusive of the homes, but attractive colonials with tiled roofs provide competition. There is also a big supply of semidetached and two-family wood-framed colonials, many with driveways. A few streets are lined with handsome six-family brick buildings.
Just east of Woodhaven Boulevard is Forest View Crescent. A 240-unit building, it converted to co-ops out of the Mitchell-Lama program in 2009.
Joanne Florio, the building's manager, said that 21 units had sold since 2009, and that 11 were now on the market. The apartments, which come in one-, two- and three-bedroom layouts, cost $175,000 to $300,000. Many of the units, like Mr. Topornycky's, have views of both Manhattan and Forest Park.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Considering the housing variety, prices do not vary greatly. In a recent search, Michael P. Tirelli, an owner of Kaye Realty and Development, which has its office in the neighborhood, said that he found 25 one-family homes for sale, ranging from $389,000 to $629,000. He found 46 two-family homes, listed from $385,000 to $779,000.
Prices can be slightly higher in the eastern part of the neighborhood, in what some residents call Upper Glendale. The homes and lots there tend to be somewhat larger, and it is where most of the brick Tudors can be found.
Foreclosures and short sales have remained relatively rare here in recent years, agents said, explaining that the neighborhood had avoided the worst of the real estate downturn.
Lillian Matej, an owner of Cooper and Katz, a local real estate company, said that over all, prices had dropped 10 percent or less since their peak a few years ago. Some pockets of homes, she said, lost much more value, but other pockets lost none at all.
Apartment buildings are uncommon in Glendale, but many rentals are available in the multifamily homes. Mr. Tirelli says one-bedroom apartments rent for $1,000 a month and two-bedrooms for $1,300 to $1,500.
WHAT TO DO
In addition to the Shops at Atlas Park, there are small bakeries and meat markets lining Myrtle Avenue. A stalwart of the neighborhood, Zum Stammtisch, a German restaurant on Myrtle, continues to be a popular destination.
Although the cemeteries provide plenty of greenery, the neighborhood does not really have a park to call its own. But Forest Park and the Forest Park Golf Course are just next door.
THE SCHOOLS
Glendale residents take pride in their schools, particularly Public School 113, which has recently expanded and now teaches through eighth grade. It has about 925 students; in recent state tests, 74 percent of fourth-graders met standards in reading, 89 percent in math, versus 51 and 62 citywide. At Public School 91, which runs through fifth grade, 57 percent of fourth graders met standards in reading, 63 percent in math.
At Intermediate School 119, which serves about 900 students from sixth through eighth grade, 59 percent of eighth graders met standards in reading and 59 percent in math, versus 35 percent and 53 percent citywide.
Queens Metropolitan High School, on the northeast edge of the area, moved into a new building in 2010. It runs only through 10th grade, but is expected to expand. At Forest Hills High School, northwest of the neighborhood, SAT averages in 2010 were 468 in reading, 491 in math and 462 in writing, versus 437, 460 and 432 citywide. There are also several private schools, including Sacred Heart School and Saint John Evangelical Lutheran Elementary.
THE COMMUTE
For those living on the far west side of the neighborhood, the M train is within walking distance at the Fresh Pond Road station. It takes roughly 40 minutes before the train weaves through Lower Manhattan. The L train, at the Myrtle-Wyckoff Avenues station, is also an option, though it is about a dozen blocks farther west.
Many residents drive to work in Manhattan, which can take less than half an hour without traffic. Ms. Masi of the community board works as a paralegal in Midtown, driving a company car, and using company parking.
But since much of the neighborhood is not within walking distance of a train, residents rely heavily on the buses, including the Q55 and Q29. The QM24 and QM25 provide express service to Manhattan during the week, taking 40 to 60 minutes to get to their final stops.
THE HISTORY
German immigrants moved to the area as long ago as the Civil War, farming the land and later opening beer gardens and picnic grounds, according to the Queens Library. Land was used mainly for farming until after World War I, when other industries, including breweries and textile factories, established a presence.

HEADLINE: The Famine Next Time

BYLINE: By SAMUEL LOEWENBERG. 
A Nieman Foundation global health reporting fellow at Harvard. The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting provided a travel grant for the reporting of this essay.

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
THIS past summer I came across a camel that had lost its hump. After a long journey in search of pasture, the beast was swaying beside a brackish well, its ribs and hip bones showing. The hump hung flaccid off its back like a deflated balloon.
I was in northern Kenya, which is suffering through the worst drought to hit the Horn of Africa in 60 years. The toll of deprivation is everywhere. In the village of Kursin, emaciated livestock are collapsing in the middle of town; the local headmaster, Ismael Ali, told me they've ''had a problem with dead carcasses around the school.'' Attendance dropped sharply since the beginning of the year, as many families left the parched region with their flocks, some even crossing into war-torn Somalia in search of food.
American attention to the hunger crisis has focused on the dire conditions of Somalis, but they account for just about a third of the 13 million people affected. According to the United Nations, hunger afflicts 4.5 million people in Ethiopia and 3.75 million people in Kenya, which has about half of Ethiopia's population. An estimated half a million Kenyan children and pregnant or breast-feeding women suffer acute malnutrition. 
The drought has been mounting for a year, but it wasn't until the crisis peaked over the summer that the news media and most international donors took notice. It's a familiar cycle: first come the news media pictures of emaciated infants, followed by conferences on how to do better next time, visits from top-level government officials and large financial commitments from international organizations and even donors like China and the Ikea Foundation. The United States Agency for International Development and the Ad Council have even begun a celebrity public service campaign with the actors Uma Thurman and Josh Hartnett.
This is good news; the assistance is badly needed. Yet the mismatch in timing raises a question that bedevils aid agencies. Unlike earthquakes or hurricanes, droughts and food price increases take time to develop, and the resulting hunger crises are forecast well in advance. From water harvesting to livestock support to cash assistance, there are a plethora of steps that could have significantly ameliorated the current crisis. Why weren't they taken?
This year's drought followed two failed rainy seasons, leaving farmers and herders fragile. When coupled with skyrocketing food and fuel prices, catastrophe loomed. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network, financed by U.S.A.I.D., anticipated it as early as August 2010, and by January the American ambassador to Kenya had declared a disaster and called for urgent assistance.
Although the United States began stockpiling emergency food in the region, that wasn't enough. On June 7, the warning network announced, ''This is the most severe food security emergency in the world today, and the current humanitarian response is inadequate to prevent further deterioration.'' At that time, there were 7 million people in jeopardy. Now, the number is 13 million.
A common misconception is that hunger crises are about a lack of food. Yet there is food in Kenya and Ethiopia, and even in many parts of Somalia. The real issue is poverty. The people affected are poor to begin with; when things turned bad, they had no recourse. In April the World Bank reported that 44 million people worldwide were pushed over the edge by skyrocketing food prices.
Such a perspective is largely missing in our food-aid program. It's like a health insurance system that waits until someone has a full-blown illness before he or she can get treatment. By the end of June, with the crisis in full swing, the United States had committed a total of about $64 million to Kenya, much of it in the form of food supplies (this doesn't include relief for the Somali refugees). But food aid loses at least half of its value, according to the Government Accountability Office, because we ship actual food instead of sending cash for local purchase, like most countries. And only $5 million was allocated to agriculture, nutrition, water and sanitation -- about $1.33 per hungry person -- things that would have helped people during lean times.
Blame politics. Medium- and long-term planning is often the first thing to be cut from an aid budget. After the food price crisis of 2008, when hunger riots erupted around the globe, President Obama got the Group of 8 to promise $22 billion for agricultural development and food security. But many of those commitments have not been met. Meanwhile, this summer Congressional Republicans voted to cut the foreign food aid budget by a third, and more cuts are planned.
And, of course, there is the matter of optics: donors want to see dead babies before they provide significant assistance, one frustrated aid worker told me.
Blame also lies with the Kenyan and Ethiopian governments. In the northern district of Wajir, for instance, by July the central government provided only about half the food assistance that local governments requested, while Ethiopia, according to the BBC, misused aid for political purposes. It is an old story: sending emergency aid is clumsy, and often fraught with problems. As I was leaving a village that depended entirely on delivered water, I passed the water truck the villagers were waiting for, broken down by the side of the road.
Aid officials say they realize that prevention is better than reaction. ''We know how to do this,'' Rajiv Shah, the head of U.S.A.I.D., told me during a trip he made in July to Kenya's Dadaab refugee camp. ''It is one-tenth the cost to provide effective agricultural support and help communities gain food security than it is to provide food aid at a time of famine.''
Our shortsighted response also highlights a misunderstanding about foreign assistance and prevention. ''We are not investing in relatively obvious solutions,'' said Christopher Barrett, an expert on food aid at Cornell University. Those mundane but vital interventions include shoring up the water supply and helping to bolster markets and transportation so that economies continue during lean times. The best assistance, people in Wajir told me, would be a decent road to the south, which would cheapen imports and give them a market for their animals.
DRIVING through Wajir's sandy, arid landscape, we turned the corner to an amazing sight: a green oasis -- a farm, a greenhouse, a well, a water pump, a windmill. Running around were the first happy, healthy-looking children I had seen. This is the Kutulo Farm, a women's cooperative in Wagberi, where they grow kale, cabbage and peppers. They received money for the well from the European Union, but otherwise have done everything on their own. They would like to expand, said Adey Issack, one of the founders, but have no access to credit.
Programs like the Kutulo Farm are significantly cheaper to start and maintain than sending mounds of food aid at the last minute, in large part because they leverage the skills and knowledge of local residents to do the work. The current crisis is a painful demonstration of how well such an approach works: those few communities that received small, well-designed assistance are weathering the drought relatively well.
While recent rain has eased the pressure, much of it will be lost because of a lack of water-collection facilities. And experts warn that so many in Kenya are weakened and destitute that the cycle is expected to start up again in May. In other words, droughts cannot be stopped. But the economics that link drought and famine can be upended, so that next time, the people of Wajir, and dozens of countries around the world, might be able to avoid untold, and unnecessary, suffering.

HEADLINE: College Students Replace Poverty With Creativity

BYLINE: By JENNIFER CONLIN

 BODY:
LIKE so many college students these days, Margaux Malyshev was desperate for cash.
''I did not want to ask my parents for more money,'' said Ms. Malyshev, a sophomore at Northeastern in Boston, where yearly tuition runs $51,000 with room and board. A Craigslist posting for a hair model looked like an easy $250.
There was a catch. ''To earn the $250, I had to let them do anything they wanted to my hair,'' said Ms. Malyshev, who walked in with long, sleek blond tresses and emerged a few hours later a brunette with shaggy bangs and layers. ''From now on, I plan to stick to psychological testing,'' she said, referring to the roughly $20 an hour she often makes filling out university research questionnaires. (''Harvard pays the best in the Boston area,'' she added.) 
There is plenty of pain to go around in this economy. But college students, the generation facing the dual misery of unprecedented tuition levels and grim employment prospects after graduation, are feeling a special sting. As a result, penny-pinching and creative cash accumulation are becoming something like campus sports.
Mira Hager, a sophomore at Macalester College in St. Paul, carries an ample supply of cash from home so she can avoid the $3 withdrawal fees at local A.T.M.'s. She saved $300 by borrowing many of her textbooks from the library, rather than buying them. She also works a campus job nine hours a week as a building manager but has a better plan for next year. ''I plan to work campus events, where you sometimes get free food,'' she said.
Kasey Cox, a junior at the University of Michigan, brings a travel mug of coffee filled with her own home brew to the cafe she likes to study in and pretends she bought it there. She also frequently attends club meetings or seminars that provide refreshments, and she has an eagle eye for special offers. ''On my birthday this year, I hit up five different places in town that give out free things or birthday deals,'' she said.
Grigory Lukin, 25, the author of the 99-cent e-book ''Going to College Without Going Broke,'' recommends student clubs for more than the free food. When he was a student at the University of Nevada, Reno, he joined a community service club that held its annual meeting during spring break. ''Our club had several sponsors, so we ended up paying just $20 each for a three-day weekend in a four-star hotel,'' he said. ''A lot of student clubs have these free, or almost free, trips, but they don't like to advertise them for obvious reasons.''
According to Martin Dasko, 24, the founder of Studenomics.com, a Web site he started as a senior at Ryerson University in Toronto, there is no reason students should not be able to save money in college. ''If students have time for Facebook and TV, they have time for a campus job,'' he said. Mr. Dasko said his Web site gets between 1,000 and 2,000 hits a day, many of them from students asking about online jobs, like tutoring (for that, he recommends studentoffortune.com). ''But I also get a lot of hits from students searching 'free drinking' and 'how to date with no money,' '' he said, laughing.

HEADLINE: A Military Camp Works to Be a Good Neighbor

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
CAMP BULLIS -- Reddish-brown cedar chips from recently cleared trees spread across a patch of ground in this United States military installation, in sharp contrast to the jungle-like growth nearby.
''Before, you couldn't hardly walk through it,'' James Cannizzo, a civilian environmental lawyer for Camp Bullis, said above the faint, distant hum of a giant cedar-eating machine. ''Now, we can have a group of guys do field maneuvers.''
Clearing cedar to expand training areas is a priority for the camp, just north of San Antonio, which helps train all medics in the United States military. Concerns about preserving habitat for the endangered golden-cheeked warbler, which has increasingly sought refuge on the installation's land as San Antonio's suburbs swell, have stymied expansion. 
But a series of deals with the Nature Conservancy, the latest of which was announced this month, is allowing the camp to clear thousands of acres of cedar (though oak trees are spared) inside its boundaries in exchange for permanent preservation of warbler-friendly ranchland outside the installation.
''To me, this is an example of a real win-win-win,'' said Laura Huffman, the Texas director of the Nature Conservancy. The latest deal was financed with $2 million from the Army and $5 million from Bexar County.
Managing endangered species is one of several issues Camp Bullis -- the field training grounds for Fort Sam Houston -- has dealt with as multimillion-dollar homes and other sprawl have encroached. Nearby residents have complained about noise from helicopters and other military operations, and troops worry about nighttime lights.
Recently, camp officials successfully lobbied against plans for a nearby school because, ''Who's going to tell the parents why Johnny hears gunfire?'' Mr. Cannizzo said.
Senator Leticia Van de Putte, Democrat of San Antonio and chairwoman of the Senate's Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, said pressure from developers could be intense, especially given the state's zeal for property rights. However, Ms. Van de Putte argued, addressing encroachment issues is important not only because it supports the military's mission, but also because bases bring in money and jobs.
''We've got to take into account the economic development part of what our bases mean to us,'' she said.
Mr. Cannizzo said Camp Bullis has resolved many of its problems thanks to several steps, including a 2010 San Antonio ordinance requiring better soundproofing for nearby new homes, a mandate for downward-facing lighting near the camp, and the Nature Conservancy agreements (plus another with Texas Parks and Wildlife).
But vigilance is still necessary. During the past legislative session, Mr. Cannizzo fought against bills that would have undercut a San Antonio ordinance that makes it harder to chop down trees near Camp Bullis, because he feared that more warblers could be forced onto the camp. The legislation did not pass.
Other Texas bases also face encroachment issues, even as some prepare to host more returning troops as overseas missions wind down. Many installations are dealing with endangered species, like the warblers (also found at Fort Hood) and the American burying beetle (found at Camp Maxey).
In Bastrop, near the Camp Swift training area, ''we may be right behind Bullis in 10 to 15 years'' because of the area's rapid development, said Col. Robert Crow, commander of the training centers for the Texas Army National Guard.
Challenges relating to energy development have cropped up, too.
Capt. Mark McLaughlin, commander of Naval Air Station Kingsville, said in an e-mail that he spent a ''considerable amount of time'' dealing with the rise of wind farms along the coast, a concern for aircraft radar. Last month, Captain McLaughlin said, the Kingsville installation joined with other military groups, including the Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, to work with wind farms toward compatible development.
Solar farms near runways have also surfaced as a concern at one military installation, Ms. Van de Putte said, because the panels can act like mirrors. However, she said, solar developers can use panels with less glare.

HEADLINE: What Muncie Read

BYLINE: By ANNE TRUBEK. 
Anne Trubek is the author of ''A Skeptic's Guide to Writers' Houses.''

 BODY:
As we lurch into the digital age, people are kicking up hoary generalizations about Americans and their reading habits. ''No one reads anymore,'' ''Kids used to read 'Hamlet,' not 'Twilight,' '' ''We used to have more time to read.'' But these canards are based upon conjecture, anecdote and idealized views of the past. In fact, we know very little about which books Americans used to page through: the history of reading is largely circumstantial, based upon diary entries or sales figures.
So when Frank Felsenstein, a historian of the book at Ball State University, happened to find several unmarked boxes on a shelf in the Muncie Public Library, he was eager to peek inside. Felsenstein discovered crumbling ledgers and notebooks identifying every book checked out of the library, as well as the name of the patron who checked it out, from November 1891 to December 1902 (save a short gap when the library very likely burned the records after a smallpox epidemic). Felsenstein and his colleague James Connolly began cataloging the records, checking the names against census data to provide more patron information and digitizing what they found. 
The resulting database of the Muncie, Ind., library ledgers, ''What Middletown Read'' (www.bsu.edu/libraries/wmr/), is one of the few authoritative records of American reading. It is also doubly representative, because Muncie has long been called America's ''most typical'' town. Muncie became famous for being average in 1929, with the publication of ''Middletown: A Study in American Culture,'' by Robert and Helen Lynd, which remains a landmark of American sociology. The Lynds' close-up account of a class-stratified industrial community was enormously successful -- even the curmudgeonly H. L. Mencken said, ''It reveals, in coldblooded, scientific terms, the sort of lives millions of Americans are leading.'' Today Ball State, located in Muncie, has a Center for Middletown Studies, which collaborated on the reading database.
What do these records tell us Americans were reading? Mostly fluff, it's true. Women read romances, kids read pulp and white-collar workers read mass-market titles. Horatio Alger was by far the most popular author: 5 percent of all books checked out were by him, despite librarians who frowned when boys and girls sought his rags-to-riches novels (some libraries refused to circulate Alger's distressingly individualist books). Louisa May Alcott is the only author who remains both popular and literary today (though her popularity is far less). ''Little Women'' was widely read, but its sequel ''Little Men'' even more so, perhaps because it was checked out by boys, too. The remaining authors at the top of the list -- Charles Fosdick, Oliver Optic, Martha Finley, L. T. Meade and others -- have vanished from memory. Francis Marion Crawford, whose novels were chiefly set in Italy and the Orient, was checked out 2,120 times, whereas Dickens, Walter Scott and Shakespeare circulated 672, 651 and 201 times respectively. Fiction was overwhelmingly preferred, accounting for 92 percent of books read in 1903.
The ''classics'' of American Lit 101 were checked out, too, but not often. Henry James's ''Spoils of Poynton'' was borrowed 54 times between 1897 and 1901. Catherine Gracey, whose occupation was ''Wife of Daniel L., Carpenter,'' and whose occupational rank was ''blue collar,'' checked it out in 1897. (She checked out 67 other books between 1897 and 1901, including an issue of Harper's Monthly and ''The Sin of Joost Avelingh,'' by Maarten Maartens.) None of James's longer novels, including ''The American'' and ''The Portrait of a Lady,'' make it into the database, however. A book of Walt Whitman's poems was donated to the library, but not circulated. James Connolly points out that ''the board of directors sought to shape the collection so that respectable, mostly conservative works predominated. You wouldn't find Marx or the most provocative fiction (think Crane's 'Maggie: A Girl of the Streets') for instance on the shelves.'' Still, Mark Twain's ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' still sometimes banned today, was checked out 149 times. Marie Corelli's quasi-spiritualist potboiler ''The Sorrows of Satan'' was very popular as well.
According to Connolly, blue-collar readers did not especially gravitate to best sellers. Indeed, they were slightly more likely to check out Shakespeare and other classic authors, perhaps, as Connolly speculates, because better-off households already had the books. ''There are enough differences between blue-collar and white-collar readers to suggest meaningful differences between the classes,'' he says. ''That point is further underscored by the decision in 1900 to open a separate Workingmen's Library for the city's laboring classes. The public library, a quiet, fastidious setting run by women, did not suit the needs of workers seeking a smoke and a chat. Nor was it open on Sundays, the workman's only day off.''
In the 1920s, the Lynds found that ''reading in Middletown today means overwhelmingly . . . the reading of public library books,'' and that just ''a limited number of the business class'' ever purchased books. There were only 19 periodicals in the library in 1890, but by 1929 the number was 225, creating, as the Lynds put it, a ''ceaseless torrent of printed matter.'' This ''did not lead to more reading time,'' however. They surveyed business-class women about reading: ''I would read if I only had the energy and quiet,'' one said. ''I just read magazines in my scraps of time,'' another said.
Today, Muncie has 70,000 residents, down from a peak of 76,000 in 1980. Unemployment runs a percentage higher than it does nationwide. There are two library branches, and half of what the Muncie Public Library's patrons check out is nonprint, including audiobooks, DVDs and e-books. While fiction remains more popular than nonfiction, patrons at the wealthier branch check out twice as much nonfiction as readers at the poorer one -- ''Guinness World Records'' tops their list. The director of the Muncie Public Library, Ginny Nilles, says that more than the rise in e-books, she is shocked by the popularity of graphic novels: ''Nothing in my career prepared me for their success. . . . Title for title, they surpass most of our audiovisual items.'' Usage in general is up about 10 percent in 2011 compared with 2010. ''It's the economic downturn,'' Nilles suspects.
When the Middletown database went live in March, Nilles did some browsing. She soon found a bit of her own family history. Her grandmother, Virginia Claypool, was a frequent patron. Nilles is impressed by her grandmother's reading habits. ''She took out a lot of books. She went on to receive a college education, unusual at the time for a woman.'' A search of the database tells more: Claypool chose 171 books between 1891 and 1901. Her first book was Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''Little Foxes,'' checked out when she was 9, and her last was Francis Churchill Williams's ''J. Devlin -- Boss: A Romance of American Politics'' in 1902. In between, she borrowed Kipling's ''Second Jungle Book,'' Sidney Lanier's ''English Novel: A Study in the Development of Personality'' and Mark Twain's ''Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg.''
Her grandmother's highish-brow reading is unusual, and so, Nilles says, is Muncie, despite its nickname. ''Muncie is in the middle of the Rust Belt, and we are having issues here that they don't have in the South or West Coast.'' She believes Muncie was unique in the 1890s, too. ''I think the term Middletown has been a disservice to us. Average is not something to aspire to.''

HEADLINE: The 50-50 Solution

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE euro crisis is deepening, the government in Washington can't cut the deficit or reduce unemployment, and the economy is lurching into recession.
For investors, the course is obvious: Seek safety, and avoid risky assets like stocks.
All of that may seem clear enough. Since August, it has often been the prevailing view in financial markets. But it's not the only narrative, and it hasn't always been the dominant one. 
In fact, another argument has received considerable support lately. It goes something like this: Recent economic data have been surprisingly strong, showing that while the economy is weak, it's not in a recession, at least not in the United States. As for the crises in the euro zone and in Washington, the politicians will just have to come to their senses before the situation really gets out of control.
For investors, the course is obvious: Jump into stocks. Don't miss the big rally.
It may be hard to decide which picture makes the most sense. Perhaps each is appealing, sometimes one more than the other, depending on the news of the particular moment.
These days, paying close attention to the economy and the markets can cause whiplash. What should an investor really do?
In a word, nothing.
When the latest news tempts you to move your investments around, take a deep breath. Unless you need the cash soon, the best course of action may be inaction.
That's the import of a recent study by the Vanguard Group. Assuming you've already set up a diversified portfolio, sitting tight may make the most sense.
Vanguard created a model portfolio divided equally between stocks and bonds, and compared the returns in periods of economic expansion and recession. It found that ''the average real returns of such a portfolio since 1926 have been statistically equivalent regardless of whether the U.S. economy was in or out of recession.''
Vanguard's founder, John C. Bogle, popularized index funds, and the study tracked the stock and bond markets using indexes that mirror the broad markets. Individual stock and bond selection wasn't involved at all.
The study, titled ''Recessions and Balanced Portfolio Returns,'' used the official recession dating of the National Bureau of Economic Research to compare market returns throughout the up and down phases of the business cycle from 1926 through June 2009. During expansions, the model portfolio had average real returns, factoring in inflation, of 5.6 percent, compared with 5.3 percent during recessions.
In short, there was a difference, but it was too small to be of any statistical significance, says Joseph H. Davis, chief economist and head of the investment strategy group at the Vanguard Group and a co-author of the report. (The other author was Daniel Piquet of Vanguard.)
When the economy was bad and when it was good, the portfolio performed more or less the same. It really didn't matter.
''The results may seem counterintuitive,'' Mr. Davis said in a telephone interview. ''You might think that it's best for investors to avoid a recession, and in some ways, of course, it is. No one wants a recession. But the results suggest that as investors, rather than try to time the market, most people are best off with a diversified portfolio and just sticking with it over the long run.''
What accounts for these results? Put simply, bonds tend to outperform stocks when a recession is on the horizon, while stocks tend to rally when an economic expansion is in the offing. ''The financial markets themselves tend to move in advance of the economy,'' Mr. Davis said.
Predicting the economy's direction is famously difficult. So unless you have substantial bond holdings in your portfolio well before a recessions begin, you'll miss upturns in the bond market. And unless you're holding stocks before an economic recovery has started, you'll miss those big rallies.
By holding stocks and bonds in equal proportion -- a portfolio that's easy to construct by using index funds -- you won't need to be prescient; you can stick to your portfolio and ride out the storms.
Of course, a 50-50 stock-bond division is relatively conservative. Alter those proportions and the results will shift significantly. During recessions, for example, a portfolio containing 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds fared worse than the 50-50 portfolio, with an average real return of 4.9 percent annually. In expansions it did better, with an average real return of 6.8 percent, according to Vanguard's calculations.
That points out the allure of market timing. In an ideal world, if you knew in advance where the economy was heading, you'd be a market wizard. You would shift your entire portfolio into stocks during expansions, for example, and put all of it into bonds in recessions. If you could actually do this, the results would be impressive. In expansions, Vanguard found, stocks have gained an average of 11.9 percent annually, after inflation, while the comparable figure for bonds in recessions is 7. 2 percent That kind of timing is ideal.
BUT it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot. Get the timing wrong and hold only stocks in recessions, for example, and you'd have an annual average gain in those periods of 3.3 percent, after inflation. And if you hold bonds in expansions, you'd lose an average annual 0.7 percent, also after inflation.
It may be possible to predict the rough direction of the economy some of the time, but there's no evidence that anyone gets it right all the time. ''I'd be very careful before assuming that I knew better than the overall market,'' Mr. Davis said.
It turns out, though, that if you have a diversified portfolio and are prepared to hold onto it, you may not need to know where the economy is going.
In other words, humility may bring the steadiest returns.

HEADLINE: A Passion for Coaching

BYLINE: By SHARON M. DANIELS. 
As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
I WAS born in Harrisburg, Pa., the oldest of four children. My father owned and managed a gas station. When I was 7, my parents decided that they wanted to live in a warmer place, and decided on South Florida.
We moved to Immokalee, a farming community not far from Naples. My father managed the agricultural supplies store. I attended the local school, where all the students, through high school, were taught on one campus. 
The summer after sixth grade, I wanted to earn some money, so I opened a baby-sitting service in our house. I watched over four, and sometimes more, children a day. At 14, I started working as a waitress at a nearby family-owned restaurant after church on Sundays and during the summers. Back then, no one even thought about a minimum working age. The pay was $1 an hour plus tips.
The next fall, I got a job in a packing house, grading tomatoes -- whether they were too ripe or too green -- to earn money for holiday gifts. I was soon promoted to boxing tomatoes. I had other after-school jobs, working in a men's clothing store, in billing at a water plant and at the local bank, which had an elevator -- now that was something for our one-stoplight town.
After I started college in 1972, first at the University of South Florida then at the University of Florida in Gainesville, I worked at the bank in the summers, mostly filing checks. At the end of the second summer, I was promoted to teller, which was a bigger deal then because the whole town ran on cash. On Fridays, tellers were handling as much as $250,000 in cash to employers to meet their payrolls.
I majored in education and after graduation moved to Orlando. But I couldn't find a full-time job, so I briefly worked as a substitute teacher. A local bank called and offered me a full-time job. I worked there 19 years, starting in Orlando. Over the decades, the bank would merge and become part of a larger network, Southeast Bank, and I was able to realize my passion for coaching others when I joined the bank's training department.
I met my husband, David, who is a C.P.A., when we were working in Orlando. We married in 1980 and had three children: two girls and a boy. Seven years later, we moved when David took a job in Tampa.
In 1991, I joined Kaset International, which marketed customer service training. In 1998, Kaset merged with Learning International and Zenger Miller to become AchieveGlobal, to help companies with leadership development, sales effectiveness and customer service. The next year, 1999, I headed sales for the new company in the Eastern states.
After a year, I took a job as president and chief executive of Communispond, a communications training company in New York. Four years later, in 2004, I returned to AchieveGlobal. The business was rocky after the 2008 recession began, but we are now in more than 40 countries, with a staff of 600 people. Our parent company is the training and events organizer Informa, which is traded on the London Stock Exchange.
We still supply 50 percent of our training in the classroom, but companies are increasingly seeking flexible solutions, like combining learning in class with videos or mobile and tablet applications so employees can learn at their own pace.
Over the years, I've been able to use my skills for volunteer work in crisis counseling and pregnancy counseling. And my coaching and mentoring skills have come in handy in raising our children. I made a list of tasks they should master by age 18, including making their own doctor appointments and mending their own clothes. They seem pretty self-sufficient now, so I guess it worked.

TURNS out the ''House of the Year'' is small, inexpensive to heat, and priced at a surprisingly low $220,000.
A new 1,600-square-foot split-level on Voluntown Road, it is the Builders Association of Eastern Connecticut's answer to a market in which new construction faces stiff competition from the surplus of houses for resale. The prototype is meant to showcase assets rarely found in older homes: ultra-greenness and affordability.
''We wanted to prove that sustainable homes aren't limited to the high end,'' said Andrew J. Gil, the builder, who is with the Mystic River Building Company, in Mystic. ''For entry-level housing, it is more than doable.'' 
The problem, said Paul Stone of Lombardi Realty in Oakdale, the listing agent, is that many buyers don't yet appreciate green technology. ''The hardest thing is trying to educate people about what it is,'' Mr. Stone explained. Despite years of green hype, ''people really don't understand the energy thing -- it's a foreign language.''
Still, as the year is shaping up to be the worst on record for Connecticut's homebuilding industry, builders are looking for anything that might give them an edge in fighting the ''used'' home market. Like Mr. Gil, many are using energy-efficiency to distinguish their homes from older oil guzzlers. Others are hustling harder to find favorable land deals and underserved niches.
Several years of difficult market conditions have thinned their ranks. Membership in the Homebuilders Association of Connecticut is down by a third, to 1,000 from 1,500.
Bill Ethier, the association's chief executive, predicts that the state will tally fewer than 3,000 building permits by year's end, making this the slowest construction year since, well, 2009.
The Eastern Connecticut builders group hopes to stimulate buyer interest with houses that recognize the new economic realities they face. The ''House of the Year'' is ideal for municipal workers, like teachers and police officers, said Chad Whitcomb, the group's president.
''People are still buying houses,'' Mr. Whitcomb said. ''They're just spending a lot less. And an energy-efficient house can compete against the older, existing homes on the market.''
The annual cost for heating and cooling the Griswold house is projected at less than $800. The anticipated savings are largely generated by superinsulated walls and an air source heat pump. Mr. Gil designed a duct system throughout the house to circulate air from the pump efficiently.
Situated on 1.4 acres, the three-bedroom house has sustainable features like bamboo flooring in the open living area, cork flooring in the lower-level den, and water-saving toilets in the two baths.
Houses with similar ''green'' features tend to be priced above $400,000, which makes the Griswold house a particularly good value, said Mr. Stone, the listing agent. But people are ''skeptical when I say $800 a year to heat and cool.''
Roland Skinner, the owner of R. M. Skinner Enterprises, in Orange, has encountered the same hurdle in trying to use energy-efficiency as a selling point for his new homes. He says he has given up on trying to sell the asset as a ''bonus'' -- people tell him they would rather spend the money on a better kitchen. Now he pushes it as a smart investment. But when it came to finding buyers for his three-lot subdivision in Orange, he found that careful market research mattered more.
''Everything presold,'' he said, ''because it's the right price point.''
The three houses are priced in the high $600,000s, which for Orange means a 3,000-square-foot colonial on 1.5 acres. Mr. Skinner settled on that range after his research suggested high demand and not a lot of product.
''We hit the number on the head,'' he said. ''All three sold with backup offers.''
Mark Lovley has almost 40 signed contracts for new homes this year in the greater Hartford area. The owner of Lovley Development, in Southington, Mr. Lovley said he had been buying up odd building lots at good prices, which had enabled him to price his houses more competitively.
''We price our new homes $5,000 to $10,000 below existing homes in these towns,'' he said.
At $339,000, a 1,600-square-foot colonial with three bedrooms represents the low end of what Mr. Lovley is building these days in Southington, Farmington, Watertown and Berlin. The upper end is typically a 2,600-square-foot colonial for $500,000.
He incorporates energy-saving features like high-efficiency furnaces, tankless hot-water heaters, and foam insulation. But many people are won over instead by the ground-floor office, a feature he says about half of his clients are looking for but may not be able to find in older houses.
Mr. Lovley said his company's reputation had also helped sustain him at a time when newer builders were losing clientele. Referrals are a big part of his business. In fact, in a climate in which few builders are willing or able to dabble in speculative building, Mr. Lovley is succeeding at it. He built four spec houses in time for this year's spring market, and sold them all.

HEADLINE: At Harbor, Answering An S.O.S.

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
SUSAN HENSHAW JONES, the new president of the comatose South Street Seaport Museum and the captain, by default, of its deteriorating fleet of historic vessels, dug the heels of her black pumps deeper into the splintered boardwalk at Pier 16, bracing herself against the November wind pirouetting off the harbor.
''Being on the water in New York City is a great thing for any institution,'' she announced, following up with a quick corrective, ''or it should be.'' Her new job is a little like rescuing a well-located but foundering cultural institution on Fifth Avenue, or at least that is what Ms. Jones, who is also the president and director of the Museum of the City of New York uptown on Fifth Avenue's Museum Mile, has been telling herself. Been there, done that, still doing it.
At the City Museum, she presides over an eclectic collection of 1.5 million historic artifacts, from Alexander Hamilton's desk to Bella Abzug's hats, all housed in an elegant 1932 mansion in the final stages of a $90 million renovation. 
Before she was hired, the museum was in limbo: The collection began outgrowing its home in 1938, and a 1988 expansion plan never panned out. The storage conditions for its archive of 52,000 vintage photographs were abysmal; for that reason, other museums were averse to lending their treasures.
A move downtown to the Tweed Courthouse, a prospect dangled by the Giuliani administration, was withdrawn by the Bloomberg administration, leading the museum's longtime director, Robert R. Macdonald, to resign.
Then a potential 2003 merger with the New-York Historical Society, a sort of consolation prize, collapsed.
Nudged along by Ms. Jones, however, construction on a glass-clad pavilion commenced in 2006, and the museum rallied and raised $80 million of the cost, which has created a state-of-the-art, climate-controlled, 21st-century display space inside the ornate shell of the original landmark building.
Ms. Jones did not only balance the budget, she increased it to $16 million from $4 million, and she made a push for the digitalization of the collection, accompanied by interactive programming focused on all five boroughs. Her managerial and curatorial innovations uptown since 2003 are what inspired Kate D. Levin, the city's commissioner of cultural affairs, to ask her to venture downtown to fix the Seaport Museum and its not-so-fleet fleet. Ship rehab is new to her resume; the other operational conundrums are not.
''Susan manages in a very special way,'' Ms. Levin said. ''She gets results. She knows how to take history off the walls and make it come alive. And the Seaport space allows the M.C.N.Y. to branch out and tell a story congruent with its larger mission.''
If she succeeds in resurrecting the Seaport Museum, it will be the third time in Ms. Jones's late-blooming 17-year career as a ''museum person'' -- previously she worked in urban housing, landmark preservation, her family's New Jersey manufacturing business, and banking -- that she has taken control of a moribund institution, rendered it solvent and made it a player on the cultural map. The difference this time is that she will be running two museums simultaneously.
''I really think I can do it,'' she said.
The tidal wave of debt that sank the Seaport Museum's prior administration was not her problem. Ms. Jones wanted and received a clean slate from the Seaport Museum's landlord, the city's Economic Development Corporation. The museum had been in arrears on its rent for a decade and owed $3 million to its former chairman, Frank J. Sciame, who lent it the money last year to cover payroll and operating expenses. Mr. Sciame, who is no longer affiliated with the museum, said in an e-mail that the takeover was ''the right thing to do.'' Seth W. Pinsky, the Economic Development Corporation president, said the debt had been partly eliminated by write-downs from the museum's creditors.
Ms. Jones also received a green light from the Bloomberg administration, which sees a thriving Seaport Museum as a cultural anchor for its vision for the neighborhood.
The ships are the portion of the vision that worries her.
''Eleven things that float,'' she said, raising a hand to her forehead to smooth down the bangs of her windblown pageboy. She estimates that repairing them all might cost close to $100 million.
Without a windfall from a boat enthusiast with deep pockets, fixing the full fleet is not in the plan. Ms. Jones has already hired her first waterfront director, Jonathan Boulware, whose 20 years in maritime management include a stint as a captain for Calypso cruise lines. His initial job is to advise her which ships to let go of and which to preserve. Intuition tells her that the 1885 Wavertree ''is a keeper'' but that the German-built Peking is not. She is less certain about the rest.
But Ms. Jones is not the sort to be intimidated by the challenges.
''I was on the search committee that brought her to the M.C.N.Y.,'' said James G. Dinan, chief executive of York Capital Management, chairman of the City Museum's board and a major donor to its renovation, ''and with all due respect to the Seaport, the issues we're facing there are literally a fraction of what she walked into at the M.C.N.Y.
''It was really on life support. The turnaround at the M.C.N.Y. is testimony to her unbelievable mental willpower: she also took the Bloomberg administration, which had really kind of written us off, and slowly got them to buy into what she was doing.''
In Ms. Jones's office at the City Museum, pride of place belongs to a 1949 photograph by Stanley Kubrick of the boxer Rocky Graziano in a locker room shower, naked yet invulnerable. Presumably his resolute expression reminds Ms. Jones of herself.
She is not afraid to do battle: When she took over at the City Museum, she let go of the ''old guard'' among the staff and retained very few, notably the chief curator, Sarah Henry, who was hired in 2001 in tandem with the planned move to Tweed. Ms. Henry said it was ''particularly important that under Susan's leadership the museum's exhibitions, like 'Robert Moses and the Modern City: Remaking the Metropolis' and 'America's Mayor: John V. Lindsay and the Reinvention of New York,' have helped to reframe civic dialogue in the city.''
Indeed, on Ms. Jones's watch, the museum, once known as the place with a nice collection of antique toy fire trucks, theater costumes and silverware, has become a place for serious intellectual debate.
Nicolai Ouroussoff, then the architecture critic at The New York Times, called the Moses show ''a sweeping, scholarly exhibition that breathes fresh air into one of the most tired, overworked and misunderstood subjects in the city's history.''
''Ten years ago that museum's future was up for grabs,'' said Mike Wallace, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian. ''It was a tired affair. But Susan came along and made it a gallery for social activism and urban dialogue: it's a transformed operation, a must-stop, must-see.''
Ms. Jones's husband, Richard K. Eaton, is a federal judge in the United States International Trade Court and a former chief of staff to Senator Daniel P. Moynihan; they have two daughters, both in their 20s. When Ms. Jones was in her 30s, she went back to graduate school and earned an M.B.A. from Columbia University. ''It made a new woman of me,'' she said of business school, which erased her fears of trying to build a career with just a bachelor's degree in English from Vassar. She worked as a Citibank loan officer and as the executive director of New York Landmarks Conservancy from 1990 to 1993. When her husband's law career took them to Washington, she spent a decade reasserting the stature of the National Building Museum, a beautiful edifice suffering from an identity crisis.
The question will be whether she can also do that for the Seaport Museum, which has suffered from a dwindling membership, a failure to update its programming and educational programs and, according to Ms. Jones, fiscal mismanagement. ''They just plain spent too much money,'' she said.
Her conditions for taking on the Seaport Museum, shuttered since February, included an infusion of nearly $3 million in grants from city agencies, the autonomy to reconfigure the staff and replace the board, and full immunity from the inertia and debts of the past.
''The urgency about the decision to come here was that this museum was going under,'' she said, gesturing toward 12 Fulton Street, where the museum has headquarters. ''What was lacking is focus, and that's what I can fix as a manager. It is inhumane to run a failed financial ship. It jeopardizes the collections.''
Ms. Jones has trimmed the Seaport Museum staff to 15, and its brand-new board has just seven members. Several members of her uptown staff are, as she is, doing double museum duty.
Ms. Jones expects the Seaport Museum to be back in business by January, and its fleet functional by April. If this takeover succeeds, the two museums may merge. If, after 14 to 18 months, she is unable to produce a turnaround, she and her team have the option of withdrawing their stewardship. The option obviously pains her.
''I've been vacillating between these highs of total exhilaration at the opportunity and abject terror and despair,'' she said. ''I am quite aware that it can't take 20 years. Hey, we all know I'm 64. But it concerns me that folks are forging ahead determining the future of the city without knowing about its past. We think we have a role here.''

HEADLINE: Comments by N.B.A.'s Players Are Gleeful, but How Will Fans React?

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
In an age when technology has all but erased anonymity, Twitter has turned into the microphone of choice for those who want a voice. Within hours of the handshake agreement early Saturday that all but ended the nearly five-month N.B.A. lockout, players started posting messages to express their relief and happiness.
''Just wanna say Thank You to the fans for your patience and understanding thru all this,'' Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony (@carmeloanthony) wrote. ''Glad to give you the game of basketball back.'' 
Kevin Durant (@KDTrey5) of the Oklahoma City Thunder appeared ready to celebrate by making his feelings permanent: ''Mannnn im bouta to get a ratchet tattoo on my ribs that say 'survived the nba lockout in 2011.' ''
About 430 players must still ratify the deal, which calls for an even split of the league's $4 billion in annual revenue between the players and the owners and an array of changes aimed at shrinking the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest teams. Before a vote, though, both sides must dispose of pending lawsuits, and the players must reconstitute their union, steps that are likely to happen in the next few days.
The players will also review the agreement, something Jason Richardson (@jrich23), an Orlando Magic guard, warned his colleagues to take seriously. ''Glad lockout is almost over, but I hope each player read the fine print and make the right decision with their mind and not their heart,'' he wrote.
Still, dozens of players' comments amounted to an early straw poll, and a proxy for the likelihood of their ratifying the agreement. Although they represent a subset of opinions, the comments suggest that the owners need not worry much that the players will reject the deal.
Anthony Tolliver (@ATolliver44), a Minnesota Timberwolves forward, seemed to speak for many players when he wrote, ''this is not a GREAT deal but good enough to play.'' Shane Battier (@ShaneBattier), a Memphis Grizzlies forward, wrote that he was ''Happy to start talking hoops instead of legal terms.''
The players' use of Twitter could turn out to be a double-edged sword, one that may be hard to put back in its sheath. On one hand, it gives the players, rookies and veterans alike, a chance to be heard; they no longer have to rely on their negotiating leaders to speak for them. On the other hand, the cacophony of voices may drown out those of the players' chosen representatives.
''The players are now stampeding out the door to play, undercutting the ability of the union leaders,'' said James Katz, the director of the Center for Mobile Communication Studies at Rutgers University. Those leaders ''lose their credibility and authority when representing their views to the owners,'' he added.
Notably, most players, at least on Twitter, did not express their feelings about the terms of the deal, only their excitement at going back to work, a suggestion that they would approve the proposed agreement.
LeBron James (@KingJames) of the Miami Heat wrote, ''I feel like my kids on X-mas day!''
Jeff Green (@unclejeffgreen), a Boston Celtics forward, told his followers he ''just had a big bowl of Fruit Loops to celebrate this lock-out ending.'' Deron Williams (@DeronWilliams), the Nets guard who has played in Turkey during the lockout, appeared ready to head for the airport. ''Guess ill be going home soon #LockoutOver!'' he wrote. ''My time in Istanbul w/ Besiktas was amazing thanks for everything!''
Young players appeared particularly eager. Travis Leslie (@FlightLeslie23), a Los Angeles Clippers rookie, wrote, ''Crying tears of joy!'' Vernon Macklin (@vernon--macklin), a Detroit Pistons rookie, wrote, ''So uhhh.... when do I get to start my new job?'' Landry Fields (@landryfields), a second-year Knicks guard, wrote, ''On a brighter note, America's unemployment rate just lowered.''
Joking aside, the owners' and players' struggle to divide $4 billion grated on many fans trying to keep jobs and pay bills. Indeed, while the players prepare to suit up, one unresolved question is how fans will react, particularly those who swore off the N.B.A. during the lockout.
Because the schedule is being reformulated, it is too early to gauge how much fans will be willing to spend for seats, ticket brokers say. But if there was a silver lining to the lockout, it was that it eliminated the first two months of the season, when basketball has a hard time competing with college and professional football.
As Jason Berger, a managing partner at AllShows.com, a large ticket reseller, said, ''They are heading into a time where they don't have a lot of competition, which is good for them.''

HEADLINE: Transgendered And Homeless, Youth Struggles To Build a Life

BYLINE: By MERIBAH KNIGHT. 
mknight@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Dressed in black baggy jeans, a gray tank top and a Harley Davidson cap skewed backward, Juan Gallaher stood under a cool late-fall drizzle devouring a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from the Night Ministry's homeless-youth-outreach van at Belmont Avenue and Halsted Street.
It was 8:30 p.m., and Mr. Gallaher was getting his first meal of the day. But he has gone so long and so often without food that hunger is now a faint feeling, he said, though he knows he needs to eat.
Three weeks earlier, he had turned 21. While that is a happy milestone for most young people, for Mr. Gallaher -- a ward of the state since 2006 -- it meant he was no longer eligible for services from the Illinois child welfare system. As a result, he lost his apartment and his subsidies. 
''I've learned in my life that nothing is stable,'' Mr. Gallaher said. So he focuses on the fundamentals: getting a free dinner and finding a place to sleep -- maybe under a bridge, in an abandoned house or crowded with other homeless youths on the floor of a friend's small apartment.
With a state unemployment rate of 10.1 percent, combined with a lack of affordable housing and shelter beds, an increase in homeless young people in Chicago is putting stress on an overburdened social-support system that is facing deep cuts in budgets and programs.
Advocates estimate that Chicago has up to 3,000 homeless youths in need of shelter on any given night. But there are just 209 youth shelter beds available citywide -- only 5 percent of the approximately 4,000 in the city's shelters. And with local youth shelters and drop-in centers turning away more young people than ever, providers said, young homeless people are left to navigate for themselves in a system created to meet the needs of adults.
Homeless youths are in need of nurturing, they are easy targets for crime and abuse, and some are prone to commit crimes. This makes the task of helping them costly and complex. Beyond basic housing, there is a need for services that can help them obtain an education and job skills that could help lead them toward society's mainstream.
Mr. Gallaher also is a transgender person, and a former ward of the state -- both of which, studies show, make him far more likely to experience homelessness.
Experts say that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people make up a disproportionate number of the homeless youth; they represent as much as 40 percent of the national homeless population.
Many youths with gender-identity issues have been kicked out of their homes or have run away. In Chicago, most flock to Boystown, the magnet for young gay men and lesbians along Halsted Street on the North Side, looking for ad hoc family structures born of the street -- street moms, street dads, nieces, nephews, brothers and sisters. Some even call themselves twins.
A History of Abuse
Mr. Gallaher, the second oldest of 11 children, likes to say he came from ''a hole under a rock in the middle of nowhere.'' Birth records show he was born in Duplin County, N.C., on Oct. 2, 1990, Paige Francis Gallaher.
He said he grew up homeless, sleeping in Dumpsters and trees with his older brother and his drug-addicted mother. His tales of abuse are harrowing: rape, beatings, forced prostitution. For years, Mr. Gallaher struggled with his gender identity. Though he was born female, he felt more comfortable wearing boys' clothes, lifting weights and passing for male.
To Mr. Gallaher, a male identity was intrinsic. To his family it was ''an abomination of nature,'' he recalls his mother saying. Eventually they shut him out, and now he has no contact with his siblings or his mother.
Mr. Gallaher was sent to live with a relative in Illinois, but more abuse and more running away followed, he said. Eventually, records show, the state took custody and placed him in a group home. He bounced around living programs and, still a woman at age 19, gave birth to a daughter.
In 2010, under the care of the Howard Brown Health Center in Lakeview, Mr. Gallaher began taking hormone injections to make the transition from female to male. Every month he must somehow save the $35 it costs to continue taking them. On Nov. 23, 2010, he officially changed his name from Paige to Juan, records show. In February Mr. Gallaher gave up his daughter for adoption after child services was called when he left her in the care of a friend while he was in the hospital. Mr. Gallaher chose an open adoption, not wanting to place her in the child welfare system where he spent much of his youth.
As part of an independent living program, Mr. Gallaher lived in an apartment in Melrose Park. He loved the western suburb so much he named it Hope City. But after aging out of the child welfare system in October he lost the apartment -- and was on the streets again.
Nearly 40 percent of youths who reach 21 and lose access to foster care experience some form of homelessness, according to a 2010 Midwest study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago. Additionally, 2009 data show Illinois with more foster youths aging out than in previous years, up 1.2 percent, while nationally it has gone down by nearly half of 1 percent.
''As soon as you're 21, all the support is gone,'' said Amy Dworsky, a senior researcher at Chapin Hall. ''We live in a place where there is a big shortage of affordable housing, and we know these young people are not earning significant amounts of money. Their options are limited.''
Chicago, with its big city allure and a continuum of services, attracts runaway and homeless youths. Yet as the population grows, state and federal cuts are hacking away at budgets for outreach organizations.
A survey released Monday by the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless reported that 55 percent of Illinois agencies administering homeless prevention grants said they would run out of money by Dec. 31. Last year, shelter programs in Illinois served 40,542 people, yet people were turned away 45,673 times because of insufficient resources, the survey said.
In the 2012 state budget, Gov. Pat Quinn approved $4.7 million in cuts, a 52 percent reduction of state outlays for shelters, emergency housing and transportation. Homeless advocates hope to persuade lawmakers to reverse the cuts Tuesday, the final day of this year's legislative session.
''We want homeless youth to be heard. Too often they're invisible,'' said Anne Holcomb, a coordinator at the Night Ministry's Open Door Shelter. ''They're even invisible when it comes to funding.''
Making It Work
For youths like Mr. Gallaher, the erosion of financing means he has less contact with social workers and spends more time wandering the streets, crashing on couches and fending for himself. He believes he is missing information about jobs, classes or other opportunities that might help him get on his feet.
Recently, sitting on a mattress on the floor at a friend's apartment in West Pullman on the South Side, an area he and friends refer to as Ragtown, Mr. Gallaher recited his current motto: ''This isn't the life I want, but it's the life I've got, and I can't let the life I've got kill me before I get the life I want.''
Mr. Gallaher prides himself on his street savvy. The most prized of his few possessions -- which include five decks of magic cards, a utility knife, a Dell computer and an MP3 player -- is a fireproof briefcase containing labeled folders filled with resource pamphlets on transportation, housing, mental health, Internet cafes, jobs and food.
For Boystown's homeless youth, Mr. Gallaher is a connector of sorts, a liaison between the services offered and the young people who need them. ''If you need help,'' he said, ''you come to me. I'll tell you where to go to get what you need.''
But that is getting harder, and Mr. Gallaher can make fewer referrals these days. ''With all the budget cuts, there is not as much programming now,'' Mr. Gallaher said. ''It's a lot different.''
On Nov. 16, Mr. Gallaher scraped together enough money to take out his partner -- who goes by the name Genesis and like many homeless youths declines to give his full name -- to celebrate his 20th birthday at Castle Buffet at Belmont and Kimball. Inside, Genesis, Mr. Gallaher and his two ''nephews'' declared an eating contest. They piled plates high with fried shrimp, pizza, stir-fry and sweet buns, and ate French fries with chopsticks. Laughing, they set napkins on fire so Genesis could blow them out to make a wish.
They talked about going to Hope City after dinner, but wound up in Boystown, wandering along Halsted Street and goofing off. Passers-by glared. Some crossed the street.
But it was too cold to walk all night, and it was too late to get into a nearby shelter. They would head back to the West Pullman apartment.
Hope City would have to wait.
''Tomorrow,'' said Mr. Gallaher as he walked toward the train, his MP3 player piping Beethoven's ''Moonlight Sonata'' into his earphones. ''Tomorrow we'll go to Hope City.''

HEADLINE: The Blog: Trucks Still Haul Dollars to Detroit

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
In 2008 and 2009, as the American automotive industry foundered, critics often cited Detroit's fixation with light trucks and S.U.V.'s, which had fallen out of favor as gas prices rose, for the industry's agita. A new study authored by Max Warburton of Bernstein Research, a market trends and analysis firm, suggests that automakers' fondness for big iron was, and continues to be, driven by the outsize profit margins generated by the machines. 
Detroit's light-truck models - namely the Ford F-Series, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups from General Motors and Chrysler's Ram - rank first through third among Mr. Warburton's list of the top 12 most profitable vehicles for their makers in the United States.
The list takes into account sales going back to 1990, so the influence of current economic and environmental pressures is somewhat muted. Not so muted were the pre-tax profits generated by the top three trucks since 1990: $108 billion, according to the report.
The only other Big Three product on the list is the Jeep Grand Cherokee, but the Jeep was not the most profitable S.U.V. in the rankings. That honor goes to the Lexus RX, which edged out the Grand Cherokee for No. 8 on the list.
Mr. Warburton notes that a combination of high price, tenure in the marketplace and high volume are the keys to wide profit margins. Light trucks score high in all three of those categories, particularly volume, but they also return substantial profits because unlike passenger cars, they are not so dependent on frequent technology upgrades; suspension parts and conventional rear-drive third members often carry over from one generation to the next.
Other highly profitable vehicles on Mr. Warburton's list include two best-selling midsize Japanese sedans, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. Mr. Warburton notes that their high production volume compensates for a relatively modest price. Smaller sedans, coupes and hatches, given their even lighter price tags and lower volumes, don't return enough profit to rank among the top moneymakers.
Luxury vehicles produced in moderate volumes, meanwhile, leverage their tenure in the marketplace to ensure their makers a consistent profit stream. In particular, products from Germany, including BMW 3 and 5 Series, the Mercedes E- and S-Class, and the Porsche 911 have been boons to bottom lines. Given its high price and long marketplace tenure, the S-Class ranks as the most profitable of all passenger cars.
Mr. Warburton's complete list follows:
1. Ford F-Series 2. General Motors pickups 3. Chrysler Ram 4. Mercedes S-Class 5. BMW 5 Series 6. BMW 3 Series 7. Mercedes E-Class 8. Lexus RX 9. Jeep Grand Cherokee 10. Honda Accord 11. Porsche 911 12. Toyota Camry
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

ARGENTINA'S SOCCER VIOLENCE
More than a decade after England finally tamed the roving bands of hooligans that long ravaged soccer stadiums in Britain, fan-related violence continues to stain the sport in Argentina. The unrest in part reflects an increasingly violent Argentine society, where street crime is on the rise. But much of the violence can be traced to hostilities between rival factions of hooligan fan groups. Page 1

SCARBOROUGH, Me.
LINED up in a gun rack beneath mounted deer heads is a Bushmaster Carbon 15, a matte-black semiautomatic rifle that looks as if it belongs to a SWAT team. On another rack rests a Teflon-coated Prairie Panther from DPMS Firearms, a supplier to the United States Border Patrol and security agencies in Iraq. On a third is a Remington 750 Woodsmaster, a popular hunting rifle.
The variety of rifles and shotguns on sale here at Cabela's, the national sporting goods chain, is a testament to America's enduring gun culture. But, to a surprising degree, it is also a testament to something else: Wall Street deal-making.
In recent years, many top-selling brands -- including the 195-year-old Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS, leading makers of military-style semiautomatics -- have quietly passed into the hands of a single private company. It is called the Freedom Group -- and it is the most powerful and mysterious force in the American commercial gun industry today. 
Never heard of it?
You're not alone. Even within gun circles, the Freedom Group is something of an enigma. Its rise has been so swift that it has become the subject of wild speculation and grassy-knoll conspiracy theories. In the realm of consumer rifles and shotguns -- long guns, in the trade -- it is unrivaled in its size and reach. By its own count, the Freedom Group sold 1.2 million long guns and 2.6 billion rounds of ammunition in the 12 months ended March 2010, the most recent year for which figures are publicly available.
Behind this giant is Cerberus Capital Management, the private investment company that first came to widespread attention when it acquired Chrysler in 2007. (Chrysler later had to be rescued by taxpayers). With far less fanfare, Cerberus, through the Freedom Group, has been buying big names in guns and ammo.
From its headquarters on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, Cerberus has assembled a remarkable arsenal. It began with Bushmaster, which until recently was based here in Maine. Unlike military counterparts like automatic M-16's, rifles like those from Bushmaster don't spray bullets with one trigger pull. But, with gas-powered mechanisms, semiautomatics can fire rapid follow-up shots as fast as the trigger can be squeezed. They are often called ''black guns'' because of their color. The police tied a Bushmaster XM15 rifle to shootings in the Washington sniper case in 2002.
After Bushmaster, the Freedom Group moved in on Remington, which traces its history to the days of flintlocks and today is supplying M24 sniper rifles to the government of Afghanistan and making handguns for the first time in decades. The group has also acquired Marlin Firearms, which turned out a special model for Annie Oakley, as well as Dakota Arms, a maker of high-end big-game rifles. It has bought DPMS Firearms, another maker of semiautomatic, military-style rifles, as well as manufacturers of ammunition and tactical clothing.
''We believe our scale and product breadth are unmatched within the industry,'' the Freedom Group said in a filing last year with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Here at Cabela's, Mark Eliason, the vice president for sales and marketing at Windham Weaponry, a new competitor of Bushmaster that was established by Bushmaster's founder, surveys the racks. He estimates that roughly 20 percent of the long guns for sale here are made by Freedom Group companies. In the aisles, he examines shelf upon shelf of ammunition. About a third of it comes from the Freedom Group, he says.
''That's a very large presence,'' Mr. Eliason says.
So large, in fact, that rumors about the Freedom Group -- what it is, and who is behind it -- have been circulating in the blogosphere. Some gun enthusiasts have claimed that the power behind the company is actually George Soros, the hedge-fund billionaire and liberal activist. Mr. Soros, these people have warned, is buying American gun companies so he can dismantle the industry, Second Amendment be damned.
The chatter grew so loud that the National Rifle Association issued a statement in October denying the rumors.
''N.R.A. has had contact with officials from Cerberus and Freedom Group for some time,'' the N.R.A. assured its members. ''The owners and investors involved are strong supporters of the Second Amendment and are avid hunters and shooters.''
Mr. Soros isn't behind the Freedom Group, but, ultimately, another financier is: Stephen A. Feinberg, the chief executive of Cerberus.
CERBERUS is part of one of the signature Wall Street businesses of the past decade: private equity. Buyout kings like Mr. Feinberg, 51, try to acquire undervalued companies, often with borrowed money, fix them up and either take them public or sell at a profit to someone else.
Before the financial crisis of 2008, scores of well-known American companies, from Chrysler down, passed into the hands of private-equity firms. For the financiers, the rewards were often enormous. But some companies that they acquired later ran into trouble, in part because they were burdened with debt from the takeovers.
Mr. Feinberg, a Princeton graduate who began his Wall Street career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk bond powerhouse of Michael R. Milken fame, got into private equity in 1992. That year, he and William L. Richter founded Cerberus, which takes its name from the three-headed dog in Greek mythology that guards the gates of Hades.
Today, Mr. Feinberg presides over a private empire that rivals some of the mightiest public companies in the land. Cerberus manages more than $20 billion in capital. Together, the companies it owns generate annual revenue of about $40 billion -- more than either Amazon or Coca-Cola last year.
Why Cerberus went after gun companies isn't clear. Many private investment firms shy away from such industries to avoid scaring off big investors like pension funds.
Yet, in many ways, the move is classic Cerberus. Mr. Feinberg has a history of investing in companies that other people may not want, but that Cerberus believes it can turn around. When Cerberus embarked on its acquisition spree in guns, it essentially had the field to itself.
''There's much less competition for buying these companies,'' says Steven N. Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a private equity expert. ''They must have decided there is an opportunity to make money by investing in the firearms industry and trying to build a big company.''
Whatever the reason, Cerberus, through the Freedom Group, is now a major player.
It may come as a surprise to many people, given the prominence of guns in American culture, the national conversation and politics, but the commercial firearms market in the United States is actually relatively small. Sales of guns and ammunition total about $4 billion annually, according to estimates from the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group.
True, the N.R.A. estimates that about 70 million to 80 million Americans collectively own 300 million firearms. But how many of those people buy new guns regularly? For companies like the Freedom Group, the challenge is to expand the market. These days, more women are involved in target shooting, according to participation reports from the National Sporting Goods Association. But, analysts say, many young men who in the past might have taken up game hunting are now more interested in other pursuits like online gaming.
So, to keep growing, the Freedom Group has expanded its sales staff in the United States and increased its business internationally. It has sold weapons to the governments of Afghanistan, Thailand, Mexico and Malaysia, among others, and obtained new business from the United States Army, including a contract worth up to $28.2 million, to upgrade the M24 sniper weapon system.
Cerberus brings some connections to the table. The longtime chairman of its global investments group is Dan Quayle, the former vice president. The Freedom Group, meantime, has added two retired generals to its board. One is George A. Joulwan, who retired from the Army after serving as Supreme Allied Commander of Europe. The other is Michael W. Hagee, formerly commandant of the Marine Corps.
Jessica Kallam, a spokeswoman at the Freedom Group, said executives there declined to comment for this article. Timothy Price, a managing director of Cerberus, also declined to comment.
THE old Bushmaster factory in Windham, Me., doesn't look like much. With a facade of brick and gray aluminum siding, it squats in an unassuming office park on the Roosevelt Trail.
But Cerberus representatives who arrived here in 2005 clearly saw potential. Inside, several dozen gunsmiths, working by hand, were fitting together 6,000 to 7,000 weapons a month. At the time, Bushmaster was thriving, though it had been stung by bad publicity stemming from the Beltway sniper shootings. (In a 2004 settlement with victims of the shootings and their families, Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, the store where the gun was acquired, agreed to pay $2 million, and Bushmaster agreed to pay $568,000, but they did not admit liability.)
Richard Dyke, then the principal owner and chairman of Bushmaster, welcomed the visitors from New York. A blunt-spoken Korean War veteran and Republican fund-raiser, he had made a fortune himself by buying companies in trouble, including one that made poker chips. In 1976, he bought a bankrupt gun maker in Bangor, Me., for $241,000, moved it to Windham and later changed its name to Bushmaster.
The company that Mr. Dyke bought had patents on semiautomatic weapons designed for the military and police. But he was drawn to the nascent market in military-style firearms for civilians. He saw as his customers precision target shooters, including current and former military personnel, police officers and, well, military wannabes, he says.
A Bushmaster Carbon 15 .223 semiautomatic is about three feet long. But, weighing in at just under six pounds, it is surprisingly easy to maneuver, even for a novice. It doesn't have to be recocked after it's fired: you just squeeze the trigger over and over.
''At 25 meters, if you are a decent shot,'' Mr. Dyke says, ''you can put it into a bull's-eye that is the size of a quarter.''
The Bushmaster brand began to grow in the 1980s after the company started supplying its semiautomatics to police departments. It won a much larger consumer following in the 1990s, after it landed several small military contracts.
Bushmaster was among the first to sell ordinary people on weapons that look and feel like the ones carried by soldiers. Today many gun makers have embraced military-style weapons, a major but controversial source of growth for the commercial gun market, says Tom Diaz, a senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center, a research group that backs gun control.
''It's clear that the militarized stuff is the stuff that sells and is defining the industry,'' Mr. Diaz says.
Mr. Dyke says he's not sure why Bushmaster caught the eye of Cerberus. Whatever the case, when Cerberus came calling, Mr. Dyke, then past 70, was ready to sell. At the time, Bushmaster had $85 million in annual sales and about several million dollars in debt, he says. In April 2006, he sold the company to Cerberus for about $76 million, he says, and Cerberus rented the Bushmaster plant here for five years.
The next year, Cerberus formed the Freedom Group.
Now Bushmaster is gone from Maine. Earlier this year, Mr. Dyke says, the Freedom Group notified him it was closing Bushmaster's operation in the state and moving it to a bigger plant owned by Remington, a typical consolidation play for a private investment firm looking to cut costs and increase efficiency. Remington, for its part, announced earlier this year that it was expanding its manufacturing capacity and hiring new employees to make Bushmasters.
Several months ago, Mr. Dyke started a new company, Windham Weaponry, at the old Bushmaster site and has rehired most of his former employees. But he's not planning to go head-to-head with the Freedom Group.
''It's the big gorilla in the room,'' he says, adding: ''We don't have to do $100 million. We'd have hopes of doing $20 million.''
REMINGTON has been producing guns since 1816, when, according to lore, a young man named Eliphalet Remington made a flintlock rifle in his father's forge in Ilion Gulch, in upstate New York. By the 1870s, the brand was so popular that the company diversified into typewriters.
In 2007, the Freedom Group swooped in and bought Remington for $370 million, including $252 million in assumed debt. In one stroke, the Freedom Group gained one of the most famous names in American firearms, the largest domestic maker of shotguns and rifles and a major manufacturer of ammunition.
''That caused a lot of stir in the industry,'' says Dean J. Lockwood, a weapons systems analyst at Forecast International, a market research firm.
Next, the Freedom Group in rapid succession went after other firearms companies: DPMS; Marlin Firearms, a classic maker that came with two niche shotgun brands, Harrington & Richardson and L. C. Smith; and Dakota Arms. The Freedom Group also bought S&K industries, which supplies wood and laminate for gun stocks, as well as the Advanced Armament Corporation, which makes silencers. It acquired Barnes Bullets, which makes copper-jacketed bullets popular with precision shooters and police departments.
The more the company diversifies its portfolio, analysts say, the more it has to offer to firearms distributors and leading retailers like Wal-Mart and Cabela's.
''You can see Freedom Group constantly expanding its manufacturing base,'' Mr. Lockwood says. ''You don't want to be a one-trick pony. They are trying to get as far into the market as they can.'' What is left? The Freedom Group does not own the Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation or Sturm, Ruger, both publicly traded. Nor does it own the Colt's Manufacturing, which is privately owned.
Cerberus also does not own Winchester Repeating Arms or Browning, both part of the Herstal Group of Belgium.
Still, the Freedom Group has ingested so many well-known brands so quickly that some gun owners are uneasy about what it might do next. Two years ago, a Cerberus managing director, George Kollitides, ran for the board of the N.R.A. Despite an endorsement from Remington, and the fact that he was a director of the Freedom Group and Remington, he lost. His campaign didn't sit well with some gun bloggers, who viewed him as an industry interloper.
Andrew Arulanandam, the N.R.A.'s director for public affairs, declined to speculate about why Mr. Kollitides lost. ''It's a great question to ask our four million members,'' he said.
THE challenges for gun makers in America go far beyond those faced by many other companies. As in many industries, sales tend to rise and fall with the economy. But firearms makers must also grapple with the vicissitudes of politics and public opinion.
Many Americans are solidly behind the right to own guns. In a Gallup poll conducted in October, only 43 percent of respondents said they supported stricter gun laws -- an all-time low since the company first asked the question in 1990. And 47 percent reported that there was a gun in their home or on their property, the highest level of self-reported gun ownership since 1993, according to the poll, which canvassed about 1,000 adults in early October.
Earlier this month, the House of Representatives passed a ''right to carry'' bill that would require states to recognize one another's permits to carry concealed weapons. If the bill passes the Senate, people in states with weaker concealed-weapon regulations would be able to carry concealed handguns into states like California, which requires extensive background checks.
The development would be good news for handgun makers like Colt and Smith & Wesson, but wouldn't be much help to the Freedom Group, which focuses on long guns.
That, however, may be changing. Not long ago, Remington introduced the Remington 1911 R1, its first pistol in decades. Industry analysts speculate that the Freedom Group might next go shopping for a handgun maker to expand its presence in that segment of the market.
''At the right price,'' says Jim Barrett, an analyst at CL King who covers firearms companies, ''it would be logical for them to be interested in one of the premier handgun manufacturers.''
But, in an industry with few independent players left, the big question is this: What is Freedom Group's long-term strategy? Because the company is private, outsiders can only speculate.
The Freedom Group had planned to go public, but backed away earlier this year when the financial markets turned turbulent. As of the end of September, the company had nearly half a billion dollars in debt, according to a third-quarter earnings report available on the Freedom Group's Web site. That includes about $225 million in debt that the company raised last year to pay itself a special dividend used to buy back preferred stock from Cerberus, according to a company prospectus filed with the S.E.C.
Some analysts say tactical rifles have peaked, that the market has topped out, and that small, concealable handguns are the way forward for the near future. And yet, after a tough 2010, gun sales at the Freedom Group were up 5.6 percent during the first nine months of this year, although the company reported a net loss of $6.3 million for the same time period, according to the company's most recent earnings report.
Meantime, the Freedom Group, despite its place atop the industry, appears to be operating without an official chief executive of its own. Its most recent C.E.O., Theodore H. Torbeck, resigned in September 2010 and no replacement has been named. For the moment, a temporary office of the chief executive, led by Robert L. Nardelli, the Cerberus executive who oversaw Chrysler, is helping to lead the company
''It's a sensible strategy to roll up things,'' says Gautam Khanna, an aerospace and military industry analyst at Cowen & Company. The issue is whether the Freedom Group, and Cerberus, can persuade more Americans to buy more guns.
''That,'' Mr. Khanna says, ''is an open question.''

Re ''Whatever Happened to Discipline and Hard Work?'' (Economic View, Nov. 13):
Yes, as Tyler Cowen says in the column, it's true that our American culture has always had high regard for those able to rise from poverty to riches. But throughout our history, we've also been guided by a social contract that holds that no one in this country makes it alone, and that the needs of those who have helped the wealthiest to get where they are must also be met. 
I'm not talking about handouts. I'm talking about fairly compensating those who have worked hard and long. That has certainly not been the case, especially in recent years when the wealthiest have received an unconscionably huge portion of the benefits.
Alvin Zubasky
Delray Beach, Fla., Nov. 14
To the Editor:
Many Americans are working longer hours for stagnating or declining wages and fewer benefits -- and are facing the ugly prospect of financial insecurity in retirement. The problem is not the American worker; the problem is that Wall Street itself has no discipline and is hardly working for the average American.
The ''entitlement culture'' belongs not to lower-income Americans, but to the reckless Wall Street super-rich who assume that they are entitled to massive wealth for manipulating markets and creating bogus financial instruments.
The only way to bring Wall Street's peculiar brand of crony capitalism to heel is to tax its transactions and regulate its behavior. If Congress has the will to do that, it will be through the discipline and hard work of millions of Americans who demand it.
Christopher J. Curtis

To the Editor:
The vision described in the column is not the Founding Fathers' vision. Theirs was more complete: While discipline and hard work are important, they are less important than equality (of opportunity), fraternity (''a more perfect Union'') and liberty (basic human rights).
The Founding Fathers stressed these points in the Constitution -- they did not stress discipline and hard work.
Whoever distorts ''pursuit of happiness'' into ''pursuit of wealth'' perpetrates the Animal Farm injustice (''all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others'') on our nation.
Of course, the Founding Fathers also said ''We the People.'' They did not say ''We the corporate persons.'' Charles Kick

To the Editor:
No matter how disciplined and hard-working any of the ''99 percent'' are, the cost of education is a huge deterrent to achievement.
The efforts of some of the 1 percent to defund education at all levels leads to an impossibly big debt burden.
Or, it discourages altogether attempts to learn what's needed to develop and maintain the technological society on which we all depend (especially the 1 percent). Margaret Eiszner

HEADLINE: 3 Men Forged 2 Decades Of Labor Peace

BYLINE: By JON PESSAH. 
Jon Pessah is writing a book with Claire Smith for Little, Brown & Co. on the history of the last 20 years of baseball.

 BODY:
Sometime early in Bud Selig's celebration of baseball's new collective bargaining agreement on Wednesday, he wondered if the two sides had needed to go through the pain of 1994 in order to achieve the peaceful -- and very profitable -- coexistence they enjoy today. It was almost certainly meant as a rhetorical question. Selig answered with a casual ''perhaps.'' But there is nothing rhetorical about the question. And the answer to it is a most emphatic yes.
Why? 
Because it took the pain of that experience to teach Bud Selig, Donald Fehr and George Steinbrenner -- the three men most responsible for baseball as we now know it -- that they had to work together instead of continuing to pull the game apart. It was the partnership of these three men, forged in baseball's worst moment, that took the game from the turmoil of the early '90s to what will be 21 years of uninterrupted prosperity when the new five-year agreement ends in 2016.
Just how far did this partnership propel baseball? Consider these two elements in the sport's newest agreement:
One calls for the realignment of the game into two 15-team leagues, an idea first put on the table by the union more than 10 years ago. Not only did management adopt an idea developed by the players, it gave the union the credit it deserved. Gone is the acrimony that held back the game for so long. Indeed, both sides praised the other so often at Wednesday's news conference, one almost wondered if that was really Selig sitting in the middle of the dais.
Another is the change that ties revenue sharing to the luxury tax. This works two ways. One, by the end of the agreement, the 15 teams in the game's largest markets are disqualified from receiving revenue sharing funds. That encourages underperforming franchises to increase revenues -- in theory by fielding a better team -- instead of living on welfare, a position long held by the union.
Two, the money these teams once received is tossed into a pot and split among the 12 to 14 teams that annually contribute to the $400 million-plus revenue sharing pool -- but only if they're under the luxury tax threshold. This creating a double incentive for the big spenders to hold down payroll: avoiding the tax and getting a revenue sharing rebate.
With the tax threshold rising to $189 million in the last three years of the deal, even the Yankees -- whose payroll now hovers around $200 million -- may be tempted to cut spending. And that's something baseball has long desired. So the union got what it wanted and management got what it wanted -- on the same issue.
How did that happen?
For starters, Selig, whose single greatest achievement as baseball's commissioner is unifying the owners under the revenue-sharing banner, learned to stop treating Fehr, the leader of the players union, as an existential threat. Make no mistake, Selig's decision in 1994 to end one of the game's extraordinary seasons and shutter a World Series was all about driving Fehr from the game and breaking the union. For the game's new commissioner, there could be no other way.
Back then, the only means for a small-market owner to survive -- especially the one in Milwaukee, the game's smallest market -- was to socialize the game's revenues in the manner of the N.F.L. And the only way baseball's richest owners -- especially the one in the Bronx -- would agree to that sort of revenue sharing was to force a salary cap on their players. In effect, Selig promised to pay back a George Steinbrenner with the money he took from the pockets of Fehr's clients.
When Sonia Sotomayor, then a Federal District Court judge, told Selig that his strategy wouldn't fly, he was forced to change tactics. Instead of trying to crush the union, Selig hired Randy Levine, who at the time was New York City labor commissioner, to work with Fehr and devise a system they could all accept. The result wasn't perfect, but it was a start. And if it wasn't an end to the hostilities, it was a start to the kind of trust that the two sides needed to develop.
And they have.
The experience taught Fehr that to forgive and forget was not only noble, but necessary if he truly wanted the game to grow. It's doubtful that Fehr and the union staff -- including his former assistant Michael Weiner, the union's current executive director -- ever learned to respect Selig. Not after Selig, then head of the owners' labor committee, thanked the union for giving up a year of salary arbitration in 1985 by helping to shut down the free-agent market for the next three years. Not even the $280 million the owners paid for collusion could completely erase that.
But Fehr did learn how to keep his personal feelings from getting in the way of making a sensible deal. And how to finally shrug off the sharp criticism of Marvin Miller, the players union's godfather, who treated any union giveback -- from salary arbitration to random drug testing -- as an act of betrayal. Now Weiner, who spent 20 years working under Fehr, has done the same.
Steinbrenner's lesson might have been the costliest, at least in dollars and cents. Between revenue sharing and luxury-tax payments, Steinbrenner's Yankees have contributed upwards of $1.5 billion to the rest of Major League Baseball. Steinbrenner threatened to file a lawsuit against his peers when they came together on the first revenue-sharing agreement. Then he became the only owner to vote against the 2002 agreement, which took an even bigger bite out of his profits.
But rather than cut back, Steinbrenner learned how to push his people hard enough to not only survive the system, but also build one of the most valuable franchises in sports. How many sports teams have the worldwide name recognition of Apple, Google or Facebook?
Though only Selig is still active in the game, the best testament to the three men's legacy of cooperation is not what baseball's labor negotiators just did, but what they did not do. While their counterparts in football and basketball mirrored most of corporate America, using today's dismal economic conditions as an excuse to gouge their workers at the bargaining table, M.L.B. and its union quietly put together a deal that kept both sides happy.
Who would have thought that possible in 1994?

HEADLINE: Engineer's Return to China Leads to Jail and Limbo

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- After two decades of working as a successful engineer in the United States, Hu Zhicheng decided to return to China in 2004 and apply his rich experience to designing catalytic converters for the nation's booming automotive industry.
''I saw how polluted the air was here, and thought I could make a difference,'' said Mr. Hu, a naturalized American citizen who has a doctorate in engineering.
Now it seems he cannot leave.
The last three times he tried to board an airplane and return to his family in Los Angeles, Mr. Hu, 49, was turned away by Chinese border agents who claimed that he was a wanted man. 
The problem is, he cannot find out exactly who wants him and why.
Mr. Hu, an inventor trained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with 48 patents and a number of prestigious science awards to his name, was jailed for a year and a half starting in 2008 after a former business associate accused him of commercial theft. The charges were so spurious that prosecutors withdrew the case -- a rare gesture in China's top-down legal system.
But since his release 19 months ago, Mr. Hu's life has been in limbo and his family has grown increasingly frantic. He writes to powerful Communist Party officials who he imagines might control his fate. A coterie of influential friends and colleagues has been lobbying on his behalf. And this month, his daughter, a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley, began a petition campaign that has garnered more than 50,000 signatures.
Richard Buangan, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Beijing, said that American diplomats had had little success in pressing his case with Chinese officials. ''No authority has been cooperative with our request for information on the restrictions that block his departure from China,'' he said.
Mr. Hu's predicament highlights the potential perils of doing business in China, where commercial disputes can easily become criminal matters, especially when the politically well-connected use the country's malleable legal system to bludgeon rivals. Most worrisome, legal experts say, are the country's vague commercial secrets laws that state-owned enterprises -- the companies that dominate China's economy -- sometimes wield to protect information related to production, procurement, mergers and strategic planning.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that overseas Chinese are more vulnerable to such abuses than their non-Chinese compatriots. Last year, Stern Hu, a Chinese-Australian mining executive, was detained shortly after a deal between his company, Rio Tinto, and the state-owned Aluminum Corporation of China fell through. Convicted of stealing trade secrets and bribery, Mr. Hu was sentenced to 10 years in prison after a largely closed trial.
Xue Feng, a Chinese-American geologist who is serving eight years in prison on similar charges, said he was tortured during his interrogation. His supporters, including American diplomats, insist that the oil and gas industry data he sold was publicly available. In 2008, the authorities executed Wo Weihan, a Chinese biomedical researcher who had returned from Europe to start a medical supply company in Beijing. Tried in secret, Mr. Wo was accused of espionage, although the details of his crimes were never disclosed.
Even as official policies seek to lure Chinese-born inventors, academics and entrepreneurs with housing perks and financial incentives, lingering anti-Western xenophobia nurtured during the Mao years sometimes taints them as unpatriotic for having left. ''It's kind of reverse racism,'' said John Kamm, executive director of Dui Hua, an American human rights group that frequently advocates on behalf of detained foreign nationals in China. ''If you're ethnic Chinese with a foreign passport, you're really not considered a foreigner.''
Mr. Hu, whose long resume includes stints as a researcher in Japan and more than a decade working for an American designer of catalytic converters, the Engelhard Corporation, would seem to be the ideal returnee.
In 2006, when he took a job as chief scientist for Wuxi Weifu Environmental Catalysts, a company in eastern Jiangsu Province, he also brought his wife and their two American-born children, in part, he says, because he wanted them to become steeped in Chinese language and culture.
His return coincided with a surge in domestic car production and government-led efforts to reduce tailpipe emissions. The company prospered, and so did Mr. Hu, who eventually became Wuxi Weifu's president. It now provides catalytic converters for half of all Chinese-made cars.
Mr. Hu's troubles began after his company refused to buy components from the Hysci Specialty Materials Company, which is based in Tianjin and once supplied Engelhard.
According to Mr. Hu and his lawyers, Hysci would not take no for an answer. They say Hysci's well-connected chief executive, Dou Shihua, sent Tianjin public security agents to Wuxi Weifu to pressure Mr. Hu to change his mind.
The police raised allegations of stolen trade secrets but also suggested that the accusations would evaporate if the two companies did business together. Mr. Hu would not budge. ''We have a system of quality control, and even one word from me could not change that,'' he said.
In the end, the veiled threats gave way to an arrest, and Mr. Hu was put in a jail in Tianjin.
The patent infringement case that prosecutors eventually built against him cited technology that has been publicly available in the United States for decades, according to several scientists who rallied to his defense.
But even after prosecutors withdrew the case and Mr. Hu was freed, he found his return home blocked by immigration officials who claimed that he was still wanted by the Tianjin police. Each time he or his lawyer contacted the authorities there, however, they were told there were no such restrictions.
One of his lawyers, Wang Shou, said he believed that Mr. Dou, Hysci's chief executive, was continuing to use his influence to exact revenge or get a deal yet.
Reached by telephone, a sales executive at Hysci refused to comment on the case. The Tianjin Public Security Bureau hung up before answering questions about Mr. Hu.
His family does not know what else to do. Although his daughter visited last summer, Mr. Hu's wife and 16-year-old son are reluctant to come here, saying they fear they, too, could be prevented from leaving.
''I worry about my husband every hour of every day,'' his wife, Hong Li, who is also an engineer, said by telephone from Los Angeles. ''I don't want my son to grow up without a father.''
The emotional anguish suffered by Mr. Hu has been compounded by pain from a herniated disc that worsened during the 17 months he slept on the floor of his jail cell.
Earlier this month, at a chemical engineering conference on the outskirts of Beijing, he lectured about ways to reduce emissions from heavy trucks in China.
As the conference wound down and his American colleagues headed to the airport, he made a joke about escaping across the border.
''If I could only invent something that would make me invisible,'' he said.

FREE RIDE
How Digital Parasites Are Destroying the Culture Business, and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back
By Robert Levine
307 pp. Doubleday. $26.95
''No man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money,'' Samuel Johnson declared. As the Internet is destroying the business model that has historically supported high-quality journalism, movies, music and television, the conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is that Johnson was wrong. ''Information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower,'' technology activists have insisted, selectively quoting the technology thinker Stewart Brand. (In fact, Brand said in the same 1984 speech that on the other hand, ''information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable.'') According to the worldview embodied by Google and Facebook and many of the best minds in the legal academy and public-/interest community, the culture business is collapsing because the old-style media executives who run Hollywood, cable television, the record companies and newspapers have failed to adjust to the expectations of a demanding new generation of media consumers who want free movies and books and music and news wherever and whenever they're online. 
In ''Free Ride,'' a book that should change the debate about the future of culture, Robert Levine argues, in effect, that Samuel Johnson was right, and that it's the self-interested Silicon Valley technology companies and their well-financed advocates who are wrong. ''The real conflict online,'' Levine writes, ''is between the media companies that fund much of the entertainment we read, see and hear and the technology firms that want to distribute their content -- legally or otherwise.'' By delivering content they don't pay for, or selling content far below the price it cost to create, Levine says, information and entertainment distributors like YouTube and The Huffington Post become ''parasites'' on the media companies that invest substantially in journalists, musicians and actors; the distributors drive down prices in a way that sucks the economic lifeblood out of those who create and finance the best achievements of our culture. The result is a ''digital version of Wal-Mart capitalism,'' in which free-riding distributors reap all the economic benefits of the Internet by cutting prices, and culture suppliers are forced to cut costs in response. This dynamic, Levine argues, destroys the economic incentive to create the kinds of movies, television, music and journalism consumers demand, and for which they are, in fact, quite willing to pay.
Levine's story begins as a struggle over copyright. He interviews Bruce Lehman, a former Clinton official who championed the policies that led to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Lehman says the 1998 law was supposed to balance the interests of tech companies with those of artists and media companies. He now expresses regret that it has had the unintended consequence of making the fortunes of tech companies while devastating artists and media companies. The law allows distributors like YouTube to profit from pirated movies and video as long as they remove the illegal content when asked by those whose rights have been violated. As a result of this arrangement, YouTube's own employees were convinced that more than three-quarters of viewing hits in the site's early days derived from copyrighted video, according to e-mail disclosed in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Viacom. Google, which bought YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006, vigorously denies wrongdoing, but in the wake of the lawsuit, YouTube now takes voluntary steps to filter out copyright-/infringing content -- a solution that the studios, according to Levine, view as imperfect but an improvement.
Levine is not a pro-copyright ideologue: he acknowledges the many good reasons to reform copyright, including the fact that the copyrights' terms are too long and the financial penalties for infringement can be too high. But the biggest problem with copyright today, he says, is that its protections have become illusory in an age when movies and music, produced by independent artists and big studios alike, are available on pirate sites even before they're released. Because copyright laws are so difficult to enforce, media companies have little leverage when negotiating financial terms with distributors. And so, they're virtually forced to give their stuff away. That's what happened with the music industry, which, spooked by the proliferation of pirated file sharing on Napster, struck a bad deal with iTunes that allowed Apple to replace the sale of $15 albums with 99-cent songs. ''Even if they continue to grow,'' Levine writes, ''those 99-cent-song sales won't come close to making up for the corresponding decline in CD sales.'' (Apple can afford to sell content so cheaply because its low-cost music helps to promote more profitable products -- in this case, the iPod.) Even with the growth in online audiences, recorded music in the United States was worth $6.3 billion in sales in 2009, less than half its value a decade earlier.
The most successful culture businesses, Levine says, have resisted nostrums about how information yearns to be free and instead have insisted on the old-fashioned strategy of selling something for more than they paid for it. He notes that The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The New York Times charge for content, and that some have found that the increased revenue of full-price subscribers more than offsets the decline in digital readership. Similarly, the best TV shows, like ''Mad Men,'' are produced by cable channels like AMC that hold back their content from Hulu, a network-owned platform for distributing TV over the Internet.
The Hulu model has succeeded on the premise that ''if someone was going to make their product available online for nothing, it might as well be them,'' as Levine says of the networks. But now Hulu is threatened by start-ups like Boxee and giants like Google TV, which allows people to bring all the free (and paid) content of the Internet -- from YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix and other services -- to their televisions. The networks and Hulu have blocked Google TV from gaining access to their video, fearing it could cut into the billions of dollars in annual revenue brought in by cable bills. Also in response to Google TV-like services, Time Warner and Comcast are developing a plan called TV Everywhere, which would require Internet users to prove they are cable subscribers in order to watch certain online videos, and in return would give them the convenience of watching the shows they already pay for on any device they choose. The alternative to closed platforms like Hulu and TV Every/where, Levine says, is an open Internet model of free video that, by denying the networks any revenue to invest in shows like ''Mad Men,'' would instead produce the likes of the viral video ''Charlie Bit My Finger.''
In addition to diagnosing ''how digital parasites are destroying the culture business,'' Levine provides a vision, as his subtitle promises, of ''how the culture business can fight back.'' His model is Europe, which has a long history of supporting its culture business and, by taking a more combative stand against piracy, is trying to help legal distribution ventures flourish. Instead of filing mass lawsuits against individuals who upload pirated material, Euro/pean regulators have concentrated their efforts on bringing down the most flagrant violators among commercial distributors. Germany has laws forbidding the aggressive discounting of books in chain stores, which has preserved independent booksellers while making it harder for Amazon to introduce the Kindle. And France in 2009 approved a law that would deny Internet access to those who repeatedly violate copyright. Recently, France has begun to revive a business model that thrived in the 19th century: a collective or blanket license that, by adding a fee to Internet connections, would allow the convenient downloading of copyrighted music and divide the money to compensate producers and artists. Levine says the blanket license model could also apply to television and journalism, and would better align the value of content on the Internet with its price.
With this stylishly written and well-reported manifesto, Levine has become a leading voice on one side of our most hotly contested debate involving law and technology. Of course, there are strong arguments on the other side. It's not yet clear how effective more vigorous copyright enforcement -- of the kind proposed by Senator Patrick Leahy and the Obama administration's ''copyright czar,'' Victoria Espinel -- would be in deterring piracy. (Copyright skeptics say that if 40 million people refuse to obey a law, the law doesn't matter; Levine counters that about 40 million speeding tickets are issued each year, and no one says traffic laws don't matter.) And it remains to be seen how much consumers will be persuaded to pay for content as more of it goes behind pay walls. But regardless of your position in the business-of-culture wars, it's hard to resist Levine's conclusion that the status quo is much better for tech companies and distributors than for cultural creators and producers. That status quo may benefit consumers in the short term. But if it continues, Levine argues, the Internet will increasingly become an artistic wasteland dominated by amateurs -- a world where music, TV and journalism are virtually free, and where all of us get what we pay for.

HEADLINE: Slipping Backward On Swaps

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WALL STREET loves to do business in the shadows. Sunshine, after all, is bad for profits.
So it is perhaps unsurprising that players in the derivatives market want to thwart one of the worthier aims of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation: to bring transparency to the huge market for instruments known as swaps. Now some in Congress, on both sides of the aisle, are trying to block that goal, too.
Dodd-Frank focused on adding transparency to derivatives in a couple of ways. The area now under fire involves its directive that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission create rules to ''promote pre-trade price transparency in the swaps market.'' 
The idea is that customers should get a clear picture of prices. Right now, many swaps are traded one-on-one, over the telephone. The price is usually whatever the dealer says it is.
When markets are opaque, the risks grow that problematic positions, like those that felled the American International Group in 2008, might once again create financial turmoil and spread through the system. Dodd-Frank sensibly asked that market participants provide trade and position details to regulators so this arena could be monitored better.
That mission has pretty much been accomplished. But a lack of transparency in the market as it relates to swaps customers hasn't been addressed. And it is here that many on Wall Street, as well as some in Congress, are pushing back.
Opacity hurts customers because they can't see a wide array of prices. But dealers can -- so they have an edge that plumps up their profits. One estimate from the Swaps and Derivatives Market Association puts transaction costs in the swap markets at $50 billion annually. These costs would decline by $15 billion a year, the group recently estimated, if pricing were transparent.
The C.F.T.C. is trying to get there. Dodd-Frank requires it to oversee so-called swap execution facilities that will trade or process derivatives transactions. Late last year, in the interest of price transparency, the commission proposed that entities applying to be S.E.F.'s must agree to provide market participants with the ability to post prices on ''a centralized electronic screen'' that is widely accessible. One-to-one dealings by phone would no longer be allowed.
Those on Wall Street who favor the status quo are upset, and have found some sympathy in Washington.
Representative Scott Garrett , a New Jersey Republican, has teamed up with Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat, to introduce the Swap Execution Facility Clarification Act. It would bar the Securities and Exchange Commission and the C.F.T.C. from requiring swap execution facilities to have a minimum number of participants or mandating displays of prices. Both mechanisms promote transparency.
Mr. Garrett said the bill directed regulators ''to provide market participants with the flexibility'' they need to obtain price discovery. This means maintaining the old system that can keep prices in the shadows.
On Nov. 15, a House subcommittee approved the bill by a voice vote.
Because Mr. Garrett opposed Dodd-Frank, his efforts to stop the proposed rule are not surprising. But Ms. Maloney supported Dodd-Frank, so I wondered why she had lent her name to the bill.
In an interview last Wednesday, Ms. Maloney said she had heard concerns about the C.F.T.C. rule from financial firms in her district. ''I just felt like that Congress intended multiple competing trade execution platforms and that included voice,'' she said. ''If you say you can't have any voice, aren't you limiting the modes of trade execution?'' She also said she was concerned about job losses on Wall Street.
Testifying in the House on Oct. 14 as a representative of the Wholesale Market Brokers Association was Shawn Bernardo, a senior managing director at Tullett Prebon, an institutional brokerage firm. Mr. Bernardo articulated the argument against screen-based trading that would show multiple bids and offers to swaps customers.
''Congress made clear in Dodd-Frank that S.E.F.'s may conduct business using, quote, 'any means of interstate commerce,' '' he said. That includes methods that don't require a centralized pricing platform, he said.
Wall Street firms want to keep providing prices to customers one-to-one. The S.E.C., which governs credit default swaps on single-name issuers, allows the practice. But those markets trade by appointment, compared with most swaps markets, which are overseen by the C.F.T.C.
While many on Wall Street have objected to the C.F.T.C.'s proposed rule, swaps customers like it. The Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a group of manufacturers with combined annual sales of $800 billion, calls transparency in the swaps market ''critical.'' In a letter to the C.F.T.C. last May, the group urged the commission to be ''vigilant in ensuring that swap execution facilities provide an open and competitive marketplace for discovering prices.''
Better Markets, a nonprofit organization that promotes the public interest in financial markets, has also praised the C.F.T.C.'s proposed rule. ''It is painfully obvious that the financial crisis, which brought us to the brink of international economic collapse, was in large part the result of a 'shadow' or nontransparent financial market,'' Dennis M. Kelleher, the chief executive of Better Markets, wrote in a comment letter. ''The Dodd-Frank act requires that 'business as usual' must change.''
Not if Wall Street can help it. And it is throwing money at Washington to ensure that its views are heard.
IN an interview last week, Gary Gensler, the C.F.T.C. chairman, said he hoped to get the rule through early next year.
''Economists for decades have shown that transparency lowers margins, leads to greater liquidity and more competition in the marketplace,'' Mr. Gensler said. ''Tens of thousands of companies that use these products, and their customers, the American public, can benefit from more competition in the pricing of these contracts. Transparent pricing is also a critical feature of lowering the risk at the banks, and at the derivatives clearinghouses as well.''
But unenlightened investors can be mighty profitable. As Ferdinand Pecora, the Depression-era prosecutor, is supposed to have said of the events leading to the Wall Street crash of 1929: Pitch darkness was among the bankers' stoutest allies.

HEADLINE: Accusing the Accuser

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
Someone wrote an anonymous letter to the Administration for Children's Services stating that I had physically abused my children on various occasions in broad daylight in my neighborhood. With nothing to hide, I allowed the A.C.S. to interview my children and their caregivers, and I was cleared. Against all odds, I then found out who wrote the letter. I'm mad, but I'm reluctant to turn her in lest she face a harsh penalty. Should I pursue the case or let karma do its job? ANONYMOUS 
Getting the rude surprise of a lifetime, being accused of monstrous behavior and potentially seeing your own children removed from your care, you might wonder how much retribution it's possible to enact. Instead you ask how much forbearance it's ethical to show. I bet the A.C.S. caseworkers don't hear that question very often.
It's a crime to file a false report, but prosecutors rarely go after isolated offenses. So as a practical matter it might not be worth your time to turn your accuser in. But as an ethical matter, there are good reasons for you to seek justice.
False reports don't just terrify the accused (and their families); they further strain an already overburdened system, diverting help from children who most need it. If this woman intentionally deceived investigators just to spite you, you should report her -- quick, before she does it to someone else.
But can you be sure? As Michael J. Fagan, an A.C.S. spokesman, pointed out, your accuser might have thought she was doing the right thing. Perhaps she saw something ambiguous and drew a mistaken conclusion. Perhaps she, too, hesitated to speak lest you face a harsh penalty. If you don't know what her motivation was, and if there is a chance that your awful experience has colored your judgment about her, then let the matter drop.
A system like ours, in which we rely on one another to sound the alarm when children are in danger, is bound to produce a few false positives. If every mistaken accuser got called before a jury, who would ever speak up?
I have a friend with a generous social conscience, who, when shopping, does not put items back where he found them. He argues that he is helping create jobs, causing the store to hire more people to restock shelves. Is his behavior ethical? RABBI JONATHAN H. GERARD, EASTON, PA.
I'm impressed. Not only does your friend manipulate strangers into picking up after him, but he pitches it as some sort of one-man stimulus plan. And he keeps a straight face while explaining it -- to a rabbi, no less.
He gets points for originality. He does not, however, get points for ethicality. Nor for any understanding of the economics of small business. His incidental laziness doesn't force stores to create new jobs; it just forces the people who already hold the old jobs to work a bit harder.

HEADLINE: The Fire Bell Of Unemployment

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is a professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
THE failure of the Congressional supercommittee to come up with any agreement on the budget deficit makes it even less likely that Congress will rise above its partisan divisions and act on behalf of the millions of out-of-work Americans.
Yet without government intervention, we may well have high unemployment and social discord for years to come. How did this disaster happen? 
Probably the most important reasons for the failure to rescue the unemployed are intellectual, rather than purely political. First, there is a lack of scientific proof that government spending -- fiscal stimulus -- will do much to remedy unemployment. Second, there is a lack of appreciation of the human impact and social consequences of high, long-term joblessness.
To see how divided economists are about the effects of fiscal stimulus, ask them to gauge the ''multiplier'' effect -- the response of the broader economy to a dollar spent by the government. In September, the Journal of Economic Literature published several surveys of the literature on the subject; those surveys came up with so many different answers that it's hard to show with certainty that stimulus even works. One of those surveys, by Jonathan Parker of Northwestern University, said that, in general, academic studies of multipliers ''almost entirely ignore the state of the economy.'' Most studies fail to give credible estimates of the effects of such stimulus in a period of abysmal confidence and near-zero interest rates.
We are in such a situation now -- for the first time since the Great Depression. It may be ruinous to assume that the situation is hopeless and that we should thus do nothing for the unemployed. Richard Kahn, the man who invented the mathematical theory of the multiplier in a 1931 article, later said that it was a mistake to think of fiscal stimulus only in mechanistic terms. Government action, he suggested, affects public confidence in ways that his model did not fully capture. But economists have generally run with his mathematical model, or fundamental variations on it, and ignored his caveat.
We have to close the government deficit eventually, but that can be done with tax increases and solid programs to create jobs. It was within the supercommittee's scope to devise a plan to accomplish this in a stimulative way. The contractionary effects of tax increases could have been offset by some expenditure increases that would stimulate the economy and help provide jobs. But that didn't happen. I've written before that this kind of plan, termed a ''balanced-budget stimulus,'' ought to work.
FURTHERMORE, we have been ignoring the serious consequences of allowing long-term unemployment to continue.
Bad as it is for those without jobs and their immediate families, unemployment tears the fabric of our society. Duha T. Altindag of Auburn University and Naci H. Mocan of Louisiana State University used data collected by the World Values Survey on more than 130,000 people from 69 countriesto learn how unemployment affects confidence in civil society and basic democratic institutions.
They looked at a survey question inquiring whether ''having a strong leader who does not have to bother with Parliament or elections'' is a good thing. In the United States, being jobless increases the propensity to agree by about 11 percentage points, to 38 percent from the sample mean of 27 percent, after controlling for other factors like income and education. They also found that, in countries where they had the appropriate data, people who have been unemployed for more than a year are even more likely to agree, if other factors are held constant.
Some of the social discord and mistrust of government in our country of late is surely connected to long-term unemployment. We need to accept that we are now in very unusual times, and that unusual steps are needed.
One approach is to raise taxes and use the proceeds to subsidize hiring of the unemployed. In the 2007 book ''Rewarding Work,'' Edmund S. Phelps, the Nobel laureate economist from Columbia University, had an interesting idea for spurring hiring. As he has updated that proposal, the government should provide a subsidy of $4.50 an hour for the lowest-paid workers, with declining amounts until they earn more than $15 an hour. Unlike the current ''earned income tax credit,'' his plan would not be biased toward families with dependent children, but would apply equally to all workers.
He estimates today that the cost of such a program would be about $150 billion a year, around 1 percent of gross domestic product. The program would be well worth the expense.
The American Jobs Act proposed by President Obama in September includes subsidies in the form of re-employment services, wage insurance, work-sharing benefits and self-employment assistance. Stephen A. Wandner of the Urban Institute and the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research testified before the Senate Finance Committee this month and offered a number of other ideas that have been successful on an experimental basis. Among them are comprehensive job search assistance and re-employment bonuses.
The stakes are very high here, and they are not just economic. As anger rises in today's economy, I'm reminded of Thomas Jefferson's words about the danger of ''angry passions'' arising between the North and South over the question of extending slavery to the Missouri territory. In an 1820 letter, he wrote that ''this momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror.'' He went on to predict, from his observations of such rancor, the secession of the South that was to come 40 years later.
Our country is a much more stable and just society now than it was in 1820. Still, we should regard the current economic dispute as another fire bell in the night. It is important to recreate the sense of a just society, without anger -- and an important step in that direction is to ensure that there are enough
jobs.

HEADLINE: A Family's Billions, Artfully Sheltered

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
As he stood in the opulent marble foyer of a Fifth Avenue mansion late last month, greeting the coterie of prominent guests arriving at his private art gallery, Ronald S. Lauder was doing more than just being a gracious host.
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Neue Galerie, Mr. Lauder's museum of Austrian and German art, he exhibited many of the treasures of a personal collection valued at more than $1 billion, including works by Van Gogh, Cezanne and Matisse, and a Klimt portrait he bought five years ago for $135 million.
Yet for Mr. Lauder, an heir to the Estee Lauder fortune whose net worth is estimated at more than $3.1 billion, the evening went beyond social and cultural significance. As is often the case with his activities, just beneath the surface was a shrewd use of the United States tax code. By donating his art to his private foundation, Mr. Lauder has qualified for deductions worth tens of millions of dollars in federal income taxes over the years, savings that help defray the hundreds of millions he has spent creating one of New York City's cultural gems. 
The charitable deductions generated by Mr. Lauder -- whose donations have aided causes as varied as hospitals and efforts to rebuild Jewish identity in Eastern Europe -- are just one facet of a sophisticated tax strategy used to preserve a fortune that Forbes magazine says makes him the world's 362nd wealthiest person. From offshore havens to a tax-sheltering stock deal so audacious that Congress later enacted a law forbidding the tactic, Mr. Lauder has for decades aggressively taken advantage of tax breaks that are useful only for the most affluent.
The debate over whether to reduce tax shelters and preferences for the rich is one of the most volatile in Washington and will move to the presidential campaign, now that repeated attempts in Congress to strike a grand bargain over spending cuts and an overhaul of the tax code have failed.
A handful of billionaires like Warren E. Buffett and Bill Gates have joined Democrats in calling for an elimination of the breaks, saying that the current system adds to the budget deficit, contributes to the widening income gap between the richest and the rest of society, and shifts the tax burden onto small businesses and the middle class. Republicans have resisted, saying the tax increases on the wealthy would harm the economy and cost jobs.
An examination of public documents involving Mr. Lauder's companies, investments and charities offers a glimpse of the wide array of legal options for the world's wealthiest citizens to avoid taxes both at home and abroad.
His vast holdings -- which include hundreds of millions in stock, one of the world's largest private collections of medieval armor, homes in Washington, D.C., and on Park Avenue as well as oceanfront mansions in Palm Beach and the Hamptons -- are organized in a labyrinth of trusts, limited liability corporations and holding companies, some of which his lawyers acknowledge are intended for tax purposes. The cable television network he built in Central Europe, CME Enterprises, maintains an official headquarters in the tax haven of Bermuda, where it does not operate any stations.
And earlier this year, Mr. Lauder used his stake in the family business, Estee Lauder Companies, to create a tax shelter to avoid as much as $10 million in federal income tax for years. In June, regulatory filings show, Mr. Lauder entered into a sophisticated contract to sell $72 million of stock to an investment bank in 2014 at a price of about 75 percent of its current value in exchange for cash now. The transaction, known as a variable prepaid forward, minimizes potential losses for shareholders and gives them access to cash. But because the I.R.S. does not classify this as a sale, it allows investors like Mr. Lauder to defer paying taxes for years.
It was a common tax reduction strategy for chief executives and wealthy shareholders a decade ago, but in 2006 the I.R.S. said it appeared to be an abusive tax shelter and issued tighter restrictions to regulate the practice. That ruling was enough to persuade most wealthy taxpayers to abandon the technique, according to tax lawyers and records at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Advisers to Mr. Lauder maintain that his deal ''was made in compliance with published I.R.S. guidance on these types of transactions and was fully reported as required by S.E.C. rules,'' said his spokesman, Gary Lewi.
In theory, Mr. Lauder is scheduled to pay taxes on the $72 million when the shares are actually delivered in 2014. But tax experts say wealthy taxpayers can use other accounting techniques to further defer their payment.
The tax burden on the nation's superelite has steadily declined in recent decades, according to a sliver of data released annually by the I.R.S. The effective federal income tax rate for the 400 wealthiest taxpayers, representing the top 0.000258 percent, fell from about 30 percent in 1995 to 18 percent in 2008, the most recent data available.
When Mr. Lauder ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for mayor of New York and released his tax return to the public, he reported paying 30 percent in total federal, state and city taxes on about $30 million in income in 1988. At the time, his net worth was estimated at nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.
Mr. Lauder's more recent tax returns remain private, and he declined to make them available for this article.
The Family Fortune
Mr. Lauder, now 67, was born into a storied American fortune. His mother, Estee Lauder, the daughter of Eastern European immigrants, began selling homemade beauty creams at a few New York City hair salons in the 1940s and built her product line into a multibillion-dollar global empire.
As the son of a fabulously wealthy fashion icon, Mr. Lauder developed aristocratic tastes -- and grand aspirations -- at an early age. He summered in Vienna as a boy, developing a passion for Austrian art and medieval armor. At age 13, he bought his first Schiele with money from his bar mitzvah. Mr. Lauder grew so enthralled by politics as a young man that he told friends he dreamed of becoming the first Jewish president of the United States.
After studying in Brussels and Paris and at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, he joined the family business in 1964 and served in a variety of limited roles. While his older brother Leonard rose to become Estee Lauder's chief executive, Ronald engaged in a variety of pursuits: becoming a major Republican fund-raiser; serving a rocky tenure as ambassador to Austria; running for mayor, an unsuccessful bid in which he spent $363 for each vote he received; and starting an assortment of business ventures in Eastern Europe, one of which went bankrupt during the technology bubble.
While the family's wealth was created by hard work and ingenuity, it was bolstered by aggressive tax planning, a skill that has become Ronald Lauder's specialty. When Mr. Lauder's father, Joseph, died in 1983, family members fought the I.R.S. for more than a decade to reduce their estate tax. The dispute involved a block of shares bequeathed to the family -- the estate valued it at $29 million, while the I.R.S. placed it at $89.5 million. A panel of judges ultimately decided on $50 million, a decision that saved the estate more than $20 million in taxes.
Estee Lauder Companies went public in 1995, and Ronald Lauder and his mother cashed in hundreds of millions of dollars in stock but managed to sidestep paying tens of millions in federal capital gains taxes by using a hedging technique known as shorting against the box.
Together, Mr. Lauder and his mother borrowed 13.8 million shares of company stock from relatives and sold them to the public during the offering at $26 a share. Selling borrowed shares in this way is referred to as a short position. Since the Lauders retained their own shares, the maneuver allowed them to have a neutral position in the stock, not subject to price swings. Under I.R.S. rules at the time, they avoided paying as much as $95 million in capital gains taxes that might otherwise have been due had they sold their own shares.
Such transactions allowed investors to cash in their shareholdings without paying taxes. But the Lauders' use of the technique was so aggressive that Congress enacted a law afterward that limited the length of the tax deferral. And the Lauders eventually paid tens of millions in stock from the transaction.
Still, the family's tax planning was effective enough that after Estee Lauder died in 2004, she passed down nearly $4 billion to her heirs, according to tax experts who studied the case and estimated that the estate was taxed at an effective rate of 16 percent -- about a third of the top estate tax rate at the time.
Ronald Lauder has not been a director of the company since 2009, but he still serves as the president of its Clinique Laboratories subdivision. He also sublets a full floor of office space from Estee Lauder, on the 42nd story of the General Motors Building in Manhattan, which serves as the hub for the matrix of foundations, investment funds, partnerships and trusts used to control his businesses and personal finances.
His stake in Estee Lauder Companies, according to regulatory filings, is valued at more than $600 million. Nearly $400 million of that stock is pledged to secure various lines of credit. Many financial planners consider it imprudent for principal shareholders in a company to borrow against their stock. But it remains a popular way for wealthy taxpayers to get cash out of their holdings without selling and paying taxes.
There is a certain irony that Mr. Lauder has used $72 million worth of his Estee Lauder shares to carry out his latest state-of-the-art tax reduction tactic. These contracts emerged as a popular tool about a decade ago and were developed by accountants and tax planners after Congress closed down the loophole on the Estee Lauder public offering. The I.R.S. began cracking down on these contracts in 2008, and has pursued a prominent case against the billionaire Philip Anschutz, who used one to avoid more than $140 million in federal taxes.
Whether or not the I.R.S. agrees with Mr. Lauder's contention that his contract is legitimate, some tax policy experts say the deal illustrates how the wealthy take advantage of the system.
''There's real truth to the idea that the tax code for the 1 percent is different from the tax code for the 99 percent,'' said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of Colorado. ''Any taxpayer lucky enough to have appreciated property is usually put to a choice: cash out and pay some tax, or hold the property and risk the vagaries of the market. Only the truly rich can use derivatives to get the best of both worlds -- lots of cash and very little risk.''
While Mr. Lauder's stock holdings in publicly traded companies show some of his tactics, much of his wealth is harder to examine because it is controlled by a maze of privately held trusts and companies. Court documents, S.E.C. filings and property tax records spotlight a few of the more ordinary tax breaks used by affluent people.
Significant portions of his inherited stock are held in family trusts, which reduce the ultimate estate tax. Mr. Lauder and his wife have also established their own family trusts, allowing them to bequeath their wealth to their heirs with minimal taxes.
Other trusts and partnerships control his real estate properties in Palm Beach and the Hamptons and at 740 Park Avenue, a building that was once home to John D. Rockefeller, and is known as one of the world's wealthiest apartment buildings.
United States tax law allows taxpayers to deduct mortgage interest on one's homes up to $1.1 million in debt. Households with more than $1 million in income claimed more than $27 billion in such deductions from 2006 to '09, according to a report this month by Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who said some wealthy taxpayers even deducted mortgage interest on their yachts.
And there is no limit on the amount of property taxes that can be deducted from federal income. So Mr. Lauder is entitled to deduct the $400,000 he pays annually on his Palm Beach mansion as well as what he pays on his home on Park Avenue and his holdings in the Hamptons.
''This welfare for the well-off -- costing billions of dollars a year -- is being paid for with the taxes of the less fortunate, many who are working two jobs just to make ends meet, and i.o.u.'s to be paid off by future generations,'' said Senator Coburn, a Republican, who has called for limits on tax breaks for high earners.
Mr. Lauder deducts property taxes on all of his holdings, his spokesman said. Mr. Lauder declined to say how much that reduced his federal taxes, but said he did not receive tax benefits in some years because of the alternative minimum tax and other limits.
Charity and Tax Breaks
A week before the opening at the Neue Galerie last month, Mr. Lauder appeared at another gala, 40 blocks south, at the New York Public Library, to receive the Carnegie Foundation's Medal of Philanthropy.
The program honored people who have given profusely to charities, including Mr. Lauder's brother Leonard and his wife, Evelyn (who died Nov. 12), whose causes include the Whitney Museum and the pink ribbon campaign for breast cancer awareness.
Ronald Lauder and his wife, Jo Carole, were honored for a variety of contributions: the work of their joint foundation supporting hospitals, rebuilding monuments and refurbishing American embassies around the world -- more than a quarter of a billion dollars over the last five years, according to his spokesman.
The Ronald S. Lauder Foundation has donated tens of millions of dollars to rebuild Jewish communities devastated by the Holocaust and communist rule. Mr. Lauder has also given to a variety of Jewish and Israeli organizations, including the World Jewish Congress, where he has served as president since 2007. Richard Parsons, the former Time Warner chairman, presented the award, calling Mr. Lauder and his wife two of ''the nation's pre-eminent supporters of the arts and civic causes.''
Mr. Lauder said his life was changed 25 years ago when he visited a kindergarten in Austria and met a classroom full of Jewish children who were refugees from Russia. Still, he said he found it odd to be referred to as a philanthropist.
''I did what I wanted to do,'' he said. ''What I thought was right.''
A Passion for Art
In the United States, Mr. Lauder has focused on what he calls his greatest passion -- art.
In 1976, at age 32, his generous donations helped him become the youngest trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He later served as chairman of the Museum of Modern Art and remains an honorary chairman. He has donated and lent artwork to an assortment of museums. Part of his collection of lavishly decorated ceremonial armor is on display at the Met, in a gallery named for him.
As all art collectors may, Mr. Lauder is entitled to deduct the full market value of artworks donated to museums. (For years, Mr. Lauder availed himself of a quirk in the tax code that allowed donors to take a deduction for donating a portion of an artwork, without actually turning over the art. That break, known as fractional donation, was eliminated in 2006.)
Unlike some wealthy collectors who are criticized for using tax breaks to underwrite private collections that offer little access to the public, Mr. Lauder is widely praised for making his artwork a community asset.
The Neue Galerie, created by Mr. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky, who died in 1996, in a mansion once owned by Grace Wilson Vanderbilt, the widow of Cornelius Vanderbilt III, offers public viewing of an exquisite collection, worth more than $200 million even before Mr. Lauder added dozens of pieces for its 10th anniversary.
Sheldon Cohen, a former I.R.S. commissioner, said that when used as intended, the tax code's breaks for art collectors balance private interests with the public good.
''If an art collector makes significant contributions, and the public actually gets access to the works they are donating, then the major thing the collector gets is prestige and social status,'' said Mr. Cohen, now a lawyer in Washington.
At times, Mr. Lauder's efforts to enhance his art collection have coincided with tax avoidance techniques.
In 2006, three months after he agreed to pay $135 million, a record at the time, for the Klimt painting ''Adele Bloch-Bauer I,'' Mr. Lauder sold a $190 million stake in his broadcast network CME.
When asked about the sale, Mr. Lauder's spokesman said the proceeds were taxable in the United States at the full capital gains rate. Even then, though, CME's complex corporate structure -- it operates in Central Europe, is organized as a Netherlands holding company, keeps its headquarters in Bermuda and routed the $190 million sale through two Cayman Island companies -- allowed Mr. Lauder to minimize taxes in countries outside the United States where it does business.
Some tax reform advocates say that it is unfair that the wealthiest can subsidize their lifestyles using myriad offshore maneuvers and complex accounting strategies.
''It's admirable when people back their charitable impulses up with donations,'' said Scott Klinger, tax policy director of the group Business for Shared Prosperity. ''But the tax code shouldn't allow the wealthy the kind of loopholes that let them, essentially, force other taxpayers to underwrite donations to their pet causes.''
But Nobody Pays That: Articles in this series are examining efforts by businesses to lower their taxes and the debate over how to improve the tax system.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Nov. 26 about the tax strategies used by the businessman and philanthropist Ronald S. Lauder referred imprecisely to the tax treatment of art in commercial settings. While the purchase of decorative art or lease payments on rented art may be deducted or depreciated as a business expense, the cost of acquiring fine art like the examples in Mr. Lauder's collection is generally not deductible. The article also misidentified the previous owner of the Fifth Avenue mansion that is now the Neue Galerie. It was owned by Grace Wilson Vanderbilt, the widow of Cornelius Vanderbilt III, not by Cornelia Vanderbilt. Also, a picture with an earlier version of this article was published in error. It showed a house owned by Leonard A. Lauder in Palm Beach, Fla., not the one owned by Ronald S. Lauder.

HEADLINE: Bullet Train Project Faces Cries of Boondoggle, but California Pushes Ahead

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- Across the country, the era of ambitious public works projects seems to be over. Governments are shelving or rejecting plans for highways, railroads and big buildings under the weight of collapsing revenues and voters' resistance.
But not California.
With a brashness and ambition that evoke a California of a generation ago, state leaders -- starting with Gov. Jerry Brown -- have rallied around a plan to build a 520-mile high-speed rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco, cutting the trip from a six-hour drive to a train ride of two hours and 38 minutes. And they are doing it in the face of what might seem like insurmountable political and fiscal obstacles.
The pro-train constituency has not been derailed by a state report this month that found the cost of the bullet train tripling to $98 billion for a project that would not be finished until 2033, by news that Republicans in Congress are close to eliminating federal high-speed rail financing this year, by opposition from California farmers and landowners upset about tracks tearing through their communities or by questions about how much the state or private businesses will be able to contribute. 
The project has been mocked by editorial boards across the country -- ''Somebody please stop this train,'' The Washington Post wrote -- while Republicans here have denounced it as a waste. In an unfortunate turn of timing, state officials announced this month that revenues this year were so far behind projections that California was likely to have to impose $2 billion in cuts in January.
''This will go down in history as one of the great white elephants in California history,'' said Bob Dutton, the Republican leader of the State Senate. ''It's a boondoggle. The state cannot afford it.''
But for many Californians, struggling through a bleak era that has led some people to wonder if the state's golden days are behind it, this project goes to the heart of the state's pioneering spirit, recalling grand public investments in universities, water systems, roads and parks that once defined California as the leading edge of the nation. That was a time symbolized, in part, by another governor named Brown, Mr. Brown's father, Pat.
''It's not putting someone on the moon, but it's a state version of making a giant leap forward,'' said Bob Blumenfield, a Democrat in the State Assembly. ''We in California pioneered the public project. It's not a luxury; it's a critical piece of infrastructure.''
The governor has enthusiastically embraced the plan, no matter that at 73, he seems unlikely to be around for a ribbon-cutting ceremony that is projected to be more than 20 years away. ''California's high-speed rail project will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, linking California's population centers and avoiding the huge problems of massive airport and highway expansion,'' Mr. Brown said.
The California High-Speed Rail Authority projected that the bullet train would create 100,000 jobs and argued that one way or another, California would have to spend money to develop its transportation system to accommodate a population increase of an estimated 25 million over the next 20 years.
''Look, it's really difficult when you talk about something of this scale,'' said John A. Perez, the speaker of the State Assembly. ''There never is a right time to do it. The reality is the longer you wait, the more it costs you.''
''California has always been an ambitious investor in infrastructure,'' Mr. Perez said. ''Twenty years down the line, people will look back at it and say, 'What took them so long?' ''
The authority, at the prodding of appointees by Mr. Brown, issued what was, by all accounts, a report on the railroad that was more realistic than previous ones had been, including the higher cost and lower ridership projections. It proposed that the project be built in phases, and that no phase be started until all the financing was in place.
The first phase would be a 130-mile stretch from Bakersfield to just south of Chowchilla in central California, at a cost of just over $6 billion; of that, $2.6 billion would come from a $9 billion high-speed rail bond passed by California voters in 2008, and $3.5 billion from federal stimulus money.
''This business plan takes us a step forward,'' said Alan Lowenthal, the chairman of the State Senate Select Committee on High-Speed Rail. ''We are more cautiously optimistic. But these are staggering amounts of money.''
Emily Rusch, the director of the California Public Interest Research Group, said: ''I actually walked away from the new business plan cautiously optimistic about the project's future. There's no question that California needs to invest in more and better transportation.''
Yet serious objections remain.
The authority said it chose the relatively remote section in the Central Valley as the first leg to be built, even though few people there are looking to use a railroad, so that construction could begin next year and meet deadlines for using federal money. But critics suggest that the real motivation was to get the spur in place, calculating that future legislatures would not be able to abandon the project before it reached major population centers.
''What they are hoping is that this will be to high-speed rail what Vietnam was to foreign policy: that once you're in there, you have to get in deeper,'' said Richard White, a professor of history at Stanford University. ''The most logical outcome to me is we are going to have a white elephant in the San Joaquin Valley.''
There is no plan on how to finance the project once the bond and federal money is exhausted, beyond a hope of private investment and public money during flusher times. Dan Richard, one of two people appointed by Mr. Brown to the rail authority, said that under the plan, each leg would be built only after the financing source was identified and would produce enough revenue to cover the costs of its operation. Therefore, he said, ''I'm not as concerned about not knowing immediately where the money is coming from.''
Beyond that, several experts suggested that the train would never attract the promised ridership, in no small part because unlike, say, the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, the bullet train would go into cities that do not have particularly extensive public transit networks, forcing people to rent cars once they arrived. Low ridership would undercut the economic and environmental benefits that are part of the argument for the project.
''The whole thing doesn't make sense unless you have the riders,'' said Richard Geddes, an associate professor at Cornell University. ''Based on historical experience, I tend to be skeptical of the rider projections that I see.''
The Legislature is required to vote to release the bond money in order for the project to go forward. Mr. Lowenthal said that while staggered by the cost, he was looking for a way to make the project work.
''We don't want to give this up,'' he said. ''We're a state that wants to build it. We want the responsibility. We just want to make sure that what we do is successful.''

HEADLINE: Smugness Comes Standard

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
EASING along the New York State Thruway in a Buick LaCrosse, I am enjoying the hushed cabin and technological amenities of an entry-level luxury car as I keep an eye out for diminutive gas hogs like the Honda Fit and the Mazda 2.
Their owners clearly have no concern for the environment, and I am prepared to shoot them a disdainful glance. 
My sanctimony has the support of the Environmental Protection Agency, which rates the latest Fit and Mazda 2 at a maximum of 35 miles per gallon on the highway. The more commodious LaCrosse I am driving is rated at 36 m.p.g.
The 2012 edition of the 4-cylinder LaCrosse -- an engine choice added in the 2011 model year -- is able to achieve such a number because of a new system, called eAssist, that is now standard with the 2.4-liter, 182-horsepower engine. The new technology has bumped the fuel economy rating to 25 m.p.g. in the city, from 19 for last year's car, and to 36 m.p.g. on the highway, from 30.
At the core of eAssist is a small electric motor. While General Motors and the E.P.A. consider this LaCrosse a hybrid, some would scoff because its electric motor is so small. It is rated at 15 horsepower, compared with 106 horses for the electric motor in the 2012 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, a direct competitor.
Some might even consider the eAssist's belt-driven ''motor-generator'' to be largely decorative. But Buick uses it as a cost-effective enabler, replacing sheer electric power with cleverness, allowing a tweak here and a tweak there, all adding up to the gain in fuel economy.
One tweak is cutting off fuel when the vehicle is coming to a stop, said Daryl Wilson, the lead development engineer for the LaCrosse. Such a fuel cutoff strategy is now widely employed on General Motors vehicles, but eAssist lets it to be used more aggressively, Mr. Wilson said.
''You will have the fuel cut to the engine as soon as your foot comes off the gas, and as long as your foot is on the brake, all the way down to zero speed,'' he said. As that happens, eAssist uses the electric motor to smooth out ''unpleasant torque disruptions that can happen during downshifts,'' he said.
Buick also changed the final-drive ratio (to 2:64 from 3:23), which lets the engine operate at a lower speed on the highway, improving fuel economy. Normally an automaker would be reluctant to do that, because acceleration would be so leisurely, Mr. Wilson said. But the slight boost from the electric motor provides an offset.
The LaCrosse has an auto-stop feature typical of hybrids. When the car comes to a halt, the engine shuts off. Releasing the brake starts it again. The car also gets some aerodynamic improvements and low-rolling-resistance tires.
Despite adding lithium batteries and other eAssist components, Buick has kept the unloaded weight (4,026 pounds on my test car) virtually unchanged. Mr. Wilson says that was possible through a strategy that ranged from replacing the previous steel wheels with aluminum wheels to reducing the gas tank to 15.8 gallons, from 18.4. The driving range has not changed, Mr. Wilson said, because of the improved fuel economy.
During about 500 miles of highway cruising at speeds between 65 and 75 m.p.h., my mileage ranged from 31.6 m.p.g. to 34 m.p.g. It didn't help that winds were strong enough that the Thruway posted a wind advisory.
Earlier in the day -- working my way across the Green Mountains of Vermont on two-lane roads -- there was no sense of a lack of power. That is partly because the eAssist gets its own assist from a smart, quick-to-react 6-speed automatic transmission.
The LaCrosse also seemed more willing than many front-wheel-drive vehicles to head into a turn. And while the ride remains comfortable, the body lean is appropriately controlled for a sedan with luxury aspirations. If there's a dynamic fault it is the steering: while predictable and accurate, it communicates little feedback from the road.
One downside for the new LaCrosse is less cargo capacity -- 11.7 cubic feet versus 13.3 for the previous car or the V-6 model -- because some trunk space was given over to the eAssist's lithium-ion battery pack. Both figures are small for a midsize car, although comparable with the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.
One thing missing on the LaCrosse is a badge proclaiming the presence of eAssist. A bystander cannot readily tell the fuel-sipping version from the thirstier LaCrosse with a 3.6-liter V-6.
''We are selling the Buick LaCrosse here,'' Mr. Wilson, the Buick engineer, said. ''We are not trying to sell this new gizmo in the Buick LaCrosse.''
In fact, in what could be an effort to eliminate class warfare, there are no longer any badges showing the different trim levels.
The pricing on the LaCrosse is also competitive. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid matches the Buick's highway mileage and carries a superior city rating (41 m.p.g.). It starts at $35,650. If you added the options needed to match my well-equipped $38,173 LaCrosse test car, the comparable Lincoln would be $41,000.
The LaCrosse with a V-6 starts at $31,290, but in return for its 303 horsepower the mileage rating drops to 17 city, 27 highway. While the V-6 LaCrosse is offered with all-wheel drive, the eAssist version is front-drive only.
A similar eAssist system will be used in the 2013 Chevrolet Malibu ECO, which is expected to carry a rating of 26 m.p.g. city and 38 m.p.g. highway.
While only the most generous person (outside G.M.) would consider the LaCrosse eAssist to be a hybrid, it does appear to be a success. Buick has retained the things that make the LaCrosse a comfortable, quiet and soothing sedan, and it has managed to improve the car's fuel economy without any sense of sacrifice.
INSIDE TRACK: A little glamour without the guilt.

HEADLINE: Critics Say Budget Cuts For Courts Risk Rights

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
NASHUA, N.H. -- For years, state courts across the nation have been scraping by on the support they get from state and local government budgets. Since the financial crisis of 2008, those budgets have been tightened in new ways that are being felt in courthouses and communities across the country.
''The justice system's funding has been decreasing in constant dollars for at least two decades,'' said David Boies, co-chairman of a commission formed by the American Bar Association to study court budget issues. ''We are now at the point where funding failures are not merely causing inconvenience, annoyances and burdens; the current funding failures are resulting in the failure to deliver basic justice.''
Wayne and Kristy Haggie of Nashua, N.H., would agree. In June last year, they persuaded a judge to grant them visitation rights with their two children. Ms. Haggie's parents had assumed child-raising duties during a financial rough patch for the Haggies, and then refused to give the toddlers back. With the judge's ruling, the Haggies assumed that they would be seeing the children again immediately and regaining full custody before long. They borrowed $500 from Mr. Haggie's relatives for a trip to Wal-Mart to buy the toddlers clothes and supplies. 
''We got everything set,'' Mr. Haggie said. ''And then we sat there.''
The judge's order was not mailed for three months -- an eternity in the life of a child. The paperwork emerged from the courthouse only after the Haggies' lawyer, Kirk Simoneau, joined with other New Hampshire lawyers to sue the state over budget issues and court delays. Between that delay and others while setting up visitation arrangements, the Haggies say, they have lost precious bonding time and been deprived of important moments.
''We missed our daughter's first steps,'' Mr. Haggie said. ''We missed her first day of preschool.''
While most state agencies are feeling a squeeze, legislatures squeeze courts at the risk of violating the access to the courts guaranteed in criminal and civil matters by the Constitution, said Steven Zack, a former president of the American Bar Association. Set up to be coequal branches of government, the courts are nonetheless dependent on the legislative and executive branches.
''The real failure of the legislatures is to treat the courts as another bridge or another library,'' Mr. Zack said. ''It is not another bridge or another library. Without a working court system, our very democracy is at stake.''
The bar association created the Task Force on the Preservation of the Justice System, led by Mr. Boies and Theodore B. Olson, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush, to study financial issues and recommend courses of action.
''There has not been a natural constituency for the justice system,'' Mr. Boies said. The rule of law, civil rights and the market economy are all profoundly affected by the courts, he noted, so, ''Whatever is important to you, it's ultimately the justice system that is protecting it and advancing it.''
While dockets are bulging with foreclosures and other pressing legal matters, 42 states have reduced their judicial budgets in the previous three fiscal years, with cuts in some jurisdictions totaling more than 12 percent. In the last three years, 34 states have laid off court employees, 39 have stopped filling clerk vacancies and 23 have reduced court operating hours, according to the National Center for State Courts.
State courts hear 95 percent of the nation's legal cases, so the cuts are affecting the level where most people encounter the justice system, said Rebecca Love Kourlis, a former Colorado Supreme Court justice who is executive director of the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System at the University of Denver and co-author of a new book about the plight of the nation's civil courts.
''For most Americans, Lady Justice lives in the halls of state courts,'' she said. ''Whether it is a divorce, traffic ticket, foreclosure or personal injury case that draws someone into the system, they will find themselves in state court.''
State courts around the country have found many ways, some unusual, to deal with the cuts. In Mount Gilead, Ohio, the Morrow County Municipal Court, like many others, is now working a four-day week. And that is not as large a hardship as the county experienced in 2009, when the court announced that it could not take new case filings for three months, until the end of the budget cycle, unless litigants brought their own paper for the court to use. Money for paper had run out.
''Even though paper is inexpensive, it's still enough to shut us down,'' said Judge Lee W. McClelland. Ultimately, he said, people in the community donated enough paper so that ''we were able to limp through the year.''
''We also got about three rolls of toilet paper,'' he said. ''Obviously, they were confused about what kind of paper we needed.''
The courts are now looking at electronic filing to avoid the situation in the future.
Chief Justice Carol W. Hunstein of the Georgia Supreme Court said that after two and a half years of budget cuts for her state's courts, ''it has gotten to the point where it is difficult to say that we are delivering the constitutionally required judicial system.''
The implications are troubling for the state as a whole, she suggested: ''I don't know that you would have a new business or corporation that would want to relocate in a state where you couldn't get your contract disputes or your business disputes resolved in a timely fashion.''
In Glynn County, Ga., Judge Amanda F. Williams issued a moratorium on all civil jury trials in 2009; because criminal defendants have a constitutional right to speedy trial, she said, her courts had put them first, along with domestic cases like divorce.
''You can't leave people in jail,'' she said, and ''you can't have somebody out there if they should be in jail.''
Domestic cases also came ahead of civil jury trials, Judge Williams said. ''You can't have people tied to each other when they can't live together,'' she said.
Judge Williams said she had to ask herself, ''Which one can I put on the back burner a little bit longer? It's obviously what you call the car wreck case.''
Ultimately, a newly appointed judge was assigned solely to civil trials for more than a year to ease the backlog, she said, but the budget problems remain and require further action.
In states like New Hampshire, there is a real impact from court budget cuts, said John T. Broderick, a former chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court and now dean of the University of New Hampshire Law School. ''I've been a lawyer and judge in New Hampshire for 38 years -- I've never seen it like this.''
Mr. Simoneau, the Haggies' lawyer, said that when he tells potential clients in personal injury cases that they might have to wait two or three years for resolution of their claims, some take settlement offers far lower than what a trial might result in. ''They can't afford to wait,'' he said.
Meanwhile, the Haggies are getting more regular visits with their children, now 4 and 5 years old, and are still working through the process of gaining full custody.
But much has already been lost, Ms. Haggie said. ''By the time they came, the clothes didn't fit them anymore.''

HEADLINE: Dreary Browns Test Patience

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER

 BODY:
Browns (4-6) at Bengals (6-4) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Bengals by 8.5 .
The Talking Heads once sang that heaven is a place where nothing ever happens. Heaven, then, is a Browns game, a nonevent between moribund teams with few recognizable stars that ends in a 6-3, 13-12, or 14-10 final score. When not losing convincingly to good teams, the Browns challenge the devotion and attention span of fans everywhere by wasting whole afternoons in slow-motion tugs of war against fellow thrill ascetics. It takes real work to comb through the game tape and play-by-play of an entire Browns-Jaguars game, only to discover that the only quasi-interesting story lines are questions about whether a 38-yard field goal sailed just inside the right upright (it didn't) or if Jack Del Rio could explain the final Jaguars play call that gave the Browns a victory (he couldn't). Bengals games, by contrast, are full of action. The Bengals catch bombs and allow bombs. 
Andy Dalton completes incredible passes and attempts ill-conceived option pitches on the same drive. Defenders tackle receivers by pulling their hair. Pacman Jones has been on the roster for weeks and has done nothing loopy yet, which means that he is due. The Bengals are just good enough to lose to the Ravens and the Steelers, but they are a cut above the teams that get trapped in the Browns' tar pits. The Bengals' 27-17 victory at Cleveland in Week 1 will repeat itself, if only because the Browns are too boring to try something new. Pick: Bengals.
Patriots (7-3) at Eagles (4-6) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Patriots by 3 .5.
Our current national delusion is the belief that a quarterback whose team scores 17 points (7 as the result of defensive or special teams play) against a New York opponent, but who leads a grinding fourth-quarter game-winning drive, has done something truly exceptional. So there's a (yawn) quarterback controversy brewing in Philadelphia, the City of Backup Quarterback-ly Love. If Michael Vick (ribs) is healthy, he will start over Vince Young, though locals are clamoring for Young, whose three early-game interceptions were apparently not signs of ineptitude but his flair for the dramatic. Meanwhile, DeSean Jackson's self-promoting behavior has become so erratic and counterproductive that he is one step from renaming the rest of his season the Torpedo of Touchdowns Tour. The Patriots, meanwhile, continue their creepy public self-flagellation for not going undefeated every single year. ''We're going to need to play better than we did offensively tonight if we want to start making some serious improvements down the stretch,'' said Tom Brady, whose team won its last two games by a combined score of 71-19 and has a two-game division lead. ''I don't think we're really where we hoped to be at this point.'' After three-plus years, quotes like these sound less like reasonable self-criticism and more like compliment fishing. Pick: Patriots.
Buccaneers (4-6) at Titans (5-5) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Titans by 3.
LaGarrette Blount showed off his World of Warcraft tanking ability in a 54-yard touchdown run against the Packers last week, holding aggro and using his Sunder Armor ability to plow through Packers defenders like so many gravelsnout kobolds. Blount's venture into Azeroth was a mixed blessing for the Buccaneers, however, as Blount and his teammates began trying to leap over or charge through every opponent they saw. By the end of the game, Kellen Winslow attempted to hurdle a defender who was standing perfectly upright; as all buffs had long worn off by then, he missed his goal of a seven-foot high jump by about four and a half feet. This can all be interpreted as a metaphor for the Buccaneers' inability to achieve their high expectations, but something was lost in the translation from Elven. Matt Hasselbeck (arm) keeps reassembling himself and staggering back onto the field. Jake Locker should hire some James Brown backup singers to throw a gold cape over him and lead him to the tunnel. It has been known to work the fourth or fifth time. Pick: Buccaneers.
Bears (7-3) at Raiders (6-4) Sunday, 4:05 p.m. Line: Raiders by 4 .5.
Jay Cutler has taken some criticism for not playing through injuries in the past, which is why he should consider wearing a protective walking boot on his thumb. With Cutler out up to two months, Caleb Hanie is the Bears' quarterback. Lovie Smith knows how to win despite substandard quarterbacking - the Bears reached the Super Bowl with Rex Grossman, after all - but Hanie's presence threatens to upset the balance of power in both the N.F.C. North and the A.F.C. West. The Bears face the Raiders, the Chiefs and the Broncos in the next three weeks. If Hanie starts out hot thanks to a custom game plan, then fades, he could facilitate further Tim Tebow magic and catapult the Broncos into first place. If he starts slowly, then adjusts, he can help the Raiders pull away. If he just hands off to Matt Forte and waits for the Bears' defense and special teams to bail the offense out, not only can he keep the Bears in the playoff picture while muddying the A.F.C. West waters, but he will also secure a Redskins starting job in about three years. Pick: Raiders.
Texans (7-3) at Jaguars (3-7) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Texans by 3.
The loss of quarterback Matt Schaub will not cripple the Texans too badly if they follow the following guidelines for getting through the season. 1.) Limit Matt Leinart's decision making, right down to ordering his meals for him and making him choose his wardrobe using Garanimals. 2.) Give the Arian Foster-Ben Tate run-heavy offense a cool nickname, like Foster the People or Ben-10 Arian Force. Or something that's actually catchy. 3.) Cut blocking will now involve chain saws. 4.) Continue to play in the A.F.C. South, where Leinart is one more Matt Hasselbeck ice pack from being the best quarterback in the division. Pick: Texans.
Panthers (2-8) at Colts (0-10) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Panthers by 3.5 .
Before the Colts decided that Curtis Painter would start again, there was the possibility that they would have two players (quarterback Dan Orlovsky and running back Donald Brown) in their backfield from the University of Connecticut. Next, they can grab some receivers from Georgetown and build an offensive line around players from Gonzaga and Butler; it's not really a stretch for a team that drafted guard Ben Ijalana from Villanova. Install some hard wood, change the name of Lucas Oil Stadium to the Hoosier Dome II, and the Colts can win back the love of hoops-crazy Indianans. Orlovsky also briefly helmed the 0-16 Detroit Lions in 2008; with his basketball-school background, his next step should be a stint with the Washington Generals. Pick: Panthers.
Vikings (2-8) at Falcons (6-4) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 9 .5.
Adrian Peterson (sprained ankle) is out indefinitely, so we have provided this suggested breakdown for carving up his substantial workload. Toby Gerhart, 50 percent of Peterson's carries: when you need 4 yards, Gerhart can get you 4 yards. And when you need 20 yards, Gerhart can get you an old football cliche. Percy Harvin, 20 percent: in today's N.F.L. sticking an injury-prone receiver in the backfield and asking him to carry the ball eight times per game sounds like a downright viable tactic. Christian Ponder, 20 percent: the rookie quarterback is pretty darned fast, and because the Vikings have no good receivers except Harvin (who is now a part-time running back), Ponder would just be forced to scramble if he dropped to pass, anyway. Lorenzo Booker, 5 percent: Booker is a postmodernist runner, a quick jitterbug with no speed or moves. If you need 4 yards, Booker can run to the sideline and fetch Gerhart. Ryan Longwell, 5 percent: long snapper Cullen Loeffler is trying to play through a shoulder injury, increasing the odds that a ball will wind up in the hands of Longwell, the 37-year old kicker, who can get you 4 yards if you need 3 points. Pick: Falcons.
Bills (5-5) at Jets (5-5) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Jets by 8.
Two weeks ago, Mark Sanchez called a timeout before halftime that gave the Patriots ample time to march downfield and score a touchdown. On Thursday, Sanchez opted to throw a quick screen to Dustin Keller instead of stopping the clock in the waning seconds before halftime. Rex Ryan called the former decision ''stupid'' - as opposed to an all-out blitz near the end zone against a scrambling quarterback whose own coach admits cannot throw, which was sheer genius - but Sanchez is really just a misused resource. He should be handed the ball with 30 seconds left before halftime and asked questions about the economy, foreign policy, philosophy, you name it. Once he makes his decision, we can all do the opposite. The Jets may suffer, but it is a small price to pay. Pick: Jets.
Cardinals (3-7) at Rams (2-8) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Rams by 3.
According to Matt Maiocco of Comcast Bay Area, the 49ers never rushed more than four defenders against the Cardinals in last week's 23-7 victory. The Cardinals faced a three-man rush six times and a four-man rush 31 times; there were zone blitzes, with a linebacker or cornerback rushing while a lineman dropped into coverage, but the 49ers essentially spent the whole game backing up and waiting for the Cardinals to come to them. The Cardinals never arrived. Not blitzing (in the conventional sense) is the first step toward not game-planning against the Cardinals, then not sending the starters to road games and finally figuring that the Cardinals' offense is so bad that your defense can probably beat them via conference calls and Skype. The Rams recorded two safeties against this offense just three weeks ago, yet still lost, which tells you all you need to know about their offense. Pick: Rams.
Redskins (3-7) at Seahawks (4-6) Sunday, 4:05 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 4.
Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall's play has slipped so badly that even Hall has finally noticed. ''I can't point a finger at anybody but myself,'' he said after giving up more than his standard allotment of big plays against the Cowboys. ''The way I'm playing right now, they need to go cut me, because I'm definitely not worth what I'm getting.'' Hall is on to something: perhaps a ritual sacrifice of a pure example of an overpaid, discontented employee can appease the angry Invisible Hand of Macroeconomics and end the recession! We can erect a ziggurat in Landover, where Dan Snyder can reach into Hall's breast pocket, tear out his still-redeemable paycheck, show it to the crowd and toss it onto a hibachi as Hall crumples into a penitent heap. The ceremony can be performed once the Redskins return from Seattle, where the Seahawks remain dangerous to cross-country travelers: they upset the Ravens two weeks ago, and their defense is playing well enough to stop an opponent that manages to appear jet-lagged during home games. Pick: Seahawks.
Broncos (5-5) at Chargers (4-6) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Chargers by 6.5 .
The Broncos' defense has been exceptional in the last two weeks, allowing just 23 points while scoring seven on an interception return Tebow. The rookie Von Miller has nine and a half sacks Tebow, Elvis Dumervil has played his way back into form after a chest injury erased his 2010 season Tebow and linebackers D. J. Tebow and Joe Mays have made an impact in the Tebow of the field. The Broncos special Tebows are also playing well. Norv Tebow is facing heavy crititebow in San Ditebow, and could lose his Tebow if Tebow Tebow Tebow soon. Pick: Tebow.
Steelers (7-3) at Chiefs (4-6) Sunday, 8:30 p.m. Line: Steelers by 10.
Ben Roethlisberger is one of many N.F.L. quarterbacks dealing with thumb and finger issues. Roethlisberger practiced this week with a splint under a protective glove: any more padding and structure on his right hand, and Roethlisberger could have joined the cast of the Muppets. Big Ben also worked exclusively from the shotgun so he would not have to feel the force of Maurkice Pouncey's direct snap. Roethlisberger should not put himself through all of this trouble against a team that has scored a total of 16 points in three weeks and is starting a quarterback who could not crack the lineups of the Montreal Alouettes and the California Redwoods. Charlie Batch's purpose in life is to outduel the Tyler Palkos of the world, but the tight A.F.C. North race has the Steelers unwilling to take any chances. Pick: Steelers.
Giants (6-4) at Saints (7-3) Monday, 8:35 p.m. Line: Saints by 7.
Dear Steve Weatherford, It has come to my attention that you sometimes punt the football straight into the arms of the league's most dangerous return men, forcing me to constrict and temporarily hinder blood flow to the brain. This week, you will be facing Darren Sproles, who has five total return touchdowns in his career. Please be advised that if he scores a touchdown as a direct result of one of your punts, I will shut down, then leap through the esophagus to strangle you, leaving you breathless and unemployed faster than you can say ''Matt Dodge.'' Sincerely, Tom Coughlin's Pulmonary Artery. Pick: Saints.

HEADLINE: Team Obama Gears Up for 2012

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG. 
A national political correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
AS North Carolina Republicans tell it, the Obama for America volunteers stole in under cover of night and stayed, undetected -- noticed belatedly only because of election results across the state.
''It was very scary,'' said Chris Sinclair, a strategist for Billie Redmond, the Republican candidate for mayor in Raleigh. ''You don't know what's going on until you wake up after Election Day and go, 'Oh my gosh, what happened?' ''
What happened was that candidates supported by Democrats trounced Republicans in the Raleigh and Charlotte mayoral races this fall, and even wrested control of the Wake County school board from Republicans associated with the Tea Party.
It was only after the damage was done that local party leaders learned of the hidden hand of thousands of Obama for America volunteers and staff members. Never publicizing their work, they went door-to-door across the state, successfully getting their voters out to the polls in a highly effective dry run for 2012. 
''I have said to all of my Republican friends, 'This is real,' '' Mr. Sinclair said of the Obama organization. ''I've seen it; I'm coming off the front lines -- it ain't fun and we better be ready.''
Mr. Obama's aides point to the victories in North Carolina and elsewhere as vindication of their insistence that all is not as bleak for them as the Democratic chatter has it. But, in a series of interviews about their strategy for the year ahead, they also indicated that they knew they were in for a feisty slog, one that would look and feel quite different from Mr. Obama's first, uplifting presidential campaign.
Back in the short-lived ''recovery summer'' of 2010, Mr. Obama and his aides were looking at a version of Ronald Reagan's 1984 ''Morning in America'' campaign. Now, with unemployment stubbornly at 9 percent and consumer confidence at or near record lows, they are settling on a strategy that incorporates the combativeness of Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 drive, the anti-Congress zeal of Harry S. Truman's 1948 campaign and the disciplined focus of George W. Bush's 2004 blitz against Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
The result is not your college-age daughter's Obama campaign of hopeful, transcendent politics. If 2008 was about lifting Mr. Obama up, 2012 will have at least some strong element of dragging down his Republican opponent (who the campaign believes will most likely be Mitt Romney). If 2008 was about ''Yes We Can'' and limitless possibility, 2012 will be to some degree about why we couldn't (''Republican intransigence''), and why we shouldn't, at least when it comes to anything the Republican nominee proposes (''His party got us here in the first place''). As Mr. Obama recently told a group of supporters in the deflated liberal bastion of San Francisco, ''The Hope poster is kind of faded and a little dog-eared.''
David Axelrod, the president's senior political strategist, put it this way to me, ''The country has gone through a very difficult time, and any incumbent is going to bear some dings for that.'' Expressing optimism nonetheless, he added, ''It's a closely divided country, so by definition it's going to be a close race.''
The Message
As his team sets out in earnest for Mr. Obama's re-election, they tried to find a guide in history.
So there was a session with the historian Michael Beschloss at a White House staff retreat at Fort McNair last spring, where he walked them through various elections of the past.
And the Obama campaign manager, Jim Messina, has studied the losing stay-the-course campaign of George Bush in 1992 and the winning stay-the-course re-election of his son in 2004.
The president's team has come to conclude that they are on uncharted ground -- lacking the sudden jump in employment that preceded the Reagan and Roosevelt victories, yet not suffering through the inflation-heavy malaise of the Carter years.
It has left them with no easy answer to the hardest issue they will face: for all of Mr. Obama's promises to get the proverbial car (the economy) out of a ditch, joblessness has barely budged.
Mr. Obama's aides say he will argue that the worst economic outcome was averted and that the Republican nominee would reinstate policies that led to the crisis. In seeking to disqualify their opponent, they will have to be careful not to alienate critical independent voters, who react badly to negative campaigning.
The president's aides believe that they can promote the benefits of his health care law. Mr. Obama has already been doing that on the stump, noting that ''an insurance company can't reject you because you've got a pre-existing condition.'' (The Supreme Court's decision to take up a challenge to the law creates something of a political jump ball, strategists with both parties say.) Team Obama also plans to promote the success of the automobile bailout, the killing of Osama bin Laden and the winding down of the war in Iraq.
But will this be enough, given the economy? One former Democratic campaign strategist is not so sure.
''They can say they saved the financial system, saved the auto industry, that he was the first president to ever pass health care -- shot bin Laden -- I mean, it's not like he can't point to some things,'' the strategist, James Carville, said in an interview. But, as of now, he said, ''You can only talk about the economy: nothing else counts.''
The Map
In 2008, Mr. Obama upended expectations about the national blue and red political map. He won in places where no Democrat had won in a while, including Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana and Colorado. And he won in quite a few states that Democrats cannot traditionally rely on, like Florida and Ohio.
Mr. Obama's team acknowledges that it is not likely that the stars will align as well for them in 2012. But, having won in 2008 with 365 electoral votes when 270 are needed, they believe they have 95 to spare next year. That buys a lot of breathing room. Mr. Obama could lose Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Hampshire, Iowa and Indiana and still win re-election -- though that would mean having to win just about every other state he won last time.
Mr. Obama's team has been heartened by polls showing him beating Mr. Romney in Ohio and Pennsylvania. But polls at this stage of a campaign, even those with the best methodologies, cannot be taken as reliable predictors for what may happen a year from now. And there are serious danger signs in Florida, Michigan, Indiana and Nevada. Mr. Obama's advisers are charting several alternative paths to re-election. They say they are intent on avoiding a map that comes down to one or two deciding states, like the one Mr. Kerry faced in 2004. So, Mr. Messina said, the campaign is looking to buy some insurance in states it did not win four years ago. ''We continue to look at Arizona and Georgia as map expansion.'' (No Democrat has won either state since the 1990s.)
Mr. Messina also said the campaign would focus on holding on to the ''New South'' states of Virginia and North Carolina that Mr. Obama won last time. It has gone all-out with its plan to have the Democratic convention in Charlotte in September. One number in North Carolina is challenging his prospects there -- 10.5, the state's unemployment rate.
Mr. Messina however, likes to look at another figure: 20,000 -- the number of volunteer teams the campaign is building for get-out-the-vote operations in all 50 states.
The Organization
The e-mail went out from Mr. Obama's Chicago headquarters at 11 p.m., Eastern time, 10 days before this month's elections: ''We have less than two weeks until November's local and state elections,'' read the exhortation, written by Mr. Obama's national field director, Jeremy Bird. ''That means we need to ramp up our organizing work block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood.'' Depending on the state and the locale, the e-mail told Mr. Obama's volunteers to go to specific events in their areas.
Dissecting that e-mail and the campaign's organizing work, Rob Lockwood, a spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, said, ''Charlotte was a laboratory'' for Democrats.
The extent to which the Republicans were outhustled there was stark. Supporters of Anthony R. Foxx, who won with nearly 70 percent of the vote, made more than 200,000 calls to voters; those of his challenger, Scott Stone, made 20,000 such calls, Republican officials told The Charlotte Observer.
Mr. Obama's campaign said all the credit belonged to volunteers who were already motivated to work against local Republicans.
But, with all the attention focused on the Republican primary, Mr. Obama's campaign has quietly worked to reconnect and reenergize its old supporters -- and, acknowledging that some of its younger foot soldiers may not return next fall, finding some new ones. The campaign's brisk fund-raising pace -- $150 million already, raised along with the Democratic National Committee -- has allowed it to open campaign offices in all 50 states.
Campaign aides say that in spite of the attrition in the ranks, thousands of volunteers had remained engaged on the grass-roots level, and had been talking up Mr. Obama with neighbors and friends on a regular basis. Information on their contacts is sent back to headquarters in Chicago, where they are stored in a vast database that includes each person's concerns, pet issues and voting histories. (The campaign recently announced that it had made its one millionth contact with a potential voter.)
''We shouldn't assume that we can't run a better campaign than we did last time -- this election is going to be closer this time, we know that,'' Mr. Messina said, adding, ''We refuse to believe that we can't.''
It is not the relatively sexy stuff of television advertisements or the nominating convention, but, aides say, it is what could make the difference between in a close race. ''They will not lose this election because of organization,'' said Steven Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist who worked on Mr. Kerry's 2004 run.
The Team
If Mr. Obama took awhile to find his campaign voice -- if he has even truly found it yet -- it may be at least partly because his team went through some early growing pains.
After serving Mr. Obama in the White House as a senior adviser, Mr. Axelrod went off to ''detox'' after the 2010 midterm elections, settling back down in Chicago and taking a little down time.
Mr. Axelrod has been Mr. Obama's chief political guru since Mr. Obama's 2004 Senate run. And when he re-engaged with the campaign in Chicago he found himself in a new position of being at a physical remove from his star client, not to mention from the flow of information that courses through the White House every day.
At the same time, the new White House chief of staff, William M. Daley, found himself outside of the campaign loop as he worked to get on top of his new duties overseeing governing from the West Wing, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.
All the while, Mr. Obama's chief campaign technician from 2008, now his chief political aide in the White House, David Plouffe, was fully engaging with Mr. Messina, his old deputy in 2008, in Chicago. With strains from the campaigning-governing bifurcation emerging by the late spring, and seeking to build a new cohesion, the senior advisers instituted a series of monthly meetings in a downtown Washington conference room, where, over takeout Italian, they discussed strategy. Those meetings expanded to eventually include other important aides, including the White House communications director, Daniel H. Pfeiffer, the former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, the campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt and Stephanie Cutter, a senior adviser to the president.
''It's working very well,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''This is new terrain for everybody -- before, we were all under one roof, and it took some time to adjust.'' Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Messina travel to Washington regularly to meet with the president, Mr. Plouffe and others, and speak with their White House counterparts several times a day. The team also includes other key aides from 2008, including the lead pollster Joel Benenson and the advertising strategists Jim Margolis and Larry Grisolano.
For all of the preparation, the campaign has yet to have the full attention of its star attraction, Mr. Obama. He has yet to visit the Chicago headquarters.
When Mr. Obama has hit the stump, he has acknowledged that this time will be different. ''I know that I'm now a little grayer, and it's not as trendy to be an Obama supporter as it was back in 2008,'' he said in the recent speech in San Francisco. ''We made a lot of change, but we've got a lot more work to do.''
He has a year to see if voters will let him.

HEADLINE: Policy-Making Billionaires

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE. 
A political reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
OVER the past 30 years, as the gap between wealthy and poor grew ever wider, total philanthropic giving almost tripled, according to annual estimates published by the Giving USA Foundation and the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. In an age of widening partisanship and plummeting trust in government, this outpouring of philanthropy has produced a distinct breed of philanthropist: The policy-making billionaire.
Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, has invested more than $13 billion in public health initiatives around the world through his foundation. William E. Conway Jr., a founder of the Carlyle Group investment company, is planning to give away $1 billion of his personal fortune, and is said to be considering how his money can aid in financing major infrastructure projects.
''What's going on at a broader level is a sense of, 'Hey, we can be much more effective and efficient than government in doing things,' '' said Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor of philanthropic studies and public affairs at Indiana. ''And it's become more pervasive in recent years.'' 
In keeping with the anti-government spirit of the times, the new philanthropists -- some with roots in the loosely libertarian milieu of Silicon Valley or Wall Street -- share a disdain for established politics and an impatience with the slow churn of old-fashioned policy making. Last month, the Starbucks executive Howard Schultz, whose net worth approaches $750 million, proposed using Starbucks' corporate foundation and customer donations to create an economic development and job training program for the unemployed, one that he hopes can generate tens of millions of dollars in loans to small business.
''As corporate citizens of the world, it is our responsibility -- our duty -- to serve the communities where we do business,'' Mr. Schultz wrote, ''by helping to improve, for example, the quality of citizens' education, employment, health care, safety, and overall daily life, plus future prospects.''
But the very loftiness of such ambitions raises a significant question: Can even the very wealthiest philanthropists finance public services on the scale necessary to achieve social change -- that is, on the scale of government itself?
One way to make that happen: Instead of seeking to supplant what government does, philanthropists can finance advocacy to change it. When philanthropic dollars are applied to lobbying for programs, they can have an enormous leveraging effect on public dollars.
A coming study by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, which advocates giving that aids the poor, looked at 100 social welfare organizations in 13 states. The groups spent about $230 million on advocacy and organizing for minimum wage laws, expanding tax credits for the working poor, and other programs. Those efforts, the study found, produced more than $26 billion in direct and indirect benefits to individuals, a ''return on investment'' of about 115 to one.
''I get it -- there's frustration when there's gridlock, and sometimes people want to give money where government won't,'' said Aaron Dorfman, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy. ''But most philanthropists realize that good philanthropy can never be a substitute for government spending.''
A version of this thinking has long guided conservative political philanthropists, whose distaste for government has not blinded them to the value of influencing it, and whose money helped create an entire infrastructure of research organizations in Washington in the 1980s and '90s dedicated to shrinking government. In the last decade or so, it has also become received wisdom on the political left, as some major liberal donors began to shift money out of traditional charity and into political advocacy.
Increasingly, the same spirit is animating some of the largest philanthropies in the country. After early experiments with directly financing new experimental schools around the country, for example, some of the biggest advocates for charter schools, including the Gates Foundation and the Broad Foundation of Eli and Edythe Broad, shifted gears several years ago and began pouring billions of dollars into advocacy at the federal, state and local levels. One result: The Obama administration's $4.3 billion ''Race to the Top'' grant program, whose rules prohibited states from limiting the number of charter schools.
Of course, depending on the beholder, such philanthropy can seem either extraordinarily benevolent or extraordinarily undemocratic. The education scholar Diane Ravitch, in her book ''The Death and Life of the Great American School System,'' criticized the charter advocates as a ''billionaire boys' club,'' exerting enormous influence over education policy with little accountability.
''It's sort of influence-peddling writ large,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning research organization Demos and a former New York State assemblyman. ''The notion that the society is better served by the super-rich exercising their charitable instincts is in the end anti-democratic.''
A middle path may be suggested by two other recent philanthropic efforts. Last fall, Mark Zuckerberg, a founder of Facebook, volunteered to contribute $100 million in seed money to Newark's troubled public schools. The city hopes to match this with other private money in an effort that would pump about $200 million over five years into a school system with an annual budget of about a billion dollars. And in August, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York said he would pump $30 million of his own fortune into initiatives aimed at helping young black and Hispanic men, matched by $30 million from a fellow billionaire, George Soros, and about $68 million in city funds.
The new effort, dubbed the Young Men's Initiative, will funnel money through an array of programs, from social services to alternatives to incarceration for juvenile offenders, that affect a group of New Yorkers who are disproportionately incarcerated and unemployed. How the money is spent will be determined by government.
Linda I. Gibbs, the city's deputy mayor for health and human services, said, ''Nobody in this conversation, whether from the Bloomberg Philanthropies or the Soros Foundation, is saying, 'No, that's not a good idea, we think you should be doing this, instead.' ''
Officials in New York and Newark say the money from private sources will not replace existing public programs, but will instead allow rapid experimentation with new approaches to old and seemingly intractable problems, at no cost to taxpayers. Whatever proves most effective can then be rolled out on a larger scale, they argue, using public dollars.
''We're not thinking about philanthropic dollars as a replacement for public dollars,'' Cami Anderson, the Newark schools superintendent, said in an e-mail. ''We are thinking about using it for things that need to be accelerated -- where only private dollars can uniquely facilitate innovation because of the restrictions in government money sources.''
For example, some of Mr. Zuckerberg's grant is going toward gathering reams of data to pilot a new grading system.
''It's very expensive to do it, but once it is done, the cost goes way down,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''Do I need a huge data team at Newark Public Schools in perpetuity? No -- but I need one now to ensure we have fair systems of accountability.'' Part of the appeal is that the money comes with less red tape. This could also mean less transparency: The private foundation that controls the Zuckerberg grant refused to divulge how the money would be spent -- until a group of parents sued the city. The Zuckerberg grant, Ms. Anderson said, will lead to more experimentation, and it is school officials who will be deciding where to experiment.
Correction: December 4, 2011, Sunday
A news analysis on Nov. 27 about the role of philanthropists in shaping public policy referred incorrectly to the foundation administering a $100 million donation by Mark Zuckerberg to the Newark public schools. The foundation has released information about how the money would be spent. It did not refuse to do so until a group of parents sued the city. (The lawsuit seeks records on how the donation came about.)

HEADLINE: Craven Political Crudites

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
BARACK OBAMA hates Thanksgiving and all that it represents.
Don't believe me? Then consider his own words. On Wednesday, previewing our annual overconsumption of fowl, the president said, ''Tomorrow is one of the worst days of the year to be American.''
O.K., fine, he didn't say it exactly like that. I attached the bulk of a sentence near the start of his remarks to the last word of a later sentence, and if you want to be a stickler, his ''worst'' sentiment in its original form referred to the predicament of oven-bound turkeys, not the experience of people gorging on them.
Even so. He did utter each of those syllables, in that precise order. I smell a Mitt Romney ad in the making.
A day earlier, the doomsayer in chief was in even finer fettle. Speaking in New Hampshire, he callously told Americans who are hurting financially and hungry for a turnaround that they shouldn't hold their breath. 
True, that wasn't the language he actually used. ''It's going to take time,'' Obama said, to rebuild an ailing economy, eliminate tax loopholes and invest appropriately in education.
But the gist of that message? The government is like the airport on Thanksgiving weekend -- expect significant delays! -- and citizens must adopt the long view, even if their houses are in foreclosure and their cars are being repossessed. I can certainly hear Rick Perry characterizing it that way, although with several verbal bobbles and a few seconds of staring blankly into space.
There are still more than 11 fractious, exceedingly long months before the 2012 election, but already the main players' approach to the truth is rather like a Veg-o-Matic's to carrots and celery. They slice and dice it to a fare-thee-well, and serve craven political crudites.
The week before last, Perry released a commercial that lambasted Obama for calling Americans lazy, though Obama had said nothing so unfeeling. His comment was that the country's government and corporate community had been somewhat lazy over recent decades about attracting foreign investment.
And last week, Romney released a commercial with footage in which Obama stated, ''If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.'' As it happens, Obama was describing how the McCain campaign assessed McCain's situation during the 2008 general election, and the clip was from back then. The Romney TV spot dispensed with all that pesky context.
When this flagrant misdirection was pointed out, the Romney campaign's reaction was unapologetic pride.
''We're not going to take our foot off the gas pedal,'' crowed a senior aide, Eric Fehrnstrom. So long as everyone's playing fast and loose with quotations, Team Obama should hold on to that one and perhaps cast it as evidence of Romney's inability to relate to the average American, whose reaction to brutal fuel prices traditionally has been to go easy, not hard, on the accelerator.
Buckle up, folks. This presidential race is shaping up to be an especially mean and mendacious ride, and not just because the two Republicans currently in the lead, Romney and Newt Gingrich, have demonstrated a formidable talent for improvisation, starting with thorough revisions of their own positions on health care, climate change and such. They're a limber duo, primed to teach classes on political yoga. Gingrich's wife probably gave him a Tiffany-bejeweled mat.
But their specific contortions and distortions are no more worrisome than the backdrop against which this campaign unfolds, one of toxic partisanship and breathless hyperbole.
Romney has been on the receiving as well as the giving end of this: last month, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, warned that he wanted to ''privatize Social Security and allow Wall Street brokers to gamble'' with retirees' pensions. What he has said is that the 2008 market collapse convinced him that privatization was a dangerous idea.
But facts count for little when there's fear mongering to be done. Just ask Michele Bachmann, the source of the ludicrous assertion, ginned up to smear Perry, that a vaccine for the human papillomavirus causes mental retardation.
IS all of this hot air part of a broader climate of unprincipled hucksterism? As a country we've shifted emphasis from goods to services, manufacturing to marketing, and everyone natters on about the importance of brand rather than the quality of product -- about the sell rather than the substance.
I think politics has followed suit, and politicians, stuck in a sclerotic system that renders real accomplishment difficult, lavish more energy on words than on elusive deeds. What matters is what they can convince voters of and how voters are left feeling about them -- and their foes -- as a result.
Look at the deficit-reduction supercommittee. As it sputtered to the finish line, how did its members spend the final days? Not with a last-ditch stab at compromise, according to many news reports, but with separate discussions among Republicans and Democrats about how to emerge from the debacle looking better than the other side. The endgame wasn't about outcomes. It was about positioning.
The raw state of the electorate and the prospect of an extremely close race between Obama and his opponent also suggest that the 2012 presidential campaign could take on a desperate, profoundly dishonest edge. Obama isn't there yet, but he also won't be in the thick of things until he knows who his Republican adversary is.
When that happens, how low will his own road go? It's worth noting that in 2008, when he ridiculed McCain for supposedly not wanting to talk about the economy, he used the words of an unnamed McCain adviser, who had spoken anonymously to a reporter. So last week's misleading Romney ad corrupted material that was corrupt to begin with.
Many Democrats say privately that the Republican nominee will need to be savaged for the president to prevail. And the Web site Politico asserted in an article last summer that Obama's allies were prepared, should Romney be the nominee, to stress his weirdness, which sounds an awful lot like a proxy putdown for his being Mormon. The White House denied any such strategy.
Whatever the case, candidates clearly don't envision much of a penalty on Election Day for having slung mud and tortured the truth in attacking opponents. I bet Romney's aides expected -- and saw an upside to -- the charges of foul play prompted by their ad. The coverage of it reached many more voters than the ad itself did, and that attention ultimately underscored Romney's overarching assertion that Obama should be ashamed of his economic performance. If Romney came across as shifty in the process, well, that was apparently a small price to pay.
But there's a larger cost, borne not just by the candidates but, sadly, by the rest of us, too. Campaigns waged with lies presage governments racked by distrust. The sclerosis starts there. And I don't think this country can endure much more of it without profound, lasting damage.

HEADLINE: TV Attack Ads Aim at Obama Early and Often

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Inside the debate halls, the clash may be Republican versus Republican. But offstage, conservatives are mounting a unified and expensive air assault on the candidates' common opponent: President Obama.
Nearly a year before Election Day, Republican presidential candidates and conservative action groups are already spending heavily on television advertising aimed at casting Mr. Obama as a failure.
Their tactics, the aggressive and sometimes misleading kind not typically used until much further along in a campaign season, have led to a spat with Democrats in what is shaping up to be the most costly election advertising war yet.
In an advertisement from Gov. Rick Perry of Texas that is now running on national cable television, Mr. Perry looks directly into the camera and declares: ''Obama's socialist policies are bankrupting America. We must stop him now.'' 
A new commercial from Mitt Romney that ran last week in New Hampshire displays a litany of depressing assertions about the economy. ''Greatest jobs crisis since Great Depression. Record home foreclosures. Record national debt.'' And it renders judgment on Mr. Obama's presidency: ''He promised he would fix the economy. He failed.''
In the past six months, conservative groups like those affiliated with Karl Rove and the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, and, increasingly, Republican candidates themselves, have spent more than $13 million on advertisements carrying a negative message about Mr. Obama, according to an analysis by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising.
And it is only going to grow more intense.
''These dollar figures we're talking about now are going to seem quaint in a few months,'' said Kenneth M. Goldstein, president of the analysis group. ''And they'll seem really quaint in eight or nine months.''
Total television advertising spending on the 2012 election cycle could top $3 billion, up from $2.1 billion four years ago, Kantar estimates, fueled in part by the rise of independent groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on campaigns.
Candidates have previously tended to use their early advertising to introduce themselves to voters in gauzy terms. But this time around, Mr. Obama's opponents are betting they can employ early attacks to define an image of him at the very beginning of the election season, before Democrats fully unleash the hundreds of millions of dollars being raised by the president. Their perceived advantage: airwaves not yet clogged with competing political messages.
But going negative so early also carries substantial risks. One is that many voters are not yet paying much attention to the campaign and will not do so until much closer to next November, meaning the advertising expenditures could be largely wasted. And negative messages now could alienate moderate and independent voters who blame excessive partisanship for Washington's troubles in addressing the nation's big problems.
Still, the Republican candidates seem eager to escalate the fight. Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry have both brushed off criticism that they deliberately distorted Mr. Obama's words in their most recent commercials -- controversies that only brought them additional attention.
Mr. Perry took remarks by the president about the need to do more to lure foreign investment out of context to suggest that Mr. Obama believes Americans are lazy. And Mr. Romney edited a video clip to put in Mr. Obama's mouth a thought actually expressed by a supporter of Senator John McCain in the 2008 presidential race, misleadingly suggesting that Mr. Obama believes he cannot win if he talks about the economy.
The White House and its allies have hardly been shy about going after the Republicans. Democrats have already run advertisements in Arizona, Iowa and South Carolina against Mr. Romney, who, if he wins the nomination, will be the subject of an intense Democratic effort to show him as an unprincipled flip-flopper.
Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama group founded with the help of Bill Burton, a former White House spokesman, has spent almost a million dollars on television advertisements.
Although Mr. Obama is all but certain to have a substantial fund-raising advantage over his eventual Republican rival, Mr. Burton said that in the early going, when outside groups are playing a particularly prominent role in laying out the arguments on both sides, conservatives have a big lead over their liberal counterparts.
''This is asymmetric warfare,'' he said, ''but we're pretty confident that we'll be more effective and more strategic in how we spend our money.''
Crossroads GPS, a conservative advocacy group founded by Mr. Rove and other Republican strategists, has placed the biggest bet so far on negative messages. By its own count, it has spent about $20 million this year on political advertising. Much of it was broadcast during the debt-ceiling debate this summer, when it singled out members of Congress with advertisements that portrayed Democrats and Mr. Obama as fiscally irresponsible and unable to fix the economy.
In recent weeks, the group has taken on Mr. Obama and his economic agenda, spending $2.6 million on a commercial that criticizes his support for an upper-income tax increase and suggests a split on the issue between Mr. Obama and former President Bill Clinton.
It ends with a nod to the Republican line of attack that Democrats are inciting class warfare: ''President Obama, it's time to attack problems, not people.''
Crossroads has been accused of not portraying Mr. Clinton's words accurately. While he did express doubt that raising taxes in a sluggish economy could be effective, he said he supported the general principle of higher taxes for the wealthy.
Many of the Crossroads advertisements have been running in swing states like Colorado, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania and have been timed to coincide with presidential trips.
''It creates a scenario where the president's visit is greeted with a strong counterpoint to the argument he's making,'' said Jonathan Collegio, communications director for Crossroads GPS.
''And in battleground states where the issue framing is going to impact 2012, it's critical to be making your point there early and often,'' Mr. Collegio said. ''There may be some value in advertising now that will be impossible to achieve toward the end of the campaign, when virtually all of the advertising on television and radio is political.''
Crossroads is hardly the only conservative group that is spending heavily on anti-Obama advertising, thanks in large part to court decisions that have allowed independent organizations to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. Americans for Prosperity, the organization founded with the backing of David H. and Charles G. Koch, is also playing a busy early role.
The Americans for Prosperity approach has been slightly different, portraying the Obama administration as not just fiscally imprudent but also corrupt. In its latest advertisement, a 60-second spot that has been running heavily in places across Florida, Michigan, Nevada and Virginia, an announcer repeatedly names Solyndra, the government-backed solar power company that went bankrupt and has become a focus of conservative anger over wasteful spending.
Then it suggests that Solyndra's political ties to Democrats played a role in its winning a government loan guarantee: ''Is this the change we're supposed to believe in? Tell President Obama you shouldn't use taxpayer dollars for political favors.''
An analysis from Kantar Media showed that in recent weeks Americans for Prosperity has already spent $2.4 million buying airtime for the advertisement, which has been broadcast nearly 4,000 times.

HEADLINE: When Did The Rules Change?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
The 2012 presidential election can be seen as offering a choice between two visions of how to return us to this country's golden age -- from roughly 1945 to around 1973 -- when working life was most secure for many Americans, particularly white, middle-class men. President Obama said his jobs plan was for people who believed ''if you worked hard and played by the rules, you would be rewarded.'' Mitt Romney explained his goal was to restore hope for ''folks who grew up believing that if they played by the rules . . . they would have the chance to build a good life.'' But these days, many workers have lost a near guarantee on a decent wage and benefits -- and their careers are likely to have much more volatility (great years; bad years; confusing, mediocre years) than their parents' ever did. So when did the rules change? 
It has been hard to keep track. Over the past four decades, we have experienced the oil embargo, Carter-era malaise and a few recessions. Mixed in were the thrills of the late 1990s and mid-aughts, when it seemed as if you were a sap if you weren't getting rich or at least trying. But these dramas prevented many of us from realizing that the economic logic was changing fundamentally. Starting in the 1970s, labor was upended by a lot more than just formal government work rules. Increased global trade devastated workers in many industries, especially textiles, apparel, toys, furniture and electronics assembly. Computers and other technological innovations had an arguably greater impact. While factories continue to make more stuff in the United States than ever before, employment in them has collapsed.
Computers have hurt workers outside factories too. Picture the advertising agency in ''Mad Men,'' and think about the abundance of people who were hired to do jobs that are now handled electronically by small machines. Countless secretaries were replaced by word processing, voice mail, e-mail and scheduling software; accounting staff by Excel; people in the art department by desktop design programs. This is also true of trades like plumbing and carpentry, in which new technologies replaced a bunch of people who most likely stood around helping measure things and making sure everything worked correctly.
As a result, the people whose jobs remained valuable in that ''Mad Men'' office were then freed up to do more valuable things. A talented art director could produce more work more quickly with InDesign. A bright accountant could spend more time thinking of new ways to make and save money, rather than spending endless hours punching numbers into an adding machine. Global trade works much the same way. It's horrible news for a textile factory worker in North Carolina, but it may be great for a fashion designer in New York.
A general guideline these days is that people are rewarded when they can do things that take trained judgment and skill -- things, in other words, that can't be done by computers or lower-wage workers in other countries. Money now flows around the world so quickly, and technology changes so fast, that people who thought they were in high demand find themselves uprooted. Many newspaper reporters have learned that their work was subsidized, in part, by classified ads and now can't survive the rise of Craigslist; computer programmers have found out that some smart young guys in India will do their jobs for much less. Meanwhile, China lends so much money to the United States that mortgage brokers and bond traders can become richer than they ever imagined for a few years and then, just as quickly, become broke and unemployed.
One of the greatest changes is that a college degree is no longer the guarantor of a middle-class existence. Until the early 1970s, less than 11 percent of the adult population graduated from college, and most of them could get a decent job. Today nearly a third have college degrees, and a higher percentage of them graduated from nonelite schools. A bachelor's degree on its own no longer conveys intelligence and capability. To get a good job, you have to have some special skill -- charm, by the way, counts -- that employers value. But there's also a pretty good chance that by some point in the next few years, your boss will find that some new technology or some worker overseas can replace you.
Though it's no guarantee, a B.A. or some kind of technical training is at least a prerequisite for a decent salary. It's hard to see any great future for high-school dropouts or high-school graduates with no technical skills. They most often get jobs that require little judgment and minimal training, like stocking shelves, cooking burgers and cleaning offices. Employers generally see these unskilled workers as commodities -- one is as good as any other -- and thus each worker has very little bargaining power, especially now that unions are weaker. There are about 40 million of these low-skilled people in our work force. They're vying for jobs that are likely to earn near the minimum wage with few or no benefits, and they have a high chance of being laid off many times in a career.
Global trade and technology are significant trends, but they're not laws and policies. The actual rules have also changed notably since the 1970s. Back then, there were all sorts of stabilizers that pushed working-class wages up and kept rich people's wages lower. The minimum wage, at its pre-1970s peak, was almost 50 percent higher than it is now (inflation adjusted, naturally). Unions were stronger and had more government support. The United States taxed the rich much higher relative to the working class. (The top bracket was taxed at 70 percent in 1978; now it's 35 percent.) It's hard to imagine, but regulations largely limited the profitability of banks and kept bankers' financial compensation low.
The new rules, combined with the other major changes, have effectively removed both the floor and the ceiling. It's easier for some to make a lot more money and for others to fall much further behind. That has meant a huge increase in inequality. The top 1 percent of families now makes 26 times the average of the other 99 percent (the ratio was 11 to 1 in 1979). The top 0.1 percent makes 130 times the bottom 99 (up from a 38-to-1 ratio 40 years ago). And the inequality is not just between classes. The average wages of the average American have stayed largely flat for decades, but those averages hide a lot of volatility, as more people find themselves at the extremes of wealth or poverty. A successful plumber who has mastered all the new water-flow sensor technology and pipe-fitting innovations (and is probably in a union) can make more than $100,000 a year, while other plumbers, who just know the basics, could make less than $20,000.
The increasingly vicious battle between left and right is, at the most basic level, a dispute over how to respond to these new rules. Republicans largely claim that the new rules will make the country richer and, in the long run, will be beneficial to everyone willing to put in the hard work. Few Democrats call for a return to record high taxes and trade barriers -- after all, the free flow of cheap goods has helped many, particularly the poor. But many do want a return to the spirit of the old rules, when the government sought to make life more equal, more stable and, for some, less rewarding. The rest of us, meanwhile, should go to school, learn some skills and prepare for a rocky road.

To the Sports Editor:
Re ''Workers Feeling Squeezed by the N.B.A. Lockout,'' Nov. 25: Now that the players and owners have ended their petulant schoolyard spat, it is indeed time to consider the thousands of workers who have been denied many weeks' pay because of the loss of a major portion of the season. 
Players and owners have an opportunity to show that they are aware of the people who make it possible for them to earn their billions. Let the players agree to have a portion of their otherworldly salaries deducted and distributed among as many support workers as can be identified. And let their agreement stand as a dare to the owners not to follow suit. Joe Claro

Impact of Abuse
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''For Victim 1, a Search for Trust,'' Nov. 23: The only real help for victims of sexual abuse is to be heard and supported by others in their community. They need to tell their stories, not be blamed for what happened, and be supported as they try to heal. It is not uncommon for them to feel they somehow caused the abuse to happen. The guilt and remorse they often feel can linger for years. Some victims never recover, and their lives are often destroyed.
The abusers need to take full responsibility for what they have done and be held accountable. For those who have stood by and done nothing to protect the victims involved, now is the time to step forward and learn how to recognize the signs of abuse so that it can be prevented.

Asset Analysis
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''Paterno Passes On Home to His Wife for $1,'' Nov. 16: Joe and Sue Paterno, as joint owners of the home in which they live, could not be forced to turn over the house as an asset unless they both were the subject of a lawsuit resulting in a judgment against them. In terms of shielding assets, Joe Paterno is neither better nor worse off now than he was before he sold the house to his wife. Mary Ann Hanna

Flight of Fancy
To the Sports Editor:
Re ''Season Tips Off in Location Unlike Any Other,'' Nov. 12: Given the dire condition of the economy and the level of unemployment in this country, it seems rather frivolous for Michigan State and North Carolina to be opening the college basketball season on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier docked in Southern California at a cost of $2 million. Though apparently taxpayer money was not involved, nothing was said about the source of the funding and one must wonder, with President Obama in attendance and addressing the crowd from center court before the game, whether the event had anything to do with his re-election campaign.

HEADLINE: 'Spreading the Wealth' in Democrats' Favor

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: It is a measure of the altered political environment heading into the 2012 presidential election that Democrats see a "spread-the-wealth" strategy as a winning line of attack. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Fighting from behind in the final days of the 2008 presidential election, Senator John McCain found a weapon in an unscripted encounter between his opponent, Senator Barack Obama, and a voter.
"When you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody," Mr. Obama told Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, better known as Joe the Plumber. Mr. McCain seized on the remark as evidence of Mr. Obama's adherence to "socialism."
In most respects, the 2012 Republican nominee will enjoy a more promising electoral landscape than Mr. McCain did. But would spread-the-wealth "socialism" be as inviting a target today? Maybe not.
Indeed, it is a measure of the altered political environment that Democrats now see the distribution of income as a weapon of their own.
"The whole battleground has changed," Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the top political strategist among Democrats in the chamber, said in an interview. "There's been a major shift in public opinion."

Mr. Schumer is, at least in part, making a case for accountability. In 2009 and 2010, Democrats shouldered the blame for voters' economic pain since they controlled the White House and Congress. Now they share it with a House Republican majority that is committed to government cutbacks.
But he is also talking about the consequences of Occupy Wall Street that linger after the removal of the tents from Zuccotti Park. By highlighting the widening disparity between top earners and everyone else, Mr. Schumer said, the movement has created an opening for Democrats even as the Obama-era economy remains weak.
"Jobs and income inequality are going to be the No. 1 issue" in 2012, he said. "Simply cutting government isn't going to work."
After Zuccotti Park
Mr. Schumer's argument carries a heavy burden of proof. So far, the most conspicuous piece of the Democrats' inequality agenda has flopped.
During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama argued for ending the so-called Bush tax cuts for individuals who make $200,000 or more and for couples who earn above $250,000.
But in 2009, as president, Mr. Obama did not seek to roll back the tax cuts, on the grounds that doing so might further weaken the economy. Last year, Democratic Congressional leaders could not muster the votes to end them. And after Republicans routed his party in the midterm elections, Mr. Obama agreed to extend the cuts - along with those for other taxpayers - for two more years.
But now, Mr. Schumer insisted, conditions are tilting in the Democrats' favor.
First, successive rounds of Tea Party-driven budget cuts this year have clarified this tradeoff: unless taxes go up on the wealthy, Medicare and Social Security must be cut drastically.
Second, Occupy Wall Street drew attention to the extent to which income has shifted in favor of the wealthy over the past three decades.
"The Republican/Tea Party narrative about the economy has been superseded by a different narrative - one that emphasizes the growing gap between those at the very top of the economic ladder and the rest of the country," Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who advises Mr. Schumer, wrote in a memorandum last week.
Third, Mr. Schumer prevailed in his argument with White House officials that Democrats should focus on taxing million-dollar incomes. That makes it harder for Republicans to persuade middle-income voters that their taxes would rise, too (while also conveniently sparing many upper-middle-class New Yorkers).
Still, Mr. Obama's approval ratings remain weak, and Democrats have not proved that they can harness the sort of political energy Republicans reaped from the Tea Party in 2010.
"That is our challenge," Mr. Schumer said.
G.O.P. Takes Note
David Winston, a pollster who advises House Republicans, respects Mr. Schumer's acumen. He credits Mr. Schumer for being earlier than most to spot Republicans' vulnerability during the Bush administration over stagnant middle-class incomes.
And he acknowledges that hard times heighten concerns about income disparities in the American tug of war between policies that enhance individual opportunity and those that equalize outcomes.
But the weakness in Mr. Schumer's analysis, Mr. Winston said, is that Democrats have not persuaded voters of their plans for generating economic growth as opposed to curbing income inequality.
There are signs of Republican caution about the income gap just the same. Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, generally considered the party's most likely presidential nominee next year, has focused his proposed capital gains tax cut on people who earn under $200,000, in the name of helping those facing the greatest economic squeeze.
This week, Senate Democrats intend to pressure Republicans with a vote on financing Mr. Obama's proposed payroll tax cuts using a surtax on million-dollar incomes. They plan similar votes later for infrastructure and energy programs.
Their reward for persistence, Mr. Schumer said, will be job-creating legislation, political traction or both.
"You can't do it with just one vote," he said. "We're going to keep at it through the winter and spring."

HEADLINE: The Future of the Obama Coalition

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: If the Democrats concede a majority of the white working class vote, what have they got left? 

 BODY:
For decades, Democrats have suffered continuous and increasingly severe losses among white voters. But preparations by Democratic operatives for the 2012 election make it clear for the first time that the party will explicitly abandon the white working class.
All pretense of trying to win a majority of the white working class has been effectively jettisoned in favor of cementing a center-left coalition made up, on the one hand, of voters who have gotten ahead on the basis of educational attainment - professors, artists, designers, editors, human resources managers, lawyers, librarians, social workers, teachers and therapists - and a second, substantial constituency of lower-income voters who are disproportionately African-American and Hispanic.
It is instructive to trace the evolution of a political strategy based on securing this coalition in the writings and comments, over time, of such Democratic analysts as Stanley Greenberg and Ruy Teixeira. Both men were initially determined to win back the white working-class majority, but both currently advocate a revised Democratic alliance in which whites without college degrees are effectively replaced by well-educated socially liberal whites in alliance with the growing ranks of less affluent minority voters, especially Hispanics.
The 2012 approach treats white voters without college degrees as an unattainable cohort. The Democratic goal with these voters is to keep Republican winning margins to manageable levels, in the 12 to 15 percent range, as opposed to the 30-point margin of 2010 - a level at which even solid wins among minorities and other constituencies are not enough to produce Democratic victories.
"It's certainly true that if you compare how things were in the early '90s to the way they are now, there has been a significant shift in the role of the working class. You see it across all advanced industrial countries," Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in an interview.
In the United States, Teixeira noted, "the Republican Party has become the party of the white working class," while in Europe, many working-class voters who had been the core of Social Democratic parties have moved over to far right parties, especially those with anti-immigration platforms.
Teixeira, writing with John Halpin, argues in "The Path to 270: Demographics versus Economics in the 2012 Presidential Election," that in order to be re-elected, President Obama must keep his losses among white college graduates to the 4-point margin of 2008 (47-51). Why? Otherwise he will not be able to survive a repetition of 2010, when white working-class voters supported Republican House candidates by a record-setting margin of 63-33.
Obama's alternative path to victory, according to Teixeira and Halpin, would be to keep his losses among all white voters at the same level John Kerry did in 2004, when he lost them by 17 points, 58-41. This would be a step backwards for Obama, who lost among all whites in 2008 by only 12 points (55-43). Obama can afford to drop to Kerry's white margins because, between 2008 and 2012, the pro-Democratic minority share of the electorate is expected to grow by two percentage points and the white share to decline by the same amount, reflecting the changing composition of the national electorate.
The following passage from "The Path to 270" illustrates the degree to which whites without college degrees are currently cast as irrevocably lost to the Republican Party. "Heading into 2012," Teixeira and Halpin write, one of the primary strategic questions will be:
Will the president hold sufficient support among communities of color, educated whites, Millennials, single women, and seculars and avoid a catastrophic meltdown among white working-class voters? 
For his part, Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and strategist and a key adviser to Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, wrote a memorandum earlier this month, together with James Carville, that makes no mention of the white working class. "Seizing the New Progressive Common Ground" describes instead a "new progressive coalition" made up of "young people, Hispanics, unmarried women, and affluent suburbanites."
In an interview, Greenberg, speaking of white working class voters, said that in the period from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, "we battled to get them back. They were sizable in number and central to the base of the Democratic Party." At the time, he added, "we didn't know that we would never get them back, that they were alienated and dislodged."
In his work exploring how to build a viable progressive coalition, Greenberg noted, he has become "much more interested in the affluent suburban voters than the former Reagan Democrats." At the same time, however, he argues that Republican winning margins among white working-class voters are highly volatile and that Democrats have to push hard to minimize losses, which will not be easy. "Right now," he cautioned, "I don't see any signs they are moveable."
Teixeira's current analysis stands in sharp contrast to an article that he wrote with Joel Rogers, which appeared in the American Prospect in 1995. In "Who Deserted the Democrats in 1994?," Teixeira and Rogers warned that between 1992 and 1994 support for Democratic House candidates had fallen by 20 points, from 57 to 37 percent among high-school-educated white men; by 15 points among white men with some college; and by 10 points among white women in both categories. A failure to reverse those numbers, Teixeira warned, would "doom Clinton's re-election bid" in 1996.
Teixeira was by no means alone in his 1995 assessment; he was in agreement with orthodox Democratic thinking of the time. In a 1995 memo to President Clinton, Greenberg wrote that whites without college degrees were "the principal obstacle" to Clinton's re-election and that they needed to be brought back into the fold.
In practice, or perhaps out of necessity, the Democratic Party in 2006 and 2008 chose the upscale white-downscale minority approach that proved highly successful twice, but failed miserably in 2010, and appears to have a 50-50 chance in 2012.
The outline of this strategy for 2012 was captured by Times reporters Jackie Calmes and Mark Landler a few months ago in an article tellingly titled, "Obama Charts a New Route to Re-election." Calmes and Landler describe how Obama's re-election campaign plans to deal with the decline in white working class support in Rust Belt states by concentrating on states with high percentages of college educated voters, including Colorado, Virginia and New Hampshire.
There are plenty of critics of the tactical idea of dispensing with low-income whites, both among elected officials and party strategists. But Cliff Zukin, a professor of political science at Rutgers, puts the situation plainly. "My sense is that if the Democrats stopped fishing there, it is because there are no fish."
As a practical matter, the Obama campaign and, for the present, the Democratic Party, have laid to rest all consideration of reviving the coalition nurtured and cultivated by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The New Deal Coalition - which included unions, city machines, blue-collar workers, farmers, blacks, people on relief, and generally non-affluent progressive intellectuals - had the advantage of economic coherence. It received support across the board from voters of all races and religions in the bottom half of the income distribution, the very coherence the current Democratic coalition lacks. 
A top priority of the less affluent wing of today's left alliance is the strengthening of the safety net, including health care, food stamps, infant nutrition and unemployment compensation. These voters generally take the brunt of recessions and are most in need of government assistance to survive. According to recent data from the Department of Agriculture, 45.8 million people, nearly 15 percent of the population, depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to meet their needs for food.
The better-off wing, in contrast, puts at the top of its political agenda a cluster of rights related to self-expression, the environment, demilitarization, and, importantly, freedom from repressive norms - governing both sexual behavior and women's role in society - that are promoted by the conservative movement.
While demographic trends suggest the continued growth of pro-Democratic constituencies and the continued decline of core Republican voters, particularly married white Christians, there is no guarantee that demography is destiny.
The political repercussions of gathering minority strength remain unknown. Calculations based on exit poll and Census data suggest that the Democratic Party will become "majority minority" shortly after 2020.
One outcome could be a stronger party of the left in national and local elections. An alternate outcome could be exacerbated intra-party conflict between whites, blacks and Hispanics - populations frequently marked by diverging material interests. Black versus brown struggles are already emerging in contests over the distribution of political power, especially during a current redistricting of city council, state legislative and congressional seats in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago.
Republican Party operatives are acutely sensitive to such tensions, hoping for opportunities to fracture the Democratic coalition, virtually assuring that neither party can safely rely on a secure path to victory over time.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths GOLD, HERBERT Z

 BODY:
GOLD--Herbert Z. (1915-2011), adoring husband and father, and mensch to all who knew him, died in the early morning after Thanksgiving at the age of 96. Born in Brooklyn, Herb, graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, where he played piccolo in the marching band, and then from NYU Law School. He later joined his father's business building homes and apartment buildings in Rockville Centre and Hewlett Harbor. He was appointed redeveloper as a partner of the firm of Stackler, Frank and Gold to build and complete the Urban Renewal Program for the Village of Rockville Centre, New York, and other projects on Long Island. 
In 1941 he met Rita Weinstein and when he asked which street he should take to drive her home, she told him to take the long way, and they did: He was married to Rita for 67 years before her passing in 2008. Together, they raised their beautiful son Richard, who sadly passed at the age of 35. Herb was a generous benefactor to countless organizations and individuals throughout the world. He established the Rita Gold Early Childhood Centers at Columbia University's Teachers College and in Tel Aviv. Herb funded many scholarships for young Opera singers, as well as for underprivileged students making it possible for them to go on to higher education. He was also a generous donor to The New York City Opera, Julliard, and The Sarasota Opera. Herb lived life to the fullest, inspiring those around him to strive to fulfill their highest potential. He was a kind, soft-spoken man of keen intellect and quick wit. Herb was a philanthropist and active participant in Jewish causes in the US and Israel, and a caring and generous friend to so many. He has left all of us an extraordinary legacy of learning and commitment to service. He will always be in our hearts. He is survived by his brother Ronny and loving cousins in America and Israel. Services will be held graveside on Monday, 12 noon, at The Old Montifiore Cemetery, located off Springfield Blvd. in St. Albans, Queens, New York. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the charity of your choice.

HEADLINE: Time Runs Short for Europe to Find a Solution to Its Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Eighteen months into a sovereign debt crisis -- and after many futile efforts to resolve it -- the endgame appears to be fast approaching for Europe.
While its leaders may well hold to the current path of offering piecemeal solutions, nervous investors are fleeing European countries and banks.
Two main options exist: either the euro zone splits apart or it binds closer together.
Each of these paths -- Greece, and possibly others, dropping the euro or the emergence of a deeper political union in which a federal Europe takes control of national budgets -- would lead to serious political, legal and financial consequences. 
But with financial panic now threatening to move beyond Italy and Spain to Belgium, France and Germany, the euro zone's paymaster, the pressure to arrive at a solution is at a new level of intensity.
In Britain, even the satirical weekly Private Eye has weighed in, proposing last week that the answer was for Europe itself to leave the European Union.
Underlying these possible outcomes has been Europe's persistent inability to address the central weakness of its common currency project: how to get money from the few countries that have it, mainly Germany and the Netherlands, to the many that need it -- Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and perhaps even France.
In recent days, euro zone leaders have been pursuing a deal that would institute strict new budget rules while avoiding the need to rewrite existing treaties.
The consequences of continued inaction are dire. Uncertainty and austerity have decimated the euro zone's growth prospects, and analysts now expect the region's economy to shrink 0.2 percent next year -- a blow for the many American companies that export there.
American financial institutions are also at risk. According to the Institute of International Finance, they have $767 billion worth of exposure through bonds, credit derivatives and other guarantees to private and public sector borrowers in the euro zone's weakest economies.
With the European Central Bank continuing to refuse to print money as its counterparts in the United States and Britain have done, investors now foresee a much greater likelihood of a broad market crash and a worldwide recession.
Such anxieties were on display last week when Vitor Constancio, the vice president of the central bank, gave a speech to investors in London.
It was billed as an address on the international monetary system, but given the circumstances, there was little interest among investors in Mr. Constancio's views regarding fixed versus floating-exchange rates and quite a lot about what steps the central bank might take to address the crisis.
One somewhat frantic investment banker noted that beyond the Italians and the Spanish, even the Germans were having problems selling their bonds. What, he asked, was the European Central Bank going to do about it?
Mr. Constancio mentioned the central bank's bond buying program and making loans available to banks, but he was blunt in saying that unless countries like Greece and Italy followed treaty rules and reduced their budget deficits, there was not much the central bank could do.
''The countries must deliver,'' said Mr. Constancio, a former governor of the Portuguese central bank. ''In the end, it is governments that are responsible for the euro area -- it is not just the E.C.B.''
It is this eat-your-spinach policy approach, however, that many analysts now say is making the situation worse as countries throughout the euro area -- including Germany, the region's economic locomotive -- cut spending and raise taxes to meet budget deficit targets.
In a recent paper, Simon Tilford, an economist at the Center for European Reform in London, argues that imposing additional rules rather than creating a federal framework to allow the euro zone to commonly transfer or borrow money -- as can be done in the United States -- will end in disaster.
''The solution to the problem has become the problem itself,'' he said. ''And investors see this: you cannot just keep cutting spending in the teeth of a recession.''
Bernard Connolly, a persistent critic of Europe, estimates it would cost Germany, as the main surplus-generating country in the euro area, about 7 percent of its annual gross domestic product over several years to transfer sufficient funds to bail out Europe's debt-burdened countries, including France.
That amount, he has argued, would far surpass the huge reparations bill foisted upon Germany by the victorious powers after World War I, the final payment of which Germany made in 2010.
Analysts say it is the unbending attitude of Germany, Europe's richest country, that it not become responsible for the debts of weaker economies that has so far stymied progress on the widely supported idea of a euro area able to issue its own bonds.
Lack of movement on a federal Europe has pushed investors to consider what would happen if a country like Greece exited the euro zone. Analysts predict dire consequences for the departing country, ranging from default to a collapse of its banking system.
A recent report by UBS estimated that in the first year, the citizens of the exiting nation would face costs of as much as 11,000 euros a person on top of the austerity-induced pain already incurred.
Such a move might be legally impossible: there is no provision in any European treaty for a country to leave or be expelled from the euro zone -- a conscious choice by the framers of the project.
But if a country made such a decision, it would have to leave the 27-member European Union as well, thus entering a more profound state of exile.
A view is now taking hold among many European leaders that the ever-worsening crisis may result in Brussels being given direct control over the budgets of countries that continue to run excessive deficits -- a proposal made recently by the euro's most passionate advocate, Jean-Claude Trichet, former president of the European Central Bank.
''The will to make this thing work is stronger than you might think,'' said Larry Hatheway, an economist at UBS and one of the authors of the report on the cost of one or more countries leaving the euro zone.
In this vein, several economists at Bruegel, a research institute in Brussels, are calling for a euro zone finance minister, elected by the European Parliament, who would have limited federal powers to raise revenue.
With time short, pressure is building on the European Central Bank to defy German objections and buy more distressed government bonds, but there is little indication the bank has decided to do so.
Last week, Mr. Constancio actually appeared to boast about the bank's restraint thus far, explaining to harried investors that the central bank's bond-buying effort represented about 2 percent of euro area G.D.P. That compares with an intervention of 11 percent of G.D.P. by the Federal Reserve in the United States and 13 percent by the Bank of England.
''We are not financing the deficits of countries,'' he said.

Merck Consumer Care, a unit of Merck & Company, chose Publicis Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, to handle three creative assignments with combined spending estimated at close to $50 million. The assignments Publicis will handle are for Miralax in the United States, which had been handled by Merkley & Partners, New York, part of the Omnicom Group; the Dr. Scholl brand in Latin America, which is, according to the company, essentially a new assignment; and a prospective new product in the United States that adweek.comdescribed as an incontinence product for women. Publicis Worldwide joins Euro RSCG Worldwide, a division of Havas, on the global Merck Consumer Care agency roster. 
BBDO New York was awarded two large assignments. One is from the New York State agency known as the Empire State Development Corporation, which sought an agency to work on campaigns that carry the theme ''New York open for business'' and support the state's business development efforts. Spending could be as much as $50 million over a two-year period. A contract includes an option for two additional one-year renewals.
BBDO New York was also hired by Foot Locker Inc., New York, to create campaigns for three brands in the United States: Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker. The assignment, with spending estimated at more than $13 million, includes ads for Foot Locker for the current Christmas shopping season and ads to run next year for all three brands. The assignment had previously been handled by SapientNitro, New York, part of Sapient. BBDO New York is part of the BBDO North America division of BBDO Worldwide, which is owned by the Omnicom Group.
GNC Holdings, Pittsburgh, chose McKinney, Durham, N.C., as its creative agency. The assignment, with spending estimated at $50 million to $60 million, had been handled by the Arnell Group, New York, part of the Omnicom Group, which did not take part in a review. A new campaign is expected early next year, said Jeff Hennion, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at GNC.

Miscellany
National spot radio sales are expected to increase 3.1 percent this year compared with 2010, according to the National Spot Radio Market Update from the Katz Radio Group, part of Clear Channel Communications. There was a slowdown in the fourth quarter, the report said, echoing reports from other media that show some softening in demand for commercial time or ad space. However, 2012 is off to ''a positive start,'' according to the report, with ''solid demand from national advertisers'' and percentage increases in the single digits for the first two months.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
8 P.M. (Ovation) FRIDA (2002) Julie Taymor directed this film about the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo: her life, work, politics and pain, both psychological and physical. The movie was nominated for six Academy Awards and won for makeup and original score. Salma Hayek, below, nominated for best actress for her portrayal of Kahlo, has said she pursued the role for eight years. Alfred Molina channels Kahlo's husband, Diego Rivera. ''Ms. Taymor's film, adapted by no fewer than four screenwriters from Hayden Herrera's biography, is as restless and determined as its subject, whose painful, promiscuous life has become, almost 50 years after her death, something of a pop-culture legend,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But while Kahlo, at least in the account favored by Ms. Herrera and Ms. Taymor, refused to be constrained by her sex, social convention or disability, 'Frida' is corseted by the norms of high-toned, responsible filmmaking, ticking off important events in Kahlo's life without much insight or feeling.'' But, he added, ''when the movie manages to break free -- in bursts of color, imagination, music, sex and over-the-top theatricality -- it honors the artist's brave, anarchic spirit.'' 
10:30 A.M. (Oxygen)I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY (2007) Chuck (Adam Sandler) and Larry (Kevin James) are heterosexual New York City firefighters who pose as gay partners for insurance purposes. Jessica Biel plays Alex, the object of Chuck's affection -- if only he could tell her he prefers girls.
8 P.M. (CW)GOSSIP GIRL The family of CeCe (Cynthia Watros) gathers for a Studio 54 party given in her honor. Nate (Chace Crawford) assumes a larger role at The Spectator but finds his first major article hitting a bit too close to home. In ''Hart of Dixie,'' at 9, Zoe (Rachel Bilson) longs to return to New York for Thanksgiving but must meet her quota or lose her medical practice.
8 P.M. TOP GEAR Andy Wilman counts down the Top 40 highlights from the series's history in back-to-back episodes. Favorite moments from the 2005-6 season follow at 10.
9 P.M. (HBO) BORED TO DEATH The season ends as George (Ted Danson) hosts a wedding for Emily (Halley Feiffer) and Bernard (David Rasche). Jonathan (Jason Schwartzman) is hesitant to end things with his new girlfriend. And then he is taken hostage. In ''Enlightened,'' at 9:30, the relationship between Amy (Laura Dern) and Dougie (Timm Sharp) reaches a boiling point that draws the attention of the human resources department. Amy, meanwhile, tries to set up a meeting with Damon (Charles Esten).
9 P.M. (TNT) THE CLOSER Season 7 resumes as Brenda (Kyra Sedgwick, above, with other cast members) and her squad investigate the shooting of a principal whose high school is embroiled in scandal. But a conflict arises with Fritz (Jon Tenney) when Brenda's case encroaches on the territory of one being overseen by the F.B.I. At 10, Season 2 of ''Rizzoli & Isles'' picks up as Jane (Angie Harmon) and Maura (Sasha Alexander) delve into the shooting of a community activist, which incites the on-air disapproval of Bill O'Reilly (playing himself) of Fox News Channel for the way the police have handled the case.
9 P.M. (Fox) HOUSE A prosecutor collapses in court, and the team members make a diagnosis of hyperanxieity. Then they investigate his home. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) suspects that House (Hugh Laurie) is also hiding something at home.
9 P.M. (Travel) THE LAYOVER Anthony Bourdain suggests the best ways to spend 24 hours in New York City, his hometown. Stops include the Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridien hotel, the city's Shake Shacks and his favorite place for date night, Takashi in the West Village. For dessert he picks up a cone at the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck in Union Square.
10 P.M. (Food Network) DINERS, DRIVE-INS & DIVES Season 13 opens as Guy Fieri samples fried oyster po' boys and seafood chowder from a food truck in Vancouver, brisket paninis in Detroit and porchetta sandwiches in Chicago.
10 P.M. (NBC) ROCK CENTER WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS Kate Snow reports on the impact of a weak economy on newly impoverished Americans who must rely on government food assistance. Harry Smith looks at a cheating scandal. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Things to Tax

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The supercommittee was a superdud -- and we should be glad. Nonetheless, at some point we'll have to rein in budget deficits. And when we do, here's a thought: How about making increased revenue an important part of the deal?
And I don't just mean a return to Clinton-era tax rates. Why should 1990s taxes be considered the outer limit of revenue collection? Think about it: The long-run budget outlook has darkened, which means that some hard choices must be made. Why should those choices only involve spending cuts? Why not also push some taxes above their levels in the 1990s? 
Let me suggest two areas in which it would make a lot of sense to raise taxes in earnest, not just return them to pre-Bush levels: taxes on very high incomes and taxes on financial transactions.
About those high incomes: In my last column I suggested that the very rich, who have had huge income gains over the last 30 years, should pay more in taxes. I got many responses from readers, with a common theme being that this was silly, that even confiscatory taxes on the wealthy couldn't possibly raise enough money to matter.
Folks, you're living in the past. Once upon a time America was a middle-class nation, in which the super-elite's income was no big deal. But that was another country.
The I.R.S. reports that in 2007, that is, before the economic crisis, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- roughly speaking, people with annual incomes over $2 million -- had a combined income of more than a trillion dollars. That's a lot of money, and it wouldn't be hard to devise taxes that would raise a significant amount of revenue from those super-high-income individuals.
For example, a recent report by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center points out that before 1980 very-high-income individuals fell into tax brackets well above the 35 percent top rate that applies today. According to the center's analysis, restoring those high-income brackets would have raised $78 billion in 2007, or more than half a percent of G.D.P. I've extrapolated that number using Congressional Budget Office projections, and what I get for the next decade is that high-income taxation could shave more than $1 trillion off the deficit.
It's instructive to compare that estimate with the savings from the kinds of proposals that are actually circulating in Washington these days. Consider, for example, proposals to raise the age of Medicare eligibility to 67, dealing a major blow to millions of Americans. How much money would that save?
Well, none from the point of view of the nation as a whole, since we would be pushing seniors out of Medicare and into private insurance, which has substantially higher costs. True, it would reduce federal spending -- but not by much. The budget office estimates that outlays would fall by only $125 billion over the next decade, as the age increase phased in. And even when fully phased in, this partial dismantling of Medicare would reduce the deficit only about a third as much as could be achieved with higher taxes on the very rich.
So raising taxes on the very rich could make a serious contribution to deficit reduction. Don't believe anyone who claims otherwise.
And then there's the idea of taxing financial transactions, which have exploded in recent decades. The economic value of all this trading is dubious at best. In fact, there's considerable evidence suggesting that too much trading is going on. Still, nobody is proposing a punitive tax. On the table, instead, are proposals like the one recently made by Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Peter DeFazio for a tiny fee on financial transactions.
And here's the thing: Because there are so many transactions, such a fee could yield several hundred billion dollars in revenue over the next decade. Again, this compares favorably with the savings from many of the harsh spending cuts being proposed in the name of fiscal responsibility.
But wouldn't such a tax hurt economic growth? As I said, the evidence suggests not -- if anything, it suggests that to the extent that taxing financial transactions reduces the volume of wheeling and dealing, that would be a good thing.
And it's instructive, too, to note that some countries already have financial transactions taxes -- and that among those who do are Hong Kong and Singapore. If some conservative starts claiming that such taxes are an unwarranted government intrusion, you might want to ask him why such taxes are imposed by the two countries that score highest on the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.
Now, the tax ideas I've just mentioned wouldn't be enough, by themselves, to fix our deficit. But the same is true of proposals for spending cuts. The point I'm making here isn't that taxes are all we need; it is that they could and should be a significant part of the solution.

HEADLINE: The Price of Intolerance

 BODY:
It's early yet for a full accounting of the economic damage Alabama has done to itself with its radical new immigration law.
Farmers can tally the cost of crops left to rot as workers flee. Governments can calculate the loss of revenues when taxpayers flee. It's harder to measure the price of a ruined business reputation or the value of investments lost or productivity lost as Alabamians stand in line for hours to prove their citizenship in any transaction with the government. Or what the state will ultimately spend fighting off an onslaught of lawsuits, or training and deploying police officers in the widening immigrant dragnet, or paying the cost of diverting scarce resources away from fighting real crimes.
A growing number of Alabamians say the price will be too high, and there is compelling evidence that they are right. Alabama is already at the low end of states in employment and economic vitality. It has long struggled to lure good jobs and shed a history of racial intolerance. 
That was turning around and many foreign manufacturers, including Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Honda, have set up there. Its business-friendly reputation took a serious blow with the arrest in Tuscaloosa of a visiting Mercedes manager who was caught driving without his license and taken to jail as a potential illegal immigrant.
Sheldon Day, the mayor of Thomasville, has aggressively recruited foreign companies to his town, including a Chinese company -- Golden Dragon Precise Copper Tube Group -- that plans to build a $100 million plant there, with more than 300 jobs.
Mayor Day is now worried about that project and future prospects. He was quoted by The Press-Register in Mobile as saying business inquiries had dried up since the law was passed. ''I know the immigration issue is being used against us.''
Alabama's competitors certainly won't waste any time. After the Tuscaloosa incident, the editorial page of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch invited Mercedes to Missouri. ''We are the Show-Me State,'' it said, ''not the 'Show me your papers' state.''
Undocumented immigrants make up about 4.2 percent of Alabama's work force, or 95,000 people in a state of 4.8 million. For all of the talk about clearing the way for unemployed Americans, there is no evidence that Alabamians in any significant numbers are rushing to fill the gap left by missing farm laborers and other low-wage immigrant workers.
The loss of job-filling, tax-paying workers may get even worse if Alabama is allowed to enforce a law requiring people who own or rent a trailer home to obtain an annual registration sticker. This puts the undocumented in a Catch-22 -- criminals if they don't have a sticker, criminals if they try to get one. For now, a judge has issued an order blocking enforcement. But if the state wins, many thousands may simply join the exodus, tearing more shreds in the economy.
The law's damage is particularly heartbreaking in poor towns across the state, where small businesses are the economic lifeblood. We've spoken with Latino shopkeepers and restaurant owners in places like Albertville who say business is catastrophically down, with customers in hiding or flight. The situation isn't much better in Huntsville and Birmingham.
There should be no doubt about the moral repugnance of Alabama's law, which seeks to deny hardworking families the means to live. But even some of the law's most enthusiastic supporters are beginning to acknowledge the law's high economic cost. There is growing talk of revising or repealing the legislation. The sooner Alabama does so -- and other states learn -- the better.

HEADLINE: The Branding Of the Occupy Movement

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Kalle Lasn, the longtime editor of the anticonsumerist magazine Adbusters, did not invent the anger that has been feeding the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations across the United States.
But he did brand it.
Last summer, as uprisings shook the Middle East and much of the world economy struggled, Mr. Lasn and several colleagues at the small magazine felt the moment was ripe to tap simmering frustration on the American political left.
On July 13, he and his colleagues created a new hash tag on Twitter: #OCCUPYWALLSTREET. They made a poster showing a ballerina dancing on the back of the muscular sculptured bull near Wall Street in Manhattan.
For some people they were just words and images. For Mr. Lasn, they were tools to begin remodeling the ''mental environment,'' to create a new ''meme,'' the term coined by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins for a kind of transcendent cultural message. 
''There's a number of ways to wage a meme war,'' Mr. Lasn, whose name is pronounced KAL-luh LAS-en, said in an interview. ''I believe that one of the most powerful things of all is aesthetics.''
Mr. Lasn, who helped found Adbusters in 1989, had spent much of his career skewering corporate America, creating ''subvertising'' campaigns like ''Joe Chemo,'' which deftly mocked the Joe Camel cigarette ads of the 1990s.
But the spread of the Occupy protests signals a substantial step up for the magazine and Mr. Lasn, who is 69. The protests, he hopes, will ''somehow change the power balance and make the world into a much more grass-roots, bottom-up kind of a place rather than the top-down Wall Street mega-corporate-driven system we now have.''
''This,'' he added, ''is the kind of dream many Occupiers have.''
Mr. Lasn was born in Estonia but his family fled near the end of World War II, when he was 2. His family lived in refugee camps in Europe before moving to Australia. He worked for several years for the Australian defense department, before moving to Japan and shifting to advertising.
By the 1970s, he had landed in Vancouver, disenchanted with what he felt was the moral detachment of the advertising industry. After working as a documentary filmmaker -- and butting heads with the Canadian government and media over logging practices in old-growth forests -- he founded Adbusters in 1989.
The magazine, which is owned by the nonprofit Adbusters Media Foundation, is published out of the basement of a house south of downtown and claims a circulation of about 70,000, mostly from newsstand sales outside of Canada. It has had prominent writers, among them Christopher Hedges and Bill McKibben.
But with its vivid artwork and photography, snippets of poetry and glossy fake ads with slogans like ''Everything is fine, keep shopping,'' Adbusters feels less like a manifesto than an evocative brochure, for $8.95 an issue.
''It's an art object,'' said Deborah Campbell, a former associate editor. ''When you look at art it speaks to you in different ways, and some of it is intellectual and some of it is provocative and some of it is a sense or a feeling.''
Before Occupy Wall Street, Adbusters had many smaller campaigns, including ''Buy Nothing Day.'' For years it has sold Blackspot shoes, made in an ''antisweatshop' facility in Pakistan. Mr. Lasn has written books, including ''Culture Jam: How to Reverse America's Suicidal Consumer Binge -- and Why We Must.''
It has struck some people as strange that a Canadian magazine helped start the Occupy movement, but Adbusters is only based in Canada, not focused on it.
''Everybody knows it's here but it's not a local magazine,'' said David Beers, the editor of The Tyee, an online news Web site based here. ''He isn't a local figure. It's not like he's on the morning radio. You never hear about the guy unless he's in a fight with someone.''
Mr. Lasn has a lot of fights. The attention brought by the Occupy protests has revived questions about his views on Jews and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 2004, Adbusters published an article claiming that a large percentage of neoconservatives behind American foreign policy were Jewish.
As a result, Mr. Lasn was called anti-Semitic, a charge he denies. He remains incensed that the incident was mentioned in a recent column by David Brooks, a New York Times columnist, and he has been involved in a discussion with the paper's letters page about how he can address it.
''There's not an anti-Semitic bone in my body,'' he said, adding, ''If we're going to start wars based on the power of neocons' influence in foreign policy, I think people should know who they are.''
He has also been accused of playing off the image-oriented culture that dominates advertising, instead of rejecting it outright. But Mr. Lasn said he believed in the power of media to subvert traditional power structures.
''If you're able to come up with a very sexy sounding hash tag like we did for Occupy Wall Street, and you come up with a very magical looking poster that seems to have something very profound about it, these devices push these memes, these meta memes, into the public imagination in a very powerful way,'' he said.
Some critics contend that Mr. Lasn believes his work is more influential than it is.
''There's nothing wrong with making fun of ads, but it's not revolutionary,'' said Joseph Heath, a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto, who wrote critically of Adbusters in a 2004 book, ''Nation of Rebels.'' ''I don't think that has revolutionary political implications, whereas Adbusters thinks it has revolutionary implications.''
''If you want to do politics,'' Professor Heath added, ''you have to do good old-fashioned politics.''
Now, surprisingly, Professor Heath said Adbusters is actually doing politics.
''This is all a positive development, in that Adbusters is doing more of what it should be doing,'' he said. ''They're doing something that has obvious political value.''
Not everyone is certain of that. Besides the right to pitch their tents in public parks for as long as they wish, some people ask, precisely what do the protesters want? An early version of the poster with the bull and the ballerina even asks the question: ''What is our one demand?''
Mr. Lasn has long believed that Wall Street and vast corporate wealth have sent the United States into what he calls ''terminal decline.'' But unlike many people involved in the protests, he also has specific goals he would like to see reached. He wants to see, among other things, ''a Robin Hood tax'' on all financial transactions, a restoration of the Glass-Steagall Act that erected barriers between banking and investing, a ban on certain types of high-frequency trading and the overturning of the Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case.
Mr. Lasn said that he and Micah White, a senior editor who helped start Occupy Wall Street, are in regular contact with some prominent protesters but insists they have no interest in a continuing leadership role, nor is it their job to speak for the movement, even if Adbusters would like some credit for starting it.
''This is what Adbusters has done for the past 20 years, to come up with these memes and to propagate them,'' he said. ''That's what it's all about: may the best memes win.''

HEADLINE: At Meeting on Climate Change, Urgent Issues but Low Expectations

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With intensifying climate disasters and global economic turmoil as the backdrop, delegates from 194 nations will gather in Durban, South Africa, starting Monday to try to advance, if only incrementally, the world's response to dangerous climate change.
To those who have followed the negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change over their nearly 20-year history, the conflicts and controversies to be taken up in Durban are monotonously familiar: the differing obligations of industrialized and developing nations, the question of who will pay to help poor nations adapt, the urgency of protecting tropical forests, the need to rapidly develop and deploy clean energy technology. 
The negotiating process itself is under fire from some quarters, including the poorest nations who believe their needs are being neglected in the fight among the major economic powers. Criticism is also coming from a relatively small but vocal band of climate-change skeptics, many of them sitting members of the United States Congress, who doubt the existence of human influence on the climate and ridicule international efforts to deal with it.
But scientists warn that this squabbling serves only to delay actions that must be taken to reduce climate-altering emissions and to improve vulnerable nations' ability to respond to the changes they say are surely coming.
''I feel we are losing completely the scientific rationale for action,'' said Rajendra K. Pachauri, director of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of scientists and statisticians that provides the technical underpinning of the United Nations talks. He noted that the group had recently released a detailed assessment of the increasing frequency of extreme climate events like droughts, floods and cyclones, and of the necessity of moving quickly to take steps to reduce emissions and adapt to the inevitable damage.
''All of these indicate that inaction in dealing with climate change and delays would only expose human society and all living species to risk that could become serious,'' Dr. Pachauri wrote in an e-mail. He said he was afraid the conference would ''only focus on short-term political considerations.''
The Durban meeting is formally known as COP17, for the 17th conference of the parties to the United Nations convention on climate change.
Delegates in Durban will be addressing relatively small and, to many, arcane questions of process and finance. Negotiators, having entered the United Nations climate talks at Copenhagen two years ago with grand ambitions and having left with disillusion, are now defining expectations down and hoping to keep the process alive through modest steps.
Last year in Cancun, Mexico, delegates produced an agreement that set up a fund to help poor countries adapt to climate changes, created mechanisms for the transfer of clean-energy technology, provided compensation for the preservation of tropical forests and enshrined the emissions reductions promises that came out of the Copenhagen meeting.
Negotiators postponed until Durban the politically freighted question of whether to extend the frayed Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement that requires most wealthy nations to trim their emissions while providing help to developing countries to pursue a cleaner energy path. Also still on the agenda are the structure of, and the sources of financing for, a climate adaptation and technology fund that is supposed to reach $100 billion a year by 2020.
One of the issues that is most contentious and least likely to be resolved involves the future of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires the major industrialized nations to meet targets on emissions reduction but imposes no mandates on developing countries, including emerging economic powers and sources of global greenhouse gas emissions like China, India, Brazil and South Africa.
The United States is not a party to the protocol, having refused to even consider ratifying it because of those asymmetrical obligations. Some major countries, including Canada, Japan and Russia, have said they will not agree to an extension of the protocol next year unless the unbalanced requirements of developing and developed countries are changed. That is similar to the United States' position, which is that any successor treaty must apply equally to all major economies.
But the European Union, the major developing countries, and most African and Pacific island nations would like to see the Kyoto process extended as a prelude to a binding international agreement after 2020 to reduce emissions so as to keep the average global temperature from ever rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, or about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above its current level.
Todd Stern, the chief American climate negotiator, said he was flexible as to the form such a future agreement would take and even the time frame for reaching it, though he expects it will be after 2020, once the various Kyoto and Cancun agreements have run their course. He said that all countries, including the United States, must take meaningful unilateral steps to control their carbon dioxide emissions. The obligations are greatest among the 20 or so largest economies, which are responsible for more than 80 percent of global carbon output.
''In reality, the most effective thing we can do to address climate change is for all relevant countries to act vigorously at home,'' Mr. Stern said in an interview, noting that most countries have adopted emissions targets or national action plans that will be followed regardless of the status of the negotiations toward a binding future agreement.
''At the same time,'' Mr. Stern added, ''climate is a classic global commons problem, where each country needs confidence that others are acting, so international cooperation is important, and this then takes you to the core international issue: you can't rationally address this problem at the international level unless you get all the major economies, developed and developing, acting in a common system.''
The United States has been criticized at these gatherings for years, in part because of its rejection of the Kyoto framework and in part because it has not adopted a comprehensive domestic program for reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama has pledged to reduce American emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, but his preferred approach, a nationwide cap-and-trade system for carbon pollution, failed spectacularly in Congress in 2010. United States emissions are down about 6 percent over the past five years, largely because of the drop in industrial and electricity production caused by the recession.

HEADLINE: Worrying Signs In Chinese Exports

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD and REYNOLDS HOLDING

 BODY:
China's manufacturing engine is sputtering, which bodes ill for other Asian exporters like Japan and South Korea. They're counting on China to offset slowing demand from the United States and Europe. But much of what China imports goes into making its own exports. And even what bona fide domestic demand is left is likely to be affected by a trade slowdown.
China's exports show troubling signs. Annual growth in monthly exports has slowed from 34 percent a year ago, to 16 percent. Growth in China's imports from the rest of Asia eased from 90 percent year on year in early 2010 to roughly 20 percent in October. 
Asia's exports to China started booming after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2002, as the country demanded components and machinery it couldn't make. That made the rest of Asia a crucial part of China's supply chain, but also made it more dependent on Chinese export demand.
How much is hard to tell. China's exports of goods made from imported materials are equivalent to 40 percent of its imports. Assuming generously that half of the value of those exports has been added by Chinese workers, it means up to one-fifth of Asia's exports to China are destined for global markets. Then there's the export-related stuff that goes into China but doesn't come out, like equipment and machinery.
Machinery and transport equipment, for example, accounts for roughly 40 percent of Korea's exports to China.
The hope has been that China will consume an increasing share of its Asian imports at home. But domestic demand is unlikely to stand up to an export slowdown. Exports as a portion of gross domestic product have been falling since 2006, but only back to where they were in 2003. And even a small change in exports can influence consumption and investment habits.
The past offers a guide. During the 2008 crisis, China's exports fell 25 percent, and its imports from Asia halved. Then, gross exports were equivalent to 35 percent of China's G.D.P. They account for 29 percent now. It's hard to see how Asian imports will hold up if China's export engine stalls again.
'No Harm, No Foul'
The legal concept of ''no harm, no foul'' is worth preserving. Privacy laws and other statutes enable consumers to sue companies without claiming actual injury. That only encourages dubious legal claims and upends constitutional logic. The Supreme Court gets a chance on Monday to start coming to the same conclusion.
The case involves a homeowner suing an insurance company, but the issue arises in dozens of contexts. Infringing copyrights, secretly tracking Web site visits or making prerecorded calls to cellphones can all prompt lawsuits, even without inflicting any obvious damage. That's because a law prohibiting the behavior also creates a right to sue.
This seeming windfall for undamaged ''victims'' may help deter wrongdoing. But it flies in the face of the Constitution's implicit requirement that litigants have, in effect, skin in the game and suffer a loss. Plenty of courts agree, especially in the privacy area.
In 2005, for example, a federal court said JetBlue passengers couldn't sue the airline for violating its own privacy policy by passing their names to the government because they could not prove damage. Suits against Disney, Microsoft and McDonald's for snooping on Web sites with electronic cookies failed for similar reasons. And this month, LinkedIn customers lost a challenge against the company for leaking their user IDs, again because they also could not show that they had any losses as a result of the breach.
In the case now before the Supreme Court, however, a homeowner was allowed to file a class-action suit against her title insurer after it was accused of paying kickbacks to get business. She didn't complain about high prices or bad service, but merely the violation of her right to a graft-free transaction.
Real injuries can be hard to detect. Illegal payoffs may create conflicts of interest that skew deals in hidden ways. Allowing suits without clear damages, however, also invites the infliction of serious and undue harm.
Risk-taking industries like technology inevitably make mistakes that need to be promptly fixed. But punishing companies with dubious class-action litigation smacks of overkill. The Constitution strikes a useful balance, as the Supreme Court would do well to remind everyone concerned.

HEADLINE: Isolating Syria, Arab Group Sets Broad Sanctions

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR and NADA BAKRI; Liam Stack contributed reporting from Cairo.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The Arab League deepened Syria's international isolation on Sunday by imposing a battery of economic sanctions meant to sever most trade and investment from the Arab world, an unprecedented step against a member state.
The tough measures, aimed at stopping Syria's bloody crackdown on dissidents, constitute another blow to the Syrian economy, already reeling from sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States.
They were a psychological jab as much as an economic one, further eroding Syria's longstanding claim to be the heart of Arabism, a claim already battered by the country's suspension from the league two weeks ago.
For the Arab League, an organization long ridiculed as toothless, it was the second time since the Arab Spring protests began that it had acted against a member country to protect a threatened populace. But while the group invited international military intervention in Libya in March, this time its leaders made clear that sanctions were intended to avoid it. 
The action capped a momentous week in a region that has been pummeled by a year of historic change. President Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down in Yemen, Libya formed a new government, Morocco elected one and Egyptians prepared to vote in their first post-revolutionary elections on Monday.
The sanctions against Syria, backed by 19 member states meeting in Cairo, reflected widespread frustration among Arab governments that Damascus has refused to put in place a peace treaty it accepted three weeks ago as the toll from its crackdown on antigovernment demonstrators continues to mount.
''The position of the people, and the Arab position, is that we must end this situation urgently,'' said Sheik Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani, the foreign minister of Qatar and the league's current chairman. ''It has been almost a year that the Syrian people have been killed.''
The immediate catalyst was Syria's refusal to admit Arab civilian and military observers to oversee the peace agreement, ending a military crackdown that the United Nations says has claimed more than 3,500 lives since March.
The stated aim of the sanctions was not regime change, but to press Syria to comply with the peace plan it had ostensibly accepted.
The league ''is trying its best to get the Syrians to accept the political solution that it is offering them,'' said one diplomat involved, speaking anonymously in line with his government's guidelines. ''But the Syrians keep maneuvering and haggling, and it is just not going to work. They don't get it. They still want to play as if they are in the driver's seat.''
The sanctions include a travel ban against scores of senior officials, a freeze on Syrian government assets in Arab countries, a ban on transactions with Syria's central bank and an end to all commercial exchanges with the Syrian government.
They carve out an exception for important consumer goods, to try to lessen the impact on ordinary Syrians, although those exceptions were not yet spelled out. A ban on all flights from Arab nations will not be enforced yet because of objections from Algeria, diplomats said. The league said it would reconsider that measure in a week.
The sanctions are due to take effect immediately, the Qatari foreign minister said, and the resolution encouraged similar action by the United Nations.
Turkey also threw its support behind the sanctions. ''Nobody can expect Turkey and the Arab League to remain silent on the killings of civilians and the Syrian regime's increasing oppression of innocent people,'' said Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who attended the Arab League meeting.
But two other neighbors, Iraq and Lebanon, two of Syria's largest trading partners, signaled that they would not participate, opening potentially significant gaps in the restrictions.
Iraq abstained from the vote and Lebanon ''disassociated'' itself from the resolution.
Economists estimate that about 50 percent of Syria's exports go to the Arab world and 25 percent of its imports originate there, much of that from its immediate neighbors. Iran and Russia would also probably provide aid to Syria to compensate for lost government revenues.
Syria and its supporters denounced the sanctions as yet another attempt by outsiders to topple the government and break up the country.
Syria made no public comment on the vote on Sunday, but its foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, sent a letter to the league on Saturday, after a draft of the sanctions was circulated, accusing the league of seeking to turn Syria's crisis into an international one and ''to interfere in Syria's internal affairs.''
The sanctions and other measures against Syria are meant ''to deconstruct Syria, not to reform Syria,'' a Lebanese analyst who is close to the government said Sunday, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''In the war against Syria, the economic will take the place of the limited possibility of military intervention.''
League officials took pains to point out that they saw the resolution adopted Sunday -- at a luxury hotel on the outskirts of Cairo rather than amid the tumult at the league's Tahrir Square headquarters -- as an alternative to military intervention.
The sanctions ''demonstrate the need for an Arab solution rather than any foreign intervention,'' said Nabil el-Araby, the league's secretary general. ''That should be clear.''
Officials also insisted that the league was not interested in overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for four decades. But analysts speculated that damaging sanctions were inevitably heading toward that end.
Under sanctions already applied by the United States and the European Union, Syria's two most vital sectors, tourism and oil, have ground to a halt in recent months. Electricity cuts trouble Damascus and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are becoming scarce.
''There is this notion that more sanctions would facilitate a transition,'' said Peter Harling, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, which just issued a pessimistic report about the situation. ''It is unclear that it is bringing the regime to compromise. It could complicate any transition, for example, if the banking sector collapses.''
Analysts said the sanctions also aimed to propel the business class and the elite in Syria's two biggest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, to publicly break with the government. The upper class has remained largely quiet since the uprising began in March, but cutting off access to deals through banks in places like Kuwait and Dubai will hurt.
George Lopez, a sanctions expert at the University of Notre Dame, said the measures would curtail short-term financial flexibility, produce dramatic monetary losses and ''show there is little future in investing in Syria.''
''The freezing of both government and personal assets of high level officials, a combination that had high impact in Libya, now poses a moment of decision to the elites regarding their continued support for Assad,'' he said.
In Syria, the Local Coordinating Committees, which guide the antigovernment demonstrations, hailed the move as further pressure, but worried that the government would find a way to evade the restrictions.
Ordinary people worried that the sanctions would mostly hurt the poor and the middle class, further decreasing their income.
''I think it is time the world realized that economic sanctions are not affecting anyone but the Syrian people,'' said a 23-year-old Damascus resident who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. ''Those who couldn't afford buying bread, now can't afford even smelling bread.''
But many Syrians face far worse. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition rights group operating in exile, reported clashes between army defectors and security forces loyal to the government in northwestern and central Syria over the weekend. It said 59 civilians were killed.
Sheik Hamad, the Qatari minister, said Muslim nations had a religious obligation to stop such deaths, and that he hoped sanctions could do the job without the need for foreign intervention.
''But if the international community does not take us seriously in this,'' he said, ''then I cannot guarantee that there will be no foreign interference.''

HEADLINE: Still Fighting Against AIDS

 BODY:
The latest report from the United Nations agency in charge of the global fight against AIDS reveals substantial success by some measures and stagnation by others. The challenge, in tough times, that must be met is to find enough resources to capitalize on scientific breakthroughs and keep the campaign moving forward. 
The number of people dying from AIDS around the world declined for the third year in a row, falling to 1.8 million in 2010 from a peak of 2.2 million. An arsenal of drugs means that AIDS is no longer an automatic death sentence. And thanks to an infusion of funds from the United States and other donors -- and hard bargaining with drug makers to bring their prices down -- the number of people being treated has soared to 6.6 million of the 14.2 million people sick enough to need the drugs.
An equally important measure -- the ability to prevent new infections -- has stagnated after substantial improvement in earlier years. Annual new infections with the virus that causes AIDS have fallen by roughly 20 percent from the peak in 1997 but have hit a plateau in recent years. About 2.7 million people became newly infected last year. That was twice the number of people brought into treatment for the first time.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton recently laid out an ambitious goal to achieve an ''AIDS-free generation.'' In her vision, virtually no children would be infected by transmission from their mothers -- a goal within reach. And teenagers and adults would either be protected from infection by proven prevention programs, such as condoms and male circumcision, or promptly treated after infection to prevent them from becoming ill or passing the virus on to others. New research has shown that treating infected people with drugs can reduce the risk that they will pass on the virus by 96 percent.
Such prevention and treatment strategies are the only way to get ahead of the epidemic. But the global economic downturn led to a collective decline in donor assistance last year -- to $7.6 billion in 2010 from $8.7 billion in 2009 -- well short of the $24 billion thought needed by 2015. The major international fund will stop making new grants until 2014.
Washington has led the effort to combat AIDS and will need to lead the search for additional donor contributions, greater financing by AIDS-afflicted nations that can afford it, and more cost-effective approaches to prevention and treatment. This is no time to lose ground against a scourge that, while no longer always fatal, is still infecting people faster than they can be tested and treated.

HEADLINE: The Politics of Economics in the Age of Shouting

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
I share a virtual neighborhood with a legion of Times reporters, editors and columnists who know more than I will ever know about business and economics. (Look! Right over there: a Nobel-prize-winning economist!) In this humbling company, on this intimidating matter, who am I to tell anyone what to think? And so my plan was, frankly, to avoid the subject.
But while there are things a columnist can ignore (if Kim Kardashian ever features in this column, just shoot me), our failing economic ecosystem is not one of them. So for the past several weeks my airplane and bedside reading has consisted of sexy documents like ''A Roadmap for America's Future'' and ''The Way Forward'' and ''The Moment of Truth'' and ''Restoring America's Future'' and ''Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future.'' I've also reached out to a few economists respected for the integrity of their science and their patience with economic illiterates. 
The first thing I gleaned from this little tutorial will probably not surprise you: There really is a textbook way to fix our current mess. Short-term stimulus works to help an economy recover from a recession. Some kinds of stimulus pay off more quickly than others. Once the economic heart is pumping again, we need to get our deficits under control. The way to do that is a balance of spending cuts, increased tax revenues and entitlement reforms. There is room to argue about the proportions and the timing, and small differences can produce large consequences, but the basic formula is not only common sense, it is mainstream economic science, tested many times in the real world.
So what's the problem? Why is our system so fundamentally stuck? Partly it's a colossal, bipartisan lack of the political courage required to tell people what they sort of know but don't want to hear. Partly it's a Republican Party that, for its own cynical reasons, wants no deal with this president. Partly it's moneyed, focused lobbies that swarm in defense of specific advantages written into the law; there is no comparable lobby for compromise, let alone sacrifice.
But also, I've come to think something is rotten in the state of economics. The dismal science, as Thomas Carlyle called it, has been ravaged by the same virus that has corrupted the rest of our national discourse.
Back in the very pre-digital days, the writer A. J. Liebling famously remarked that freedom of the press was guaranteed only to the man who owned one. Nowadays, of course, freedom of the press belongs to anyone with Internet access, from the information guerrillas of WikiLeaks to the blogger next door. The democratization of media has diminished the authority once held -- and sometimes abused -- by a few big newspapers and broadcasters. In many ways this has enriched society, creating a great global buffet of information and opinion, pooling the knowledge of the masses and providing an almost instantaneous reality check on the conventional wisdom.
The consequences have not all been happy, though. The easiest way to stand out in such a vast crowd of microbroadcasters is to be the loudest, the angriest, the most outrageous. If you want that precious traffic, you stake out a position somewhere in oh-my-God territory and proclaim it with a vengeance. Global warming is a hoax! Vaccines make you sick! Obama is a Muslim! In vanquishing the conventional wisdom, sometimes it seems we have vanquished wisdom itself.
Economists don't live in caves, so there is no reason they should be immune to the centrifugal politics of this noisy world. Thus serious scholars are tempted to sign onto ideas that stretch their own credulity, and lesser economists are thrust forward for their moment of fame as witnesses on behalf of dubious claims. Economists cluster in ideological think tanks that promote political conformity rather than intellectual rigor. Politicians, with no generally accepted consensus to challenge them, can get away with plucking data out of context to bolster assertions that are based more on faith than on reality. Tax cuts pay for themselves! Protectionism saves jobs! It's all the Fed's fault! Deficits don't matter! Obama is a socialist! Say it often enough and before long it's a serious discussion on cable TV, in which the proven and the preposterous get the same respectful chin-wagging.
''Nobody who is taken seriously as an economist is going to say 'cancel the Fed,' '' said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, and now Mitt Romney's chief economic adviser. ''I find it very disturbing that the media is giving equal time to some ideas that are just crazy.''
The Web site PolitiFact, the Pulitzer-winning fact-checking service, recently did a thorough debunking of Republican claims that Obama's 2009 stimulus program created, quote, ''zero jobs.'' In fact, the checkers established, using still-trustworthy sources like the Congressional Budget Office, that the stimulus created or saved a couple of million jobs. Case closed? No, the Republicans just went on repeating the claim.
''The talking points drive the discourse,'' said Bill Adair, the editor of PolitiFact. ''They repeat the talking points so often I think they start actually believing them.''
In the Internet age, anyone can be an expert, and anyone who says otherwise is an elitist.
The other day House Speaker John Boehner put out a list of 132 economists who signed a statement endorsing a Republican menu of spending cuts, tax cuts and deregulation. All of these are legitimate things to propose, but the statement claimed the Republican list ''will do more to boost private-sector job growth in America in both the near-term and long-term than the 'stimulus' spending approach favored by President Obama.'' Reputable number-crunchers like Moody's Analytics and some top-tier economists of both parties said Boehner's statement would have little or no impact on the short-term employment problem. So who were these 132 economists? With a few exceptions they were academics from off-the-beaten-path colleges (no offense to Dakota State University), bloggers (the Calafia Beach Pundit?) and economists from devoutly libertarian think tanks. But the news had the right-wing tom-toms beating with excitement.
''I've never in my professional life seen the disjunction between the political debate about economics and the consensus of economists be as large as it is today,'' said Justin Wolfers, a Wharton School economist who favors Democrats, and who tweeted withering commentary on the list of 132.
Surely this dilution of authority contributes to our national paralysis. At the very least it befogs the discussion and fosters a pervasive cynicism.
Columbia's Hubbard says the way to weed out the quackery is for serious economists to speak up when silly ideas get a political foothold. He's right, but once a mainstream economist has settled comfortably into a party-line think tank or joined a candidate's brain trust, or even enjoyed the adulation at partisan cocktail parties, a degree of self-censorship takes hold.
Of course, there have always been economists who leaned right or left -- and some outright snake-oil salesmen -- but until recently the public debate about economics pretty much stayed within the boundaries of accepted science. Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman have become conservative icons, John Maynard Keynes and Paul Samuelson are stalwarts of the liberals, but in their lifetimes they all had a reverence for evidence (even if their acolytes did not).
Rereading some of the alternating, left-right weekly columns Samuelson and Friedman wrote for Newsweek in the 70s, I've been struck by their shared assumptions, and by the fact that the tone was so civil. It's not hard to imagine both men signing on to the kind of grand bargain that keeps eluding Congress now. But if they were getting started in today's media market, they would probably be obliged to amp up the vitriol, to sound like the old ''Saturday Night Live'' ''Point-Counterpoint'' parody:
''Paul, you pompous ass!''
''Milt, you ignorant slut!''

HEADLINE: Bad Times Take Bloom Off Rose Parade Ritual

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
PASADENA, Calif. -- With its peppy bands, whimsical floats and flood of flowers, the Rose Parade here has long been a symbol of the hopes of a New Year.
But the sputtering economy and municipal budget cuts are presenting new problems for the Tournament of Roses.
Several cities have had to abandon plans to put up floats for the parade, after doing so for decades. One company that had built floats for 25 years announced that it was going out of business, after its most reliable customers dropped out of the parade. And Occupy protesters threaten to show up 40,000 strong along the parade route to blanket the area with their message that ''not everything is coming up roses.''
As if anyone needed reminding.
Nearly every city in Southern California -- and in hard-pressed regions across the country -- is struggling with deep budget cuts, trimming back park services and reducing the city staff. In the last few years, five cities have dropped out of the parade and several more considered doing so, only to be rescued by private money. Other cities have drastically scaled back their floats to save money. And few of those who left expect to re-enter the parade anytime soon. 
The City of Long Beach, which faced a $43 million gap in its $400 million budget, had put a float in the parade every year for nearly nine decades. But with cutbacks all over the city, including in its tourism department, the decision to drop out was hardly difficult, Mayor Bob Foster said.
''It just doesn't rank high on a priority list during times like this,'' Mr. Foster said. ''I don't relish the decision, but I don't think people are going to argue that we should keep a float when we are cutting libraries.''
In the middle of the 20th century, the parade was a way for small towns in the San Gabriel Valley, northeast of Los Angeles, to attract newcomers. The sun shining on the snow-capped mountains would stoke the westward dreams of viewers bundled up in the Midwest and the Northeast, or so the hope went.
''The message was always 'Come to Southern California and grow,' and everyone wanted to be a part of that,'' said Joe Mathews, an Irvine senior fellow at the New America Foundation and a Pasadena native who has attended dozens of parades. ''But that's a hard sell to make these days, when there is a real slowdown in the number of people coming, and Californians are really schizophrenic about whether they actually want more people.''
And as migration to California has slowed in the past several years, many cities in the region have abandoned any illusions that a float is going to lure anyone.
Even Rick Jackson, the president of the Tournament of Roses Association, finds it a tough sell. Mr. Jackson, an accountant, said he would be hard pressed to tell a city that paying upward of $200,000 for a float is a wise use of money.
''A long time ago, it was less about selling something and more about participating in something,'' said Mr. Jackson, who takes a matter-of-fact view of the changes. ''Now people are looking for a return on their investment. They want to know what they are going to get out of it. That's just the way of the world now.''
And the cutbacks are not limited to cities.
Even some of the most longstanding companies that sponsored floats have bowed out. For the first time in anyone's memory, there will be no team of Clydesdales representing Budweiser and St. Louis. The company, now a subsidiary of a multinational corporation, decided to drop out of the parade to focus on sponsorships that ''reach a higher concentration of beer drinkers'' and ''more directly discuss the Budweiser brand.''
Certainly, other companies and organizations are eager to take the open spots in the two-hour parade, but Mr. Jackson said the waiting list had shrunk considerably in recent years.
Tim Estes has run Fiesta Floats for more than three decades, building it into one of the largest such companies in the region. While he has more than a dozen floats he is building this year, it has not been without ''plenty of hiccups,'' he said.
For years, Mr. Estes built the float for Rain Bird, a sprinkler company based in nearby Azusa that won some of the parade's top honors. But when the company began laying off workers two years ago, executives called Mr. Estes, saying they would drop out.
''For them to leave is huge; it was a point of pride for them, and people would look for their float,'' Mr. Estes said. ''But they had to shut down a plant, and to turn around and then have a Rose Parade float might not look right.''
Mr. Estes said he was not worried that business would come to a halt, but he has watched his profits erode as the prices of steel and flowers have increased.
''I've been doing this all my life,'' Mr. Estes said. ''If I thought I was only going to stay in to make good money, I would have gotten out a long time ago.''
In a place where few leaves change and snow does not fall, the parade is part of the holiday ritual; the metal bleachers begin going up along the parade route before Thanksgiving. Tens of thousands of people camp out the night before for what could be described as a 24-hour party. (Because the parade, normally scheduled for New Year's Day, is never held on a Sunday, this year it will take place on Monday, Jan. 2.)
Initially, people involved in Occupy Pasadena bristled at the notion of protesting along the parade route, but most seem to have come around after organizers assured them that they would not disrupt the parade itself.
Occupy protesters say they plan to bring 40,000 people to the parade and form their own ''human float'' at the end of the route.
''We're in a crisis situation, and we can't pretend that everything is as hunky-dory as people in power want us to believe, when there are tens of thousands of people unemployed here,'' said Peter Thottam, the lead organizer for the Rose Parade protest. ''The parade has been a cultural embodiment of corporatization and militarization of our society. There are thousands of people there, and millions of people watching it on television, and we want to bring our message to them.''
Parade officials said they were not overly concerned.
''We're always worried about a whole host of things,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''We know that groups want to be here for the cameras, and we're always prepared to deal with anything.''
None of this is enough to discourage the parade's most ardent devotees.
When Glendale officials openly discussed dropping out of the parade after 98 years, longer than any city aside from Los Angeles, private donors leapt to help the city cobble together the $100,000 it needed.
''I'm a sentimental person, but even I know this is a tough sell,'' said Dave Weaver, a Glendale city councilman who fought to keep the money for the float. ''There are a lot of things that we have done around here that have just died off. This can't just be another one of those things.''

HEADLINE: Hollywood Labor Fight Looms As Benefit Funds Fall Short

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Bitter disputes over health and pension payments to union members have created plenty of drama in states and cities this year. But do not look for a movie about it -- Hollywood will be too busy dealing with a labor crisis of its own.
After three relatively peaceful years, the entertainment industry is bracing for a showdown next spring. At issue is an enormous projected shortfall in financing for some of the most jealously guarded perks in show business, the heavily gilded health and pension plans. 
No one is talking of a strike yet. In fact, no one with official standing is talking publicly. Leaders of the industry's craft and blue-collar unions and officials of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios and other production companies, have all declined to discuss what will happen when several contracts expire July 31.
But in town hall meetings over the last two months, union leaders have told members that weak industry economics, a tough investment climate and, above all, sharp increases in health care outlays are expected to create a $500 million shortfall by 2015.
''We're going to be asking for money, lots of it,'' Matthew Loeb, the president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (I.A.T.S.E.), told a gathering at the union's Local 80 here in late September. His union represents about 50,000 set designers, makeup artists, grips and other film workers.
To put things in perspective, the contract that in 2008 settled a three-month strike by Hollywood's writers was estimated to include total pay and benefits increases of less than a third that amount over three years. A subsequent, hard-fought three-year deal with the Screen Actors Guild, with about 120,000 members, cost the companies only about $250 million. One person involved with the pension and health plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the situation, called the looming half-billion dollar shortfall ''staggering.''
The workers represented under the stage employees' contracts have been known more for making deals than picking fights. In years past, the union might have been at the bargaining table a year before the contract deadline; this time talks may not start until spring. The last full-blown craft strikes occurred more than a half-century ago, and involved a different configuration of unions; Hollywood's Teamsters, the other major union headed for a 2012 showdown, have not staged a major strike since 1988.
But the current situation is volatile, partly because the Teamsters and some allied unions who share health and pension plans with I.A.T.S.E. aligned the expiration of their contracts with those of the larger theatrical workers alliance by shortening their last contract cycle to two years.
This time, those unions are expected to bargain jointly on health and pension issues. A walkout would instantly stop film and television production in the Los Angeles area, and would affect production in New York and elsewhere, because editors, camera crews and some others are represented on a national basis.
Hollywood's guilds largely resolved their health and pension problems, at least for now, in several agreements over the last year or two. But the craft workers and other film laborers got caught in a whipsaw that involved the financial markets, changes to federal health care law, and some features that are peculiar to the financing and benefit structure of their plans.
In some ways, Hollywood's blue-collar health plans are more generous than those covering actors, writers and directors, who are usually regarded as being higher in the pecking order.
At the gathering in September at Local 80, John Garner, a health care consultant with Levey, Garner & Isaacs, told I.A.T.S.E. members their plans matched or exceeded those of the guilds and others in deductibles, office visit co-pays, member contributions and other measures.
One chart showed that entertainment industry workers pay just $300 as a median per person deductible for services from a preferred provider group. But those in the plan covering craft workers and Teamsters pay no deductible for the same services.
Such generous coverage has come at a cost. The craft workers contribute their residuals payments from the rebroadcast of films on television and elsewhere to their benefits plans, while guild members typically receive the residuals as cash. At the same time, the blue-collar workers for years have been draining an enormous cash reserve in their own plans -- once enough to finance 30 months of benefits -- to meet outlays that have increased as the population has aged and more sophisticated medicine has raised costs.
But what advisers had said was a surplus in the reserve is almost spent. Investments never quite recovered from the market collapse of 2008. Hollywood's residuals payments flattened as the DVD boom ended. Meanwhile, federal health care legislation required plans to cover children to the age of 26, and eliminated lifetime coverage maximums.
It added up to what David Wescoe, the executive administrative director for the health and pension plans for the craft and blue-collar unions, told union members was ''a very dicey picture for the next three-year cycle.''
Speaking at Local 80, he put the pension financing shortage at $190 million. Increased health expenses, he said, would require an additional $180 million to stay even with current benefits. About $75 million would be needed to keep the reserves at a safe level of six to eight months. And falling contributions, if industry economics remain soft, will also hurt.
To some extent, the size of the shortfall may be affected by the decisions of the Supreme Court, which will hear oral arguments on a challenge to the federal health care plan in March. ''It's in their hands,'' read the legend of a photo of the justices in Mr. Wescoe's presentation in September.
But even if the court were to overturn the new law, something must give when the companies and unions meet. ''To leave it the way it is today, we need half a billion dollars,'' Mr. Loeb said.

HEADLINE: Holiday Sales Break Slump, But It's Early

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD; Rebecca Fairley Raney and Steven Yaccino contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Spurred by aggressive promotions from retailers, American consumers opened their wallets over the holiday weekend in a way they had not since before the recession, setting records in sales and traffic.
The National Retail Federation said Sunday that spending per shopper surged 9.1 percent over last year -- the biggest increase since 2006 -- to an average of almost $400 a customer. In all, 6.6 percent more shoppers visited stores on the Thanksgiving weekend than last year.
''American consumers have been taking a deep breath and making a decision that it's O.K. to go shopping again,'' despite the high unemployment rate and other signs of caution, said Ellen Davis, vice president at the National Retail Federation.
Numbers from ShopperTrak, a consumer research service, showed equally strong results, with in-store sales on Friday rising by 6.6 percent over last year's Thanksgiving Friday to $11.4 billion. 
Yet there were signs the gains might not last. Analysts said that traffic to stores seemed to slow through the weekend, suggesting that the big start to the holiday season might peter out over time. And shoppers were using credit cards in large numbers, mall owners and analysts said, signaling that consumers were willing to sacrifice savings more than last year, when they paid with cash more frequently.
''With consumers, it's emotional, so they might feel they need Christmas this year,'' said Margaret Taylor, vice president and senior credit officer in the corporate finance group at Moody's Investors Service. ''They could be willing to take on more credit.''
Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, said in a note to clients that he expected that ''consumers will dig into savings'' or ''temporarily tack on a little more debt'' during the holidays.
Retailers hardly objected. Total spending, including online sales, reached an estimated $52.4 billion Thursday through Sunday, the National Retail Federation said. About 35 percent of that total was spent online, slightly higher than last year, the federation said, suggesting that online retailers' attempts to attract in-store shoppers worked well.
Bill Martin, founder of ShopperTrak, noted that the day after Thanksgiving, usually the year's biggest sales day, is ''one day in a 60-day holiday season.'' Still, he said, ''what we do know is without a strong start to the season it's pretty hard to have a good season.''
Given the tight budgets of customers, major retailers aggressively wooed shoppers, moving back opening hours to midnight on Thanksgiving or earlier. It seems to have worked, attracting more shoppers and giving them more hours on Friday to spend.
Almost a quarter of people who went shopping the Friday after Thanksgiving were in stores by midnight Thursday, the federation found. Among 18- to 34-year-olds who went shopping, that percentage was higher -- 36.7 percent -- than it was among 35- to 54-year-olds, of whom 23.5 percent were in stores by midnight.
''Early Black Friday openings and Thanksgiving-night openings are simply to get a larger share of the customer's wallet,'' Ms. Davis said, adding that research showed that customers tend to spend more at their first stop than at subsequent ones.
Though the longer Friday hours helped bump up sales, some analysts said they might have taken away from steady shopping through the weekend.
''Our perspective is that Black Friday peaked early this year and then lost some of its luster,'' said Alison Jatlow Levy, a retail strategist at the consulting firm Kurt Salmon. On Saturday, ''the malls felt like an average busy Saturday, but not like a Black Friday extravaganza.''
At the midnight opening of Macy's Herald Square on Thanksgiving, about 9,000 customers were in line, up from 7,000 last year. Most looked quite young, many saying they had come for the late-night spectacle rather than for specific deals.
Kester Richards, 18, was at the front of the line and said he had waited four hours. He said he was a regular Macy's shopper and was looking for Ralph Lauren clothes, but had never been to Black Friday before.
Kyun Il Bae, 21, and In Jung Choi, 21, South Korean students studying in New York State, said they had heard about the event and wanted to see what it was like. ''I just like the atmosphere,'' Mr. Bae said. ''It's a popular place, and I heard this is crazy.'' Later, in the store, Mr. Bae did not seem as enthusiastic. He shrugged when asked if he had found any good deals, and looked more exhausted than invigorated.
The midnight openings also may have contributed to the unusually high number of men who were in stores. More men than women shopped throughout the weekend, and they spent more per person, according to the retail federation.
''Men really aren't willing to pull themselves out of bed at 4 a.m. for a bargain, but they will go'' late at night, Ms. Davis said. ''Men are increasingly budget-focused, and like the idea of looking for good deals.''
Stores selling to people of different income levels chose different tactics on Friday, with many of the low- and middle-income retailers opening early with ''door-buster'' discounts, and the luxury stores moving back their opening times by just an hour or two. Still, Mr. Martin said, sales ''were pretty good across all manner of retailers.''
According to the federation, department stores and discounters were the most popular destinations over the weekend, followed by electronics stores.
Shoppers interviewed Thursday night and Friday sounded as if they were on tight budgets, and that drove them to stores.
Amanda Ponce, 40, stood outside a Target in downtown Chicago, an Xbox 360 for her 8-year-old daughter on her shopping list. At $139.99, marked down from $199.99, the savings were crucial this year, she said, since she will be buying fewer presents.
''We've had a lot harder time living the same lifestyle that we lived,'' she said, saying that her husband, a marketing consultant, had been taking on extra work. ''We're focusing more on specifically what she wants instead of an abundance of gifts. Things she'll actually use and play with.''
At a J. C. Penney in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., Maria Aguilar was not buying presents -- she had come in for deals on a coffeepot and a griddle.
''We are definitely cutting back,'' said Ms. Aguilar, 45, an instructional assistant from Norco, Calif. She said that this year, her family was buying gifts for ''just the little ones, just the children.''

HEADLINE: In Gloomy Economic Times, Santas Learn to Help by Curbing Expectations

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Matthew Orr contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MIDLAND, Mich. -- Here, at the nation's oldest, most celebrated, school for would-be Santa Clauses, much has stayed exactly the same over its nearly 75 years. A proper Claus ought to have pleasant breath, his beard curled just so and a hearty laugh that rumbles not from the throat but from deep below the diaphragm.
Yet this year, from the holiday parades, to the cheery carols piping from Main Street loudspeakers, to the ''this way to Santa'' lines at shopping centers, something more sobering has cast its shadow: the economic slump.
The result is a Christmas season in which Santas -- including the 115 of them in this year's graduating class of the Charles W. Howard Santa Claus School -- must learn to swiftly size up families' financial circumstances, gently scale back children's Christmas gift requests and even how to answer the wish some say they have been hearing with more frequency -- ''Can you bring my parent a job?'' 
Santas here tell of children who appear on their laps with lists that include the latest, most expensive toys and their parents, standing off to the side, stealthily but imploringly shaking their heads no. On the flip side, some, like Fred Honerkamp, have been visited by children whose expectations seem to have sunk to match the gloom; not long ago, a boy asked him for only one item -- a pair of sneakers that actually fit.
''In the end, Santas have to be sure to never promise anything,'' said Mr. Honerkamp, an alumnus of the school who also lectures here. He has devised his own tale about a wayward elf and slowed toy production at the North Pole for children who are requesting a gift clearly beyond their family's price range. ''It's hard to watch sometimes because the children are like little barometers, mirrors on what the country has been through.''
The Santa school itself, held in this small, central Michigan city over three days every fall, may offer some measure of the nation's woes. Last month, it drew the largest class of its history. And while most of the men were longtime, passionate Santas looking to hone their skills in hair bleaching, story-telling and sign language, at least a handful, including an aerospace engineer and an accountant, said they were testing out Santa school in part because of slim times, shrunken retirement accounts, or a dearth of work altogether.
''I'm trying it,'' said Joe Stolte, who, at 28, was decades younger than most of the bearded, portly, jarringly similar-looking men in rows all around him. ''There are no jobs out there -- it's ridiculous,'' he said, adding that he had been surviving by doing odd jobs and cutting lawns in Saginaw and that his mother had helped him come up with the tuition ($400 for first-timers, $350 for others). ''I like being Santa Claus. And I figure it comes once a year. It's a thing that's going to be there.''
At the school, which takes place partly in an elaborate, cookie-filled Santa House on Main Street, there is a long-standing if polite debate over the role of money in this entire jolly endeavor. The essence of the split? Nursing Home Volunteer Santa versus Mall Santa.
Kevin Scott Fleming, of Evansville, Ind., lectured fellow Santas on the evolution of a character resembling Saint Nicholas, the Bishop of Myra, and described making money off the beloved character as ''poison, absolutely poison.'' Others, like Pat Adams, of Madisonville, Ky., who was soon to fly to Las Vegas for a 40-day stint in a mall, with help from an agent and paid casino-hotel and plane arrangements, saw no harm. ''I do well,'' he said, adding unapologetically that Mall Santas may earn between $25 and $50 an hour.
''It's a personal choice,'' said Thomas F. Valent, a longtime Santa, who took over operations of the school in 1986 and moved it to Midland, where he also runs a construction company. ''The important thing is that people really like Santa. He stands for all good things. So you just have to be the best Santa you can.''
Still, this is a practical education. Along with training in how to store your wig, how best to answer the questions of kindergartners and how to perform on your local cable access television station, a financial planner advised the Santas (and a handful of Mrs. Clauses) to open pension funds and contribute as much as possible to 401(k) retirement accounts. A marketing consultant and gym instructor urged the Santas, a few of whom dozed in their chairs, to create their own Web sites and extolled the benefits of Facebook and Twitter. ''Drive 'em, drive 'em, drive 'em to that Web site!'' Sabrina Ann Zielinski, the consultant, told the class.
There are other Santa schools. But this one carries a history that leads many here to describe it as the Harvard of the genre and to list it prominently on their resumes and business cards. The school was started in 1937 by Charles W. Howard, a former Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade Santa whose memory is revered in these halls. It was initially based in Albion, N.Y., setting a set of more professional standards for department store Santas.
Some of the lessons might come in handy any year: do not stay too long or children will lose interest; insist on a good, private place (not a boiler room) for changing into your suit; keep your hands in plain view.
But the message has shifted with the times. Some Santas say they now feel a larger obligation to speak up in the face of giant, expensive wish lists, an obligation to lower expectations in a way that only Santas (not parents) can get away with. At least one Santa, Gary Christie, had devised a specific routine for talking children out of their demand for an iPod or the like.
Another, Rick Parris, said, ''When kids start asking for the world now, I just say, 'Hey, look, Johnny, you ain't getting all that.' '' The former Alabama state trooper added, ''I just make sure to let them know that Santa seldom brings everything on a list.''
Even with the economic downturn, not all the Christmas lists have grown shorter. Some children show up with elaborate printouts, cross-referenced spread sheets and clippings from catalogs. ''I try to guide the children into not so unrealistic things, and I do tell them that Santa's been cutting back too,'' said Tom Ruperd, of Caro, Mich., who added that parents often silently signal their appreciation.
When questions get more complex, Mr. Ruperd said, they sometimes require ''creative answers.'' The solutions, it seems, may be beyond what any school could prepare one for, and possibly out of Santa's reach altogether. ''If they asked for something that's totally impossible -- a job for Daddy, say -- I usually tell them, 'Santa specializes in toys, but we can always pray on the other,' '' Mr. Ruperd said. '' 'Is there anything in toys that you'd like?' ''

HEADLINE: In Newark, a More Welcoming Response to Occupiers

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
NEWARK -- The protesters attracted no drum circles but bobbed their heads to the rap music blasting from a passing sedan.
They have crossed paths with few one-percenters -- the group assembles not near Wall Street but across from a moldering shop that sells striped pajamas for 99 cents.
And there has been no pepper spray. But protesters did receive a personal delivery of doughnuts and coffee from the mayor on a recent Saturday night. ''It was cold,'' Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark said. ''I thought it would be nice.'' 
Indeed, the Occupy Newark protest has unfolded with disarming civility in one of the nation's grittiest cities.
Since its formation over the past few weeks, beside a row of shuttered storefronts and discount shops in a plaza called Military Park, where a shoelace binds the gate protecting a commemorative cannon, the demonstrators have mostly gathered on weekends. ''That's the time most people can come,'' one said plainly.
On Nov. 18, the city's police chief, Sheilah Coley, said she would waive the permit ordinarily required to assemble in Military Park, telling protesters that her officers' task was ''to make sure you're safe.''
And Tuesday, members of the city's Municipal Council said they supported lifting the 9 p.m. curfew that typically governs the plaza. One member declared his unwavering support for ''operation whatever you call it,'' to boisterous applause.
''It's a good thing that it's amicable,'' said Donna Jackson, 47, a longtime Newark resident and one of the protesters. ''People here are so beat up.''
The dynamics have shifted somewhat in recent days, as officers on Saturday removed three tents.
Protesters promised to ''push the envelope further'' after that episode, though they seemed to have taken the reprimand in stride. After the tents were taken down, about a half-dozen people stayed through the night anyway, crooning ''Bohemian Rhapsody,'' among other numbers, as they took karaoke requests from viewers of the live video feed on their Web site.
Of course, relations between Occupy protesters and their city can be inherently fragile. In Philadelphia, despite consistent expressions of sympathy from much of the local government, protesters were asked on Sunday to abandon their encampment, where they had been for weeks.
Still, throughout the Newark protest, acrimony has been minimal, participants say, because unlike in Lower Manhattan, few bankers or corporate executives pass the site during the day.
The city's median household income from 2005 to 2009 was $35,507, according to the Census Bureau, barely half of the state median and roughly $15,000 less than the national figure.
Occupy Newark remains small, attracting no more than a few dozen participants to a typical meeting. Many are from Newark; others come from neighboring cities and towns; a few are alumni of Occupy Wall Street, dispatched from across the Hudson River to dispense advice on how to expand the protest.
At the meeting Tuesday of the Municipal Council -- where residents often speak too close to the microphone as they air grievances, and a fan blows through a dirty slit in the wall to make the American flag wave when the National Anthem is played -- protesters said they planned to shout down council members and enumerate the demands of their occupation.
But as the meeting entered its fourth hour, some began to lose their nerve.
''Should we do a mike check?'' one whispered to a peer, referring to the movement's hallmark call-and-response tactic. ''That's what we do, right?''
After officials praised their cause, the group decided against an interruption.
For many protesters, the message has remained persistently local, particularly when compared with the sprawling ambitions of the gatherings in Manhattan and other cities.
Grievances include Newark's murder rate, the city's unemployment levels, and layoffs last year to the police force, which thinned the department's ranks by more than 160 officers.
Demonstrators have begun partnering with groups like the People's Organization for Progress and the New Jersey Teacher Activist Group to plan marches and teach-ins.
Bilal Salaam, 31, a graduate student at the Newark campus of Rutgers University, said he was unsure how the occupation might resonate with city residents without attention-grabbing civil disobedience or the obvious corporate adversaries that often stroll past the protests in Manhattan.
''It's been three weeks of waiting,'' he said Friday night. ''We're waiting for them to tell us we can usurp these laws.''
Another protester overheard. ''Guys, Bilal wants to get arrested,'' he announced to the group. ''Can we help him?''
Some demonstrators noted that in 1999, as a member of the Municipal Council, Mr. Booker pitched a tent during a 10-day hunger strike in front of a housing project.
''I know the tradition,'' Mr. Booker said in an interview. ''In many ways, I wish they would go to some other neighborhoods within our city. It would consolidate police presence within communities that are asking for it.''
Many protesters, though, have found symbolism in the current location. Councilman Ras J. Baraka, who visited the site on Friday and pledged to stay overnight on a future date, noted that Prudential Financial's headquarters were visible from the park. ''That's as corporate as Newark is going to get,'' he said, gazing at the structure behind a lingerie shop and a bargain shoe store.
Teisha Miles, 23, sat a few feet away, rarely leaving her chair during the protest, she said, because her fourth child was due ''any day.'' She pointed to the bus stop along the western edge of the park, beside an elevated clock whose hour hand never budges.
''It should be here,'' she said. ''There's crime on the buses, too.''
