HEADLINE: Mel Gibson Can't Topple 'Avatar'

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
And the blue money just keeps rolling in.
 The much-hyped return to the multiplex of Mel Gibson, whose drunken and anti-Semitic outburst in 2006 turned him into a Hollywood pariah, proved no threat to James Cameron's ''Avatar,'' which was No. 1 at the weekend box office for the seventh weekend in a row and passed the $2 billion mark globally. 
 ''Avatar'' sold about $30 million in tickets at North American theaters for a new domestic total of $594.5 million.
 Overseas ''Avatar,'' from 20th Century Fox, did about $95 million in business over the weekend. It now ranks as the No. 1 film of all time in terms of revenue (without adjusting for inflation) with $2.04 billion in global sales.
 Heading into the weekend, box office analysts were unsure what to expect from Mr. Gibson's crime thriller ''Edge of Darkness.'' Had moviegoers forgotten his rant and the subsequent tabloid brush fire? Many people in the movie business still harbor raw feelings about it.
 ''Edge of Darkness'' ended up in second place with about $17 million, a solid result given Mr. Gibson's tarnished reputation and eight-year absence from a leading movie role. Warner said exit polls showed that 69 percent of the audience listed Mr. Gibson's presence as the primary reason for attending.
 ''There was probably some concern going in about what his fan base really was, but we feel terrific about this result,'' said Dan Fellman, Warner's president for theatrical distribution. ''I think strong word of mouth will propel the movie forward very nicely.''
 Mr. Gibson plays a Boston homicide detective in the picture, which was produced and financed by GK Films, BBC Films and Mr. Gibson's company. Warner bought the distribution rights for about $27 million. The movie, which received mixed reviews, was directed by Martin Campbell (''Casino Royale'').
 The inexpensive romantic comedy ''When in Rome'' (Walt Disney Studios) was third for the weekend with about $12 million, according to Hollywood.com, which tracks ticket sales. The film performed best as a date movie, with exit polls showing couples made up 75 percent of the audience.
 ''Tooth Fairy,'' the Fox comedy starring Dwayne Johnson, was fourth with about $10 million and a new total of $26 million. Denzel Washington's supernatural adventure ''Book of Eli'' (Alcon Entertainment via Warner) was fifth with about $8.7 million ($74 million total).

HEADLINE: After Losing a Post, Qaddafi Rebukes the African Union

BYLINE: By JASON McLURE

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia 

 BODY:
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, delivered a rambling rebuke of fellow African heads of state Sunday after they chose to replace him as chairman of the African Union and failed to endorse his push for the creation of a United States of Africa. 
 ''I do not believe we can achieve something concrete in the coming future,'' said Colonel Qaddafi, before introducing President Bingu wa Mutharika of Malawi as his successor at the African Union's annual summit meeting, held in Addis Ababa. ''The political elite of our continent lacks political awareness and political determination. The world is changing into 7 or 10 countries, and we are not even aware of it.''
 South Africa, Ethiopia and Nigeria were among the countries opposing Colonel Qaddafi's attempts to form a continental government, which many view as impractical given the political and economic disparities in Africa.
 Colonel Qaddafi argued that individual African states are too weak to negotiate with major powers like the European Union, the United States and China. His efforts to become the first African leader to win another one-year term as chairman of the African Union were thwarted by a push for Mr. Mutharika, 75, by the 15-member Southern African Development Community. 
 The Libyan leader also complained that such summit meetings were boring, that his colleagues were too long-winded and that he often was not informed of African Union decisions. 
 Colonel Qaddafi did not leave the lectern before giving the microphone to an unnamed representative of a Libyan-sponsored group of African traditional leaders who had crowned him ''King of Kings'' in a ceremony in 2008. 
 The representative, bearing a golden scepter and trailed by an aide fanning him with a large feather, spent much of his address praising Colonel Qaddafi. 
 ''You have the African people with you,'' said the man, who spoke in French and did not identify himself. ''This is what is important, not politicking. It is politicians who have destroyed us.''

HEADLINE: Walking Away From Debt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I read that Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty are walking away from their $3 billion loan commitments on Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village (''Stuyvesant and Cooper Surrendered to Creditors,'' news article, Jan. 25). 
 They are underwater on their debt and have failed to renegotiate it. Therefore they have decided it no longer makes financial sense for them to keep on paying their obligation.
 Where is the indignation -- the same furor and moral outrage an individual homeowner would face if he did the same thing? Why is it moral, logical and perfectly acceptable for corporations to default on a debt but sinful, almost criminal, for a struggling homeowner to do the same thing?
 Why hasn't the banking industry taken the same stand against corporations as it takes against individuals? Will Tishman's credit rating be forever tarnished? Will it be forever barred from acquiring loans in the future? Will no one ever deal with it again? I don't think so! If anything, it will be praised for the logic behind its difficult, heart-wrenching but economically necessary decision.
 We obviously have a two-track economic morality -- one for ''small loans'' and one for ''serious money.''
 Michael Lubov Briarwood, Queens, Jan. 25, 2010
 To the Editor:
 One outrageous aspect of the ''failed'' deal for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, where the buyers have turned the keys over to the lenders, was that pension funds for teachers and public employees in California -- California State Teachers' Retirement System and Calpers -- squandered hundreds of millions of dollars on an investment predicated on pushing middle-class tenants like New York City teachers and public employees out of their apartments and shrinking the supply of affordable housing for those constituencies and other middle-income New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Amid Drama of Police Trial, a Judge Unfazed

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
The afternoon court session grew more heated in its final hour. Michael Mineo, who prosecutors say was sodomized with a police officer's baton during a stop, faced tough questions about the extent of his injuries and whether he remembered the color of his blood.
 In the middle of that critical testimony, a lawyer for the officer requested a recess. Justice Alan D. Marrus waved him off.
 The lawyer asked again. ''I must go, judge,'' he said, suggesting that it was nature and not strategy guiding the request. Then he caught a break: The court reporter needed to change paper. So Justice Marrus grudgingly agreed to do what he had been loath to in his 24 years on the bench in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn: slow down the action.
 ''Go ahead,'' he told the lawyer with a resigned shrug. 
 It is not that Justice Marrus, 63, is impatient, or does not believe in breaks, he said later in an interview.
 ''I try to run a trial on a schedule, and have a plan,'' he said. ''The jurors seem to like that, too.''
 Justice Marrus arrives at the courthouse in Downtown Brooklyn at 7 a.m. and is usually sitting in his courtroom before the day's proceedings begin. ''I don't make an entrance,'' he said.
 He tells lawyers not to show up late, and has been known to warn that if they do, he might seat the jurors without them. He often brushes off requests for sidebars, saying that most of the discussions can be public; but he also does it, lawyers suspect, because the sessions take up precious time.
 Since 1986, by his clerk's count, Justice Marrus has heard more than 550 cases. ''He's probably tried more cases than most trial judges in the city, if not the state,'' said Barry M. Kamins, the administrative judge for criminal matters in the Second Judicial District of New York. ''He runs a tight ship. And he keeps things moving very quickly.''
 The latest case for Justice Marrus, which started more than a week ago, is a high-profile police brutality trial in which Officer Richard Kern is accused of repeatedly ramming a retractable baton between Mr. Mineo's buttocks in the Prospect Park subway station and two other officers are accused of helping cover up the abuse.
 On Monday, the judge will preside over what may be the trial's most critical moments: A transit police officer, Kevin Maloney, is expected to break ranks and testify that he saw Officer Kern jab Mr. Mineo with his baton.
 Surrounded by lawyers with outsize personalities, and confronted with an accuser whose testimony involved screaming and showing off tattoos, Justice Marrus has presided with a steady hand, unruffled by the drama or the public attention. He has warmed jurors each morning with a joke (''I'm still waiting to be discovered,'' he said), smiled when lawyers made grand stands and calmed nervous witnesses.
 ''Can I let my heart beat for a second?'' asked one witness, Ashley Loney, a friend of Mr. Mineo's. Let it beat for longer than that, Justice Marrus said.
 The judge's smile disappeared when lawyers or prosecutors argued with witnesses or made lazy attempts to score points with jurors. ''That was a bad question,'' he said one day. ''Come up with a good question.'' 
 Smile or no smile, the days have unfolded with precision: Court starts shortly after 10 a.m. and ends between 4 and 5 p.m. Everyone is off on Fridays.
 Not everyone appreciates the judge's efficiency. A lawyer who has appeared before Justice Marrus several times and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he expected to appear before him again, said that in tamping down lawyers' ''flowery'' tendencies, the judge can stifle their efforts to connect with jurors. ''He wants to get right to the point,'' the lawyer said.
 But other lawyers praised the judge's economy. Nicholas Gravante Jr. was trying a case before Justice Marrus during the Sept. 11 attack. ''His ability to keep the jury together through that very difficult ordeal, and complete the trial in an efficient manner, was one of the most remarkable things I've seen,'' Mr. Gravante said. ''As a criminal defense lawyer, he allowed me to try my case.''
 Punctuality was a lesson that Justice Marrus said he learned early, from his mother, Sara Marrus, who told him, ''It was inconsiderate to keep people waiting for you.'' He was 13 when Mrs. Marrus moved her family from Mount Vernon, N.Y., to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, after her husband died.
 Young Alan chose law in his junior high school career book, and that was that. After Brooklyn College and George Washington University Law School, he became the first lawyer in his family, then a prosecutor. In 1983, he was appointed to Manhattan Criminal Court as a judge.
 Justice Marrus raised two children in the Manhattan Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn, not far from where he grew up; his daughter is a federal prosecutor, and his son is in law school. His wife of 38 years, Iris, is a singer and teaches how to incorporate music in early childhood education at Kingsborough Community College and Lehman College.
 Those who know the judge call him a thoughtful jurist who trains new judges, lectures extensively and shows confidence in his legal rulings. Last year, in one such ruling, Justice Marrus harshly rebuked a mother who tried to prove her son's innocence by seducing one of the jurors in the son's murder trial. 
 In his forceful ruling, he said the mother, Doreen Giuliano, had been ''acting as a self-appointed juror misconduct vigilante, with the obvious intention to destroy the credibility of a jury verdict that went against her son.''
 In his spare time, Justice Marrus coaches the judges' softball team and writes comedy routines -- for a friend and former judge who performs stand-up or as M.C. of events like a statewide judges' seminar.
 He has become known for the novel way he picks juries, using a technique he developed in 1986, when Joseph Pepitone, a former Yankee, sat in his court on drugs charges. ''He was very famous at the time,'' Justice Marrus recalled. ''We figured it would be hard to get jurors right away.'' In that case and in many high-profile cases since, including the current one, the judge prescreened jurors, speeding up the process.
 The jury in Mr. Mineo's case was picked in less than three hours.
 Apart from the lawyer's bathroom request, the judge has looked impatient only one other time -- again, during a break he did not foresee. He paced at the bench for a minute, then started chatting with a witness.
 One day, as a prosecutor began questioning a witness, an undercover investigator, the action moved so fast that Justice Marrus realized he had forgotten something: the jury.
 It was not entirely his fault. It was a closed court session, and the judge seemed preoccupied with special arrangements he had made to secure the courtroom and make sure the news media could see the proceedings.
 ''We became so security conscious that we forgot to bring out the jury,'' he said, chuckling with embarrassment. ''I've never done that before.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Arms For Taiwan Send Beijing A Message

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For the past year, China has adopted an increasingly muscular position toward the United States, berating American officials for the global economic crisis, stage-managing President Obama's visit to China in November, refusing to back a tougher climate change agreement in Copenhagen and standing fast against American demands for tough new Security Council sanctions against Iran.
 Now, the Obama administration has started to push back. In announcing an arms sales package to Taiwan worth $6 billion on Friday, the United States leveled a direct strike at the heart of the most sensitive diplomatic issue between the two countries since America affirmed the ''one China'' policy in 1972. 
 The arms package was doubly infuriating to Beijing coming so soon after the Bush administration announced a similar arms package for Taiwan in 2008, and right as tensions were easing somewhat in Beijing and Taipei's own relations. China's immediate, and outraged, reaction -- cancellation of some military exchanges and announcement of punitive sanctions against American companies -- demonstrates, China experts said, that Beijing is feeling a little burned, particularly because the Taiwan arms announcement came on the same day that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clintonpublicly berated China for not taking a stronger position on holding Iran accountable for its nuclear program. 
 While administration officials sounded a uniform public note, cautioning Beijing not to allow this latest tiff to damage overall relations, some administration officials suggested privately that the timing of the arms sales and the tougher language on Iran was calculated to send a message to Beijing to avoid assumptions that President Obama would be deferential to China over American security concerns and existing agreements. 
 ''This was a case of making sure that there was no misunderstanding that we will act in our own national security interests,'' one senior administration official said. A second Obama administration official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said pointedly: ''Unlike the previous administration, we did not wait until the end of our administration to go ahead with the arms sales to Taiwan. We did it early.''
 But larger questions remain about where the Obama administration is heading on China policy, and whether the new toughness signals a fundamentally new direction and will yield results that last year's softer approach did not. 
 Beyond the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, management of the American relationship with China is one of Mr. Obama's biggest foreign policy challenges. Flush with cash, China's economy is growing mightily, and China has become one of the biggest foreign lenders to the United States. China also is an increasingly critical American trading partner and a global rival in influence and economic power. 
 ''The president's view is that obviously we have to have a mature enough relationship with China that we can be candid and firm where we disagree and cooperate forcefully when we agree,'' a senior administration official said. He insisted that the timing of the arms package and Mrs. Clinton's tough words were ''not designed to send a gratuitous message to China, but to demonstrate the firmness of our position.''
 China has a history of getting off to a tough start with American administrations. President Bill Clinton alienated Beijing with tough talk on human rights, even signing an executive order that made renewal of trade privileges for China dependent on progress on human rights. But Mr. Clinton reversed himself in 1994, saying that the United States and China would move forward faster on issues of mutual concern if Beijing was not isolated. 
 Similarly, President George W. Bush's first dealings with the Chinese were also fractious, including an effort to recover American airmen whose spy plane was forced down off the Chinese coast.
 ''The Obama administration came in exactly the opposite,'' said Steven Clemons, director of foreign policy programs at the New America Foundation. ''They needed China on economic issues, climate change, Iran, North Korea. So they came in wanting to do this lovely dance with China, but that didn't work.''
 Instead, China pushed back hard, including at the Copenhagen climate change summit meeting in December, when Beijing balked at American and European demands that China agree to an international monitoring system for emissions targets. Twice, the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, sent an underling to represent him at meetings with Mr. Obama, in what diplomats said was an intentional snub. Mr. Obama later had to track down Mr. Wen, surprising him and appearing at the doorway of a conference room where Mr. Wen was meeting with the leaders of South Africa, Brazil and India.
 The United States and China eventually reached a compromise on the monitoring agreement, but the whole incident left a bad taste in the mouths of many Obama administration officials, who believed China had deliberately set out to belittle Mr. Obama, and who were determined to push back and reassert American authority.
 ''The Chinese,'' said James J. Shinn, who was assistant secretary of defense for Asia during the Bush administration, ''now seem to have a palpable sense of confidence that they're more in the driver's seat than two years ago, across a whole range of issues.''
 For Mr. Obama, the arms sale to Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province, may be only the first of many instances this year in which he will run afoul of Beijing.
 Some foreign policy experts said that the administration now seemed intent on poking at the sovereignty issues that have long been China's Achilles' heel. Mrs. Clinton noted on Friday that Mr. Obama would soon be meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama -- a meeting that White House officials put off last summer to avoid alienating Beijing in advance of Mr. Obama's China trip. China regards the Dalai Lama as an advocate of Tibetan independence. 
 ''China is feeling very confident these days, but the one thing that the Chinese freak out about consistently are sovereignty issues,'' said Mr. Clemons of the New America Foundation. ''So anything related to Taiwan or Tibet will get them going.''
 Added to that, the administration has been championing Internet freedom recently, another source of public tension with Beijing. China's government is embroiled in a fight with Google over that company's complaints about Internet censorship and hacking attacks it says originated in China.
 But the tougher American positions do not change the fact that Mr. Obama needs Chinese cooperation on a host of issues. Beyond his efforts to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions, the president is also working with Beijing on similar ambitions in North Korea. 
 And Mr. Obama announced in his State of the Union address last week that he planned to double American exports in the next five years, an ambitious goal that cannot be met unless he somehow persuades China to let its currency appreciate, making Chinese products more expensive in the United States and American products more affordable in China.

HEADLINE: Insuring Endorsements Against Athletes' Scandals

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
In the wake of the Tiger Woods scandal, insurers are being inundated with inquiries from corporations seeking to protect their investments, their brands and even their sales when their celebrity endorsers suffer public embarrassment.
 Many companies take out death and disability insurance to cover themselves in the event that an athlete or celebrity endorser dies or is injured while under contract. In a new wrinkle, more companies are trying to insure against the potential loss of sales when an athlete product endorser is involved in a scandal.
 ''Companies are saying if it could happen to Tiger Woods, it could happen to anyone,'' said Brian Socolow, a lawyer who runs the sports practice at Loeb & Loeb, which represents athletes and companies in sponsorship deals. ''For some companies, it's a tremendous investment, and when it goes bad, it is not only the loss of investment, it's a black eye for the company.'' 
 Dan Trueman, who runs the enterprise risk department at R J Kiln & Company, the managing agent for Lloyd's, said his firm had seen an eightfold increase in inquiries into this type of insurance between September and December, the bulk from pharmaceutical and financial service companies. ''It's more than just the flavor of the week,'' he said.
 Calculating the amount to insure against is not easy. Insurers said they based their assumptions on how much revenue grew after an athlete or celebrity became a company endorser. In some cases, the cause and effect is direct -- for example, in the case of signature Tiger Woods golf shirts sold by Nike. But companies that employ athletes or celebrities for more generic brand building are now also looking for financial protection.
 Famous endorsers, according to Lori Shaw, the director of the sports and leisure practice at Aon, a leading sports insurance broker, ''can have a significant impact on a corporation's balance sheet, depending on how much revenue is tied to a specific celebrity.''
 Indeed, the stock prices of the seven publicly held companies that have or had sponsorship deals with Woods lost $12 billion in market value in the month after Woods's statement in December that he was taking a leave from golf, according to a study by Chris Knittel, a professor of economics at the University of California at Davis. 
 An increasingly common strategy for companies to better protect themselves is to change the language in their morals clauses to cover more contingencies. The more specific the language, the more expensive the insurance becomes, according to executives in the industry.
 Athletes usually prefer that a morals clause gives the company the right to terminate their agreement only when the player is convicted of a felony involving ''moral turpitude'' or worse, because a conviction could take years and the risk of conviction is relatively low.
 Companies, by contrast, want the broadest rights possible to cover ''any occurrence'' that involves ''moral turpitude, or makes any statement or commits any act disparaging of, or reflecting unfavorably upon, the company's reputation or the company's products and services,'' according to one type of morals clause.
 Companies struggle with this language because they can spend tens of millions of dollars on athletes' contracts and advertising campaigns. Insurance policies can cover money paid to athletes as well as the cost of producing and booking television commercials, print advertisements and other promotions. Some insurers will also cover the costs of new commercials with replacement athletes.
 The recent scandal and the growing dollar value of athlete endorsement deals is going to lead more companies to pursue more insurance, said Phil de Picciotto, the president for athletes and personalities at the Octagon sports agency. Companies are also going to push for shorter-term contracts that push for a greater percentage of their money in the form of incentives payable when athletes meet certain on-field targets.
 Some companies may also stop using current athletes and opt instead for retired or deceased athletes. Other companies will vet athletes more carefully by hiring private detectives to do background checks, said Bill Duffy, the chairman of BDA Sports Management, which represents Steve Nash, Yao Ming and other basketball players.
 According to Trueman, the underwriter at Kiln: ''Tiger Woods has made people think about their reputations. These days, people don't worry about the office burning down, but about their intellectual property being damaged.''

HEADLINE: Incremental Steps in Iraq To Let Kurdistan Oil Flow

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER

DATELINE: ERBIL, Iraq 

 BODY:
The semiautonomous region of Kurdistan is the one place in battered Iraq that promised economic boom times, but some of the foreign oil companies that rushed in over the past few years are becoming increasingly restless. 
 Their multibillion-dollar deals are still mired in a bitter political dispute between the Kurdish region and the central government in Baghdad.
 They may have a stake in what is shaping up to be one of the greatest oil bonanzas of modern times, but the prospect of earning a profit, let alone recovering their costs, remains highly uncertain.
 More potential headaches loom as public demands for scrutiny of local oil contracts for suspected improprieties have gathered momentum. The calls have come in the wake of revelations in November that a former American diplomat had a business relationship with a Norwegian company drilling for oil here, while also acting as a political adviser to the Kurds during the drafting of Iraq's Constitution in 2005. 
 ''It is the single most important question for all of us: How to get paid?'' said Grant Harms, an executive with Niko Resources Ltd., during a gathering Thursday night of oil companies in a plush hotel conference room in the region's capital, Erbil. 
 The issues of payment and the delays all the political wrangling was imposing on their business plans were high on the agenda as the oilmen dined on lamb roast and shrimp and sipped imported wine.
 Several companies had already invested billions of dollars and supplied oil and gas without receiving any compensation.
 In a bid to ease some of the immediate business concerns of the more than 30 foreign oil companies now working in the region, the Kurdish government recently presented Baghdad with a major compromise that would allow the Norwegian company DNO and a Chinese-Turkish joint venture called Ttopco to resume exports of about 100,000 barrels a day via Iraq's pipeline network. They were stopped in October following disagreement between Baghdad and Erbil over how the companies should be paid. 
 The thrust of the proposed compromise involves the two producers' offering the oil to Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization, or SOMO, which would compensate them initially just for their costs, according to Barham Salih, the region's prime minister.
 ''It is a practical proposal and a way to getting beyond the impasse,'' Mr. Salih said in an interview at his home in Sulaimaniya.
 ''It generates an environment of good confidence where we can move to settling this issue in a fundamental way.''
 Mr. Salih said he outlined the proposal in a letter to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki appended with copies of the contracts with DNO and the two partners in Ttopco -- Turkey's Genel Energy and the Swiss-based Addax Petroleum Corp., now owned by China's Sinopec Corp.
 He said he subsequently spoke by telephone with Mr. Maliki, who told him he was ''impressed'' with the proposal and promised to discuss it with Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq's oil minister.
 The main elements of the Kurdish proposal were also outlined in a statement by Ashti Hawrami, the region's minister for natural resources, and posted on the local government's Web site last month.
 The more contentious issue of profit sharing and the question of the ultimate legitimacy of the region's production-sharing agreements in the eyes of Baghdad will be dealt with on a separate track, added Mr. Salih.
 The Kurdish region contends that it has every right under Iraq's Constitution to sign the contracts, while Baghdad maintains that they are illegal in the absence of a national hydrocarbons law, and has blacklisted the companies operating in the region.
 A manager with Genel welcomed Mr. Salih's initiative and predicted that exports would resume soon from the Taq Taq and Tawke fields, where the company owns stakes of 51 percent and 25 percent respectively. 
 But another oil executive said the initiative was a temporary fix and might even lead to financial and contractual complications. ''It is going to be disturbing, to say the least, to the contractual economics for each investor,'' said the executive, who was not authorized to make public statements and requested anonymity. 
 Mr. Hawrami, the regional minister, did not respond to several requests for comment.
 Adding to the uncertainties are national elections in March, increased pressure on Mr. Salih's government from an emboldened internal Kurdish opposition, and calls in the raucous local news media to publish all oil contracts.
 A senior Kurdish government official said all contracts were currently being audited for any potential financial improprieties.
 The same official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter, expressed anger at reports last week that Peter W. Galbraith, an influential former American ambassador, and a Yemeni businessman could potentially reap up to $144 million in a court settlement with DNO.
 ''This guy was supposedly a friend of the Kurds, come to defend the Kurds, but for him to engage in business activities on the side like that, it is not nice, it is not proper,'' the Kurdish official said of Mr. Galbraith.
 ''He says that he has told people, but I am sure he has not disclosed the whole thing.''
 Ahmed Mira, a Kurdish investigative reporter and lecturer at a university near Sulaimaniya, said there were serious rifts between Mr. Salih and his predecessor, Nechirvan Barzani, whose government signed most of the contracts and who remains an influential business figure.
 He said officials inside key ministries remained loyal to Mr. Barzani and were pushing back efforts by Mr. Salih for greater transparency.
 ''Nechirvan remains the prime minister of a shadow government,'' said Mr. Mira.
 Mr. Salih strongly denied any splits and said his government enjoyed the full support of the Barzanis, including the region's powerful president, Massoud Barzani. He said the region's 2010 budget would require more disclosure of the government's financial activities relating to oil and gas. 
 Amid all the political uncertainty, most foreign oil executives tried to put on a brave face and focus on the ultimate prize during their monthly event in Erbil.
 John Ashbridge, chief operating officer of ShaMaran Petroleum Corp., who flew in from Geneva for the occasion, said he was confident the differences between Baghdad and Erbil would eventually be sorted out. 
 He said his main concern was the lack of adequate pipeline infrastructure to export the oil particularly given all the contracts signed recently by Baghdad with oil companies to sharply increase production.
 ShaMaran, a subsidiary of Swedish oil and mining conglomerate Lundin, has interests in three oil blocks in the Kurdistan region, including Pulkhana, which is south of the city of Kirkuk in the heart of a volatile area subject to a bigger territorial dispute between the region and Baghdad. 
 ''This place is a time warp, the whole of Iraq is a time warp,'' said Mr. Ashbridge. ''If you are an investor in oil and gas, this is the place to be.''

HEADLINE: Disney Is Said to Be Seeking a Buyer for Its Beleaguered Miramax Unit

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company has been quietly shopping what remains of its Miramax film unit and has attracted seven to 10 interested bidders, according to a mergers and acquisitions expert with knowledge of the process.
 The initial discussions indicate a price of over $700 million for the Miramax name and its 700-film library, including films like ''Pulp Fiction'' and ''Shakespeare in Love,'' which is essentially all that remains of the once-mighty art house label, according to the person, who declined to be identified because of the confidential nature of the negotiations. 
 Interest is sharply higher than a year ago, when Disney briefly floated a Miramax sale before reconsidering because of the recession, and has been helped by a loosening of the credit markets. 
 Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein, who founded Miramax in 1979, are not among the bidders -- so far. The Weinstein brothers sold Miramax to Disney in 1993 but ran it until 2005, when they left to found the Weinstein Company.
 A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment.
 One potential buyer is Summit Entertainment, the privately owned studio that is awash in cash because of its two ''Twilight'' blockbusters. Summit does not have a large library and, despite its success, could use the steady if diminishing DVD and television-resale income that comes from one. Analysts estimate that the Miramax library generates more than $300 million in annual DVD and television revenue, but they warn that Disney has never broken out a number.
 A Summit spokesman declined to comment. Deadline.com, the Hollywood blog, reported last week that Summit was looking at Miramax. 
 Among the interested parties are several private equity groups and at least one other independent studio, the person with knowledge of the matter said Sunday. Disney expects to move forward with the more serious bidding inquiries in the coming days, the person said, adding that a sale could come within a few months.
 Miramax was more responsible than any other company for bringing specialty films to the multiplex masses. Its library includes hits like ''Chicago,'' ''Kill Bill,'' ''The Queen,'' ''The English Patient'' and ''No Country for Old Men.'' The films in the Miramax library have been nominated for more than 200 Academy Awards.
 Disney has wanted to find a new home for the Miramax label for some time as it focuses more intently on big-budget, branded movies. It has spent the last six months paring the division to the bone, announcing in October that it would close Miramax's offices and lay off about 50 employees.
 The 20 or so people that remained were integrated into Walt Disney Studios, which took over Miramax's functions. Six Miramax films await release, including ''Last Night,'' a drama starring Keira Knightley, and ''The Baster,'' a romantic comedy starring Jennifer Aniston.
 The winnowing of operations most likely made the library and brand more attractive; any buyer would most certainly have imposed similar staff reductions. Disney renewed its efforts to sell Miramax as financing became more available and after it finished the $4 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment.
 Specialty labels like Miramax were originally intended to tap a growing market for cerebral, low-budget films as well as make their corporate owners competitive at the Oscars. But soaring marketing costs and a glut of art films dented the profitability and reliability of boutique divisions. Add in slumping DVD sales, and the economics became extremely difficult.
 Disney is in the middle of overhauling its movie operations, which lost money in the last two quarters. The company installed a new chairman in October and has since jettisoned over a dozen top managers, including its marketing and production executives.
 Disney has its moviemaking hands full. In addition to Pixar and its own brand, it now has Marvel and a distribution deal with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks production company to mine.

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; PRESCRIPTIONS MAKING SENSE OF THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 1001 words

HEADLINE: A Divide Separated By Common Ground

BYLINE: By DAVID HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The question-and-answer session between President Obama and House Republicans last week seemed to offer an unusually frank and refreshingly substantive debate, especially on the subject of health care. 
 Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee insisted that Republicans had many ideas on health care but that Democrats had refused to listen. 
 ''My question to you is: When will we look forward to starting anew and sitting down with you to put all of these ideas on the table?'' Ms. Blackburn asked. 
 But while the forum in Baltimore -- unscripted and broadcast live on television -- might have been new and different, a vast majority of ideas put forward by both parties in the health care debate are not. Many have been on the table for decades, debated year after year while Congress repeatedly failed to act and president after president came up short. 
 Consider an excerpt from the State of the Union address -- not last week's speech, but the one George W. Bushgave in 2005. 
 ''To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable and give families access to good coverage,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 ''I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda, with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need.'' 
 Or the State of the Union speech that Bill Clinton gave in 1993. ''All of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we take bold steps to reform our health care system,'' Mr. Clinton declared. ''The American people expect us to deal with health care. And we must deal with it now.'' 
 Here is President Richard M. Nixon, below, in the State of the Union address in 1974: ''The time is at hand this year to bring comprehensive, high-quality health care within the reach of every American. I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health insurance protection to millions of Americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it.'' 
 And President Harry S. Truman, above right, in 1949: ''We need -- and we must have without further delay -- a system of prepaid medical insurance which will enable every American to afford good medical care.'' 
 Mr. Obama, in his State of the Union address last week, noted that after generations of failure, Congress was closer than ever to adopting legislation that would achieve the health care goal of his predecessors. 
 ''If anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors and stop insurance company abuses, let me know,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, raised his left hand high in the air.
 Two days later, Mr. Boehner and his caucus challenged Mr. Obama during the televised question-and-answer session. With dramatic flair, they presented him with a book of Republican ''solutions,'' including a chapter on health care. 
 But the debate has raged for so long that there was not much new for Mr. Obama to contemplate. 
 For instance, a core component of the House Republicans' alternate health care measure -- to create so-called association health plans -- was also proposed in 2005 in response to Mr. Bush's speech. 
 House Republicans, who controlled the majority at the time, approved the bill but it died in the Senate, where Republicans were also in charge. The proposal, disliked by Democrats, was also criticized by conservatives as an intrusion by the government into health care. 
 Mr. Obama, in an exchange Friday with Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, said he had considered many Republican ideas and pointed, by example, to a proposal to allow insurance companies to sell policies across state lines. 
 ''We actually include that as part of our approach,'' the president said. ''But the caveat is, we've got to do so with some minimum standards; because otherwise what happens is that you could have insurance companies circumvent a whole bunch of state regulations.'' 
 After the session, Representative John Shadegg, Republican of Arizona, took issue with Mr. Obama's comments, saying the president ''got his facts wrong.''
 ''He insisted that his health care reform proposal would allow Americans to purchase insurance across state lines,'' Mr. Shadegg said. ''In reality, his bill nationalizes federal insurance regulation and gives the average American family no relief from expensive mandates that drive up the cost of health insurance.'' 
 But in a report comparing the health care bills passed by House and Senate Democrats, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote: ''Both bills would allow states to form compacts to facilitate the sale and purchase of health plans across state lines.'' 
 On a number of points, Republicans and Democrats are closer to agreement than many people realize. 
 For instance, the Senate health bill would allow adult children to remain on their parents' health plan until their 26th birthday, but the rule would apply only to new insurance policies. The House Democrats' bill would allow dependent coverage until the 27th birthday and the House Republicans' bill until the 25th, but both would apply the rule to existing policies. 
 The House Republicans' bill seeks to end annual and lifetime caps on benefits, as well as to ban ''recisions'' -- by which insurers cancel policies for seemingly arbitrary reasons. The Democrats' bills share those goals. 
 So there was not much new about Democrats and Republicans debating health care in Baltimore on Friday. What would be different? If they acknowledged their shared goals and agreed on a bipartisan solution.

HEADLINE: $100 Billion Increase In Deficit Is Forecast

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The additional tax cuts and public works spending that President Obama has proposed to spur job creation would add $100 billion to this year's deficit, bringing it to nearly $1.6 trillion, according to an administration official.
 A deficit of that size for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 would be about $150 billion greater than last year's deficit, which was the highest since World War II. 
 Measured against the size of the economy, a $1.6 trillion shortfall would equal almost 11 percent of the gross domestic product. Economists generally consider annual deficits above 3 percent to be unsustainable. 
 Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that this year's deficit would be more than $1.3 trillion without further spending or tax cuts. Mr. Obama's proposed $100 billion stimulus package, which includes tax credits for small businesses that make new hires and money for infrastructure projects, is less than a $154 billion package that the House approved in December but more than a measure the Senate is drafting.
 The administration's projection of its deficit for this year came as Mr. Obama prepared to release on Monday his budget for the 2011 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and for the remainder of the decade. 
 The president and his budget director, Peter R. Orszag, have signaled in recent weeks that the budget, after this year, will show the government on a path to lower deficits because of a combination of renewed economic growth and Mr. Obama's proposals for increasing tax revenues and cutting spending.
 The president's shift from stimulus spending to deficit reduction in his new budget for the 2011 to 2020 fiscal years assumes that the economy will have fully recovered from the worst recession in eight decades.
 It will rely on projections of higher tax collections from revived businesses and workers, and less spending for unemployment compensation and other safety-net programs for those out of work. 
 Budgets for 2011 and beyond also would save hundreds of billions of dollars by letting the Bush-era tax cuts for households that have annual incomes above $250,000 expire this year as scheduled. Mr. Obama's proposed tax on big banks, intended to recoup any losses from the financial bailout program, would collect at least $90 billion over a decade.
 An additional $250 billion would be saved by freezing for three years the overall spending for a portion of the domestic budget, and by holding that spending to the rate of inflation in subsequent years -- a level of austerity that has no modern precedent in Washington. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- the so-called entitlement programs that are the largest and fastest-growing part of the budget -- would be exempted, along with defense and veterans programs.
 The spending freeze is not an across-the-board cut, an approach that Mr. Obama opposed in his presidential campaign when his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, proposed it. Instead, officials said, they have taken ''a scalpel'' to cut or eliminate more than 120 programs, while increasing money for priorities -- chiefly education, research and energy programs -- to save about $20 billion in the 2011 fiscal year.
 Mr. Obama's budget for the coming fiscal year would total $3.8 trillion. Just $1.4 trillion is domestic and military spending that he and Congress directly control through annual appropriations; the rest is mostly automatic spending for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security and interest on debt of $12.4 trillion.
 In an unusual accompaniment to the budget that underscores the dire fiscal outlook, Mr. Obama will direct a bipartisan commission to recommend a plan to balance the budget, not counting growing payments on the country's amassed debt, by the 2015 fiscal year. Congressional Democratic leaders have committed to holding a vote in December on whatever plan such a commission produces.

HEADLINE: Obama Notwithstanding, Democrats Defend 'Messy' Lawmaking

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
A new element of tension has emerged between the Obama White House and Democratic leaders in Congress.
 It is not the president's continued demand for a health care overhaul, a priority the leaders share. Nor is it Mr. Obama's decision to call out liberals on the need for spending restraint in his State of the Union address.
 Rather it is the White House decision to spotlight unsavory legislative maneuvering as a cause of voter anger. Rather than the specifics of his health care policies, Obama aides argue, Americans reject back-room self-dealing by lawmakers and lobbyists. 
 ''A messy process,'' Mr. Obama acknowledged to House Republicans last week, referring to the health care fight. In his State of the Union speech, the president confessed, ''With all of the lobbying and horse trading, the process left most Americans wondering, 'What's in it for me?' ''
 Without the help of Republicans, Democratic leaders respond, that messy process is the only way to amass the votes needed to pass Mr. Obama's ambitious agenda. ''The American people don't care about process,'' Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, told journalists last week. 
 Her comments underscore the greatest contradiction within Mr. Obama's agenda -- not too many legislative priorities, but the difficulty of achieving them in the civics-textbook fashion he espouses.
 Bread, Butter and Pork
 Candidate Obama's pledge to change Washington, echoing reform-minded predecessors like Gary Hart and Bill Bradley, won applause from affluent Democrats and independents in the primaries. His rival Hillary Rodham Clinton countered by promising bread-and-butter benefits for working-class voters.
 As president, Mr. Obama has emphasized bread and butter. He accepted a budget bill with special-purpose ''earmarks,'' won a $787 billion stimulus package and put health care atop his crowded agenda.
 The way Congressional Democrats delivered for him created fat targets. Republicans attacked stimulus pork, favors for certain industries in the House energy bill and extra money for Louisiana and Nebraska to win their senators' backing on health care.
 In explaining their party's recent setback in Massachusetts, White House aides accepted that Republicans had a point. That acknowledgment reflected sentiment from an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week in which 84 percent of Americans agreed that ''special interests have too much influence over legislation.''
 ''We face a deficit of trust,'' Mr. Obama said in his State of the Union address. He exhorted Washington ''to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the government they deserve.''
 Down With Transparency
 Other Democrats question the role that Congressional deal-cutting is playing in the political storms of 2010. In California, like Massachusetts a hotbed of public discontent, ''public anger starts and finishes with the economy,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist.
 And it is hardly clear that more transparent bargaining will make things easier in a gridlocked capital that has shown scant ability to solve large national problems over the last generation.
 ''Ideas like televising negotiations are ridiculous,'' said Mr. Carrick, a longtime adviser to the former House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt. Though agreements should be well publicized before Congress acts, Mr. Carrick said, ''complex legislation has to be negotiated in private to succeed.''
 ''It makes the system work faster,'' said Vin Weber, a lobbyist and once a Republican firebrand in the House. He blames both parties for demonizing the process of governance itself. 
 Time is not on the Democrats' side. Congressional leaders have only months before midterm elections to finish a job-creation package, a health care overhaul, energy legislation, new financial industry regulations and the budget the Obama administration is unveiling on Monday. Amid 10 percent unemployment and mammoth federal deficits, Democrats crave tangible accomplishments.
 Mr. Obama faces a more forgiving calendar, since forecasters expect a healthier economy when he comes up for re-election in 2012. Yet he appears certain to have fewer Democratic allies in Congress in 2011 for any objectives he cannot achieve this year.
 That is why the White House and Democratic leaders -- despite complaints from Republicans and centrist Democrats -- continue backstage negotiations on an unorthodox plan for salvaging a comprehensive health care bill.
 Under the plan, the Senate-passed bill would become the principal legislative vehicle. But it would reach the House floor only after the completion of a ''sidecar'' House-Senate agreement on changes designed to pass using procedures barring a filibuster by a strengthened Senate Republican minority.
 Notwithstanding Mr. Obama's campaign pledge, Democratic leaders show no inclination to televise the negotiations on C-Span. A more fastidious process might be the president's stated priority -- not theirs.
 ''As I've said to my colleagues,'' Ms. Pelosi said, '' 'Go in the door. The door's locked? Go to the gate. The gate's locked? Climb over the over the fence.'
 '' 'It's too high? Pole vault in. That doesn't work? Parachute in.' We have to get this done for the American people,'' she concluded, ''one way or the other.''

HEADLINE: Risky Trading Wasn't Just on the Fringe at A.I.G.

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Ever since the American International Group nearly collapsed, the conventional wisdom has been that the exotic derivatives that drove it to the brink were the product of a lone, unregulated subsidiary in London. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, called the London branch ''a hedge fund, basically, attached to a large and stable insurance company.''
 But the suggestion that A.I.G.'s core insurance business did not dabble in derivatives is not quite true. One of its biggest insurance units, incorporated in Delaware, was also dealing in the derivatives known as credit-default swaps, according to regulatory filings with the state. 
 Though the Delaware division had a much smaller portfolio of those swaps than the London unit, and its portfolio did not pose a similar risk to the world financial system, the very presence of the swaps in a regulated insurance company points to a weakness in insurance oversight. 
 There is a continuing dispute over whether such swaps are insurance products or something else; who, if anyone, should regulate them; and whether insurers should have to set aside reserves to secure the promises that swap contracts make. A.I.G.'s insurance business did not set aside such reserves.
 Efforts afoot now in Washington to strengthen financial regulation tend to focus on banking, with insurance, which is regulated by the states, almost an afterthought. The Senate Banking Committee plans to consider a financial regulatory overhaul on Tuesday. The House has already passed a measure that would create a national office to gather information on insurance but would leave insurance regulation to the states. The bill does not treat credit-default swaps as a form of insurance.
 ''You have this blind spot on insurance companies,'' said Christopher Whalen, a co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics, a research firm. 
 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners says insurers were the third-biggest issuers of credit-default swaps, after banks and hedge funds, with 18 percent of the market in 2007. 
 ''We have a desperate need for federal regulation and federal disclosure by the insurance companies,'' Mr. Whalen said. ''But even after A.I.G., we still don't have a proposal for federal regulation, or even enhanced disclosure, and that's the dirty secret here.''
 Credit-default swaps, in essence, work like bond insurance, in which the issuer promises to make a bondholder whole in case of problems like a default. But the swaps differ from conventional insurance in important ways. There are no required reserves, for instance. And any institution can buy the swaps -- not just bondholders. 
 That has led critics to liken the use of swaps to buying insurance on a neighbor's house, in hopes of a payday when he has a fire. A.I.G.'s London branch used these swaps in huge volume, causing a disaster when the purchasers all descended at once, demanding payments, and A.I.G. ran out of money.
 The Delaware insurance unit with the credit-default swaps is one of A.I.G.'s biggest. Known as Alico, or the American Life Insurance Company, the unit does its conventional insurance business overseas in more than 40 countries. Its counterparties on the swaps, though, are big United States banking companies.
 If the measure passed by the House became law, an insurer like Alico that used swaps to sell protection against bond defaults would be designated a ''swap dealer,'' and have to comply with capital requirements and other rules. That way, the company would be required to have money to stand behind its promises, said Andrew Williams, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, which supports the provision.
 Insurance regulators said Delaware did not consider credit-default swaps to be insurance. 
 ''I don't think an insurance commissioner should tread on the toes of the banking industry,'' said Karen Weldin Stewart, the commissioner in Delaware. ''This started out as a bank product.''
 Her special deputy for examinations, John Tinsley, explained the reasoning. ''In insurance, you're putting together a pool,'' he said. Each customer would be charged a premium based on the total risk of the pool. 
 A credit-default swap cannot be insurance, Mr. Tinsley said, because it does not involve a pool. There is just one seller and one buyer for every contract. 
 ''It's an investment product,'' he said. ''It's closer to buying an option.'' 
 Not everyone agrees. Eric R. Dinallo, New York State's insurance superintendent when A.I.G. imploded, said he believed credit-default swaps were insurance and should be regulated as such. 
 Even at its peak, in 2007, Alico's portfolio of credit-default swaps was just a fraction of the one at A.I.G. Financial Products, the London shop whose collapsing business led the United States government to prop up A.I.G., the biggest bailout in American history. 
 If Alico's entire portfolio had blown up that year, the maximum possible loss -- a little more than $1 billion -- would not have wiped out the company's total reported surplus of $7 billion. 
 Alico's executives said they considered their swap program much safer as well. Michael Buthe, the chief investment officer, said that the company had sold protection only on investment-grade bonds, which the company considered unlikely to default. 
 Alico's chief financial officer, Christopher J. Swift, added that the bonds were issued by companies in many commercial sectors, which diversified the portfolio. That differed starkly from A.I.G. Financial Products, whose swaps gave A.I.G. a vast, undiversified exposure to the housing markets.
 ''This isn't tied to real estate,'' Mr. Swift said of his company's program. ''It diversified our holdings and increased yield.'' 
 When the markets soured in 2008, the company realized a $52 million loss as it terminated many of the contracts. ''We're constantly monitoring the market, and we saw the economics changing,'' Mr. Buthe said. 
 The program has been unwound, with only a few swaps remaining, and Mr. Buthe said the company was not planning to rebuild it.

HEADLINE: Thinking About a New Haiti

 BODY:
Three weeks after Haiti's earthquake, the search for survivors has been called off, the TV crews are trickling home, and the celebrity telethon is over -- usual signs that the floodwaters of compassion will be ebbing soon. The United States, Canada and other nations, meeting in Montreal last week, vowed that wouldn't happen. They began to map out a 10-year recovery plan and set the stage for a big donor conference in March. 
 Leaders there also acknowledged the difficult truth: It will take years of sustained help, and aid alone will never pour the foundation of a new Haiti. 
 In old Haiti there is still mostly horror. It is a nation of the homeless and maimed. Despite a stunning global surge of aid, many survivors still lack water, food and tents. Thousands sleep outdoors in Port-au-Prince, in terror of aftershocks. Roads, ports, communications -- all in terrible shape before -- are shattered. Managers and civil servants needed to help run the recovery are dead; the buildings they would run it from are flattened.
 And yet there are reasons for optimism in the rubble. Well before the quake, experts like Paul Collier, an Oxford economist who was a special adviser on Haiti to the United Nations, were disseminating sensible proposals for rebuilding Haiti. The quake altered the landscape but not the validity of these ideas. 
 Here are a few that donor countries and Haitian leaders should take a hard look at in coming weeks:
 PROMOTE SELF-SUFFICIENCY Professor Collier has noted that Haiti has considerable economic advantages, like low labor costs and a law that grants its goods preferential access to the United States market. Extending that law and encouraging investments in industries like garment-making and tourism could swiftly create tens of thousands of jobs. Rebuilding and modernizing agriculture to grow staples and export products like coffee and mangoes would mean food, cash and employment. 
 OPEN UP THE COUNTRYSIDE Dispersing the population beyond overbuilt, overburdened cities, like the now-shattered capital, is a good idea now cloaked in urgency. Haitians need to get out of disaster-prone areas, and well-placed development could enable them to lead sustainable lives in rural areas and new small towns instead of as the huddled, jobless urban poor. They also need help with tree-planting and topsoil restoration projects, which could create jobs and begin to undo the profound environmental damage that has left the countryside so impoverished and vulnerable to natural disasters. 
 REBUILD (AND MAINTAIN) INFRASTRUCTURE Haiti obviously needs homes, schools, roads, a reliable power system -- but it also needs the money to maintain them, instead of the usual practice of building projects and leaving them to rot. Technology offers hope here, too. Instead of waiting for someone to build an expensive, centralized power grid, donors could think more flexibly on a smaller scale, using solar panels and LEDs to provide electricity and light cheaply, portably and quickly.
 TAP THE DIASPORA Haitian immigrants in the United States, Canada and elsewhere already send home hundreds of millions of dollars every year. They surely will be sending more, now that the Obama administration has wisely, if belatedly, granted temporary protected status to undocumented Haitians in the United States. Haitians in Canada proposed another excellent idea: government-paid leaves of absence to allow expatriates (employed in government or the private sector) to return and rebuild civil society in their place of birth. 
 In a country scarredby endemic corruption and waste, relief funds and projects need to be carefully monitored. Those who know Haiti well note that in the years before this latest disaster, civil order had already begun to take root. President Rene Preval is far more capable than his predecessors, although we wish he would be a lot more visible to his own people and a lot more assertive. Haiti needs strong and honest leadership.
 Expert analysts like Jocelyn McCallan, a Haitian-American development consultant, noted an encouraging upswelling of political good will and common purpose after the devastating hurricanes of 2008. This, he says, helps explain why Haitians have endured these horrific weeks with relative calm.
 It will take a lot of money, creativity, and vigilance and sustained commitment to rebuild Haiti -- from Haitians and from the world. There are smart people thinking about how to do it. And that is a start.

HEADLINE: Good And Boring

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In times of crisis, good news is no news. Iceland's meltdown made headlines; the remarkable stability of Canada's banks, not so much.
 Yet as the world's attention shifts from financial rescue to financial reform, the quiet success stories deserve at least as much attention as the spectacular failures. We need to learn from those countries that evidently did it right. And leading that list is our neighbor to the north. Right now, Canada is a very important role model.
 Yes, I know, Canada is supposed to be dull. The New Republic famously pronounced ''Worthwhile Canadian Initiative'' (from a Times Op-Ed column in the '80s) the world's most boring headline. But I've always considered Canada fascinating, precisely because it's similar to the United States in many but not all ways. The point is that when Canadian and U.S. experience diverge, it's a very good bet that policy differences, rather than differences in culture or economic structure, are responsible for that divergence. 
 And anyway, when it comes to banking, boring is good.
 First, some background. Over the past decade the United States and Canada faced the same global environment. Both were confronted with the same flood of cheap goods and cheap money from Asia. Economists in both countries cheerfully declared that the era of severe recessions was over.
 But when things fell apart, the consequences were very different here and there. In the United States, mortgage defaults soared, some major financial institutions collapsed, and others survived only thanks to huge government bailouts. In Canada, none of that happened. What did the Canadians do differently?
 It wasn't interest rate policy. Many commentators have blamed the Federal Reserve for the financial crisis, claiming that the Fed created a disastrous bubble by keeping interest rates too low for too long. But Canadian interest rates have tracked U.S. rates quite closely, so it seems that low rates aren't enough by themselves to produce a financial crisis.
 Canada's experience also seems to refute the view, forcefully pushed by Paul Volcker, the formidable former Fed chairman, that the roots of our crisis lay in the scale and scope of our financial institutions -- in the existence of banks that were ''too big to fail.'' For in Canada essentially all the banks are too big to fail: just five banking groups dominate the financial scene. 
 On the other hand, Canada's experience does seem to support the views of people like Elizabeth Warren, the head of the Congressional panel overseeing the bank bailout, who place much of the blame for the crisis on failure to protect consumers from deceptive lending. Canada has an independent Financial Consumer Agency, and it has sharply restricted subprime-type lending.
 Above all, Canada's experience seems to support those who say that the way to keep banking safe is to keep it boring -- that is, to limit the extent to which banks can take on risk. The United States used to have a boring banking system, but Reagan-era deregulation made things dangerously interesting. Canada, by contrast, has maintained a happy tedium.
 More specifically, Canada has been much stricter about limiting banks' leverage, the extent to which they can rely on borrowed funds. It has also limited the process of securitization, in which banks package and resell claims on their loans outstanding -- a process that was supposed to help banks reduce their risk by spreading it, but has turned out in practice to be a way for banks to make ever-bigger wagers with other people's money.
 There's no question that in recent years these restrictions meant fewer opportunities for bankers to come up with clever ideas than would have been available if Canada had emulated America's deregulatory zeal. But that, it turns out, was all to the good.
 So what are the chances that the United States will learn from Canada's success? 
 Actually, the financial reform bill that the House of Representatives passed in December would significantly Canadianize the U.S. system. It would create an independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency, it would establish limits on leverage, and it would limit securitization by requiring that lenders hold on to some of their loans. 
 But prospects for a comparable bill getting the 60 votes now needed to push anything through the Senate are doubtful. Republicans are clearly dead set against any significant financial reform -- not a single Republican voted for the House bill -- and some Democrats are ambivalent, too.
 So there's a good chance that we'll do nothing, or nothing much, to prevent future banking crises. But it won't be because we don't know what to do: we've got a clear example of how to keep banking safe sitting right next door.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths JOFFE, ROBERT D

 BODY:
JOFFE--Robert D. All the lawyers and staff of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP mourn the loss of their partner Bob Joffe, a friend and mentor who was a preeminent litigator and boardroom adviser. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife and family to whom he was so devoted. Mr. Joffe was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August 2009 and died in New York, NY on January 28. He was 66 years old. Over the course of his extraordinary career, Mr. Joffe was well- known nationally and internationally, both for his tenacity in handling landmark litigation and for his ability to provide highly sensitive counsel in the boardrooms of corporate America. 
Since 1978, Mr. Joffe was the primary outside lawyer for Time Warner. One of the many significant matters he handled was the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. He was the principal litigator for Time Inc. in successfully rebutting Paramount's 1989 attempted takeover in a case considered to be a milestone in M&A litigation. Mr. Joffe represented the Boards of Directors of some of the world's most prominent companies in connection with their most pressing challenges, especially during the recent financial crisis. He was a longtime advisor to the non-management directors of Fannie Mae and was also counsel to the independent directors of Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, General Electric and General Motors, among many others. Mr. Joffe was passionate about human rights even as a student at Harvard Law School. From 1967 to 1969, after just a few months as a Cravath associate, Mr. Joffe left New York to serve in the Ministry of Justice of the Government of Malawi on an Africa Asia Public Service Fellowship funded by the Ford Foundation. It was in this position that he assisted the Commissioner for Law Revision in rewriting the country's laws and instituting a framework for supervision of the local courts for this African country. He continued his interest in civil rights and, in 1989, he argued Martin v. Wilks, a pro bono civil rights case in the United States Supreme Court in which he represented black and women municipal employees in Birmingham, Alabama, in an effort to secure equal opportunity in employment. In later years, as Cravath's Presiding Partner, Mr. Joffe was a strong promoter of the need for lawyers to treat pro bono clients with equal regard and concern as they would any paying client. Mr. Joffe became a partner at Cravath in 1975. He was elected Deputy Presiding Partner in 1997 and became Cravath's Presiding Partner in 1999. Mr. Joffe served as the Firm's leader until December 31, 2006. Mr. Joffe was a beloved and devoted husband, father and son. He is survived by his wife Virginia (Dinny), two children, Katherine Joffe (New York, NY) and David Joffe (New York, NY) and two stepchildren, Dr. Ryan DeHaas (Concord, NC) and Elizabeth DeHass (New York, NY), and two grandchildren. He is also survived by his mother, Bertha Joffe, and two brothers, Paul Joffe (Washington, DC) and Richard Joffe (New York, NY). A memorial service will be held to celebrate his life on Wednesday, February 10th at 11am at All Souls Church, 1157 Lexington Ave. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Human Rights First, 333 Seventh Ave., 13th Floor, New York, NY 10001 or to The After-School Corporation, 1440 Broadway, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10018.

HEADLINE: So, Virginia, What's the Story?

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A campaign now under way is asking consumers to consider something revolutionary in this economy: spending money on leisure travel.
 The campaign is for Colonial Williamsburg, the venerable attraction that recreates life in 18th-century Virginia. The campaign, with a budget estimated at $6 million to $8 million, carries the theme ''Be part of the story.''
 The campaign is the first work from the new lead agency for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the Birmingham, Mich., office of McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The assignment had previously been handled by the Arlington, Va., office of Arnold Worldwide, a unit of Havas.
 Why would a living history museum in Virginia forgo working with a home-state agency to hire one in the industrial Midwest? The primary appeal was the success of a campaign created by the McCann Erickson office, which promotes Michigan as a destination for winter sports, leaf-peeping in the fall and other leisure travel. 
 The ''Pure Michigan'' campaign, with commercials that feature of the voice of the comedian -- and Michigan native -- Tim Allen, has been widely deemed one of the most effective efforts of its kind these days in generating tourism dollars. The idea is that if McCann Erickson can sell Michigan as a place to visit, it might well have the Midas touch when it comes to leisure-travel marketing.
 ''We thought their Michigan advertisements were really terrific,'' says Colin Campbell, president and chief executive of the foundation, based in what is called the historic area of Williamsburg.
 McCann Erickson is handling the creative and media duties for the campaign. Three other agencies are also involved: Ypartnership in Orlando, Fla., a specialist in travel advertising, which is handling mobile marketing; Brains on Fire in Greenville, S.C., for social media; and Mfa Public Relations and Marketing in New York, which is handling a public relations initiative.
 The new campaign replaces one from Arnold that carried the theme ''History is just the beginning.'' The previous ads were ''designed to say, 'There is so much to do in Williamsburg,' '' Mr. Campbell says. ''Whether it got that message across is another question.''
 The rethinking of how Colonial Williamsburg is being pitched to potential visitors was undertaken because ''simply put, times have changed,'' Mr. Campbell says, citing ''a recessionary atmosphere'' with ''a decline in discretionary spending.''
 That led to a decline in admissions at Colonial Williamsburg, he adds, reversing a gain that had been achieved in the latter part of the 2000s.
 To determine the new course for the foundation's ads, research was undertaken to see what tourists are ''looking for and concerned about regarding their vacation dollars,'' Mr. Campbell, as well as to see ''which media they rely on to make their decisions.''
 What people revealed they are looking for is ''engagement, interaction,'' he adds, and Colonial Williamsburg was ''essentially perceived to be passive -- and passive is not we want to be or need to be.''
 ''With 'Be part of the story,' it's clear there is an active role for the visitor,'' Mr. Campbell says. ''That proactive approach is the key change.''
 For instance, in a television commercial, an announcer declares: ''The people who walked these streets before us were just like you and me, with hopes, dreams, challenges. Today we do more than just walk the same streets. For a moment, we get to walk in their shoes, preparing us for what lies ahead down our next road.''
 The spot begins with scenes of costumed employees of Colonial Williamsburg on Duke of Gloucester Street. Visitors are added to the picture in scenes that include employees dressed as soldiers; some visitors are firing guns, others are bowing, 18th-century style. ''Be part of the story,'' the announcer concludes.
 That concept is echoed in a print advertisement showing a man in a tri-cornered hat driving a horse-drawn wagon and a boy rolling a hoop, which carries this headline: ''250 Years Later, We're Still Traveling the Same Roads.''
 ''We turn a corner and suddenly find ourselves in another place and time,'' the text of the ad begins. ''Not simply strolling down the streets of the people who lived in colonial America. But walking in their shoes.''
 ''Reliving their adventures, dramas, victories and defeats in ways that are as engaging as they are entertaining,'' the text says. ''Experiences that stay with us. And help guide us down new streets of our own.''
 The ad ends by inviting readers to ''Be part of the story'' and visit a Web site.
 A second television commercial starts with scenes of the doors of buildings in Colonial Williamsburg like the Williamsburg Inn, along with employees in costumes. ''We go through them all the time,'' the announcer says. ''Doors that mark the day's events, new beginnings, endings, routines.''
 The doors reveal ''the stories and dramas, the victories and challenges that help us go through new doors of our own,'' the announcer continues, as scenes appear on screen of visitors speaking with the employees. This spot, too, ends with the announcer concluding, ''Be part of the story.''
 There is also a radio commercial that is focused on what the announcer calls ''words that we use so casually today.''
 They are ''the same words,'' he says, ''that 250 years ago in Williamsburg, Va., helped change the course of history forever.''
 Those words include ''freedom,'' ''independence'' and ''revolution,'' the announcer continues, adding: ''Let's make words like these come alive and perhaps inspire us to find words of our own that will make a difference in the world we live in.''
 With ''all the options for people to spend their vacation dollars,'' says Charlie Metzger, executive vice president and director for client services at the McCann Erickson office, ''it is, no question, competitive'' -- not to mention ''a challenge'' to draw attention to a single attraction.
 The research for the campaign included convening focus groups as well as talking to people who visit Colonial Williamsburg and like to blog about their experiences, he adds, as well as discussions with employees.
 ''We did a lot of listening,'' Mr. Metzger says, which elicited ''a feeling that this is a unique place with something more there -- a depth, a richness, an authenticity -- that we frankly felt hadn't been told in previous communications.''
 ''This is a vacation, a destination, where you've got to give a little bit to get something,'' Mr. Metzger says. ''And those who do get a huge amount out of it.''
 So the intent of the campaign is ''to let people know this is an interactive experience,'' he adds.
 Another reason for replacing ''History is just the beginning,'' Mr. Metzger says, is that it can come across as ''apologetic.''
 Although visitors can shop, play golf or be pampered at spas, ''what makes Colonial Williamsburg so rich, so authentic, is the historic attractions,'' he adds. ''That is the driver.''
 In addition to encouraging travelers to visit Colonial Williamsburg for the first time, Mr. Metzger says, the campaign seeks to ''reach out to those who have been there previously.''
 ''Research told us the average visitor hadn't been back in seven years,'' he adds, so the ads will try to tap into ''some latent equity'' in those former guests and remind them ''they should put us back in their consideration set.''
 The campaign's television and radio commercials and print ads are aimed at residents of the Eastern Seaboard, Mr. Metzger says, for whom Virginia is nearby and thus a lower-cost alternative to more far-flung destinations.
 There are also online ads, which Mr. Campbell says will be more extensive than before, along with e-mail marketing, blogs, an iPhone application and the forays into social media.
 Social media are ''a wonderful way to make contact'' with potential visitors, Mr. Campbell says, because ''the best marketing is a great experience'' that is conveyed through word of mouth.
 Indeed, there was social media of a sort back in the 18th century: coffeehouses.

HEADLINE: Smaller Banks Don't Need Aid

BYLINE: By ROB COX and ROLFE WINKLER

 BODY:
President Obama's speeches suggest he doesn't dislike all banks, just the big ones. Even though he used much of his State of the Union address last week to bash Wall Street and the money business, he threw a bone to the community banking sector. He pledged to divert $30 billion of money repaid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to smaller banks to help them make loans to small businesses.
 Sounds good, doesn't it? After all, small businesses are the backbone of American employment. Giving them access to capital should help them invest and hire more people. And small banks, it would appear, are the most effective conduit for providing capital to small businesses. 
 According to the Independent Community Bankers Association, the primary lobbying group for the nation's 8,000 smaller banks, institutions with less than $1 billion in assets hold only 12 percent of all bank assets but have made 40 percent of the small business loans currently outstanding. Big banks -- those with $100 billion or more in assets -- made only 22 percent of such loans.
 So Mr. Obama's idea sounds logical. But there are problems that would probably make any plan that the White House proposes both unworkable and bad for taxpayers. 
 First, community banks don't need the money. While the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regularly has to close down troubled small banks (including five on Friday), in aggregate, the industry is relatively flush. In the third quarter, banks with assets of less than $5 billion on average had tangible common equity equal to 9.62 percent of tangible assets. That's a stronger capital position than big banks, whose equivalent ratio stood at just 7.97 percent on average, according to SNL Financial. 
 Moreover, small banks appear to be hoarding the money they do have, lending out just 82 percent of their deposits. That's a lower loan-to-deposit ratio than the 91 percent at big banks. And it may not be their fault: the Federal Reserve's survey of loan officers released in October suggested that 35 percent of domestic banks were experiencing weaker demand for loans from smaller companies.
 But even if that were to change, small banks are unlikely to accept bailout cash without major changes to the way the program has been administered so far. 
 Since the smaller banks don't really need the money, Paul Merski, the chief economist for the Independent Community Bankers Association, says they would want some conditions removed. Among the concessions they would expect are lower dividend payments to the government on any capital it lent them, no stock warrants attached to the investment, and no restrictions on executive pay.
 These strings attached to the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout were safeguards the Treasury imposed to protect taxpayer money. The Treasury invested $205 billion in 707 banks, receiving senior preferred stock or other securities. To date these have generated a 3.1 percent absolute return. Fold in the sale of warrants the Treasury received over stock in 34 of the banks and the return jumps to 8.8 percent.
 Relaxing the requirements of the program rules would seem at odds with the president's other objectives of reducing debt and closing the yawning budget deficit. It's also not clear the Treasury could simply waive conditions without an act of Congress, where members may be disinclined to sanction another banking initiative financed by taxpayers. 
 The government could still try to ease the flow of money to small businesses in other ways. It could set up an entity to buy small-business loans from community and other banks, and then sell them on to investors. 
 This was the idea behind the Venture Enhancement and Loan Development Administration for Smaller Undercapitalized Enterprises, also known as Velda Sue, but that proposal never got off the ground. 
 The troubled experience of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which play a similar role on a huge scale for mortgages, suggests that plan isn't so good, either. Indeed, add up all the elements -- slack demand for small-business loans, banks already flush with money and the potential for taxpayer losses -- and the conclusion seems clear.
 The latest proposal to subsidize banks, even small ones, makes great political fodder. In any event, it's a bad idea.

HEADLINE: Sex Ed in Washington

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Liberals hated almost everything about George W. Bush's presidency, but they harbored a particular animus toward a minor domestic policy priority: abstinence-based sex education. The abstinence effort accounted for about a hundred million dollars in a trillion-dollar budget, but in the eyes of many critics it was Bushism at its worst -- contemptuous of experts, careless about public health and captive to religious conservatism.
 So last week's news that teenage birthrates inched upward late in the Bush era, after 15 years of steady decline, was greeted with a grim sort of satisfaction. Bloggers pounced; activists claimed vindication. On CBS News, Katie Couric used the occasion to lecture viewers about the perils of telling kids only about abstinence, and ignoring contraception. The new numbers, declared the president of Planned Parenthood, make it ''crystal clear that abstinence-only sex education for teenagers does not work.'' 
 In reality, the numbers show no such thing. Abstinence financing increased under Bush, but the federal government has been funneling money to pro-chastity initiatives since early in Bill Clinton's presidency. If you blame abstinence programs for a year's worth of bad news, you'd also have to give them credit for more than a decade's worth of progress.
 More likely, neither blame nor credit is appropriate. The evidence suggests that many abstinence-only programs have little impact on teenage sexual behavior, just as their critics long insisted. But most sex education programs of any kind have an ambiguous effect, at best, on whether and how teens have sex. The abstinence-based courses that social conservatives champion produce unimpressive results -- but so do the contraceptive-oriented programs that liberals tend to favor.
 In ''When Sex Goes to School,'' her thoughtful history of the sex education debate, the sociologist Kristin Luker concluded that it is ''surprisingly difficult to show that sex education programs do in fact increase teenagers' willingness to protect themselves from pregnancy and/or disease.'' This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's attended high school. What is taught in the classroom is vastly less important than the matrix of family, culture and economics: the values parents impart and the example that they set, the friends teenagers make and the activities they join, and the cross-cutting effects of wealth, health and self-esteem. (And, of course, the impact of entertainment: the MTV reality show ''Teen Mom'' is far more absorbing than the average sex-ed curriculum, and probably more influential as well.)
 Predictably, the rare initiatives that show impressive results tend to be defined more by their emphasis on building social capital than by their insistence on either chastity or contraception. A 2001 survey published by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, for instance, found that ''most studies of school-based and school-linked health centers revealed no effect on student sexual behavior or contraceptive use.'' The exceptions included an abstinence-oriented program with a strong community-service requirement, and a comprehensive program that essentially provided life coaching as well as sex ed: participants were offered ''academic support (e.g., tutoring); employment; self-expression through the arts; sports; and health care.''
 None of this renders the abstinence-versus-contraception debate pointless. But we should understand it more as a battle over community values than as an argument about public policy. Luker describes it, aptly, as a conflict between the ''naturalist'' and ''sacralist'' approaches to sex -- between parents in Berkeley, say, who don't want their kids being taught that premarital intercourse is something to feel ashamed about and parents in Alabama who don't want their kids being lectured about the health benefits of masturbation.
 The debate might be less rancorous if the naturalists and sacralists didn't have to fight it out in Washington. This is the real problem with federal financing for abstinence-based education: It drags the national government into a debate that should remain intensely local. 
 We federalize the culture wars all the time, of course -- from Roe v. Wade to the Defense of Marriage Act. But it's a polarizing habit, and well worth kicking. 
 If the federal government wants to invest in the fight against teenage pregnancy, the funds should be available to states and localities without any ideological strings attached. (And yes, this goes for the dollars that currently flow to Planned Parenthood as well as the money that supports abstinence programs.) Don't try to encourage Berkeley values in Alabama, or vice versa.
 America's competing visions of sexuality -- permissive and traditional, naturalist and sacralist -- have been in conflict since the 1960s. They'll probably be in conflict for generations yet to come. 
 But as long as they are, it shouldn't be Washington's job to choose between them.

HEADLINE: Raise High the P.R. Blitz

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FINNEY BOYLAN. 
Jennifer Finney Boylan is a professor of English at Colby College and the author of the forthcoming young adult novel, ''Falcon Quinn and the Black Mirror.''

DATELINE: Belgrade Lakes, Me. 

 BODY:
 THE national bereavement over the death of J. D. Salinger provided a strangely public moment in the career of a writer who'd become best known, in recent years, for his reclusiveness. There are other American writers famous for shunning the public eye -- Thomas Pynchon leaps to mind -- but Mr. Salinger's seclusion was unique. By the end of his life, he may have become better known for his solitude than for his imagination.
 In a way, nothing succeeds like invisibility. In America, we revere artists who won't do the thing they're famous for. We revere Glenn Gould, who gave up performing; Greta Garbo, who gave up acting; and Michael Jordan, who not only gave up basketball (at which he was gifted), but then, perversely, took up baseball (at which he was not). 
 The more steadfastly they refuse us, the more infuriatingly desirable they become, like that boy we just know loves us but who cannot bring himself to call. How can the satirist Tom Lehrer, who long ago gave up performing music for teaching mathematics, not miss writing songs like ''Poisoning Pigeons in the Park''? (Whenever he's asked when he will return to his musical career, Mr. Lehrer likes to reply, ''Oh, did hell freeze over?'')
 ''There is a marvelous peace in not publishing,'' Mr. Salinger told The Times in 1974. ''Publishing is a terrible invasion of my privacy.... I love to write. But I write just for myself and my own pleasure.''
 As a teacher of writing, I frequently hear young authors echo Mr. Salinger's words, that they're writing primarily to satisfy themselves. It's hard to disagree with that on the surface; writing can be great fun. But to create fiction -- or nonfiction, for that matter -- without any thought of a reader seems creepy to me, the ultimate exercise in self-indulgence. 
 Of course, we all yearn to live in that kind of self-contained world, now and again. There is plenty to envy about an imaginative universe detached from the world of commerce. Writing just for oneself and one's own pleasure? Nice work if you can get it. 
 What I suspect, though, is that fame through invisibility may well belong to a generation that is passing, or passed. 
 In contemporary America, a writer's life is more than just the endless, thankless task of writing itself, which E. B. White is said to have called ''hard work and bad for the health.'' There is also the humiliating, cringe-inducing necessity of becoming a public person, of book tours and radio interviews and, if you're extremely lucky (as I was), a trip to Oprah's couch (or in my case, four).
 There were a lot of things on my mind when I wrote ''She's Not There,'' my memoir of being transgender, during a particularly cold Maine winter, but the green room of the ''Today'' Show wasn't one of them. Yet there I was, a year or two later, with the actress Lucy Liu looking over at me and saying: ''I have a new movie. What are you on for?'' 
 ''Sex change,'' I said, and wondered how it was that I had wound up in this situation. Was this what it means now, to be a person of letters? Discussing one's genitalia with an actress from ''Charlie's Angels''?
 When J. D. Salinger disappeared, invisibility was still a perfectly viable -- if enigmatic -- way to be a successful literary figure in America. But now that the desperate economics of publishing more or less demand that ''public relations'' become part of a writer's professional toolkit, being a recluse is a harder stunt to pull off. In order to sustain their careers, plenty of shy, awkward authors -- people who chose this profession for the very reason that it's fundamentally a private activity -- have sacrificed their solitude for Web sites, blogs, Twitter accounts and videos of themselves on YouTube. Somehow, these items weren't on the syllabus in John Barth's class at Johns Hopkins. 
 I've always thought of encountering readers -- of having any readers at all -- as an unbelievable gift. Giving lectures, signing books, sitting hopefully behind a table at a bookstore in Wichita Falls: these rituals may be humbling, but I've never forgotten the fact that thousands of unpublished writers in this country would give anything to be humiliated in exactly this way. Of all the mortifications to be found in an author's life, probably none hurts as much as the kind you get from not being able to share your work with another soul.
 In ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' Holden Caulfield famously observes, ''What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours.'' What was sad and strange about J. D. Salinger is not that he didn't want to be our terrific friend. It's that, at the pinnacle of his fame, he yearned for the very thing many writers fear most -- a world without readers.

HEADLINE: Rules Worth Following, for Everyone's Sake

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
In the more than four decades that I have been reading and writing about the findings of nutritional science, I have come across nothing more intelligent, sensible and simple to follow than the 64 principles outlined in a slender, easy-to-digest new book called ''Food Rules: An Eater's Manual,'' by Michael Pollan.
 Mr. Pollan is not a biochemist or a nutritionist but rather a professor of science journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. You may recognize his name as the author of two highly praised books on food and nutrition, ''In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto'' and ''The Omnivore's Dilemma.'' (All three books are from Penguin.) 
 If you don't have the time and inclination to read the first two, you can do yourself and your family no better service than to invest $11 and one hour to whip through the 139 pages of ''Food Rules'' and adapt its guidance to your shopping and eating habits. 
 Chances are you've heard any number of the rules before. I, for one, have been writing and speaking about them for decades. And chances are you've yet to put most of them into practice. But I suspect that this little book, which is based on research but not annotated, can do more than the most authoritative text to get you motivated to make some important, lasting, health-promoting and planet-saving changes in what and how you eat.
 Reasons to Change
 Two fundamental facts provide the impetus Americans and other Westerners need to make dietary changes. One, as Mr. Pollan points out, is that populations who rely on the so-called Western diet -- lots of processed foods, meat, added fat, sugar and refined grains -- ''invariably suffer from high rates of the so-called Western diseases: obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.'' Indeed, 4 of the top 10 killers of Americans are linked to this diet.
 As people in Asian and Mediterranean countries have become more Westernized (affluent, citified and exposed to the fast foods exported from the United States), they have become increasingly prone to the same afflictions.
 The second fact is that people who consume traditional diets, free of the ersatz foods that line our supermarket shelves, experience these diseases at much lower rates. And those who, for reasons of ill health or dietary philosophy, have abandoned Western eating habits often experience a rapid and significant improvement in their health indicators.
 I will add a third reason: our economy cannot afford to continue to patch up the millions of people who each year develop a diet-related ailment, and our planetary resources simply cannot sustain our eating style and continue to support its ever-growing population. 
 In his last book, Mr. Pollan summarized his approach in just seven words: ''Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.'' The new book provides the practical steps, starting with advice to avoid ''processed concoctions,'' no matter what the label may claim (''no trans fats,'' ''low cholesterol,'' ''less sugar,'' ''reduced sodium,'' ''high in antioxidants'' and so forth). 
 As Mr. Pollan puts it, ''If it came from a plant, eat it; if it was made in a plant, don't.''
 Do you already avoid products made with high-fructose corn syrup? Good, but keep in mind, sugar is sugar, and if it is being added to a food that is not normally sweetened, avoid it as well. Note, too, that refined flour is hardly different from sugar once it gets into the body.
 Also avoid foods advertised on television, imitation foods and food products that make health claims. No natural food is simply a collection of nutrients, and a processed food stripped of its natural goodness to which nutrients are then added is no bargain for your body.
 Those who sell the most healthful foods -- vegetables, fruits and whole grains -- rarely have a budget to support national advertising. If you shop in a supermarket (and Mr. Pollan suggests that wherever possible, you buy fresh food at farmers' markets), shop the periphery of the store and avoid the center aisles laden with processed foods. Note, however, that now even the dairy case has been invaded by products like gunked-up yogurts.
 Follow this advice, and you will have to follow another of Mr. Pollan's rules: ''Cook.'' 
 ''Cooking for yourself,'' he writes, ''is the only sure way to take back control of your diet from the food scientists and food processors.'' Home cooking need not be arduous or very time-consuming, and you can make up time spent at the stove with time saved not visiting doctors or shopping for new clothes to accommodate an expanding girth.
 Although the most wholesome eating pattern consists of three leisurely meals a day, and preferably a light meal at night, if you must have snacks, stick to fresh and dried fruits, vegetables and nuts, which are naturally loaded with healthful nutrients. I keep a dish of raisins and walnuts handy to satisfy the urge to nibble between meals. I also take them along for long car trips. Feel free to use the gas-station restroom, but never ''get your fuel from the same place your car does,'' Mr. Pollan writes.
 Treating Treats as Treats
 Perhaps the most important rules to put into effect as soon as possible are those aimed at the ever-expanding American waistline. If you eat less, you can afford to pay more for better foods, like plants grown in organically enriched soil and animals that are range-fed.
 He recommends that you do all your eating at a table, not at a desk, while working, watching television or driving. If you're not paying attention to what you're eating, you're likely to eat more than you realize.
 But my favorite tip, one that helped me keep my weight down for decades, is a mealtime adage, ''Stop eating before you're full'' -- advice that has long been practiced by societies as diverse as Japan and France. (There is no French paradox, by the way: the French who stay slim eat smaller portions, leisurely meals and no snacks.)
 Practice portion control and eat slowly to the point of satiation, not fullness. The food scientists Barbara J. Rolls of Penn State and Brian Wansink of Cornell, among others, have demonstrated that people eat less when served smaller portions on smaller plates. ''There is nothing wrong with special occasion foods, as long as every day is not a special occasion,'' Mr. Pollan writes. ''Special occasion foods offer some of the great pleasures of life, so we shouldn't deprive ourselves of them, but the sense of occasion needs to be restored.'' 
 Here is where I can make an improvement. Ice cream has been a lifelong passion, and even though I stick to a brand lower in fat and calories than most, and limit my portion to the half-cup serving size described on the container, I indulge in this treat almost nightly. Perhaps I'll try the so-called S policy Mr. Pollan says some people follow: ''No snacks, no seconds, no sweets -- except on days that begin with the letter S.''

HEADLINE: Economies in Asia Continue to Show Strong Rebound

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
A range of economic data released on Monday underscored the Asia-Pacific region's rebound from the global turmoil of last year, but also highlighted the challenges facing governments as they sought to solidify that growth while reining in nascent inflation.
 With the exception of Japan, the region has powered ahead since mid-2009 as stimulus measures took hold and the collapse in global demand began to bottom out. 
 Data from China, India and South Korea showed that the trend continued into 2010, despite recent efforts by officials in Beijing to restrict some of the vast bank lending that helped drive the country's economic rebound last year.
 Two purchasing managers indexes for China showed manufacturing activity there continued to expand in January: a reading by Markit Economics and HSBC rose to a record of 57.4, from 56.1 in December, while a government-backed index came in at 55.8, also well above 50, which separates expansion from contraction.
 Similarly, an index for India rose to 57.6 last month, compared with 55.6 in December. And in South Korea, exports in January were up 47.1 percent from a year earlier, data published on Monday showed.
 By comparison, the Markit Economics' purchasing managers index for the euro zone rose to 52.4 in January, from 51.6 in December, illustrating how the recovery in that region was lagging behind much of Asia.
 But the statistics from Asia also contained new reminders that policy makers faced a delicate balancing act as they begin to scale back some of the extraordinary stimulus measures put in place during the financial crisis.
 In China, the official purchasing managers index reading for January was actually down slightly from December, and the export figures from South Korea fell short of what economists had expected. This highlights how the recovery in demand -- including that from the United States -- still has some distance to go.
 South Korea's export growth should pick up in February, analysts at Barclays Capital commented in a note. But ''given the bumpy nature of the ride so far,'' they added ''we believe the government is in no hurry to normalize its expansionary policies.''
 In other words, a rise in interest rates, of perhaps a quarter of a percentage point, is unlikely before March at the earliest, the Barclays team and many other economists believe.
 The authorities in China, too, have to tread carefully: On one hand, they want to clamp down on lending by state-controlled banks, as that has been partly responsible for rapid rises in property prices.
 On the other hand, reduced lending or higher interest rates could risk choking off growth if done too precipitously.
 The government's moves to restrict loan growth have also worried stock market investors, contributing to a pronounced sell-off in China and elsewhere over the last two weeks. 
 ''Industrial activity continues to accelerate, implying stronger G.D.P. growth in the first quarter,'' commented Qu Hongbin, China economist at HSBC, in a note accompanying the HSBC P.M.I. index. ''But rising input and output prices also point to greater inflationary pressure, which will likely prompt more tightening measures in the coming months.''
 So far, such measures have focused on curtailing the banks' discretion in extending credit rather than on raising interest rates.
 A report published by the state-run Xinhua News Agency on Monday indicated that Chinese banks significantly slowed lending in the second half of January.
 Similarly, India's central bank last week told banks to keep more cash in reserve. But it left interest rates unchanged, amid nervousness that an outright rate increase could stifle growth.
 Still, most governments in the Asia-Pacific region are months ahead of the rest of the world in scaling back the stimulus drives of 2008 and 2009.
 Australia began to lift rates in October last year, and is expected to announce another quarter-percentage point rise on Tuesday. Taiwan and South Korea could start to nudge up rates before the end of this quarter.
 By contrast, recovery in the United States and Europe is still tepid, meaning that no rate increases are expected until late this year.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on a Flurry of Hopeful Economic Reports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street rose on Monday as a flurry of reports bolstered hopes that the economy was recovering.
 The stronger reports on manufacturing activity and personal incomes helped shore up the market's mood after three losing weeks that left stocks with a loss for January. Investors were already becoming more optimistic in part because of news on Friday that, in the last three months of 2009, the economy grew at the fastest rate in six years.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 100 points, and other indexes logged similar gains. Energy stocks led the market higher after a strong earnings report from Exxon Mobil. 
 In economic news, manufacturing activity in the United States grew in January for a sixth consecutive month to the strongest level since August 2004, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The institute, a trade group, said factories increased production as customers replenished inventories.
 The manufacturing index jumped to 58.4 in January, from 54.9 in December. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a level of 55.5. Any reading above 50 signals growth.
 The Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0.2 percent in December, its third straight monthly gain. The government also said that personal income increased more than expected in December.
 ''The economy and the recovery seem to be on track. The G.D.P. number on Friday and the I.S.M. number today confirm that,'' said Kevin Shacknofsky, portfolio manager of the Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund in Purchase, N.Y.
 The government reported on Friday that the American economy grew at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the last three months of 2009, a pace far stronger than economists had forecast.
 The positive signals in the economic reports lent support to a market that fell sharply in late January, its worst monthly performance since the bear market early last year. The Dow Jones industrial average reached a 15-month high of 10,725.43 on Jan. 19; it is down 6.1 percent since then.
 At the close, the Dow was 118.20 points, or 1.17 percent, higher at 10,185.53. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.32 points, or 1.43 percent, to 1,089.19. The Nasdaq composite index increased 23.85 points, or 1.11 percent, to 2,171.20.
 Toyota announced on Monday that it had started sending a fix to dealers for recalled vehicles and that it would be available this week. 
 And Exxon Mobil, one of the world's largest publicly traded oil companies, said that its profit dropped 23 percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower oil prices and weaker demand for fuels in a slowing economy. Exxon reported net income of $6.05 billion, or $1.27 a share, in the past quarter. That compared with $7.82 billion, or $1.54 a share, a year ago.
 President Obamasent the Congress a $3.83 trillion budget on Monday that would add money to fight high unemployment and raise taxes on the wealthy. The nation's unemployment rate is 10 percent.
 The Federal Reserve said Monday that most banks were not erecting hurdles for people and businesses to get loans, a fresh sign that credit problems were easing.
 In a quarterly survey released Monday, the Federal Reserve found that ''commercial banks generally ceased tightening standards on many loan types'' at the end of 2009. Commercial real estate loans were the exception.
 Even though banks are not imposing restrictions on most loans, they are not ready to ease the tough loan standards put in place during the financial crisis. Banks ''have yet to unwind the considerable tightening that has occurred over the past two years,'' the Fed said.
 Meanwhile, demand for home mortgages and other consumer loans weakened, a sign that consumers were reluctant to make big purchases, given double-digit unemployment and the fragile economy.
 Consumers will help support economic growth, but they will not lead it by going on spending sprees. That is one reason the recovery this year is expected to be modest.
 Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was down 17/32, at 97 24/32, and the yield rose to 3.65 percent, from 3.58 percent late Friday.
 The dollar mostly fell against other major currencies, while gold prices rose.
 Crude oil rose $1.54, to $74.43 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction for three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Humana Posts a 44% Increase in Its Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky. 

 BODY:
The health insurer Humana posted a 44 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit on Monday as membership in its government-sponsored Medicare Advantage business offset a slumping commercial segment that was dragged down by the sluggish economy. 
 Humana also raised its 2010 earnings projection to $5.15 to $5.35 a share, up from a previous estimate of $5.05 to $5.25, but below the $5.40 expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
 Humana said it earned $250.7 million, or $1.48 a share, in the fourth quarter, up from $174.1 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 2 percent, to $7.63 billion from $7.49 billion, but missed Wall Street's forecast for $7.78 billion.
 Shares in Humana, which is based in Louisville, rose 9 cents, or 0.19 percent, to close at $48.71 on Monday.
 The company's government segment posted pretax income of $452.3 million in the fourth quarter compared with $267.3 million a year earlier. The increase was a result partly of lower claims expenses in its Medicare prescription drug plans and higher Medicare Advantage membership.
 Humana's commercial segment reported a wider fourth-quarter pretax loss, mainly because a larger percentage of premiums went to cover medical claims and other higher expenses.
 James E. Murray, Humana's chief operating officer, said during a conference call that the company was ''stepping back and reorganizing our commercial business.''
 ''We're identifying geographies and products that make the most sense for us in parts of the United States,'' he said, ''and that's how we're going to go to market going forward.''
 Humana's Medicare Advantage membership exceeded 1.5 million at year-end, up 5 percent from 2008. Medicare Advantage plans are government-sponsored, privately run programs for the elderly that offer comprehensive health coverage. Medicare Advantage premiums rose 12 percent, to $4.07 billion, in the fourth quarter.
 Medical membership in its commercial segment totaled just over 3.4 million as of Dec. 31, down 6 percent from the end of 2008. Humana attributed much of the decline to the recession and higher unemployment, which hurt its employer-sponsored health coverage plans.

HEADLINE: Williams College Will Bring Loans Back to Aid Packages

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Williams College, which two years ago replaced all loans in its student financial aid packages with direct scholarships that did not have to be repaid, is rescinding the policy amid the fallout of the economic downturn. 
 In a letter posted Sunday on the college's Web site, the interim president, Bill Wagner, said that as a result of a $500 million drop in Williams's endowment, ''it now seems prudent to reintroduce modest loans for some aided students, beginning with the class that enters in the fall of 2011.'' Current students will not be affected, nor will those entering this fall, Mr. Wagner wrote.
 Williams is one of several dozen colleges and universities, most of them private, that have removed loans from aid packages within the last three years in favor of scholarships. Such policies, similar to one announced by Princeton in the late 1990s, were a response to the steep loan debt accumulated by some students.
 Colleges often embarked on no-loan policies as a result of financial windfalls. Williams's endowment was still valued at a seemingly robust $1.4 billion last year. But in his letter, Mr. Wagner said, ''Williams is in a strong financial situation by virtually any comparison -- except with the Williams of three years ago.''
 Representatives for Amherst College, Davidson College and the University of North Carolina said Monday that they would continue to maintain no-loan policies similar to the one being rolled back by Williams. 
 Jess Lord, dean of admission at Haverford, another private college that does not require financial-aid students to take loans, said in an e-mail message, ''At present there are no plans to change'' that policy.
 But, noting that financial aid represented nearly 25 percent of the Haverford budget, Mr. Lord added, ''Financial aid policies are always discussed at Haverford -- and especially in times of budget stress like the past two years.''
 A Williams spokesman, Jim Kolesar, said the college expected to save about $2 million after the first four classes that are subject to the new policy have arrived on campus. And Mr. Wagner said Williams's most needy students ''will not be expected to borrow at all.''

HEADLINE: Sundance: Snow and Stars vs. Twitter and Google Alerts

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah 

 BODY:
An uncomfortable question surfaced at this year's Sundance Film Festival: In the digital age, is trekking to this mountain town each January becoming less necessary?
 Many fans and festival organizers, in particular Robert Redford, who founded the Sundance Institute in 1981, say no. Part of the enduring success of the event, which wrapped up its 11-day run on Sunday, involves the familial hub it provides for independent filmmakers and cinephiles -- a nuts-and-bolts industry convention disguised as a party.
 Even so, attendance has been falling since 2006, when about 53,000 people turned out. Last year the official count was 40,291. Festival organizers are still tabulating ticket reports for this year's installment but say numbers from the first week show a 1 percent uptick over last year. 
 Mr. Redford says a quieter festival is a blessing in disguise. ''The recession happened, and suddenly a lot of people around the edges -- ambush marketers and such -- didn't show, and that's fine with me,'' he said. ''This place was bursting at the seams. You couldn't get around anymore.''
 The recession has definitely taken a toll. But Mr. Redford and his team of programmers are battling other realities that could be affecting the festival's drawing power: the increasing availability of Sundance films on the Internet and on-demand cable services; a changing movie business; and competition from other festivals like South by Southwest in Texas.
 ''The spirit of Sundance is still there, but film festivals over all are becoming less crucial,'' said J. C. Spink, a partner at Benderspink, a Los Angeles management and production company. ''You can have a festival every night in your house online.''
 Mr. Spink used to make the pilgrimage to Park City every year. But he stayed home this time. ''You can now attend Sundance from afar,'' he said.
 Between Google alerts and Twitter, he can get immediate feedback on his iPhone about what films and performances are generating buzz. More films than ever are quietly traded on DVD in Los Angeles before or during the festival, or screened outright for distributors in Hollywood .
 Stars have long been part of Sundance's allure, but even some of the bold-face names who had films screening at this year's festival were absent. Natalie Portman starred in ''Hesher,'' which is also her producing debut, but introduced the film via video from New York, saying she couldn't break away from work. Ryan Gosling appeared to promote ''Blue Valentine,'' co-starring Michelle Williams. But his decision to interact with fans through the movie's Twitter account after he left might have created the bigger stir.
 More and more, Sundance is racing to leverage technology to make the films that screen here more available to fans. ''Opening new vistas'' is how Mr. Redford describes it, noting that he has always championed the broadest distribution possible of Sundance selections. In 1996 he helped created the Sundance Channel on cable, which has become so successful that it is now being introduced in other countries like France and South Korea.
 The question is whether the escalating availability of Sundance films in your living room, in some cases simultaneous with their premieres in Park City, will weaken the heart -- the festival -- of this enterprise, with its grants, working labs and dramaturge program. YouTube introduced its long-awaited movie rental option at this year's festival by offering five Sundance films as soon as they had their premieres.
 And for the first time, Sundance made movies available in about 40 million homes through cable and satellite on-demand services simultaneously with premieres. The program, Sundance Selects, includes ''Daddy Longlegs,'' a lighthearted drama about being torn between adulthood and childhood, and ''The Shock Doctrine,'' a documentary about the exploitation of moments of crisis in vulnerable countries by governments and big business.
 ''We now have opportunities to reach people in ways that we didn't have before, and I think we absolutely need to take advantage of them -- risk or not,'' Mr. Redford said. When it comes to new technology, he said his position was, ''How can you make a contribution and move it forward?''
 To make itself more relevant, Sundance is increasing efforts to get content to people who do not attend the festival, including introducing a new program called Sundance Film Festival USA, in which eight of the most high-profile movies from this year's line-up were screened in far-flung locations.
 ''Howl'' (about the early life of Allen Ginsberg), ''The Company Men'' (starring Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper) and ''The Runaways'' (starring Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett) were among the pictures that screened in places like Ann Arbor, Mich.; Nashville; and Brookline, Mass. And festival organizers made sure directors were on hand to participate in question-and-answer sessions afterward. 
 Still, Sundance seems aware of the need to protect its base. The selections for Sundance Film Festival USA and Sundance Selects might have been high-profile but were largely small films or films playing out of competition and were not among the winners of the festival's big prizes. The grand jury prize in the United States dramatic competition was given to ''Winter's Bone,'' about a girl in the Ozarks looking for her drug-dealing father, while ''Restrepo,'' about the fighting in Afghanistan, won the grand jury prize for an American documentary.
 Web downloads and video-on-demand services are great, but they will never replace the powerful experience of sitting in a darkened theater with a group of strangers and then chattering about what you've seen at the after-party, said Kevin Iwashina, a founder of Parlay Media, a film sales and production company.
 ''I think Sundance is smart to expand its footprint because it will help to increase the overall appetite for independent film,'' said Mr. Iwashina, who was shopping several movies at this year's festival, including ''Life 2.0,'' a documentary about the Second Life, a virtual online world. ''Attending the festival is a life experience, and there is no substitute.''

HEADLINE: In 2009, Exxon Grew as the Oil Industry Contracted

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
While much of the oil industry contracted last year, Exxon Mobil expanded its oil and gas operations in the United States and around the world.
 Exxon, the top Western oil company, took advantage of the weak climate to bolster its operations, buying smaller rivals and attractive assets as it sought to lay the foundation for growth once the economy rebounds. 
 In December, it announced the $31 billion purchase of XTO Energy, a leader in natural gas production in the United States. It gained a major foothold in Iraq, the holder of the third-biggest proven oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Iran. In Africa, it bid $4 billion for a major field off Ghana. It approved a multibillion-dollar project in Papua New Guinea to export gas to China and Japan. 
 The plan follows Exxon's longstanding strategy of investing during market declines. Because of its substantial cash reserves, the company spent a record $27.1 billion on its exploration and development programs last year, a 4 percent increase from 2008. 
 While most of its big rivals have been restructuring and cutting expenses, Exxon has repeatedly said that it would stick with plans to spend $25 billion to $30 billion a year over the next few years to develop new supplies.
 Still, like most major oil companies, Exxon was hurt by lower oil prices, and a drop in demand for oil and refined fuels as consumers cut spending and businesses shed jobs. 
 In the fourth quarter, Exxon Mobil's profit dropped 23 percent, to $6.05 billion, or $1.27 a share, compared with $7.82 billion, or $1.54 a share, in the period a year ago. 
 The earnings, however, beat analysts' expectations, helping drive up shares, which rose 2.72 percent on Monday, to $66.18.
 Revenue was up 6 percent, to $89.84 billion in the quarter.
 ''The industry trends in 2009 reflect a challenging environment over all,'' the company's vice president for investor relations, David Rosenthal, said during a conference call. ''Certainly a tough year. Tough for everyone. But we feel our competitive strengths have helped us a bit.''
 In 2008, Exxon became the world's most profitable corporation with earnings over $45 billion as oil averaged $100 a barrel. Last year, its profit dropped 57 percent, to $19.28 billion. The company was also displaced by PetroChina as the world's largest publicly traded company by market value, according to yearly rankings by PFC Energy, a consulting firm. 
 Oil prices, which collapsed when the financial crisis began, have since regained ground and settled above $74 a barrel on Monday in New York.
 Exxon's oil production averaged 2.39 million barrels a day in 2009, essentially flat from 2008 as lower output from mature fields was offset by increases from new projects in Qatar. Gas production grew 2 percent and averaged 9.3 billion cubic feet a day. 
 The plans to buy XTO, which are subject to approval, reflected Exxon's enthusiasm for unconventional gas resources, where reserves have swelled because of innovations in producing gas from a type of rock called shale. The estimated reserves in the United States are now expected to last more than 100 years at current consumption rates. 
 Exxon has been building a global portfolio of shale reserves in the United States, Germany, Hungary and Canada in recent years. It hopes that XTO's drilling expertise will help it expand its gas production rapidly.
 Exxon was also the first American company to gain access to Iraq's oil fields after winning the bidding for the West Qurna Phase 1 field with Royal Dutch Shell. The companies pledged to increase the field's output to 2.325 million barrels a day, up from 279,000 barrels a day. 
 Few countries offer oil companies as much potential growth as Iraq does. That explains why foreign companies, which initially complained about the Iraqi government's onerous terms, have all agreed to slash their profits in exchange for access to the country's reserves. 
 Exxon beat a group led by the Russian giant Lukoil that included ConocoPhillips, and another led by the China National Petroleum Corporation. It will receive $1.90 for each barrel of extra production from the field, less than half of the $4 a barrel that Exxon had originally bid. The field holds 8.7 billion barrels in proven oil reserves. 
 For most oil companies, the last year has been tough. On Friday, Chevron disappointed analysts with a forecast that its oil and gas production would grow just 1 percent this year, much less than expected. The lackluster forecast illustrates the difficulty some of the world's biggest oil companies are having as they try to expand output.
 Chevron's fourth-quarter profit dropped 37 percent, to $3.07 billion. 
 Separately, Shell said on Monday that it had signed an agreement with Cosan to form an ethanol joint venture in Brazil valued at $12 billion. 
 Both companies will contribute some of their existing Brazilian assets to the venture, and Shell would, in addition, contribute a $1.625 billion in cash over two years.
 Shell reports its earnings later this week.

HEADLINE: Lean Times For a Wilderness Race

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

DATELINE: WASILLA, Alaska 

 BODY:
Most days, a handful of devoted fans pay their respects in a tiny museum here dedicated to the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which has been run across Alaska's punishing wilderness for the last 37 years. And in March, spectators will come in droves to watch along the more than 1,000-mile course. 
 But the race may have less of a national audience this year. Its last remaining broadcast deal was not renewed, part of a $1 million decline in revenue as sponsors have also dropped out. 
 Accordingly, the prize purse shrank, and salaries and benefits for the race's employees were reduced, said Stan Hooley, the race's executive director. 
 ''This event, not unlike a lot of other sporting events -- and any other ventures, really -- isn't immune to what's happening with this country's economy,'' Hooley said. ''We've done our own little bit of financial suffering in the past few months.''
 Sponsorships and licensing fees for race video to broadcast and online outlets used to make up 35 percent of the race's income, Hooley said. Chevron and the outdoor gear retailer Cabela's did not renew their sponsorships for 2010, and others reduced their commitments. 
 Versus, which televised a series on the race the last four years, will not do so this year. Only local stations will cover the start, the finish and key points along the way.
 Cabela's cited the recession.
 ''It was purely an economic decision,'' said Joe Arterburn, a Cabela's spokesman. ''Unfortunately, the Iditarod was caught up in that.''
 Chevron would not discuss why it dropped its sponsorship, saying via e-mail: ''Chevron's community investments focus on funding programs that address three main areas: basic human needs, education and economic development. We are continually reviewing the programs we support to ensure they are aligned with that focus.''
 The event took a $485,000 blow last year when Cabela's reduced its commitment and the Discovery Channel declined to continue ''Iditarod: Toughest Race on Earth,'' a documentary series that ran in 2008.
 Elizabeth Hillman, a Discovery Channel spokeswoman, said that decision was aesthetic, not financial.
 ''The Iditarod is an amazing story of humans and animals, the good, the bad and the ugly,'' she said. ''But that didn't translate to the screen.'' 
 The only place to watch same-day coverage, Hooley said, will be Iditarod.com. But he played down the effect of reduced coverage. Hard-core race fans, he said, are better served by following up-to-the-minute action online rather than watching it on television shows broadcast weeks after the race. 
 Most of the race revenue, Hooley said, comes from the sale of Iditarod-branded gear and auction items, including a chance to ride with the current champion, Lance Mackey, for the first 11 miles. (The winning bid was $7,500.) About 65 percent of the operational budget of $3.7 million is raised this way, Hooley said, the bulk around race time.
 Iditarod staff members have taken pay cuts of at least 10 percent, but no one quit, Hooley said. Ten are full time and about 100 others, like veterinarians, race judges and trail sweepers, are contracted around the competition season.
 ''The Iditarod family are there for a lot of reasons, and money is only part of it,'' said Stuart Nelson Jr., the race's chief veterinarian for the last 15 years. 
 In addition to his race duties, Nelson is a year-round consultant to the Iditarod. He said his salary was reduced by 20 percent, to $17,500, this year. 
 ''Yeah, it's not fun getting less in return,'' he said. ''But it's just when it becomes part of your life, there are other reasons you do it.''
 With Iditarod.com as the sole viewing platform, competitors say a lack of exposure may have further consequences.
 ''It is sort of sad,'' said the Iditarod competitor Hugh Neff, adding that people will not get a chance to see ''what's going on in this part of the world.''
 More than two decades ago, Neff, then a college student in Illinois, was introduced to sled dog racing, or mushing, through television. He now raises more than 60 dogs at his Laughing Eyes Kennel.
 ''TV was my first inkling of what it was about,'' Neff said. ''Seeing the forbidden northern Arctic Alaska, the challenge of going 1,000 miles with just your best friends, your dogs.'' 
 But the shrinking purse -- under $600,000 this year, down from $925,000 in 2008 -- is potentially the most damaging consequence of the race's financial issues. Top-level contenders may spend up to $250,000 a year on breeding and training sled dogs for competition, Hooley said.
 ''The last thing that we ever want to do is reduce prize money because of the investment that it takes to prepare a race team on an individual basis,'' Hooley said. ''The less money that goes back into the mushing community for them to recoup their expenses, the more difficult it is for them.''
 The four-time champion Jeff King, who said he had won more than $1 million in about 30 years as a competitive musher, recently donated $50,000, as did the city of Nome. The Iditarod applied King's contribution to the prize coffer.
 ''I'm not a rich man by any means,'' King said. ''But I think I'm one of the few people in the history of the race who has made more than they have spent racing, and I'm willing to give it back.'' 
 King, who last won the race in 2006, is considered a serious contender.
 ''What a fairy tale that would be, to win it back,'' he said.
 King has made peace with the possibility that his rivals might go home with his money.
 ''I want them to continue to pay their bills,'' he said, ''so I can continue racing against them.''

HEADLINE: Saving Tiny Toads Without a Home

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
This is a story about a waterfall, the World Bank and 4,000 homeless toads. 
 Maybe the story will have a happy ending, and the bright-golden spray toads, each so small it could easily sit on a dime, will return to the African gorge where they once lived, in the spray of a waterfall on the Kihansi River in Tanzania.
 The river is dammed now, courtesy of the bank. The waterfall is 10 percent of what it was. And the toads are now extinct in the wild.
 But 4,000 of them live in the Bronx and Toledo, Ohio, where scientists at the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Toledo Zoo are keeping them alive in hopes, somehow, of returning them to the wild. This month, the Bronx Zoo will formally open a small exhibit displaying the toads in its Reptile House. 
 Meanwhile, though, the toads embody the larger conflicts between conservation and economic development and the complexity of trying to preserve and restore endangered species to the wild. Their story also raises questions about how much effort should go to save any one species.
 These issues are particularly pressing for frogs, toads and other amphibians, whose populations are plunging worldwide in the face of factors like habitat loss, climate change and disease. Jennifer B. Pramuk, the curator of herpetology at the Bronx Zoo. said at least 120 species vanished in recent years.
 ''It's probably much higher than that,'' said Dr. Pramuk, a leader in the toad effort. ''There are areas of South America where all the amphibious fauna are wiped out.''
 The spray toads, Nectophrynoides asperginis, were unknown to science until 1998, when they were found living on less than five acres, perhaps the smallest known range of any vertebrate. They are unusual in that they do not lay eggs. The baby toads emerge fully formed, each one small enough to fit on the head of a pin. 
 When the toads were first described, as many as 20,000 lived in the misty waterfall tract on the Kihansi, climbing mossy plants and feeding on small insects. But the government of Tanzania, with a loan from the World Bank, was already planning a dam upstream. 
 When the dam opened in 2000, the flow of water to the dam fell by 90 percent, and mist-dependent native plants gave way to invasive species. Within months, the toad population plummeted. When the survivors contracted a fungal disease called chytrid, the toad population fell again. 
 The species was in imminent danger of disappearing. So the conservation society responded by sending in Jason Serle, a wild-animal keeper at the time, and Tim Davenport, a field programs director in Tanzania. Along with Tanzanian scientists and conservation officials, they spent a day at the gorge, collecting 499 toads and putting them in plastic bags with damp moss. The bags were placed into coolers for the flight back to the Bronx. 
 ''It was get on the plane, collect them, get back,'' said Jim Breheny, the director of the Bronx Zoo.
 The problem then was how to keep them alive. The Bronx Zoo sent toads to five other zoos in the United States, but only one of them, the Toledo Zoo, managed to keep them alive, as did the Bronx Zoo. 
 ''No one had kept anything in that genus in captivity,'' Dr. Pramuk said. ''It was very difficult for us to figure out what they needed.'' 
 The crucial factors, not surprisingly, turned out to be water, light and food -- very carefully prepared water, light and food. 
 Jason Wagner, a life-support specialist at the Bronx Zoo, assembled a system of tanks, pipes, filters, aerating vats and other equipment in the warm damp behind the scenes in the reptile house. The system produces 1,500 gallons a day of pure mist to be sprayed into the toad tanks. The system is necessary because the treatments that help make city water safe for people would be lethal for the toads. 
 Halogen bulbs provided the best light; the Toledo Zoo figured that out. And Alyssa Borek, a zookeeper in the Bronx, produced a safe food supply by breeding tiny bugs like fruit flies, wood lice and weevils in plastic shoeboxes and other containers filled with cocoa matting, beans and alder leaves that she gathers on the zoo grounds. 
 Ms. Borek raises the insects for several generations to make sure they are disease-free before she feeds them to the toads, who, except for the 60 or so on exhibit, live in 26 aquarium tanks in two clean rooms at the zoo. Even so, she said, an outbreak of chytrid in one of her tanks killed half of that population within days. The rest died in less than a week, she said, ''even with aggressive treatment by our veterinary staff.'' She still does not know how the disease erupted. 
 Ms. Borek also called in zoo vets to perform a ''C-section'' when a pregnant toad died. The babies, delivered from their dead mother's eggs, were born as tadpoles. Ms. Borek kept them in petri dishes, but after a few weeks they too had died. 
 The overall effort, however, was a success. By trial and error, the zoos kept the spray toads alive. 
 Ms. Borek learned so much that she wrote a husbandry guide for the species; Dr. Pramuk said it would be useful for anyone raising frogs or toads. In fact, working with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the Bronx and Toledo Zoos will offer their third course on toad husbandry at the Toledo Zoo in April. 
 As the effort of raising the toads in the zoos progressed, their numbers in Tanzania declined until last November, when the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which maintains listings of endangered species worldwide, declared the toad extinct in the wild.
 That finding presented the next hurdle: reintroducing the toads to the wild. 
 There is ''at least the potential for a viable restoration program,'' Mr. Breheny, the Bronx Zoo director, said, but a lot depends on conditions and the operation of the dam. The World Bank has established an artificial mist system there, and workers have dug out invasive plants, but it is unknown whether these efforts will be enough.
 The scientists said they did not blame the dam-builders for all this trouble. ''Tanzania is a real poor country and they needed a source of electricity,'' Dr. Pramuk said. ''When people weighed their options, it was for them an easy decision.''
 Nonetheless, Dr. Pramuk is not troubled by the money spent to preserve the toad -- ''I'm guessing it's in the millions,'' she said. 
 ''Either you lose the species or you do something about it,'' she said. 
 Dr. Pramuk said efforts to breed other amphibians in captivity and reintroduce them had met with some success, with 13 of 21 species reintroduced into the wild breeding for multiple generations. Of the rest, five showed some breeding, and three have at least survived after being released.
 So the rescue work proceeds. The toads destined for Tanzania must be screened, to make sure they will not bring alien pathogens with them. Meanwhile, scientists at the zoos and the University of Dar es Salaam are developing ways to keep the reintroduced toads in pens in the gorge to track their mortality and monitor their reaction to their new environment.
 Dr. Pramuk said researchers would gather in Tanzania later this month to develop guidelines for this work with colleagues at the University of Dar es Salaam and the Sokoine University of Agriculture. And Mr. Breheny said that if all went well, the conservation society would begin returning the spray toads to their Tanzanian home this year.
 The society will use knowledge gained in the process in efforts to sustain threatened amphibians elsewhere. ''Amphibians tend to be small, they produce a lot of offspring and generally have a short generation time,'' Mr. Breheny said. ''We can raise them in small spaces and get numbers up and consider restoration if the environment is safe for them.''
 But they do not want to move too fast. ''We don't want to lose it on the last leg of the journey,'' he said.
 Mr. Breheny conceded that given the small number of spray toads, their minuscule range and their extreme vulnerability to environmental disturbance, it was possible that the researchers might one day have to conclude that returning them to the wild was impossible. Then they would have to evaluate the merits of continuing to keep them alive at all.
 ''We have talked about it,'' he said. ''What would be the point of maintaining these toads if there was no hope of restoring them to the wild? We don't know if you would maintain them in that situation. But right now. ...''

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Shows Signs of Strengthening

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Manufacturing in the United States expanded at the fastest rate in five years in January, renewing hope that rising activity at the nation's factories may help lead the economy out of its downturn.
 New orders increased, employment picked up and production gained strength last month, according to the Institute for Supply Management's monthly barometer. Nearly every corner of the sector, from textile mills to plastics factories, reported growth.
 ''If you look at the last two recessions, we didn't hit this kind of pace of manufacturing growth until two to three years into the recovery,'' said John Ryding, chief economist for RDQ Economics. ''Manufacturing is rebounding more sharply even after going through a much deeper recession.'' 
 The manufacturing barometer reached 58.4 in January, up from 54.9 in December and above analyst's forecasts of 55.5 (a reading above 50 signals expansion). Employment reached its highest level since 2006.
 A critical reason for the growth in manufacturing is that many factories are letting their stockpiles shrink at a slower rate than they had previously. In addition, exports are rising , and domestic demand is improving in part because of government stimulus efforts.
 As economists sketch the outlook for a recovery, manufacturing is considered one of the few sectors that may have enough momentum to drive growth. The economy grew at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, and this year, economists expect manufacturing to outpace the overall growth rate.
 The bright outlook for manufacturing contrasts starkly with the forecast for an area like consumer spending, a historical hotbed of economic activity. A separate report on Monday underscored the mediocre outlook for spending prospects: high unemployment has kept wages low in the United States, and Americans appear to be saving more in light of depleted retirement accounts and tight credit.
 The government has pumped billions into the economy as it tries to lure Americans back to the cash register. In December, however, those efforts showed only modest results, with spending up 0.2 percent and income up 0.4 percent, according to the Commerce Department.
 ''It's not booming growth, but it is growth,'' said Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase. ''We're not seeing really strong labor income growth yet, and that's the biggest restraint on consumers.''
 On Friday, the government will offer its latest snapshot of unemployment, and the jobless rate is expected to remain at 10 percent.
 Americans' views on spending appear to be fundamentally shifting. After decades of carefree spending facilitated by the easy availability of credit, consumers are saving more. The saving rate -- the proportion of income remaining after expenses and taxes -- reached 4.8 percent in December, and economists expect it to continue to rise. 
 A gauge of inflation in the report showed a 1.5 percent growth in prices compared with 2008. Despite the increase, economists say they believe inflation is not an immediate threat because of the large amount of unused capacity in the economy and high unemployment.
 A third report on Monday showed that construction spending fell more than expected in December, dragged down by a troubled commercial real estate market. Spending fell 1.2 percent, to an annual rate of $902.6 billion -- the fifth decrease in six months. Analysts had expected a 0.5 percent drop.
 Construction of single-family homes appears to be slowing, increasing 0.6 percent in December, the smallest gain in seven months. Construction of public buildings was also weak, falling for a fifth consecutive month. 
 Construction spending has suffered in the face of falling rents, higher vacancies and the travails of financiers who bet huge amounts on large complexes, like Stuyvesant Town in New York City. Construction spending fell 12.4 percent last year, compared with 2008.

HEADLINE: Most Countries Submit Emission Reduction Targets by Deadline

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The climate change accord reached at Copenhagen in December passed its first test on Monday after countries responsible for the bulk of climate-altering pollution formally submitted their emission reduction plans, meeting the agreement's Jan. 31 deadline.
 Most major nations -- including the United States, the 27 nations of the European Union, China, India, Japan and Brazil -- restated earlier pledges to curb emissions by 2020, some by promising absolute cuts, others by reducing the rate of increase from a business-as-usual curve. 
 In all, 55 developed and developing countries submitted emission reduction plans to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body overseeing global negotiations. Two major nations -- Mexico and Russia -- had not submitted plans as of Monday evening. 
 United Nations officials said that the countries that have already filed plans account for 78 percent of greenhouse gas emissions globally.
 The so-called Copenhagen Accord was pasted together in the final hours of the United Nations-sponsored climate summit meeting that ended Dec. 19. The skeletal agreement was not formally adopted by the conference, is not binding on the parties and sets no deadline for reaching a formal international climate change treaty.
 Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations' climate change office, said that the submissions showed that the commitment to confront climate change on the part of the world's nations was ''beyond doubt,'' but he urged countries to do more. 
 ''Greater ambition is required to meet the scale of the challenge,'' he said.
 Analysts said that even if all nations met their promises, the world would still be on a path to exceed the Copenhagen agreement's central goal of limiting global warming to less than 3.6 degrees above the pre-industrial era.
 ''The pledges put on the table to date do not put us on track to meet that goal and will make it very difficult for us politically and technically beyond 2020 to meet that target,'' said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
 Other aspects of the accord remain unresolved, including the question of financial aid for developing nations to adapt to climate changes and develop sustainable growth plans. The wealthy nations pledged nearly $30 billion in short-term support, but there is no mechanism in place to collect or distribute the money. Longer-term aid pledges remain just a concept.
 Nonetheless, it was the first time that major developing nations, whose emissions are growing more quickly than the rest of the world's, put on paper their plans for slowing production of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to a warming planet.
 China said it would reduce its carbon intensity -- the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic activity -- by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels.
 India said its carbon intensity would fall by 20 to 25 percent over the same period.
 South Korea set an intensity target of 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. 
 Raekwon Chung, the South Korean ambassador for climate change, said that his nation's target was set into law in December and that the government was preparing plans to carry it out. 
 He said South Korea planned to invest 2 percent of its gross domestic product, about $86 billion a year, in green growth programs, including low-carbon energy production, new transportation systems and higher-efficiency building codes.
 The major industrialized powers also repeated earlier pledges. The European Union said its 27 members would cut emissions by 20 to 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020. Japan's target is 25 percent over the same period.
 The United States, in a submission last Thursday, repeated President Obama's promise to cut emissions ''in the range of'' 17 percent by 2020 compared with 2005 levels -- but only if Congress enacts legislation that meets that goal, a far-from-certain prospect.
 Jennifer Morgan, director of the World Resources Institute's climate and energy program, urged Congress to act quickly on climate change legislation, or risk seeing the United States fall further behind in the competition to develop new low-carbon sources of energy.
 ''The pledges made by countries like Japan, China, Europe and India show a commitment to collective, transparent action on a scale never seen before,'' she said in a statement. ''The United States should have no doubt that these countries plan to build their economies with clean energy.''

Well
 From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, nytimes.com/well.
 In the mid-1980s, a Newsweek article declared that a single, college-educated 40-year-old woman was more likely to die in a terrorist attack than walk down the aisle. The claim convinced generations of women that if they weren't married by 40, it probably wouldn't happen. 
 The debate was recently revived when a study from the Pew Research Center reported that high earning, college-educated women have a dwindling pool of likeminded marriage partners. Now, a briefing paper from the Council on Contemporary Families is trying to set the record straight about marriage, education and women. For college-educated women who hope to marry someday, the news is good.
 In the paper, the economists Betsey Stevenson and Adam Isen of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania analyze marriage data from the Census and the 2008 American Community Survey. They note that women with a college degree have historically been the ''least likely'' group of women to marry but that those numbers have been changing with each passing decade.
 In 1950, 90 percent of white female high school graduates had married by 40; fewer than 75 percent of college-educated white women had done so. By 1980, college-educated women began marrying at higher rates and closing the gap. 
 Since then, marriage rates have fallen for all women, but now the chance of marriage by 40 is about the same with or without a college degree. 
 In 2008, 86 percent of 40-year-old white female college graduates were married, almost the same as those with only a high school degree.
 Consults
 Dr. Neena S. Abraham answered reader questions about ulcers, at nytimes.com/consults.
 If your physician has suggested you take aspirin to reduce your risk of heart disease, it is important to remember that even small doses of daily aspirin -- including baby aspirin, at a dose of 81 milligrams daily -- can increase your risk of ulcers and bleeding. 
 All Nsaids, including over-the-counter aspirin, have the potential to damage the tissue of the gastrointestinal tract. Damage can occur anywhere, from mouth to anus. 
 Over-the-counter doses of aspirin, or buffered or enteric coated aspirin preparations, do not eliminate the risk of developing an Nsaid-related ulcer. Your risk for bleeding is still twofold to fourfold greater than if you weren't taking the aspirin product. This risk increases in magnitude as the dose of the aspirin increases. Some studies have suggested that one-third of aspirin-induced ulcers are related to over-the-counter aspirin use. The excess ulcer bleeding risk associated with aspirin use is estimated at 5 extra cases per 1,000 patients per year. 
 It is important, however, to remember that your risk of aspirin-induced ulcer will further increase if you are over 60, have a history of ulcers or are taking aspirin with other drugs like ibuprofen, naproxen, warfarin or steroids.
 Aspirin is not a nutritional supplement -- it is a medication with real risks and side effects, so it should not be taken without explicit cardiovascular risk assessment by your doctor.

HEADLINE: Fire Dept., Facing Cuts, Starts Deciding What to Close

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
New York City's plans to close as many as 20 fire companies will require the Fire Department to undertake its most radical reorganization since the financial crisis of the 1970s, according to senior department officials.
 As a result, the department is analyzing statistics, block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood, to determine how it can most safely take engines and ladder trucks out of service.
 ''If we have to close 20 companies, which is a 6 percent reduction in the number of companies we have, it is going to tax us,'' said Salvatore J. Cassano, the newly appointed commissioner of the Fire Department of New York. ''It is certainly the most challenging thing we have faced in decades.'' 
 For now, the plan to eliminate 20 companies -- either the engines that pump water to fires or the ladders that ferry rescuers into buildings -- is among an assortment of savings included in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed budget. The final cuts will result from negotiations with the City Council, whose leaders have traditionally moved to restore neighborhood firefighting resources but are unsure they can do so this year. 
 The reality, however, that the Fire Department will have to shrink -- it is apt to lose more than 500 of the 8,500 rank-and-file firefighters on the force, through attrition, if 20 companies are closed -- comes at a time of both considerable triumph and challenge for the department. Fire deaths in the city last year were a record low. And response times, according to department data, were impressive.
 Yet union leaders are likely to seize on any fatal fire -- like the one that killed five people in Brooklyn on Saturday -- as a warning that company closings could lead to more catastrophic results.
 Still, the department has been expected to play an even greater role in the work it has taken on over the past 15 years, serving as emergency medical responders to tens of thousands of calls for help every year.
 Glenn P. Corbett, an associate professor of fire science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, served on a mayoral commission in 2003, when six companies were closed.
 ''That was a bitter debate, and that pales in comparison to this,'' Mr. Corbett said. ''Staffing issues arise, and training issues. There is a domino effect; there are implications all the way up and down the line.''
 Mr. Cassano is huddling with his staff chiefs to make choices based on several crucial points of data, including: the streets and neighborhoods where fires strike most; how long it takes rigs to respond to emergencies; and the proximity of fire companies to the people and places they must protect, including schools, housing complexes, hospitals and high-rise offices.
 Mr. Cassano, 64, who has held every rank in the department over 40 years, said any large-scale reconfiguring of his department would have implications for firefighters and residents.
 Response times could creep up. A smaller number of firefighters might leave those remaining more physically taxed. Wear and tear on the department's trucks and equipment could prove damaging, he said.
 The Fire Department is far different from the one Mr. Cassano joined in 1969. The 26,666 structural fires last year represented roughly half the number reported in 1970. Fewer New Yorkers died in fires -- 73 -- last year than in any year since the city began keeping count in 1915. And response times, according to the department's spokesman, were the fastest on record -- 4 minutes 2 seconds on average.
 But there are other demands. The department's personnel performed 209,563 medical runs last year. And its overall number of runs, counting car accidents and building alarms, totaled nearly 475,000 -- well more than double the total from four decades ago.
 Mr. Cassano said he was mapping out his options for which companies to close in the least harmful ways, how to reorganize large parts of his mechanized force and why.
 His chessboard, so to speak, has 198 engines and 143 ladders, most of them sharing firehouses throughout the five boroughs.
 Officials are taking a war-games approach. They are using computer modeling to gauge the effects of taking certain companies out of service, ranking fires by numbers of alarms and which trucks arrive when, and taking into account population maps and shifts in city business hubs.
 It is possible that the fiscal straits faced by both the city and the state will make any late-game saving of fire companies less likely. Mr. Bloomberg is planning not only to close companies but also to cut the number of firefighters on some 60 engines across the city.
 Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, said, ''It could get worse, depending on what the state does.''
 City budget officials have what they call an Albany contingency plan, which would take place if state lawmakers accept the governor's proposal to cut $1.3 billion in aid to the city. The mayor's contingency plan calls for laying off 1,050 firefighters instead of losing the positions by attrition, and the plan would force the closing of 42 fire companies.
 No final decisions have been made on the budgets or, Mr. Cassano said, on which fire companies to close. There is a whole new year of data to analyze.
 Whatever answers come, and whichever way the budget battle goes, Mr. Cassano will have delicate issues to manage with the work force. Union leaders fought the cuts in 2003, and they are already gearing up for a fight this time.
 Al Hagan, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, said in an interview on Friday that it was ''morally wrong to cut fire companies,'' and he planned to tell lawmakers that. The city's fire companies, he said, are ''like a fabric,'' interrelated, and ''to eliminate any stitch or any thread in the fabric diminishes the strength of the whole.''
 Ms. Quinn said it was too early in the budget process to say if the cuts would be restored and that the impact of the state budget was unknown. She said the company closings, if enacted, would have the most ''jarring impact on the department in its history.''
 And she said, ''That is a part of history none of us want to say we helped create.''

HEADLINE: Meetings Industry In Midst of a Makeover

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BACK in the boom years, I used to attend many of the major travel industry trade shows, which were always held in places with monstrous convention centers like Las Vegas, New Orleans and Orlando, Fla. 
 And the parties they threw at night! I remember one where a big travel company rented Sea World for a lavish reception for hundreds of people, with Champagne, ice sculptures and a special performance by whales leaping into the air. When I remarked to one of the trainers that the whales all had unworldly, gleaming white smiles, she confided that a marine dental veterinarian came in to bleach the creatures' teeth. 
 But much of the fun -- along with a significant amount of business travel spending on events -- ended in the fall of 2008. The weak economy was a big factor. But so was the public outrage after lawmakers in Washington disclosed that the insurance giant the American International Group had held a lavish retreat at a California resort just a week after the government had extended an $85 billion loan to the company. 
 Companies were already cutting back on travel spending at the time. But the A.I.G. Effect, as it is still widely known in the meetings and conventions business, was deep and abiding.
 In the 2007, the meetings industry represented about 44 percent of the roughly $200 billion in business travel spending, according to the U.S. Travel Association. But the meetings business is now in a deep slump. In the first half of 2009, domestic hotels lost $1 billion in revenue from canceled meetings alone, the travel trade group said. For the first 11 months of 2009, convention attendance in Las Vegas was off 25 percent from the same period in 2008, the convention bureau there said.
 Now, as business travel slowly comes back, the meetings part of it is struggling to regain its footing. In the process, it is being redefined. One, events are being planned with a far greater emphasis on cost control. And two, at least for some events, companies are increasingly relying on sophisticated technology to eliminate physical events and instead hold virtual meetings that do not require travel.
 ''We try to help companies understand that they have to be more strategic about their travel and meetings spending, and that there has to be a lot more transparency on that spending communicated to senior executives,'' said Kevin Iwamoto, the vice president for enterprise strategy at StarCite, a company that provides technology for overall management of corporate meetings and events.
 Mr. Iwamoto said the number of meetings planned this year was actually on the rise, though sails had been trimmed. StarCite and some competitors offer technology that allows companies to pull together the complicated logistical and financial arrangements involved in organizing a convention, he said. Companies can negotiate prices in the traditional big convention and meetings cities where hotels and convention centers are eager to replace lost business. And they can weigh the integration of videoconferencing into the meetings process, he said.
 Meanwhile, he said, StarCite's technology enabled cities that were formerly overlooked by many meetings organizers to compete more aggressively for business, offering lower hotel and convention space rates so planners could decide to ''avoid or downsize certain venues, the types of hotels being used and other traditional costs.'' He added: ''There is much more flexibility in venues. It's more of a buyer's market.''
 Some companies are eliminating physical meetings entirely. In 2005, Steve Strickland, a longtime producer of corporate events, said he got an estimate for a big meeting that was 20 percent higher than the previous year's, at a time when companies were already complaining about the soaring cost of events.
 ''I threw it down,'' he said, ''and said, 'This is it.' We didn't know then what would happen to the economy in 2008, but I could see where this was going. So I said, what I really need is a virtual convention center.'' He founded a company called Expos2 that now does 100 to 150 trade shows and other events, all online. He said he figured that Expos2 along with several competitors could easily grab 10 to 20 percent of the existing meetings business. 
 His company will do about 1,000 virtual events this year, he said. ''We're digitalizing the expo event,'' he added. 
 The Web site, Expos2.com, opens with a physical layout of a convention center, with links to programs and exhibits. Navigation is as simple as those virtual home tours that real estate sellers use to display a house. Lectures and presentations are live and interactive, but can also be archived. Costs to mount or attend an exhibition are a fraction of a physical event.
 Ah, but what about those after-hours parties? ''I actually had someone say to me, 'If you keep all those sales people from going to conventions in Las Vegas, how are they going to go to strip clubs?' '' he said. ''I simply didn't have an answer for that.''

HEADLINE: Another Delay in Signing of Contract for Railyards Complex

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The developer selected to build a $15 billion residential and commercial complex over the railyards on the Far West Side of Manhattan has once again delayed signing a formal contract for the project and making a down payment. The developer, the Related Companies, also lost its partner, Goldman Sachs, which unexpectedly pulled out of the project last week. 
 Nevertheless, Related has told the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the 26-acre railyards, that it is confident that it will complete the contract by the end of March and put a $21.7 million payment into escrow. If it does, Related would also be required to post an additional $21.7 million over the following 12 months.
 The project has been hobbled by the recession and the lack of financing for real estate projects. But Jay Cross, who oversees the project for Related, says it appears that New York's commercial and residential markets are stabilizing, which bodes well for the project. ''We remain optimistic,'' Mr. Cross said Monday. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. It had a one-third stake in the partnership, and still owns 5 percent of Related itself.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made the railyards, which sit between 10th and 12th Avenues, from 30th to 33rd Streets, a signature project of his administration on almost the first day he took office in 2002. The city rezoned the Far West Side, a neighborhood of warehouses, factories, parking lots and tenements, during the real estate boom in 2005.
 Three years later, the authority and the city struck a deal to sell the development rights over the railyards to Related for $1 billion, money needed for new trains, track repairs and the expansion of the transit system.
 Although the Bloomberg administration is rapidly building an extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to 34th Street and 10th Avenue, progress at the railyards has been slow.
 Related got its first extension a year ago. The two sides have been negotiating the details of a contract ever since. The is both complicated and expensive, requiring the developer to build a platform over the railyards, at a cost of well over $1 billion.
 The New York Observer reported the latest delay last week. Critics have said Related has moved slowly in order to delay making a down payment, while retaining development rights during the recession. But the proposed contract would not allow it to delay forever. Under certain conditions, it must start construction or risk losing its down payment and development rights.

HEADLINE: Moving the 9/11 Trial Out of New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''U.S. Drops Plan for a 9/11 Trial in New York City'' (front page, Jan. 30):
 While the decision to move the trial of the 9/11 plotters from New York to an as yet undisclosed place is welcome, one must still ask: How could such an absurd decision have been made in the first place?
 Why the Obama administration disregarded the economic damage that would be inflicted upon a city already reeling from the current financial meltdown is beyond belief -- particularly a city still coping with residual psychic wounds resulting from the attacks of that fateful day. 
 Yes, the administration has reversed a poor decision, but, incredibly, as of only a few days ago the plan was still ''a go.'' One hopes that this is a sign that President Obama is beginning to listen to people with some common sense instead of only his inner circle.
 Steven Morris East Hampton, N.Y., Jan. 30, 2010
 To the Editor: 
 This is a case of Nimby gone amok. It's O.K. to have civilian trials, but not here. Real estate brokers are worried about the negative effect on the market value of apartments; community leaders are worried about shutting down Chinatown and the financial district. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who can always be counted on for a mercantile perspective, does an about-face. 
 The bottom line is that the terrorism trials in New York City would have affected the bottom line. Can New Yorkers think of nothing else? 
 Alexander Goldstein Brooklyn, Jan. 30, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''It Happened in Our Backyard'' (editorial, Jan. 31):
 Regardless of whether one believes that the Khalid Shaikh Mohammed terrorism trial should be held in New York City or elsewhere, the basic premise is solid: this trial must be conducted publicly and in a democratic, civilian court. To follow former President George W. Bush's plan for military tribunals would be an insult to our foundational democratic beliefs, and a statement of distrust in our country's ability to function as a democracy. 
 Given that, the costs and resources must certainly be shared by all, through federal government coverage for security and costs. The 9/11 attacks were against the United States, not individual targets; we must respond as a united country in conducting these trials.
 Aaron Taylor Houston, Jan. 31, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In response to your editorial, our civilian judiciary has a long history of moving high-profile trials away from crime sites -- usually because of defendant motions to avoid prejudice. Certainly, holding an open civilian trial at one of the alternative secured sites within the Southern District would undermine neither the quality of justice nor the political statement. 
 My objection to the downtown location focused not on the money but on the unconscionable, unprecedented, multiyear disruption to lives and businesses and vital services. Clearly, the federal government overlooked the facts that the only neighborhood playground sits right around the corner, and that people who have been through so much since 9/11 live right across the street from the courthouse. 
 A nation that genuinely extols humanitarian values would not so totally upset the lives of children or anyone for the sake of even the most important of political statements when the statement could effectively be delivered from elsewhere.
 Alan J. Gerson New York, Jan. 31, 2010
 The writer is a former New York City Council member representing Lower Manhattan.
 To the Editor: 
 Holed up in his hideaway, Osama bin Laden must be congratulating himself upon hearing the news that now, more than eight years after 9/11, Americans are still so terrified of his power that they are afraid to try Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described 9/11 mastermind, at the scene of his crime in New York City. 
 Opponents of a trial venue in New York are successfully demonstrating that fear and minor commercial disruption are sufficient reasons to derail the democratic process and in so doing confirm to the world that our repeated representations of freedom and liberty are unconvincing rhetoric. 
 Comfortably assured that at every opportunity spineless demagogues will spread fear and doubt, Osama bin Laden can sleep comfortably with confidence that he need do little more to terrorize America.
 Arthur L. Yeager Edison, N.J., Jan. 31, 2010
 To the Editor: 
 Re ''Another Inconvenient Truth,'' by Gail Collins (column, Jan. 30):
 Ms. Collins calls those opposed to holding terrorism trials in Lower Manhattan selfish. Recently, Lower Manhattan residents packed Community Board 1 meetings pleading that the trials be held elsewhere. They were worried, even terrified. Many still have health problems and post-traumatic stress syndrome from the destruction of the World Trade Center. Some lost friends, family, homes and businesses because of 9/11.
 If the trials were going to last a few weeks or even a few months, I think that these residents would have put up with them, but they were told that the trials would probably go on for years. 
 Most of the people who spoke at the community board meetings favored civilian trials in a federal court -- not military trials -- but the prospect of not having free access to their homes, of snipers on the rooftops, of having to send their children to school past a security cordon and other ''inconveniences'' was too much for them to accept. 
 It would be incorrect to dismiss these fears as selfish.

HEADLINE: In Proposal, Obama Takes the Long View

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Donald G. McNeil Jr. and Kenneth Chang contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama declared in presenting his new 10-year budget proposal on Monday that ''our fiscal situation remains unacceptable,'' but he insisted that the country pursue his ambitious domestic agenda despite facing swollen budget deficits for the foreseeable future. 
 ''Just as it would be a terrible mistake to borrow against our children's future to pay our way today, it would be equally wrong to neglect their future by failing to invest in areas that will determine our economic success in this new century,'' Mr. Obama said at the White House. 
 The budget projects that the deficit will peak at nearly $1.6 trillion in the current fiscal year, a post-World War II record, and then decline but remain at economically troublesome levels over the remainder of the decade. In the coming fiscal year 2011, which begins in October, the projected shortfall would be under $1.3 trillion.
 Over 10 years, according to the administration, the budget would save an estimated $1.2 trillion, mainly by ending the Bush tax cuts for the richest Americans and freezing some domestic spending for three years. But that total is roughly one-fifth of the size of the debt that will pile up from now to 2020, the budget shows. 
 In the short run, some relatively minor domestic programs as well as big-ticket military equipment would be cut or eliminated, while education and civilian research would get big increases. Wealthy Americans, big banks and oil and gas companies would pay more in taxes, but the middle class and small businesses would get additional tax cuts worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
 Republican leaders in Congress, in a flurry of news releases, dismissed the Obama budget with the identical phrase: ''more of the same.''
 ''More spending, more taxes and more debt,'' added Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader.
 But Mr. Obama, in the budget message accompanying the fiscal volumes, said most of the debt owes to the spending and tax cuts of the past decade when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress. He took credit for having made ''hard choices and painful trade-offs not seen in Washington for many years.''
 Mr. Obama's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, said the president would keep his campaign promise to cut the deficit he inherited in half by the end of his term. By the administration's calculation, the deficit for fiscal year 2013 will be equal to just over 4 percent of the gross domestic product. When Mr. Obama took office, the projected $1.3 trillion deficit was equivalent to more than 9 percent of the gross domestic product.
 Even so, the president's budget shows that by the end of the decade, annual deficits will begin moving up inexorably, reflecting the fast-rising costs of health and retirement programs for an aging baby-boom population.
 Economists generally say annual deficits should not consistently exceed 3 percent. While Mr. Obama's budget would get no closer than 3.6 percent in any of the next 10 years, he proposes to reach the lower level by 2015 with the help of a yet-to-be-named bipartisan commission -- an uncertain prospect at best given the intensity of Republicans' opposition to his agenda.
 The House and Senate Republican leaders have signaled strongly that they will not cooperate. Even Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, who unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to create a bipartisan debt-reduction commission by law, declined in an interview on Monday to say he would serve on a presidential commission if asked. 
 ''I would have to see how it's structured and whether I thought it was real and viable or just political cover'' for the Democrats in an election year, Mr. Gregg said.
 All budgets are at bottom statements of a president's or a party's priorities, and in his latest document Mr. Obama made plain that he is standing by his, undaunted by either the legislative setbacks of the past year or the sluggish economic recovery.
 His $3.8 trillion budget for fiscal year 2011 incorporates his signature proposals to overhaul the health care system and energy policies, though they are languishing in Congress. Education, civilian research, food and drug safety and biomedical research would all get more money. For NASA, Mr. Obama proposed to cancel plans to return to the moon but sought $18 billion in spending for new technologies that could take humans farther into space. 
 The budget request for the Department of Health and Human Services was $81.3 billion, up from $79.6 billion a year ago. The National Institutes of Health's budget request rose by $1 billion, to $32 billion, more than was requested last year.
 Few reductions he called for would be easy or politically painless. Dozens of the 120 programs Mr. Obama has proposed to cut or kill are retreads because Congress rejected or ignored them last year. Mr. Obama said it was ''just common sense,'' for example, to kill a program to restore lands at abandoned mines that already have been cleaned up. But Western senators of both parties blocked that idea in 2009.
 Mr. Obama does not make the really hard choices about entitlement programs -- Medicare and Medicaid, especially -- and about taxes that most budget analysts say are essential to cut annual deficits and to begin paying down an accumulated debt. 
 The nation's publicly held debt, much of it owed to China and other foreign creditors, by 2020 would equal 77 percent of the gross domestic product, the highest level since 1950. Then the postwar debt was on its way down; now it is on its way up to unsustainable heights.
 While the president has proposed to save hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare as part of his health care overhaul, he would expand Medicaid, which covers low-income people and many nursing home residents. Both government health programs are exempt from the three-year domestic spending freeze that Mr. Obama proposed, as is spending for national security and veterans programs.
 Many budget analysts say that the president's campaign promise against raising taxes on any Americans making less than $250,000 also is a big hurdle to significant deficit reduction. But administration officials dismiss the criticism, saying that Republicans would not support such tax increases anyway.
 Mr. Obama, though, will direct the proposed bipartisan commission to consider changes to both taxes and entitlement benefits. His budget director, Mr. Orszag, declined at a press briefing to rule out tax increases for the middle class as part of a commission's charge. ''Let's let it do its work,'' he said.
 The president will ask the commission to recommend by December a plan to balance the budget by the 2015 fiscal year, not counting interest payments on the national debt. But that still would leave a deficit of nearly 3 percent of gross domestic product -- reflecting just how large a share of the budget the debt costs are growing to be.
 Congressional Democratic leaders have committed to hold a vote on whatever plan a commission produces.
 Robert Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which supports lower deficits, said that because of the quick opposition in Congress to many of the proposed spending cuts and tax increases, ''I found myself concluding that I was glad that they did not propose more deficit reduction.''
 ''You are better off trying to find out if there's any chance that some things can emerge on a bipartisan basis from the commission,'' Mr. Greenstein said, ''rather than throwing them out there and having them killed off first so that the commission effectively can't even consider them.''

HEADLINE: Citing Cost Overruns, Pentagon Makes Shift on a Fighter

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and THOM SHANKER; James Dao contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Monday that he was replacing the general in charge of the Pentagon's largest weapons program -- the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter -- and withholding $614 million in award fees from the contractor, Lockheed Martin.
 The surprise announcement came from a Pentagon chief who has sought to impose accountability across the department's senior leadership and who himself had promoted plans for the new plane last year in persuading Congress to kill the more expensive F-22 fighter jet. But a special Pentagon review team has since warned of possibly billions of dollars in cost overruns on the plane, and Mr. Gates announced that he was restructuring the program and requiring the company to cover some of the extra costs.
 Mr. Gates disclosed the reshuffling on the F-35 program as he released the Pentagon's proposed $708.3 billion spending package for the fiscal year 2011.
 After a dramatic first year in which the Obama administration killed the F-22 and other expensive weapons programs, the Pentagon presented a new budget that includes a $14.8 billion increase over the current spending totals. Perhaps more important in the long term, the proposed spending plan represents a consolidation of Mr. Gates's desire to add money to try to win today's wars rather than spending as much on future weaponry. 
 The proposed increases reflect the rising cost of the war in Afghanistan and a push by military leaders to keep their basic budget growing faster than inflation.
 Some of the extra money is intended to pay for helicopters needed to transport troops in rugged environments, for unmanned planes to provide surveillance on enemy movements and for more Special Operations forces needed in Afghanistan and a mix of other possible wars. Those spending priorities are explained in a new war-fighting strategy review that the Pentagon also released on Monday.
 But the increases come at a time when President Obama has frozen spending on many domestic programs, and many Democrats in Congress could find them hard to take politically. 
 And while Mr. Gates said Lockheed Martin had agreed to absorb part of the cost overruns on the Joint Strike Fighter, industry consultants said other military companies were delighted that, once again, a long-expected turndown in military spending had not hit. 
 ''The defense industry is pleased but bemused,'' said Loren Thompson, the chief operating officer at the Lexington Institute, a policy group financed partly by military contractors. ''It's been telling itself for years that when the Democrats got control it would be bad news for weapons programs. But the spending keeps going on.''
 All told, the administration said Monday that it wanted to increase the Pentagon's regular spending by 3.4 percent, to $548.9 billion in the 2011 fiscal year from $530.8 billion this year. It also asked Congress to approve $159.3 billion for next year to cover the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
 The White House said it was also seeking an additional $33 billion now to pay for the 30,000 extra troops being sent to Afghanistan. That would bring the total war spending for this year to $162.6 billion.
 Mr. Gates said the program manager on the F-35, Maj. Gen. David Heinz of the Marine Corps, would be replaced by a higher-ranking general whose name would be announced soon.
 ''A number of key goals and benchmarks were not met,'' he said, adding that ''the taxpayer should not have to bear the entire burden of getting the J.S.F. program back on track.''
 In a statement issued late Monday, Lockheed Martin said it had been working with military officials ''on a plan to get the program back on track'' and was ''committed to stabilizing F-35 cost, affordability and to fielding the aircraft on time.''
 Mr. Gates said he planned to extend the development phase by a year. Pentagon officials said they would delay the purchase of 122 planes and expand the flight testing to try to avoid much of the $16 billion in cost overruns that the review team had projected. 
 The Air Force, the Navy and the Marines plan to buy 2,400 of the planes over the next 25 years, and eight allied nations have also invested in the project. 
 Mr. Gates also said he would try again to kill two programs -- the C-17 cargo plane and an alternate engine for the F-35 -- that Congress saved last year. 
 The new Defense Department spending proposal and the strategy reviews, Mr. Gates said, ''are shaped by a bracing dose of realism -- realism with regard to risk, realism with regard to resources.'' 
 ''We have, in a sober and clear-eyed way, assessed risk, set priorities, made tradeoffs and identified requirements based on plausible, real-world threats, scenarios and potential adversaries,'' he said. 
 To calm critics who might argue that his emphasis on winning today's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan put future American security at risk, Mr. Gates noted that his budget had shifted only 7 percent to 10 percent of spending to today's missions and needs, and that 40 percent would pay for weapons that can fight all types of wars. That leaves half the budget still devoted to traditional threats.
 Every four years, Congress requires the Pentagon to produce its Quadrennial Defense Review, an assessment of long-range strategy and the budgets to pay for them. In unveiling the review Monday, Michele A. Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy, said the strategy document for the first time jettisoned a historic planning requirement that the American military prepare to fight two major conventional wars at the same time.
 Instead, the Pentagon's new strategy calls on the military to prepare for a much broader -- and more complicated -- set of national security requirements, that may include traditional combat against a state adversary, operations against foreign terrorists, counter-insurgency efforts, missions to mitigate natural or terrorist disasters at home and operations in cyberspace.
 With a record number of veterans projected to use its health care system, the Department of Veterans Affairs has requested a $125 billion budget for 2011, a 10 percent increase. The department proposed creating more than 4,000 new permanent positions to help process a backlog of disability claims.
 That backlog is expected to increase with new claims not only from Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, but also from Vietnam-era veterans with diseases related to exposure to Agent Orange, the chemical defoliant. The department is also requesting $13.7 billion in one-time spending for the current year to pay retroactive claims for three diseases it now presumes to be caused by Agent Orange: Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease and hairy-cell leukemia.

HEADLINE: Panel Suggests 100 Ways Buildings Can Be Greener

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
A panel of experts convened by the mayor and City Council issued more than 100 recommendations Monday on how to make New York City's building codes more environmentally sound by imposing energy-saving requirements on construction and renovation work. 
 The measures, presented to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the Council's speaker, Christine C. Quinn, include rules for insulating glass skyscrapers and a plan that would place temperature controls in individual apartments, eliminating the winter ritual of opening windows to vent excess heat. 
 Many of the proposals would need to be approved by the City Council.
 ''A lot of these are incremental gains, but together they amount to a big gain,'' said the panel's chairman, Russell Unger, the executive director of the New York chapter of the United States Green Building Council, which certifies green design and construction. ''By changing code, everybody can have lower utility bills.''
 The recommendations are the city's latest attempt to reduce the greenhouse gases produced by its buildings, which are estimated to be the source of about 75 percent of the city's emissions over all. In December, the City Council passed legislation requiring owners of New York's largest buildings to pay for energy audits, upgrade lighting and take other steps to reduce energy consumption.
 But as with previous green proposals for buildings, many of the improvements suggested on Monday could substantially increase the costs of renovation or construction. 
 The panel of experts, including representatives of the building industry and from environmental groups, said at a briefing that the city must find ways to secure financing and offer other incentives to help developers and managers make the changes.
 ''In general, the industry supports the overall goal,'' said Charlotte Matthews, vice president for sustainability at the Related Companies, a major New York developer that has a representative on the task force. 
 She noted that some measures would be less palatable than others, and that in difficult economic times ''any change is a little unnerving.'' 
 But she said a stiffer code regulating buildings' energy use was essential in meeting the city's long-term environmental demands and ''ensuring that all New Yorkers have a healthy home, school and workplace.''
 The panel's wish list includes requiring all commercial and residential buildings that are four stories or taller to meet the nation's latest energy standards. Other proposals call for such buildings to be more airtight and to have minimal insulation. 
 One proposal would impose higher efficiency standards for heating systems and ban inefficient boilers in the city's largest buildings. Another would phase in individual apartment temperature controls over a 10-year period.
 Ms. Quinn said about half of the measures would not involve significant expenditures. The real estate industry's participation in the process should help address concerns about costs, she added. 
 ''It's kind of a new way of looking at how we do business with a green perspective,'' she said.
 In a statement, Mayor Bloomberg said the recommendations by the panel, which was convened 18 months ago, were critical to meeting the city's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2030.

HEADLINE: At Issue: Counting The Jobs Created

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
As the Obama administration begins talking to Congress about a new jobs bill, it is still having trouble saying with precision how many jobs have been spurred so far by last year's effort, the $787 billion stimulus package that was designed to create or save 3.5 million jobs over two years.
 Over the weekend, in fact, the administration released the latest figures showing the impact of the stimulus package on jobs, announcing that nearly 600,000 jobs had been financed directly in the fourth quarter of 2009. But it changed the definition of those jobs, making it hard for Congress or the public to keep score and learn how the stimulus is doing. 
 From February to September, the administration had said, more than 640,000 jobs were saved or created. But in the final quarter of 2009, the administration no longer asked recipients whether all of those jobs were actually created or saved by the stimulus money or whether some of those jobs might have existed without the stimulus money.
 Instead, it now simply counts all existing jobs paid for with stimulus money as saved jobs, whether or not they would have been lost without the money.
 The new, more expansive definition will make it more difficult to isolate the effects of the stimulus law, which is officially called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but should make it easier for states and employers to calculate jobs. But the new definition also means that the new tally of 599,108 jobs reported in the fourth quarter cannot be compared with the earlier figures from 2009.
 Figuring out whether jobs were actually created or saved by the stimulus ultimately proved too subjective, officials said. The Obama administration originally asked states and employers receiving stimulus money to file reports detailing how many jobs they had created, and how many jobs they had been able to retain ''that would not have continued to be filled'' without the stimulus money. 
 But when the recipients filed their first reports last fall, some decided to count nearly every job that was paid for with stimulus money as a ''saved'' job, while others only counted the jobs that would have actually been lost without the money. Their job tallies varied wildly, even for similar work paid for with similar amounts of money.
 Even with the new, simplified definition, there was some confusion.
 California, for example, reported financing 71,015 jobs with stimulus money in the fourth quarter, but its Department of Education, which is claiming nearly half of those jobs, used the old jobs formula. There was even some confusion about how much money the state had actually received: while the state originally reported receiving nearly $8.2 billion through the end of September, it reported that through the end of the year it had received only $7.8 billion; a state official cited changing definitions of what it meant to actually ''receive'' money.
 Economists generally agree that the stimulus has increased the nation's economic output. The jobs counted by recipients do not include jobs spurred indirectly by tax cuts or other aid; the White House estimated last month that between 1.5 million and 2 million jobs could be attributed to the stimulus package. But with the unemployment rate at 10 percent by the end of the year, higher than the worst-case scenario the White House forecast when it proposed the stimulus, skepticism about the stimulus's effectiveness has remained high.
 Stung by a storm of criticism this fall after numerous errors in the jobs reports were publicized, the White House released the latest figures quietly. This time there was no news conference, as there was last time, but rather a statement late Saturday night from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. stating that the stimulus was on track.

HEADLINE: Afghan Official Dismisses Taliban's Denial of Talks

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; Abdul Waheed Wafa contributed reporting from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The Afghan official in charge of reconciliation acknowledged Monday that the government had been in talks for some time with Taliban leaders to bring them into the government and end the war, dismissing the Taliban's denials.
 The official -- Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, a top security adviser to President Hamid Karzai -- made the statement at a news conference to discuss last week's international Afghanistan conference in London and later elaborated on his announcement in an interview. 
 ''There are some contacts and these contacts will continue, on the local, regional, national and broader political level, but it's too early to speak about the outcome of these contacts,'' Mr. Stanekzai said in response to a question on whether the government was in talks with Taliban leaders. 
 Later, in the interview, he dismissed Taliban denials of any such contacts. ''They are continuing to say this, but it's something they say in the media, but this is not a fact,'' he said.
 Mr. Karzai has said he would welcome talks with top Taliban figures like their leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. 
 American officials, while supporting the Afghan government's reconciliation efforts, have ruled out talking to hard-liners like Mullah Omar, whom they see as too close to Al Qaeda.
 Mr. Stanekzai declined to say specifically with whom the government was negotiating. ''It's too early to say; it will ignite a lot of confusion,'' he said. ''We need a space for confidence building.'' 
 The government is still working out the details of specific proposals to ensure security and jobs for Taliban members who change sides. Once those plans have been revealed, he said, ''Then we can talk about this in more detail.''
 In addition, Mr. Stanekzai said, many of the Taliban leaders were fearful of retaliation from other Taliban members. ''We have to respect their safety as well,'' he said.
 At the London conference last Thursday, which brought together 50 allied and donor countries, reconciliation with and reintegration of insurgents was one of the leading topics. Mr. Karzai publicly invited the Taliban to join talks with the government, and said they would be included at a nationwide tribal assembly he has scheduled in six weeks.
 Officials make a distinction between ''reconciliation,'' or talking to the Taliban leadership, and ''reintegration,'' which involves persuading lower-level followers to change sides. Both efforts, however, include providing positions and jobs to insurgents who change sides. The American military has been much more actively involved in reintegration efforts. 
 Last month, Kai Eide, the United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, met with a group of Taliban representatives, according to American and United Nations officials. Taliban leadership denied the reports. 
 ''The leadership council once again emphasizes the continuation of the Islamic jihad against all invaders,'' the Taliban said in a statement. 
 ''If they deny the peace process, they are against the nation of Afghanistan,'' Mr. Stanekzai said. ''In Afghanistan, nobody is against the peace process. How could they stand against the peace process?''
 There have been no formal peace negotiations since the war began in 2001. Publicly, the Taliban refuse to talk to the government until all foreign forces leave, while the government insists that the Taliban accept the Afghan Constitution.
 At Monday's news conference, also attended by the foreign and defense ministers as well as other officials, Mr. Stanekzai said, ''We are working to find a way out of this that is not just military.''
 As a part of that, he said, the government is ''willing to incorporate various groups into Afghanistan's government.'' Also on Monday, Haider Reza, the director of the Mine Action Coordination Center of Afghanistan, which is financed by the United Nations, announced that the Afghan government would not be able to meet its mine-clearing goals because donor countries had not released all the money set aside for the work. 
 The country has received only $163 million of the $242 million pledged for the program year that begins March 21, Mr. Reza said. 
 Afghanistan and the international community pledged in 2006 to clear 70 percent of all mines by 2011 and 100 percent by 2013. ''I can already now say Afghanistan will be forced to ask for an extension,'' he said.
 Mr. Reza attributed the shortfall to budgetary problems in donor countries stemming from the economic crisis. He said security problems in some parts of Afghanistan were also a problem.
 In southern Afghanistan, three suicide bombers attempted to enter the Kabul Bank building in Qalat, the capital of Zabul Province, where police officers were lined up to receive their monthly pay. Police officers fired on them and two of the attackers detonated their explosives while the third escaped, according to Muhammad Jan Rasolyar, a spokesman for the provincial government. 
 One police officer was slightly wounded. 
 The international forces reported that three soldiers were killed Monday, two in southern Afghanistan during a firefight and another from a roadside bomb in western Afghanistan. The soldiers' nationalities were not identified. 
 A United States soldier was killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan on Monday, according to a news release from the American-led NATO coalition. Thirty American soldiers died last month, according to the Web site of icasualties.org, an independent organization that tracks military casualties, double the 15 who died the previous January. Fifteen other allied soldiers also died last month.
 Seven Taliban insurgents were reported killed in Helmand Province after a NATO airstrike on a safe house in Musa Qala District during an operation with the Afghan Army, said Gen. Sher Mohammed Zazai, the Afghan National Army commander in the neighboring province of Kandahar.

HEADLINE: Flock Is Now a Fight Team in Some Ministries

BYLINE: By R. M. SCHNEIDERMAN

DATELINE: MEMPHIS 

 BODY:
In the back room of a theater on Beale Street, John Renken, 42, a pastor, recently led a group of young men in prayer. 
 ''Father, we thank you for tonight,'' he said. ''We pray that we will be a representation of you.''
 An hour later, a member of his flock who had bowed his head was now unleashing a torrent of blows on an opponent, and Mr. Renken was offering guidance that was not exactly prayerful. 
 ''Hard punches!'' he shouted from the sidelines of a martial arts event called Cage Assault. ''Finish the fight! To the head! To the head!'' 
 The young man was a member of a fight team at Xtreme Ministries, a small church near Nashville that doubles as a mixed martial arts academy. Mr. Renken, who founded the church and academy, doubles as the team's coach. The school's motto is ''Where Feet, Fist and Faith Collide.''
 Mr. Renken's ministry is one of a small but growing number of evangelical churches that have embraced mixed martial arts -- a sport with a reputation for violence and blood that combines kickboxing, wrestling and other fighting styles -- to reach and convert young men, whose church attendance has been persistently low. Mixed martial arts events have drawn millions of television viewers, and one was the top pay-per-view event in 2009.
 Recruitment efforts at the churches, which are predominantly white, involve fight night television viewing parties and lecture series that use ultimate fighting to explain how Christ fought for what he believed in. Other ministers go further, hosting or participating in live events.
 The goal, these pastors say, is to inject some machismo into their ministries -- and into the image of Jesus -- in the hope of making Christianity more appealing. ''Compassion and love -- we agree with all that stuff, too,'' said Brandon Beals, 37, the lead pastor at Canyon Creek Church outside of Seattle. ''But what led me to find Christ was that Jesus was a fighter.''
 The outreach is part of a larger and more longstanding effort on the part of some ministers who fear that their churches have become too feminized, promoting kindness and compassion at the expense of strength and responsibility. 
 ''The man should be the overall leader of the household,'' said Ryan Dobson, 39, a pastor and fan of mixed martial arts who is the son of James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, a prominent evangelical group. ''We've raised a generation of little boys.'' 
 These pastors say the marriage of faith and fighting is intended to promote Christian values, quoting verses like ''fight the good fight of faith'' from Timothy 6:12. Several put the number of churches taking up mixed martial arts at roughly 700 of an estimated 115,000 white evangelical churches in America. The sport is seen as a legitimate outreach tool by the youth ministry affiliate of the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents more than 45,000 churches.
 ''You have a lot of troubled young men who grew up without fathers, and they're wandering and they're hopeless and they're lousy dads themselves and they're just lost,'' said Paul Robie, 54, a pastor at South Mountain Community Church in Draper, Utah. 
 Fighting as a metaphor has resonated with some young men. 
 ''I'm fighting to provide a better quality of life for my family and provide them with things that I didn't have growing up,'' said Mike Thompson, 32, a former gang member and student of Mr. Renken's who until recently had struggled with unemployment and who fights under the nickname the Fury. ''Once I accepted Christ in my life,'' Mr. Thompson said, ''I realized that a person can fight for good.'' 
 Nondenominational evangelical churches have a long history of using popular culture -- rock music, skateboarding and even yoga -- to reach new followers. Yet even among more experimental sects, mixed martial arts has critics. 
 ''What you attract people to Christ with is also what you need to get people to stay,'' said Eugene Cho, 39, a pastor at Quest Church, an evangelical congregation in Seattle. ''I don't live for the Jesus who eats red meat, drinks beer and beats on other men.''
 Robert Brady, 49, the executive vice president of a conservative evangelical group, the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, agreed, saying that the mixed martial arts motif of evangelism ''so easily takes away from the real focus of the church, which is the Gospel.'' Many black churches have chosen not to participate.
 Almost a decade ago, mixed martial arts was seen as a blood sport without rules or regulation. It was banned in nearly every state and denounced by politicians like Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
 Over the past five years, however, because of shrewd marketing by the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the sport's premier brand, mixed martial arts has become mainstream. Today the sport is legal and regulated in 42 states.
 Its proponents point to a study by researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine showing that mixed martial arts participants suffer a lower rate of knockouts than boxers. 
 Over the past year and a half, a subculture has evolved, with Christian mixed martial arts clothing brands like Jesus Didn't Tap (in the sport, ''tap'' means to give up) and Christian social networking Web sites like Anointedfighter.com. 
 Roughly 100 young men, many sporting shaved heads and tattoos, attend fight parties at Canyon Creek near Seattle, watching bouts on the church's four big-screen televisions. Vendors hustle hot dogs and ''Predestined to Fight'' T-shirts. About half are not church members but heard about the parties through friends, said Mr. Beals, who is known as the Fight Pastor. 
 Men ages 18 to 34 are absent from churches, some pastors said, because churches have become more amenable to women and children. ''We grew up in a church that had pastel pews,'' said Tom Skiles, 37, the pastor of Spirit of St. Louis Church in Arnold, Mo. ''The men fell asleep.''
 In focusing on the toughness of Christ, evangelical leaders are harking back to a similar movement in the early 1900s, historians say, when women began entering the work force. Proponents of this so-called muscular Christianity advocated weight lifting as a way for Christians to express their masculinity. 
 ''This whole generation is raised on the idea that they're in a culture war for the heart and soul of America,'' said Stephen Prothero, a professor of religion at Boston University. 
 Paul Burress, 35, a chaplain and fight coach at Victory Baptist Church in Rochester, said mixed martial arts had given his students a chance to work on body, soul and spirit. ''Win or lose, we represent Jesus,'' he said. ''And we win most of the time.''
 But on that cold night in Memphis, Mr. Renken, the pastor from Xtreme Ministries, watched as two of his three fighters were beaten, one emerging with a broken ankle.
 Another, Jesse Johnson, 20, a potential convert, was subdued in a chokehold and decided not to return home with the other church members after his bout. He stayed in Memphis, drinking and carousing with friends along Beale Street, this city's raucous, neon-lighted strip of bars.

HEADLINE: The Geezers' Crusade

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
We like to think that in days gone by, the young venerated the elderly. But that wasn't always so. In ''As You Like It,'' Shakespeare's morose character, Jaques, calls old age ''second childishness and mere oblivion.'' Walt Whitman hoped that the tedium and pettiness of his senior years would not infect his poetry.
 Developmental psychologists, when they treated old age at all, often regarded it as a period of withdrawal. The elderly slowly separate themselves from the world. They cannot be expected to achieve new transformations. ''About the age of fifty,'' Freud wrote, ''the elasticity of the mental processes on which treatment depends is, as a rule, lacking. Old people are no longer educable.'' 
 Well, that was wrong. Over the past few years, researchers have found that the brain is capable of creating new connections and even new neurons all through life. While some mental processes -- like working memory and the ability to quickly solve math problems -- clearly deteriorate, others do not. Older people retain their ability to remember emotionally nuanced events. They are able to integrate memories from their left and right hemispheres. Their brains reorganize to help compensate for the effects of aging.
 A series of longitudinal studies, begun decades ago, are producing a rosier portrait of life after retirement. These studies don't portray old age as surrender or even serenity. They portray it as a period of development -- and they're not even talking about uber-oldsters jumping out of airplanes.
 People are most unhappy in middle age and report being happier as they get older. This could be because as people age they pay less attention to negative emotional stimuli, according to a study by the psychologists Mara Mather, Turhan Canli and others.
 Gender roles begin to merge. Many women get more assertive while many men get more emotionally attuned. Personalities often become more vivid as people become more of what they already are. Norma Haan of the University of California, Berkeley, and others conducted a 50-year follow-up of people who had been studied while young and concluded that the subjects had become more outgoing, self-confident and warm with age.
 The research paints a comforting picture. And the nicest part is that virtue is rewarded. One of the keys to healthy aging is what George Vaillant of Harvard calls ''generativity'' -- providing for future generations. Seniors who perform service for the young have more positive lives and better marriages than those who don't. As Vaillant writes in his book ''Aging Well,'' ''Biology flows downhill.'' We are naturally inclined to serve those who come after and thrive when performing that role.
 The odd thing is that when you turn to political life, we are living in an age of reverse-generativity. Far from serving the young, the old are now taking from them. First, they are taking money. According to Julia Isaacs of the Brookings Institution, the federal government now spends $7 on the elderly for each $1 it spends on children.
 Second, they are taking freedom. In 2009, for the first time in American history, every single penny of federal tax revenue went to pay for mandatory spending programs, according to Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute. As more money goes to pay off promises made mostly to the old, the young have less control.
 Third, they are taking opportunity. For decades, federal spending has hovered around 20 percent of G.D.P. By 2019, it is forecast to be at 25 percent and rising. The higher tax rates implied by that spending will mean less growth and fewer opportunities. Already, pension costs in many states are squeezing education spending.
 In the private sphere, in other words, seniors provide wonderful gifts to their grandchildren, loving attention that will linger in young minds, providing support for decades to come. In the public sphere, they take it away.
 I used to think that political leaders could avert fiscal suicide. But it's now clear change will not be led from Washington. On the other hand, over the past couple of years we've seen the power of spontaneous social movements: first the movement that formed behind Barack Obama, and now, equally large, the Tea Party movement.
 Spontaneous social movements can make the unthinkable thinkable, and they can do it quickly. It now seems clear that the only way the U.S. is going to avoid an economic crisis is if the oldsters take it upon themselves to arise and force change. The young lack the political power. Only the old can lead a generativity revolution -- millions of people demanding changes in health care spending and the retirement age to make life better for their grandchildren.
 It may seem unrealistic -- to expect a generation to organize around the cause of nonselfishness. But in the private sphere, you see it every day. Old people now have the time, the energy and, with the Internet, the tools to organize.
 The elderly. They are our future.

HEADLINE: Weight of a Bubble

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
The Great Bailout is mostly over for the banks. But for those troubled behemoths of the nation's housing bust, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the lifeline from Washington just keeps getting longer.
 Fifteen months after Fannie and Freddie were effectively nationalized, neither the Obama administration nor Congressional leaders see a quick solution to one of the thorniest problems in American finance: how to fix the twin mortgage giants without choking the flow of credit to homeowners and dealing a blow to a still-fragile housing market. 
 The administration had said for months that it would begin charting a new course for Fannie and Freddie when it released its budget proposal on Monday. The companies, crucial pillars of American housing, already have consumed over $112 billion of taxpayer dollars. 
 Bankers, builders and homeowners stand to win or lose from any plan for the two so-called government-sponsored enterprises, or G.S.E.'s. But, on Monday, that plan amounted to a single, ambiguous sentence from the White House: 
 ''The administration continues to monitor the situation of the G.S.E.'s closely and will continue to provide updates on considerations for longer-term reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as appropriate.''
 Treasury officials say more details may be forthcoming, although they decline to say when. To many experts, however, the message is that Fannie and Freddie are likely to remain wards of the state for years. 
 And, given the alarm in some quarters over the mounting budget deficit, these two giants and their vast obligations are likely to remain conveniently -- and controversially -- off the federal books. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have obligations of $3.9 trillion to investors who bought bundles of mortgages that the companies assembled. 
 Powerful and often competing interests are grappling over the companies' futures. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, eager to demonstrate their scorn for the companies, have called for their eradication. But few policy makers are willing to take aggressive steps that might weaken the housing market. On Christmas Eve, the White House quietly disclosed that it had, in effect, given the companies a blank check by making their federal credit line unlimited; the ceiling had been $400 billion.
 For decades, Fannie and Freddie have played a central role in the housing market. But when the market began falling apart in 2008, so many of the home loans that Fannie and Freddie had bought or guaranteed went bad that the companies nearly went bankrupt. The government essentially took them over. 
 Today, many financial companies are pushing to shrink or even dismantle the two G.S.E.'s in hopes of expanding their own businesses into the resulting vacuum. Financial executives contend that the government does not belong in the housing market. Given the animosity directed at the financial industry in general, however, few will criticize the government publicly. 
 ''Almost no other country has companies like Fannie and Freddie, where the government essentially competes with private banks,'' said one executive who was not authorized to speak to the media or willing to publicly criticize any government decisions.
 ''People still manage to buy houses in France and England,'' the executive continued. ''One of the attractions of abolishing Fannie and Freddie is that a source of competition is gone. But, by the same token, if Fannie and Freddie hadn't existed, maybe things wouldn't have gotten so out of hand in the first place.''
 Others disagree -- often also for reasons of self-interest. The construction and real estate industries, two powerful political constituencies, essentially want to preserve the status quo so that their customers, homebuyers, can continue buying homes. 
 ''If the government isn't involved, you run the risk of the secondary mortgage market drying up at exactly the wrong time,'' said Jerry Giovaniello, the chief lobbyist for the National Association of Realtors. ''Private companies get tighter with money when things get bad. The government is the only one who can make sure capital continues flowing.'' 
 Shading all of this is election-year politics. In a polarized Washington, Democrats and Republicans seem to agree that flogging Fannie and Freddie might play well to an electorate weary of costly bailouts and anxious about the rising national debt. 
 The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has pledged to propose ''detailed reforms'' this year. Democrats and Republicans in Congress are scheduling hearings. Politicians from both parties have demanded the eradication of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 But for now, the only real consensus is that no one quite knows what to do with the companies. Whatever happens is almost certain to determine which Americans can -- and cannot -- get mortgages, and how much those loans will cost. That, in turn, will most likely influence home values for decades. 
 And so, despite talk of dislodging political gridlock in Washington, many policy makers seem happy to put off making any real decisions. Many policy makers concede that there are no easy options. Trying to reinvent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they say, could push the housing market into even more dire straits.
 ''I've said we should abolish Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in their current form and come up with a whole new system of housing finance,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ''I can't say when. And I don't have any idea what that new system will look like. No one, I believe, knows. All we really know is that we need something new.''
 Indeed, most of the recent enthusiasm for public discussions about Fannie and Freddie have been attempts by both parties to gain political advantage. Aides to high-ranking Republican and Democratic lawmakers say that opinion polls suggest that independent voters are unlikely to support candidates who defend Fannie and Freddie. 
 Republicans are trying to emphasize the companies' longtime Democratic ties. They attacked the Treasury Department in December when the government announced multimillion-dollar pay packages for the companies' top executives. 
 ''Awarding millions of dollars in bonuses on the taxpayers' dime is unconscionable,'' Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, wrote to the Treasury secretary in a letter signed by 70 Republicans. 
 On Monday, after the White House announced it did not yet have a firm plan for the companies, Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama, said, ''It is irresponsible for the administration to give Fannie and Freddie a blank check and offer no strategy for reforming the G.S.E.'s.''
 To counter such salvos, Democratic lawmakers are now searching for opportunities to publicly distance themselves from Fannie and Freddie. 
 ''We're going to provide a lot of chances for Democrats to vote against Fannie and Freddie and to openly criticize them,'' said a Congressional staff member working for a high-ranking Democrat. ''Everyone is going to get a chance to say something bad about the companies if they want to, and we're going to make sure the volume is up on the microphone.''
 The White House, already under attack for mounting debts, has so far disregarded advice from the Congressional Budget Office to fold the costs associated with Fannie and Freddie into the budget. In Monday's statement, the administration emphasized that because Fannie and Freddie may one day come out from under government control, they should stay off the books. 
 Meantime, everyone is waiting for the big fix.
 ''No one has come up with a new model that can both maintain liquidity and eliminate all the bad or conflicting incentives that caused the crisis in the first place,'' said Thomas A. Lawler, an economist who worked at Fannie Mae for more than two decades before leaving in 2006 to become a consultant. ''And the longer the government relies on entities like Fannie and Freddie to implement the recovery, the harder it is to get rid of them. This is a really, really hard problem, and it's going to take a long time to figure out the right solution.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama's New Budget

 BODY:
President Obama got his priorities mostly right in the new $3.8 trillion budget for the fiscal year 2011. It calls for increased spending on education and clean energy technology, shows some restraint on the defense budget, and, most importantly, calls for more spending on job creation. It also rightly lets the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income Americans expire as scheduled at the end of 2010. 
 When all the new spending and spending cuts are added in, and various tax increases and tax cuts are accounted for, the increase in the deficit, compared with what it would have been without any changes, is $120 billion. That is a lot of money. But it is not too much at a time of economic weakness, when deficit spending is needed to boost growth and put Americans back to work. 
 Still, if you're feeling sticker shock, we are, too. It is important to remember that most of that $3.8 trillion, nearly $2.4 trillion, is for mandatory spending -- on programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and for interest on the national debt. Medicare and Medicaid alone will cost $788 billion; that should be another reminder of why the country needs health care reform. 
 Congress also cannot waste any more time posturing about the deficit rather than doing what is needed to get Americans back to work. 
 In his budget, Mr. Obama has called for $100 billion in sound new job-creating measures, including tax credits for hiring and new investments in green jobs and infrastructure projects. The budget also proposes spending $166 billion for other job-related initiatives, including nearly $50 billion to extend federal unemployment benefits this year. 
 Millions of families need those benefits to meet their basic needs. And without their spending, more American businesses would face hardship, leading to more layoffs and ever higher unemployment. 
 The House passed a $154 billion jobs bill late last year that incorporates some of the president's ideas. In the Senate, all of the Republicans and a handful of Democrats have balked, insisting that they are far more concerned about adding to the deficit. That is a false and dangerous economy. No one can be happy about the $1.3 trillion deficit projected for 2011. Still, Mr. Obama's budget calls for steps to begin to chip away at it.
 The budget rightly calls on the country's high-income earners and wealthy corporations -- the big energy companies and the banks, all cosseted during the Bush years -- to carry more of the burden. Letting the Bush-era tax cuts on the rich expire at the end of this year would bring in nearly $700 billion over a decade. A fee on big banks would raise $90 billion in that time, and an elimination of some subsidies for large energy companies would raise another $40 billion. 
 Mr. Obama is right that the recovery is too fragile to make deep cuts in government spending. But his proposal to freeze nonsecurity discretionary spending, starting next year, is a credible commitment to find more serious savings once the economy rebounds. 
 The fact is, there is not enough money in any of the discretionary accounts to wrestle the deficit under control. For that, the nation needs health care reform and tax reform, including new sources of tax revenue. 
 The alternative to spending more today on job creation is a prolonged downturn, or worse, renewed recession -- which would only force deficits higher. In the medium- and long-term, the country must deal with the deficit and the structural problems that threaten everyone's economic future. Mr. Obama's budget is a step in the right direction for both problems. Now he must press Congress to do its part.

HEADLINE: Extra Money for Science in Obama's Budget

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Calming fears that scientific research would be hurt by the Obama administration, the budget request for the Department of Health and Human Services was $81.3 billion, up from $79.6 billion a year ago. And the National Institutes of Health saw its budget request rise by $1 billion, to $32 billion, more than was requested last year. 
 The proposed budget, announced on Monday, now includes $6 billion for cancer research, intended to allow the agency to start 30 new drug trials and double the number of drugs and vaccines in clinical trials by 2016.
 The first priority noted by the Office of Management and Budget was to support health insurance reform by strengthening policy on the use of computerized records, financing research to compare the effectiveness of different medical treatments and creating health centers to get more care to populations that lack it, like the uninsured and American Indians.
 In other science-related budget requests, the National Science Foundation would get $7.4 billion, a nearly 8 percent increase from the budget last year.
 Scientists had feared that budgets would be frozen and that stimulus financing that had been directed toward science would dry up in the coming fiscal year.
 Separately, the State Department, through its own budget and that of the United States Agency for International Development, pours billions of dollars into global health. That money increased nearly 9 percent in the Mr. Obama's budget request, rising to $8.5 billion this year from $7.8 billion, according to the department's budget summary.
 In her own preliminary analysis, Jennifer Kates, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which specializes in health policy, said the amount of money devoted to programs in the president's Global Health Initiative, which is split among several agencies, appeared to have risen about 8 percent to $9.6 billion, from $8.8 billion in fiscal 2010. 
 The key areas that were getting increases, Ms. Kates said, were the health of mothers and children, malaria, family planning and neglected tropical diseases. Financing for AIDS appears to be rising but not nearly as rapidly as it did during the Bush administration, which created the president's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.
 ''It's what they've been talking about,'' she said. 
 While scientists concentrating on domestic problems had worried about deep cuts, global health appears to have been sheltered by Mr. Obama's promise to exempt international affairs and global security.
 Also interesting, she said, was a plan to name 20 ''Global Health Plus'' countries by April that would get more help than others.

HEADLINE: A Red-Ink Decade

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In a federal budget filled with mind-boggling statistics, two numbers stand out as particularly stunning, for the way they may change American politics and American power.
 The first is the projected deficit in the coming year, nearly 11 percent of the country's entire economic output. That is not unprecedented: During the Civil War, World War I and World War II, the United States ran soaring deficits, but usually with the expectation that they would come back down once peace was restored and war spending abated.
 But the second number, buried deeper in the budget's projections, is the one that really commands attention: By President Obama's own optimistic projections, American deficits will not return to what are widely considered sustainable levels over the next 10 years. In fact, in 2019 and 2020 -- years after Mr. Obama has left the political scene, even if he serves two terms -- they start rising again sharply, to more than 5 percent of gross domestic product. His budget draws a picture of a nation that like many American homeowners simply cannot get above water. 
 For Mr. Obama and his successors, the effect of those projections is clear: Unless miraculous growth, or miraculous political compromises, creates some unforeseen change over the next decade, there is virtually no room for new domestic initiatives for Mr. Obama or his successors. Beyond that lies the possibility that the United States could begin to suffer the same disease that has afflicted Japan over the past decade. As debt grew more rapidly than income, that country's influence around the world eroded. 
 Or, as Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, used to ask before he entered government a year ago, ''How long can the world's biggest borrower remain the world's biggest power?''
 The Chinese leadership, which is lending much of the money to finance the American government's spending, and which asked pointed questions about Mr. Obama's budget when members visited Washington last summer, says it thinks the long-term answer to Mr. Summers's question is self-evident. The Europeans will also tell you that this is a big worry about the next decade.
 Mr. Obama himself hinted at his own concern when he announced in early December that he planned to send 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan, but insisted that the United States could not afford to stay for long.
 ''Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power,'' he told cadets at West Point. ''It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people, and allows investment in new industry.'' 
 And then he explained why even a ''war of necessity,'' as he called Afghanistan last summer, could not last for long. 
 ''That's why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended,'' he said then, ''because the nation that I'm most interested in building is our own.''
 Mr. Obama's budget deserves credit for its candor. It does not sugarcoat, at least excessively, the potential magnitude of the problem. President George W. Bush kept claiming, until near the end of his presidency, that he would leave office with a balanced budget. He never got close; in fact, the deficits soared in his last years.
 Mr. Obama has published the 10-year numbers in part, it seems, to make the point that the political gridlock of the past few years, in which most Republicans refuse to talk about tax increases and Democrats refuse to talk about cutting entitlement programs, is unsustainable. His prescription is that the problem has to be made worse, with intense deficit spending to lower the unemployment rate, before the deficits can come down.
 Mr. Summers, in an interview on Monday afternoon, said, ''The budget recognizes the imperatives of job creation and growth in the short run, and takes significant measures to increase confidence in the medium term.'' 
 He was referring to the freeze on domestic, non-national-security-related spending, the troubled effort to cut health care costs, and the decision to let expire Bush-era tax cuts for corporations and families earning more than $250,000. 
 But Mr. Summers said that ''through the budget and fiscal commission, the president has sought to provide maximum room for making further adjustments as necessary before any kind of crisis arrives.'' 
 Turning that thought into political action, however, has proved harder and harder for the Washington establishment. Republicans stayed largely silent about the debt during the Bush years. Democrats have described it as a necessary evil during the economic crisis that defined Mr. Obama's first year. Interest in a long-term solution seems limited. Or, as Isabel V. Sawhill of the Brookings Institution put it Monday on MSNBC, ''The problem here is not honesty, but political will.''
 One source of that absence of will is that the political warnings are contradicted by the market signals. The Treasury has borrowed money to finance the government's deficits at remarkably low rates, the strongest indicator that the markets believe they will be paid back on time and in full. 
 The absence of political will is also facilitated by the fact that, as Prof. James K. Galbraith of the University of Texas puts it, ''Forecasts 10 years out have no credibility.''
 He is right. In the early years of the Clinton administration, government projections indicated huge deficits -- over the ''sustainable'' level of 3 percent -- by 2000. But by then, Mr. Clinton was running a modest surplus of about $200 billion, a point Mr. Obama made Monday as he tried anew to remind the country that the moment was squandered when ''the previous administration and previous Congresses created an expensive new drug program, passed massive tax cuts for the wealthy, and funded two wars without paying for any of it.'' 
 But with this budget, Mr. Obama now owns this deficit. And as Mr. Galbraith pointed out, it is possible that the gloomy projections for 2020 are equally flawed.
 Simply projecting that health care costs will rise unabated is dangerous business.
 ''Much may depend on whether we put in place the financial reforms that can rebuild a functional financial system,'' Mr. Galbraith said, to finance growth in the private sector -- the kind of growth that ultimately saved Mr. Clinton from his own deficit projections. 
 His greatest hope, Mr. Galbraith said, was Stein's law, named for Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.
 Stein's law has been recited in many different versions. But all have a common theme: If a trend cannot continue, it will stop.

HEADLINE: Shares Gain on Earnings Reports And Signs of Stability in Housing

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
 Investors rallied on Tuesday behind signs of stability in the housing sector and indications that businesses had bolstered revenue, lifting stocks for a second day.
 A stream of positive economic data this week has helped shares regain some of the losses they endured amid a steep sell-off in late January. But analysts cautioned that volatility could re-emerge as traders get more details on the state of the United States job market and Greece's debt woes later this week.
 ''This is still very cloudy water,'' said Marc Harris, co-head of global research for RBC Capital Markets. ''We know the direction of this market -- we expect it to increase 6 to 8 percent this year -- but we don't know how quickly and how consistently we are going to get there.'' 
 The source of Tuesday's momentum was the housing market, which showed signs of renewal despite its persistent struggles: consumers unwilling to make large investments, a flood of foreclosures and an influx of shaky mortgages.
 A report on pending sales of homes showed a 1 percent increase in December, after a 16 percent decline in November. Compared with a year earlier, pending sales were up 11 percent. 
 Investors welcomed the results, but there were hints of longer-term trouble. Economists said the government's efforts to prop up the housing industry through a tax credit, which expires in April, were slow to show results. ''So far, the tax credit is having hardly any effect at all,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist for IHS Global Insight. ''It's going to kick in at some point, but we're running out of time.''
 Adding to the optimism over the housing sector, the home builder D. R. Horton announced a first-quarter profit of $192 million, sending shares of the company up nearly 11 percent. The company said sales had increased 23 percent, to $1.1 billion, a welcome sign during an earnings season when investors are focusing on revenue growth.
 Ford rose 2.43 percent after the company reported sales rose 25 percent in January compared with a year earlier. Ford seemed to benefit from the cloud hanging over Toyota, which last week halted sales and production of eight models as it developed a fix for a defect in accelerator pedals. Toyota said its sales fell 16 percent in January; its shares fell 2.2 percent on Tuesday.
 The aluminum producer Alcoa rose almost 2.32 percent after it was upgraded by Citigroup, and American Express climbed 2.12 percent after Bank of America upgraded the company and said earnings would continue to grow. 
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.09 percent, or 111.32 points, at 10,296.85. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 1.3 percent, or 14.13 points, to 1,103.32, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 0.87 percent, or 18.86 points, to 2,190.06. Tuesday's gains helped solidify the largest two-day increase for stocks in nearly three months.
 As stocks rose, oil reached a two-week high, ending the day at $77.23, about 4 percent higher.
 Stocks have tumbled in recent weeks, raising concerns that the market could be headed for a decline of 10 percent or more. 
 Sean C. Kraus, chief investment officer for CitizensTrust, said investors were slowly regaining confidence.
 ''The market was way oversold, and there's definitely something of a knee-jerk reaction now on any positive news,'' Mr. Kraus said.
 On Tuesday, traders were also dissecting remarks by Paul A. Volcker, an adviser to President Obama and a former Federal Reserve chairman, who told the Senate Banking Committee that the government should more strictly regulate capital and liquidity levels. Investors have worried that Washington's crackdown on big banks might hurt future earnings.
 As stocks climbed, the dollar weakened against most world currencies, though it strengthened slightly against the euro, hovering slightly below $1.40. Gold rose about 1 percent, to $1,114.45 an ounce.
 Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32, to 97 26/32, and the yield slipped to 3.64 percent, from 3.65 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Pornography, and an Issue of Restitution at a Price Set by the Victim

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
When Amy was a little girl, her uncle made her famous in the worst way: as a star in the netherworld of child pornography. Photographs and videos known as ''the Misty series'' depicting her abuse have circulated on the Internet for more than 10 years, and often turn up in the collections of those arrested for possession of illegal images.
 Now, with the help of an inventive lawyer, the young woman known as Amy -- her real name has been withheld in court to prevent harassment -- is fighting back. 
 She is demanding that everyone convicted of possessing even a single Misty image pay her damages until her total claim of $3.4 million has been met. 
 Some experts argue that forcing payment from people who do not produce such images but only possess them goes too far. 
 In February, when the first judge arranged payment to Amy in a case in Connecticut, Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, called the decision ''highly questionable'' on his blog and said it ''stretches personal accountability to the breaking point.''
 The judge in the case acknowledged, ''We're dealing with a frontier here.'' 
 The issue is part of a larger debate over fairness in sentencing sex offenders. For years, lawmakers (and some voters) have reasoned that virtually no punishment was too severe for such criminals; even statutory limits on sentencing were often exceeded. 
 Now some courts have begun to push back, saying these heavy sentences are improper, and a new emphasis has arisen on making sex offenders pay monetary damages for their crimes. If such damages become widespread, experts say, it may make it easier to reach a consensus on measured sentencing.
 Douglas A. Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University and an expert on sentencing, said the rise in monetary damages might curb ''a troublesome modern tendency of many legislators and judges to respond to all perceived crime problems with longer and longer terms of imprisonment.'' 
 Those longer terms and conditions are already under fire. 
 On Thursday, the California Supreme Court ruled 5 to 2 that a state ballot initiative allowing the indefinite extension of sentences for sexually violent predators might violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection; the court ordered a new hearing to explore the issues. 
 On Monday, the court also asked for more study on a law that prohibits sexual predators from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park after their release from prison. The law, called Jessica's law, was approved by voters in 2006. 
 Corey Rayburn Yung, an expert in sex crimes at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, said that while ''it's hard to be too sympathetic'' toward those who possess images of child pornography, ''there is such a thing as going too far.'' The harm to child pornography victims from those who possess the images, he said, is less direct than that caused by those who abused the children. 
 The most novel approach is being taken by Amy's lawyer, James R. Marsh, whose practice focuses on child exploitation cases. Mr. Marsh's arguments are the fruits of a national movement granting greater rights to crime victims and shifting the financial burden of crimes to criminals, said Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and professor of law at the University of Utah, who advised Mr. Marsh and wrote a brief supporting his position in a Texas case.
 Amy's uncle is now in prison, but she is regularly reminded of his abuse whenever the government notifies her that her photos have turned up in yet another prosecution. More than 800 of the notices, mandated by the Crime Victims Rights Act and sent out by the federal victim notification system, have arrived at Amy's home since 2005. 
 Those notices disturb Amy when they arrive, but Mr. Marsh, looking at the same pieces of paper, saw an opportunity: he could intervene in the federal prosecutions and demand restitution. He had Amy write a victim-impact statement and hired a psychologist to evaluate her. Economists developed a tally of damages that included counseling, diminished wages and lawyer fees. The total came to $3,367,854.
 Mr. Marsh contends that every defendant should be ordered to pay the full amount, under the doctrine of joint and several liability. According to that doctrine, the recipient would stop collecting money once the full damages are paid, and those held responsible for the amount could then sue others who are found culpable for contributions. But the doctrine, which developed in civil law, does not apply as easily in criminal law, especially with an indeterminate population of defendants.
 Amy's first restitution award came in February in the Connecticut case; it involved Alan Hesketh, a British executive at the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, who paid $130,000. Since then, Mr. Marsh has automated the process and e-mailed Amy's filings to United States Attorneys in 350 cases. ''I'm able to leverage the power of the Internet to get restitution for a victim of the Internet,'' he said. 
 Mr. Marsh has, in effect, expanded his small New York law firm by hundreds of federal prosecutors. Some of them decline to file for restitution -- a judge in Minnesota ordered prosecutors to explain why -- but many have. Judges' reactions have varied, with some declining to order restitution, including one in Texas and another in Maine, usually saying that the link between possession and the harm done is too tenuous to reach the level of ''proximate harm'' generally required under the law for restitution. 
 Yet in two Florida cases, judges have ordered defendants to pay nearly the full amount requested and even more. Many judges who have considered the issues award a few thousand dollars. Even though many of the defendants have no way to pay even the smallest fine, Mr. Marsh's efforts in the first year have earned $170,000 for Amy. 
 ''This is a lawyer's dream,'' he said.
 The federal government has struggled with how to best approach the wave of new cases, and those to come. Another victim known as Vicky has begun making similar claims in court, and still more victims could come forward. Professor Berman suggested Congress would have to sort out the issue, perhaps with a victim compensation fund. 
 A memorandum last summer from a lawyer in the Administrative Office of the Courts, the federal agency that runs the judicial branch, stated that the law did not support restitution for ''mere possession.'' But Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general for the criminal division at the Justice Department, issued a letter in October stating ''we do not agree that restitution is not available to victims of the possession of child pornography as a matter of law.'' 
 Mr. Breuer urged judges not to let ''practical and administrative challenges'' to the restitution issue ''drive a policy position that directly or indirectly suggests that possession of child pornography is a victimless crime.''

HEADLINE: Some Newspapers Prepare To Charge for Web Access

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Extracting payment from online readers has been called everything from the next great folly of print journalism to its salvation, but to get a glimpse of how it really looks, head to Lancaster, Pa.
 Specifically, head to the offices of The Intelligencer Journal-Lancaster New Era, one of the first handful of news outlets to acknowledge in interviews that it intends, in the next few months, to start using a software system developed by the entrepreneurs Steven Brill, L. Gordon Crovitz and their partners, which they are calling Press+. Others interested include The Fayetteville Observer in North Carolina and GlobalPost, a news site based in Boston.
 A very small number of news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and Newsday, already charge online readers, each with a system developed largely in-house, and The New York Times announced recently that it planned to do the same. But with advertising plummeting, many other publishers eager for a new source of revenue are considering making the switch, despite the risk of losing audience and advertising.
 Last year, Mr. Brill and company seized on that interest, founding their operation, Journalism Online, with the aim of developing a highly flexible system that would become the industry standard, and keeping 20 percent of their client's online revenue as their fee. 
 They say they have worked with potential clients from around the world, most of whom they will not name, who operate more than 1,300 news sites. The News Corporation, owner of The Wall Street Journal, is also marketing an online pay system to publishers, but industry executives say that it has made little headway.
 So if it turns out that Lancaster is in the vanguard of a mass movement -- and there are plenty of skeptics who say that charging could be a short-lived experiment -- then Press+, if it works well, could be the movement's chief organizer. 
 But in their first extended interview in months, Mr. Crovitz and Mr. Brill, while offering a look at how the system works, also cautioned against high expectations and said they had urged their clients to take small steps. It will take years before charging Internet users significantly changes the economics of a deeply troubled industry, they said.
 As newsprint becomes a smaller part of the business, ''you want to establish the notion that it's worth something online,'' Mr. Brill said. ''What we have convinced people of is they don't have to make a drastic decision. You can experiment.''
 For those who have signed on, such lowered expectations are part of the appeal.
 ''We're starting small, so if this really turns people off, we're not playing with a huge chunk of our readership,'' said Ernest J. Schreiber, editor of the Lancaster paper's Web site, LancasterOnline.com. The site has been using and adapting the Press+ software for a while. He said it would go into effect in a month or two.
 At the outset, the paper, owned by a local company, Steinman Enterprises, will charge only readers outside its immediate area and only for reading obituaries, with a little green Press+ logo next to each headline covered by the system. It will allow a reader to see a certain number of obituaries free before a box pops onto the screen demanding a flat fee to keep reading, but the paper has not yet decided what that number will be, or how much it will charge.
 ''We have news that no one else has, like these obituaries,'' Mr. Schreiber said. ''We would eventually take other sections of our online content into the system. I'm thinking local sports, perhaps.''
 The system may generate only a few hundred thousand dollars a year in revenue, he said, but ''that's enough to pay for a few reporters.''
 Philip S. Balboni, president and chief executive of GlobalPost, a year-old site that focuses on international news, said it would take a different approach to using Press+. Frequent users will see messages urging them to join and pay, but it will be voluntary; there will be levels of membership with different prices, and those who do pay will be able to suggest topics for articles and have access to premium content. Those who do not join will still have access to most of the site. 
 ''We anticipate rolling it out by the end of March,'' and hope to have tens of thousands of paying readers by year's end, he said. ''By Year 2, it would become a very significant contributor to our total funding, but advertising I anticipate would still be No. 1.''
 Mr. Crovitz is a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal, where he oversaw its online pay system, and began to develop a new version of that system.
 Mr. Brill has a long record of starting ventures in untested waters, some more successful than others. He founded The American Lawyer magazine and the Court TV channel, which succeeded, and Brill's Content, a magazine about media, which did not. He also founded Verified Identity Pass, whose system, called Clear, allowed frequent travelers to speed through airport security, but he severed ties with the company before it ceased operation last year.
 Their partners in Journalism Online include Leo Hindery Jr., a former top executive at Tele-Communications Inc. and the YES Network, and Ken Ficara, who helped develop and run The Journal's Web site.
 ''We are quite a ways from widespread adoption of paid content, so it's too soon to tell how successful they'll be,'' said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla. But most publishers will not want to develop their own software systems, he said, and assuming Press+ works well, its chances of catching on ''look pretty good.''
 ''The way they have set it up, letting the publishers mix and match and design their own system, I think that's a good fit because we're in a period where newspapers are going to begin to experiment with all sorts of approaches,'' Mr. Edmonds said.
 A move to charge for content means not a single decision, but dozens. Sites can let nonpaying readers see the top of an article, while only paying readers see the whole thing; they can allow unlimited reading of certain articles, while charging for others; they can charge by the month or by the click; they can limit free reading to a certain number of articles a month; they can treat readers differently depending on their location; they can charge a single price or have a tiered system; they can give print subscribers free access or charge them, too.
 Press+ is meant to accommodate all approaches, collect data on how they work and share the results with clients. As with e-commerce systems like PayPal, a consumer who already has a Press+ account will be able to use it to gain access to additional sites without re-entering a credit card number.
 ''One of the things they're paying for is convenience and certainty,'' Mr. Crovitz said.
 Mr. Schreiber said he and his colleagues in Lancaster have no fear of playing guinea pig. If charging online turns out to be a mistake, the paper will just move on to the next experiment.
 Given the industry's troubles, ''doing nothing is not an option,'' he said. ''The sooner we can do it, the sooner we can find something that works.''

HEADLINE: When Hospitals and Insurers Tussle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Insurer vs. the Hospitals'' (editorial, Jan. 30), about a dispute between UnitedHealthcare and a group of New York hospitals over reimbursement rates:
 Your editorial appears to be evenhanded in appealing to both sides to provide better care and to control costs and premiums. But the hospitals in question are not-for-profit entities whose costs are growing, in part because of expensive but lifesaving medical technology and drugs, while reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid lags behind. The other side in the dispute is a for-profit company that pays tens of millions of dollars a year to its chief executive.
 A reasonable person may suspect that the motives of the two sides in this dispute are quite different. The goal of one is taking good care of patients, while the primary objective of the other is making profits for its shareholders. 
 Alexander Mauskop New York, Jan. 30, 2010
 The writer, a doctor, is the director of the New York Headache Center.
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial cites UnitedHealthcare's demand that the hospitals ''notify it within 24 hours when a beneficiary is admitted -- or suffer a 50 percent cut in reimbursements,'' and asks, ''How hard could it be for admissions offices to alert the insurer ... that a patient has arrived?''
 Unfortunately, the reality is not so simple. Patients often arrive in a confused or unconscious state, almost always without their insurance cards. Many people do not know the name of their insurer or whether their coverage is in force.
 Others are subject to ''carve-outs,'' have primary and secondary policies or are unaware that their Medicaid or Medicare is managed through a distinct company. Few insurers are available 24/7 to verify coverage and accept information. When insurers are open, hospital personnel spend substantial amounts of time on hold.
 Without a single-payer system, dealing with insurers requires the skills of a detective and the patience of Job. Should hospitals really be penalized for opting to care for their patients instead?
 Laura Fochtmann East Setauket, N.Y., Jan. 30, 2010
 The writer is a psychiatrist. 
 To the Editor:
 While the requirement that hospitals notify UnitedHealthcare of an admission within 24 hours is stringent, it is not a major point of contention. 
 Rather, it is UnitedHealthcare's plan to cut hospitals' reimbursement by 50 percent for notifications provided later than 24 hours that is so unreasonable. By contrast, an insurer in New York that waited an entire year to pay a hospital claim would incur a penalty of 12 percent interest.
 By any measure, a 50 percent penalty is egregiously disproportionate to the supposed infraction and cannot be viewed as anything short of confiscatory -- especially with UnitedHealthcare making billions in profits and most hospitals struggling just to break even.
 Kenneth E. Raske President, Greater New York Hospital Association New York, Feb. 1, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Of the dispute between UnitedHealthcare and Continuum Health Partners, you write that ''the insurer appears to be acting responsibly.''
 How is it responsible to reimburse hospitals less than health care actually costs? Hard bargaining by insurance companies doesn't bring real costs down -- it just pressures providers to make economic rather than medical decisions. And that is UnitedHealthcare's specialty -- forcing providers to spend their time and money justifying care rather than providing it. 
 During the one unfortunate year I spent as a client of Oxford (owned by UnitedHealthcare), it made some attempt to deny payment on almost every claim I made. Most of those denials were specious and Oxford ended up having to pay, but not until it had wasted money challenging the claim and forced my doctors to refile paperwork or further justify their medical decisions, none of which improves health care, and all of which adds to its cost.
 And it goes without saying that Oxford never intervened on behalf of more medical care, only on behalf of less.

HEADLINE: In a Down Market, Long Island Keeps Its Warehouses Busy

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
RONKONKOMA, N.Y. -- Landlords don't typically expect to set leasing records in a severe economic downturn, but the Long Island industrial real estate market is proving to be a welcome anomaly.
 With a 4.5 percent vacancy rate that is the lowest of any industrial market in the country, Long Island's 6,200 warehouses appear to be weathering the recession handily. Industrial space tends to have a reputation for stability; while unemployed people may not use office space, they still tend to consume. But the strength of Long Island's market has surprised even its longtime real estate watchers.
 One reason that leasing has been so successful is that landlords have reduced prices by about 12.3 percent. The average asking rent fell to $9.27 a square foot in the fourth quarter of 2009, from a high of $10.58 a square foot in the second quarter of 2008. 
 Rechler Equity Partners, a property developer based in Melville, N.Y., that has about six million square feet of commercial real estate, signed leases on more than one million square feet of space in 2009, a level not reached very often, even during the boom years from about 2003 to 2008.
 ''It's only the third time we've broken the one-million-square-feet mark,'' said Gregg Rechler, a partner with Rechler Equity, a 50-year-old family-run company. ''It's pretty significant, and it definitely exceeded our expectations when we started 2009.''
 One large deal was the Package All Corporation's lease of 98,000 square feet at 2005 Orville Drive in Ronkonkoma, one of the largest Long Island leasing deals in 2009. Mitchell D. Rechler, Gregg Rechler's cousin and a Rechler partner, said the company had been pricing warehouse space low enough to be attractive. Also, 45 percent of the leases signed by Rechler Equity were renewals, many initiated by tenants taking advantage of the market to renegotiate their leases.
 Still, what has buoyed landlords the most has been the relative vitality of the Long Island industrial market, a strength not mirrored by its ravaged office market.
 ''I remember my grandfather telling me that historically, in economic declines, industrial real estate was the leading indicator, before office,'' Mitchell Rechler said. ''And in the recession of the late '80s and early '90s, industrial was the first thing hit. That has not been the case this time around.''
 Some real estate experts say Long Island's market has characteristics that help it hold up in severe recessions. Unlike northern New Jersey, which is a national distribution center, Long Island serves mainly the island and New York City, said Aaron Jodka, a senior economist at Property and Portfolio Research, a unit of the CoStar Group, a real estate information company based in Bethesda, Md.
 The industrial market on Long Island, with about 170 million square feet of space, is about a third the size of the one in northern New Jersey. Companies on Long Island tend to be local service firms, regional distributors, and light manufacturing and assembly operations, often for industries like pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. Buildings tend to be closer to 50,000 square feet than the warehouses of more than 100,000 square feet seen in national distribution hubs.
 The New Jersey market ''is much weaker now, because it's tied to the national economy,'' Mr. Jodka said, ''so as retailers have slumped, as trade has slumped, northern New Jersey has taken a larger hit.''
 While the economies of Long Island and New York City have also suffered, they have not fared as badly as some other locales. And unlike markets like Atlanta and the Inland Empire in California, Long Island did not experience a rush of new warehouse development before the recession, primarily because of the shortage of developable land.
 ''A lot of the stuff that is built on Long Island is geared toward the local distributor, or it's built to suit, so as the space comes online, it's already preleased to a specific tenant,'' Mr. Jodka said. ''That generally helps to keep the market more stable.''
 Asking rents for industrial space on Long Island have been slipping slowly since the second quarter of 2008. By the fourth quarter of 2009, they had fallen to $9.27 a square foot, according to the CoStar Group. Nationally, the average rate for industrial space hovers around $6 a square foot.
 ''The market is certainly slumping as demand is waning,'' Mr. Jodka said of Long Island. ''There's pressure across the board, as there is nationally, but the decline hasn't been as strong as those markets that saw an abundance of new supply.''
 The number of building sales has also dropped precipitously, with only 23 Long Island warehouses changing hands in the first nine months of 2009, compared with 60 in the period a year earlier.
 Robert C. Godfrey, a senior vice president at the real estate company CB Richard Ellis, said: ''That part of the market has slowed more than the leasing part, because of the lack of financing. Financing deals over $5 million or $6 million has gotten very difficult.''
 Long Island will remain sleepy once the recession is over, Mr. Jodka said. 
 ''It's a slower, steadier market, less volatility, and that's excellent right now,'' he said. ''But once the national economy starts to rebound, it moves Long Island to sort of the back seat.''

HEADLINE: Al Qaeda Intent on Attack, Senators Told

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
America's top intelligence official told lawmakers on Tuesday that Al Qaeda and its affiliates had made it a high priority to attempt a large-scale attack on American soil within the next six months.
 The assessment by Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, was much starker than his view last year, when he emphasized the considerable progress in the campaign to debilitate Al Qaeda and said that the global economic meltdown, rather than the prospect of a major terrorist attack, was the ''primary near-term security concern of the United States.''
 At Tuesday's hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Mr. Blair to assess the possibility of an attempted attack in the United States in the next three to six months. 
 He replied, ''The priority is certain, I would say'' -- a response that was reaffirmed by the top officials of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.
 Citing a recent wave of terrorist plots, including the failed Dec. 25 attempt to blow up an airliner as it approached Detroit, Mr. Blair and other intelligence officials told a Senate panel that Al Qaeda had adjusted its tactics to more effectively strike American targets domestically and abroad. 
 ''The biggest threat is not so much that we face an attack like 9/11,'' said Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director. ''It is that Al Qaeda is adapting its methods in ways that oftentimes make it difficult to detect.'' 
 As the C.I.A. continues its drone attacks aimed at Qaeda operatives in Pakistan, the officials also said that the network's splinter groups in Yemen and Somalia were taking on more importance.
 But Mr. Blair began his annual threat testimony before Congress by saying that the threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and other computer networks was growing, as an increasingly sophisticated group of enemies had ''severely threatened'' the sometimes fragile systems undergirding the country's information infrastructure. 
 ''Malicious cyberactivity is occurring on an unprecedented scale with extraordinary sophistication,'' he told the committee.
 His emphasis on the threat points up the growing concerns among American intelligence officials about the potentially devastating results of a coordinated attack on the nation's technology apparatus, sometimes called a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor.''
 He said that the surge in cyberattacks, including the penetration of Google's servers from inside China, was a ''wake-up call'' for those who dismissed the threat of computer warfare. ''Sensitive information is stolen daily from both government and private-sector networks, undermining confidence in our information systems, and in the very information these systems were intended to convey,'' Mr. Blair said. 
 In another departure from last year's testimony, Mr. Blair appeared alongside other top intelligence officials, including the heads of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the Defense Intelligence Agency. Last year, the intelligence director sat alone before the committee, a partly symbolic gesture intended to demonstrate the authority of the director, whose office has been criticized for commanding little power over America's 16 intelligence agencies. 
 At times, the senators seemed more interested in debating one another than in hearing testimony from witnesses. Midway through the hearing, partisan bickering broke out about whether terrorist suspects ought to be tried in civilian courts and whether the man charged as the Dec. 25 bomber should have been given Miranda rights that could protect him against self-incrimination. 
 As senators traded barbs, the intelligence officials stared stonily ahead or shuffled their notes.
 The intelligence chiefs also raised warnings about nuclear proliferation, particularly focusing on Iran and North Korea.
 Mr. Blair said that Iran ''has the scientific, technical and industrial capacity to eventually produce nuclear weapons,'' and that the discovery of a secret enrichment plant near Qum heightened suspicions about Iran's intentions to build a nuclear bomb.
 Still, he said that Tehran was following a ''cost-benefit approach'' to its nuclear decision-making and that it remained unclear whether Iran's leadership would make a political calculation to begin producing weapons-grade uranium, allowing other nations to ''influence'' that decision through diplomatic steps.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Profit Rises Sharply On Strong Holiday Shipping

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
United Parcel Service said Tuesday that its income nearly tripled in the fourth-quarter, helped by more Internet shopping and increased use of premium services like next day shipping. 
 The company said it earned $757 million, or 75 cents a share, up from $254 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 2.5 percent, to $12.38 billion, from $12.70 billion.
 U.P.S., based in Atlanta, attributed the strong performance to a good holiday shipping season and solid international business. Significant growth in online retail sales on sites like Amazon.com and BestBuy.com helped domestic results. 
 Also, in November, Manheim, a vehicle auction company, hired U.P.S. to oversee its entire supply chain for moving millions of used vehicles each year to the wholesale market.
 U.P.S. said its capital spending this year would total about $1.8 billion, below the historical range, although up from $1.6 billion in 2009. The company is also cutting 1,800 management and administrative jobs, less than 1 percent of its global work force, as it repositions itself for a gradual economic recovery with improved technology and fewer employees. The job cuts are meant to streamline the company's domestic small-package segment, which represents about 60 percent of its annual revenue.
 ''U.P.S. has emerged from a very difficult year leaner, more focused and better positioned to take advantage of improving economic trends,'' the chief executive, D. Scott Davis, told analysts during a conference call.
 The company also issued a forecast for 2010 earnings that was consistent with Wall Street expectations.
 Stock in U.P.S. rose 23 cents, to $58.62.
 In its fourth quarter, U.P.S.'s package volume rose 1.4 percent. During the holiday shipping season, global volume exceeded 22 million packages on eight days. It twice exceeded 24 million packages.
 International operating profit jumped 27.6 percent. All regions experienced export volume growth, led by Asia and the United States.

HEADLINE: Recalling Howard Zinn, the Man and the Historian

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's Jan. 30 column about Howard Zinn, ''A Radical Treasure,'' is a wonderful tribute to a great man. We never met Mr. Zinn except through his books and films. Yet his death left us with a profound sadness. 
 There aren't many people who speak truth to power and do so with as much grace, intelligence and compassion as Mr. Zinn. His ''People's History of the United States'' should be read by all Americans. It's our failure to understand and take responsibility for our arrogance that has led us into so many military mistakes and economic calamities. Thank you, Bob Herbert, for reminding us of what this world lost when this great man died.
 Larry Barkan Carol Barkan Tempe, Ariz., Jan. 30, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert suggests that the fact that the late historian Howard Zinn was viewed as a dangerous radical by some people is a sad commentary on American intellectual life. 
 I could not disagree more. I never met Mr. Zinn, but I have seen, as a history professor as well as in my research on French anti-Americanism, the awful effect that ''A People's History of the United States'' has had on several generations of students. In Mr. Zinn's effort to tell ''the other side of the story,'' he dramatically distorted events on both sides and reduced the complexities of international politics to a struggle between good and evil.
 An excellent raconteur, he was, however, determined to write history as a story of American malfeasance. The result, among students who embraced his ideas, is a sort of facile cynicism posing as sophistication, and, perhaps worse, the tragically fatalistic idea that American history is little more than a conspiracy against humanity.
 Seth Armus Long Beach, N.Y., Jan. 30, 2010
 The writer is an associate professor of history at St. Joseph's College and the author of ''French Anti-Americanism, 1930-1948: Critical Moments in a Complex History.''
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's column about Howard Zinn is incisive. As a colleague of his at Boston University for 23 years, and another two decades as a friend and neighbor, I know firsthand what a remarkably talented and humane individual he was.
 Whether he was working as a historian/political scientist or playwright, his breadth of knowledge and profound concern about so many issues -- from civil rights and tenants' rights to the global cold war -- were extraordinary. 
 Above all, he cared about these matters personally no less than intellectually. He was always among the first in America to put himself on the line, whether at civil rights sit-ins or trips to Vietnam, or in trenchant essays about the nation's unresolved problems.
 Above all, he was an incredibly kind and caring person, who never spoke ill of people in politics or higher education no matter how much he deplored their views or actions. For those who knew him or read his many books about history ''from the bottom up,'' as historians like to say, a treasure is gone from our lives, but not its legacy.
 Arnold A. Offner Newton, Mass., Jan. 30, 2010
 The writer is a professor of history at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa.

HEADLINE: At a Neglected Movie Palace, Cobwebs Are Given Notice

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER and NATASHA LENNARD

 BODY:
The building bears little resemblance to the extravagantly sumptuous ''wonder theater'' that wowed audiences in 1929. 
 The rusting, dirt-caked marquee that hangs outside the Loew's Kings Theater over a bustling commercial stretch of Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn last promoted a film in 1977. Years of neglect have left the interior rotted by time, stripped by thieves and desecrated by vandals and pigeons. 
 New York City, which seized the building decades ago in lieu of back taxes, has long teased the neighborhood with proposals to restore the lost luster of a local landmark. But this time, the city says, it is for real. 
 A developer has signed an agreement, made a down payment on a $70 million renovation and plans to turn the building back into a functioning entertainment venue, this time presenting live performances, city officials said Tuesday.
 ''We're on our way to making that dream come true,'' said Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, who is to formally announce the restoration in his State of the Borough address Wednesday. 
 After a four-year process -- and many false starts -- the city has selected a company based in Houston, ACE Theatrical Group, to renovate and operate the theater. It would be, once again, the biggest indoor theater in Brooklyn, presenting 250 concerts, theatrical performances and community events annually, officials said.
 ''We feel like we have a deal we can deliver on,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. ''We are confident this project is going to move forward.''
 ACE, which has worked on similar restoration projects throughout the country, including the Boston Opera House, will soon begin a review and design process that is expected to take a couple of years. Preliminary plans call for the space to open as soon as 2014, Mr. Pinsky said. The city has committed $50 million to the project, with another $15 million coming in the form of tax credits and $5 million from the developer, which would also be responsible for any extra spending, said Mr. Pinsky.
 On a stretch of Flatbush Avenue near Beverly Road -- which the theater shares with discount furniture and clothing stores, a vacant lot and a boarded-up storefront -- news of the renovation was greeted with enthusiasm by residents who had never been inside it. ''It would be a great thing if they made it a venue again,'' said Ulana Lewin, 30, who works at Relly Clothes across the street. ''It would be good for business.''
 The Kings, as it was known to generations of Brooklynites, opened on Sept. 7, 1929, with a screening of ''Evangeline'' and a special appearance by its star, Dolores del Rio. One of five so-called wonder theaters built by Loew's -- sister theaters in Jersey City and elsewhere have been converted into churches or restored into entertainment spaces -- the 68,000-square-foot Kings featured vaudeville acts and a pipe organ before moving exclusively to movies. 
 Over the years, as economics began to favor multiplexes, fewer and fewer of the 3,200 seats were filled. On Aug. 30, 1977, the Kings screened its final feature: ''Islands in the Stream,'' starring George C. Scott. This time, the star did not stop by for a special appearance. Two years later, the theater, owing back taxes, was seized by the city and began to quietly disintegrate.
 ''If it was located in Midtown Manhattan it never would have been able to fall into the state of disrepair that it was allowed to fall into,'' Mr. Pinsky said.
 For the last 10 years, John Friedman, the property manager, has watched over the building he frequented as a younger man. On Tuesday he led a brief tour. The beams of his heavy black flashlight struggled to cut through the gloom, barely reaching the vaulted ceilings in the cavernous orchestra dome. 
 Some original touches survive, like dusty crystal chandeliers still hanging in the lobby. The stage has aged less gracefully; it is flanked by torn burgundy curtains covered in droppings from birds that roosted inside until a broken skylight was sealed. 
 David Anderson, the president of ACE Theatrical, said it would take a while to evaluate the extent of the damage, but he emphasized the company's commitment to the original design. ''We'll be able to recreate what it looks like when it was first put into use,'' he said. ''We'll be able to very accurately recreate what is no longer there and restore what is there.''
 ''It's an absolutely wonderful space,'' said Richard J. Sklenar, executive director of the Theater Historical Society of America. ''There's nothing there that can't be taken care of; $70 million sounds like it can do the job.''

HEADLINE: China's Defiance on Human Rights Stirs Fears for Missing Dissident

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Zhang Jing and Jonathan Ansfield contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
A year ago this week, Chinese security agents made a midnight visit to the home of Gao Zhisheng, one of China's most high-profile human rights lawyers, and led him away. They told his family he was wanted for a brief chat.
 In the months that followed, his whereabouts have become a mystery and a growing source of concern for relatives, colleagues and human rights advocates, who fear that he has been badly tortured or worse. 
 His case is highly unusual, even by the standards of China's opaque justice system. After a previous detention in 2006, Mr. Gao was allowed to return home after publicly confessing to a number of transgressions. Once out of custody, however, Mr. Gao recanted his confession and described abuse he said he had suffered. He also said his torturers told him he would be killed if he spoke publicly about the matter. 
 Diplomatic entreaties to the Chinese government have been brushed aside. Foreign reporters who ask about his plight have been treated to glib retorts. Ma Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, compounded the mystery two weeks ago by saying that Mr. Gao ''is where he should be.'' When prodded again at a regular press briefing last Tuesday, he offered a smile and said: ''Honestly speaking, I don't know where he is. China has 1.3 billion people and I can't know all of their whereabouts.''
 Legal experts say the disappearance of Mr. Gao, whose case has been championed by American lawmakers, several European leaders and the United Nations, represents a disturbing milestone. Even in the most politicized cases, the Chinese authorities generally claim to be complying with their own criminal procedure laws. Mr. Gao has vanished with no official accounting or legal explanation. 
 Emboldened by China's newfound economic prowess but insecure about its standing at home, the Chinese Communist Party has been tightening Internet censorship, cracking down on legal rights defenders and brushing aside foreign leaders who seek to influence the outcome of individual cases. 
 In December, the authorities executed Akmal Shaikh, a British citizen, on drug trafficking charges despite Prime Minister Gordon Brown's personal plea to President Hu Jintao that Mr. Shaikh was mentally ill. 
 During President Obama's state visit to China in November, the plight of a pro-democracy advocate, Liu Xiaobo, was reportedly at the top of his list of concerns. A few weeks later, on Dec. 25, Mr. Liu was given an unexpectedly harsh 11-year sentence for publishing an online petition that sought expanded liberties. 
 John Kamm, a veteran American human rights campaigner, said that during three decades working in China he had rarely seen such a hard line toward dissidents -- and unbridled defiance against pressure from abroad. ''China right now doesn't feel like it owes anyone anything on human rights,'' said Mr. Kamm, the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, which seeks clemency for political prisoners through quiet diplomacy. ''I've never seen a downward spiral like this.''
 In the 31 years since the People's Republic of China and the United States established diplomatic relations, Chinese officials have often resisted American intervention on human rights, calling the issue a domestic matter. But there has generally been some give and take, largely behind the scenes, especially in the years after the violent suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square, when China was eager to shed its pariah status abroad. 
 That leverage began dissipating in 2001 after China was admitted to the World Trade Organization, and Congress surrendered the right to review China's human rights record before granting it favorable trade status. 
 There is little space in Chinese society for unyielding dissidents like Mr. Gao. But until recently, the authorities often allowed them to stay at home under close surveillance. If they crossed certain unwritten lines, they might be prosecuted, often for the crime of inciting subversion or leaking state secrets. Even if stymied in their defense, lawyers can expect a modicum of information about their clients. Family jailhouse visits are not uncommon.
 But Mr. Gao's case has defied these norms. 
 In September, a security agent who took Mr. Gao into custody told one of his brothers that he had simply disappeared during a walk. The brother, Gao Zhiyi, said he suspected the worst. ''If he were alive, they would have allowed me to visit him,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in Shaanxi Province. ''Either that or he's in such bad shape, it would be too horrible for anyone to see him.''
 Rights advocates say Mr. Gao's predicament can be partly traced to his persistent and caustic criticism of the ruling Communist Party. A self-educated lawyer, Mr. Gao, 46, was named one of China's top 10 lawyers by the Ministry of Justice in 2001 for his work defending victims of medical malpractice and farmers whose land had been seized for redevelopment. 
 But Mr. Gao quickly ran afoul of the authorities when he began representing members of unofficial Christian churches and adherents of Falun Gong, the banned spiritual movement. In 2005, the Beijing judicial bureau closed his firm and suspended the licenses of its 20 lawyers. Mr. Gao countered by publicly renouncing his Communist Party membership and writing a series of open letters to senior leaders that demanded an end to the persecution of Falun Gong believers. 
 A week later, Mr. Gao was arrested. In a letter published just before his latest disappearance, he documented what he said happened to him during his 54 days in custody. He was shocked and beaten almost continuously, he wrote, or forced to sit motionless, enveloped by blinding lights. By the end, he said, ''the skin all over my body had turned black.'' He was released only after he confessed to various crimes; he retracted his confession as soon as he was let go.
 A month before he vanished last February, Mr. Gao's wife and children slipped away from their minders and, with the help of Christian activists, left China. Ten days later, they were granted asylum in the United States. 
 Renee Xia, the international director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said the family's escape, coupled with the revelations of Mr. Gao's torture, probably infuriated those charged with reining in his activities. 
 Given the increasingly strained relations between China and the United States, it is unclear whether Mr. Gao's supporters abroad can have any impact on his fate. But some, like Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that Chinese leaders were still sensitive to international criticism and that a spike in global protests over Mr. Gao's mistreatment would not go unnoticed. 
 ''Beijing doesn't care about releasing a prisoner or two,'' he said. ''It's not going to bring about the collapse of the Communist Party but if they don't have to do it, they won't.''

HEADLINE: In Response to Iran's Nuclear Program, German Firms Are Slowly Pulling Out

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
German companies, long Iran's biggest trading partners in Europe, are finding it increasingly difficult to do business there as the United States, Israel and others campaign for tougher United Nations sanctions in response to the country's nuclear program. 
 Yet even those companies that said they were pulling out -- most notably Siemens last week -- will probably take years to wind down operations and wrap up outstanding contracts. Others are simply lowering their profile or finding third countries to do business through, fearing they will lose a lucrative market forever if they abandon it now.
 ''What our members want is a level playing field,'' said Ulrich Ackermann, who is responsible for Iran and other countries in the region at the German Engineering Federation, a lobbying group for the sector. ''If our German companies pull out, will other, non-German companies replace us?'' 
 Although no precise numbers are available -- several big German companies declined to discuss their business activities in Iran -- interviews with other companies, trade associations and export guarantee agencies suggest a significant reduction of direct trade between Germany and Iran. 
 One of the biggest changes is that Iranian companies seeking to import from German companies can no longer receive credit guarantees for seven to 10 years, which used to be normal for big infrastructure projects. 
 Now, ''they have to pay within 360 days,'' said Ruth Bartonek, a spokeswoman for Euler Hermes, the agency that manages the German government's export credit guarantees. 
 The change was made over the last two years as a result of political pressure from the United States. 
 As a result, credit guarantees for Iran in 2008 -- the latest figure available -- amounted to 133 million euros ($186 million), compared with 503 million euros in 2007. In 2005, they were 1.4 billion euros.
 Germany remains Iran's biggest trading partner in Europe, although the market is small. Dozens of German companies have offices in Iran; Herrenknecht, a German company considered the market leader in tunnel-boring machines, lists three.
 German exports to Iran in 2008 amounted to nearly 4 billion euros, or less than 1 percent of total German exports. That was down slightly from 4.4 billion euros in 2005.
 As a bloc, the 27-country European Union exported goods worth 14.1 billion euros to Iran in 2008 -- machinery, transport equipment, manufactured goods and chemicals. Imports totaled 11.3 billion euros in 2008, mostly energy and energy-related products.
 China is Iran's largest trading partner, responsible for about 14 percent of its imports and exports in 2008.
 Beijing has been resisting renewed calls for expanded sanctions on Iran, but pressure on German companies has become much stronger in recent months. 
 Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly called for more sanctions, saying last week that ''time is running out.'' She even suggested that if the United Nations Security Council failed to endorse a new package of sanctions, then European countries and other like-minded governments should take action.
 Vocal pro-Israeli and Iranian exile lobbies are active, too, asking questions at the annual general meetings of those German companies doing business with Iran.
 Peter Loscher, the chief executive of Siemens, announced last week that the engineering company would pull out of Iran once it had cleared its order sheet and fulfilled its contracts over the next couple of years, mostly infrastructure projects. The announcement coincided with the state visit to Berlin of the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, who warned that Israel would be a target if Iran obtained nuclear weapons.
 Siemens played down its involvement in Iran. ''Our turnover there was insignificant,'' said Wolfram Trost, a spokesman for Siemens. ''It was only 0.7 percent, or about 500 million euros, of our total sales.''
 Still, Siemens had been under investigation by German customs officers. Last year, they found turbo compressors destined for Iran through a Siemens branch in Sweden. The investigators said the compressors could have had a dual-use role, including, for example, in Iran's missile program. Siemens said all its exports to Iran were ''for civilian purposes'' and declined to elaborate on any specifics. 
 Ferrostaal, a company that makes petrochemicals and power plants, said in a statement that it received no new orders from Iran in 2009 and that all its past engineering and construction contracts ''are finished already.'' 
 The company had sales to Iran of 1.6 billion euros in 2008 and expects the same for 2009. The International Petroleum Investment Company of Abu Dhabi owns 70 percent of Ferrostaal and MAN of Germany the rest. 
 BASF, the giant German chemicals company, which has operations in Iran, declined to comment. 
 ThyssenKrupp, a German steel company that has had decades of experience in Iran, said it abided by all export and sanctions regulations. Alexander Wilke, its spokesman, said the company's business in Iran was less than 0.5 percent of global sales, which last year totaled 40.5 billion euros.
 Because of the sanctions regime, the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control is scrutinizing more closely every request by a German company to export to Iran. Holger Beutel, a spokesman for the office, said that the agency was particularly on the lookout for dual-use exports, which can be used both for civilian and military purposes. Under United Nations sanctions, no dual-use equipment for nuclear or related technology is allowed.
 In 2009, the office granted 7,210 permits for dual-use purposes, of which 48 were for Iran. It refused nine dual-use export licenses for Iran. In 2008, it granted 7,845 permissions for dual-use purposes, of which 39 were for exports to Iran. Fourteen export licenses for Iran were refused.
 Despite such scrutiny, the office acknowledged that German companies could circumvent these restrictions by using third countries.
 The office ''is conscious of the fact that business activities can be done through third countries,'' Mr. Beutel said.
 A German business executive in Iran who represents several German companies confirmed this. ''Dubai is Iran's biggest trading partner, yet Dubai produces nothing,'' he said, requesting anonymity because, he said, he would be fired if he gave his name. ''The pressure from Berlin is increasing. German companies are becoming nervous. So they go to Dubai. And the Americans do business with Iran via Dubai. As for the Israelis, they can buy perfectly good Iranian washing machines via Romania.''
 Mr. Ackermann, from the German Engineering Federation, would not comment on the use of third countries. But he said that even if some German companies found ways to get around the sanctions, it cost them time, money and personnel. 
 ''I don't want to discuss politics,'' he said. ''But one thing is sure: Once you lose your market niche, it is very difficult to regain it.''

HEADLINE: News Corp. Earnings, Bolstered by 'Avatar,' Surpass Analysts' Estimates

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
Buoyed by the success of ''Avatar,'' the science fiction blockbuster that has become the highest-grossing movie to date, the News Corporation reported a quarterly profit on Tuesday that surpassed the expectations of Wall Street analysts.
 But the financial success was reduced by the effect of a recent $500 million payment to settle three lawsuits against one of its lesser-known units, News America Marketing, which sells in-store advertising in supermarkets and publishes coupon inserts. 
 ''Avatar,'' made by James Cameron and released by News Corporation's 20th Century Fox film studio, has generated nearly $600 million at the North American box office, and more than $2 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing movie to date in dollars not adjusted for inflation. It surpassed ''Titanic,'' another film from Mr. Cameron, that had topped the list of moneymakers.
 Because of the success of ''Avatar,'' several Wall Street analysts raised their earnings estimates for the News Corporation in recent days. 
 The News Corporation reported revenue of $8.68 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31, up 10 percent from the quarter a year earlier.
 Excluding the effect of the $500 million settlement, the company reported operating income of $1.2 billion, up from $839 million a year earlier.
 The second-quarter net income was $254 million, or 10 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $6.4 billion, or $2.45 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 In a conference call with analysts, Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation's chairman, described the company's performance as ''extraordinary'' given that ''we've endured the most severe recession since the Great Depression.''
 Adjusted second-quarter earnings were 25 cents a share. On average, Wall Street analysts had expected the company to earn 20 cents a share in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.
 In addition to its Hollywood studio, the News Corporation owns a wide range of media assets, including the Fox broadcast television network, Fox News Channel, satellite services in Britain and Asia, and several newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post.
 All four of the company's biggest businesses -- broadcast TV, cable TV, newspapers and movies -- reported increases in both revenue and operating income.
 At the company's newspaper unit, which is central to the company and close to Mr. Murdoch's heart, operating income increased from $200 million to $259 million. Revenue increased from $1.5 billion to $1.65 billion. 
 The company attributed the profit gain to ''increased advertising revenues at The Wall Street Journal and lower operating expenses throughout the newspaper businesses from prior year restructuring efforts,'' according to a company statement.
 The cable network division contributed the most to the company's overall profit, largely because of the success of Fox News, which has emerged as the growth engine of the News Corporation. Operating income from the unit increased to $604 million, from $448 million. 
 In film, the News Corporation reported an increase in operating income to $324 million, from $112 million. 
 While ''Avatar'' certainly helped, the film will probably be a larger contributor in the third quarter. The film was released on Dec. 18, so it was only in theaters for 13 days during the quarter. 
 ''In the quarter we booked much of the film's costs but only a small portion of its receipts,'' Mr. Murdoch said.
 On the call, Mr. Murdoch defended the value of content, especially journalism, in the face of the Internet and new technologies, which have upended traditional media models.
 He said that new devices, like Apple's recently introduced iPad, and smartphones would be ''empty vessels without any great content.''
 ''Content is not just king,'' Mr. Murdoch said, ''it is the emperor of all things electronic.''

HEADLINE: Stumping for Jobs Plan, Obama Pushes Health Bill

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H. 

 BODY:
President Obama hit the road again Tuesday to promote the new job-creation program he described as his No. 1 priority, but he refused to abandon his embattled health care legislation, vowing to ''punch it through'' resistance in Congress.
 In a feisty and at times biting performance, Mr. Obama said the rising national debt ''keeps me awake at night,'' but put much of the blame on his predecessor and on unrestrained health care spending that he wants to rein in. 
 The New Hampshire visit was the latest stop on Mr. Obama's tour of the country that is intended to recalibrate his presidency after the special election in Massachusetts cost his party unfettered control of the Senate. 
 His town-hall-style meeting at a local high school here was the fifth time he had taken questions from an audience or over the Internet in 12 days, and he rejected the notion that the Massachusetts election doomed the health care overhaul. 
 ''Suddenly everybody says, 'Oh no, it's over,' '' Mr. Obama said in mocking tones. ''Well, no, it's not over. We just have to make sure that we move methodically and that the American people understand what's in the bill.''
 The strong emphasis on health care came a week after he did not mention it until deep into his State of the Union address, and he seemed intent on erasing any doubts about his commitment. 
 ''We had to go into overtime,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But we are now in the red zone. That's exactly right. We're in the red zone. We've got to punch it through.''
 As he worked to salvage his program, Mr. Obama also opened the door to disassembling the climate change legislation that passed the House last year and pushing forward with parts that could still pass the Senate. ''We may be able to separate these things out,'' he said, ''and it's conceivable that that's where the Senate ends up.'' 
 The president came here to promote a proposal to use $30 billion of repaid bailout loans to help community banks increase lending to small businesses, part of a broader effort to stimulate job creation with the unemployment rate stuck at 10 percent.
 The Independent Community Bankers of America praised the plan, saying in a statement that ''every dollar of capital that goes into a community bank can potentially be leveraged 8 to 10 times into loans to small businesses.'' But the Credit Union National Association declared itself ''outraged and baffled,'' asserting that the government could do more without cost to taxpayers by allowing more business lending by credit unions.
 Critics said the plan was misguided because community banks had sufficient capital but were not lending as much as larger banks because they had trouble finding worthy borrowers. And some Republicans criticized the plan because under current law repaid bailout money is supposed to pay down public debt.
 ''It's not for a piggy bank because you're concerned about lending to small businesses and you want to get a political event when you go out and make a speech in Nashua,'' Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, told the White House budget director at a testy hearing in Washington. ''That's not what this money's for. This money is to reduce the debt of our children.''
 The administration wants Congress to change the law and argued that most if not all of the money would eventually be repaid, meaning it would add relatively little to the deficit over time. But administration officials ran into other criticism on Capitol Hill a day after Mr. Obama released a budget plan projecting trillions of dollars of additional debt through his presidency.
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said that increasing Medicare, payroll and personal income taxes on those making over $250,000 would hurt small businesses. ''There is no way they're going to move forward to job creation,'' she said. ''Who would take the risk?''
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner replied that reversing Bush-era tax cuts for wealthy Americans would affect only a fraction of small businesses. ''You could say 2 to 3 percent is a lot of small businesses,'' he said, ''but it's only 2 to 3 percent.''

HEADLINE: Obama Trip Cancellation Piques European Officials

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Maia de la Baume contributed reporting from Paris, and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
President Obama's decision to skip a United States-European Union summit meeting scheduled for Madrid in May has predictably upset European officials, who suggested Tuesday that the summit meeting itself would now be postponed, possibly to the autumn.
 In addition to the palpable sense of insult among European officials, there is a growing concern that Europe is being taken for granted and losing importance in American eyes compared with the rise of a newly truculent China. 
 European Union officials found out about the decision through the news media late on Monday, senior European officials said Tuesday morning. The decision was first reported on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal.
 The Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who is scheduled to arrive in Washington this week on a visit, was described as angry and embarrassed, and European officials said there was a set of high-level diplomatic exchanges overnight.
 The White House explained the decision as a matter of scheduling, insisting that the May visit to Europe was never on the president's agenda, so it could not be said to have been canceled.
 European officials said that two senior American officials -- the under secretary of state for political affairs, William J. Burns, and the assistant secretary of state for European affairs, Philip H. Gordon -- had attended a preparatory meeting for the summit meeting two weeks ago in Madrid, and that there was no hint then that Mr. Obama would decide not to attend.
 But a senior American official said that Mr. Gordon and Mr. Burns emphasized to Spanish officials, when the meeting was raised, that they ''were not in a position to commit to one.'' In fact, the official said, the Obama administration has been ''pursuing and getting a better relationship with Spain and the new E.U.,'' with Mr. Zapatero visiting Washington twice.
 Speaking for Mr. Obama, Mr. Gordon told journalists in Washington on Monday that the trip to Spain ''was never on his agenda.'' The president had ''traveled more to Europe in his first year probably than any president has ever done in the past, and he looks forward to continuing his engagement bilaterally with European allies and directly with the European Union.''
 Mike Hammer, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said that while there were no plans for the trip to Madrid, ''the president is committed to a strong U.S.-E.U. partnership, and with Europe in general,'' on topics like Afghanistan, counterterrorism, the global economy and climate change.
 Indications that Mr. Obama might forego the conference emerged in Davos, Switzerland, from foreign ministers who attended the global economic forum there. One senior European official suggested that after the loss of a Senate seat to the Republicans in Massachusetts, Mr. Obama would be doing less traveling to supposedly glamorous spots like Europe that would only feed Republican criticism. 
 American officials said that Mr. Obama felt that the previous major American-European summit meeting, last June in Prague, was a waste of time, and European Union officials said that the president even skipped a leaders' lunch at the smaller European Union-United States meeting in Washington last November, sending Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. instead, something they said that President George W. Bush would never have done.
 Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research center, said that the Obama decision ''is a useful wake-up call for the E.U.'' He said the European Union must realize ''that no one will court them or have summits with them because Europe is a nice idea. 
 ''They need to deliver.''
 Mr. Obama sees Europe as an important ally, but ''Obama clearly has no emotional identification with Europe,'' Mr. Grant said. ''He has a cool, analytical view of allies and partners, but when the Europeans can't provide much to help America solve global security problems, he doesn't want to spend too much time on it.''
 The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, tried to play down the issue, saying he understood that, after ''repeated trips to Europe and several meetings with European leaders,'' Mr. Obama ''now needs to cut down a bit on his foreign traveling.'' He added that the group would ''work with the United States to find a mutually agreeable date for the summit.''
 Europe and NATO have provided troops for Afghanistan, but not many more since Mr. Obama took office, particularly measured against the new American buildup. Europe is divided on Russia and the Middle East, and has been very helpful on Iran, but mostly bilaterally. 
 ''It's unusual, and Europeans will be offended,'' said Nicole Bacharan, a professor of political science at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques. ''But for Obama, there is no urgency about the relationship with Europe. Europe works fine and he needs to refocus on urgent matters.''
 Relations with China have taken on new importance with the economic crisis, a confrontation over climate change and arms sales to Taiwan. Mr. Obama is also trying to push China to support harsher sanctions on Iran in the United Nations Security Council, which Beijing has been reluctant to do. 
 With the absence of Mr. Obama, the summit meeting is likely to be canceled. Mr. Obama is scheduled to come to Portugal in November for a NATO summit meeting, so it is possible that the European Union meeting will be rescheduled to coincide with that. It might also be rescheduled if there is a new nuclear arms-control treaty for Mr. Obama to sign with Russia.
 The State Department spokesman, P. J. Crowley, said in Washington on Monday that the transition to a new leadership of the European Union after the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty might have been a factor. ''Because of the changes involving the establishment of a E.U. council president and a European Commission president on top of the rotating E.U. presidency, I think it's taking some time to work through exactly how various high-level meetings will happen. But we look forward to ongoing dialogue.''

HEADLINE: China Warns U.S. Leaders Not to Meet the Dalai Lama

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Nashua, N.H.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
A senior Chinese official strongly warned President Obama on Tuesday against meeting with the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of the Tibetans, saying it would damage relations between China and the United States. 
 The official, Zhu Weiqun, said any country would suffer consequences if its leaders met with the Dalai Lama, whom China considers to be a dangerous separatist. Mr. Zhu did not elaborate on what actions China could take. 
 But a White House spokesman said the president's plans were unchanged. ''The president told China's leaders during his trip last year that he would meet with the Dalai Lama, and he intends to do so,'' said the spokesman, Bill Burton, speaking aboard Air Force One as it flew Mr. Obama to New Hampshire for an event. 
 ''To be clear,'' he added, ''the U.S. considers Tibet to be a part of China. We have human rights concerns about the treatment of Tibetans. We urge the government of China to protect the unique cultural and religious traditions of Tibet.''
 Last autumn, when the Dalai Lama visited the United States, Mr. Obama declined to meet with him to avoid angering China before Mr. Obama's trip to Beijing, in November. 
 Both Mr. Obama and the Dalai Lama are Nobel Peace Prize laureates. 
 Mr. Zhu, who is the executive vice director of the United Front Work Department, the arm of the Chinese Communist Party that oversees ethnic policy, made his remarks at a morning news conference, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. The purpose of the conference was to give details on recent negotiations between the Chinese government and envoys of the Dalai Lama, in which China rejected demands for greater Tibetan autonomy. 
 Any move by American leaders to meet the Dalai Lama will ''harm others but bring no profit to itself, either,'' Mr. Zhu said.
 Despite Mr. Obama's earlier overtures to Beijing, tensions between the United States and China have been on the rise. 
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton recently chastised China in a speech she gave in which she denounced Internet censorship. Last Friday, the United States announced sales of $6.4 billion of arms to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China says is a rebel province. In response, China said it would break off military-to-military ties with the United States and impose sanctions against the American companies that make the arms. 
 China usually criticizes any prominent figure who meets with the Dalai Lama. 
 In 2007, despite furious objections from China, President George W. Bush met privately with the Dalai Lama in Washington and was present at a ceremony at which Congress awarded the exiled Tibetan leader its highest civilian honor. China called the event a farce.
 A decade earlier, President Bill Clinton informally greeted the Dalai Lama at the White House and said he would urge China to open talks with him, but the two leaders did not meet formally. 
 In 2008 China protested a meeting between the Dalai Lama and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. It hinted that it would impose economic sanctions against France but never did. 
 China considers sovereignty issues like the status of Tibet and Taiwan to be what officials call the nation's ''core interests.'' Few things anger the Chinese government more than the perceived intervention of foreign countries in these matters. Tibet, always a thorny foreign policy issue for the Communist Party, became even more so after an uprising exploded across Tibetan regions of western China in March 2008. 
 The Dalai Lama, 74, lives in India and says he wants only ''genuine autonomy'' for Tibet, not independence. 
 The latest meeting between his envoys and Chinese officials ended over the weekend. It was the ninth round of talks since 2002, and Chinese officials restated their rejection of the Dalai Lama's call for greater autonomy for the Tibetans. 
 Mr. Zhu said Tuesday that the Dalai Lama was not a legal representative of the six million Tibetans in China and that China would discuss with the envoys only the status of the Dalai Lama, not the future of Tibet.

HEADLINE: Race Set for Obama's Old Senate Seat

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting from Chicago and Jeff Zeleny from Washington.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Representative Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican, and Alexi Giannoulias, the Illinois treasurer and a Democrat, won primary elections for the United States Senate here on Tuesday, setting up the pair for a contest in the fall over the seat once held by President Obama. 
 Though Illinois has been reliably Democratic in recent years, Republicans hope to see inroads this year, and Mr. Kirk, a five-term congressman with centrist-leaning views, wasted no time in making that clear. 
 ''The people of Illinois have seen the arrogance of a one-party state,'' Mr. Kirk said in a victory speech. ''We know that one political party cannot hold all the answers, and that one political party should not hold all the power.''
 Mr. Giannoulias, who fought off a stronger than expected primary challenge from David Hoffman, a former city inspector general who had never sought office, tried to portray Mr. Kirk as so entwined with the Washington establishment that he was out of touch with residents here. ''But come November, Congressman,'' Mr. Giannoulias said to supporters, ''your days as a Washington insider are over.''
 With 98 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Giannoulias received 39 percent of the vote; Mr. Hoffman, 34 percent; the rest going to others. 
 Democrats are eager to keep the seat not just to shore up their majority in the Senate, but also for the symbolism it carries. Roland W. Burris, a Democrat who was appointed to fill the seat after Mr. Obama became president, never overcame the controversy that surrounded his appointment and chose not to run.
 The results of the election were carefully watched at the White House, where the president was alerted to the news by his advisers late Tuesday evening. Mr. Obama has pledged to party officials to do what he could to help Mr. Giannoulias keep the seat in Democratic hands, but aides said the president would invest his time and efforts in races across the country and not necessarily devote more attention to his former seat, simply for the sake of nostalgia.
 The statewide primary, which appeared to have drawn low turnout (some experts blamed snow flurries, others ambivalence), was the nation's first in the 2010 elections. The timing, which drew added attention to the state's races from those searching for potential trends, was the result of Democrats here having pushed for an earlier primary in 2008, when they wished to have an early say in Mr. Obama's presidential chances. 
 Illinois voters do not register by party, but the state has leaned overwhelmingly Democratic in recent years; the party holds every statewide elected post and a majority in both chambers of the state legislature. Still, Republicans this year said they hoped to seize on the dismal state economy, the anti-establishment mood they saw last month in the special election for the Massachusetts Senate seat once held by Edward M. Kennedy, and the lingering, unavoidable shadow of Rod R. Blagojevich, the indicted former governor. 
 People here on Tuesday also voted for party nominees for governor, a job that has not been up for election since Mr. Blagojevich, whom prosecutors accused of trying to sell Mr. Obama's Senate seat to the highest bidder, was ousted a year ago. But as of midnight (central time), the Republican and Democratic contests for governor were extremely tight, conclusions remained uncertain, and some political experts began raising the specter of a recount - maybe even a couple of them. For the Democrats, Patrick J. Quinn, who was elevated to governor from lieutenant governor a year ago to replace Mr. Blagojevich, claimed victory over Dan Hynes, the state comptroller. 
 Just after midnight, Mr. Hynes addressed a room full of supporters to say that all the votes needed to be counted, however long it takes. ''That is what America's all about,'' he told the cheering crowd.
 Minutes later, Mr. Quinn emerged and told the crowd waiting for him that the primary was over. ''The time for fighting is over,'' he said, adding quickly, ''We have won this election.''
 In the final weeks of the campaign between Mr. Quinn and Mr, Hynes, the tone turned ugly. Racial politics crept in, with both candidates, who are white, trying to appeal to black voters. Governor Quinn criticized Mr. Hynes for his office's handling of a situation at a historically African American cemetery, Burr Oak, where bodies were found buried on top of one another. Mr. Quinn contended that Mr. Hynes, whose office regulates the finances of cemeteries, could have taken action to stop the circumstances. 
 Mr. Hynes, meanwhile, began airing television commercials featuring old images of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, criticizing Mr. Quinn. (Some decried the commercial, particularly given that Mr. Hynes's father, Thomas C. Hynes, a former Democratic county assessor had once run as a third party candidate for mayor against Mr. Washington, who died in office in 1987.) 
 On the he Republican side, Andy McKenna, former chairman of the state Republican party, and two state senators, Kirk Dillard and Bill Brady, were nearly even late into the evening. With 98 percent of precincts counted, Mr. Brady had 21 percent; Mr. Dillard, 20; Mr. McKenna, 19.
 Republican leaders here - buoyed by the victory last month of Scott Brown, a Republican, in Massachusetts' special election - said they believe they have a strong chance to win the governor's mansion, whichever Republican ultimately is found to have won. West of Chicago, Republicans also hope to win back the 14th congressional district house seat they had long held. In the Republican primary there, Ethan A. Hastert, the son of J. Dennis Hastert, the retired United States House speaker, was defeated by Randy Hultgren, a state legislator, to run against Representative Bill Foster, a scientist and Democrat who won the seat in 2008.
 Democrats, meanwhile, seemed equally optimistic that Mr. Kirk's house seat - the 10th congressional district which covers northern suburbs of Chicago - could shift party hands this fall. Dan Seals, a Democrat who twice ran against Mr. Kirk, was expected to face Robert Dold, a Republican and a businessman. 
 And in Cook County, which includes Chicago, Todd H. Stroger, the beleaguered county board president who oversees a $3 billion budget and tens of thousands of employees, was easily defeated in a Democratic primary. Mr. Stroger's father, John, the longtime president of the county board until he had a stroke, had long held an alliance with Mayor Richard M. Daley, but Mr. Daley endorsed no one this time.
 Toni Preckwinkle, a Chicago alderman in the South Side ward where Mr. Obama used to live, declared victory. ''Now is the time to repeal the Stroger sales tax,'' she said. ''Now is the time to end patronage.''

HEADLINE: Emerging Markets Help Dow Beat Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Dow Chemical posted a higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, but said demand in the United States and Europe remained weak.
 While results were strong in countries like China and India, the chemical maker's prices and sales fell in North America and Europe, indicating that those regions might not have fully recovered from the recession. 
 ''We see demand in emerging geographies continuing to show sustained growth, which bodes well for global growth,'' Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's chief executive, said in a statement. ''Growth will continue to lag in the U.S. and Europe, however.''
 Sales rose in four of Dow's seven business units, including basic plastics, where they rose 17 percent.
 Dow put its Styron unit up for sale last July and said at the time the unit could fetch $1 billion to $2 billion. Mr. Liveris said the sale process had been ''robust'' and that Dow could ''have something to report in the next month or so.''
 The company reported net income of $178 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.55 billion, or $1.68 a share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 18 cents a share. By that measure, analysts had expected 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Revenue rose 14.9 percent to $12.47 billion, from $10.85 billion in the quarter a year earlier, the company said. Analysts had expected revenue of $11.81 billion.
 Profit from joint ventures, including a 50 percent stake in Dow Corning, jumped to $219 million from a $4 million loss a year earlier and were nearly in line with prerecession levels, Dow said.
 Dow's shares fell $1.06, or 3.7 percent, to $27.57 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: White House Continues Policy Outreach to G.O.P.

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and JEFF ZELENY; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Nashua, N.H.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Emboldened by the response to President Obama's face-off with House Republicans last week, the White House is intensifying its push to engage Congressional Republicans in policy negotiations as a way to share the burden of governing and put more scrutiny on Republican initiatives.
 Top aides say Mr. Obama intends to follow through quickly on his State of the Union proposal for bipartisan White House brainstorming sessions. Republicans will also be invited to the White House this weekend to watch the Super Bowl, as well as to Camp David and other venues for social visits. 
 The outreach represents a marked shift in both strategy and substance by Mr. Obama and his allies at a time when Democrats are adapting to the loss of their 60-vote supermajority in the Senate and the president has been losing support among independent voters. 
 The White House's goal is to show voters that Mr. Obama is willing to engage Republicans rather than govern in a partisan manner while forcing Republicans to make substantive compromises or be portrayed as obstructionist given their renewed power to block almost all legislation in the Senate.
 While the strategy addresses some of Mr. Obama's short-term political problems, it is not clear that it will help him with the more fundamental issue facing him as the leader of the party in power, which is showing voters results before Election Day, especially with unemployment in double digits and the health bill stalled. 
 For their part, Republicans said they were more than happy to showcase their proposals. They acknowledge that Democrats might have some ulterior motives in inviting more participation, but that it could still have benefits for both parties.
 Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, when asked if Democrats might be trying to create a treacherous political situation for Republicans, responded, ''They might be.''
 ''When we do policy and get good results, there is always the possibility that Democrats might gain a little politically,'' he said. ''But I think our main job here is to help the country.''
 On Tuesday in Nashua, N.H., Mr. Obama showcased the new approach, urging Republicans to come forward with their ideas while chiding them for their resistance to various initiatives in the hopes of achieving short-term political gain.
 ''I've said to the Republicans, show me what you've got,'' Mr. Obama told his audience while discussing the stalled health care legislation. ''You've been sitting on the sidelines criticizing what we're proposing.''
 ''You got a better idea,'' he added later, ''bring it on.''
 Many Democrats say they believe that Republicans have been able to gain the advantage over the past year by conducting ''hit and run'' political attacks that allow the opposition to tear down Democratic proposals without much attention being paid to the Republican alternatives. They say that increased engagement could remedy that disparity.
 In a new example of their efforts to showcase Republican ideas, House Democrats on Tuesday quickly jumped on one conservative Republican House leader's suggestion that promised Social Security and Medicare benefits need to be rethought for Americans under 55.
 ''I think it is very important that people see what the Republican proposals are,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. ''It is not that they are the party of no, they are the party of no new ideas. They want to turn back the clock and adopt the same Bush policies that got us back in this mess in the first place.''
 One example of the White House strategy is likely to play out around Mr. Obama's support for a bipartisan commission to recommend ways to reduce the deficit, a theme Mr. Obama touched on in New Hampshire. 
 Administration officials are trying to make the case that Republicans were responsible for driving up the national debt in the Bush years and that they share a responsibility for addressing the situation but are now walking away by opposing the commission that several had initially supported. That move, Democrats say, is evidence that Republicans are unwilling to play a constructive role.
 Some Republicans say that they are open to White House overtures but that the party should be wary. 
 ''If the president will consider some free-market economic principles and allow us to leave more money in the private sector rather than demagogue corporations and profits, we might have a chance to work on something,'' said Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina. ''But if it is just more government spending paid for by taxes on the job creators, it is hard to work with that.''
 The outreach is going on behind the scenes as well. David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, initiated a conversation late last year with Alex Castellanos, a leading Republican consultant. Over lunch at the White House mess, aides to both men said, the two had a frank discussion about the first year of the Obama presidency. The dialogue has continued.
 Mr. Castellanos said the president and Congressional Republicans could both benefit from stronger efforts at cooperation. But he said the latest discussions seemed to be rooted in political process rather than bridging policy differences.
 ''There is some naivete in a president who thinks that if you give everything to everyone then everyone will be happy,'' Mr. Castellanos said. ''This is arguing about the right way to get to the restaurant instead of what you're going to eat.''
 White House officials said the new approach could help repair Mr. Obama's standing among independent voters, who catapulted him into the White House but have distanced themselves partly because of the messy legislative debate over health care.
 Matthew Dowd, a moderate Republican strategist who was an adviser to President George W. Bush, said that increasing cooperation between the two parties was possible, but difficult given the institutional constraints of the system and Mr. Obama's role as the leading campaigner for House, Senate and governor's races.
 ''It's going to take the president deciding to be the head of the country, not the head of his party,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''It takes a serious amount of discipline and courage to do it.''

HEADLINE: In Texas, Resistance Over Stricter U.S. Smog Limits

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Environmentalists squared off against business groups and Texas state officials on Thursday at a hearing on the Obama administration's proposal to tighten standards for smog-producing pollutants, a change that could improve the health of millions but would impose burdensome costs on industry and local governments. 
 The hearing, before a panel of federal environmental officials, was one of three being held around the country on the proposed new standards, which would replace those set by the Bush administration in March 2008. Those standards, which set the limit for ozone at 75 parts per billion, ignored the advice of a panel of scientists advising the Environmental Protection Agency and have been challenged in court as too weak.
 But the Obama administration's proposal to reduce the acceptable level of ground-level ozone to from 60 to 70 parts per billion ran into stiff opposition here, where the oil and gas industry is king and the state environmental agency under Gov. Rick Perry, a conservative Republican, has been generally unwilling to crack down on polluters if it means sacrificing jobs. 
 The members of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, appointed by Mr. Perry, have made it plain they will fight the stricter standards and have called them arbitrary, unnecessary and unachievable. 
 At the hearing in a hotel ballroom, Michael Honeycutt, the director of toxicology for the Texas commission, questioned the evidence that a higher level of ozone is linked to more hospital admissions for lung problems. Mr. Honeycutt also declared that no ruling would fly in Texas if it required people to drive less or change their daily habits. 
 ''Programs that require lifestyle changes are unacceptable to the public,'' he said. 
 The proposed lower standards also drew fire from manufacturers and oil and gas companies, who fear they will bear the brunt of the costs of cutting down the volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides that cause smog. Some issued dire warnings of jobs being cut to pay for it. 
 ''It will have a devastating impact on the chemical industry,'' said Christina Wisdom, of the Texas Chemical Council.
 Debbie Hastings, a spokeswoman for the Texas Oil and Gas Association, said that refineries lacked the technology to reach the new goals solely through scrubbing the pollution coming out of smokestacks. Ms. Hastings pointed out that emissions from cars and trucks would have to be drastically cut, too. 
 ''At this point, I really don't think we think we can meet the standard,'' she said. But environmentalists and health groups, who generally applaud the proposed rule, scoffed at assertions that the petrochemical industry would be forced to slash jobs to meet the requirements. It was an empty threat, they said, pointing out that the federal government has steadily tightened air quality standards for decades without slowing economic growth.
 ''Historically, the benefits of cleaning up outweigh the costs three to one,'' said Janice Nolen, of the American Lung Association. The hearings were the first step in a process that will eventually produce a plan in each state for putting a new standard in place. A second hearing was held in Arlington, Va., on Tuesday and a third was planned in Sacramento on Wednesday. 
 Mayor Annise Parker of Houston said that she supported the stricter rules to protect the health of city dwellers, though she cautioned that the city would need years to reach the goal.

HEADLINE: Former Official Says Blair Lied to Hasten British Entry to Iraq War

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Only days after Tony Blair offered an impassioned defense of his decision to take Britain to war in Iraq, a cabinet minister who resigned over the war delivered a blistering condemnation of the former prime minister on Tuesday, accusing him of ''conning'' her and of deceiving his cabinet, the Parliament and the public in his resolve to have Britain join the United States in the invasion of 2003.
 Appearing before an official inquiry into the conflict, Clare Short provided an electrifying counterpoint to Mr. Blair's testimony on Friday. 
 Mr. Blair had called Saddam Hussein ''a monster,'' said he had no regrets about the war and warned that the same concerns that led to war over Iraq now applied to Iran and Western concerns that Tehran is secretly developing nuclear weapons.
 Ms. Short, who quit as international development minister two months after the invasion in 2003, repeatedly accused Mr. Blair of ''misleading'' her and other cabinet ministers about the advice he was getting from government lawyers who questioned the legality of invading Iraq. 
 On that issue, and on her written warnings of a ''humanitarian catastrophe'' in the invasion's wake, she said that Mr. Blair had effectively circumvented cabinet debate. Instead, she said, he had relied on an inner circle of ''his mates'' in government, having ''little chats'' with outsiders like herself and plying what she called a ''poodle-like'' relationship with the United States.
 She also accused Mr. Blair of deceit in his argument shortly before the invasion that France had said that it would veto a so-called ''second resolution'' in the United Nations Security Council approving military action against Iraq, and that it would not shift from that position under any circumstances. That allowed Mr. Blair to say he had exhausted the diplomatic possibilities for dealing with Mr. Hussein and cleared the way for fulfilling his pledge to fight at America's side.
 ''That was, in my view, a deliberate lie,'' Ms. Short said. ''It was one of the big deceits.'' She said the truth was that that the French president at the time, Jacques Chirac, could have been persuaded to back military action if London and Washington had been prepared to give United Nations weapons inspectors in Iraq more time. ''There was no emergency; no one had attacked anyone,'' she said. 
 ''There wasn't any new W.M.D,'' she added, referring to weapons of mass destruction. ''We could have taken the time and got it right.'' 
 There was little surprise in Ms. Short's bitterness toward Mr. Blair, whose relations with the former minister had long been strained by her role as a left-wing firebrand within the governing Labour Party. The more damaging element in her testimony might prove to be her revelations about the equivocal role played in the approach to the war by Mr. Blair's successor as prime minister, Gordon Brown, who was then Britain's finance minister and deeply estranged from Mr. Blair.
 Mr. Brown built on the party's anger about Iraq as he orchestrated Mr. Blair's resignation, and his own takeover as prime minister, in June 2007. In 10 Downing Street, he quickly set about accelerating the deadline for British troops to withdraw from Iraq, a process completed last summer, but did so while maintaining a wary distance from questions about his own role in the cabinet discussions in the months before the 2003 invasion.
 Ms. Short depicted Mr. Brown as positioning himself opportunistically by avoiding a clear commitment on the war. She said she had ''various cups of coffee'' with Mr. Brown, and found him to be ''very unhappy and marginalized,'' disillusioned over a range of government policies, but not specifically Iraq. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, however, when British and American troops had quickly defeated Saddam Hussein's forces, she said, ''Gordon was back with Tony and not having cups of coffee with me anymore.''
 Ms. Short's testimony seems likely to deepen the challenge facing Mr. Brown as he prepares for his own testimony later this month, when the inquiry panel seems sure to ask him -- in the face of deep public anger over the war -- whether he supported the invasion. After he bowed to left-wing discontent in the Labour Party and established the inquiry last year, Mr. Brown took criticism for his plan not to testify until after a general election that is expected in May, which was widely viewed as an attempt to duck a public accounting before votes are cast.
 But last month, Mr. Brown wrote to the inquiry saying he was ready to testify before the election, and the inquiry chairman, Sir John Chilcot, responded by saying the panel was happy to set aside its plan not to call current government ministers before the election if they were ready to appear sooner.

HEADLINE: The Tea Party Last Time

BYLINE: By ROBERT ZARETSKY. 
Robert Zaretsky, a professor of French history at the University of Houston Honors College, is the author of ''Albert Camus: Elements of a Life.''

DATELINE: Houston 

 BODY:
 MORE than 100,000 angry citizens united in the nation's capital to take their country back: back from the tax collector and the political and financial elites, back from bureaucrats and backroom wheelers and dealers and, more elusively and alarmingly, back from those who, well, were not like them.
 These weren't the incensed Americans who helped elect Scott Brown in the Massachusetts Senate race and who rallied around conservative candidates in the Illinois primary on Tuesday; this scene didn't take place at the Tea Party demonstration in Washington last year. These protesters were gathered in France a half-century ago: Last week was the 55th anniversary of the mass demonstration in Paris of the Poujadist movement, a phenomenon that bears a close resemblance to our own Tea Party. For a brief moment, the movement threatened the very foundations of the French Republic. A comparison between France then and America now may be instructive. 
 In the 1950s, postwar reconstruction and the Marshall Plan transformed France, which had been largely rural and agricultural, into a rapidly urbanizing and industrializing nation. While many welcomed these sweeping social and economic changes -- it was the era of Formica and frigos (refrigerators) -- many others feared and resented them. 
 Ever since the nation's liberation in 1945, a deep division had run down the middle of the French ideological spectrum: the Gaullists and Catholics on the one side, the Communists and their fellow travelers on the other. The political center had evaporated in the crucible of the cold war. The parliamentary system became ever more dysfunctional, lurching from one crisis to another as the competing parties accused one another of working against the interests of the man in the street.
 The man (and woman) in the street had a different take. Neither the traditional right nor left seemed interested in his plight. Inflation dogged his heels and the influx of consumer and cultural goods from America breathed ever more warmly on his neck. Yet in the face of this widespread anxiety, the professional political class seemed indifferent. At this critical moment, Pierre Poujade leapt onto the national stage. 
 A stationer in Saint-Cere, a small town in southwestern France, Poujade mobilized his fellow shopkeepers against government tax inspectors in 1953. He found a ready audience: le petit commercant was increasingly squeezed between the spread of chain stores and a heavy-handed state bureaucracy. 
 Poujade (who was, of course, the satisfied recipient of many state benefits, from retirement pensions to health insurance) channeled the swelling of popular resentment by creating the Union for the Defense of Shopkeepers and Artisans. By the end of the year, membership had rocketed, transforming the group from a provincial curiosity to a real and present danger to politics as usual.
 Short and barrel-chested -- he had once been a dockworker -- Poujade had a booming voice that amplified the anxiety of his populist followers. France's woes, he declared, were due to an urbane and urban professional class that had ''lost all contact with the real world.'' In his autobiography, titled ''I've Chosen to Fight,'' Poujade styled himself as a simple man of the people who had entered politics for selfless and patriotic reasons.
 The real France, he insisted, was found not in Paris, but in small towns and on farms. It was certainly not found in the person of France's most promising politician, Pierre Mendes-France, who as prime minister had acted on many of his campaign promises for meaningful economic and political change. For Poujade, the young and cerebral Mendes-France, a Sephardic Jew whose family had lived in France for several generations, was and would always be a foreigner.
 By Jan. 24, 1955, when the shopkeepers' group staged its huge rally in Paris, the movement's nostalgic longing for a simpler time had veered toward violent anti-parliamentarianism. There were also overtones of anti-Americanism (rumors flew that Coca-Cola had bought Notre-Dame with the intention of turning its western facade into a billboard) and anti-Semitism. The group's rallying cry -- Sortez les sortants! (''Throw the bums out!'') -- challenged the right as well as the left. 
 During the subsequent national elections, the Poujadists bulldozed their way into town meetings, shouting down opposing candidates and threatening violence: a grim rehearsal for Tea Party tactics during last year's health care debates. Their tactics, if not their platform -- they did not, in fact, have one -- worked. Poujade's party won more than 10 percent of the votes, taking more than 50 seats in the National Assembly.
 The election, though, proved to be Poujade's swan song. He had demanded the nation's ear, but once he and his fellow deputies had it, they had nothing substantive to say. Slogans and placards were poor preparation for governance, and the group's rank and file soon either retreated from the political arena or joined the traditional right. 
 By 1958, most Poujadists were ready to throw their support behind a far more impressive opponent of the Fourth Republic, Charles de Gaulle. When de Gaulle assumed power and held a referendum that replaced the parliamentary system with an authoritarian executive, Poujade's former adherents overwhelmingly voted yes. As for Poujade himself, he had already become a footnote to French history.
 Historical parallelism is the duct tape of my profession: we apply it to the most disparate things. Sooner or later the tape frays, revealing unique fissures that require individual attention. Perhaps this is the case with the Poujadists and the Tea Partiers. Saint-Cere is far from Wasilla, Alaska; questioning Mendes-France's origins is not quite the same as demanding President Obama's birth certificate; the mendacity in the claim of France's imminent coca-colonization is of a different order from that concerning the than the misinformation about death panels in the United States. In both instances, however, the despair and disconnect with politics seem similarly great and real, as does the common tendency to grasp for simple solutions to complex problems. 
 Tea Party activists might find it infuriating ever to be compared to the nation they consider the anti-America. But French observers of our country may be forgiven if they feel a certain deja vu when they see a movement that brings nothing to the ballot box except anger.

HEADLINE: A Clean Break With Staid Detergent Ads

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ONE of the biggest -- and dullest -- categories in consumer marketing is showing signs of life.
 The category is laundry detergents, prosaic products whose advertising budgets have financed decades of soap operas and women's magazines, not to mention enough coupon inserts to fill a googol of Sunday newspapers. (Yes, before there was ''Google'' there was ''googol.'')
 The detergent business is emblematic of what is known as a low-interest category, a marketing term that means most consumers would rather watch paint dry than a commercial for such everyday products. 
 One reason the category has become so staid was the victory that the leader, Procter & Gamble, won in the United States over its two longtime nemeses, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever. So commanding a lead did Procter build in the detergent market with brands like Tide and Cheer that the two other rivals left the field and sold rights to their brands -- among them, Ajax, All, Dynamo, Fab, Surf and Wisk -- to other companies.
 But in the last couple of years, shoppers have shown renewed interest in detergents. 
 The recent economic woes have spurred sales of lower-price products from marketers like Arm & Hammer and the Dial division of Henkel. Also, detergents meant to be environmentally friendly have been gaining favor, among them brands like Green Works, from Clorox; Seventh Generation; and Vaska.
 Enter Method, the cleaning-products company with a green, and quirky, persona that is summarized in its corporate mantra, ''People against dirty.'' Method is introducing a detergent in a campaign with a budget estimated at $10 million. 
 The campaign, now under way, takes the cheeky tone typical of Method's marketing by mocking mainstream products as feeding a household's heinous ''jug'' habit -- jugs being the large, handled bottles that rival brands use rather than the small pump bottles of Method.
 ''Say no to jugs,'' the headlines of print and online ads declare. Other ads proclaim that Method stands ''for a jug-free America.''
 And the following is a sequence of online banner ads: ''Are you a jug addict? Frequently overdosing? Heavy and bloated? We can help. Get off the jugs and get clean.'' 
 The campaign, by Droga5 in New York, can also be seen on a microsite, or special Web site, methodlaundry.com. 
 The ads also paint a giant target on Tide, which is America's best-selling detergent, by showing the Method product in front of a large orange jug with a blue cap. Although the jug is unlabeled, it is clearly clad in Tide's trade dress.
 ''We use the jug as the monster our challenger brand wants to slay,'' said Eric Ryan, a founder of Method, based in San Francisco, who is the company's chief brand architect.
 ''We need to go through the door of the category,'' he added, referring to Tide, to demonstrate that ''our laundry detergent is superior to the one they're using today.''
 ''Laundry habits are ingrained early in life and people think of themselves as closed off to change,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''They head down the laundry aisle on autopilot.''
 ''Our challenge is getting consumers to rethink how they do laundry,'' he added, on a ''small budget'' compared with those of Tide and other traditional detergent brands.
 The pun-filled ads comparing laundry habits to drug habits are intended to be ''provocative enough'' to be noticed, Mr. Ryan said, but not to generate complaints.
 Method knows too well about maintaining that balance. 
 In November, the company and Droga5 introduced a parody video clip that was styled like a commercial for a make-believe conventional cleaning product named Shiny Suds. The online video featured talking Suds bubbles that were malevolent, representing what Method considers to be the harsh or hazardous chemicals in competitive products.
 To underline their nasty nature, the Suds were shown leering at a woman while she showered. Among the many comments about the video on Web sites were hundreds that complained the clip degraded women and condoned sexual harassment. Chastened, Method withdrew the video.
 ''We were taken aback a little bit by a vocal minority,'' said David Droga, creative chairman at Droga5. ''It was something we didn't anticipate.''
 ''But this is a people-focused company,'' he said of Method, ''so we had to respond to those concerns.''
 As for the brazenness of likening detergent jugs to drugs, Mr. Droga described it as ''the starting point to create a conversation.''
 Asked what he would do if Nancy Reagan were to complain about Method making light of her ''Just say no'' campaign, Mr. Droga replied: ''If Nancy Reagan complains, it's all good. Nancy Reagan has dirty laundry, just like anyone else.''
 Mr. Ryan said: ''We never want to offend anybody. When you're trying to provoke change, it's a challenging line to walk.''
 The print ads for the detergent are to appear in March through September issues of magazines like Family Circle, People and Real Simple. The digital ads are to run from Feb. 16 through the end of May.
 Method is also supplying about 200 of what the company calls its ''top-tier advocates,'' or dedicated customers, with detergent samples for themselves and friends.
 Method must try to elicit interest in its detergent without getting Procter & Gamble so annoyed that it would, say, introduce a version of Tide in a small pump bottle.
 Procter, too, wants to capitalize on the new interest in the detergent category. It has introduced a campaign for Tide, carrying the theme ''Style is an option. Clean is not,'' and a campaign for Cheer featuring humorous video clips online (cheer.com/brighten-bay).

HEADLINE: Health Care Changed, but St. Vincent's Didn't

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For more than 150 years, St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan has been a beacon in Greenwich Village, serving poets, writers, artists, winos, the poor and the working-class, and gay people.
 It has treated victims of calamities: the cholera epidemic of 1849, the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, the 9/11 attack and, just last year, the Hudson River landing of US Airways Flight 1549. The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay got her middle name from the hospital, where her uncle's life was saved in 1892 after he was accidentally locked in the hold of a ship for several days without food or water. 
 But today the hospital is struggling, and last week, in what could mean the death knell of the last Roman Catholic general hospital in New York City, a chain of hospitals proposed to take over St. Vincent's, shut down its inpatient beds and most of its emergency room services, and convert it into an outpatient center tied to hospitals uptown and on the East Side.
 Gov. David A. Paterson's office said on Tuesday the state was extending a $6 million emergency loan to help St. Vincent's meet its payroll, an indication of how dire its finances had become. 
 How St. Vincent's went from a cherished neighborhood institution to one threatened with extinction is a chronicle of increasingly troubled management whose problems were made worse by the economics of the health care industry, changes in the fabric of a historic neighborhood and the low profit potential in religious work.
 It was once part of the Roman Catholic Church's social and political network in New York City, a cradle-to-grave embrace of parishioners who were born in Catholic hospitals, educated in parochial schools, married in the church and given last rites by a priest.
 Last week, a day after the announcement of the proposed takeover, members of the Sisters of Charity, the Catholic order of nuns that founded the hospital in 1849, gathered for a noon Mass at St. Vincent's second-floor chapel and vowed to fight. ''We are not going away,'' said Sister Jane Iannucelli, vice chairwoman of the hospital board, standing in the light of stained glass windows. 
 ''One of the things that's so crucial to the Sisters of Charity is serving the poor,'' she said.
 It was that very calling, some industry executives suggested, that may have helped make the hospital obsolete.
 ''Helping the poor is indeed the mission and the cause celebre,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospitals Association, a trade group. ''Therein lies the dilemma.''
 Other hospitals emphasize high-tech care and rush to invest in the fancy equipment and celebrity doctors that attract patients with the means to pay for them; St. Vincent's sticks to its motto of ''compassionate care,'' rooted in its origins as a place that trained nurses and that was under the auspices of nuns.
 As the Village changed, becoming home to more middle-class families, by many accounts St. Vincent's failed to change with it. In 2007, several years after an ill-fated merger with other Catholic hospitals, St. Vincent's management proposed selling off its maze of outdated buildings around Seventh Avenue and 12th Street to build a state-of-the-art high-rise building across the street, to be designed by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners Architects, famous for cutting-edge projects like the glass pyramid expansion of the Louvre museum in Paris and the John Hancock Tower in Boston. 
 But some said it was too late. In an indication of how St. Vincent's reputation had fallen in the neighborhood, during a fierce debate over whether to demolish a low-rise Modernist building to make way for the new hospital, the actors Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins suggested that St. Vincent's no longer served the neighborhood well.
 ''I would not want to bring my children there,'' Ms. Sarandon declared at a landmarks preservation hearing.
 At the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, St. Vincent's ministered to those affected, and was bursting at the seams. But by the 1990s, drugs and public awareness helped bring AIDS under control, and the Village's wealthy newcomers were choosing other hospitals.
 From 1996 to 2007, the most recent year for which figures are available, the number of patients the hospital admitted went down by 10 percent, while the rate for hospitals citywide was flat, state records show. 
 And its emergency room volume has been growing faster than the citywide rate, suggesting that it has the worst of both worlds -- more emergency room patients and fewer inpatient admissions, which are where the money is.
 St. Vincent's is a major city contractor for homeless services, and hospital administrators said that homeless people from all over the city find their way there for treatment.
 In short, many of the patients who frequent St. Vincent's are part of the old Village rather than the new Village, as was clear from a tour of the emergency room last week. It was electric with activity, every bed filled. Many of the patients were elderly, from Chinatown, or grizzled remnants of the Village's old working class. Nuns from Mother Theresa's order hovered about. 
 The room, like other parts of the hospital, had a homey feeling, more like a place television's kindly Dr. Marcus Welby would have taken his patients rather than the overly caffeinated environment of ''House.''
 ''There's a sense we're here for the mission, and it truly permeates,'' said Dr. Eric Legome, the chairman of emergency medicine.
 Despite 62,000 emergency visits, nearly 1,800 births, almost 22,000 hospital admissions and 263,000 outpatient visits a year, according to St. Vincent's officials, the hospital is bleeding red ink, and has been for years.
 Hospital officials, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of negotiations with Continuum Health Partners, the chain that has offered to take over the hospital, said the hospital was close to having to declare bankruptcy for the second time since 2005. It is about $700 million in debt.
 Officials blamed a high rate of poor and uninsured patients as well as cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and the hospital's inability to negotiate favorable contracts with health insurance companies, claiming their fees were 30 percent below the market rate.
 Catholic hospitals in some parts of the country continue to thrive, but the New York City hospital field is much different from what it was 100 years ago; New Yorkers with health insurance now can choose from a number of prestigious hospitals. 
 To remain competitive, in 2000 St. Vincent's merged with several other Catholic hospitals to form St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers. 
 Along with the flagship hospital in the Village, it ran seven other hospitals: Bayley Seton and St. Vincent's on Staten Island; Mary Immaculate, St. John's and St. Joseph's in Queens; St. Mary's in Brooklyn; and St. Vincent's Westchester, in Harrison, N.Y. It was also affiliated with St. Vincent's Midtown, formerly St. Clare's, in Midtown Manhattan.
 The merger was conceived as a way to streamline management and give the hospitals pricing leverage, but it was troubled from the beginning. After closings and sales, the network was left with just one New York City hospital, the flagship; a psychiatric and substance abuse treatment hospital in Westchester; and several nursing homes and other outpatient facilities. Some of St. Vincent's debt was inherited from the closed hospitals.
 Over the last few years, St. Vincent's has tried to polish its image, recruiting the Giants quarterback Eli Manning and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to raise money and attract customers.
 It has traditionally been one of the beneficiaries of the Alfred E. Smith Foundation Dinner, an annual charity roast at the Waldorf-Astoria, where John McCain and Barack Obama traded jabs just before the 2008 election. The hospital's chairman is Alfred E. Smith IV, a prominent Wall Street investment banker and the great-grandson of the New York governor who ran for president in 1928. Mr. Smith did not respond to a request for an interview.
 In 2004, St. Vincent's turned over management to Speltz & Weis, the first in a series of turnaround consultants. It paid the firms millions of dollars a year to run the hospital and hired their officials as hospital executives. The system filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early July 2005, when it appeared, according to court papers filed by hospital creditors, that it would be unable to make its payroll.
 In a lawsuit filed in 2007, some of the hospital's creditors painted a picture of a hospital system trapped between unscrupulous consultants and a passive or gullible board. The lawsuit accused David E. Speltz and Timothy C. Weis, the hospital system's former chief executive and chief financial officer, of delaying the bankruptcy organization while they and their consulting firm collected millions of dollars in fees.
 The lawsuit accused them of hiring high-priced contractors and padding their fees, instead of using hospital employees to do work. And it says they leveraged their positions with the hospital to negotiate the sale of their consulting company to Huron Consulting Group, in Chicago, also a defendant in the case.
 From 2004 until the lawsuit was filed, St. Vincent's paid Speltz & Weis, which was based in New Hampshire, $30.8 million and Huron $1.2 million in fees and expenses, according to court papers.
 The expenses included a personal membership in a private university club; trips to New York for spouses; hundreds of dinners in Manhattan restaurants' opera tickets; groceries, dry cleaning and laundry bills; and travel and housing fees for consultants from outside New York, according to court papers.
 Lawyers for Mr. Speltz and Mr. Weis did not return calls for comment. But they said in court papers that the creditors had written a ''revisionist'' history of events that unfairly blamed their clients for a bankruptcy that was actually caused by a $60 million shortfall in accounts receivable that had not been detected by auditors. Their firm had to bring in contractors for important jobs because previous St. Vincent's managers had unwisely eliminated key positions, the lawyers said. The lawsuit is headed for mediation.
 The current chief executive, Henry J. Amoroso, is its fourth since 2004. He did not respond to requests for comment. St. Vincent's board announced last weekend that it had retained another crisis management firm, Grant Thornton.
 Sister Jane, the vice chairwoman, acknowledged that the hospital was on the precipice. ''We have had enough money to pay our salaries,'' she said, but added, ''The cash flow has gotten tighter and tighter, and yes, we are in a very vulnerable position.''
 Last Thursday night, more than 500 people crowded into a basement meeting room at Our Lady of Pompeii Church on Carmine Street to protest the proposed takeover. One man, Mark Leonard, spoke of how a nurse offered to come to his house and baby-sit after he took home his very fragile twins from the St. Vincent's intensive care unit.
 ''You guys must be exhausted,'' he remembered the nurse calling to say. ''You need a night out with your wife.''
 Nancy Spannbauer, a program director for the Penn South senior citizens' program in Chelsea, told of how she had been in the home of a 91-year-old woman a few days earlier while a doctor tried to get the woman to go to the hospital.
 ''Eventually she gave in,'' Ms. Spannbauer said. ''And she said, 'Well, I suppose if I have to, I'll only go to St. Vincent's.' ''

HEADLINE: In Senate Panel, Concern Over Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's budget came in for sharp criticism on Tuesday from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers who said the White House was not doing enough to reduce the deficit in the medium and long term. 
 The president's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, sat through more than 90 minutes of bipartisan criticism at a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee.
 The panel's chairman, Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said he generally agreed with the president's approach in the short term, because additional spending could prevent the economy from slipping back into recession.
 But Mr. Conrad said: ''I have strong disagreement with the president over the long term. I don't see a focus on reducing the long-term deficit.''
 ''We are running outsized risks in the long term,'' Mr. Conrad said. Under the president's budget, Mr. Conrad noted, federal debt held by the public will grow rapidly compared with the size of the economy -- rising to 64 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 and 73 percent in 2015, from 53 percent in 2009. 
 Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the committee, was more harsh in his criticism.
 ''The president's budget is filled with small ideas and smaller actions'' to address the long-term deficit, Mr. Gregg said, adding: ''It's a death certificate to the American dream for our children. Their lives will be mortgaged by the debt we put on their backs.''
 For this year, Mr. Obama projects a deficit of nearly $1.6 trillion, equivalent to 10.6 percent of economic output. 
 Mr. Orszag said the Obama administration had inherited a weak economy ''on the verge of a severe collapse.'' He said that new spending and tax cuts for small businesses were needed to ''jump-start job creation.''
 But Mr. Gregg said, ''What this administration inherited is not as important as what our children will inherit.''

HEADLINE: No Aid or Rebound in Sight, More Homeowners Just Walk Away

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
In 2006, Benjamin Koellmann bought a condominium in Miami Beach. By his calculation, it will be about the year 2025 before he can sell his modest home for what he paid. Or maybe 2040. 
 ''People like me are beginning to feel like suckers,'' Mr. Koellmann said. ''Why not let it go in default and rent a better place for less?''
 After three years of plunging real estate values, after the bailouts of the bankers and the revival of their million-dollar bonuses, after the Obama administration's loan modification plan raised the expectations of many but satisfied only a few, a large group of distressed homeowners is wondering the same thing. 
 New research suggests that when a home's value falls below 75 percent of the amount owed on the mortgage, the owner starts to think hard about walking away, even if he or she has the money to keep paying. 
 In a situation without precedent in the modern era, millions of Americans are in this bleak position. Whether, or how, to help them is one of the biggest questions the Obama administration confronts as it seeks a housing policy that would contribute to the economic recovery. 
 ''We haven't yet found a way of dealing with this that would, we think, be practical on a large scale,'' the assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, Herbert M. Allison Jr., said in a recent briefing.
 The number of Americans who owed more than their homes were worth was virtually nil when the real estate collapse began in mid-2006, but by the third quarter of 2009, an estimated 4.5 million homeowners had reached the critical threshold, with their home's value dropping below 75 percent of the mortgage balance.
 They are stretched, aggrieved and restless. With figures released last week showing that the real estate market was stalling again, their numbers are now projected to climb to a peak of 5.1 million by June -- about 10 percent of all Americans with mortgages.
 ''We're now at the point of maximum vulnerability,'' said Sam Khater, a senior economist with First American CoreLogic, the firm that conducted the recent research. ''People's emotional attachment to their property is melting into the air.''
 Suggestions that people would be wise to renege on their home loans are at least a couple of years old, but they are turning into a full-throated barrage. Bloggers were quick to note recently that landlords of an 11,000-unit residential complex in Manhattan showed no hesitation, or shame, in walking away from their deeply underwater investment. 
 ''Since the beginning of December, I've advised 60 people to walk away,'' said Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Ariz. ''Everyone has lost hope. They don't qualify for modifications, and being on the hamster wheel of paying for a property that is not worth it gets so old.''
 Mr. Walsh is taking his own advice, recently defaulting on a rental property he owns. ''The sun will come up tomorrow,'' he said.
 The difference between letting your house go to foreclosure because you are out of money and purposefully defaulting on a mortgage to save money can be murky. But a growing body of research indicates that significant numbers of borrowers are declining to live under what some waggishly call ''house arrest.''
 Using credit bureau data, consultants at Oliver Wyman calculated how many borrowers went straight from being current on their mortgage to default, rather than making spotty payments. They also weeded out owners having trouble paying other bills. Their estimate was that about 17 percent of owners defaulting in 2008, or 588,000 people, chose that option as a strategic calculation. 
 Some experts argue that walking away from mortgages is more discussed than done. People hate moving; their children attend the neighborhood school; they do not want to think of themselves as skipping out on a debt. Doubters cite a Federal Reserve study using historical data from Massachusetts that concludes there were relatively few walk-aways during the 1991 bust. 
 The United States Treasury falls into the skeptical camp.
 ''The overwhelming bulk of people who have negative equity stay in their homes and keep paying,'' said Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions. 
 It would cost about $745 billion, slightly more than the size of the original 2008 bank bailout, to restore all underwater borrowers to the point where they were breaking even, according to First American. 
 Using government money to do that would be seen as unfair by many taxpayers, Mr. Barr said. On the other hand, doing nothing about underwater mortgages could encourage more walk-aways, dealing another blow to a fragile economy.
 ''It's not an easy area,'' he said.
 Walking away -- also called ''jingle mail,'' because of the notion that homeowners just mail their keys to the bank, setting off foreclosure proceedings -- began in the Southwest during the 1980s oil collapse, though it has never been clear how widespread it was.
 In the current bust, lenders first noticed something strange after real estate prices had fallen about 10 percent.
 An executive with Wachovia, one of the country's biggest and most aggressive lenders, said during a conference call in January 2008 that the bank was bewildered by customers who had ''the capacity to pay, but have basically just decided not to.'' (Wachovia failed nine months later and was bought by Wells Fargo. ) 
 With prices now down by about 30 percent, underwater borrowers fall into two groups. Some have owned their homes for many years and got in trouble because they used the house as a cash machine. Others, like Mr. Koellmann in Miami Beach, made only one mistake: they bought as the boom was cresting.
 It was April 2006, a moment when the perpetual rise of real estate was considered practically a law of physics. Mr. Koellmann was 23, a management consultant new to Miami. 
 Financially cautious by nature, he bought a small, plain one-bedroom apartment for $215,000, much less than his agent told him he could afford. He put down 20 percent and received a fixed-rate loan from Countrywide Financial.
 Not quite four years later, apartments in the building are selling in foreclosure for $90,000. 
 ''There is no financial sense in staying,'' Mr. Koellmann said. With the $1,500 he is paying each month for his mortgage, taxes and insurance, he could rent a nicer place on the beach, one with a gym, security and valet parking. 
 Walking away, he knows, is not without peril. At minimum, it would ruin his credit score. Mr. Koellmann would like to attend graduate school. If an admission dean sees a dismal credit record, would that count against him? How about a new employer?
 Most of all, though, he struggles with the ethical question.
 ''I took a loan on an asset that I didn't see was overvalued,'' he said. ''As much as I would like my bank to pay for that mistake, why should it?''
 That is an attitude Wall Street would like to encourage. David Rosenberg, the chief economist of the investment firm Gluskin Sheff, wrote recently that borrowers were not victims. They ''signed contracts, and as adults should also be held accountable,'' he wrote.
 Of course, this is not necessarily how Wall Street itself behaves, as demonstrated by the case of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. An investment group led by the real estate giant Tishman Speyer recently defaulted on $4.4 billion in debt that it had used to buy the two apartment developments in Manhattan, handing the properties back to the lenders.
 Moreover, during the boom, it was the banks that helped drive prices to unrealistic levels by lowering credit standards and unleashing a wave of speculative housing demand. 
 Mr. Koellmann applied last fall to Bank of America for a modification, noting that his income had slipped. But the lender came back a few weeks ago with a plan that added more restrictive terms while keeping the payments about the same.
 ''That may have been the last straw,'' Mr. Koellmann said.
 Guy D. Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance magazine, says he does not hear much sympathy from lenders for their underwater customers.
 ''The banks tell me that a lot of people who are complaining were the ones who refinanced and took all the equity out any time there was any appreciation,'' he said. ''The banks are damned if they will help.''
 Joe Figliola has heard that message. He bought his house in Elgin, Ill., in 2004, then refinanced twice to get better terms. He pulled out a little money both times to cover the closing costs and other expenses. Now his place is underwater while his salary as circulation manager for the local newspaper has been cut.
 ''It doesn't seem right that I can rent a place somewhere for half of what I'm paying,'' he said. ''I told my bank, 'Just take a little bite out of what I owe. That would ease me up. Isn't that why the president gave you all this money?' ''
 Bank of America did not agree, so Mr. Figliola, who is 48, sees no recourse other than walking away. ''I don't believe this is the right thing to do,'' he said, ''but I've got to survive.''

HEADLINE: Calorie Counters

 BODY:
This might come as an unpleasant surprise for the fast-food industry, but when people can read how many calories there are in their fast food, they do cut back. In a study of millions of transactions at several hundred Starbucks outlets, economists from Stanford University found that consumers in New York City responded to required calorie postings by cutting almost 15 calories off their average purchases, a calorie reduction of 6 percent. 
 Drinks were mostly unaffected. Customers instead bought less food with their drinks and, to a lesser extent, bought lower-calorie items. The policy was particularly effective with heavier eaters. A separate analysis of purchases by Starbucks cardholders found that customers who consumed at least 250 calories per purchase cut their intake by 26 percent after the postings appeared.
 This research seems to contradict the findings of an earlier study that found that calorie postings at 14 outlets of McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King and KFC in low-income New York City neighborhoods had no discernible impact on customers' purchases in subsequent weeks. 
 The research at Starbucks relied on many more transactions and outlets over more than a year, so it is more precise. And despite the discrepancy, both studies seem to suggest similar conclusions: calorie counts will be most effective in higher-income neighborhoods, where consumers are better educated. And they will work better when consumers have a choice of places -- with lower-calorie alternatives -- to eat.
 The Starbucks study covered all outlets in the city and found that customers cut more calories in higher-income ZIP codes and ZIP codes with a higher share of people with college degrees. It found that when there was a Dunkin' Donuts nearby, Starbucks did more business.
 The average decline in calorie intake reported at Starbucks is still relatively small, especially when one considers the epidemic of obesity in this country. Still, the fast-food industry's argument that calorie counts on their menus would make no difference is clearly wrong.
 If anything, the results of the survey suggest that calorie postings should be supplemented by efforts to draw chain restaurants that offer healthier foods into poorer neighborhoods. And more effort should go into educating people about the health consequences of obesity. That way customers would be in a better position to consider the calorie counts posted alongside their favorite foods and make healthier choices.

HEADLINE: Judge Says State Must Pay Farmer's Legal Fees

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
New York State picked the wrong farmer to fight. 
 On Wednesday, a state judge ruled that the Adirondack Park Agency will have to pay the legal fees and expenses of Salim B. Lewis, a former Wall Street executive who is one of the state's largest organic farmers. The ruling was the latest chapter in what has become a tortuous and embarrassing case for the park agency, which is facing growing scrutiny and anger upstate. 
 The Lewis farm sits on roughly 1,200 acres in Essex, N.Y., and is considered one of the state's most innovative farms. The park agency began a legal fight with the farm in 2006, contending that Mr. Lewis did not obtain permits from the agency before starting to build three houses for their farm workers. In 2008, top officials in the Paterson administration defended the case and the park agency. 
 But last July, in a 5-0 ruling, a state appellate court affirmed a lower court's ruling in favor of Lewis farm, and rejected arguments that the agency had jurisdiction over the housing. 
 Mr. Lewis said Wednesday that ''the A.P.A. has not only destroyed the economy of this region but made it prohibitively expensive to fight them.'' He added, ''If the A.P.A. keeps doing this, this farm and other farms up here will go out of business.''
 Keith McKeever, a park agency spokesman, said of the decision, ''We're reviewing it, and we're definitely disappointed.''
 Mr. Lewis has asked for more than $200,000 in legal fees, but the amount that the state will actually have to pay is to be determined. Judge Richard B. Meyer, an acting State Supreme Court justice, set a hearing on the issue for Feb. 26.

HEADLINE: In Wake of Devastation, Calculating a Debt to Haiti

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sandor@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Nearly 20 years ago, Rawlings Sporting Goods closed its baseball assembly plant in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and completed a move to its other factory in Costa Rica. Rawlings cited Haiti's political instability for idling about 1,000 workers.
 Now, almost a month after the earthquake that caused innumerable deaths and widespread suffering and devastation, does Rawlings have a duty to send some business back to Haiti? 
 Major League Baseball should prod Rawlings, its official baseball supplier since 1977, to consider such a move as one way to try to help Haiti. But Bud Selig & Company can no more demand that Rawlings heads back to Haiti than the company can tell M.L.B. whom to sell the Texas Rangers to. 
 And although there would be public relations value to returning to Haiti, there are great challenges. Companies willing to invest there know it will take substantial time to rebuild the infrastructure, institutions and housing needed to make major investments pay off in a country plagued by extreme poverty and sky-high unemployment.
 ''Do they have an obligation?'' Josh DeWind, a co-author of ''Aiding Migration: The Impact of International Development Assistance on Haiti,'' said Tuesday in a telephone interview, referring to Rawlings. ''I suppose they did quite well in Haiti, so, yes, in a humanitarian sense, it would be morally right to go back and help out, given that they benefited from Haiti.'' 
 He added that the despot Jean-Claude Duvalier helped foster the low-cost business environment ''by making sure there were no independent unions.'' DeWind said Rawlings was not alone in paying its workers ''what the World Bank called less than the minimum daily amount to support a family.'' 
 Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986 and, in the chaotic years afterward, Rawlings and other companies left.
 Rawlings found peace at its baseball factory in Turrialba, Costa Rica. A small division within the Jarden Corporation, a conglomerate in Rye, N.Y., Rawlings is a licensee that pays royalties to baseball and provides teams with 110 dozen free baseballs each season. Teams pay a discounted price for additional balls, with teams buying 2,500 dozen to 3,500 dozen more per season. 
 Bob DuPuy, the president of M.L.B., which contributed $1 million to Haitian relief, declined to say whether he would push Rawlings to relocate any baseball production.
 ''This is the time for humanitarian concern, concerns about the victims and life support, and dealing with the horrific trauma that's been caused,'' he said.
 But DuPuy indicated that a conversation with Rawlings about Haiti might occur after ''some form of normalcy takes over.''
 Mark Schneider, a senior vice president of the International Crisis Group, said that incentives like no tariffs on apparel made in Haiti and exported to the United States helped make the country attractive to companies.
 Before the earthquake, he said, there were positive economic developments: employment in apparel factories was rising; Royal Caribbean Cruises announced a $55 million investment in the northern port of Labadee; and the investor George Soros announced a plan to invest in a partnership to build a new free-trade zone. 
 In October, hundreds of company executives, bankers and officials of nongovernmental organizations attended a two-day investment conference in Port-au-Prince that was organized by the Inter-American Development Bank and former President Bill Clinton. A survey by the bank, which provides grants to Haiti, found that the gathering had yielded plans for more than 10 projects worth over $5 million, said a spokesman, Pablo Bachelet.
 Schneider would not say if a company like Rawlings would find Haiti, after the relief effort ahead, more attractive than Costa Rica. But, he added, ''What you can say is that there are distinct advantages that will make it attractive for a company to consider, for example, expanding production to Haiti.''
 No executive of Jarden would speak for the record. Evan Goetz, a spokesman for the company, said, ''There is no plan to relocate production facilities to Haiti.'' 
 No one should expect a firm plan from Rawlings right now. But it should study the issue.
 Julie T. Katzman, general manager of a microfinancing fund at the Inter-American Development Bank, said companies like Rawlings could not be expected to invest solely out of moral obligation. 
 ''It's important that a company do something not only out of a social responsibility but how it fits its core enterprise,'' she said. ''Certainly, you go into Haiti now and there's a certain amount of dislocation. It takes a commitment, but in the medium and long term, it should be a sustainable place for manufacturing.''
 She suggested that if Rawlings did not want to produce baseballs in Haiti again, it could make apparel.
 Still, Steven J. Puig, the bank's vice president for private sector operations, said there was a good-deed side to investing in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
 ''Going forward,'' he said, ''just the seal on any product that says 'Made in Haiti' will have a different connotation, which will reflect that a company is contributing to a better world.''

HEADLINE: The Trials of a Former Boy Wonder

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
IT was late into the night last April 30, after a lavish dinner at La Grenouille honoring the 100th anniversary of Cartier, when Zac Posen, the precocious designer, took a seat next to Glenda Bailey, the editor of Harper's Bazaar and the evening's hostess. 
 Mr. Posen was upset about what he perceived to be a slight of his work in the magazine, and he surprised the editor -- and those around her -- with a confrontation. The designer, who confirmed the details of his complaint in a telephone interview this week, was offended that the magazine, which rarely featured his clothes, had asked him to appear in a fashion feature that paired designers with characters from ''Sesame Street.''
 He was supposed to stand next to the Count, the numerically inclined vampire (who happens to share the designer's hairline and fondness for wearing capes).
 ''I didn't want to model with the Count,'' Mr. Posen said. ''She said that was the only way my clothes could be in the magazine as a non-advertiser. I think she was surprised I wouldn't take the part, but I stood my ground and I still do.'' 
 In fashion, it is considered poor form to air one's grievances in public, let alone at a party, and directly to an editor in chief; and yet Mr. Posen, in his meteoric career since founding his company in 2001, around the time of his 21st birthday, has never allowed decorum to stand in the way of his tongue. He has bristled at editors for any number of offenses, not the least of which was when they described him as a ''young designer.'' Mr. Posen knew he was bigger than that, no matter his age.
 And, in a way, he had a point.
 There was a time when brashness was a refreshing change in New York fashion, which had been dominated by a handful of aging mega-brands until Mr. Posen planted his flag in the biggest, most expensive tent in Bryant Park. But his extravagant success came so quickly, perhaps faster than his limited experience should have allowed, that his setbacks echo all the more loudly. He became unpredictable, lashing out at the news media as his company struggled with layoffs, a revolving door of executives and an investor pulling back the reins. He was the designer wunderkind who went too far, too fast, his sequins falling to the floor like the feathers of Icarus.
 ''This is survival mode,'' Mr. Posen said in an interview in December, shortly after a round of articles about his business troubles and the departure of top executives. Those included Laura O'Connor, the president, who had joined the company in 2008.
 New York, before the recession, was a breeding ground for young designers, overrun with labels that became overnight sensations merely because the industry willed them to be so, a phenomenon that can largely be traced to the example of Zac Posen. Young and connected, he had the attention of important fashion people while he was still a teenager, working as an intern for the designer Nicole Miller and building a network of friends that would include the children of famous artists, magazine editors, actors and President George W. Bush. When Naomi Campbell wore a dress he made -- while he was still a student at a London arts college -- it seemed as if it was his destiny to become a famous fashion designer. Now young designers think good looks plus diploma equals business plan.
 As Mr. Posen put it: ''The variables have become pretty clear. Do you feel comfortable having your photo taken? And can you talk, and get sponsorship? I mean, it's really that crude.''
 But if his extravagant success is emblematic of a certain period of recent fashion history that was driven by excess, then what is to become of the designer and his ilk in a post-recession, post-luxury world? In December, Phi, another favorite of fashion editors, was shuttered. Before that, it was Christian Lacroix. 
 Mr. Posen's studio is in a loft building in TriBeCa. It is a warren of offices that have been combined over the years. It has room to house a jeans collection, fragrances and a retail operation, most of which have yet to materialize, leaving a lot of open space. He knows the rap against him, that he can appear pretentious, that he prefers the limelight to the hard work of making clothes. 
 ''I think, in the last year, I grew up,'' said Mr. Posen, 29. During that time, employees who had been hired to develop a lower-priced line had been let go when the project was put on hold. With the remaining staff, Mr. Posen developed two new collections: a different lower-priced line, Z Spoke, that will be sold at Saks Fifth Avenue beginning March 1, and a fast-fashion collection for Target in April. 
 ''I've burned bridges and I've built bridges,'' he said, ''and I'm really just listening to my own voice now, and taking responsibility for it as well.''
 Lately, Mr. Posen has been reading the works of John Fairchild, the retired publisher of Women's Wear Daily, who chronicled the rise of society designers in his book ''Chic Savages.'' Mr. Fairchild's battles with designers were legendary, including a longstanding ban of Geoffrey Beene from the pages of Women's Wear that lasted almost without pause until Mr. Beene's obituary appeared in 2004. Mr. Posen also talked of studying Charles James, the fabulously eccentric designer who, in the 1950s, almost never showed his work to the news media.
 ''It sounds like everybody who has craft and integrity doesn't allow the journalists in,'' he said. 
 Perhaps he allowed them to get too close. There was always a sense, even as a really young designer, that he was a showman trying to project a sense of grandness, when what he was good at was making wearable bias-cut dresses with kicky insets that were flattering to many body types. His spring 2004 collection, one of the best received, included satin dresses inspired by the insides of seashells and a raffia ball gown. The following season he wowed editors with a show called ''Blixen,'' interpreted by some critics as a reference to the German word for lightning (blitz) and by others as a nod to the reindeer because there was a lot of fur. 
 The turnout for his shows was tremendous, with Julianne Moore, Bette Midler, the president's daughters and Sean Combs, who invested in Mr. Posen's brand in 2004. Mr. Posen would often appear in white tie or a top hat, lending an air of nuttiness that was heightened by his more recent design influences: Shakers, intergalactic rock goddesses, Lewis Carroll meets Paloma Picasso.
 ''I am a Florenz Ziegfeld fanatic,'' Mr. Posen said. ''I love a spectacle, but I saw it as social commentary. I think my level of sophistication was a little higher than most people's. I saw an abstraction to the whole media frenzy of it. But at the end of the day, that's all that people felt, I think, and they didn't really look at the clothing.''
 Last September, however, Mr. Posen decided to change his presentations in a way that was interpreted by fashion insiders as a sign of retreat. He switched from the big nighttime shows to a small one at 9 a.m. Glenda Bailey did not attend that show, but a spokeswoman for Harper's Bazaar said the magazine had always supported him.
 There were other setbacks. A fragrance license with Selective Beauty that had been in development for two years, with a bottle designed by Fabien Baron, was canceled shortly before the company merged with another perfumer. Plans for Zac Posen stores in Paris and New York were postponed. And the investors who backed Mr. Combs, the Yucaipa Companies, began to impose tighter financial restraints on the company, Mr. Posen said, though he declined to be more specific.
 Susan Posen, his mother and the chief executive of the company, said that the business, while not yet profitable, had always been operated with the bottom line in mind. The expense of putting on such lavish shows, for example, was balanced by sponsorship from other companies. She would not disclose the company's sales, but Hoover's Inc. reported sales of $3.3 million for 2007. Others have estimated sales to be as high as $10 million. 
 But sales declined last year by a double-digit percentage, and the company's fast growth prior to the recession made it look to luxury experts like the kind of business most vulnerable in a downturn.
 ''It's more difficult for them right now than for an established, mature brand, or for an emerging designer who has a small business and a small, but manageable, overhead,'' said Robert Burke, a luxury consultant.
 Mr. Posen, meanwhile, is making do. When interviewed again this week, he was taking a break from draping dresses inside a tent set up in the middle of his showroom. Asked how sure he felt about the business now, he said, ''I am 110 percent, 200 percent confident and determined.''
 Editors who have seen his new lines for Saks and Target have raved about each. He plans to show his fall collection during Fashion Week, at 9 a.m. on Feb. 15, in a more restrained way.
 The reason is not only financial, he said.
 Mr. Posen wants the show to be about the clothes, not the designer.

HEADLINE: Officials Say Afghan Fight, Long Rumored, Is Coming

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND; Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington, and an employee of The New York Times from Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
NATO and the Afghan military are about to launch their biggest joint offensive of the war, and they appear to be making sure the Taliban know they are coming. 
 On Wednesday, spokesmen for the Afghan Defense Ministry and for the NATO forces announced at a news conference that an offensive involving thousands of troops would begin ''in the near future,'' and while they did not confirm the place, they also did not dispute widespread speculation that the target was the Taliban-held town of Marja.
 The deliberate publicizing of the offensive -- with news conferences, press releases and public pronouncements -- is relatively unusual for the military. There could be several strategic benefits -- and risks. If Taliban were to withdraw in advance of the offensive and civilians had ample warning, there could be fewer military and civilian casualties. 
 ''In some cases it may make sense, with a population-centered strategy, to give an awareness where U.S. and Afghan forces are going, and give an opportunity for Taliban and insurgent forces to clear out,'' said Seth Jones, a RAND Corporation senior political scientist who specializes in Afghanistan. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the American military commander in Afghanistan, has emphasized a counterinsurgency strategy that focuses on reducing civilian casualties and convincing the local population that the Americans and NATO can protect them. 
 Afghan military officials and Marja residents say that the area has been heavily leafleted to warn civilians that an offensive is coming. 
 But forewarning also gives the Taliban an opportunity to escape and regroup elsewhere, as insurgents in Iraq did after the 2004 American Marine assault on Falluja. That assault was also widely expected, and the timing generally known within days. Already, Mr. Jones said, there have been reports of Taliban militants filtering out of Marja. Alternatively, the Taliban could fortify their defenses and plant explosives around the area. 
 The imminent offensive was first announced in a press release from the Pentagon on Monday, and, unusually, the name of the campaign was disclosed: Operation Moshtarak, which means Joint Operation in Dari. 
 While reporters embedded with American units in southern Afghanistan have been told not to mention the target of the offensive in their dispatches, or in e-mail or phone calls, even Taliban commanders have said they expect their Marja stronghold to be attacked soon. 
 For months, the town has been under complete Taliban control, and more than a thousand Taliban reportedly took refuge there beginning last summer, as United States Marines stepped up the pressure in Helmand Province. Located in the opium poppy-growing belt, Marja also is close to the strategically important provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, and has been a staging area for suicide attacks and other bombings. 
 A local Taliban commander in Marja reached by cellphone said they were aware that the town was the target, and he sought to signal that they would not be intimidated. ''We will definitely defend Marja,'' said the commander, who goes by the name Ishaq. ''It's the only place left for us. We have all of our fighters assembled here to fight against Afghan and foreign forces.''
 ''We know this operation will be much bigger than previous operations,'' Mr. Ishaq said. ''We are determined to fight until the last drop of our blood.'' 
 At the news conference on Wednesday, Brig. Gen. Zahir Azimi, spokesman for Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense, said the offensive would start ''in the near future'' in southern Afghanistan. Brig. Gen. Eric Tremblay, the spokesman for NATO forces here, was more specific, saying it would be in central Helmand Province. ''There will be at least a thousand Afghan National Police, thousands of Afghan National Army soldiers and many thousands of ISAF troops,'' General Azimi said, using the acronym for the International Security Assistance Force.
 Since summer, international forces led by the United States Marines have been systematically clearing the Helmand River valley, and in December their Operation Cobra's Anger forced Taliban fighters out of the town of Now Zad, leaving Marja as the last town under Taliban control.
 ''It's no secret we're going there,'' the Marine commander in Helmand, Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson, said in an interview with Reuters and CNN in December. ''There's an inevitability that there's a date with destiny with Marja, and we're moving toward that.'' 
 At the bus station in Lashkar Gah on Wednesday, Marja residents said the offensive had been expected since leaflets were dropped from helicopters beginning about four months ago. The leaflets warned residents to stay off the streets after 9 p.m. and to stay away from windows once an offensive started.
 Ahmed Shah, a 53-year-old driver, said that Taliban fighters had been increasing their numbers in Marja in recent days and residents expected an attack soon, although they did not know when. ''Their activities are visible in the city and it seems they are preparing for face-to-face fighting with the government and international forces.'' 
 ''We know about the operation but we don't know how big and how powerful it will be,'' said Azizullah, 35, a shopkeeper from Marja, who uses only one name. ''It seems it will be a major operation because compared to the previous time, this time there's too much preparation for this operation on both sides.'' 
 Both Mr. Azizullah and Mr. Shah said they were hopeful that Afghan government and international forces would stay in Marja, rather than pulling out after a short time, as happened the last time the coalition took Marja, in May 2009. 
 ''There will be a big clearance operation and we will separate the civilian population from the insurgents,'' General Azimi said. ''As I've said many times before, we will have a bloody summer ahead.''
 General Tremblay said there was no intention of leaving the area after the offensive. Government and civilian reconstruction efforts will follow closely behind the military campaign, he said. 
 General Azimi said the Afghan military would be bringing troops in from many parts of the country for the offensive. In addition, American troop strength has doubled in the course of the past six months, making it easier to remain in force in areas that are cleared of Taliban. 
 He said previous efforts to clear the Taliban from areas in Helmand Province faltered because there were insufficient troops to stay permanently.

HEADLINE: New Theater: Lincoln Center Raises the Roof

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
In the early 1960s Hugh Hardy worked as an assistant to Jo Mielziner, the theatrical designer. Mr. Mielziner was collaborating with Eero Saarinen on the design of the Vivian Beaumont Theater for the new Lincoln Center, and part of Mr. Hardy's job was to mediate between his boss and the great architect.
 ''It was the most exciting thing that ever happened to me,'' Mr. Hardy said of the exposure to Saarinen. ''In fact, as a result I realized I really wanted to be an architect. I had a sort of religious conversion.''
 Nearly half a century later Mr. Hardy, 77, now a high-profile architect himself, is again working on the Beaumont, only this time without the involvement of Saarinen the Modernist master. His design for an addition to the building -- a new black box theater that will be perched on the roof of the Beaumont Theater with a terrace overlooking Lincoln Center -- is to be unveiled Thursday. 
 Last year preservationists warned against messing with Saarinen's original building, and with the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, designed by Gordon Bunshaft, that abuts it. 
 Andrew S. Dolkart, the director of Columbia University's historic preservation program, said in June that the new theater would amount to a ''big visible box on the roof of the building, which has the sense of floating now.''
 But the project has made it through the public approval process, including a nod from the Landmarks Preservation Commission (which has only an advisory role, since Lincoln Center is not landmarked). ''We thought its form and planned use of modern materials would harmonize with the Saarinen design and the building typology,'' said Elisabeth de Bourbon, the commission's spokeswoman.
 In an interview at Lincoln Center on Tuesday, Mr. Hardy argued that his addition is set well back and will not be visible from the plaza by the reflecting pool in front of the Beaumont. He also described his design as understated and in keeping with Saarinen's original vocabulary. 
 ''I didn't think it was appropriate to stamp myself all over it,'' Mr. Hardy said. ''I don't think it obscures what Eero was up to. It's very gentle, and it should be. Eero ought to win.''
 The new theater's programming, called LCT3, will feature the work of emerging playwrights, directors and designers, and will be aimed at new audiences, with every ticket priced at $20. It has been a long time coming -- Andre Bishop, Lincoln Center Theater's artistic director, has wanted a black box space since he came to Lincoln Center Theater in 1992. He shares the view, he said in an interview in his office, of young writers who are ''bored with these endless rounds of readings and workshops. They want a production.''
 ''It was a great dream of mine,'' he said, adding, ''Fan every talented flame.''
 LCT3 already exists as a program; Lincoln Center Theater has been renting the Duke Theater on West 42nd Street in Manhattan for performances since 2008. ''We started it before we built it,'' Mr. Bishop said. The theater company initially considered renovating a loft to create a kind of downtown branch. But there was a general feeling that the new theater should be on the main campus, Mr. Bishop said. Both artists and administrators felt it was important ''that it not be way off on west something-or-other street, not be a stepchild,'' he said.
 The project coincides with Lincoln Center's larger redevelopment project, currently under way, that aims to make the campus feel more open and welcoming. So far $37.5 million of the projected $41 million construction cost for the theater has been raised, most of it internally, ''from a very willing'' board, said Linda LeRoy Janklow, the chairwoman emeritus of Lincoln Center Theater. Leonard Tow, a trustee, donated $7.5 million, and the new auditorium will be named for his wife, Claire. ''All the theaters in this complex will be named after these theater-loving women,'' Mr. Bishop said. In addition to the Vivian Beaumont, which seats 1,060, Lincoln Center Theater includes the Mitzi E. Newhouse, which seats 299. 
 Lincoln Center Theater's annual operating budget of $32 million is expected to increase by between $1 million and $2 million a year as a result of the addition. 
 Asked whether he was concerned about being able to carry these higher costs, Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, said: ''Worrying is part of the game. But you also trust that what you're doing has merit.''
 Despite the economic downturn, Ms. Janklow said, the project was never in question -- only the timing. ''Nobody every doubted that we wanted to do it,'' she said. ''There was a question of when to do it.'' 
 Construction is scheduled to begin in March, with a completion date of late 2011 or early 2012. (''We're not breaking ground, we're breaking the roof,'' Mr. Gersten said.) A spokesman for Lincoln Center Theater said performances in the Beaumont and Newhouse auditoriums would not be interrupted. 
 The new theater will seat 131 in a fixed configuration -- no thrust stage or moveable seats. Mr. Hardy has surrounded the seats with a curved wood enclosure. The addition as a whole, at 23,000 square feet, will include a lounge, rehearsal space, dressing rooms and offices. The second level is to have a green roof and the terrace. 
 To accommodate an elevator, Lincoln Center Theater will borrow stack space from Bunshaft's library; in return, Lincoln Center Theater is providing high-density compact shelving for storage.
 Mr. Hardy described the building as ''informal,'' with concrete trusses, textured glass that becomes translucent and an aluminum louver system.
 ''We wanted to continue the same geometry because it comes from the structure of the building,'' he said. ''It's a new kind of structure on top of the old one, but doing the same stuff.'' 
 Mr. Bishop said he did not want a fancy building; he wanted a simple theater, with built-in limitations. ''There's no way we can overproduce in this space,'' he said.
 The new theater should serve as a recruitment tool and training ground for Lincoln Center Theater, and a place for it to test talent that may eventually feed all its large stage productions. ''This is our way of finding writers and directors and designers to come here and work here on all our stages,'' Mr. Bishop said. ''The only way for theater to survive is to constantly renew itself.''

HEADLINE: A Writer By Accident Whose Course Is Deliberate

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
Don DeLillo, whose new novel, ''Point Omega,'' came out on Tuesday, is not exactly a Pynchonesque recluse. He travels, sees friends, gives readings occasionally. People know what he looks like: a slight, reserved man, now going gray, with an intense, serious expression. ''I only smile when I'm alone,'' he said recently, not smiling.
 But Mr. DeLillo, famous for novels about dread, violence, the dehumanizing effects of technology and the invasion of popular culture into private lives, shuns publicity. Though he has become a cult writer of sorts -- particularly admired by readers who have found novels like ''Players,'' from 1977, about Wall Street brokers who get mixed up in a terrorist plot, almost eerily prophetic -- he is uncomfortable with cultism. ''I was called a cult writer in the 70's, when that meant that very few people were reading me,'' he likes to say. 
 He is almost equally uncomfortable with his commercial success, which began after the publication of ''White Noise,'' his 1985 novel about Jack Gladney, a professor of Hitler studies. Mr. DeLillo doesn't teach or appear on panels or turn up at big literary gatherings, and he seldom gives interviews. He doesn't use e-mail, because he says it ''encourages communication I'd just as soon not have.'' 
 Though he considers himself a city person, and still speaks with a trace of a Bronx accent, Mr. DeLillo and his wife live quietly, almost invisibly, in a Westchester suburb, where he writes in an upstairs room on an Underwood manual typewriter he bought secondhand in 1975. On a shelf nearby are a pair of baseballs signed by Bobby Thomson, whose 1951 pennant-winning home run is the subject of the famous set piece that begins Mr. DeLillo's novel ''Underworld.''
 Unlike ''Underworld,'' a sprawling, near-epic of a book, ''Point Omega,'' like most of Mr. DeLillo's recent work, is brief, spare and concentrated, a mere 117 pages. There are only three main characters, and their conversations seldom last for more than a couple of sentences. Writing in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani said that ''instead of the jazzy, vernacular, darkly humorous language he employed to such galvanic effect in 'White Noise' and 'Underworld,' '' Mr. DeLillo had chosen to use ''spare, etiolated, almost Beckettian prose.'' 
 Mr. DeLillo got the idea for the book, he said recently, in the summer of 2006, when, wandering through the Museum of Modern Art, he happened upon Douglas Gordon's ''24 Hour Psycho,'' a video installation that consists of the Alfred Hitchcock movie ''Psycho'' slowed down to two frames a second so that it lasts for an entire day instead of the original hour and a half or so. ''I went back four times, and by the third time I knew this was something I had to write about,'' he said, adding, ''Most of the time I was the only one there except for a guard, and the few people who came in left quite hastily.'' 
 The slowness of the film, and the way it caused him to notice things he might otherwise have missed, appealed to him, Mr. DeLillo said: ''The idea of time and motion and the question of what we see, what we miss when we look at things in a conventional manner -- all that seemed very inviting to me to think about.''
 So he wrote a scene, now the novel's prologue, in which two unnamed characters, an older man and a younger one, visit ''24 Hour Psycho,'' and he later added an epilogue set in the same gallery. The action of the book takes place in between those brackets, and Mr. DeLillo said it didn't become clear to him until he realized who those two unnamed characters were: Jim Finley, a young filmmaker (whose only previous work is a 57-minute compilation of clips from Jerry Lewis telethons), and Richard Elster, a 73-year-old conservative intellectual still smarting from an unhappy stint at the Pentagon helping to plan the Iraq war. Finley wants to make a movie about Elster and has followed him to the Arizona desert, where the older man has gone to chill out and to exchange his ordinary sense of time for a longer, more existential view. Eventually Elster begins to sound a little like the French philosopher Teilhard de Chardin, imagining an omega point beyond consciousness and human evolution.
 The novel too slows down, in sentences that are spare and condensed, without much metaphorical decoration, but Mr. DeLillo was reluctant to take much credit for that. ''I feel that a novel tells you what it wants to be,'' he said. ''I know that sounds pretentious. But that's the sense I have. I felt I was discovering rather than inventing.'' 
 A famously gifted elaborator, Mr. DeLillo still said about this book: ''I did tell myself I can't elaborate here, though at certain points I might have enjoyed that. It's really the purest sort of impulse -- a question of what the novel seems to want -- and this novel demanded economy.''
 So have most of Mr. DeLillo's novels ever since ''Underworld.'' ''The Body Artist'' (2001) is barely longer than ''Point Omega'' and opens with a breakfast scene that is practically a still life. For most of its 224 pages ''Cosmopolis'' (2003) is about a man stuck in traffic. But Mr. DeLillo said that the spareness and near-abstractness of those books came more from the novels themselves than from any conscious decision on his part. ''I'm not philosophically opposed to another big book,'' he said. ''I wish I could say I'm working on one, but I'm not.'' 
 He added, ''The last two or three novels are more philosophical, for better or worse, and more interested in the subject of time,'' and he admitted that might have to do with his own age. Mr. DeLillo is 73 now and considers himself a late bloomer. He didn't publish his first novel until he was 35, after quitting a job in advertising and after what he calls ''a golden age of reading,'' in which he would ''consume fiction as if it were breakfast cereal.''
 Asked why his first book took him so long, he answered: ''I don't have any explanation for that. All I know is that one day I said to myself, 'I think I'm a writer.' I started making sentences I didn't know I was capable of.'' 
 ''A writer changes as he gets older,'' he went on, ''but he still feels he's writing with absolute naturalness when in fact that naturalness is not the same as what it was 15 years ago.'' He added: ''I guess I'm slightly aware that the last few books have been a little different, but I try not to think about that too much. I wouldn't know how to talk about it.''

HEADLINE: Scattered Emigres It Once Shunned Are Lifeline for Haiti

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN. 
Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Since leaving Haiti in 1974 and becoming a successful engineer here, Fritz Armand has often felt that his skills were unwelcome in his native country.
 His efforts to build a desalination facility and a portable power plant in Haiti failed in part, he says, because of antipathy toward expatriates. He has been called ''diaspore,'' an insulting term. Under Haitian law, when he became an American citizen, he automatically ''renounced'' his birthplace. 
 For years, educated emigres like Mr. Armand, from Miami to Montreal, have tried hard to play a more vital role in Haiti's development, with little success. 
 But the earthquake has suddenly changed all that, reducing old hostilities to rubble. Depleted of leadership and talent, the Haitian government -- once known for ejecting elected officials who held a United States passport -- is begging its own for aid, and the Haitian-born have responded en masse. 
 ''The diaspora must organize to help us,'' Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said last week at a conference in Montreal. ''I have no alternative. They have to be involved in Haiti; they have to be engaged.''
 He need not have asked. Groups like the Haitian American Nurses Association, based in Miami, and the Haitian League in New Jersey have sent dozens of Creole-speaking doctors and nurses to help. In Canada, hundreds of Haitians who work for the government are pushing for a furlough program to allow them to help back home. 
 At the request of diaspora leaders, the Organization of American States will convene an international gathering of Haitian groups next month to map out plans for reconstruction and to ensure that the Haitian diaspora is included, not only by the government but also by contractors and nongovernmental organizations.
 For his part, Mr. Armand, 53, the former director of public works for Opa-Locka, Fla., has spent contented days poring over uniform business codes and inspecting new types of construction materials, preparing to go with others in the Haitian-American Association of Engineers and Scientists to help inspect bridges and build sanitation systems for camps. This time, he will be in Haiti at the invitation of the minister of public works.
 ''Now that they have no choice but to let us in, that will allow them to see: They're not all that bad,'' Mr. Armand said. ''They're not coming to take my job. They're coming to help.''
 Still, the Haitian government's new attitude has not erased all skepticism. Some in the diaspora say they have been kept at bay by fears that they would usurp jobs or expose corruption, while others say the negative sentiment has been a political tool, fanned for cynical ends. Whatever the reason, it did not ease the hurt when Haiti welcomed the billions of dollars that emigres sent home but rebuffed their expertise. 
 To prove Haiti wants more than just money from its diaspora, said Chalmers Larose, a Haitian-born political science professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal, the government must follow up with policy changes. 
 ''If I want to go to Haiti, I can go, but I would have to be a tourist,'' Professor Larose said. ''There is no agency to channel my expertise.''
 The Haitian diaspora is estimated to be at least two million strong, with more than half a million Haitian-born people in the United States alone, heavily concentrated in South Florida and Brooklyn. In 2008, Haitians around the world sent at least $1.3 billion to Haiti, far more than the amount of foreign aid the country received, according to the World Bank. 
 While many Haitian expatriates, especially the illegal immigrants, remain poor, there is a robust elite of businessmen and professionals who view themselves as a recovering Haiti's best hope.
 ''There are more Haitian doctors here than there are in Haiti,'' said Jean-Robert Lafortune, the executive director of the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition in Miami, who said the earthquake was a chance for new cooperative spirit to take hold. 
 Gerard Alphonse Ferere, a retired professor living in Boca Raton, Fla., said antipathy toward Haitians who left was limited to a small segment of the political and economic elite. Still, Mr. Ferere said, that small group can be pernicious. 
 Mr. Ferere was forced into exile with his wife in 1963, under threat of execution by the Duvaliers, who brutally ruled the country from the 1950s to the '80s. When he returned after Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted in 1986, he found that some questioned his loyalty.
 ''They said: 'You are not Haitian anymore. We don't want you. Where were you?' '' Mr. Ferere recalled. ''So I have been victimized twice.''
 Mr. Ferere said the questioners were connected with the Duvalier government and wanted to discredit its opponents. 
 On an economic and political level, the diaspora could be threatening, said Harry Casimir, 30, a Haitian-born businessman who opened an information technology business there just before the earthquake.
 ''Once the elites have money and power,'' Mr. Casimir said, ''they're scared of people like me, the younger generation and so on. Because we travel around the world and see how other governments function, and obviously most countries are not corrupt like Haiti.''
 But several expatriates acknowledged that some of the fault might lie in a certain swagger on their own part.
 ''People in the diaspora may be coming with that complex of superiority, where they think, We know better; we can do it better,'' said the Rev. Reginald Jean-Mary, pastor of Notre Dame d'Haiti in the Little Haiti section of Miami. 
 Yet Father Jean-Mary provoked murmurs of excitement Sunday at a packed high Mass here, when he proclaimed, ''This is the moment to suspend politics, because we have had enough politics in Haiti.'' 
 He added, ''It's time to open Haiti to the diaspora.''
 Recently, countries like Mexico and Colombia have extended more rights, like the right to vote, to their expatriates, said Alex Stepick, a professor of global and social cultural studies at Florida International University. Even before the earthquake, Haiti had been inching in that direction, with groups like the Haitian Diaspora Unity Congress, meeting for its second time last year to discuss issues like health care, economic development and education. 
 Other signs of change came after President Bill Clinton's appointment last May as the United Nations special envoy to Haiti. Mr. Clinton's recruitment of large investors galvanized Haitian-born entrepreneurs. And last August, the United States Agency for International Development started a pilot program to provide a two-to-one match for investments by those in the Haitian diaspora in certain industries.
 Most significant to many emigres, a constitutional amendment that would have given them the right to vote and opened the door for them to run for office in Haiti had seemed headed for approval when the quake struck.
 That agenda item is now on the back burner because, for now, nothing is more compelling than the chance to help rebuild the country -- perhaps, if Mr. Armand has any say, with lightweight fiber-reinforced concrete and inexpensive solar-powered lights. 
 ''We do our work here,'' Mr. Armand said of his adopted land. ''But, really, our heart is in Haiti.''

HEADLINE: Plenty of Nuts for Sale, but the Roasters Are Vanishing

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
''We Are Nuts About Nuts,'' the awning proclaims, as the classic stainless-steel roaster spins in the window, churning out seven-pound batches of hot almonds, cashews and pistachios, up to 10 times a day. Beyond the glass, bins of macadamias, raisins and pumpkin seeds nestle amid containers of dried fruit, store-made snack mixes and black licorice. 
 There are plenty of places to buy nuts in Manhattan, from Whole Foods to CVS to the occasional subway platform. But if you want them fresh, perhaps even still warm, from the roaster, SP's Nuts and Candy may well be your only option. 
 Once upon a time, shops like this were a staple of city life, quick stops for a cheap, salty snack and a whiff of nuttiness. Today, SP's owner, Michael Yeo, is keeping alive a New York tradition that has all but vanished over the past several decades, one he simply happened into. 
 He explained that in 1996, when he bought the business on Church Street in Lower Manhattan, it came with a roaster, and now he was simply stuck with it. 
 ''My customers know that I roast here, so I cannot stop,'' he said, laughing. ''If I do -- big trouble.''
 The nut shops, which often sold sweets and, in the summer, ice cream to keep sales up, date back to an era in New York when specialty stores and niche shopping districts -- one even for pickles -- were the norm. 
 ''If you wanted to buy deli, you went to a deli shop; if you wanted to buy nuts, you went to a candy shop,'' said Bentzy Klein, owner of Bentzy's Brokerage, a nut and dried fruit supplier in Borough Park, Brooklyn. ''Now you could go into Fairway,'' he continued, ''and you could buy everything that you need, and they have top of the line.'' 
 Much of the business has also moved online and is geared toward gift baskets, he said. ''In the Jewish neighborhoods, yes, you still have these people that will go in before Shabbos and buy up a bunch of stuff because they're sitting home and they're going to nosh on everything,'' he said. ''But most of the business is gifts.''
 No one seems to monitor the comings and goings of nut shops, and the State Department of Agriculture and Markets, which regulates them, does not issue special permits for those who roast. But what evidence there is suggests they are indeed a dying breed. 
 Of the 38 Manhattan retail food operations licensed with the word ''nut'' in the company name, only 7 bear any resemblance to the nut sellers of yore, and none of them roast. Most are outposts of World of Nuts and Ice Cream, a chain of stores where nuts are often overshadowed by candy and toys.
 An Israeli store on Hester Street that some customers remember is long closed; contributors to food blogs rue the loss of Broadway Nuts, near 80th Street. Candy World in TriBeCa, which roasted nuts for its confections, has gone out of business, too.
 And Economy Candy, a Lower East Side institution since 1937, still sells nuts along with its dried fruit and sweets, but no longer roasts. ''It just became too much, with the oils and the smells and the Fire Department coming to inspect every week,'' said Jerry Cohen, the owner. ''You need this permit, that permit -- they don't let you live.''
 Rocco D'Amato, who owns Bazzini, one of the largest import and wholesale nut operations in the city, blamed the decline on rising real estate costs, migration to the suburbs -- where nuts can be sold from inexpensive mall kiosks -- and competition from supermarkets and drugstores, which carry a wide array of high-quality snacks.
 ''You have nuts now being packaged in very sophisticated, gorgeous packages by the Europeans, then you move the customer base out into suburbia, then you add in the dramatic increase in rent, and you have the catastrophe that you have now,'' Mr. D'Amato said. 
 The business is so challenging that he and his wife, Electra, have left retail entirely. Last Friday, they closed the food market and cafe they ran for years in TriBeCa.
 William Black may have seen it coming in the early 1930s when he converted his 18 Chock full o' Nuts stores into coffee shops. Deep in the clutches of the Great Depression, buying shelled nuts seemed too much of a frivolous luxury, said Arthur Schwartz, who wrote ''Arthur Schwartz's New York City Food: An Opinionated History and More Than 100 Legendary Recipes.''
 ''I'm not old enough to remember the heyday of this,'' Mr. Schwartz, 62, said. ''But there used to be a man dressed up as a peanut outside of a nut store in Times Square,'' he added, referring to the Planters nut shop at 1560 Broadway, which he and his family would visit from Brooklyn before it closed around 1960. 
 There was also a cluster of Syrian nut purveyors around the Washington Market, once the city's main food bazaar, and which closed to make way for the World Trade Center, said Nancy Ralph, director of the NY Food Museum. Those shops, which sell all kinds of provisions, have migrated to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, she said.
 Yet Mr. Yeo's roaster continues to turn on Church Street between Chambers and Reade, drawing customers so loyal that some come in every day, while others continue to shop there after they no longer work in the neighborhood. He does not eat the nuts himself. When he was growing up in Korea, nuts and dried fruit were not popular, and he never developed the snack habit. 
 He used to run a laundry business on Staten Island, where he lives, but took a year off work after the birth of his son, now 14. Then he saw an ad in a Korean-language paper for the nut shop, which he said first opened in 1978.
 ''Literally I didn't have any idea there were this many different kinds of nuts, this many kinds of candy,'' he said. But he learned in about two months from the previous owner. ''As an immigrant, whatever I start, I was ready to do my best to survive.'' 
 He would like to open another branch, he said, but his daughter, 12, needs extra care because she has lissencephaly, a rare brain disorder, and he would not have the time to manage it. 
 So customers like B J Williamson will continue to content themselves with this store, as she has for about 10 years, ''because the nuts are good and they're nice people,'' she said, packing her bag of slivered almonds, macadamia nuts and licorice into her shopping cart. 
 Lamenting the loss of mom-and-pop stores like Mr. Yeo's in New York, she added, ''They're just taking all the good things away and bringing in the gentrified stores -- it's just horrible.''

HEADLINE: With Less to Tax, State's Budget Gap Gets Bigger After Wall Street Bonuses Shrink

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
New York State officials staring at holes in the budget this time of year generally have had a trusty cushion to fall back on: a mattress stuffed full of Wall Street bonus money.
 But this year is what is known in business schools as an outlier. The tide of negative sentiment toward the big banks has thrown the normal flow and structure of pay on Wall Street out of whack. The taxes on those bonuses, in turn, are falling well short of expectations, widening the state's budget deficit by the day.
 On Wednesday, the state's Budget Division said that the deficit for the next fiscal year, which will start April 1, was already $750 million larger than it appeared when Gov. David A. Paterson laid out his proposed budget two weeks ago. 
 The state had expected to collect $1 billion to $1.5 billion in taxes on Wall Street pay in the last two weeks of January, said Robert L. Megna, the budget director. But at the end of the month, tax revenue was about $1 billion shy of what had been projected, Mr. Megna said.
 ''We know that big guys typically pay us at the end of January,'' Mr. Megna said, referring to large banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. ''Last week, after the budget came out, they didn't pay us.''
 One reason for the shortfall is that the banks have been cowed by public outrage and political rhetoric into cutting back sharply on the amount of cash they pay as bonuses. Citigroup, for example, capped cash payouts at $100,000 this year, a fraction of the millions some top producers and senior executives have taken home in the past. 
 Firms substituted restricted shares of stock for some of the cash they would have paid. In many cases, those shares cannot be sold for a year or more, leaving recipients to decide whether to pay taxes on them now or later. Most will opt for later, Mr. Megna said.
 The banks are ''paying in stock, and they're deferring income,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, whose members include the biggest banks. ''They're making up all sorts of ways to keep talent, none of which are as good for the city and state. The pressure to hold back cash payments to New York taxpayers just means other taxpayers are going to end up paying the bill.''
 Mr. Megna estimated that the shifting mix of cash and stock accounts for about half the tax shortfall so far. The other half he attributed to changes in the timing of bonus payouts. Some of the biggest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, became bank holding companies during the financial crisis and changed their fiscal years to end Dec. 31 instead of Nov. 30. Those calendar revisions resulted in bonuses being paid a month later.
 By April, the state should collect about half the taxes on Wall Street pay that did not materialize in January, Mr. Megna said. The rest may not arrive for another year or two, if ever, he said.
 But Mr. Megna acknowledged that he was guessing, something that state budget directors are loath to do. ''There's a volatility cost, there's an uncertainty cost that makes it difficult to plan,'' he said.
 The cutback in cash bonuses also will have a reverse ripple effect, he said. Bonus recipients are likely to spend less of their payouts immediately, reducing sales and real estate tax revenue and hurting merchants who rely on their business.
 On Wednesday, a Manhattan restaurant that caters to bankers and businessmen, Smith & Wollensky, ran a tongue-in-cheek newspaper ad offering to accept shares of stock as payment for steaks. The restaurant's founder, Alan Stillman, said business had been hurt by the financial crisis.
 The switch from cash to stock in bonuses could have a ''catastrophic'' effect on the local economy, the ad said, leaving ''legions of real estate brokers, personal shoppers and pet psychiatrists unemployed and massive amounts of steak and lobster uneaten.''

HEADLINE: Yale, With $150 Million Deficit, Plans Staff and Research Cuts

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Yale University announced on Wednesday that it planned a number of steps to close a remaining $150 million budget gap, including cutting staff, freezing salaries for deans and officers, reducing the number of graduate students -- even turning down all thermostats to 68 degrees. 
 In a memo to the faculty and staff, Richard C. Levin, Yale's president, and Peter Salovey, its provost, said the measures were necessary because of the drop in the endowment to $16.3 billion last June from its peak of $22.9 billion in June 2008. 
 ''Actions taken last year eliminated more than half of the total deficit, but, as we communicated in the fall, a substantial gap of nearly $150 million remained as of last September,'' they wrote. ''This gap needs to be closed for the next and subsequent years.''
 The memo did not specify how many staff positions would be eliminated. Last year, 100 employees, out of a work force of 9,200, were laid off because of similar financial pressures, and several hundred more positions were eliminated through attrition, said Tom Conroy, a Yale spokesman. Those cuts did not affect faculty positions; nor will the current round.
 Laura Smith, president of Local 34 of the Federation of University Employees, which represents 3,400 clerical and technical workers at Yale, said the union would try to blunt the impact of any cuts on its members. ''It's disappointing over all that the university feels it has to do more cuts,'' she said, noting that the union and Yale had reached agreement last April on a new contract with strong job security, eight months ahead of schedule. 
 The announcement said that support from the provost for a number of research and other programs would be ''reduced but not eliminated.'' In addition, those earning more than $83,000 and who are on the Yale Health Plan will have to start paying for part of their coverage. The reduction in new graduate students, expected to be 10 to 15 percent, would save money, as most receive full tuition and a stipend.
 Mr. Conroy said that Yale could not simply dip into its endowment. ''First, the endowment is largely restricted to the purposes designated by donors,'' he said in a statement. ''Second, you would simply be delaying the need to reduce expenditures to future years, because the endowment's annual payout would be lower in the future if even more of it were spent now.''
 Other elite universities in the New York region and across the nation have also had layoffs since the economic downturn. 
 At Cornell University, about 150 staff members were laid off through November, and another 432 employees took an early-retirement incentive. But 34 of the laid-off workers have been rehired for other jobs, said Simeon Moss, a Cornell spokesman.
 At Princeton, a total of 43 positions were eliminated last fall as part of a broad initiative to reduce the operating budget by $170 million over two years. In addition, 145 employees took early retirement.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Help Banks in Distressed Areas

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department will invest up to $1 billion from the federal bank bailout fund in small banks and credit unions that make loans to small businesses in some of the communities most ravaged by the economic downturn, officials announced on Wednesday.
 About 210 institutions will be eligible for low-cost capital under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, created in 2008 to buy assets from troubled banks, Treasury officials said. The eligible institutions are 60 banks and thrifts with a total of $21 billion in assets and 150 credit unions with a combined $5 billion in assets. 
 They are among 834 certified by the Treasury as community development financial institutions, meaning that they make at least 60 percent of their small-business lending in low- and moderate-income areas. Many of the institutions are nonprofits. 
 The Obama administration first announced the program on Oct. 21. Banks will have to pay only 2 percent on the Treasury's capital investments, compared with the 5 percent rate for large banks in the bailout program. (The rate will increase to 9 percent after eight years, compared to five years for large banks taking part in the program.)
 But only 26 small banks have signed up since then, prompting Treasury officials to make the program more accessible. 
 Two changes emerging from that effort were announced Wednesday. The program will allow banks to apply for Treasury investments of up to 5 percent of their risk-weighted assets, up from 2 percent in the original announcement. A similar cap will apply to credit unions. 
 And institutions that would not otherwise have gotten regulatory approval, a requirement of the initial program, will now be eligible if they secure matching private investments. 
 The latter provision is ''a very important protection for taxpayers,'' said Gene Sperling, a counselor to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. ''No dollar of taxpayer money will go out unless someone in the private sector is, dollar for dollar, just as committed to the future viability of that bank.'' 
 Eligible banks applauded the changes. Ellen Seidman, executive vice president of ShoreBank, which began in 1973 on the South Side of Chicago and has been a model for similar efforts, said her bank would probably apply to the program. The bank has fallen on hard times; last summer, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation required ShoreBank to revisit its portfolio, change its management and shore up reserves and asset quality. 
 ''We've been lending in the toughest parts of Chicago, Cleveland and Detroit, through thick and thin when nobody else was there, helping borrowers whom other banks weren't ready to work with,'' Ms. Seidman said in a phone interview. ''Until this recent crisis, we had been quite resilient and consistently profitable.''
 Mr. Geithner met Wednesday with leading community bankers, including David C. Reiling of Sunrise Community Banks in Minneapolis and St. Paul; Deborah C. Wright of Carver Federal Savings Bank in New York; Dorothy Bridges of City First Bank of DC, in Washington; Luis Pastor of the Latino Community Credit Union in Durham, N.C.; Alden J. McDonald Jr. of Liberty Bank and Trust in New Orleans; Joseph Haskins Jr. of the Harbor Bank of Maryland, in Baltimore; and Deloris Sims of Legacy Bank in Milwaukee. 
 The program has similar aims as a separate, more ambitious proposal announced by President Obama in Nashua, N.H., on Tuesday, to use $30 billion from the bailout fund to create a Small Business Lending Fund. That proposal requires Congressional approval. 
 That proposal would apply to a much wider range of banks than the program aimed at community development financial institutions. 
 Treasury officials said they would make as much as $500 million to $1 billion available from the TARP program for the community development banks. 
 ''If everybody applied and asked for the maximum amount, it would be a little over $800 million,'' said Jeannine S. Jacokes, executive director of Community Development Bankers Association. ''I believe the vast majority of the community development banks will want to participate.'' 
 Ms. Jacokes's association represents 64 Treasury-certified community development banks. Most serve urban, low-income areas and have assets of $150 million to $200 million on average. ''They fund mom-and-pop businesses, nonprofit organizations that build affordable housing, and renovation of charter schools and community health care centers,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Defense Budget

 BODY:
The cold war has been nearly banished from the Pentagon's latest review of military challenges. The Quadrennial Defense Review, released this week, finally catches up with the current world, one where the United States confronts a host of different adversaries on a variety of different battlefields. 
 It acknowledges that while the United States remains the world's leading military power, it is much more dependent on allies to help maintain international stability. It places long overdue emphasis on preserving and rebuilding the overstretched, all-volunteer force. It recognizes the need to rebalance American forces to perform multiple new tasks and to finally jettison cold war weapons that are too expensive, over budget, underperforming or ill suited to today's missions. 
 The review and the accompanying 2011 defense budget request still fall short, particularly in their failure to address the security-related consequences of a world of deficits as far as the eye can see. The review talks about the need for future ''trade-offs'' but suggests that that is only a possibility when it must be a given. 
 President Obama is asking Congress for $708.3 billion in defense spending for fiscal year 2011. That includes a base budget of $549 billion (the growth rate, adjusted for inflation, is 2.3 percent over 2010, compared with 4 percent per year from 2000 to 2009) and $159 billion for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The White House is separately seeking another $33 billion for the 30,000 more troops being sent to Afghanistan.
 At a time when the country is fighting two wars, major savings are not likely to be possible. This Pentagon budget, like President Obama's last one, makes some tough choices -- but not enough. 
 On the positive side, the budget reflects the defense review's priorities by adding billions in new financing for helicopters, unmanned drones and special operations forces that are all crucial to the fight against extremists.
 It also calls for canceling some anachronistic or unnecessary programs. Defense Secretary Robert Gates boldly took on the lobbyists and their many allies in Congress last year and canceled the F-22 fighter jet, a cold war relic. We applaud his efforts to try -- once again -- to end production of the C-17 transport plane, which military planners say they have enough of, and an alternate engine for the F-35, which the planners say is redundant. 
 He could cut more. An estimated $26 billion can be saved by halting production of the troubled V-22 Osprey vertical lift aircraft and the hugely costly Virginia class submarine, slimming the still unproven missile defense program and refitting existing warships (not buying new ones) for Mr. Obama's new missile defense plan in Europe. 
 The budget rightly calls for improved medical care and support programs for soldiers and their families; all are under incredible strain after eight years of war. Over the long term, defense planners are worried about this country's ability to pay for the all-volunteer military, in part because the annual cost of health care (for retirees as well as active-duty personnel) has skyrocketed from $19 billion in 2001 to more than $50 billion in 2011. 
 Mr. Gates was right this week to raise the issue of unrealistically low annual health insurance premiums for military retirees (active-duty military do not pay for health care), saying they have not been increased (from $460 per family, $230 per individual) in 15 years. 
 Congress now gets to poke, prod and, we hope, seriously debate the budget and the defense review. It must start with another post-cold-war notion: The country cannot afford to write the Pentagon a blank check. And that means that Congress will have to spend less time listening to defense lobbyists and more time thinking about the country's real strategic needs.

HEADLINE: Colombian Paramilitaries' Successors Called a Threat

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
Criminal armies that emerged from the ashes of the Colombian government's attempt to disband paramilitary groups are spreading their reach across the country's economy while engaging in a broad range of rights abuses, including massacres, rapes and forced displacement, a human rights group said Wednesday. 
 A report by the group, Human Rights Watch, detailed the activities of the paramilitary successor groups, which feed off Colombia's cocaine trade. The drug trade remains lucrative despite Washington's channeling of more than $5 billion of security and antinarcotics aid to Colombia, making it a top recipient of United States aid outside the Middle East. 
 ''One major reason why combating these groups is not a priority is that it's hard for the current government to acknowledge that a significant part of its security policy is failing,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director for Human Rights Watch, speaking in Bogota, Colombia. 
 Seeking to influence the Obama administration's policies toward Colombia, the group recommended delaying ratification of a long-awaited trade deal until Colombia's government vigorously and effectively confronts the criminal groups, which succeeded paramilitaries formed by landowners decades ago to combat guerrillas. 
 President Obama said in his State of the Union address last week that he would like to strengthen trade ties with Colombia.
 The Human Rights Watch report comes at a delicate time for Colombia's president, Alvaro Uribe, who is keeping the country on edge as to whether he will seek a third term in May. In 2006, during his administration, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, a coalition of 37 paramilitary groups, officially demobilized, and Mr. Uribe has won support for lowering violence. But he has not secured a definitive victory against these flourishing new criminal armies, or the leftist guerrillas who have waged insurgencies that have lasted for decades. And murders connected to the paramilitaries' successors are surging once again in Medellin, a city where there had been a respite from such violence. 
 The report drew a sharp rebuke from Colombia's government. Defense Minister Gabriel Silva canceled a meeting with Mr. Vivanco on Wednesday and said in a statement that the report ''completely ignored the public security forces' efforts in combating these criminal groups.''
 The Human Rights Watch researchers based their findings on field studies in eight regions of Colombia, including more than 100 interviews with victims, other interviews with demobilized paramilitary combatants and meetings with diplomats, Colombian security experts and senior government and law enforcement officials.
 The report found that the successor groups and the guerrillas had forged drug-trafficking alliances in two areas of western Colombia, Cauca and Narino, where a private army, the Rastrojos, is working together with one of the main insurgent groups, the National Liberation Army, or E.L.N.
 In other places, the report said, private armies occasionally engage in counterinsurgency operations, particularly in areas where the largest insurgent group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, remains active. Maria McFarland, the report's author, said the threat posed by the successor groups was steadily growing, citing tolerance of the criminal armies by public security forces and big gaps in police presence in rural areas of Colombia. Nongovernmental groups estimate membership at about 10,200, compared with the estimate of 4,000 from Colombia's National Police. The new groups -- including Renacer (Rebirth); Colombian Revolutionary Popular Antiterrorist Army; and Nueva Generacion (New Generation) -- are often led by former midlevel paramilitary commanders. 
 While the new criminal armies lack the broad cohesion and explicit counterinsurgency mandate of their paramilitary forerunners, their tactics are chillingly similar. 
 As an example, the report detailed the story of Yimmy Jansasoy, a young member of a group that helps Afro-Colombian communities assert claims to their own land in Choco, a region of thick jungle that has been the focus of power struggles among successor groups. He described being kidnapped in 2008 by a group called Black Eagles. 
 ''On Sept. 3, I left to make some rounds and was abducted by four armed men,'' said Mr. Jansasoy. ''They put me in a truck, face down, with my hands tied behind my back. They intimidated me with a gun. They ordered me to give information about my co-workers and their families.''

HEADLINE: Lacking the Plaudits of 2006, the Fed Chief Takes the Oath Quietly This Time

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke stepped into the imposing two-story marble atrium at the Federal Reserve's headquarters and took the oath of office from his deputy. The president lauded Mr. Bernanke as ''an economist's economist'' who had ''earned the respect of the global financial community.'' A cabinet secretary, members of Congress and two former Fed chairmen looked on. 
 That was then. 
 This is now. Mr. Bernanke was sworn in Wednesday to a second four-year term as chairman of the central bank in a quiet ceremony that had none of the pomp and praise of four years ago.
 Back then, on Feb. 6, 2006, unemployment was 4.8 percent and the Fed had just raised its benchmark interest rate to 4.5 percent as it tried to slow the economy and prevent inflation. The Senate had confirmed Mr. Bernanke by acclaim. The Fed's institutional prestige was so high that George W. Bush paid a rare visit -- only the third president to do so. 
 Today, the unemployment rate is 10 percent, and the Fed has kept the federal funds rate, its main policy lever, near zero for more than a year as Mr. Bernanke and the bank have been criticized for contributing to the housing bubble and the financial collapse. 
 The Senate reconfirmed Mr. Bernanke Jan. 28 by the narrowest margin in the Fed's 96-year history, and only after lobbying by the White House.
 Neither President Obama nor any other top official attended Wednesday's ceremony, held in the same atrium in the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building, named for a former chairman. It was restricted to staff members, although Mr. Bernanke's wife, Anna, was present. 
 After the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, administered the oath, Mr. Bernanke told employees that he had begun his second term ''with considerable gratitude and not a little humility,'' according to a 717-word statement supplied by the Fed. 
 ''At the Federal Reserve and other agencies, the crisis revealed weaknesses and gaps in the regulation and supervision of financial institutions and financial markets,'' Mr. Bernanke said. The Fed, he said, was revamping how it conducts oversight and collaborating with Congress and financial authorities in other countries to reform banking regulations. 
 However, Mr. Bernanke also defended the Fed's autonomy, at a time when some critics in Congress have called for auditing its monetary policy. 
 ''Institutional independence brings with it fundamental obligations of transparency, responsiveness and accountability,'' Mr. Bernanke said, adding: ''It is essential that the public have the information it needs to understand and be assured of the integrity of all our operations, including all aspects of our balance sheet and our financial controls.'' 
 Earlier on Wednesday, Kevin M. Warsh, another Fed governor, suggested in a speech in Manhattan that the regulatory debate in Congress was not addressing the right questions. 
 ''Policy makers, in my view, should be more focused on what constitutes effective prudential supervision, rather than be diverted to the less consequential discussion as to who should perform it,'' Mr. Warsh told the New York Association for Business Economics. 
 Mr. Warsh said the idea of ''resolution authority'' -- which would empower a regulator to step in and dismantle a failing financial institution before it jeopardized the economy -- ''is unlikely, in the near term, to drive the market discipline required to avoid the recurrence of financial crises.'' 
 Mr. Warsh called for more accurate and timely information to be provided to shareholders, creditors and regulators; more robust competition in the financial services industry, which he described as ''ripe for a healthy dose of creative destruction''; and stronger capital and liquidity requirements, along with better corporate governance and risk management. 
 ''We need a new financial architecture, one in which improved regulation and supervision play an important but co-extensive role with greater market discipline,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Health Official Can't Guarantee Openness in Talks

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, told Congress on Wednesday that she could not guarantee greater openness in negotiations over legislation to remake the nation's health care system.
 ''I am not a principal in the negotiations,'' Ms. Sebelius said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee. ''Nor is my staff.''
 Ms. Sebelius said administration officials provided ''technical support'' to Congress, but did not control the negotiations. 
 Her comments came about five hours after President Obama affirmed the need for openness in efforts by the administration and Congress to finish work on a health bill intended to expand coverage and rein in costs.
 In the rush to pass legislation in December, Senate leaders and White House officials did much of their work behind closed doors, and Mr. Obama said Wednesday that the perception of secrecy may have undermined public trust.
 ''I take some fault for this,'' Mr. Obama said at a meeting with Senate Democrats. ''At the end of the process, when we were fighting through all these filibusters and trying to get it done quickly -- so that we could pivot and start talking about other issues that were so important to the American people -- some of that transparency got lost. And I think we paid a price for it.''
 The chairman of the committee, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said he was ''very confident'' that Congress would soon pass a comprehensive health bill, even though the legislation was now stalled.
 ''We are on the brink of accomplishing real health care reform,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol, not to give up.'' 
 Mr. Obama's budget assumes approval of the legislation. But he and Congressional Democratic leaders have not said how they intend to achieve that goal, in the face of continued opposition from Republicans who say the government cannot afford its existing health care commitments.
 Jobs and the economy have replaced health care as Mr. Obama's top priority, but Ms. Sebelius said passage of the health bill would help create jobs and save them.
 The hearing came as the government issued a report estimating that national health spending totaled $2.5 trillion last year, or 17.3 percent of the economy. The health share of the gross domestic product increased 1.1 percentage points from 2008, the largest one-year increase since the government started keeping track of such data in 1960. 
 A major factor in the growth of health spending was the increase in Medicaid enrollment and Medicaid spending as a result of rising unemployment. As people lost jobs, they lost private insurance, and many turned to Medicaid. 
 Also contributing to the increase, federal officials said, was the fact that many people sought treatment for the H1N1 flu virus.
 The federal report, published on the Web site of the journal Health Affairs, estimates that health spending will climb to $4.5 trillion, or nearly one-fifth of the economy, by 2019.
 Christopher J. Truffer, an actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the main author of the report, predicted that public spending for doctors' services, hospital care and prescription drugs would grow faster than private spending in the coming decade.
 As a result, Mr. Truffer said, the public share of total health spending -- 47 percent in 2008 -- is expected to exceed 50 percent by 2012 and then reach 52 percent by 2019.
 In the report, Mr. Truffer said, ''we do not consider how any health care reform legislation might change the projections.''
 The Congressional Budget Office has said the health bills passed by the House and the Senate could reduce federal deficits in the next 10 years. But Richard S. Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, has said the legislation could also speed the growth of overall health spending, increasing the 10-year total by $220 billion to $290 billion.
 The new report predicts that, under current law, health spending will grow in the next decade at an average annual rate of 6.1 percent, which is 1.7 percentage points faster than the economy as a whole.

HEADLINE: Emerging G.O.P. Group to Promote Conservative Ideas

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A group of prominent Republicans is forming an organization to develop and market conservative ideas, copying a successful Democratic model and hoping to capitalize on the fund-raising and electioneering possibilities opened up by a recent Supreme Court ruling.
 The organizers, including former Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the senior policy adviser to Senator John McCain's presidential campaign, describe their emerging American Action Network as a center-right version of the Center for American Progress, the six-year-old group for progressive policies that was founded by John Podesta, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and an informal adviser to President Obama. 
Republicans who are donors, board members or both include Haley Barbour, the governor of Mississippi; Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida; Ed Gillespie, like Mr. Barbour a former chairman of the Republican Party; Fred Malek, an investor and official in the Nixon and first Bush administrations; Robert K. Steele, a former executive of Wachovia and Goldman Sachs who was a Treasury official in the second Bush administration, and Kenneth G. Langone, a founder of Home Depot and a former director of the New York Stock Exchange.
 A Web site will be unveiled next week. A news conference announcing the center is planned for Feb. 22, followed the next day by a forum on ideas for spurring job creation. 
 The formation of what Mr. Coleman calls an ''action tank'' or ''a think-and-do tank'' reflects the philosophical ferment in the Republican Party as it seeks to rebuild from political and policy setbacks of the Bush years. Similarly, the center-left Center for American Progress opened in 2003 when the Democrats were in political exile and Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress. 
 ''I've often said that President Bush was really bad for our country but really good for my business,'' Mr. Podesta said, recalling his initial efforts to tap the passions of left-leaning donors and scholars. ''My guess is this crew will have the same thing to say about President Obama. It is easier to get started in opposition.''
 Indeed, the Republicans behind American Action Network do give credit to Mr. Obama. Plans began last summer, but floundered at times, according to people familiar with them. Since then the organizers were helped by growing dissatisfaction among conservatives and business people with Mr. Obama's ambitious agenda, and improved prospects for Republican Congressional victories in November.
 And the Supreme Court's decision last month in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission potentially will allow the organization to take unlimited contributions from corporations and individuals to use to advertise for or against political candidates.
 ''This administration as well as Citizens United -- when you combine the two the prospects for funding these types of efforts are greatly enhanced,'' Mr. Coleman said.
 His group's work seems certain to provoke debate among Republicans as well as with Democrats. The organizers are less ideologically conservative than many Republican activists. Mr. Coleman, for example, would not rule out higher taxes as well as spending cuts to reduce the debt.
 And Mr. Langone, one of the early donors, said he had been assured that ''we're not going to go near the social issues.''
 ''This appeals to me for one big reason,'' he said. ''I am very concerned that all the opportunities that were mine are not going to be available to young people coming along the line.'' For that, he blamed President Bush's big-spending policies as well as those of the Democrats.
 Like the Center for American Progress, the tax-exempt American Action Network will be divided into separate units. The Action Forum, which will be the policy arm, is a 501(c)3 group, named for the tax code provision for charitable groups; it allows contributions to be tax deductible but restricts political activities.
 The Action Network, which will advocate for policies and candidates, is a 501(c)4 organization. Contributions are not tax deductible, and the group can advocate for political causes.
 Mr. Podesta said his group has a policy against that and will not change it. Policy work, he said, ''has political relevance but we shouldn't become political actors.''
 The conservatives' policy shop will be headed by Mr. Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. In an interview last May, he said the Republican Party needed to be ''more welcoming of different ideas.''
 ''Having good ideas is not enough,'' he added in an interview. ''You actually have to sell them to the Congress, the president, the citizens.''
 That is what the Center for American Progress has done, the Republicans say, by using the Internet and other tools to engage directly with elected officials and voters on current issues, unlike more cerebral think tanks.
 To run its advocacy half, the organizers have hired Rob Collins, who for the past seven years has been a top adviser to Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the second-ranking House Republican leader.
 Mr. Podesta welcomed the competition. ''Let them have at it,'' he said, ''and we'll be happy to debate them.''

HEADLINE: St. Vincent's Gets Loans For a Four-Week Reprieve

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
The financially ailing St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan in Greenwich Village got a month's reprieve on Wednesday, as Gov. David A. Paterson met with hospital officials, elected officials and others to try to keep the hospital from closing.
 After the 90-minute meeting in his Manhattan office, the governor said that he expected to be able to keep the hospital afloat for the next four weeks through a combination of state loans and help from its creditors. On Tuesday, St. Vincent's received an $8 million loan -- $6 million from the state and $2 million from a creditor -- just to meet its current payroll. 
 But Governor Paterson was guarded about the hospital's long-term prospects, saying only that he was forming a task force to look at how to run the hospital more efficiently and to examine the health care needs of the surrounding community and how they might best be delivered.
 ''We are trying to give it every chance to survive,'' Governor Paterson said of St. Vincent's. But he said the hospital had lost $80 million last year, and made it clear that the state's offer of help was not open-ended, saying, ''We don't want to put supplies on a sinking ship.''
 One person who was at the meeting, who asked not to be named because the meeting was private, said St. Vincent's newly hired restructuring consultant, Mark E. Toney, had suggested that as much as $20 million might be needed to stabilize the hospital. 
 St. Vincent's, which is carrying $700 million in debt, revealed last week that it had been looking for a partner to help keep the hospital from going bankrupt for the second time in five years or being forced to close. Continuum Health Partners, which operates St. Luke's Roosevelt and Beth Israel hospitals in Manhattan, among others, is the only potential partner to have stepped forward.
 But Continuum's plan to close down the hospital's inpatient beds and emergency room, turning it into an outpatient operation, generated immediate opposition from the neighborhood.
 The hospital, founded by the Sisters of Charity, has been serving Greenwich Village since 1849, and is the last remaining Roman Catholic general hospital in New York City.
 The governor said that the Continuum plan had not specifically been discussed at the meeting, but that ''when you have a hospital teetering on the verge of insolvency, there isn't any relief you won't consider.''
 Among others at the meeting were City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn; Alfred E. Smith IV, the chairman of St. Vincent's board; hospital creditors and the state health commissioner, Dr. Richard F. Daines.
 ''We seem to have bought the hospital another four weeks, so that's a good thing,'' Ms. Quinn said. ''We're not in as much of a panic mode.''
 Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, who was also at the meeting, said there seemed to be a willingness on the part of both the state and private creditors to extend credit to St. Vincent's while it tried to restructure. ''The prognosis here is not a good one, but it's probably the best thing that can be done at this point in time,'' Mr. Raske said.
 St. Vincent's merged with several other Catholic hospitals in 2000, but many of those hospitals were in poor neighborhoods, and the merger seemed to only deepen its financial problems. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005 and divested itself of most of the other hospitals, which were sold or closed.
 But St. Vincent's officials said the main hospital had been hobbled by mortgage debt and pension obligations from the divested facilities, as well as the recession, Medicare and Medicaid cuts and a high proportion of poor patients.

HEADLINE: Iraq Court Overturns Ban on Candidates

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Reporting was contributed by Nada Bakri, Anthony Shadid, Omar al-Jawoshy and Zaid Thaker.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Iraq's political crisis deepened on Wednesday after an appeals court overturned a ban on hundreds of candidates in next month's election for having ties to Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki then disputed that ruling. 
 The ban had prompted threats of election boycotts and warnings that the credibility of the election itself was at stake if political groups, particularly Sunnis, felt disenfranchised. And it stoked fears of renewed violence as American troops were beginning to withdraw. 
 The court also said it would reconsider the ban after the March 7 election, raising the possibility of further political turmoil by ousting elected members of Parliament should their ties with the Baath Party be established. The initial effort to knock more than 500 candidates off the ballot -- both Sunnis and Shiites, but mostly those viewed as rivals to Mr. Maliki's bloc -- created a political furor and deeply alarmed American and United Nations officials. 
 The ruling by a panel of seven judges appeared at first to be an exercise of judicial independence in a still young democracy. It followed weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations and diplomacy, especially from the Obama administration, which sent Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to Iraq in the midst of the turmoil.
 As the crisis turned to impasse, Iraqi, American and United Nations officials all looked to Iraq's judiciary to resolve a crisis that its politicians could not. ''This decision will strengthen the integrity of our judiciary,'' said Aliyah Nasyif, a member of Parliament who was among those initially barred. 
 Mr. Maliki did not immediately comment, but the state television network reported late on Wednesday that he did not believe the country's election commission was bound by the ruling and that he had called for an emergency session of Parliament to review the ban on candidates.
 Mr. Maliki's opposition raised the specter of yet another constitutional crisis, this time over the untested balance of power between Iraq's branches of government. It was not clear, though, whether he could force the Parliament to counter the court's ruling, or even muster an emergency session, given the outpouring of support for the decision.
 ''There are many questions which have been raised about this decision,'' said one of Mr. Maliki's allies, Sadiq al-Riqabi. ''This legal ruling has to be reconciled with the Constitution. No one has the authority to postpone any article in the Constitution. Personally, I'm afraid there is a politicization of this constitutional issue.''
 The court's legal rationale for overturning the ban was not made public, but many lawmakers had questioned the murky process by which a committee with disputed authority, known as the Accountability and Justice Commission, was able to bar nearly one in six candidates based on evidence that has never been made public. 
 The court's ruling appeared to have averted a threatened boycott by at least one prominent coalition most affected by the initial ban: Iraqiya, led by a former Shiite prime minister, Ayad Allawi. The coalition includes an array of Sunni and secular parties and is widely seen as the most formidable challenger to Mr. Maliki's bloc and a second, largely Shiite, alliance. A Sunni boycott of Iraq's first parliamentary election in 2005 fueled a widespread sense of Sunni disenfranchisement and strengthened the insurgency.
 ''This is a great victory for democracy, for us, for Iraq,'' Osama Nujaifi, a Sunni member of Parliament from Nineveh Province, said of the ruling in a telephone interview from Amman, Jordan, where he was traveling.
 Even as the court tried to resolve the immediate crisis, the implication that the election commission could disqualify candidates after the election planted the seeds of a new one. Aside from Mr. Maliki's opposition, Iraqi law does not have a provision for unseating elected officials. An election official, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, warned that disqualifying anyone duly elected would violate popular will.
 ''The voters will be the only losers,'' the official said.
 For now, at least, the court's ruling set the stage for a fierce campaign, returning to the ballot a number of prominent politicians seeking to tap into the seething discontent with Mr. Maliki's government, and not only among Sunnis. 
 ''We don't want to blame the government, but the fact is it is negligence,'' the speaker of Parliament, Ayad al-Sammarai, told tribal leaders on Wednesday in a pre-election critique that blamed Mr. Maliki for having failed to provide security and jobs.
 Some of those disqualified appeared to have only tenuous ties, if any, to the Baath Party, the only official political entity allowed under Mr. Hussein's government and one that dominated social and economic life. The process for establishing those ties dates from the early months after the American invasion in 2003 when the party was banned after Mr. Hussein's fall. 
 A revival of the Baath Party itself seems almost inconceivable now, but many of those challenging Mr. Maliki have appealed to Sunnis with sympathies to elements of the old government, particularly in the military and former government elite. Mr. Maliki himself has attacked the Baath Party's remnants in exile, accusing them of colluding with terrorist groups to carry out a series of devastating attacks since last August.
 Many lawmakers accused the commission of settling scores on behalf of the Shiite-dominated parties, at the behest of Iran.
 ''The decision of the commission is a sword on my neck because of my opinions against Iran,'' said Dhafir al-Ani, another Sunni who was disqualified.
 Iraq remains so deeply divided that even establishing the rules for an election -- which was supposed to happen in December and then in January -- has been fraught for much of the last year, largely paralyzing the work of Parliament. An election law stalled for months last year, only to be passed, then vetoed, passed again and finally amended after another intense round of international intervention.

HEADLINE: Currency Dispute Likely to Further Fray U.S.-China Ties

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
To the growing list of grievances between the United States and China, add one more: the Obama administration is reviving American pressure on China to stop artificially depressing its currency, a policy that fuels its persistent trade gap with the United States.
 The administration has told Chinese officials that currency policy will be high on its agenda this year for economic talks with China, a senior official said on Wednesday. The White House is also weighing whether to designate China as a country that manipulates its currency, when the Treasury Department issues its semiannual report on foreign currencies in April. 
 President Obama signaled the tougher line on Wednesday, telling Democratic senators that the United States needed ''to make sure our goods are not artificially inflated in price and their goods are not artificially deflated in price; that puts us at a huge competitive disadvantage.''
 Reopening the battle with Beijing over its currency may pay political dividends for Mr. Obama at a time of double-digit unemployment and growing fears that China is stealing American jobs. But experts say the president will have even less leverage over Beijing than President George W. Bush did. Mr. Bush prodded China for years to adjust its exchange rate with little success.
 China, they say, is determined to reignite its export machine after a global recession that sapped demand for Chinese goods. A cheap currency is vital to that goal. And China's leaders have grown impatient with lectures on economic policy from their chief debtor, the United States.
 ''It will be like water off a duck's back,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''They're puzzled by the criticism. They think they should be praised for keeping their currency stable at a time of global turmoil.''
 Criticizing China's policy, however, is likely to worsen a relationship already frayed by irritants on both sides.
 In two weeks, Mr. Obama is expected to meet with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, over the objections of the Chinese, who condemn him as a subversive. The administration forged ahead with sales of weapons to Taiwan, drawing an angry blast from Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a breakaway province. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized China for censoring the Internet, in the wake of Google's allegations about hacking.
 For its part, the United States is frustrated that the Chinese will not back tougher sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. And China has resisted American initiatives on climate change policy, turning the recent climate meeting in Copenhagen into a diplomatic drama.
 The administration has struggled to prevent the ill will from any single issue from contaminating the broader relationship. ''We can't pick the timing of when an issue becomes important,'' said a senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter.
 Exchange rates are an arcane subject, harder to explain than a meeting with the Dalai Lama. But they influence easy-to-understand issues like the competitiveness of American exports and job security.
 ''The currency issue has the potential to become a very hot political issue,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, who worked on China policy in the Clinton White House. ''We're in significant danger of hitting a very rough patch in trade relations, in the latter part of this year.''
 The first question for Mr. Obama in his meeting with Senate Democrats came from Senator Arlen Specter, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and it was about China. What, he asked, did the president plan to do to respond to China's ''unfair trade advantage,'' which he said caused the huge trade imbalance?
 Mr. Obama talked about enforcing existing trade agreements, before raising the issue of exchange rates. If the United States was able to increase its exports to Asia by a single percentage point, he said, it would generate thousands, maybe millions, of new jobs in the country.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, urged the president to put China on the list of currency manipulators, something the administration has not done in its first two reports.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has sponsored legislation that would impose sanctions on China for its currency policy, said he hoped the popular mood would push the White House.
 ''One of the main causes of the public's discontent is that they feel China doesn't treat us fairly, and that no one is doing anything about it,'' Mr. Schumer said in an interview. ''That may importune the administration to act, but if they don't, there's a strong move in Congress to do so.''
 Another factor affecting the administration may be shifting economic fortunes in both countries. China is rebounding faster from the recession than the United States, and as it does, the imbalances that result from its artificially depressed currency could become even starker.
 Economists estimate that China's currency, the renminbi, is undervalued by at least 25 percent and as much as 40 percent, relative to the dollar and other currencies. That gap, they say, is wider than at any time since 2005, when Beijing, under pressure from the Bush administration, allowed the renminbi to rise modestly.
 Given that, the administration hopes China, on its own, will come to recognize the need for a new currency policy.
 ''The silver lining of what the U.S. and China have been through is that there's a greater appreciation in China of policies that would stimulate internal growth and make it less dependent on exports,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 The administration's point person on China's currency is the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who has an awkward history on the subject. In a written answer to questions during his confirmation process, Mr. Geithner said that China was manipulating its currency. He later disavowed that statement, and set about smoothing ruffled feathers in Beijing.
 ''Many of us in Congress are pretty frustrated that the administration has made no progress on this,'' Mr. Schumer said.

20,000 Reasons a Company Might Not Want to Hire 
 As Congress, the Obama administration and the states consider ways to encourage hiring, they should look at incentives, but they should also consider the disincentives.
The unemployment insurance tax may be the most confusing and misunderstood tax there is. It is run by the states, and the rules can vary as much as the weather from one state to another.
 Here's how it works in Illinois, where I own several small businesses. The important point for business owners to know is that when the state pays out claims to a company's former employees, that company's unemployment tax rate goes up. 
 For each business, the state calculates how many dollars have been paid in compensation over the previous three years and adds on about 48 percent through various calculations. 
 The result is that in Illinois, you end up paying for incremental compensation claims at a rate of $1.48 for every dollar that an ex-employee collects.
 I understand and agree with the concept of unemployment insurance. It can be a lifeline for people who have lost their jobs. It is the cost of doing business and of being responsible, especially to people who have held a job for years. 
 I do question, however, the eligibility rules, at least in Illinois. In some states, an employee has to work 90 days to be eligible. In Illinois, it is 30 working days.
 That makes it entirely possible that a business can be taxed more than $20,000 -- $531 (weekly payment) x 26 (weeks) x 1.48 (tax rate) -- for someone who is fired or laid off after being employed for as few as 30 days. 
 How much incentive does this provide for businesses to risk hiring people who may or may not work out? JAY GOLTZ COMMENTSHere is an even worse situation. In New York (I don't know about other states), if someone voluntarily quits and takes another job, and then is laid off from that job, the first employer's record is charged even though the employee quit and would not have been eligible for unemployment after (s)he left that job. -- AM
 Yes, I too discovered this the hard way. Due to hard times a few years ago I had to let a longtime employee go and let her file for unemployment undisputed. Now I owe the state for all the money she collected and my unemployment tax rate is sky high. Fortunately here in Colorado I only have to pay the rate on the first $10,000 of each employee's wages and since I'm the only employee at the moment it isn't too bad. But, yes, I don't want to hire anyone else until the cash flow is adequate to pay hidden costs like this one. It's a huge disincentive to hiring. 
 -- Hugh Robertson
 Is It That Tough To Get Credit?
 On Sunday, The New York Times published an article about small businesses that turn to purchase-order financing to keep their operations running. The reporter, Andrew Martin, talked to business owners who pay interest rates as high as 40 percent on an annualized basis to borrow money from a purchase-order lender, Hartsko Financial Services, whose New York City offices are in Queens. 
 ''For lack of a better word,'' the article quotes one of Hartsko's small-business clients as saying, ''it's almost like loan sharking.''
 We asked You're the Boss readers: Are things really so bad that it's necessary to pay 40 percent interest rate for a loan? Are there no better options for viable businesses that get turned down by the big banks?
 COMMENTSWhat kind of a business are you if you can't survive without stacking up debt or can't survive without a loan? That means you don't have a viable for-profit business model, and if you were a bank you wouldn't give yourself money either.
 -- Ramin Aliyev
 There's plenty of credit out there. It's at credit unions. Any small business trying to use big banks is not going to have any luck. It's very simple, but most people don't know what a credit union is. -- Frank
 As a small-business owner, I have to say getting credit is incredibly hard nowadays. But I must admit that in my case, it's a mixed blessing. In the past it was so easy to get credit, I find myself $300K in debt over five years. Now, with no credit to be had, I am forced to be extremely disciplined about my spending. It is very difficult to run a business without a lot of capital, but in a way I'm glad that I am not
 getting into any more debt.

 A Costly Surprise For Borrowers
 To judge by the accounts of You're the Boss readers, the only thing more frustrating than being declined for one of the emergency bridge loans created by the stimulus program may be getting approved for one.
 Sharon Essl, a restaurant owner in New Jersey, recently commented on the blog that after submitting an America's Recovery Capital loan application to Wells Fargo on July 31 -- and resubmitting it three more times -- her loan was finally approved two months later. 
 ''But -- wait for it,'' she wrote. ''Still have not closed!'' In an interview last week, Ms. Essl said that she had received the closing papers and was expecting the first installment of funds -- four months after she was approved.
 Nearly a year after the stimulus became law, and nearly halfway through the ARC's arc, Wells Fargo apparently still is not completely certain how the Small Business Administration, which administers the ARC loans, wants its documentation presented. Ms. Essl said bankers, after initially approving her loan, came back several times seeking the same information again. She described being bounced from banker to banker, each one asking her to submit a new balance sheet.
 And Ms. Essl found one more unpleasant surprise waiting for her in the closing papers: a fee of nearly $600 to cover the cost of a lien search. ''Nowhere, anywhere through this whole process,'' she said, the weariness evident in her voice, ''did anybody say there were fees of that magnitude.'' 
 Though widely reported to be no-fee loans, a close reading of S.B.A. statements usually reveals this important qualification: the loans ''have no S.B.A. fees associated with them.'' For Ms. Essl's $20,000 loan, the non-S.B.A. fee worked out to 3 percent. ROBB MANDELBAUM COMMENTMy business wasn't eligible for an ARC loan (we're not profitable yet), but the exercise in sadism it has turned out to be is no great loss to me -- I have a business to run. Help? Fuhgeddaboudit. What I've learned is that I'm on my own. -- PAS
 From Big to Small Market
 Since moving to northwest Arkansas, I've met several business owners who relocated to the area for the same reasons my husband and I did. 
 One such owner is Geneva Currin, a 20-year veteran of the floral industry who moved to Bentonville from Chicago. She said she had sent an endless stream of arrangements to Oprah Winfrey's offices and counted Michael Jordan and his wife among her clients.
 But the pressures of being a single mother and business owner in Chicago eventually led Ms. Currin to move closer to family members. She sold her house and her business and moved with her 2-year-old son to northwest Arkansas. ''I was open for business in three months,'' she said of Bloom, the flower shop she opened in July 2003 on the historic Bentonville Square.
 One of the benefits of being in a small town, Ms. Currin said, is having customers who are much more forgiving. ''They want you to work 24/7 in a big city,'' she explained. ''Now my customers don't expect me to be behind the counter every time they walk in. In a small town, they'll let you close on Sundays.''
 One suggestion to consider before making a move: Rent a house in the area before buying. Ms. Currin first moved to Taos, N.M., where she rented a villa only to find that she didn't care for the arid climate and landscape. BARBARA TAYLOR 
 COMMENTS Nice story, but it's ironic how having Wal-Mart's headquarters nearby helped the local economy while across the country Wal-Mart stores are helping to destroy countless local economies. -- travislessness
 We moved to Northwest Arkansas from the big city (Chicago) in 2006 when my wife, who is a school administrator, was offered a job in Bentonville. Candidly, we probably could have not picked a worse time to move to northwest Arkansas. The local real estate market crashed hard shortly after we opened our doors, which had an immediate affect on my business. We eventually closed the business after two years, and after losing about $150,000.

HEADLINE: Few News Conferences, But Still Taking Questions

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Over the last two weeks, President Obama has taken questions from unemployed workers in Ohio, students in Florida and a cancer survivor in New Hampshire. He took questions from YouTube users, Senate Democrats and even House Republicans. Almost everyone, it seems, but the White House press corps.
 After a year in office, Mr. Obama has managed to do what every modern president may have wanted to do but never did: effectively shut out the reporters who work just a few feet from the Oval Office. He has not had a full-scale White House news conference in seven months, the longest such stretch by any president in a decade. And he has made a practice of not taking reporters' questions at day-to-day events, as other presidents did. 
 None of that means that Mr. Obama has shielded himself from public scrutiny. But he has fundamentally altered the way a president deals with the news media. Instead of open-ended sessions with multiple reporters, he prefers one-on-one interviews, particularly with television anchors. He gives far more interviews than his two most recent predecessors did, reflecting the conclusion that the format is a more effective means for getting his message through.
 ''He's getting plenty of tough questions,'' said Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. ''I just think they want to put him in environments where he can demonstrate both his mastery of the subject and make a compelling case for his agenda. A White House press conference isn't at the top of that list. That's just the reality.''
 The president's strategy reflects the changing nature of the media as much as political calculation by the White House. Whereas the wire services, major newspapers and broadcast networks once dominated the White House briefing room, today they are hardly the only filter for news. 
 Mr. Obama has made a concerted effort to tap into alternative avenues, including blogs, Internet videos, Facebook, Twitter, Spanish-language television and magazines oriented to African-Americans. He eats lunch with columnists and talks with ESPN and People. He was the first president to appear on the Jay Leno and David Letterman shows. 
 ''The power and influence among the press used to be concentrated in a small handful of people who sit in the first two rows of the White House briefing room,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''And that's no longer the case.''
 ''On any given day,'' Mr. Pfeiffer added, ''an item on Huffington Post or The Drudge Report can be as influential as something in The New York Times or Washington Post.''
 Indeed, the White House press corps itself is evolving. The press pool that takes turns covering the president up close now includes Web-only publications like Talking Points Memo, The Huffington Post and The Daily Caller. And given the widespread disdain for the mainstream media, there seems to be no price to be paid for bypassing beat reporters, who risk looking like whiners if they complain.
 ''I would never have been bold enough to say totally ignore the mainstream media when it comes to pool sprays,'' said Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary for President George W. Bush. ''And what's even more breathtaking is, he's been able to carve out the mainstream media and he's getting away with it.''
 Pool spray is the term for an event where a representative pool of journalists is brought in to record the president meeting with a foreign leader or discussing a policy initiative. Past presidents have typically taken two or three questions at such moments. Mr. Obama typically does not.
 During his first year in office, Mr. Obama took questions at pool sprays 46 times, compared with the 147 times Mr. Bush did and 252 times Mr. Clinton did in the comparable periods, according to statistics compiled by Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor of political science at Towson University.
 And while Mr. Obama had five full-scale White House news conferences early in his tenure, he has not had any since July, when he declared that the police had ''acted stupidly'' in arresting a black Harvard professor, touching off a racial furor that distracted from his health care message for days. Mr. Pfeiffer said the episode had nothing to do with the lack of White House news conferences since then, and Mr. Obama has held limited sessions with reporters on the road or jointly with foreign leaders.
 Still, the seven months without a formal White House news conference is longer than Jimmy Carter or either George Bush went without one. Mr. Clinton and Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, each went long stretches without one, most notably during the Monica Lewinsky and Iran-contra scandals.
 Mr. Obama has been much more expansive with interviews than either of them. In his first year, he gave 161 interviews, compared with 50 by Mr. Bush and 53 by Mr. Clinton in their first year in office.
 ''In an interview, you talk about what you want to talk about,'' Ms. Kumar said. ''In a press conference, you talk about what the reporters want to talk about. That's the difference and why you want to do one and not the other.''
 Mr. Pfeiffer said the White House media strategy was based on discipline. ''We have done press conferences and we will do them again,'' he said. But, he added, ''you want to do these things when you have something to communicate, something to say, not just be a pinata for the press corps.''

HEADLINE: Obama Calls For Support In Promoting Clean Fuels

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama moved on Wednesday to bolster the nation's production of corn-based ethanol and other alternative liquid fuels and ordered the rapid development of technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal.
 The president is trying to expand the portfolio of American energy sources to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, a factor in global warming, and spur advances in alternative technologies. Last week he expressed support in his State of the Union address for increased generation of nuclear power and offshore drilling for oil and gas.
 Mr. Obama's motives are environmental, economic and political. He is trying to address climate change by replacing dirty fuels with cleaner sources, jump-start an American clean-energy industry, reduce dependence on foreign oil and attract Republican votes for legislation to do all three. 
 Efforts to pass a broad energy and climate bill remain mired in the Senate, with some senators challenging the notion that the earth is warming.
 ''Now, there's no reason that we shouldn't be able to work together in a bipartisan way to get this done,'' Mr. Obama said after opening a meeting with several cabinet officers and a bipartisan group of about a dozen governors to discuss his energy agenda.
 ''I know that there is some concern about how energy fits together with climate change,'' he said. ''I happen to believe that climate change is one of the reasons why we've got to pursue a clean energy agenda, but it's not the only reason.'' 
 ''So even if you don't believe in the severity of climate change, as I do, you still should want to pursue this agenda. It's good for our national security and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It's good for our economy because it will produce jobs.''
 To that end, the administration announced that it was completing a rule to try to meet a mandate in a 2007 energy bill to produce 36 billion gallons of ethanol and advanced biofuels a year by 2022. The United States now produces 12 billion gallons of biofuels, mostly corn-based ethanol. The country does not have the capacity to triple that production.
 The Environmental Protection Agency said that meeting the 2022 standard would reduce oil use by 328 billion barrels a year. To qualify under the biofuels program, the agency said, producers must demonstrate that their fuels produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions than oil does throughout the life cycle -- growing, processing, transport and burning.
 The Agriculture Department said it would provide financing to farmers, ranchers and foresters to convert biomass -- farm and forest waste, sugar cane, switch grass and other materials -- into liquid fuels for land, air and sea transportation.
 And the Energy Department said it would try to build five to 10 projects by 2016 to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal.
 ''Our nation's economy will continue to rely on the availability and affordability of domestic coal for decades to meet its energy needs, and these advances are necessary to reduce pollution in the meantime,'' said Steven Chu, the energy secretary.
 Representatives of the biofuels industry generally welcomed the announcement. But they expressed concern about whether adequate federal support would be available to ensure financing for the plants and pipelines needed to make biofuels competitive with oil. They said that rules on life cycle emissions might be so strict as to favor oil.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about an Obama administration initiative to increase production of biofuels misstated the projected decrease in annual oil consumption if the nation meets its biofuels target by 2022. It would fall by 328 million -- not billion -- barrels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

HEADLINE: Europe's Focus on Saving Jobs Pays Off in a Recession

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
The soaring glass and iron Siemens factory here opened almost exactly a century ago. At first, it churned out electricity turbines, then munitions during World War II before being looted by the Soviets, which required it to be rebuilt at the dawn of the cold war.
 Today, it is manufacturing turbines again -- except these models are among the most advanced in the world, each one able to power all the homes in this city of three million.
 ''It's not a museum; it's a workshop,'' said Michael Schwarzlose, a project manager at the plant.
 The same might be said for much of Europe itself, despite American suspicions to the contrary. European companies may not be as nimble as their counterparts in the United States, but in moving to preserve jobs through the worst global downturn since the end of the war, they have forged a different path toward recovery. 
 They are making old plants more modern and effective rather than watching workers or companies deemed uncompetitive fall by the wayside. 
 European companies have paid a price: lower profits and productivity than their American competitors. But as long-suffering American workers face the prospect of a jobless recovery, many analysts believe the European model may deserve another look. 
 ''American companies have been faster to adjust their work forces and quicker in protecting profit margins,'' said Gilles Moec, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank. But that does not mean companies on the Continent have fallen behind in innovation, experts say. 
 Americans often assume newer, smaller companies are the engines of innovation and job creation -- hence President Obama's decision to make a $30 billion program to encourage small-business loans a centerpiece of his jobs plan. 
 Europe, in stark contrast, often relies on its large companies to sustain both employment and a cutting edge in important industries. One crucial tool, along with such measures as work-sharing, is a reliance on environmental innovation.
 ''The large incumbents in Europe, which might have been considered technological laggards, have used green technology and sustainability as a core new element of growth,'' said Luc Soete, a professor of international economics at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. 
 Some large companies are surprisingly resilient. The Siemens factory added 500 workers here in the depths of the economic crisis last year, beginning production of new gas-burning turbines that are the most powerful Siemens makes but emit substantially less carbon dioxide than older models. 
 In Europe, fuel is heavily taxed, and there are substantial subsidies for producing alternative energy. Such incentives serve a dual purpose: supporting employment at green-oriented companies in the short term and, Europeans hope, giving their companies a strategic advantage when the global economy and demand pick up.
 At Siemens, for example, with revenue increasing 11 percent from 2008 to 2009, its broad green portfolio is now growing faster than its other businesses, Barbara Kux, the chief sustainability officer at the company, said. 
 She points to the state-of-the-art products of the Berlin factory that manufactures turbines. ''It's part of sustainability, and it shows you think long term and are there to stay,'' she said. ''It gives you the chance to keep experienced people, to keep their knowledge in-house and develop a high level of loyalty and trust so they feel like part of a family rather than just doing a job.''
 The varying responses to the economic downturn come amid a fierce debate in the United States over whether the country is headed toward a more European economic model, given Washington's huge support of big banks and the auto industry, as well as Mr. Obama's proposal to overhaul the health care system. 
 ''The end result would be an America much closer to the European model of a social-welfare state, which prioritizes cohesion over innovation,'' warned a recent article in National Affairs, a quarterly journal. The article was by Jim Manzi, a former software executive who is now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group.
 While unemployment has soared to 20 percent and higher in European countries like Spain and Latvia, the relative success of other European countries in avoiding deep job cuts adds a new wrinkle to a longstanding trans-Atlantic argument.
 The overall European unemployment rate of 10 percent matches that of the United States, but northern and central Europe have fared much better, with joblessness at 4 percent in the Netherlands, and 5.4 percent in Austria, for example.
 Germany's economy contracted 5 percent last year, yet its unemployment rate of 7.5 percent is actually down from two years ago. By contrast, the economy of the United States shrank 2.4 percent last year as unemployment doubled, to 10 percent, over the period.
 The ability of the German economy, the biggest in Europe, to stanch job losses despite a markedly deeper recession than that in the United States is ''something of an economic miracle,'' Jorg Kramer, chief economist for Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said. 
 Much of the attention on saving jobs has focused on the government's short-work program, in which taxpayers and companies share the cost of furloughing workers. But Mr. Kramer said the government-financed program of shorter workweeks was responsible for saving only about 20 percent of jobs.
 ''Half of this miracle can be explained because firms allowed workers to do less; they tolerated a 2.5 percent drop in productivity,'' he added. ''You can either cut workers or cut hours.''
 In the more flexible American labor market, where industrial unions are weak and contracts far less rigid, companies responded more often by letting workers go, sharply cutting costs and preserving profit margins.
 German companies not only reduced hours on the job, but they also made a decision to accept lower profit margins in the short term, Mr. Kramer said, a practice he called ''labor-hoarding.''
 In Germany, profit margins have fallen to just 0.58 percent in the latest quarter, from 6.26 percent in the first quarter of 2008, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Similarly, French profit margins have dropped to 1.2 percent, from 6.5 percent. By contrast, corporate profitability in the United States has shrunk to 3.6 percent, from 7.8 percent. 
 Europeans hope that as the recovery picks up steam, European competitors will be well situated to take advantage of new growth opportunities while American companies will be required to rebuild their work forces.
 But if the feared ''double-dip recession'' does arise, the leaner profile of big companies in the United States could help them hold up better.
 European experts say that the varying strategies of companies during the financial crisis, and the different ways they treated their workers, ought to prompt a revision of the traditional American view that Europe's social democracies are condemned to slow growth and high unemployment.
 ''It's not true that there is a correlation between how much you spend on social policy and welfare and economic growth,'' said Paolo Guerrieri, a professor of international economics at the University of Rome I. ''The best performing group -- Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Germany -- are exactly the kind of countries that shouldn't be doing well according to the American stereotype of high taxes and high welfare benefits.''
 Siemens is an example of the kind of European company that is leading the way. 
 Although its global work force has shrunk over the last five years as it exited businesses like telecommunications and auto parts, that has not stopped it from making advances in facilities like its Berlin factory, even if the setting resembles ''Metropolis,'' the 1927 film from Fritz Lang. 
 The 163-year-old company spent 500 million euros, or close to $700 million, to develop the new turbines being built at the Berlin factory as part of a push into green technology, which it broadly defines to include low carbon dioxide-emitting turbines and locomotives, solar paneling and wind technology, as well as air and purification equipment. 
 Siemens managed to save its customers an estimated 210 million tons in carbon dioxide emissions last year, the equivalent of the amount generated annually by New York, Tokyo, London and Berlin combined.
 ''The global economic crisis has actually allowed us to increase our green advantage,'' Ms. Kux said. ''It's an opportunity to jump ahead, cut costs and improve our own resources.''

HEADLINE: Prius Brake Inquiry May Be Another Blow for Toyota

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI and KEITH BRADSHER; Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Nagoya, Japan, and Keith Bradsher from Wuhan, China. Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: NAGOYA, Japan 

 BODY:
The Prius, a centerpiece of Japan's cutting-edge technology, fell victim to Toyota's widening quality crisis on Wednesday after Japanese authorities told the automaker to investigate reports of faulty brakes on the gas-electric hybrid.
 The troubles appeared to weigh on the company's stock price, which dropped almost 5 percent in early trading Thursday after Tokyo's Nikkei opened. 
 Slow-moving brakes on the car may have led to a collision last July, just months after the third-generation Prius went on sale in Japan, the country's Transport Ministry warned Wednesday. At least 77 more cases of possible brake malfunctions have been reported in Japan since the newest model went on sale in May.
 The company had not yet decided about a recall, but a spokeswoman, Ririko Takeuchi, said a defect with the brakes could not be ruled out.
 Concerns over the Prius's safety threatens to undermine Toyota's reputation even in its home market, where confidence in the carmaker has appeared watertight despite a worldwide recall of other models because of sticky gas pedals and unintended acceleration.
 The difficulties with brakes on the hybrid Prius could deal a second blow to the automaker's reputation for quality. Toyota executives must now confront complaints that seem tailor-made for late-night comedians -- some cars that keep accelerating against the driver's will and others that fail to stop promptly when the driver hits the brakes.
 ''There couldn't have been a worse timing for Toyota,'' said Koji Endo, analyst at the research agency, Advanced Research Japan.
 The Prius is one of the world's best-known cars and the centerpiece of Toyota's campaign to portray itself as more environmentally aware and progressive than its rivals. Toyota had promoted the cutting-edge design of the Prius brakes as a feature that gives the car a technological edge and better mileage.
 Faced with the shutdown of more than half its sales in the United States because of a recall of cars with faulty gas pedals in several Toyota models, Toyota embraced the Prius even more tightly this week, making it the focus of the company's advertising.
 But on Wednesday, Japan's Transport Ministry said it had told Toyota to investigate 14 reports of momentary brake failure since the car went on sale in May.
 Drivers complained that the brakes on the newest Prius momentarily stopped working at low speeds, especially on slippery surfaces, said Kenji Sato, a Transport Ministry official. In one incident in July 2009, a Prius crashed head-on into another vehicle at an intersection, hurting two people in that car.
 In the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has logged at least 136 complaints about the brakes on the 2010 Prius. Many are from drivers who say the vehicle surged forward or temporarily lost braking after driving over a pothole or other uneven surface, and many say it is a recurring problem.
 Four cases involved a crash, and two of those resulted in injuries, according to the safety agency's complaint database.
 Ms. Takeuchi stressed that the newest Prius model was fitted with an overhauled regenerative brake system different from the ones used in previous models, which had not caused any complaints.
 ''We are examining any complaints that we hear through our dealers, one by one,'' said Shinichi Sasaki, an executive at Toyota in charge of quality. ''Only after that can we get back to our customers on possible improvement.'' 
 Experts say a possible problem with the regenerative brakes in the Prius raises a conundrum not just for Toyota but for the entire industry. It is also bad news for environmental advocates who considered the technology one way to help improve fuel economy and reduce the contribution of automobiles to global warming.
 Regenerative braking is simple in theory but complicated in practice. The energy of most cars' momentum is wasted during braking, as brake pads exert friction against rotors on the wheels and heat up. The theory of regenerative braking is that the car's momentum is partly used to recharge a car battery.
 This helps to slow the car while storing power that can be used to help the car regain speed later. John German, a semi-retired auto engineer and an expert on environmental engine technologies, said that adding regenerative braking improves a car's gas mileage while driving in a congested city by at least 10 percent.
 Practically all hybrid cars have regenerative braking.
 ''The greater benefits occur if there are frequent braking events, as you find in congested city driving,'' said Danilo J. Santini, an urban systems engineer at Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Ill. 
 Some early hybrids, like the Honda Insight, added regenerative braking to conventional brake pads for extra force in slowing a car. But the Prius and other hybrids increasingly rely on complex electronics to combine the regenerative braking with brake pads, so that battery recharging absorbs as much energy as possible.
 Mr. German, who is now the program director at the International Council on Clean Transportation, an environmental group, said that possible problems with the brakes on the Prius might have nothing to do with the electronics system and, might, in fact, be related to the conventional brakes.
 If any problem does surface on the Prius, it could prove troublesome as Toyota tries to rebut claims that electronics difficulties, and not flaws in gas pedals, are behind incidents of sudden acceleration in Toyota and Lexus cars.
 Meanwhile, Japanese regulators have been stepping up their vigilance after long being known for a passive role in identifying possible auto defects. Auto safety is overseen by the Transport Ministry, and its recall division solicits reports of possible defects from the public and posts them on a Web site.
 A catalyst for the government's expanded role was a scandal in 2000 involving the cover-up of a string of defects by Mitsubishi Motors, which almost drove the automaker out of business. The number of cars affected by recalls in Japan have surged since then, jumping to 5.07 million in 2008 from 680,216 in 1998.
 The ministry's recall unit stressed, however, that its request to investigate the Prius brakes was routine. The unit handles about 5,000 complaints a year.
 ''The government intends to get involved to examine whether a recall will become necessary or not,'' Japan's transport minister, Seiji Maehara, said .

HEADLINE: A Small-Business Owner Takes His Case to the Top

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
Last week, one entrepreneur had the opportunity to ask President Obama a question that no doubt has been on the mind of many others. The venue was a town hall meeting in Tampa, Fla., on Thursday, the day after the president's State of the Union address. ''I'm frustrated because I can create 500 jobs,'' began Steve Gordon. ''I've gone to the banks, I can't get a loan. You lent directly to Wall Street, you lent directly to the automakers, you lent directly to the banks -- why can't the government make [small-business loans] available directly to us?''
 Mr. Gordon, 53, started his company, Instant-Off, back in 1991. The Clearwater-based firm employs two people full time and 30 part time to make an inexpensive valve that conserves water by automatically shutting off a faucet like the spigot on a soda fountain. The valves are sold to the food-service industry, and also to consumers through Home Depot, but Mr. Gordon says he lacks the capital to expand. Last year, Instant-Off's revenue was about $350,000. 
 The businessman was moved to ask his question after a particularly frustrating meeting two days earlier with a regional director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Mr. Gordon recounted that after explaining why her agency couldn't arrange a loan for Instant-Off, the official suggested he audition for ''Shark Tank'', the ABC reality series that is sort of an ''American Idol'' for entrepreneurs. Mr. Gordon says he arrived at the Obama event two and a half hours early and chose his seat carefully -- at the president's eye level, near an aisle. 
 The president, in a lengthy response, explained that the Small Business Administration ''does not have the infrastructure to go all across the country in every region and process loans to small businesses directly.'' (You can watch the entire exchange, or read it here.)
 On Tuesday, The Times spoke to Mr. Gordon about his business, his ambitions, and his reaction to the president's answer. What follows is a condensed version of the conversation. 
 Q. You told the president that you couldn't get a loan. What happened?
 A. What started the big capital push is we didn't have the money to fill orders from Home Depot. So I called the S.B.A. in Miami, which sent me to all these microlenders in Florida. But they turned us down; they said they didn't have enough funding.
 Q. Did you try to get an S.B.A. 7(a) working capital loan?
 A. I met with SunTrust and Bank of America -- Bank of America was my bank -- and they told me that I would not qualify because my credit score was not high enough. I came out of the building industry, and I lost my company during the real estate crash in 2006. I was right in the middle of a beautiful, $35 million town home project when the meltdown occurred. So when I lost all that money, it put me in a capital vacuum, and my credit score suffered.
 But it wasn't just the credit score -- they needed hard assets on the floor. They either needed equipment or they needed to secure it against inventory. All of our stuff is hand-assembled; the equipment we have is probably worth $50,000. But I need $250,000, and they said, ''No, you're not going to be able to get $250,000 with $50,000 of assets.''
 Q. Is your business profitable?
 A. If you look at our sales versus our costs, yes, we're profitable. But most of that goes to overhead and other costs because the volume is low.
 Q. Are you paying bills on time?
 A. Yes, but barely.
 Q. The president said that one cause of the recession is that banks took on too much risk when they made commercial loans. Why should a bank -- or the government, for that matter -- make a loan to someone who has poor credit and no assets?
 A. Well, first of all, I'm not a bad credit risk. What happened to me happened to every developer and every builder and every single person related to the real estate industry nationwide. Every single one of us -- millions of people -- had their credit trashed because of this crash. 
 But the government should take that risk because I'm a much better risk than A.I.G. I'm a much better risk than a lot of the things they've invested in because I can produce results now. They loan me the money, I can create jobs now. 
 Q. How much do you want, and what would you do with it?
 A. I need between $250,000 and $500,000. About $50,000 of this money would go to filing patents in foreign countries. We have customers waiting in the Middle East but I don't have the money to file our patents, so we can't sell to them.
 The second thing is, we need to be a direct television product. Instant-Off is a very visual product, and we're just about ready to finish our first commercial. We need money, between $50,000 and $100,000, to advertise Instant-Off in 15 to 20 markets, five times a day. I've already met with the people at Wal-Mart. They love our product. They said, ''It works right within our sustainability program, and we want to start carrying more products made in the U.S. But unless you advertise on TV, no one's going to know about your product.''
 Q. What did you think of the president's answer to your question?
 A. [Sighs deeply.] I think he answered the best he could based on what he knows to be true. His knowledge of what is happening and what my personal experience is are different. I've met with the S.B.A. people, and I know how competent they are. And he says they don't have enough people to make loans directly. I appreciate the fact that he's earmarking $30 billion for small business, but it's not enough. How much of that is going to be loaned out? I know he really cares, and I know he's extremely smart. But he doesn't have the insight like I have. I'm in it, living it every day, and I'm struggling. And if he spent 20 or 30 minutes talking to me, he'd come away with the specifics he's missing.
 Q. Did you give your information to the president's ''body man,'' Reggie Love, like he asked?
 A. I started walking down toward the podium, and a very serious woman in a trench coat -- a Secret Service lady -- came up to me and said, [affecting a low voice] ''Are you Steve Gordon?'' Normally I would completely deny knowing that guy -- 
 Q. Well, sure, given your history --
 A. [Laughs.] Right. But I said, ''sure,'' and she said, ''I need all your company information.'' And she talked into her sleeve and said, ''I found him.''
 Q. What's been the reaction from banks since you asked the question?
 A. It's been really good. I have a bank meeting this afternoon, from a bank that called me and said they want to help. And then I talked to someone yesterday who said he's on the board of directors of a community bank, and I've got a meeting with them on Friday. I got another call from an investment banker who wants to meet me Thursday. So I did get three calls from banks.
 And I had 15 or 20 calls from across the country from businessmen that called just out of the blue to thank me for asking the question.

HEADLINE: Microsoft's Creative Destruction

BYLINE: By DICK BRASS. 
Dick Brass was a vice president at Microsoft from 1997 to 2004.

 BODY:
San Juan Island, Wash.
 AS they marvel at Apple's new iPad tablet computer, the technorati seem to be focusing on where this leaves Amazon's popular e-book business. But the much more important question is why Microsoft, America's most famous and prosperous technology company, no longer brings us the future, whether it's tablet computers like the iPad, e-books like Amazon's Kindle, smartphones like the BlackBerry and iPhone, search engines like Google, digital music systems like iPod and iTunes or popular Web services like Facebook and Twitter.
 Some people take joy in Microsoft's struggles, as the popular view in recent years paints the company as an unrepentant intentional monopolist. Good riddance if it fails. But those of us who worked there know it differently. At worst, you can say it's a highly repentant, largely accidental monopolist. It employs thousands of the smartest, most capable engineers in the world. More than any other firm, it made using computers both ubiquitous and affordable. Microsoft's Windows operating system and Office applications suite still utterly rule their markets. 
 The company's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, has continued to deliver huge profits. They totaled well over $100 billion in the past 10 years alone and help sustain the economies of Seattle, Washington State and the nation as a whole. Its founder, Bill Gates, is not only the most generous philanthropist in history, but has also inspired thousands of his employees to give generously themselves. No one in his right mind should wish Microsoft failure.
 And yet it is failing, even as it reports record earnings. As the fellow who tried (and largely failed) to make tablet PCs and e-books happen at Microsoft a decade ago, I could say this is because the company placed too much faith in people like me. But the decline is so broad and so striking that it would be presumptuous of me to take responsibility for it.
 Microsoft has become a clumsy, uncompetitive innovator. Its products are lampooned, often unfairly but sometimes with good reason. Its image has never recovered from the antitrust prosecution of the 1990s. Its marketing has been inept for years; remember the 2008 ad in which Bill Gates was somehow persuaded to literally wiggle his behind at the camera? 
 While Apple continues to gain market share in many products, Microsoft has lost share in Web browsers, high-end laptops and smartphones. Despite billions in investment, its Xbox line is still at best an equal contender in the game console business. It first ignored and then stumbled in personal music players until that business was locked up by Apple. 
 Microsoft's huge profits -- $6.7 billion for the past quarter -- come almost entirely from Windows and Office programs first developed decades ago. Like G.M. with its trucks and S.U.V.'s, Microsoft can't count on these venerable products to sustain it forever. Perhaps worst of all, Microsoft is no longer considered the cool or cutting-edge place to work. There has been a steady exit of its best and brightest.
 What happened? Unlike other companies, Microsoft never developed a true system for innovation. Some of my former colleagues argue that it actually developed a system to thwart innovation. Despite having one of the largest and best corporate laboratories in the world, and the luxury of not one but three chief technology officers, the company routinely manages to frustrate the efforts of its visionary thinkers.
 For example, early in my tenure, our group of very clever graphics experts invented a way to display text on screen called ClearType. It worked by using the color dots of liquid crystal displays to make type much more readable on the screen. Although we built it to help sell e-books, it gave Microsoft a huge potential advantage for every device with a screen. But it also annoyed other Microsoft groups that felt threatened by our success. 
 Engineers in the Windows group falsely claimed it made the display go haywire when certain colors were used. The head of Office products said it was fuzzy and gave him headaches. The vice president for pocket devices was blunter: he'd support ClearType and use it, but only if I transferred the program and the programmers to his control. As a result, even though it received much public praise, internal promotion and patents, a decade passed before a fully operational version of ClearType finally made it into Windows.
 Another example: When we were building the tablet PC in 2001, the vice president in charge of Office at the time decided he didn't like the concept. The tablet required a stylus, and he much preferred keyboards to pens and thought our efforts doomed. To guarantee they were, he refused to modify the popular Office applications to work properly with the tablet. So if you wanted to enter a number into a spreadsheet or correct a word in an e-mail message, you had to write it in a special pop-up box, which then transferred the information to Office. Annoying, clumsy and slow. 
 So once again, even though our tablet had the enthusiastic support of top management and had cost hundreds of millions to develop, it was essentially allowed to be sabotaged. To this day, you still can't use Office directly on a Tablet PC. And despite the certainty that an Apple tablet was coming this year, the tablet group at Microsoft was eliminated.
 Not everything that has gone wrong at Microsoft is due to internecine warfare. Part of the problem is a historic preference to develop (highly profitable) software without undertaking (highly risky) hardware. This made economic sense when the company was founded in 1975, but now makes it far more difficult to create tightly integrated, beautifully designed products like an iPhone or TiVo. And, yes, part of the problem has been an understandable caution in the wake of the antitrust settlement. Timing has also been poor -- too soon on Web TV, too late on iPods. 
 Internal competition is common at great companies. It can be wisely encouraged to force ideas to compete. The problem comes when the competition becomes uncontrolled and destructive. At Microsoft, it has created a dysfunctional corporate culture in which the big established groups are allowed to prey upon emerging teams, belittle their efforts, compete unfairly against them for resources, and over time hector them out of existence. It's not an accident that almost all the executives in charge of Microsoft's music, e-books, phone, online, search and tablet efforts over the past decade have left.
 As a result, while the company has had a truly amazing past and an enviably prosperous present, unless it regains its creative spark, it's an open question whether it has much of a future.

HEADLINE: Sales at Major Retailers Increased 3.3% in January

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Most of the nation's major chain stores began the year on the right foot, with retailers both high-end and low posting better results than a year ago. 
 On Thursday, popular stores like Macy's, Aeropostale and Gap raised their earnings forecasts after reporting their January sales. Luxury chains like Neiman Marcus and Saks -- among the retailers hurt most by the recession -- posted strong results. Even Abercrombie & Fitch, which for months had been turning in the worst results of any ubiquitous chain, fared well, mainly because of gift card redemptions. 
 According to Thomson Reuters, the retail sector collectively posted its strongest results since April 2008 -- a 3.3 percent sales increase at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales. In January 2009, retailers had a 5.6 percent decline in same-store sales after a brutal holiday shopping season. 
 January, a clearance month, is relatively unimportant compared with the back-to-school and Christmas seasons. Indeed, much of what shoppers bought was on sale, and many used gift cards to buy what they would not pay for out of their own pockets. Unemployment -- which weighs heavily on consumer spending -- remains high. 
 ''At this point, everyone has a friend or family member who still does not have a job,'' said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters. 
 Retailing analysts said last month's results looked good largely because they were being compared with the weak results of January 2009, not necessarily because consumer sentiment had turned a corner. Even so, January marked the fifth consecutive month of positive same-store sales after months of sharp declines. 
 Michael P. Niemira, chief economist and director of research for the International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry group, said in a news release that January's results were ''an impressive gain.'' Also, retailers most likely had better profit margins because they did not have to discount as radically as last year.
 Same-store sales increased at upscale chains like Saks (up 7 percent) and the specialty retail segment of Neiman Marcus, which includes Neiman Marcus stores and Bergdorf Goodman, (up 4.5 percent). Sales at Nordstrom, which sells merchandise at a wider range of prices than Saks and Neiman Marcus, climbed 14 percent year over year. 
 While it appears consumers are buying clothing again, they are careful what they pay. 
 ''Consumers are still trading down,'' Ms. Martis said, ''even though they are shopping for apparel, they are still looking for a value.'' 
 That's true even at high-end retailers, she said, noting that Saks benefited from clearance sales and that Nordstrom's strategy of introducing some lower-priced merchandise paid off. 
 With consumers parsing their dollars, discounters continued to do well. Same-store sales increased year over year at BJ's Wholesale Club (up 8.4 percent), Costco (up 8 percent) and Target (up 0.5 percent). Target was among chains that said its sales growth would have been higher were it not for its lean clearance inventory levels. (Wal-Mart does not report monthly results.) 
 Clothing stores that sell designer brands at a discount also thrived amid the frugality. TJX Companies, which owns the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, posted a 12 percent same-store sales increase. A rival, Ross Stores, had an 8 percent increase over a year ago. 
 Next to drugstores, department stores were January's worst-performing sector, according to Thomson Reuters. Same-store sales declined at Dillard's (5 percent), J. C. Penney (4.6 percent) and Stein Mart (2.5 percent). On the bright side, sales increased 6.5 percent at Kohl's, 5.3 percent at Bon-Ton, and 3.4 percent at Macy's. Macy's, which beat analysts' expectations, said sales at its higher-priced unit, Bloomingdale's, were also strong. 
 Most retailers that cater to children and teenagers reported robust same-store sales, with year-over-year increases at Children's Place (up 12 percent), American Eagle Outfitters (up 10 percent), Limited Brands and Aeropostale (both up 6 percent), Gap (up 5 percent) and Zumiez (up 1.8 percent). 
 Sales at Abercrombie & Fitch jumped 8 percent, its first increase since May 2008, according to Thomson Reuters. ''They came in with the biggest surprise,'' said Ms. Martis, noting that analysts thought the chain would post an 8.4 percent sales decline. Abercrombie's results, she said, speak ''volumes about the power of the gift card.'' 
 The exceptions in that sector were Hot Topic (down 13.1 percent), Wet Seal (down 3.7 percent) and Buckle -- which had been on a tear until now -- (down 1.2 percent). 
 American Apparel no longer reports monthly sales and, beginning next month, Children's Place will also stop posting monthly sales. 
 The International Council of Shopping Centers said on Thursday that February same-store sales were likely to increase about 2 percent because they would be compared to the weak sales of February 2009 and because of an improving economy.

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
A minimalist setup delivers maximum fright in ''Frozen,'' a nifty little chiller that balances its cold terrain with an unexpectedly warm heart.
 The location is a downscale New England ski resort, where three friends (Emma Bell, Kevin Zegers and Shawn Ashmore) are enjoying a weekend getaway. Eager for one last, ill-advised run before the slopes close for the week -- night has fallen, and bad weather is approaching -- the three are irritated when the chairlift grinds to a halt midway to their destination. 
Their irritation rapidly turns to terror when they discover that frostbite, hypothermia and needle-sharp hail pale in comparison with the dangers lurking beneath them. 
 Assembled with greater economy than a Ralph Nader presidential campaign, ''Frozen'' gains traction from a credible premise, above-average performances and the kind of modestly intuitive editing (by Ed Marx) that showcases the story and not itself. Between jolts, the writer and director, Adam Green, establishes a relatable emotional dynamic that never feels like filler, bringing us as close to the film's victims as time and the demands of genre allow.
 Filming entirely in Utah, the director proves himself judicious with gore if reckless with everyone's creature comforts. For Mr. Ashmore, the frigid high-wire shoot must have been particularly grueling: as Ice Man in ''X2: X-Men United,'' he probably learned never to underestimate the warm embrace of a studio -- and the painlessness of computer-generated frost. 
 ''Frozen'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). A peeking bra, a protruding bone and many gnashing teeth.
 FROZEN
 Opens on Friday nationwide. 
 Written and directed by Adam Green; director of photography, Will Barratt; edited by Ed Marx; music by Andy Garfield; production designer, Bryan A. McBrien; produced by Peter Block and Cory Neal; released by Anchor Bay Films. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes. 
 WITH: Emma Bell (Parker O'Neil), Shawn Ashmore (Joe Lynch), Kevin Zegers (Dan Walker), Ed Ackerman (Jason), Rileah Vanderbilt (Shannon) and Kane Hodder (Cody).

'FROM THE GOTHIC TRADITION TO THE EARLY RENAISSANCE'
 Moretti
 24 East 80th Street
 Manhattan
 Through Feb. 12
 These days an exhibition of early Renaissance panel paintings in a commercial gallery seems like a contradiction in terms. But at Moretti, which specializes in Tuscan painting of the 14th to the 16th centuries and has galleries in Florence and London as well as New York, you walk in the door, mount some stairs and suddenly you're caught in a very lively artistic crossfire. To one side, all is Byzantine flatness and formality and Gothic gold; to the other are early forays into spatial and emotional realism introduced into European art by Giotto. In nearly every instance, this contest unfolds as much within as among the paintings. 
 One of the most interesting aspects is simply the way the gold ranges back and forth between the ornamental and the pictorial, between flat halos, arched borders -- carefully punched with decorative patterns and, most frequently, bands of embroiderylike trim that follow the flow and folds of fabric. In a wonderful Madonna and Child enthroned with saints and angels by Jacopo di Cione, these uses combine with two others: the heavy-duty, relieflike decoration of a bishop's miter and cloak, and most seductive, gold patterned textiles and garments. 
 This effect is achieved with unusually overt physical directness by scratching foliate lines into black or orange paint to reveal the underlying gold. In the same spirit are the stringed instruments held by two angels in the foreground, for which the wood panel has been left bare and inscribed with a few identifying details, including strings. 
 In an even smaller exquisite panel, undoubtedly used in private devotion, the gold is integrated more completely into the checked carpet covering the steps leading to an enthroned Madonna and Child by the great Giovanni di Paolo, whose work is so plentiful at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The image is notable for the tufted hair-dos (fur? feathers?) of its kneeling angels and the tenderness between mother and child. 
 Also evident among the works is the introduction of Giotto-esque indications of landscape -- boxy palisades of stone tucked into backgrounds -- and the way artists developed them. The elements achieve monumentality with the awkward tilting plane that cuts through the center of a Nativity by Scolaio di Giovanni, supposedly a white hillside with a cave where the requisite donkey glares at the requisite ox.
 But convincing realism is achieved in the seemingly endless vista visible through an open arch in a Nativity with St. Jerome by Pietro di Francesco Orioli. It boasts atmospheric recession, distant mountains and a wealth of crisscrossing rivers, making sure that we don't overlook the artist's achievement. Go for the gold, stay for the view. ROBERTA SMITH 
 'VENICE'
 'Three Visions in Glass'
 Barry Friedman
 515 West 26th Street
 Chelsea
 Through Feb. 13 
 The pitfalls lurking in the gap between art and craft are tellingly, if inadvertently illuminated in side-by-side exhibitions of three artists who work in glass in Venice, the European city most continuously associated over the centuries with this astounding material. 
 Cristiano Bianchin, an Italian artist born in 1963, combines glass with fiber, wood and metal in works ranging from vessels to life-size figures laid out as if in ancient burial. The cultural references touch on African, Egyptian, French Art Deco and bad 1970s figuration. The overall impression is of a so-so group show of overly exquisite objects. 
 Laura de Santillana, also Italian (born 1955), is more purely modernist in ambition. Her display begins with a gallery lined with elegant, rectangular vessels of clear glass layered with one or two rectangles of intense, but diaphanous color -- Rothkos by way of Sephora. In a second space, she shifts to floor installations involving smooth, luminous gourdlike forms or dark, rippled meteorlike orbs that would probably not draw a glance under the heading contemporary sculpture. They might be the early, early work of Anish Kapoor. 
 The artist who seems most committed to the traditions and possibilities of glass-making itself is Yoichi Ohira, who was born in Japan in 1946. Some of his vases push the ancient technique of multicolored glass canes to new extremes of intricacy and jewel-like chromatic richness. But he also works purely and simply, creating thick-walled vessels with carved exteriors and interiors that resemble suspended bubbles. 
 Mr. Ohira's pieces seem aimed to please a great range of tastes and I doubt that it is possible to like everything he does. But I wager that visitors will spend most of their time with his objects. They reward the eye, exploit their medium and are not preoccupied with crossing over to the category of fine art, which greatly enhances their chances of doing so. ROBERTA SMITH

HEADLINE: Indianapolis Mayor Reflects His City and Its Team

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. 

 BODY:
 Mayor Greg Ballard of Indianapolis was expected to arrive in Miami on Thursday evening. His arrival may come as a shock to some here who thought Indianapolis didn't have a mayor. 
 In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, C. Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, became the national face of the city and its recovery efforts. Ballard, who was elected in 2007, said his mission in South Florida was to spread the good news of Indianapolis and to wrestle away some of the attention from Nagin.
 ''I know that people, because of Katrina, know Mayor Nagin a little bit more,'' he said. ''That's fine. I absolutely understand the sympathy angle, and I do wish them well.'' 
 We know why we should care about the Saints. We've been beaten over the head with it. The Saints are an underdog lover's dream, too great a story to pass up. Players talk on automatic pilot about the post-Katrina devastation. A city practically under water, making its way back. An N.F.L. team that had been an N.F.L. disaster, reaching the Super Bowl for the first time.
 O.K. We get it. 
 But beyond rooting interests, why should we care about Indianapolis? Why care about the Colts? There is no devastation, no disaster. In fact, Ballard said the city's economy was ''holding its own.''
 ''Because of the diversity of the economy, Indiana is doing a little better than most,'' he said. As a franchise, the Colts have been one of the most successful teams of the decade. So why should we care? 
 Because in an era of bells and whistles, there is something to be said for simplicity and efficiency. Indianapolis is a big city with a small-town feel, a family-oriented city. One or two cities may be more exciting hosts, but none do it better. There are more combustible football teams, but none in the last 11 years have been as consistently excellent as the Colts. 
 Indianapolis is hosting the men's Final Four this spring. The N.F.L. combine makes Indianapolis its home, and the city will host the Super Bowl in 2012. This is no Mardi Gras city, and the Colts are not a Mardi Gras team. 
 ''We do the big things right,'' Ballard said.
 While Nagin became a national celebrity because of Katrina, Ballard has remained anonymous. That is beginning to change. 
 If Nagin is the face of New Orleans, Ballard, 55, is the spirit of Indianapolis.
 He was raised in the city, where he attended an all-boys Catholic school. He also grew up without the N.F.L. The city did not have a team until the Colts relocated from Baltimore in 1984.
 ''Everybody was a Chicago Bears fan,'' he said. Not Ballard. 
 ''As hard as this is to believe,'' he said, ''I was a Colts fan. My favorite player was Raymond Berry. I loved him because he was so precise in how he did his work.'' 
 Berry was a self-made player, much like his quarterback, Johnny Unitas, who played semipro football before working his way up. ''I like those kinds of stories,'' he said. ''Not only Indianapolis, but all of Indiana appreciates somebody who just does the work, does it for the right reasons. 
 ''You can't just win in Indiana. You're going to have to win the right way to get full support. They do things the right way. Hard work, they do things smartly, they give back to the community. They bring the city together. In any city there are differences, but when the Colts play, all the differences seem to be cast aside and everybody is just cheering for the Colts pretty strongly.''
 Ballard attended Indiana University, where he earned a degree in economics. Instead of going into the workaday world, he joined the Marines. His parents were speechless. 
 ''They were shocked,'' Ballard said. ''I came from a nonmilitary family; they never saw it coming.''
 Ballard joined because he didn't want to fall into a daily grind. ''At that time, I saw everybody graduating,'' he said. ''They looked like they went to work for a company for 40 years. They'd take two weeks off a year, spend two weeks of vacation in Florida. I didn't see myself doing that for the next 40 years. I just wanted something different. You can't get much different than the Marines.''
 Ballard retired from the Marines in 2001 as a lieutenant colonel after a 23-year career that included a tour in the first Gulf War and several commendations. He said he wanted to be with his two children, who were beginning their first and second years of high school. In 2007, after working in the private sector, he decided to run for mayor. No established Republican wanted to take on the two-term incumbent Bart Peterson. 
 Despite being an overwhelming underdog, Ballard won. His victory was called the most stunning upset in the history of Indiana politics. 
 The lesson learned -- one he has applied to this Super Bowl -- is that you cut through all the hype, ignore the press clippings. You run the race and play the game.
 The New Orleans Saints have become America's team, a team of destiny.
 ''There is some of that, and frankly, I understand that fully,'' Ballard said. ''But at the end of the day, when they get on the field, all of that stops. I think the Colts are a team on a mission this year. I think they're going to be very difficult to stop.''
 No flash. No dash. The Colts are just good.
 Sunday may very well be a reality check for ''Who Dat'' nation.

HEADLINE: Filings for Jobless Claims Rise Unexpectedly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off workers filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose unexpectedly last week, the Labor Department said Thursday.
 And a second report by the Labor Department showed that people with jobs worked harder in the fourth quarter. 
 In the jobless filings report, the agency said that new claims for unemployment insurance rose by 8,000, to a seasonally adjusted 480,000. Wall Street economists had expected a drop to 460,000. The rise is the fourth in the last five weeks. Most economists had hoped that claims would resume the downward trend that was evident in the fall and early winter. 
 The four-week average, which smoothes fluctuations, rose for the third consecutive week, to 468,750.
 The figure is the highest in the last two months. 
 The Labor Department is scheduled to report the January employment figures, which are expected to show a tiny gain in jobs, on Friday. The unemployment rate is forecast to stay at 10 percent.
 The number of people continuing to claim benefits was unchanged at 4.6 million. That data lags initial claims by a week.
 But the so-called continuing claims do not include millions of people who have used up the regular 26 weeks of benefits typically provided by states, and are receiving extended benefits for up to 73 additional weeks, paid for by the federal government.
 More than 5.8 million people were receiving extended benefits in the week ended Jan. 16, the latest data available, up from about 5.6 million the previous week. The extended benefit data isn't seasonally adjusted and is volatile from week to week.
 Still, the increasing number of people claiming extended unemployment insurance indicates hiring has not picked up. 
 Among the states, Oregon reported the largest increase in claims, with 4,336. Puerto Rico and Hawaii also reported increases. The state data lags initial claims by one week.
 California reported the largest drop in claims, a decline of 22,674. Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia and Missouri also reported decreases.
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said that worker productivity rose more than expected in the fourth quarter as companies squeezed more output from their employees.
 Productivity rose by a seasonally adjusted 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, above analysts' expectations of a 6 percent rise.
 The increase follows two quarters of sharply rising productivity. Over all, productivity has risen 5.1 percent in the last four quarters, the most since the 12 months that ended with the first quarter of 2002.
 Productivity often rises at the end of recessions as companies ramp up output before hiring new workers. Rising productivity can raise living standards in the long run. But it can also make it easier for companies to postpone hiring.

HEADLINE: Sony Returns to a Profit And Raises Its Outlook

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
After several quarters of losses, Sonysaid Thursday that it had returned to profit during the last three months of 2009 and raised its outlook, providing the latest evidence of how the global economic recovery was filtering through to corporate earnings. 
 The Japanese electronics and entertainment giant -- maker of the PlayStation game console, Bravia TV and Cyber-shot digital cameras -- was buffeted by the sharp global economic downturn last year and still expects a net loss for the financial year that ends March 31.
 But the full-year shortfall will now probably be 70 billion yen ($770 million), Sony said Thursday, rather than the 95 billion yen it had projected last October, when much of the world was still struggling to emerge from the economic slowdown.
 Results released recently for the three months through December from various companies -- including Hitachi and Lenovo on Thursday -- have shown that corporate earnings improved at the end of last year. The earnings news provides more evidence that the global economy is now on a gradual path to recovery, albeit a feeble and brittle one in Japan, the United States and Europe.
 Sony, whose sheer size makes it a closely watched barometer for the consumer electronics sector, has also closed several factories, eliminated thousands of jobs and made deep cuts in capital spending and research and development expenditures in a bid to reduce costs by 330 billion yen this year.
 Earnings for the third quarter, Sony said in its announcement, ''significantly exceeded expectations.'' Sony's net profit for the quarter was at 79.2 billion yen, up from 10.4 billion yen a year earlier.
 Operating profit improved to 146 billion yen, from a loss of 18 billion yen in the same quarter a year earlier.
 The consumer products and devices division, which includes products like LCD televisions, camcorders and broadcasting equipment, did far better than analysts had expected, with an operating income of 49.4 billion yen, compared with a loss of 19.8 billion yen a year earlier.
 At a briefing in Tokyo, Nobuyuki Oneda, Sony's chief financial officer, said price pressures for TVs -- where the company faces fierce competition from other manufacturers like Samsung -- had not been as bad as expected in December.
 TV sales in January, he added, had been a little bit higher than expected, and would probably be about the same or a little bit better than expected in February and March.
 A slightly weaker yen is also helping Japanese exporters like Sony. The company said Thursday that it expected the Japanese currency to average about 90 yen a dollar in the January-March quarter, the last of its financial year, unchanged from its last projection in October. During the quarter that ended Dec. 31, the average rate of the yen was 88.7 yen to the dollar.

HEADLINE: Illinois Court Overturns Malpractice Statute

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
In a case that could resonate in Washington, the Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday overturned the state's five-year-old medical malpractice law because it limited compensation to injured patients for pain, suffering and other non-economic harms.
 The ruling came down as federal proposals to cap malpractice awards are receiving fresh attention on Capitol Hill. Republicans enthusiastically support the limits, and they are seen as a potential vehicle for restarting the stalled health care negotiations in Congress with bipartisan impetus. Neither the House bill that Democrats passed late last year nor its Senate counterpart included significant changes to medical malpractice regulations. 
 In a 4-to-2 ruling, the Illinois court wrote that the legislature, in enacting the 2005 law, violated the state Constitution's separation of powers clause by imposing decisions that should be reserved for judges and juries. The law established caps of $500,000 for non-economic damages in verdicts against doctors and $1 million in cases against hospitals.
 The decision armed opponents of such provisions with fresh ammunition, and held a particular sting for the American Medical Association, which has its headquarters in Chicago. 
 A statement from the American Association for Justice, formerly the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, said the decision illustrated ''why federal efforts to place arbitrary limits on the amount injured patients receive won't pass muster or fix America's broken health care system.'' Nearly 30 states have laws that limit non-economic damages, although the caps and circumstances for imposing them vary widely. According to the American Medical Association, courts in 16 states have upheld the laws, while those in 11 states have overturned them.
 Some of those 11 states have, in turn, passed new laws that seek to satisfy the courts' objections. In Illinois, the State Supreme Court had twice before struck down laws setting caps on damages in tort cases. The most recent law was enacted to stem a perceived flow of doctors from the state, and in some cases from the profession, because of their inability to afford escalating malpractice insurance premiums.
 The state medical society argues that the law has been effective, citing insurance industry figures that show declines in both the number of malpractice claims filed and the cost of premiums. 
 The court's decision ''threatens to undo all that Illinois patients and physicians have gained under the cap, including greater access to health care, lower medical liability rates and increased competition among medical liability insurers,'' the American Medical Association president, Dr. J. James Rohack, said. The court's majority, Dr. Rohack added, had ''superseded the will of the people.''
 In a dissent, Justice Lloyd Karmeier used the health care debate in Washington, and President Obama's occasional nods toward malpractice reform, as a backdrop for arguing that legislatures were within their rights to cap damages.
 The decision came in the case of Abigaile Lebron, who suffered severe mental impairment during her birth by Caesarean section four years ago. That case is in the discovery phase.
 The ruling invalidated a host of changes made in conjunction with a cap on damages, including a measure that made apologies by doctors for bad outcomes inadmissible as evidence in malpractice cases.
 One of the girl's lawyers, Robert S. Peck, said he did not think the legislature would be able to rewrite the malpractice statute to satisfy the court's concerns.
 ''This is a pretty definitive decision that says this is not within the purview of the legislature at all,'' Mr. Peck said, ''so we're thinking this will have some impact.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Your Inner Federer, If the Muscles (Groan!) Allow

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

DATELINE: Wesley Chapel, Fla. 

 BODY:
 TECHNICAL commands were sprayed with the same tormenting frequency as the fluffy yellow balls: ''Move your feet ... racket back ...turn ... turn ... turn!''
 A tangential pop quiz was sprung: ''Who adapted the song from the Book of Ecclesiastes?'' 
 I didn't turn enough, bounced a forehand into the net and scampered back to the center of the court. ''Dylan?'' I gasped, while bending to touch the strategically placed cone on the service line with my racket.
 ''No, Pete Seeger,'' my instructor said. My punishment was another ball into the corner.
 The Florida morning was postcard perfect, not a cloud in sight, humidity low, the nearby pool mostly empty and inviting. I was a two-day prisoner of Stephen Getchell's group in the Saddlebrook Resort's adult tennis program and of my own athletic vanity. 
 Not for the first time in such a vacation-land setting, I had volunteered for the privilege of being drilled five exhausting hours a day, of having my game deconstructed stroke by stroke, with all the axiomatic hectoring -- ''Coil to uncoil!'' -- that was not conceived with the 57-year-old body in mind.
 A fair question, I suppose, is why? Because after 30 years of trying to release my inner Agassi, I have come to accept who I am as a recreational tennis player. Alas, during my first three-hour session with Mr. Getchell, with only one other group member -- a doctor, what luck! -- I discovered that in all likelihood I am not even at the level I thought I was.
 ''What's your rating?'' Mr. Getchell asked, referring to the statistical measure of a player's ability.
 ''I think, like, 3.5.''
 ''Well, maybe in New Jersey you are,'' he said. ''This is Florida. If you were to play a 3.5 here, you'd be beaten like a rented mule.''
 Mr. Getchell wasn't being unkind, merely glib, while reminding me that Florida is to tennis what Nevada is to gambling. Most families dreaming of Wimbledon riches or a college scholarship dispatch their ground-stroking progeny to a youth academy like the one at Saddlebrook or the IMG Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton. Many professionals live in Florida; in my two days at Saddlebrook I was reminded a half-dozen times that the American pro John Isner trains at the facility, which has 45 courts, including grass and red clay.
 From the many adult camp choices, my wife, Beth Albert, and I chose Saddlebrook, 30 miles north of the Tampa airport, with condominium lodging, a pool, spa and restaurants. There are two Arnold Palmer-designed golf courses, but I don't play -- my symbolic resistance to middle-age concession. I am thrilled to still be bouncing (some) on my toes, working up a fast sweat. Mr. Getchell, 41, was impressed by my quickness, the one part of my game he actually rated a Floridian's 3.5.
 During the tennis boom years of the 1970s and '80s the sport was typically promoted as a game for life, which many baby boomers grew to lament as a life of aches, pains and risk of blowing out a knee. Golf not only became a safer alternative but a trendier one too, once Tiger Woods brought new-age athleticism to the P.G.A. Tour. 
 There were holdouts, of course, like Doug Shear, who visits Saddlebrook twice a year and was stretched out by the pool after the morning session with a body that appeared to have not consumed a single doughnut in its 58 years. The look was misleading. Mr. Shear -- a home-construction contractor in Middletown, R.I. -- had a hip replacement 10 years ago following a motorcycle accident. Three weeks before he flew to Tampa, a metal plate that was inserted after surgery to treat spinal stenosis was removed from his neck.
 The procedure was minor, he said, but he reduced the length of his stay from five days to two. That was his compromise, less tennis, the closest he said he will ever get to a round of golf.
 ''I always say tennis is a sport, golf is an activity,'' Mr. Shear said. ''The best way I can put it is that if you take the best amateur golfer in the country on his best day, he can keep up with Tiger Woods. But if you take the best amateur tennis player in the country on his best day, there is no way he can play with Roger Federer.''
 According to a recent survey by the Taylor Research and Consulting Group for the United States Tennis Association and the Tennis Industry Association, tennis has experienced a recreational upswing across all age groups, especially among blacks and Hispanics. This year participation in the country rose above 30 million for the first time in more than two decades. Between 2003 and 2008, before the recession, youth racket sales rose by 50 percent .
 ''If you look at the people playing professional tennis, they are fit, they are healthy and they are good looking,'' Jolyn de Boer, the executive director of the Tennis Industry Association, said in a telephone interview. That most of the current stars, with the exception of the Williams sisters, are not Americans counters the notion of another boom in the United States. But there is no question that the sport has crashed a perception barrier. Advancements in racket technology along with bigger, stronger and fitter players have created a ferocious brand of shot-making and recast tennis as more macho, hipper, no longer the essence of country-club chic.
 ''When you look at how hard the ball is being hit, the level of athleticism and skill that's required just to return it, you can understand why kids would be more attracted to it,'' said Howard Moore, Saddlebrook's tennis director. 
 Can't speak for the young ones, but I will venture to say that Mr. Federer, Rafael Nadal and company have become the pride of graying boomers who didn't lay down their rackets, who cling to an action sport and will pay good money for the grind of adult boot camp, motivational taunts and all.
 Mr. Getchell was seldom at a loss. As more ground strokes went awry on the morning of Day 2, he reminded me: ''There is no such thing as a bad ball feed, only bad footwork.'' The hard evidence was soon presented for my viewing displeasure.
 At Saddlebrook everyone has a private video session with Nona Wagh, the adult program director, a former college player from Mumbai, India. Warning to long-time players and first-time campers: This can be jarring. Was that really me, hitting forehands and backhands with my racket drooping on its follow-through like water-starved vegetation and stiffly moving forward to drop flat-footed volleys into the net?
 Never have I fancied myself as Mr. Federer, the master of fluidity and the holder of a record 16 Grand Slam titles, but I certainly thought I was more athletic looking than the imposter on screen. At Ms. Wagh's suggestion I dismissed it as camera fright and chided myself to move my body and feet when I returned to the court. 
 By the end of my stay Mr. Getchell did manage to eliminate the hitch in my serve, and in a private session Mr. Moore had me confidently smacking my normally timid backhand. But when I returned home and put it to the test of doubles match play the next day, I resumed slicing or pushing the ball back and hating myself for being a wimp. 
 As a relatively new player my wife is still at the point of believing that one or two pieces of technical advice will unlock the game's competitive mysteries. I will no doubt be a New Jersey 3.5 until my body begs to differ. And that's the whole point. The real satisfaction of adult tennis camp is rooted not so much in self-improvement but in self-actualization. Why do we subject ourselves to it? Because we still can.
 Saddlebrook Resort (saddlebrook.com; 800-729-8383) is in Wesley Chapel, Fla., 30 miles north of Tampa International Airport, one mile east of Interstate 75 at Exit 279. Transportation to and from the resort can be arranged for a fee by reservation. The resort offers tennis and golf packages for adults and juniors and guarantees no more than four players in a group. Rates are seasonal. There are also packages for spa and fitness treatments. 
 WHERE TO EAT:
 Although there are a variety of family restaurants in the area, the resort offers options: Dempsey's Steak House has a costly menu but a well-stocked salad bar available along with lighter fare at the adjacent T D's Sports Bar. TropicsRestaurant and Lounge at Saddlebrook offers a varied and more affordable lunch and dinner menu and is where breakfast (which is included) is served. There is also a poolside cafe and bar.
 WHAT TO DO:
 Saddlebrook is a short drive from a number of family amusement parks like Busch Gardens and Adventure Island, and it is a 90-minute drive from the Orlando theme parks. Baseball spring-training workouts and exhibition games are available during February and March, including the New York Yankees at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa. Gulf beaches are about a one-hour drive from the resort.

HEADLINE: American Charged in Haiti Had Some Troubles in Idaho

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY; Toby Lyles contributed research.

DATELINE: MERIDIAN, Idaho 

 BODY:
The leader of the group of Americans charged on Thursday with abducting children in Haiti is an Idaho businesswoman with a complicated financial history that involves complaints from employees over unpaid wages, state liens on a company bank account and lawsuits in small claims court.
 The leader, Laura Silsby, defaulted last July on the mortgage on a house in an unfinished subdivision here in Meridian, a suburb of Boise, according to the Ada County Tax Assessor's Office. Yet in November, Ms. Silsby registered a new nonprofit, the New Life Children's Refuge, at the address of the house, which she bought in 2008 for $358,000. 
 New Life Children's Refuge is the name of the orphanage Ms. Silsby and the nine other Americans charged in Haiti said they had planned to establish in the Dominican Republic. 
 Ms. Silsby lost the house in Meridian to foreclosure on Dec. 7, records show, and it now stands empty, with signs in the yard promoting a foreclosure sale.
 ''I get mail for her all the time,'' said LaChelle Bohner, who lives two doors down from the house. Ms. Bohner said the mail included collection notices.
 Ms. Silsby and her business, Personal Shopper, which provides shopping services for Internet customers, have faced multiple legal claims.
 According to state records and officials, Personal Shopper has been named 14 times in complaints from employees over unpaid wages. Among the reasons cited by the employees for having not been paid were ''no money for payroll'' and ''fully investor funded and investors have been hit hard by the economy.'' 
 Employees won nine of the cases, forcing Personal Shopper to pay nearly $31,000 in wages and $4,000 in fines. The Idaho Department of Labor initially put liens on a company bank account to get the money.
 ''They didn't like that so they said: 'How much do we owe? We'll pay it,' '' said Bob Fick, a spokesman for the department, adding that unpaid wage complaints were not uncommon. 
 State officials said Personal Shopper had paid all the wage claims upheld by the state. But another former employee has sued Personal Shopper in civil court. A jury trial is set for Feb. 22 over a claim by the employee, Robin Oliver, that Personal Shopper owes her more than $22,000.
 A lawyer for Ms. Silsby said Thursday that he could not comment on the case.
 One of the people awarded unpaid wages was Chris Holmes, who said he was not surprised that Ms. Silsby had run into trouble in Haiti. Mr. Holmes, who did database work, said Ms. Silsby often showed a ''lack of forethought,'' shifting business models to suit the investors who kept the company afloat. 
 ''She would come up with an idea on Wednesday, and on Friday there would be a new idea that was 180 degrees different,'' Mr. Holmes said.
 In 2006, Ms. Silsby received a Femtor Award for ''Businesswoman of the Year''; the awards are sponsored by the eWomenNetwork, a group that promotes women and their businesses. 
 Ms. Silsby, who has young children in Idaho, was divorced in 2007. She and her former husband lived in Meridian, but public records were not clear about where she currently resides.
 The offices of Personal Shopper, in an office park in Meridian, have been shuttered this week, with mail dating to at least last week stacked on the floor. 
 Clint Henry, pastor of Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, where five of the Americans charged in Haiti attend services, said Ms. Silsby had attended his church for about two years. 
 ''You wouldn't find any finer Christian people than these people,'' Mr. Henry said in an interview earlier this week.

HEADLINE: O! Say, You Can Bid On a Johns

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Here's a little-known art world fact: In addition to writing thrillers like ''The Andromeda Strain'' and ''Jurassic Park,'' creating television hits like ''ER'' and directing movies including ''Coma,'' Michael Crichton collected art, though he kept his purchases to himself. 
 ''I have never thought of myself as a serious art collector,'' Crichton, who died in November 2008, wrote in 1980. ''I have neither the knowledge, the devotion nor the dementia of the deeply committed collector.'' 
 On Friday at Christie's in London, the public will be able to see four works owned by Crichton that Christie's is to sell on behalf of his estate in New York at the evening auctions in May. 
 Top among them is Jasper Johns's seminal image ''Flag,'' 1960-66. The painting, which Crichton bought directly from Mr. Johns in 1974, was last seen in public 18 years ago when it was included in a Pop Art survey organized by the Royal Academy of Arts in London. 
 Crichton got to know most of the artists he collected, including David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg and Mr. Johns. Crichton and Mr. Johns met in the early 1970s and remained good friends. So good that Mr. Johns asked Crichton to write the catalog for a retrospective of his work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1977. 
 The painting that Christie's is selling is a particularly vibrant example of a Johns flag, in encaustic, an ancient technique in which pigment is suspended in wax, giving each brush stroke a distinct materiality. His flag paintings rarely come up for sale. Brett Gorvy, deputy chairman of Christie's America, said he was waiting to see the results of next week's auctions before putting estimates on any of the works. In 2006 David Geffen, the Hollywood mogul, sold another famous image of Mr. Johns's -- ''False Start'' (1959) -- to Kenneth C. Griffin, chief executive of the Chicago-based Citadel Investment Group, for $80 million.
 In addition to ''Flag'' the May sale will include ''Studio Painting,'' 1960-61, one of Rauschenberg's Combines, a term he coined for works in which he incorporated castoff objects like rubber tires, flatware or furniture; a Picasso painting, ''Femme et Fillettes'' (''Woman and Children'') from 1961; and Lichtenstein's ''Girl in Water,'' a collage and ink cartoon image from 1965. 
 THE MET GETS 'SALON'
 In 2003, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art opened ''The Dawn of Photography: French Daguerreotypes, 1839-1855,'' the first image visitors saw -- blown up to 10 feet at the entrance -- was of a perfectly composed interior of a mid-19th-century parlor. The image was also used on a poster for the exhibition. But at the time the picture, ''Baron Gros's Salon,'' did not belong to the Met. It was on loan from two Paris collectors, Marie-Therese and Andre Jammes. 
 For years curators at the Met wanted the image, the work of Baron Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros, a French diplomat who first learned photography while stationed in Bogota, Colombia, in the early 1840s and later perfected it in France. Gros became what Malcolm Daniel, the curator in charge of photography at the Met, called ''the supreme master of the daguerreotype in the country of its invention.'' 
 And this particular image -- from 1850-57 -- is thought to be the parlor of his home on the Rue Barbet-de-Jouy in Paris. The rich setting, with multiple patterns and textures of fabrics and objects, has at its center an easel full of photographs. The composition is made particularly dramatic by light streaming in from a sliver of a window. ''It's a self-portrait of his taste, talent and social status,'' Mr. Daniel said, ''an interior photograph of photographs.'' 
 By its very nature a daguerreotype -- in which an image is created on a polished silver-plated sheet of copper, sensitized with iodine and developed with mercury fumes -- is unique. There is no negative, nor are there prints. In 2008 ''Baron Gros's Salon'' appeared at a Sotheby's auction, at which Serge Plantureux, a Paris dealer, snapped it up for $271,684. A year later, in November, he turned around and put it up for sale at a small French auction house. But the $350,000 to $500,000 estimate was too high, and it failed to sell. 
 That was good news for the Met, which had been quietly tracking the image since the exhibition. ''We had the right of first refusal for it, in the event that it wasn't sold at auction,'' Mr. Daniel said. The museum was able to buy it from Mr. Plantureux. ''It's now our most important daguerreotype,'' Mr. Daniel said, adding that he plans to put it on view later this year. 
 KANSAS CITY RICHES
 Despite the difficult economy, passionate philanthropists in places like Dallas, Seattle and now Kansas City, Mo., have quietly been promising major works of art to their local museums. 
 This week the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City announced that 75 of its supporters have either given or promised to give some 400 works of art to celebrate the museum's 75th anniversary and to honor its veteran director, Marc F. Wilson, who is retiring in June. 
 ''This is about the future,'' said Sarah Rowland, chairwoman of the Nelson-Atkins board. ''Kansas City may be small but it has a deep philanthropic base. And there are a lot of people who care deeply about their community.'' 
 The range of gifts is broad: there's everything from paintings, drawings, prints and photographs to textiles, ceramics, silver, furniture and rare books. Capping it all is the Marion and Henry Bloch Collection of Impressionist and modern art, which includes 29 works by van Gogh, Manet, Monet, Cezanne and Gauguin that experts say are worth more than $300 million alone. In 2007 the museum named a building after the Blochs. (He was a founder of H&R Block.) Designed by the architect Steven Holl, it opened in 2007 with, appropriately enough, an exhibition of the Blochs' collection. 
 A selection of highlights of the gifts will be shown at the museum Feb. 13 through April 4. 
 MIDCAREER AWARDS
 Prizes in the art world generally favor the young and the hot, but the Ordway Prize is different. Administered by the New Museum in New York and Creative Link for the Arts (formerly the Penny McCall Foundation), the $100,000 award is given every two years to a midcareer artist and a midcareer arts writer. 
 This year's winners are Hamza Walker, a curator and writer who is the director of education and associate curator at the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago; and the Polish artist Artur Zmijewski, whose work has just been on view at the Museum of Modern Art in its Projects 91 series. (It closed Monday.) 
 ''These may not be stars of the commercial system,'' said Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, ''but they've been quietly and steadfastly working for years.'' 
 Named in honor of the art collector and Nature Conservancy founder Katherine Ordway, the great-great aunt of Jennifer McSweeney, director of Creative Link, the prize was conceived as the American equivalent to the Turner Prize in Britain.

HEADLINE: Kellogg Raises Annual Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Kellogg Company reported Thursday that higher costs and lower sales damped its fourth-quarter profit, but it said it had positioned itself for growth and raised its earnings expectations for the year. 
 Kelloggsaid it earned $176 million, or 46 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $179 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 1 percent to $2.90 billion, from $2.93 billion. 
 The income fell short of the 49 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, and shares of Kellogg fell $2.78, or 5 percent, to $52.41.
 Kellogg, which is based in Battle Creek, Mich., said strong sales of its cereal and snacks, particularly in North America, helped offset other business that slowed in the down economy.
 The chief executive, David Mackay said 2009 was difficult for the company, and tight consumer spending would continue to pose a challenge, particularly in North America and Europe, this year. But he said the company planned to make changes that would help it grow, including cutting costs, increasing advertising and developing new products.

HEADLINE: Amid Discontent and a Campaign, Schumer Draws Breath

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
The usually unavoidable-for-comment, if-it's-Sunday-here-is-my-press-release senior senator from New York is being a little tetchy about going on the record.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer has had a not-so-hot run recently. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg accused him of failing to deliver enough federal health care dollars for New York, and the city's titans of finance at a recent closed-door meeting accused him of being insufficiently pro-Wall Street; one indignant fellow stood up and demanded his donation back.
 Some Democrats whisper that he plays the too-aggressive kingmaker, shoving aside challengers to Kirsten E. Gillibrand, the appointed junior senator. And a recent Marist College poll suggested that Mr. Schumer's favorability ratings had leaked helium, falling to 47 percent. 
 Is this fatal to the senator as he seeks his third term? That seems highly, deeply, profoundly unlikely, even according to those same pollsters and to senior state Republicans, who prefer to place Ms. Gillibrand in their cross hairs for the fall of 2010. But a harsh wind is howling for incumbents, and Mr. Schumer, who has been running for office since just about the day he left Harvard, does not like talk of any Democrat's political mortality, particularly his own.
 So he carefully measures out his verbs and nouns for a reporter, trying not to say what he knows: It's been a rough year. 
 ''There was another poll this same week that had much different numbers, so you can't rely on polls,'' he says, striving for a studiously bland manner. 
 In truth, even Lee M. Miringhoff, head of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, agrees it is not the end. He has sifted the poll numbers and divines mostly agita for Mr. Schumer. 
 ''It's not the usual fluctuations, but neither do I think it puts him in electoral jeopardy,'' he said. ''It's more that it speaks to a lack of enthusiasm in his electoral base.''
 Still, for a man who might be the next Senate majority leader, and who is credited with masterminding the strategy that oh so briefly put 60 Democrats in the Senate, to see bubbles of discontent in his own state is a strange business. His Web site features a map of New York with green thumbtacks on towns he has visited in the last year, a virtual forest of green from Ogdensburg to Niagara Falls to Utica. In New York City he has appeared at 10 City Council installations, 5 firehouses, 7 schools, and so on and on.
 In his version of Where's Waldo, the answer is everywhere.
 Wall Street's current disaffection is intriguing, as Mr. Schumer served for 30 years as Horatio at the bridge, guarding against too many incursions against the financial industry. He artfully sidetracked an effort to tax hedge funds and pushed for repeal of legislation that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky investments like trading stocks or mortgage-backed securities. And he helped craft a bank-friendly bailout. In return, he has taken in more money from the securities and finance industry over the course of his career than any Democrat other than Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
 Of late, Mr. Schumer has put a little flannel in his pinstripe love. He favors an Obama administration proposal to tax large banks. He has spoken out about ''outrageous'' bank overdraft policies.
 So the prevailing mood on Wall Street is of wounded innocence: Et tu, Chuck? The Partnership for New York City, a plutocratic chamber of commerce, recently met with the senior senator. ''This disappointment was very high; he's walked away from our industry and that's unconscionable,'' said a member, who nonetheless did not feel so emboldened as to want to be identified.
 Mr. Schumer, by this account, took umbrage at their umbrage. Do you, he asked, really think it's better to be rhetorically pro-Wall Street or anti-Wall Street? Be realistic. Financial institutions did much wrong, he suggested, but cautioned against getting vindictive.
 ''Chuck has been a champion for our financial industry and for our state,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, the partnership's president. ''But it's a quarrel in the family with unrealizable expectations of unconditional love.''
 A few, including that fellow who rumbled about desertion, talked privately of funding a challenger to Mr. Schumer. As Mr. Schumer could become Senate majority leader, and therefore the third most powerful Democrat in the nation, such militancy struck others as daft. ''What are you going to do for a new king?'' asked one.
 Some have seized on a passive-aggressive way of torturing the senior senator. They want to finance a Democratic primary challenge by Harold E. Ford Jr., whom they happen to admire, to Senator Gillibrand, whose patron is Mr. Schumer. Mayor Bloomberg, who was not pleased that Ms. Gillibrand edged out his choice, Caroline Kennedy, appears not unopposed to this turn, as his former pollster and campaign manager are advising Mr. Ford.
 And yet, and yet, if Mr. Schumer were a racehorse, you'd be hard put to find anyone willing to place a bet on his losing. Republican leaders tend to view Lawrence Kudlow, the conservative television commentator and champion of Wall Street who has talked of running, as a highly verbal and entertaining lamb to the slaughter.
 And Park Avenue cannot offer a plurality to anyone. 
 ''Let me get this straight: The public is infuriated with the banks, so the way to beat Chuck Schumer is to run a right-wing, pro-Wall Street economist against him?'' said Bob Master, political director of District 1 of the Communications Workers of America.
 Mainly, primarily, Democrat after Democrat warned that questions about Mr. Schumer's putative weakness seem likely to accomplish but one thing: to push Mr. Schumer, whose love of press conferences and taste for the most remote corners of New York is inextinguishable, to travel and talk and travel even more.
 ''He has only one reaction to this stuff,'' says a former staffer with some evident affection, as well as relief that he no longer labors there. ''God help him, but mainly, God help his staff.''

HEADLINE: White House Unveils Plan to Double U.S. Exports

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The administration on Thursday unveiled its new strategy to make good on President Obama's promise to double American exports in the next five years. The approach included pledges to pursue more trade agreements, increase pressure on trading partners to open markets and the creation of an export promotion cabinet.
 But in announcing the new strategy, the commerce secretary, Gary Locke, did not say when the administration might send Congress three completed free-trade accords -- with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. Many trade specialists say that is essential to prod other countries to negotiate with the United States. But the move is likely to cause a rift with Mr. Obama's liberal supporters in the Democratic Party, as well as free-trade opponents in the Republican Party. 
 Still, many trade specialists nonetheless welcomed the new strategy, particularly, they said, because it was the first time that the Obama administration had embraced trade liberalization vigorously. 
 ''I'm delighted that after a long period of silence, they seem to have found their voice on the importance of trade liberalization for American prosperity,'' said Daniel M. Price, a former international economics adviser to President George W. Bush. He cautioned that unless the administration moved forward on the existing trade pacts, other countries would not bother to negotiate new agreements. ''Why would future partners think their agreements will get beyond mere language?''
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told a House budget hearing on Wednesday that the administration ''absolutely'' planned to make passage of the three trade pacts part of the new export strategy this year. ''It's not just that,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''We want to be in the game in Asia as they move to negotiate new agreements there.''
 When Mr. Obama announced during his State of the Union speech last week that he wanted to double exports, he praised the idea of forging stronger trade ties with Panama, Colombia and Korea. But pointedly stopped short of urging lawmakers to approve the deals, which had been signed by Mr. Bush. Some Democrats in Congress have linked the Colombia accord to violence against trade unionists, and some lawmakers from the Midwest on both sides of the aisle complain that South Korea has not done enough to open up its markets to American cars.
 In a speech Thursday morning at the National Press Club, Mr. Locke promised that the new export program would ''correct an economic blind spot that has allowed other countries to chip away at America's international competitiveness.''
 Administration officials said the export initiative would provide more financing for export promotion and would identify markets for fast-growing areas like green energy and environmental goods and services, health care and biotechnology.
 Mr. Locke promised that from now on, export promotion would have ''focused attention from the president and his cabinet.''
 The administration will also form an export promotion cabinet -- to be made up of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative; Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Mr. Locke.
 Since taking office a year ago, Mr. Obama had steered clear of any trade moves that could alienate Democrats, but he has also been praised by free-trade proponents who say that he did not provoke any trade wars or adopt any overtly protectionist policies, often the first refuge of leaders in an economic downturn.
 ''The creation of an export promotion cabinet will be helpful if it focuses political attention on supporting U.S. exports and opening markets to U.S. goods and services,'' said Mr. Price, who is now a partner at the law firm Sidley Austin. 
 But, he added, ''rearranging chairs around a table, or changing the name of the table, seldom changes results.''

HEADLINE: House Allows Debt to Rise $1.9 Trillion

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House voted Thursday to allow the government to go $1.9 trillion deeper in debt, an increase of about $6,000 for every United States resident.
 The accumulated debt already amounts to roughly $40,000 per person. 
 The debt increase, approved 217 to 212, is only enough to keep the government afloat for about another year as it borrows more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends. 
 The budget is more than $3.7 trillion this year, and the deficit is approaching $1.6 trillion under the budget submitted by President Obama this week.
 Democratic leaders devised the increase, to $14.3 trillion in the cap on federal borrowing, to ensure that the rank and file will not have to vote on another increase before the November midterm elections, when they will face voters who are angry over government spending and debt.
 Passage of the bill sends it to Mr. Obama, who will sign it to avoid a first-ever default on United States obligations.
 Thirty-seven Democrats, mostly from Republican-leaning districts, voted against the measure. So did all Republicans, even though they routinely supported increases in the borrowing cap when their party controlled Congress or when George W. Bush was president.
 To help win passage of the debt increase, Democratic leaders put forward budget rules intended to curb the increasing deficit. The new rules, approved Thursday on a 233-to-187 vote, would require future spending increases or tax cuts to be paid for with either cuts to other programs or equivalent tax increases.
 If the rules are broken, the White House budget office could force automatic cuts to programs like Medicare, farm subsidies and unemployment insurance. Current rules lack such enforcement provisions and have commonly been waived over the past few years, at a cost of about $1 trillion.
 Most other benefit programs -- including Medicaid, Social Security and food stamps -- would be exempt from such cuts, which has led Republicans to charge that the new rules are just as weak as the old.

HEADLINE: Dodd Denounces Pace of Banking Overhaul

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Executives at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase expressed misgivings on Thursday about the Obama administration's new proposals to restrict the size and risk-taking of the country's largest financial institutions.
 Their comments, before the Senate Banking Committee, appeared to further complicate the challenge facing the panel's chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. For months, Mr. Dodd has been leading closed-door negotiations over a bill to overhaul the nation's financial regulations, and on Thursday he expressed dismay at how long the process was taking. 
 ''The fact is, I am frustrated, and so are the American people,'' Mr. Dodd said at the start of the hearing, adding that few of the rules of Wall Street had changed, nearly two years after the collapse of Bear Stearns at the inception of the financial crisis. 
 Mr. Dodd said the White House was ''on the right track'' with its new ideas but warned of difficulty ahead. 
 ''The refusal of large financial firms to work constructively with Congress on this effort borders on insulting to the American people, who have lost so much in this crisis,'' he said.
 He added that the financial services industry had sent ''an army of lobbyists whose only mission is to kill the common-sense financial reforms the public demands.''
 Only two days earlier, Mr. Dodd had sounded a different note when Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, testified on the two proposals he has championed. One would ban deposit-taking banks from proprietary trading -- making market bets using their own money -- and from owning hedge funds or private equity funds. The other would limit industry consolidation by capping the market share of a wide range of bank liabilities, not just deposits.
 Barry L. Zubrow, chief risk officer and executive vice president of JPMorgan Chase, called the first proposal a ''divergence from the hard work being done'' by lawmakers and regulators to address the causes of the financial crisis. 
 ''The activities the administration proposes to restrict did not cause the financial crisis,'' he said. Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch failed because of ''excessive exposure to real estate risk,'' while companies like Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Countrywide Financial and IndyMac were crippled by defaults on subprime mortgages, he said. 
 He said that regulators already had authority to restrict the use of insured deposits to finance the kind of trading the White House wants to ban. Such a ban, he said, would make borrowing more expensive, ''with no commensurate benefit in reduced systemic risk.'' 
 Mr. Zubrow added that ''artificially capping liabilities'' of banks would hinder their ability to make loans or invest in government bonds. ''Capping the scale and scope of healthy financial firms cedes competitive ground to foreign firms and to less regulated, nonbank financial firms -- which will make it more difficult for regulators to monitor systemic risk,'' he said. ''It would likely come at the expense of economic growth at home.''
 E. Gerald Corrigan, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, was more measured in his criticisms. But he urged the senators to distinguish between proprietary trading and hedging and risk-management activities driven by the interests of clients -- which he called ''natural activities of banks and bank holding companies.''
 He also said the financial risks associated with ownership of hedge funds and private equity funds ''can be effectively managed by means short of outright prohibition,'' including tough oversight. 
 John S. Reed, a former chairman of Citigroup, often mentioned as an example of an institution considered too big to fail, offered a different perspective. Mr. Reed, who has been supportive of Mr. Volcker's ideas, told the senators, ''The industry should be compartmentalized so as to limit the propagation of failures and also to preserve cultural boundaries.'' 
 He also expressed support for a separate consumer financial protection agency that would regulate services like credit cards, mortgages and debt collection -- a proposal that was part of a reform bill that the House passed in December, but has faced strong opposition in the Senate.
 Two scholars who appeared before the committee also clashed in their views. Hal S. Scott, professor of international finance systems at Harvard Law School, said the Volcker proposals were too broad and that the banking reforms required international coordination. 
 But Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund who now teaches at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said ''the Volcker rules do not go far enough,'' urging a cap on bank assets as a percentage of gross domestic product.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senator Is Sworn In, and Democrats Regroup

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and JEFF ZELENY; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama and Congressional Democratic leaders sought to reset their agenda as they lost their 60th vote in the Senate on Thursday, trying to push ahead with measures to spur more job creation even as they grasped for ideas to keep alive their health care legislation.
 On the day Scott Brown of Massachusetts was sworn in as the 41st Republican senator, Democrats offered only the bare outlines of their approach to jobs legislation and met at the White House to hash out a strategy for their agenda. 
 The core of the proposal will probably be a payroll tax break for employers who hire workers who have been without jobs for at least 60 days. Democrats are trying to enlist Republican support for that approach, which was proposed most recently by Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. 
 Democrats were hoping that the support of at least a few Republicans could build momentum behind a bill now that they no longer have the 60 votes that allowed them to break Republican filibusters solely from within the ranks of Democrats or those who caucus with them. 
 Negotiators on the Senate Finance Committee were said to be nearing an agreement on the core components of a jobs package, including the payroll tax relief and an extension of a portfolio of existing tax breaks, including incentives for research and development.
 But a deal remained elusive on Thursday evening as senators tried to work out details including how to pay for the jobs proposal. Democrats were also pushing to include an extension of unemployment benefits and of health care coverage for those out of work. Discussions were also under way about potentially attaching other initiatives, including a provision to prevent a steep cut in Medicare payment rates for doctors and a reauthorization of money for highway repairs. 
 The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said that the Senate would move forward with a jobs package on Monday with or without bipartisan agreement but that he was hoping for cooperation. ''That really would be good for the country and good for us,'' he said. But he warned that he was prepared to push forward with his own proposal if an agreement could not be reached. 
 Showing the difficulty of finding common ground, a senior aide to the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, issued a quick statement questioning the Democrats' lack of job specifics. ''They don't know what's in the bill or how many jobs they expect it to 'save or create' or when anyone beyond the Beltway will see it or how much it will cost,'' the aide, Don Stewart, said. 
 At the White House, Mr. Obama and the four Democratic Congressional leaders met to set priorities for the legislative agenda given the new realities on Capitol Hill. 
 Without a clear path forward on health care, the president was discussing a job-creation bill and other economic measures, along with financial regulatory reform and energy initiatives.
 ''I have no doubt that there will be plenty in any package that can and should garner support, from the Democratic side as well as the Republican side,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary.
 With the new makeup of the Senate in place, Mr. Obama issued a fresh call for Democrats and Republicans to quit questioning one another's motives and to make an effort to move beyond the cynicism and political gamesmanship that has weighed down the politics of Washington. 
 ''Civility is not a sign of weakness,'' Mr. Obama told a bipartisan audience at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday morning. The efforts at trying to smooth relations between the two parties had clear limits, though, which were underscored by the president's appearances on Thursday evening at two Democratic fund-raising events in Washington. 
 And Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said Thursday that Republicans had not decided whether they would participate in a bipartisan commission the president plans to establish to examine ways to lower the deficit.
 ''We've not seen any details of this so-called commission,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''If it's truly going to be a bipartisan effort, then the creation of the commission ought to be done in a bipartisan effort.'' 
 With the exception of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. swearing in Mr. Brown, the White House did not publicly acknowledge the political shift in the Senate. But at a Democratic fund-raising event on Thursday evening, Mr. Obama conceded that the path ahead would be difficult.
 ''I know some of you might be discouraged because changing the ways of Washington is hard -- it's harder than a lot of you thought it might be,'' Mr. Obama told his supporters. ''Sometimes it might make you feel like it's not possible and you want to give up. Don't give up! I don't want you to feel discouraged.''
 After his swearing-in, Mr. Brown, who has become something of a national political celebrity from the attention that focused on the Massachusetts special election, said he was ready to get to work.
 ''I can't promise I will be right in every vote I make,'' he said. ''I am sure I will make mistakes from time to time. However, I have always tried to learn and grow and will do the very best job that I can on an everyday basis.''

HEADLINE: New York State Labor Chief Is Confirmed to Federal Post

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The Senate voted 60 to 37 on Thursday to confirm M. Patricia Smith, the New York State labor commissioner, for the Labor Department's No. 3 post.
 The vote came three days after Democrats mustered 60 votes to overcome Republican opposition to Ms. Smith, whom the Republicans accused of making misleading statements in her Congressional testimony. 
 Ms. Smith will serve as the department's solicitor, its chief law enforcement official, who traditionally plays a crucial role overseeing wage-and-hour and job safety enforcement.
 Ms. Smith is known for vigorous enforcement against minimum-wage and overtime violations in New York, and some Republican senators have voiced concern that she would be hostile to small business.
 ''She clearly has a deep and passionate commitment to helping American workers,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who leads the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. ''Her expertise is needed now more than ever, particularly in this economy when American workers are struggling and deserve a strong advocate.''
 Republicans protested that the Democrats had rushed Monday's cloture vote so it would take place before Scott Brown, the newly elected Republican senator from Massachusetts, was sworn in. Mr. Brown took his oath on Thursday.
 Ms. Smith's confirmation had been held up for three months by Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the labor committee's top Republican. Mr. Enzi accused Ms. Smith of misleading the Senate in testifying about a New York program, Wage Watch, in which labor unions and immigrant groups worked with state officials to uncover wage-and-hour violations.
 During the confirmation fight, Republicans voiced concern that that program was used to help unions organize workers. Republicans also said Ms. Smith had been untruthful when she testified that she had not held discussions about expanding the Wage Watch program.
 Ms. Smith ultimately acknowledged that she had unintentionally misspoken on some matters, saying she had meant to say only that she had not authorized the program's expansion.

HEADLINE: Can Republicans Capitalize on Democrats' Worries?

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
James Warren is a longtime Chicago journalist and the publisher of The Chicago Reader.

 BODY:
James Warren is a columnist for the Chicago News Cooperative.
 Votes in the Illinois primary elections on Tuesday were being counted just as ABC started the final season of ''Lost.'' The state's Republican Party, marooned on an island of ineptitude, could now be liberated partly because of whom Democrats picked as their nominee for the Senate.
The nominee, State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, will be at the top of the November ballot, and he makes Democratic leaders anxious. Even though the general election is politically light-years away, many unrelated factors could have an impact. And the Republicans are, well, the Republicans, bumbling holders of just 7 of 28 federal or statewide offices. 
 Part of the Democrats' worry involves a sense that Mr. Giannoulias, while affable and good looking, will appear to lack heft when compared with the Republican nominee, Representative Mark Steven Kirk. The prospect of Mr. Kirk, arrogant but very smart, prompted the White House to try to persuade the state attorney general, Lisa Madigan, to run for the Senate seat. 
 But while Democrats wonder about Mr. Giannoulias's gravitas, there is also concern about the untidiness of his family's bank -- an issue exploited only somewhat by his opponent in the primary, David Hoffman, a political novice who made the far better-financed, self-styled protege of President Obama squirm. 
 For sure, Mr. Giannoulias was artful in his Pavlovian, post-victory response to questions about his years at Broadway Bank, the source of his wealth and claim of competence. After dodging the issue for weeks, he kept saying, ''A lot of family businesses are struggling.'' 
 The nominee, a Gold Coast bachelor, portrays himself as an ally of the working class, with the hope that voters are more concerned about jobs than a small bank's travails. But consider the possibilities. 
 A just-announced consent decree with state and federal bank regulators requires Broadway to raise more than $50 million by April. In addition, Mr. Giannoulias's brother, Demetri, who runs the bank, must hire government-approved consultants to recommend changes in lending policies and financial reporting. 
 It is unlikely any outside investor would inject new capital. This means the family, which took out $70 million in dividends at the height of the real estate bubble, could be forced to reinvest much of that capital or risk having the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shut the bank down. Alexi Giannoulias's financial assets, and air of competence, could be deflated, with Mr. Kirk sure to be more unsparing than Mr. Hoffman. 
 Now throw in the coming trial of Rod R. Blagojevich and the headaches that might cause Democratic candidates. The trial will be a giant infomercial for Republicans, and some Democratic leaders in the state are worried. 
 Mr. Giannoulias, they fear, will make it harder to motivate the base. Add that to an off-year election, in which the party in power traditionally does weaker, add in a recession, a Blagojevich trial hangover, and it will remind folks what they hate about Democrats. 
 Talking to elected leaders, some of whom nominally supported Mr. Giannoulias, one gets an insider's guide to politics. They detail legislative ''swing'' districts with recently elected Democrats, changing demographics and party erosion downstate, counterbalanced by recent victories in the Chicago suburbs. 
 Potentially vulnerable Democrats include the first-term State Representative Mark Walker of Arlington Heights, the first-term State Senator Michael Bond of Grayslake, the first-term State Senator Michael Noland of Elgin, State Representative Emily McAsey of Crest Hill and Daniel Biss of Evanston, a House candidate for an open seat. 
 And Mr. Giannoulias could be a drag. He is such a heavy lift, he may give some Democrats a hernia just thinking about getting him elected. 
 On Wednesday, a state senator said that some colleagues must stay far away from the races for senator and governor. 
 Does that same reasoning suggest that Mr. Obama won't aggressively campaign in Illinois? 
 ''If you imagine Barack as Superman, Illinois is Krypton,'' said a Democratic legislator and Obama friend.
 From this vantage point, Illinois makes the president look weak. It reminds outsiders he is from Chicago and ramps up the whole G.O.P. attack machinery. 
 But it's hard to imagine that Mr. Obama won't reprise his successful stumping for candidates as a celebrity senator four years ago. 
 Still, throw in Patrick J. Quinn, the accidental governor, stumbling to victory and disclosures that Scott Lee Cohen, the stealth Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, allegedly held a knife to the throat of a former girlfriend who was a prostitute. Republicans may not be so lost.

HEADLINE: The Chicago Way: Aldermen's Furloughs Aren't Quite So Painful

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS

 BODY:
Chicago aldermen often insist that their job is so demanding that they never really get a day's rest. Now, that assertion is being confirmed by an official policy of Mayor Richard M. Daley's administration. 
 The mayor and most members of the City Council -- but far from all -- are doing what the rest of the city's work force was made to do during the current budget crisis, taking off as many as 15 unpaid days in 2009 and bracing for another 24 unpaid days this year.
 But even the elected leaders taking furlough days are not feeling the pain of the recession as deeply as rank-and-file workers. That is because the Daley administration gives aldermen a break by deducting their furlough days from a 365-day schedule. Clout pays off again. 
 Here is how the math works: If, for example, you are a snowplow driver, tree trimmer, secretary or other typical city worker, you have 261 work days a year. So each furlough day translates into a deduction of 1/261st from your yearly wages. Twenty-four unpaid days works out to a 9.2 percent pay cut. 
 The mayor, the clerk, the treasurer and Council members, however, give up 1/365th of their annual salary for each furlough day. So an elected official would be subject to only a 6.6 percent salary cut. 
 While most city workers must take the furlough days, the elected officials are not required to do so. To show solidarity with the workers, 28 of the 50 aldermen took at least 15 furlough days and Mayor Daley took 16 in 2009, city records show. The sacrifices saved the city about $205,000. 
 Richard Mell, the 33rd Ward alderman and father-in-law of former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, led the way with 21 furlough days. 
 ''My goal is not to get a big pat on the back,'' said Mr. Mell, who became wealthy as owner of a spring factory. 
 The days that aldermen most frequently claimed they were on furlough were holidays. 
 Three aldermen -- Frank Olivo (13th), JoAnn Thompson (16th) and Brendan Reilly (42nd) -- took no furlough days last year. Mr. Olivo and Ms. Thompson did not return calls, but Mr. Reilly promised to take 24 furlough days in 2010. He said he was among the few aldermen who declined a raise. 
 Aldermanic salaries are tied to the local Consumer Price Index, so when the index fell 3.5 percent last year, aldermen were in line for a pay cut, to $106,644. 
 But 38 council members averted that fate, said Pete Scales, a city budget office spokesman. They simply submitted an affidavit to the city indicating that they still want to be paid the higher annual wage of more than $110,000.

HEADLINE: Clinic Works to Include Ex-Inmates in Health Care's Embrace

BYLINE: By APRIL DEMBOSKY

 BODY:
The inadequacy of prison health care in California was one reason for the federal court decisions that will reduce the prison population by 40,000 inmates, starting this year. As the former prisoners, and their illnesses, move back into communities, they will struggle to overcome a new set of obstacles and find a way to better care.
 ''What happens in the prison system isn't isolated in the prison system,'' said Dr. John Stobo, senior vice president for health sciences and services for the University of California system. ''It spills over into the free world.''
And it is not clear that the county health systems in places like the Bay Area -- where more than 15,000 parolees already return every year-- are ready. 
 Because of intravenous drug use, unprotected sex and tattooing with unsterile needles, rates of H.I.V. infection are nine times higher in prison populations than in the public, according to a 2009 report from the RAND Corporation. The rates of hepatitis C were found to be at least 10 times higher, and probably much more. 
 Additionally, with the prison population aging, and a large segment lacking consistent care for most of their lives, advanced diabetes, hypertension, asthma and cancer are common. 
 Current public health care systems are not designed to accommodate the varied logistical and cultural needs of men and women who have been incarcerated. As a result, many former inmates simply do not seek care at all, said several doctors who work with former prisoners. 
 ''Incarceration strips you of responsibility for yourself,'' said Clifton Martin, who spent 20 years in and out of prison on drug and theft convictions and now works at a drug counseling center. ''You get three meals a day. Your laundry is done for you. Even your medication is brought to you.''
 The failure of former inmates to connect with medical services also has consequences for public health. Untreated infectious diseases like hepatitis C, latent tuberculosis and H.I.V. infection can be spread to family members or the public. Missing even a few days of H.I.V. medication can lead to drug resistance and increased viral loads, making the virus easier to transmit. 
 Some counties are looking to the Transitions Clinic in San Francisco as a possible model for ensuring that this group gets health care. The clinic is the first in the country specifically for parolees, combining aggressive outreach -- like recruiting prisoners before their release -- with a nonjudgmental approach. 
 ''You get out, and you're angry,'' said Ronald Sanders, a community health worker at Transitions and a former inmate. ''A lot of these other clinics don't know how to deal with ex-cons, how to talk to them, how to approach them.''
 When those who have recently been paroled have no access to primary care, they tend to end up in emergency rooms with advanced illnesses that are complicated and expensive to treat. 
 ''You have uncontrolled hypertension leading to stroke, heart failure; uncontrolled diabetes, leading to leg ulcers, kidney failure, blindness, heart failure; untreated cancers,'' Dr. Stobo said. ''Treatment is not happening early where it's more effective.''
 Mr. Martin said the blame could be placed on patients and the health care staff.
 ''I've seen a lot of conflict in the public heath care system,'' he said. ''We carry a lot of resentment and trauma from the experience in prison, and sometimes that can be acted out. They've not been trained to be sensitive to that population.''
 With an eye toward saving money in the long run by preventing overuse of emergency rooms and providing comprehensive care that may reduce recidivism, several counties are learning from the Transitions Clinic. 
 ''It's good to have a particular clinic that you know is culturally competent to the population,'' said Cynthia Belon, the director of the Contra Costa County homeless program. 
 On Thursday and Friday afternoons, Juanita Alvarado runs through the Transitions Clinic in Bayview, escorting patients to examination rooms, taking case-management calls on her cellphone and handing out candy to co-workers. 
 ''What's up with you?'' she calls to Sherice Scranton, a patient sitting across the waiting room. She hurries over and gives her a huge hug. They chitchat. Then Ms. Alvarado asks how Ms. Scranton is doing. How does she feel about her coming mammogram? 
 Ms. Alvarado and her colleague, Mr. Sanders, are the heart of the clinic. They were both trained as community health workers at City College of San Francisco. Both bring their own prison experiences to bear in anticipating patients' needs and helping them through the system.
 ''They trust me because they know I've been there, done that,'' Ms. Alvarado said. The clinic easily fills up to 144 patient slots a month. They are already at capacity and are trying to figure out a way to fit in another 36 visits. 
 The medical director, Dr. Shira Shavit, manages common post-prison chronic diseases, making referrals to specialists for advanced illnesses. Ms. Alvarado and Mr. Sanders also connect patients to mental health and substance-abuse counseling, housing and employment programs.
 ''In prison I was just a number,'' said Kenneth Mays Jr., who spent 10 years in and out of prison on drug and robbery convictions. ''I was not a person, not a black man with high blood pressure. They have no ears for what's going on with you.''
 Mr. Mays calls the Transitions staff family.
 He comes to the clinic once or twice a month for his hypertension and for support in avoiding cocaine. ''I'm getting health care that's probably as good as President Obama's,'' he said. 
 Contra Costa County is considering opening a clinic similar to Transitions by the end of the year. Alameda County has a similar clinic called Healthy Oakland. Other Bay Area counties, at best, are just beginning to develop re-entry health programs. 
 Under a new state law, California slowly began reducing its prison population in January, with the full reduction plan expected to take effect after resolution of a Supreme Court appeal. 
 The impending increase of parolees -- coupled with the normal parole cycle that releases about 120,000 inmates a year -- only intensifies the problem of creating continuity between the care inmates receive in prison and after their release, Dr. Shavit said. 
 ''It really should be coordinated care,'' she said. ''Those walls make it extremely difficult for prisoners inside to communicate with the providers in the community.''
 For instance, hepatitis C takes 6 to 12 months to treat, and latent tuberculosis takes six to nine. Disrupting H.I.V. treatment carries serious risks. 
 And the frustrations that face all patients -- long waits on hold, phone trees -- are particularly hard for former inmates. Bay Area counties are hiring community health workers like Ms. Alvarado to coach parolees through such moments. 
 They try to identify prisoners with health care needs while they are still incarcerated, then meet them at parole meetings after they are released. They go with them to appointments and constantly check in by phone to make sure they are taking their medication.
 This spring, City College will graduate its first group of community health workers with a special certificate in caring for the post-prison population. 
 ''The concern for us is how they'd add additional burden to our already taxed delivery systems,'' Stephen Kaplan, director of alcohol and drug services for San Mateo County, said, referring to the parolees. ''We don't want this to be a repeat of when psychiatric institutions were deinstitutionalized and the money didn't follow people out. The communities now bear the responsibility of that.''

HEADLINE: Two European Banks Post Strong Profits

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and CHRIS V. NICHOLSON

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank reinforced its position as one of the survivors of the global financial crisis Thursday, posting its fourth consecutive quarterly profit after a record loss a year earlier.
 Banco Santander -- the biggest Spanish bank and one of the largest in Europe -- reported a solid increase in year-end profit on Thursday, helped by growth in Brazil and Britain and a turnaround at its United States unit, Sovereign.
 Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, reported a net profit of 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in the last quarter of 2009, compared with a loss of 4.8 billion euros a year earlier. Net revenue for the quarter was 5.5 billion euros. 
 The profit was posted a year after the low point of the financial crisis for Deutsche Bank. In the fourth quarter of 2008, proprietary trading, in which the bank bet its own money on securities markets, exposed Deutsche Bank to the fury of the crisis and helped lead to the huge loss.
 During 2009, however, Deutsche Bank rebounded strongly. For the full year, it reported a net profit of 5 billion euros, after a loss of 3.8 billion euros in 2008. ''Deutsche Bank achieved a great deal in 2009,'' the chief executive, Josef Ackermann, said in a statement. ''We used these good results to bolster our capital base, and our capital ratios are stronger than ever.''
 For 2010, he said, ''We see a clear trend to recovery, and stabilization of financial markets, although the effects of the recent crisis will take time to work through.''
 Deutsche Bank said pretax profit in the fourth quarter was 756 million euros, in contrast to a pretax loss of 6.2 billion euros a year earlier. Net income was higher than pretax profit because the bank benefited from a tax credit of 790 million euros related to its business in the United States.
 Deutsche Bank shares closed at $59.60 on Thursday, down $4.48, or 7 percent 
 Banco Santander, meanwhile, said that its fourth-quarter profit was 2.2 billion euros ($3.1 billion) up about 13 percent from a year earlier. For the year, it posted a profit of 8.9 billion euros, second only to the results of 2007, before the financial markets crashed.
 The bank said it also had realized 2.6 billion euros from one-time capital gains, which it is adding directly to its capital reserves. Santander's core capital now stands at 8.6 percent, the bank said.
 Alfredo Saenz, chief executive and vice chairman of Santander, cautioned that it expected more write-offs in 2010, but gave no figure.
 ''Nonperforming loans will probably continue to increase in 2010 and reach their peak in the middle of the year,'' Mr. Saenz said at a news conference in Madrid. 
 Santander shares closed at $12.65 on Thursday, down $1.53 or 10.8 percent. 
 Referring to Spain, he added that he expected them to remain below 4 percent of the bank's total loan portfolio. For Latin America, he predicted about 4.25 percent. Spain is suffering from a real-estate slump as profound as that in the United States, but Banco Santander has been aided by its far-flung operations.
 In October 2008, Banco Santander agreed to buy the 75 percent that it did not own of Sovereign Bancorp, based in Philadelphia. The group said that Sovereign broke even in the fourth quarter, for the first time since the takeover, and that its turnaround was on track.
 ''Sovereign brought in no profit in 2009, but will in 2010,'' Mr. Saenz said.
 In Britain, where Santander is renaming its Abbey and Bradford & Bingley units Banco Santander, the bank reported a 55 percent increase in profit for the year. Santander plans to associate all 1,300 Abbey and Bradford & Bingley branches with the group's name by year end. Its other British unit is Alliance & Leicester.
 In Brazil, the group raised $8 billion in October by selling a 16 percent stake in Banco Santander Brasil in an initial public offering. In addition to that one-time gain, its net operating income in the country was up 23 percent for the year, and looks poised to continue.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Scare Tactics

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
These days it's hard to pick up a newspaper or turn on a news program without encountering stern warnings about the federal budget deficit. The deficit threatens economic recovery, we're told; it puts American economic stability at risk; it will undermine our influence in the world. These claims generally aren't stated as opinions, as views held by some analysts but disputed by others. Instead, they're reported as if they were facts, plain and simple.
 Yet they aren't facts. Many economists take a much calmer view of budget deficits than anything you'll see on TV. Nor do investors seem unduly concerned: U.S. government bonds continue to find ready buyers, even at historically low interest rates. The long-run budget outlook is problematic, but short-term deficits aren't -- and even the long-term outlook is much less frightening than the public is being led to believe. 
 So why the sudden ubiquity of deficit scare stories? It isn't being driven by any actual news. It has been obvious for at least a year that the U.S. government would face an extended period of large deficits, and projections of those deficits haven't changed much since last summer. Yet the drumbeat of dire fiscal warnings has grown vastly louder. 
 To me -- and I'm not alone in this -- the sudden outbreak of deficit hysteria brings back memories of the groupthink that took hold during the run-up to the Iraq war. Now, as then, dubious allegations, not backed by hard evidence, are being reported as if they have been established beyond a shadow of a doubt. Now, as then, much of the political and media establishments have bought into the notion that we must take drastic action quickly, even though there hasn't been any new information to justify this sudden urgency. Now, as then, those who challenge the prevailing narrative, no matter how strong their case and no matter how solid their background, are being marginalized.
 And fear-mongering on the deficit may end up doing as much harm as the fear-mongering on weapons of mass destruction.
 Let's talk for a moment about budget reality. Contrary to what you often hear, the large deficit the federal government is running right now isn't the result of runaway spending growth. Instead, well more than half of the deficit was caused by the ongoing economic crisis, which has led to a plunge in tax receipts, required federal bailouts of financial institutions, and been met -- appropriately -- with temporary measures to stimulate growth and support employment. 
 The point is that running big deficits in the face of the worst economic slump since the 1930s is actually the right thing to do. If anything, deficits should be bigger than they are because the government should be doing more than it is to create jobs.
 True, there is a longer-term budget problem. Even a full economic recovery wouldn't balance the budget, and it probably wouldn't even reduce the deficit to a permanently sustainable level. So once the economic crisis is past, the U.S. government will have to increase its revenue and control its costs. And in the long run there's no way to make the budget math work unless something is done about health care costs.
 But there's no reason to panic about budget prospects for the next few years, or even for the next decade. Consider, for example, what the latest budget proposal from the Obama administration says about interest payments on federal debt; according to the projections, a decade from now they'll have risen to 3.5 percent of G.D.P. How scary is that? It's about the same as interest costs under the first President Bush.
 Why, then, all the hysteria? The answer is politics.
 The main difference between last summer, when we were mostly (and appropriately) taking deficits in stride, and the current sense of panic is that deficit fear-mongering has become a key part of Republican political strategy, doing double duty: it damages President Obama's image even as it cripples his policy agenda. And if the hypocrisy is breathtaking -- politicians who voted for budget-busting tax cuts posing as apostles of fiscal rectitude, politicians demonizing attempts to rein in Medicare costs one day (death panels!), then denouncing excessive government spending the next -- well, what else is new?
 The trouble, however, is that it's apparently hard for many people to tell the difference between cynical posturing and serious economic argument. And that is having tragic consequences.
 For the fact is that thanks to deficit hysteria, Washington now has its priorities all wrong: all the talk is about how to shave a few billion dollars off government spending, while there's hardly any willingness to tackle mass unemployment. Policy is headed in the wrong direction -- and millions of Americans will pay the price.

HEADLINE: Fraying at the Edges

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
''We must hang together,'' Benjamin Franklin once said of the colonies that formed the United States. ''Else, we shall most assuredly hang separately.''
 The countries that use the euro should now be wondering if they face a similar decision. The central core of the 16-nation euro bloc -- most notably Germany and France -- looks solid. But some countries on the fringe of the zone are in deep financial trouble, with high unemployment, clearly unsustainable budget deficits and economies that no longer appear competitive with their European counterparts.
 How Europe chooses to deal with the problems of the countries on the edge, among them Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, may determine the future political shape of Europe, and the future of the euro itself.
 World markets shuddered Thursday in the face of signs that skittish investors were growing more fearful of lending to Portugal. That country had to scale back a short-term borrowing plan, something Europe is not used to seeing. 
 If investors were to walk away, or demand truly exorbitant interest rates, that would put pressure on France, Germany and others in the euro zone to decide just what they would do. Would they bail out their troubled neighbors? Or would they simply allow them to default -- an outcome that would have major repercussions for Europe and financial markets worldwide? 
 At the heart of the problem is Europe's unwillingness more than a decade ago to choose either unification or separation. It wanted economic unification and continued political independence of nation states. 
 In short, it wanted the best of both worlds, and for a time it seemed to have succeeded in that goal. The success amazed many economists, most of them from Britain and the United States, who had argued that a single currency would require much more political unification.
 There remains a widespread view that the fringe countries can count on their more prosperous neighbors for a bailout if one is necessary.
 But such a bailout, if it comes, will raise the question of terms. How much political sovereignty will the bailed-out countries be forced to surrender? Will they be forced to cut spending, or raise taxes, more than the local voters are willing to accept? Will the rest of Europe force major changes in government pension plans, or the firing of state workers? How can they do that, even if they wish to do so, if national Parliaments will not concur?
 There would also be political questions within the core. Many West Germans were appalled by the cost of national unification when East Germany merged into the current German state. If they did not like subsidizing people who in some cases were their cousins, how will they like subsidizing Greeks or Portuguese?
 Perhaps of more importance, how can the troubled economies regain competitiveness within Europe? Before the use of the euro, when Europe tried to maintain exchange rate stability but kept separate currencies, there were periodic sharp devaluations of some currencies, most notably the Italian lira. That made those countries competitive again, for a time.
 Europe's Growth and Stability Pact, which sets the rules for euro membership, limits the size of budget deficits. It was supposed to prevent such problems. But it was largely toothless, especially after Germany and France found it convenient to violate its terms when it suited their economic needs.
 Political union would not cure the underlying economic problems, but it would make it easier for a European government to provide assistance to ailing areas through transfers of tax revenue and special spending programs, and for Continentwide laws to be enacted even if they were deeply unpopular in some areas.
 Even then, problems could arise. In the United States now, some states, including California, are in severe financial straits. California represents a larger part of the American economy than Greece does of the European one, but even if it did default it would not create a national debt crisis, and Washington could provide help.
 The world has sought currency stability across national borders many times. The gold system was such an effort, but it retained separate national currencies whose value against gold could be adjusted if need be. Some economists think that maintaining artificially high exchange rates was a cause of the Great Depression.
 More recently, Argentina tried to use a currency board to maintain stability with the United States dollar. That eventually blew up.
 What could be different in the current euro zone is that the legalities provide no possibility of departure. It is supposed to be the ''roach motel'' of currency unions, a name taken from a pest trap that used to advertise that once the roach checks in, he can never check out.
 If a country were to try to leave, there would be huge questions. What would the new exchange rate be? How would existing debts denominated in euros be handled, whether they were national debts or money owned by companies or individuals? 
 If they had to be repaid in euros, that would provide a new shock to any withdrawing economy, much as countries that owed dollar-denominated debt have struggled after they were forced to devalue. If, on the other hand, a country declared that the debt could be repaid based on some other exchange rate, so that a 100-euro debt could be repaid with local currency now worth less than 100 euros, that would seem wildly unfair to creditors.
 To some extent, the United States once faced that same issue. Many bond contracts issued before President Franklin D. Roosevelt devalued the dollar during the Depression specified that repayment would be in ''gold dollars'' at the historic ratio of gold to the dollar.
 The Supreme Court, in an opinion that may have relied more on economic necessity than on the letter of the law, ruled those contracts unenforceable, and said that debt denominated in gold dollars could be repaid in devalued dollars.
 There is no guarantee that such extreme measures will be required, now or ever. Europe could well muddle through, with vague promises of change satisfying lenders and a world economic recovery reducing the need for harsh action.
 But optimistic forecasts that European countries, faced with the unavailability of currency devaluations, would liberalize their economies to make them more competitive, proved to be wrong.
 If anything, the opposite happened. A common currency, with closely linked interest rates, made it possible for countries to postpone changes, or to try to do them so gradually that they made little difference. It is not easy to persuade politicians to take steps that are likely to lead to them being voted out of office.
 If the euro problem does turn into a crisis, however, 2010 could turn out to be the year of the currency fights. The United States and Europe are both showing more irritation at China's refusal to allow the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar, a decision that makes the Chinese export economy more competitive when it is already running large trade surpluses.
 Currency adjustments are no panacea. Competitive devaluations were common during the Depression, and did no good for the world economy. But some flexibility is needed when economic circumstances change. In some critical parts of the world economy, that flexibility is not there now.

HEADLINE: Effort to Settle Sept. 11 Lawsuits

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
With a firm trial date looming for thousands of lawsuits brought by workers at ground zero against the city, lawyers for both sides are engaged in intensive talks aimed at settling some or all the cases.
 The first 12 cases are scheduled for trial on May 16 in Manhattan. But Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, who is overseeing the litigation, said at a recent hearing that a detailed settlement plan about 70 pages long had been drafted.
 ''There have been intensive discussions going on looking to settlements of individual cases and globally of all cases,'' he said.
 Lawyers for the plaintiffs and the city declined to comment on the negotiations. 
 ''The parties have been working very hard,'' said Judge Hellerstein, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. ''The settlement is complicated.''
 The lawsuits against 90 government agencies and private companies were filed beginning in 2004 by more than 9,000 rescue and cleanup workers who sued over illnesses and injuries they say stemmed from working at the World Trade Center site in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.
 Several hundred lawyers are working on the cases, and the court documents run to tens of millions of pages.
 The plaintiffs claim that the city, along with its contractors and other major defendants like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, offered inadequate safety procedures and supervision to shield them from exposure to contaminants while working amid the debris in a 16-acre area at the site. 
 Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory damages for pain and suffering and economic loss, as well as, in certain cases, medical monitoring. They may also seek punitive damages in appropriate cases, said Paul J. Napoli, one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs.
 James E. Tyrrell Jr., the lead lawyer for the defendants, contends that no link can be proven between the illnesses of plaintiffs and exposure at ground zero, and that some are making false claims. If the cases come to trial, juries will have to decide whether the defendants are at fault, whether the plaintiffs are actually sick and whether their conditions were caused by their work at the disaster site, Mr. Tyrrell said.
 The litigation is complex and politically charged. Among those suing are firefighters, police officers, construction workers and other responders who draw public sympathy. Many elected officials and advocacy groups are demanding compensation, long-term medical treatment and monitoring for the workers from the federal government.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg supports a bill pending in Congress that would offer federal relief to people harmed by work at the site. But the city has, at the same time, been fighting the workers in court, arguing, among other things, that it is immune from damages in cases involving a civil defense disaster or a national emergency. At issue is how great the city's liability would be if it lost the cases.
 ''We would rather stand with the responders before Congress than fight them in the courtroom,'' said Jason Post, a spokesman for the mayor. ''Responders and workers should not have to prove that the city or the contractors are somehow responsible for their harms -- which plaintiffs are obligated to prove and which the city thinks is not the case.''
 Still, in 2007, Mr. Bloomberg said the city was willing to explore settling the cases. 
 Although the cases have been consolidated, they are being considered separately and not as a class-action lawsuit. The court, lawyers for the plaintiffs and the city are selecting a small group of sample cases to bring to trial in the hope that the verdicts will guide settlement of the remaining lawsuits. 
 ''No one seriously thinks that all of these cases would ever be tried,'' said Richard A. Nagareda, a law professor who teaches complex civil litigation at Vanderbilt University Law School. ''Ultimately, everybody understands there's going to be some sort of comprehensive settlement. The question is, what is the price?''
 The city is arguing that its liability is capped at $350 million under federal law, but lawyers for the plaintiffs are disputing that figure. If they prevail, the city could face an enormous cost for its share of the compensation. The city and its contractors are covered by an insurance fund of almost $1 billion financed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The private contractors named as defendants have their own insurance, although the coverage available has not been determined.
 ''We believe there's sufficient coverage to pay all claims with money to spare,'' Mr. Napoli said.
 As in other cases involving exposure to environmental hazards, establishing cause and effect is likely to be difficult. The plaintiffs have been asked to fill out lengthy questionnaires that ask about pre-existing diseases, their medical history as far back as 1995 and other exposures that could have caused the illnesses, like the use of tobacco products.
 But what makes the 9/11 cases even more daunting, some legal experts note, is that the collapse and conflagration of the two towers in 2001 created an unfamiliar toxic soup from the dust and fumes. 
 ''There's not a lot of experience with this kind of risk,'' said Anthony J. Sebok, a professor who specializes in mass torts at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. ''It may be very difficult from a technical point of view to get testimony from experts.''
 The cases also involve thousands of people claiming hundreds of different ailments of varying severity. Many of them were subject to different types of exposure over different periods. To make the litigation more manageable, a severity chart has been created to classify injuries in six major disease categories by type and seriousness, a classification scheme that will help the court pick a sample of cases. 
 The trials could still be delayed as lawyers continue to request documents, file motions and work their way through hearings to decide which expert testimony will be allowed. No decision has been made on whether to try the first cases separately or together, but Judge Hellerstein has said that he is not ''enamored of the idea'' of grouping the cases and that he may bring in other judges to conduct simultaneous trials. 
 Some of the plaintiffs said they hoped for a fair resolution. Glen Klein, 51, a former police officer from Centereach on Long Island who blames his respiratory and gastrointestinal problems on the hundreds of hours he spent on recovery work at ground zero, said that any money would go to pay about $30,000 in credit-card debt he had acquired since his ailments forced him to stop working in 2005.
 Anything else he would invest, he said.
 ''If I woke up one day with a rare cancer, I'd like to take care of my family,'' said Mr. Klein, who is married and has three children. ''I feel I'm just waiting for the hammer to drop on me.''

HEADLINE: Fade to White

BYLINE: By ISHMAEL REED. 
Ishmael Reed is the author of the forthcoming ''Barack Obama and the Jim Crow Media.''

DATELINE: Oakland, Calif. 

 BODY:
 JUDGING from the mail I've received, the conversations I've had and all that I've read, the responses to ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire'' fall largely along racial lines. 
 Among black men and women, there is widespread revulsion and anger over the Oscar-nominated film about an illiterate, obese black teenager who has two children by her father. The author Jill Nelson wrote: ''I don't eat at the table of self-hatred, inferiority or victimization. I haven't bought into notions of rampant black pathology or embraced the overwrought, dishonest and black-people-hating pseudo-analysis too often passing as post-racial cold hard truths.'' One black radio broadcaster said that he felt under psychological assault for two hours. So did I. 
 The blacks who are enraged by ''Precious'' have probably figured out that this film wasn't meant for them. It was the enthusiastic response from white audiences and critics that culminated in the film being nominated for six Oscars by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, an outfit whose 43 governors are all white and whose membership in terms of diversity is about 40 years behind Mississippi. In fact, the director, Lee Daniels, said that the honor would bring even more ''middle-class white Americans'' to his film.
 Is the enthusiasm of such white audiences and awards committees based on their being comfortable with the stereotypes shown? Barbara Bush, the former first lady, not only hosted a screening of ''Precious'' but also wrote about it in Newsweek, saying: ''There are kids like Precious everywhere. Each day we walk by them: young boys and girls whose home lives are dark secrets.'' Oprah Winfrey, whose endorsement assisted the movie's distribution and its acceptance among her white fanbase, said, ''None of us who sees the movie can now walk through the world and allow the Preciouses of the world to be invisible.''
 Are Mrs. Bush and Ms. Winfrey suggesting, on the basis of a fictional film, that incest is widespread among black families? Statistics tell us that it's certainly no more prevalent among blacks than whites. The National Center for Victims of Crime notes: ''Incest does not discriminate. It happens in families that are financially privileged, as well as those of low socio-economic status. It happens to those of all racial and ethnic descent, and to those of all religious traditions.'' 
 Given the news media's tendency to use scandals involving black men, both fictional and real, to create ''teaching tools'' about the treatment of women, it was inevitable that a black male character associated with incest would be used to begin some national discussion about the state of black families.
 This use of movies and books to cast collective shame upon an entire community doesn't happen with works about white dysfunctional families. It wasn't done, for instance, with ''Requiem for a Dream,'' starring the great Ellen Burstyn, about a white family dealing with drug addiction, or with ''The Kiss,'' a memoir about incest -- in that case, a relationship between a white father and his adult daughter. 
 Such stereotyping has led to calamities being visited on minority communities. I've suggested that the Newseum in Washington create a Hall of Shame, which would include the front pages of newspapers whose inflammatory coverage led to explosions of racial hatred. I'm thinking, among many others, of 1921's Tulsa riot, which started with a rumor that a black man had assaulted a white woman, and resulted in the murder of 300 blacks.
 Black films looking to attract white audiences flatter them with another kind of stereotype: the merciful slave master. In guilt-free bits of merchandise like ''Precious,'' white characters are always portrayed as caring. There to help. Never shown as contributing to the oppression of African-Americans. Problems that members of the black underclass encounter are a result of their culture, their lack of personal responsibility. 
 It's no surprise either that white critics -- eight out of the nine comments used on the publicity Web site for ''Precious'' were from white men and women -- maintain that the movie is worthwhile because, through the efforts of a teacher, this girl begins her first awkward efforts at writing. 
 Redemption through learning the ways of white culture is an old Hollywood theme. D. W. Griffith produced a series of movies in which Chinese, Indians and blacks were lifted from savagery through assimilation. A more recent example of climbing out of the ghetto through assimilation is ''Dangerous Minds,'' where black and Latino students are rescued by a curriculum that doesn't include a single black or Latino writer. 
 By the movie's end, Precious may be pushing toward literacy. But she is jobless, saddled with two children, one of whom has Down syndrome, and she's learned that she has AIDS. 
 Some redemption.

HEADLINE: In Internet Era, an Unwilling Lord for New Age Followers

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
Raj Patel's desk sits in a dusty, cement-floored nook in his garage, just beyond a parked gray Prius, near the washer and dryer. They are humble surroundings for a god.
 ''It is absurd to be put in this position, when I'm just some bloke,'' Mr. Patel said.
A native of London now living on Potrero Hill in San Francisco, Mr. Patel suddenly finds himself an unlikely object of worship, proclaimed the messiah Maitreya by followers of the New Age religious sect Share International. 
 He was raised as a Hindu and had never heard of the group. He has no desire for deification. But he may not have a choice. 
 Mr. Patel's journey from ordinary person to unwilling lord is a case of having the wrong resume at the wrong moment in history. For this is a time when human yearning to find a magical cure for the world's woes can be harnessed to the digital age's instant access to a vast treasure-trove of personal information.
 I have known Mr. Patel for four years -- he keeps an office down the hall from mine. He is charming, and as a graduate of Oxford, Cornell University and the London School of Economics, he is considered brilliant, although he is self-effacing. He readily admits to being imperfectly human.
 People began to believe otherwise on Jan. 14 in London when Benjamin Creme, the leader of Share International, who is also known as the Master, proclaimed the arrival of Maitreya. The name of the deity has Buddhist roots, but in 1972, Mr. Creme prophesied the coming Maitreya as a messiah for all faiths called the World Teacher. 
 Mr. Creme did not name the messiah, but he revealed clues that led his devotees to fire up their search engines on a digital scavenger hunt that would lead them to The One. 
 About this time Mr. Patel was publicizing his new economics book, ''The Value of Nothing.'' With blogging, biographies and talk show appearances, the details of his life and views permeated the Internet ether. Crowds packed his readings, his book debuted on the New York Times best-seller list, and he appeared on ''The Colbert Report'' on Comedy Central.
 The Maitreya clues -- his age (supposed to be born in 1972; Mr. Patel was), life experiences (supposed to have traveled from India to London in 1977; Mr. Patel was taken on a vacation there with his parents that year) race (supposed to be dark-skinned; Mr. Patel is Indian) and philosophies -- all pointed to him. Some believe Maitreya will have a stutter. When Mr. Patel tripped over a few words when talking with Mr. Colbert, it was the final sign. 
 ''It became a flood,'' said Mr. Patel, referring to a torrent of e-mail messages that asked: ''Are you The One?'' He removed the contact information from his Web site, but dozens of pages, discussion groups and videos have emerged online proclaiming his holiness. 
 Mr. Patel has emphatically and publicly denied being Maitreya. Bad move. According to the predictions, ''Maitreya will neither confirm, or will fail to confirm, he is Maitreya,'' said Cher Gilmore, a spokeswoman for Share International. 
 Ms. Gilmore said Mr. Creme would not say if he believed Mr. Patel was the messiah.
 Ben Shoucair, 24, a college student from Detroit, does not need more convincing. He said he saw Mr. Patel in a dream, and then was stunned to find a YouTube video and discover his vision was real. Last week, Mr. Shoucair and his father spent $990 on last-minute tickets to fly to San Francisco to be in Mr. Patel's presence at a book promotion. 
 Reached by phone this week, Mr. Shoucair said meeting Mr. Patel had made him ''happy.'' He said the Maitreya evidence was irrefutable. ''It puts it all on Raj Patel at this time in history.'' 
 Mr. Shoucair seemed amazed when told that Mr. Patel did not believe he was the messiah and had never heard of Mr. Creme. ''See how deep the spiritual world is,'' Mr. Shoucair said.
 Mr. Patel said of their pilgrimage: ''It broke my heart. They'd flown all the way from Detroit.''
 Share International's beliefs are rooted in the Theosophical movement popular in Britain in the late-19th century; it later evolved into New Age beliefs, said Ted F. Peters of the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley. Messiahs have been declared before, only to disappoint.
 ''It's incredibly flattering, just for an instant,'' Mr. Patel said of his unwanted status. ''And then you realize what it means. People are looking for better times. Almost anything now will qualify as a portent of different times.''

 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. 
 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THOMAS CHAMBERS (1808-1869): AMERICAN MARINE AND LANDSCAPE PAINTER,' through March 7. With this extraordinary show, a star is born, or rediscovered, or at least given a big museum survey for the first time since 1942. Chambers painted typical 19th-century fare -- Hudson River landscapes and marine views of ships, harbors and naval battles -- in an entrancing, slightly demonic style that was neither strictly realist nor naive. His paintings are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out, ever so slightly off key and out of step. They amplify the understanding of the visual appetite by satisfying it so thoroughly. Chambers may have been the first American artist to have grasped -- as Cezanne and Seurat would -- the implicitly geometric nature of reality. It makes sense that even in 1942 he was called ''America's first modern.'' 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20100204 
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100204
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN USA: CONTEMPORARY INNOVATION,' through April 4. Less an exhibition than an extra-large design seminar in your head, this dense display presents work by all 78 recipients of the annual National Design Awards, which were established in 2000. Encompassing several generations, it honors individuals and corporations and recognizes historic achievements and some of the latest things. One of these is a specially programmed iPod Touch that serves as an exhibition guide; it puts the show in the palm of your hand and is free. Don't even think about not using it. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Smith)20100204
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'TINO SEHGAL,' through March 10. If you've ever wanted to see the interior of the Guggenheim in its pristine state, now's the time. For the solo exhibition of the young European artist Tino Sehgal, the great spiraling rotunda, recently ablaze with Kandinskys, has been cleared out. Yet the space isn't empty. On the rotunda's ground floor, a man and a woman perform an ever-changing, slow-motion amorous embrace. On the ramps above, people walk and talk in pairs or clusters at a leisurely pace, with new participants periodically joining conversations as others drop away. You're invited to join the conversation, be part of the art, in this deeply refreshing, there-but-not-there show. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Holland Cotter)20100204
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR,' through March 28. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)20100204
 JEWISH MUSEUM: 'ALIAS MAN RAY: THE ART OF REINVENTION,' through March 14. This show, a traditional retrospective with an irresistible biographical hook, gives roots to an artist who preferred to be seen as rootless. Born Emmanuel Radnitzky to Jewish emigres from Russia, Man Ray reinvented himself as one of the luminaries of the interwar avant-garde. Yet his garment industry background had a material hold on him, visible in references to mannequins, coat hangers and patterns. More than 200 works, including paintings, photographs, films, assemblages and his signature rayographs, link Man Ray's frequent shifts between mediums to a more profound condition of restlessness. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100204
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' ongoing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100204
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE DRAWINGS OF BRONZINO,' through April 18. Agnolo Bronzino was the hand to hire for a power portrait in mid-16th-century Florence. He could turn toddlers into potentates and make money-mad Medicis look like decent people. At his peak, in the 1550s, he was the most influential artist in Florence. So why, given his fame, he has had to wait some 500 years for a museum solo is a puzzle. But that solo has now arrived at the Met. Encompassing all but 2 of the 61 works on paper currently attributed to the artist, and justifying each attribution in its gorgeous catalog, the show is scholarly tour de force and a breathtaking demonstration of a sovereign hand at work and at play. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20100204
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' ongoing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100204
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100204
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DEMONS AND DEVOTION: THE HOURS OF CATHERINE OF CLEVES,' through May 2. The need for new bindings creates the rare, maybe one-time chance to see 93 of the 157 surviving miniatures from the extraordinary illuminated book of hours commissioned around 1440 by Catherine of Cleves (1417-1479) in the southern Netherlands. Among the masterpieces of a golden age by an anonymous artist known only as the Master of Catherine of Cleves, it features exquisite, jewel-like miniatures that locate the Holy Family, apostles, and saints in the here and now, among detailed interiors and landscapes and trompe l'oeil borders. The kingdom of God gives way to that of the real. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)20100204
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'NEXUS NEW YORK: LATIN/AMERICAN ARTISTS IN THE MODERN METROPOLIS,' through Feb. 28. A bright light at the top of Museum Mile, the city's premier Latino art center has reopened after a makeover with a dense, episodic and absorbing visual history of the Latino art presence in New York in the first half of the 20th century. As much an archival display as a standard art show, it focuses on luminous, culture-changing personalities, from the Mexican-born art impresario Marius de Zayas, who teamed up with Alfred Stieglitz to bring the first Picasso show to New York; to Joaquin Torres-Garcia, a Uruguayan who arrived in New York in 1920 and saw proto-Pop Art everywhere; to the Chilean Roberto Matta, a dynamic agent for Old World Surrealism in the New World. In addition, El Museo now has its first permanent-collection gallery, with an installation, ''Voces y Visiones,'' that reaffirms historical connections to the nearby East Harlem neighborhood. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20100204
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PAUL SIETSEMA,' through Feb. 15. Acute self-consciousness is a salient feature of contemporary art, and few artists are more ingeniously self-reflective than this Los Angelino. Made with much technical finesse, his large drawings reproduce old photographs, newspapers and studio detritus. The grainy black-and-white film meditates on apparently ancient artifacts that Mr. Sietsema actually made by hand. What is real, we are invited to wonder, what can we count on in these epistemologically slippery, hyper-mediated times? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20100204
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at the Museum of Modern Art. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it's constantly being reborn. In its current form at MoMA, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20100204
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TIM BURTON,' through April 26. Given the tremendous visual appeal of Mr. Burton's movies, you would expect that this expansive retrospective of his nonmoving art would be equally exciting. Alas, it is a let-down. Focused mainly on hundreds of Victorian-Gothic-Expressionist cartoons dating from his teenage years to the present and including paintings, sculptures, photographs and a smattering of short films on flat screens, it is an entertaining show, but there is a sameness to all Mr. Burton's two- and three-dimensional output that makes for a monotonous viewing experience. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20100204
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'GABRIEL OROZCO,' through March 1. Gabriel Orozco's delightful 1993 solo debut at the Museum of Modern Art was a barely-there affair of a few photographs, a ball of clay, a hammock and some fresh fruit. His one-man gallery show the next year was sparser still, with four plastic Dannon yogurt cups nailed to the walls of the gallery's otherwise empty space. Mr. Orozco has since gotten considerable mileage out of this early thinking-light phase. Tapped by museums in Chicago, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Mexico City, where he was raised, he has become an object of admiring critical scrutiny, and a hero to many young artists. Why? The question lingers, only half-answered, after seeing this retrospective, a taut, attractive but oddly conventional-looking survey, heavy on painting and sculpture. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20100204
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20100204
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FROM KLIMT TO KLEE: MASTERWORKS FROM THE SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTION,' through Feb. 15. Serge Sabarsky, the art dealer and collector who founded the Neue Galerie with Ronald S. Lauder, never lived to see its 2001 opening. Most visitors to the museum know Mr. Sabarsky (1912-96) primarily through some of the Klimts and Schieles that rotate through the galleries and from the popular first-floor cafe that bears his name. They'll be better acquainted with him after a visit to this exhibition, the first at the Neue Galerie to focus exclusively on Mr. Sabarsky's acquisitions. The high point for many viewers will be the small second-floor room of drawings by Klimt, Schiele, Alfred Kubin and Oskar Kokoschka. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)20100204
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20100204
 THE ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'THE ORIGINS OF EL GRECO: ICON PAINTING IN VENETIAN CRETE,' through Feb. 27. With its ensemble of some 40 religious images, including 6 by Domenikos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, this glowing show is essentially a triple-layered visual essay. It roughs out the complex texture of a specific, cosmopolitan, East-meets-West island culture. It tells the story of a great artist who emerged from that culture, lived outside it and lastingly belonged to it. And it begins to suggest the variety and charisma of icons as a genre: spiritually instrumental objects that lie outside and beyond ordinary definitions of art. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street , (212) 486-4448, onassisusa.org. (Cotter)20100204
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through March 1. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20100204
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: DANIEL BOZHKOV AND DUKE RILEY, through March 13. Two young and opportunistic artists -- Daniel Bozhkov and Duke Riley -- have found a way to make the most of the Queens Museum's transitional state. (The museum is in the process of expanding.) Egged on by trusting curators and a residency program, Launch Pad, that encourages exploration of the site and the Queens community, they have turned to the surrounding park and its former ice rink for materials and inspiration. Their adjacent solo installations are well worth seeing, if only because they are profoundly at odds with each other: Mr. Bozhkov salvages, while Mr. Riley torches the place in a ''naumachia'' (Roman naval battle). Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100204
 RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VICTORIOUS ONES: JAIN IMAGES OF PERFECTION,' through Feb. 15. Although Mohandas Gandhi learned from Jainism, an Indian religion that takes nonviolence as its first principle, in the West we still know little about it or its art. But now there are two exquisite shows of Jain art in New York. The smaller, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through March 28, is made up mostly of tiny, jewel-like manuscript paintings depicting the lives of savior-heroes called jinas. The Rubin Museum has, in addition to large-scale paintings, three dozen splendid sculptures of the same figures. Together the exhibitions give an in-depth view of a great art tradition and a complex faith. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea , (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)20100204
 RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VISIONS OF THE COSMOS: FROM THE MILKY OCEAN TO AN EVOLVING UNIVERSE,' through May 10. This exhibition sets up a thought-provoking compare-contrast exercise between Western and Eastern ways of picturing the universe. On one side, myths about the cosmos are vividly imagined in Hindu, Buddhist and Jainist paintings and sculptures. On the other side, the West's progressively more empirically based beliefs are represented mainly by illustrations in antique books, with astronomical photographs made by high-tech machines like the Hubble Space Telescope representing current scientific knowledge. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea , (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Johnson)20100204
 SCULPTURE CENTER : 'LEOPARDS IN THE TEMPLE,' through March 30. Inspired by a Kafka short story, this exhibition says a lot about the state of contemporary art. It presents an international array of artists who riff on familiar conventions of modern art. Kitty Kraus's squared-off lengths of men's suit fabric lying flat on the floor evoke Carl Andre but with a feminist twist. Don't miss the funny, magical films by the team of Joao Maria Gusmao and Pedro Paiva in the basement. 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)20100204
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20100204
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: '30 SECONDS OFF AN INCH,' through March 14. This exhibition of 60 disparate artworks by 42 contemporary artists from several generations might be called revisionist. It takes a refreshingly visual, even formal, approach to art that is usually plumbed for political and social meanings based largely on the artist's identity. Its curator, Naomi Beckwith, wants to emphasize the meanings -- social and otherwise -- embedded in the actual objects on view. Her success is mixed, partly because she doesn't spend much time explaining the experiential nature of her selections in the catalog, and also because she includes too many familiar, established artists. But she makes many excellent choices, introduces some promising young talent and displays a visual intelligence that is often rare in her chosen profession. 144 West 125th Street , (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)20100204
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OMER FAST: NOSTALGIA,' through Feb. 14. Omer Fast -- who has a powerful, discomforting solo show at the Whitney Museum and another at Postmasters gallery in Chelsea (through Feb. 13) -- was born in Jerusalem in 1972, lives in Berlin and studied art in New York City. In past videos and films he has tackled subjects like the Holocaust, interracial machismo and the war in Iraq. In his new work he adds immigration and terrorism to the list, working a tense terrain that encompasses references to documentary, comedy and action films, and that leaves his own moral position ambiguous. He's really good, and getting better. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20100204
 Galleries: 57th Street
 JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: 'HARD EDGE CLASSICIST PAINTINGS FROM THE 1950'S TO THE 1970'S,' through Feb. 13. With abstract painting again in the art world's eye, the time is right to renew an acquaintance with the American artist John McLaughlin, and this survey of 14 pristine geometric paintings is the first New York survey in some time. Self-taught in the sense that he had no formal training, McLaughlin didn't begin painting until he was in his 40s, by which time he had been a dealer of Japanese art for years and an avid admirer of European abstract artists, particularly Malevich and Mondrian. All of these East/West sources figure into his quirky, spare, unmystical pictures, each seemingly intent on being as concrete and as unlimited as possible. Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, 730 Fifth Avenue , (212) 445-0444, agvdgallery.com. (Cotter)20100204
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'DEMONS, YARNS & TALES: TAPESTRIES BY CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS,' through Feb. 13. All bets are off when artists translate their work from one form into another, especially if the end result is the mad, magical, labor-intensive domain of tapestry. The 13 tapestries here -- commissioned by Banners of Persuasion, an offshoot of the Rug Company of London -- are from Paul Noble, Grayson Perry, Fred Tomaselli, Kara Walker and others. Some artists' ideas are deadened; others are enhanced. The display is wildly uneven but always illuminating, and several efforts are certifiable showstoppers. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street , (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com. (Roberta Smith)20100204
 CHRISTIAN HOLSTAD: 'THE WORLD'S GONE BEAUTIFUL,' through March 6. Christian Holstad was part of a wave of young, busy-handed, crafts-oriented artists who gained attention in the mid-2000s, when the art market was trying to leave identity politics and consumerist critique behind. As it turned out, his work was about both, but he was talking about them in a new way, from the vantage point of a child antsy with adult appetites; many of them are evident in this recession-conscious show of soft-sculpture shopping carts and sex-food-and-religion collages. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street , (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com. (Cotter)20100204
 MARKUS SCHINWALD, through Feb. 20. If you want to feel the wind on your eyeballs, drop by the New York debut of this young Austrian who divides his time between Vienna and Los Angeles, and fittingly pits the Victorian against the modern in his work. Dark, generic, suggestively altered 19th-century portraits and figure paintings dot the walls, while white-on-white beams traverse the space like the real-life, enlarged scaffolding of a Mondrian painting. Other works bring to mind Martin Kippenberger and Sarah Lucas. The initial effect is dazzling, verging on cynical, an ambitious machine too full of other artists' ghosts. Yvon Lambert, 550 West 21st Street , (212) 242-3611, yvon-lambert.com. (Smith)20100204
 JOEL SHAPIRO: 'WORKS: 1969-1979,' through Feb. 13. This show reintroduces the early work of a Post-Minimalist sculptor who swam against the mainstream of macho scale, abstract form, ''real space'' (as the Minimalists admiringly put it) or hermetic meaning. Mr. Shapiro's 1970s works are small without being miniature, representational -- and even symbolic -- yet bluntly involved with sculpture's materials, methods and traditions. Their plain cast-iron or balsa-wood forms announce chairs, factories, bridges, boats, houses and a fallen, somewhat figurative tree in ways that distort space but also tug at the emotions, signaling distance and loss, fragility and finality. Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st Street , (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)20100204
 CHARLES STEFFEN: 'DRAWING NUDES IS LIKE SAYING A PRAYER, AMEN,' through Feb. 27. Rendered in serpentine lines, the naked women drawn late in life by this Chicago outsider artist have bug eyes and a stocky corpulence, like sexed-up troll dolls. Grotesque and cute, they call to mind the cartoons of Gahan Wilson and Basil Wolverton. Steffen (1927-1995) drew his other favorite subject, sunflowers, with a lovely, naturalistic touch. His women with sunflower heads are like deities for a nature religion. Edlin Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street , (212) 206-9723, edlingallery.com. (Johnson)20100204
 Last Chance
 MASTER DRAWINGS NEW YORK Several of the generally outstanding exhibitions that remain open after last week's confluence of drawings dealers are closing on Friday, including exhibitions mounted by Addison Fine Arts at Didier Aaron, 37 East 67th Street; Monroe Warshaw at Alexander Gallery, 942 Madison Avenue, at 74th Street; Mia N. Wiener at L'Antiquiare & the Connoisseur, 36 East 73rd Street; Stiebel Ltd. at 252 East 68th Street; and Thomas Williams and Andrew Wyld at Dickinson, 19 East 66th Street (closing on Monday). masterdrawingsinnewyork.com. (Smith)20100204
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VELAZQUEZ REDISCOVERED'; closes on Sunday. A Velazquez has been caught hiding in plain sight at the Met. The discovery, confirmed after a thorough scrubbing in the conservation lab and detailed in a small exhibition, raises as many questions as it answers. We now know that Velazquez painted the Met's arresting ''Portrait of a Man,'' but the identity of the subject is up for debate. (Is he or isn't he the artist?) You don't need to be an expert witness, though, to appreciate that the Met's cleaning and restoration have been transformative. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100204
 NEW MUSEUM: 'URS FISCHER: MARGUERITE DE PONTY'; closes on Sunday. Naming his first American museum show after a fictional character from Mallarme, the young Swiss sculptor Urs Fischer spreads himself thin, but brilliantly. Admirers of his gaping holes in walls may be disappointed by the sparseness, quiet and subtlety, but for the most part -- despite too much Surrealism 101 -- Mr. Fischer's neo-Dada formalism wins out. Nose-thumbing irreverence colludes with Minimalist space, scale and perception. Take this three-floor show from the top and watch worlds collide: abstraction, found objects and trompe l'oeil; the actual-size, the large and the enlarged; images, reflections and volumes. Each floor is a kind of implosion, although it only becomes obvious on the lowest one. The perpetual twilight in the middle may be the most memorable moment. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20100204
 'PRIMARY ATMOSPHERES: WORKS FROM CALIFORNIA 1960-1970'; closes on Saturday. Perceptual experience is the unifying factor in this ravishing show of Minimalistic works from the 1960s by 11 California artists. James Turrell's wedges of intensely colored light are like sections of a virtual reality. John McCracken's thick planks leaning against the wall -- one bubble gum pink, and the other fire engine red -- have the sheen of surfboards; if you squint, you might see them as extrusions of pure color. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea , (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)20100204

HEADLINE: Hyde Park-Style Politics Are Evident In Preckwinkle Victory

BYLINE: By DON TERRY and DAN MIHALOPOULOS

 BODY:
As chants of ''Toni, Toni, Toni'' washed over her on Tuesday night, Alderman Toni Preckwinkle's pearl necklace glistened in the bright glare of televised victory. She had just become the Democratic nominee for Cook County Board president. 
 Ms. Preckwinkle's success is the latest example of Hyde Park's serving as a launching pad for black politicians putting together multiracial coalitions to win higher office.
 Long known as a liberal bastion of independence from City Hall and the city's Democratic political establishment, Hyde Park has bred political figures who use the skills developed in that diverse South Side enclave to establish careers that take them far beyond Hyde Park. 
 But Ms. Preckwinkle's likely ascension in November's general election to the board presidency, long known as a patronage plum, exposes a less-ballyhooed fact of life in Hyde Park: The neighborhood's political mavericks may brandish strong liberal credentials, but they gain power by entering into a marriage of convenience with the Democratic establishment that remains at the center of Chicago's political universe, the office of Mayor Richard M. Daley. 
 Barack Obama went from community organizing to become a United States senator and president of the United States; Harold Washington, a trailblazing Democrat who made his reputation as a liberal political maverick, rose from Hyde Park to become Chicago's first black mayor; and Carol Moseley Braun, the first black woman elected to the United States Senate, based her political career in Hyde Park. 
 Now Ms. Preckwinkle has become the latest black politician from Hyde Park and neighboring Kenwood to rise by crafting a campaign that appealed to Cook County voters' intermittent willingness to cross racial lines in electing leaders. 
 Indeed, behind-the-scenes financial and political support from allies and relatives of the mayor were crucial to Ms. Preckwinkle's victory in a four-way race in which she defeated Terrence O'Brien, president of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District; Dorothy Brown, the Cook County clerk; and Todd Stroger, the incumbent president who was heir to his father's black political empire and a former ally of Mr. Daley.
 Aides and allies of the mayor attended Ms Preckwinkle's victory party, and the comments of those she defeated mixed regret with a dollop of political reality. 
 ''Nobody does anything unless the mayor says it's O.K.,'' Mr. Stroger said Tuesday night in an interview in his hotel room after his fourth-place finish, a loss he attributed partly to the cold shoulder he got from the mayor. 
 In the salons or University of Chicago classrooms, few of the elite who give Hyde Park its unique political heft like to think of their neighborhood as a an appendage of City Hall. Instead, they focus on how they have begun carving out a reputation as a launching pad to national prominence. 
 The neighborhood's racial and economic diversity, intellectual resources and political traditions have pushed Hyde Park forward. The tensions and challenges that accompany diversity prepare the neighborhood's politicians to deal with those issues on larger stages. That accounts for the success of Hyde Park's black politicians, said Jamie Kalven, an author, public housing advocate and lifelong resident of the Hyde Park area. 
 ''Hyde Park-Kenwood is not just an integrated neighborhood,'' Mr. Kalven said. ''It's an integrated neighborhood that is politically caffeinated and has deep, chronic, underlying tensions, both cultural and historical.'' 
 Today, the same neighborhood contains University of Chicago economists who have had great influence on national and international policies, leading jurists like the conservative Richard Posner, as well as, not far away, the headquarters for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. Of almost 30,000 people who live there, 43.5 percent are white, 37.7 percent are black, 11.3 percent are Asian and 4.1 percent are Latino, according to 2000 census figures.
 State Senator Kwame Raoul, whose 13th Legislative District includes Hyde Park, where he grew up, said the neighborhood tested the mettle of young politicians. 
 ''There's greater accountability,'' Mr. Raoul said. ''People are paying attention. You have to explain yourself. That's a good training ground to sell yourself across the city and the state.'' 
 Paul Fischer, who taught political science at Lake Forest College for 36 years before retiring two years ago, has held fund-raisers in his Evanston home for three of Hyde Park's best-known prodigies: Ms. Preckwinkle, Ms. Braun and Mr. Obama. 
 ''I think African-American politicians living in Hyde Park and running in Hyde Park have a lot of experience attracting white supporters and voters,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''It's partly about communication. It's partly about issues. Living there, you develop a comfort level across racial lines.'' 
 Still, there are limits to the Hyde Park aura. It sometimes plays better in liberal, mostly white lakefront wards than in the city's other bases of black political power. And when it comes time for Hyde Park to deal with City Hall, power always seems to flow only in one direction: toward the mayor's office. 
 When Mr. Obama, as a state senator, first took his message beyond the friendly confines of Hyde Park in 2000 to run for Congress against Representative Bobby L. Rush, he was crushed. 
 ''Outside of Hyde Park, in a blacker community, a lot more working-class and poor community, he had a more difficult time articulating his message,'' Mr. Fischer said of Mr. Obama. ''But when he really branched out, his Hyde Park experience and his manner resonated with voters.'' 
 During the county board primary campaign, Ms. Preckwinkle sought to build a message with broad appeal, regardless of race. Even among her supporters, though, questions remain about her ties to Mayor Daley. 
 State records show the Preckwinkle campaign received financial support last month from the law firm of the mayor's brother Michael and from Terry Newman, Mayor Daley's close friend. On election night, several of Mr. Daley's allies, including the Rev. Leon Finney, one of the mayor's biggest South Side supporters, attended Ms. Preckwinkle's downtown victory celebration. Mr. Daley's former chief of staff, Lori Healey, was also there.
 Dr. Finney said Hyde Parkers were not averse to making deals with the Democratic establishment. ''You have to be independent but realistic,'' he said. 
 Mr. Fischer, the retired college professor, was blunter. ''You don't get very far without kissing the ring,'' he said. 
 Even before she joined the county board race, Ms. Preckwinkle switched from skepticism to full-fledged support of Mayor Daley's bid for the 2016 Olympics, which would have been staged largely in her ward. 
 Alan Dobry, a former Democratic committeeman from Hyde Park and a supporter of Ms. Preckwinkle, said he expected her to remain independent. ''She won't look for any fights with Daley,'' Mr. Dobry said, ''but she will be her own person.'' 
 In a rubber-stamp City Council, Ms. Preckwinkle distinguished herself as one of the more independent aldermen. She once cast the lone vote against the mayor's budget and was one of only five to vote against privatization of city parking. She briefly sought to form a ''progressive caucus'' of aldermen as a counterweight to the mayor's power.
 Alderman Joe Moore, whose 49th Ward in Rogers Park is even more diverse than Hyde Park, said that playing to a diverse political base ''helps you better relate to thebroader coalition you need when you move from local politics to a larger stage.'' 
 Mr. Jackson, closely connected to Hyde Park since he moved there from the South in 1964, said Hyde Parkers focus on what they can accomplish by working across racial and even political barriers. 
 ''Out of that comes relationships that tend to say what's possible,'' he said. ''You develop a comfort level going beyond.'' 
 In her victory speech Tuesday night, Ms. Preckwinkle paid tribute to the Hyde Park-style multiracial coalition that captured the nomination for her. 
 ''Today, the people of Cook County have all spoken in one voice,'' she said. ''Black and white and Latino and Asian. Gay and straight. North Side. West Side. South Side.'' 
 That's the dream coalition of a politician from Hyde Park.

HEADLINE: For Hollywood, Stand-Ins Play California's Part

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Shooting day for night is one thing. Shreveport for Santa Monica is quite another.
 In a new indignity for Hollywood's struggling film production business, Los Angeles and its environs are about to be ravaged by aliens in ''Battle: Los Angeles.'' It stars Aaron Eckhart, is set for release by Sony Pictures in 2011 -- and was shot in Louisiana.
 The cause is no secret: Taxpayer-supported subsidies have steadily drawn film work from Los Angeles to states like Louisiana, Michigan and New Mexico. Those three give filmmakers public support more generous than a complicated tax break California offered to producers last year, in a belated attempt to fight back. 
 New York City, of course, has had to get used to seeing itself depicted on screen in scenes shot in a dozen cities, like Toronto and Vancouver and, yes, Los Angeles. 
 But until now, one thing moviegoers could almost always count on was that if Los Angeles appeared on screen, whether shattered by earthquakes (''Earthquake''), buried under lava (''Volcano'') or turned into a giant penal colony (''Escape from L.A.''), they were seeing the real thing. 
 So it's a harder pill for Los Angeles, the home of American filmmaking, to swallow -- threatening to put it in a class with other cities whose identities were deeply associated with a single industry. These days more cars are made outside Detroit, for instance, and it's been a long time since Pittsburgh depended on its open hearths belching molten steel. 
 ''We've done great, given what we have to work with,'' said Amy Lemisch, the director of the California Film Commission. Ms. Lemisch referred to tax incentives that, by California's count, helped keep 60 film and television projects in the state, where they are expected to generate $710 million in spending during the current fiscal year.
 The bad news: movie location shoots around Los Angeles fell to 4,976 days last year, down 29.9 percent from 2008 and off 64.4 percent from a peak of 13,980 days in 1996, according to FilmL.A., which monitors film permits in the area.
 Producers have routinely had stories based in California rewritten to occur in states with high subsidies, Ms. Lemisch said.
 In a bolder step, some subsidy states are now making movies and television shows that purport to take place in California. The Starz television series ''Crash,'' shot in New Mexico, is one. Another is the feature film ''High School,'' which just screened at the Sundance Film Festival and was shot in Michigan, according to that state's film office.
 And then there is ''Battle: Los Angeles.''
 ''You're never going to know we didn't shoot the movie in Los Angeles,'' said Neal Moritz, a producer of ''Battle: Los Angeles,'' which filmed late last year in Baton Rouge and Shreveport.
 The movie tells the story of a Marine battalion that fights aliens who have invaded Los Angeles. ''It's 'Black Hawk Down' meets 'Independence Day,' '' Mr. Moritz said.
 Some of it is set in Santa Monica, Calif., a beachfront city that Shreveport stood in for, with the help of imported palm trees that were spray-painted bright green, according to a report last fall in The Shreveport Times.
 About 3,000 extras came from as far afield as Texas and Georgia to work on ''Battle: Los Angeles.'' Santa Monica, meanwhile, got a buzzing by three big Marine Corps helicopters that showed up to help film some local color in mid-December.
 ''Battle: Los Angeles'' has been reported to cost about $70 million, making it one of the bigger productions to shoot in Louisiana. Taxpayers expected to reimburse 30 percent of the production's spending in the state -- enough to help dissuade the producers from shooting in Georgia or other subsidy states that had been under consideration.
 But finances were not the only factor that sent ''Battle: Los Angeles'' to Louisiana, said Mr. Moritz, who has shot many movies in Los Angeles, including ''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,'' in which California doubled for Japan. This time, he said, Louisiana shut down a major freeway interchange for three weeks to allow cast and crew to shoot battle scenes that were set on Interstate 405 in Southern California, which closes only for the occasional collision. 
 By and large, Sony Pictures, based in Culver City, Calif., has tried to keep its productions in California. In October Glenn Gainor, the head of physical production for its Screen Gems unit, was even honored at an awards banquet for having kept a string of productions, including pictures like ''Takers'' and ''Burlesque,'' both set for release this year, at home.
 But economic incentives elsewhere have taken their toll, reversing a dynamic under which Hollywood once used Southern California locations for stories set everywhere else. Even ''New York, New York'' -- the director Martin Scorsese's musical tribute to his hometown -- was shot largely in downtown Los Angeles and Culver City.
 Now, said John A. Johnston, a veteran location manager who worked on the film ''Volcano,'' which was set in and around this city's La Brea tar pits, filmmakers have to step carefully when substituting remote locations for places as familiar to viewers as the Golden State.
 ''It takes a bit more footwork and a little bit more thought,'' said Mr. Johnston, who spoke from Louisiana. He has been scouting locations there for ''Green Lantern,'' a Warner Brothers film that takes place in California.
 ''You don't want flora and fauna to be intruding that obviously don't belong,'' Mr. Johnston advised.
 Clumps of Midwestern flora and red-brick suburban homes were not the only heartland intruders when the director Miguel Arteta shot ''Youth in Revolt,'' supposedly taking place in Northern California -- and released by the Weinstein Company last month -- in Ann Arbor and other locations in Michigan.
 In one scene, set in Berkeley, Calif., the distinctive Burton Memorial Carillon Tower of the University of Michigan peeked over the horizon.
 As for the golden hills and redwood forests of California, they were to be seen only when the film's hero, Nick Twisp (Michael Cera), drove a winding road from Ukiah to Santa Cruz. 
 And those sequences were animated.

HEADLINE: Markets Routed As Worry Grows On Europe Debt

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ and JACK EWING

 BODY:
Just as America's recession begins to ebb, trouble is brewing in Europe that may prolong a downturn on the Continent and ricochet through the global economy as it struggles toward a recovery. 
 A rout in stock markets that began in Europe spread to Wall Street on Thursday and around the globe to Asia on Friday, amid fears that Europe may be the world's next financial flashpoint. Pressure has been mounting across the Atlantic as Greece, Portugal and a handful of struggling countries that use the euro scramble to pay off mountains of debt accumulated from years of profligate spending. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average slid 2.61 percent, or 268.37 points, to 10,002.18 Thursday, after briefly falling below 10,000 for the first time since November, as American investors grew more uncertain about Europe's economy. 
 Stock markets across Europe slumped as much as 6 percent, and worries that the troubles might push even big European nations like Spain into a financial crisis drove the euro to $1.37, a seven-month low against the dollar. 
 Asian markets echoed the losses on Friday. The Nikkei in Japan shed 2.9 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was also down 2.9 percent in afternoon trading.
 ''The question now is, how big is this fire going to be?'' said Uri D. Landesman, head of global growth at ING. ''What is panic, and what is legitimate? We don't know at this point.''
 Like the United States, Europe has been slow to exit recession. France and Germany -- the biggest of the 16 countries that use the euro as their currency -- have tried to put their financial houses back in order quickly. But countries on the fringe, including Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, are having trouble paying for years of debt-driven expansion. 
 Now the bill is coming due. In the worst case, they could default on their debts, prolonging the economic downturn. 
 While the tension simmering in Europe has gone largely unnoticed by most Americans, the mounting pressure on these countries to discipline their finances has raised questions about whether the currency union that has peacefully bound Europe's economies for more than a decade risks unwinding.
 Adding to the anxiety among investors Thursday was a bleaker-than-expected report on the United States labor market. Investors are watching unemployment closely as they try to gauge the strength of the recovery and determine whether it will be severely constrained by tepid consumer spending.
 On Thursday, the eve of the release of the Labor Department's monthly employment snapshot, the government said the number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment increased to 480,000 last week, above Wall Street's estimates of 455,000. Analysts expect Friday's employment report to show that the jobless rate remained at 10 percent in January, and that 15,000 jobs were created.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index plunged 34.17 points, or 3.11 percent on Thursday, to 1,063.11, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 65.48 points, or 2.99 percent, to 2,125.43.
 How Europe decides to deal with its problems will shape its future political landscape -- and the future of the euro itself.
 Fearful investors have started asking whether France, Germany and other rich countries should be forced to bail out their poorer cousins, or simply allow them to default -- an outcome that would have major repercussions for Europe and financial markets worldwide. 
 The crisis in these areas ''is reaching new proportions, and the contagion effect is getting more serious,'' two Royal Bank of Scotland officials, Jacques Cailloux and Harvinder Sian, wrote in a note to investors.
 The current troubles began in Greece, which qualified for membership in the euro club in 2001. But the government never curbed shortfalls in its budget when times were good, and drastically expanded employment by adding to government rolls, even as an inefficient tax collection system reduced tax receipts. 
 While investors initially brushed off these problems, their worries resurfaced in October when the government conceded it had again buffed up its statistics to suggest a bright fiscal picture. Now, Greece has acknowledged its budget deficit stands at nearly 13 percent of gross domestic product, while debt levels are among the highest in the European Union -- well beyond what the rules of euro membership allow. 
 Greek officials are now trying to manage the country's deficit by partially freezing the pay of civil servants and increasing the fuel tax. 
 The European Union endorsed those measures on Wednesday, but the proposals have met resistance from other quarters. Greek customs and tax officials began a 48-hour walkout on Thursday, choking the flow of imports, and there were threats of more strikes.
 Meanwhile, the dispute has put Greece's credit rating under renewed threat, and stoked worries that Greek government bonds might no longer be accepted as collateral by the European Central Bank. 
 The president of the bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, sought to temper the doubts about Greece on Thursday. He cautioned, however, that large deficits could be a problem for other euro-zone countries, unsettling investors. ''When you share a common currency,'' Mr. Trichet warned, ''the counterpart is that you have to behave properly.''
 Nonetheless, Europe's politicians, and global investors, have become deeply unsettled about other European countries with huge debt and deficits, including Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Investors have been demanding bigger premiums to hold the debt of these countries, and this week drove the cost of insuring their debt to new highs. 
 These worries deepened Thursday as Spain, saddled with 19 percent unemployment and huge debt from an American-style housing bust, played down fears of a budget deficit that has ballooned to 11.4 percent of its gross domestic product. 
 Portugal, whose deficits have also spooked investors, suddenly had trouble raising as much short-term credit as it wanted. 
 There have been whispers that Europe's better-off countries -- France, Germany and the Netherlands among them -- might come to the rescue with a bailout. If they do not, economists worry about the ripple effects of a default. 
 ''There is a realization that the economy is still on very fragile footing globally,'' said David Riedel, founder of Riedel Research, which provides market analysis. ''There are definitely another couple of shoes to drop here with the European crisis.''
 Amid the tumult, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England left their benchmark interest rates unchanged at record lows of 1 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.
 But in an illustration of the ragged nature of Europe's recovery, the British central bank took steps to freeze measures to stimulate the economy. The bank, reacting to rising inflation and evidence that Britain has emerged from recession, announced that it would not extend its large purchases of government bonds.
 In the United States, interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note jumped 25/32, to 98 3/32 and the yield fell to 3.61 percent, from 3.70 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Stalled Health Care Bill Leaves Drug Makers in Regulatory Limbo

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
With the possible demise of health care legislation, getting back to business as usual may not be the best thing for the nation's drug makers. 
 After all, in return for the prospect of tens of millions of newly insured customers and a large degree of regulatory certainty, the pharmaceutical industry had agreed to pay a relatively small price: $8 billion a year in discounts and fees. It was a modest compromise for an industry with $246 billion in prescription drug sales last year. 
 But now, with the health care overhaul on a back burner in Washington and possibly dead for this year, drug makers are getting a sinking sense of how a piecemeal public policy future might look for them. 
 President Obama's proposed budget this week, for example, includes a plan he alluded to in last week's State of the Union address: a new tax on profits from some patents and other intangible assets parked in overseas tax havens by American companies. 
 For drug makers, which are among those most likely to be affected by such a tax, the president's proposal ''pretty much came out of the blue,'' said Martin A. Sullivan, an economist formerly with the Treasury Department and Joint Committee on Taxation. 
 Another expert agreed. ''Pharma's one that would really get hit,'' said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. ''That's a biggie.'' 
 The industry giant Pfizer, for example, which has said that 88 percent of its $56 billion in income from 2004 through 2008 originated overseas, could be subject to the corporate 35 percent tax rate on at least some of its foreign profit in the future if the president's proposal goes through. 
 Although the tax idea faced a cool reception from Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, it highlighted the risks to the drug industry of unpredictable election-year politics. It is a time when bolt-from-the-blue challenges may await drug makers, compared with the carefully mapped future they had worked out with the White House and the Senate under the health care legislation.
 As if to reinforce the continuing business challenges that drug makers face, regardless of carrots and sticks from Washington, Pfizer issued an earnings report and financial forecast this week that disappointed Wall Street. The report, on Wednesday, has helped send its shares down 6.3 percent in the last two days. 
 Pfizer lowered its 2010 and 2012 forecasts, citing the rising dollar and the sale or spinoff of some assets, including animal health products and an H.I.V. drug. The company also noted the coming patent expirations on some of its blockbuster drugs, including Lipitor, as well as growing competition from lower-priced generics.
 Several of the other big American drug companies reported a mixed bag of results last week. Johnson & Johnson posted a rare yearly decline in sales and gave a disappointing 2010 profit forecast. Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings per share beat analysts' estimates, helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Eli Lilly profit fell just short of expectations, and its shares declined as investors also showed concern about expirations of its drug patents. 
 The other big American drug maker, Merck, plans to report on Feb. 16. 
 None of those drug makers had forecast effects from a health care overhaul by Washington. But all of them had basically endorsed the Senate bill.
 Just last month, before the Republican candidate Scott Brown's victory in a special election in Massachusetts upended the Democrats' supermajority in the Senate, Pfizer's chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, told analysts that the Senate health care bill was ''largely consistent with the principles'' that were important to his industry.
 The drug industry had forecast lower revenue in the early years of its cost-savings deal, in which it agreed to pay $80 billion in rebates and fees over a decade. But its revenue and profit were expected to more than make up the difference later in that period as more than 30 million uninsured people began receiving health and drug coverage. 
 And just as important, the industry had received assurances from the Obama administration and some critical Congressional Democrats that long-feared proposals that might have popular appeal -- including government negotiation of Medicare drug prices and allowing the import of cheaper drugs from Canada -- would be tabled in return for drug makers' support of the rest of the health care overhaul. And some industry experts say any notions of an offshore tax had also been taken off the table.
 As part of the deal, the drug industry had also pledged and spent more than $100 million on TV advertising in support of the overhaul effort. 
 It is unlikely that the drug industry will run ads promoting President Obama's offshore tax proposal. Drug makers are fighting it through a Washington-based business coalition called Promote America's Competitive Edge, which includes many other multinationals. 
 The group argues that lower foreign tax rates create a level playing field for American companies and international competitors and, ultimately, save jobs in the United States.
 Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury economist who now writes about tax issues, said that all the big drug makers engage in offshore tax sheltering of one sort or another. And the portion of overseas profit and revenue has been growing in recent years. 
 ''Typically when a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug, it transfers it to a holding company in a tax haven like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, usually on very favorable terms,'' he said. ''There's a tremendous amount of income taken out of the U.S. and put into the tax haven. This proposal seems targeted to just that type of situation.''
 Pfizer has reported that 58 percent of its revenue came from overseas in 2008, compared with 39 percent a decade earlier. For other drug markets, overseas revenue in 2008 amounted to 46 percent for Lilly, 44 percent for Merck and 42 percent for Bristol-Myers. 
 Professor Gordon of the University of Michigan, who studies pharmaceutical companies, said the president's new plan to tax ''excessive'' offshore profits had surprised the industry and revealed the risks of a piecemeal health policy.
 ''The industry thought that it got some uncertainty off the table,'' Professor Gordon said. ''They're not thrilled about what happened in Massachusetts. It's not working to their advantage.''
 Some analysts, meanwhile, say parts of the $80 billion, 10-year deal could come back to bite the drug industry -- if it is held to some of the cost pledges without receiving the offsetting political protection. 
 The pact, for instance, committed the industry to support an increase in the rebate the government receives on Medicaid drugs -- to 23 percent, up from 15 percent currently. 
 In the current deficit-cutting environment, that discount may still look attractive to lawmakers. And it could conceivably be enacted by Congress at any time without being part of an industry quid pro quo. ''No question that's alive,'' said Seamus Fernandez, pharmaceutical industry analyst for the health care investment bank Leerink Swann. 
 But the overall health care reform package, he added, is ''either dead or severely hobbled.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Sketch Outline of Jobs Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Democratic leaders unveiled a new ''jobs agenda'' on Thursday morning, and said they hoped to hold a first vote on the legislation early next week. But they offered no details, and presented only a scant outline of proposals they might pursue, some of which echo initiatives they failed to include in last year's stimulus bill. 
 The core of the proposal is likely to be a payroll tax break for employers who hire workers who have been without jobs for at least 60 days. Democrats are trying to enlist Republican support for that idea, which was proposed most recently by Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. 
 But a senior aide to the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, quickly issued a statement questioning the Democrats' lack of specifics. ''They don't know what's in the bill or how many jobs they expect it to 'save or create' or when anyone beyond the Beltway will see it or how much it will cost,'' the aide, Don Stewart, said. 
 At a news conference on Thursday morning, the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, and other top Democrats distributed a two and a half page document listing some of their ideas for spurring job creation, including the tax cut for new hires, an extension of unemployment benefits and spending on highways and other infrastructure. 
 The list also included grants for school building renovations nationwide, a proposal that Democrats fought hard to include in last year's $787 billion economic stimulus package, but that was opposed by Republicans who supplied the key votes needed to pass the measure, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine.
 Mr. Reid, asked after the news conference if the Democrats' jobs agenda was an acknowledgement that the stimulus measure was not big enough, snapped: ''''Don't talk to me. Talk to the Republicans about how big it was, ok? Don't talk to me.''
 An aide to Mr. Reid, Jim Manley, said that Senate Democrats would like to put forward a ''robust'' jobs package, similar to a bill approved in December by the House, which would spend $174 billion, including $75 billion taken from the financial bailout program, and use it for job creation efforts including highway construction, school renovation and hiring of new teachers, police officers and firefighters. 
 But Mr. Manley said that Democrats were virtually powerless to advance such legislation because Republicans would block it. He said that more details about the Democrats' package might be available on Thursday afternoon. 
 Senator-elect Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, is expected to be sworn in on Thursday afternoon. He will become the 41st Republican in the Senate, giving the minority party a sufficient number of votes to successfully filibuster most legislation. 
 Economists generally urge that government stimulus efforts be ''timely, targeted and temporary'' a buzz phrase that Democrats repeated frequently last year. But with an economic recovery already underway, the Democrats said that Americans were still demanding that they focus on job creation. 
 ''If we are going to get our economy back on track,'' Mr. Reid said, ''people have to go back to work.'' 
 But Mr. Reid did not say how much the Democrats' jobs legislation would cost, how lawmakers planned to pay for it, or even how many jobs he hoped to create. ''We're going to create as many as we can,'' Mr. Reid said. 
 Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said that party leaders had been working for two months to develop job proposals. ''There were a lot of very good ideas that came forward,'' he said.
 Mr. Durbin urged Republicans to come forward with their own proposals. 
 ''This is a good faith offering on the Democratic side,'' he said. ''We're inviting our friends on the Republican side to join us, bring your best ideas forward. Let's put these on the floor and move on them with a sense of urgency. We need to have a jobs agenda that will pass through the Senate, that will create jobs across America as quickly as possible.''

HEADLINE: Industry Lobbying Imperils Obama Overhaul of Student Loans

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 -- Four months ago, it appeared all but certain that the White House and Democrats in Congress would succeed in overhauling the student loan business and ending government subsidies to private lenders.
 President Obama called the idea a ''no-brainer'' last fall, predicting it would take billions of dollars from the profits of private lenders and give it directly to students, and many colleges were already moving to get loans directly from the federal government in anticipation of the next move by Congress. 
 But an aggressive lobbying campaign by the nation's biggest student lenders has now put one of the White House's signature plans in peril, with lenders using sit-downs with lawmakers, town-hall-style meetings and petition drives to plead their case and stay in business. 
 House and Senate aides say that the administration's plan faces a far tougher fight than it did last fall, when the House passed its version. The fierce attacks from the lending industry, the Massachusetts election that cost the Democrats their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and the fight over a health care bill have all damaged the chances for the student loan measure, said the aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. 
 But they said the administration had recognized the threat and was beginning to push back in an effort to get the plan approved. 
 Sallie Mae, a publicly traded company that is the nation's biggest student lender with $22 billion in loans originated last year, led the field in spending $8 million on lobbying in 2009, more than double the year before, and other lenders spent millions of dollars more, according to an analysis prepared for The New York Times by the Center for Responsive Politics. 
 Political action committees for the lenders and company employees made $2.1 million in political contributions last year, with the money split evenly among Democrat and Republican candidates, the data showed. Sallie Mae's PAC alone made $194,000 in donations.
 Some 10 million students got loans last year to help pay for their educations, and there is disagreement about whether having the federal government take over virtually the entire lending program would help or hurt them. Private lenders warn that students may default on their loans more often because they will get less counseling; the Obama administration says students will benefit from more grants and expanded educational programs.
 A defeat for the White House at the hands of the industry could become further evidence of the administration's sagging political fortunes. The unexpected loss of the Massachusetts Senate seat has given opponents of the lending plan an opportunity that seemed unlikely last September, when the House approved legislation to move to a federally-sponsored loan program. 
 The student loan industry, which would be forced out of the loan origination business if the proposal became law, is seeking to cast the administration's plan as an ill-conceived government takeover that could put thousands of people out of work at private lending centers around the country at a time when unemployment is hovering around 10 percent.
 ''We anticipated this,'' Arne Duncan, the education secretary, said of the lending industry's lobbying efforts. ''They've had a sweet deal. They've had this phenomenal deal that taxpayers have subsidized, and that's a hard thing to give up.''
 Private lenders get a cut of the federally backed loans that they originate and service, with little risk of their own. At Sallie Mae, lobbyists for the firm are focusing on senators regarded as fiscal conservatives, as well as those in states that are home to lending centers with jobs at stake, including Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York and Pennsylvania, said John F. Remondi, chief financial officer for the company. 
 Student loan lenders employ about 35,000 people around the country, although estimates differ as to how many jobs would be eliminated if the federal government took over all direct lending on student loans. 
 ''We haven't left any stone unturned -- we'll meet with anyone who will meet us,'' Mr. Remondi said in an interview. ''We're trying to identify at least 12 senators who would be helpful in this process.''
 At the same time, Sallie Mae and other lenders have staged a series of town-hall-style meetings at their job centers around the country to help mobilize opposition to the White House plan and collect thousands of signatures for a petition drive in support of their own plan. 
 ''I would think that the White House would prefer not to make senators vote for something that is going to be very unpopular in their states -- and for good reason,'' said Jamie Gorelick, a former Clinton administration official who is now lobbying for the lending industry.
 Mr. Obama defended his plan last week in his State of the Union address. 
 ''To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans'' and use the savings to finance other educational programs, he said to cheers from Democrats. ''In the United States of America,'' Mr. Obama said, ''no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.'' 
 The money that would be saved by cutting out the private-industry middlemen -- about $80 billion over the next decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis -- could instead go toward expanding direct Pell Grants to students, establishing $10,000 tax credits for families with loans, and forgiving debts eventually for students who go into public service, administration officials say. 
 The bill would also shift tens of billions of dollars in expected savings to early learning programs, community colleges and the modernization of public school facilities. 
 Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who has led the fight for the lending overhaul as chairman of the House Education Committee, predicted in an interview that the plan would ultimately pass. 
 ''If people want to lose $80 billion on the taxpayer's dime for the very narrow interests of Sallie Mae, I guess they can decide that, but it makes no economic sense to me,'' he said. ''They had a great ride for years.''
 If Congress backs Mr. Obama's proposal, opponents say that students will forfeit the individualized service that private lenders are better able to offer: a one-on-one meeting in a high school gym, a range of loan options to pick from, or an 11th-hour meeting to avoid a default. The lenders have offered an alternative proposal to retain a more active role in originating loans, which they say would generate significant federal savings -- $67 billion in the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 Some financial-aid administrators at colleges around the country say they are worried that the political uncertainty over the loan proposal and the one-size-fits-all approach of the White House's approach could hurt colleges and students. 
 ''We're caught in a political struggle,'' Caesar Storlazzi, the chief financial aid officer at Yale, said in an interview. Like a wave of other colleges in recent months, Yale decided in November to switch from private-sector loans to the federal government's direct-lending program.
 But with passage of the White House plan now appearing ''less inevitable,'' Mr. Storlazzi wonders whether keeping the private lenders in business is better for students.
 ''It really felt like the administration was just shoving this down our throats,'' he said. ''It feels a bit like a federal takeover.'' With competition among lenders, he said, ''We get better prices and services.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 5 about the student lending industry's lobbying against changes to the loan system, using information from the Center for Responsive Politics, a private campaign-finance research group, misstated the amount of money the student lender Sallie Mae spent on federal lobbying in recent years. Sallie Mae reported having spent a total of $3.48 million in federal lobbying in 2009, an increase from $3.2 million in 2008. It did not spend $8 million in 2009.

HEADLINE: A Bipartisan Plan for a Tax Break to Create Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Senators Charles E. Schumer and Orrin G. Hatch make the case for a Social Security payroll-tax holiday for hiring the unemployed (''A Payroll Tax Break for Jobs,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 26). 
 While I admire the intention and the simplicity of their plan, it would have little or no impact on hiring and could needlessly increase the federal budget deficit.
 Currently, the biggest issue for businesses is the lack of demand for their products. No business would increase its hiring, and therefore its costs, when it is facing flat or declining revenue. 
 The tax credit is not large enough to offset the costs of hiring. In fact, as the writers indicate, the tax credit would offset only 6.2 percent of the increased cost to business. Its only effect would be to provide tax reductions to businesses that would have hired anyway without the incentive.
 A much more effective role for the federal government would be to stimulate demand, by increasing stimulus spending to create sales opportunities for businesses. When businesses see sustained increases in sales and revenue, they will naturally turn to hiring more workers to satisfy that demand.
 Thomas Goldsworthy New York, Jan. 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The job-creation proposal that Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican, and Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, laid out is a rare breath of fresh air in the current poisonous political atmosphere suffocating Congress.
 It brings to mind the old stricture ''politics stops at the water's edge'' that used to restrain Washington politicians from politicizing foreign policy. Only now I would rephrase it to say ''bipartisanship starts at disaster's edge.''
 Let's hope that the Hatch-Schumer proposal means that wiser heads have seen the danger and will prevail in legislating our economy back from the edge of the cliff that it is still teetering on.

HEADLINE: China Rejects U.S. Complaints on Its Currency

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and MARK LANDLER; Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Mark Landler from Washington.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
A senior Chinese official said on Thursday that China would not bow to pressure from the United States to revalue its currency, which President Obama says is kept at an artificially low level to give China an unfair advantage in selling its exports. 
 The official, Ma Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a regular news conference here that ''wrongful accusations and pressure will not help solve this issue.'' 
 Mr. Ma was reacting to remarks on trade that Mr. Obama made on Wednesday when he met with Democratic senators in Washington. Mr. Obama stopped short of saying China manipulates its currency, but his words on China's economic policies were harsh -- the United States, he said, had ''to make sure our goods are not artificially inflated in price and their goods are not artificially deflated in price; that puts us at a huge competitive disadvantage.'' 
 Economists agree with that assessment. They say that the Chinese currency, the renminbi, is undervalued by 25 to 40 percent compared to the dollar and other currencies. The gap is wider than at any time since July 2005, when the Chinese government, under pressure from the Bush administration, decided to do away with the renminbi's peg to the dollar and allow the currency to float in a narrow band against the dollar and other currencies. 
 The renminbi appreciated 21 percent, but since July 2008 it has remained at the same value -- today, one dollar equals about 6.83 renminbi, also called the yuan. 
 ''Judging from the international balance of payments and the currency market's supply and demand, the value of the renminbi is getting to a reasonable and balanced level,'' Mr. Ma said on Thursday. 
 The sharp exchange over China's currency is only the latest symptom of rising tensions in American relations with China. Internet censorship, hacking attacks directed at American companies, arms sales to Taiwan and the pending visit of the Dalai Lama to Washington have all cropped up in the last month as points of conflict. China is exhibiting a brash sense of confidence as its economy continues to boom while much of the world remains mired in a recession. 
 On economics, Chinese officials now regularly lecture their American counterparts on the need to maintain the value of the American dollar. China, which has more than $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, is the largest holder of American debt. On Wednesday, Xinhua, the official state news agency, .the official state news agency said Chinese economists were concerned that the American government, suffering from a record budget deficit, could print more dollars and issue more bonds, eroding the value of the dollar. 
 The finger-wagging from the American side is almost certain to intensify too. With midterm elections this fall, Mr. Obama is under pressure to alleviate the high unemployment rate in the United States. Mr. Obama said last week in his State of the Union address that he hoped to double American exports within five years. 
 In China, the export industry is a large employer in the coastal regions and draws hordes of migrant workers from interior provinces. Exports have slowed considerably since the global financial crisis began, and Chinese leaders and economists have been saying that domestic consumption should become a larger part of the economy. 
 Last year, the Chinese economy grew by 8.7 percent, surpassing the 8 percent benchmark set by the government and indicating that China was managing to push through the global recession with little damage. A large driver of the growth was domestic spending -- the Chinese government announced in November 2008 a stimulus package worth $585 billion. 
 But the spending, along with in-flows of foreign currency through private investments and speculation, what some economists call ''hot money,'' is fueling inflation. The consumer price index in the fourth quarter of 2009 rose 1.9 percent. Fears of an overheated economy could lead the Chinese government to revalue the renminbi later this year to help contain inflation. 
 In late January, Jim O'Neill, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told Bloomberg News that he expected the Chinese government to make a one-off revaluation of the renminbi, letting it appreciate by at least five percent before the end of 2010. He said the revaluation would happen suddenly, without any warning from Chinese leaders. 
 Reopening the battle with Beijing over its currency may pay political dividends for Mr. Obama at a time of double-digit unemployment and growing fears that China is stealing American jobs. But experts say the president will have even less leverage over Beijing than President George W. Bush did. Mr. Bush prodded China for years to adjust its exchange rate with little success.
 China, they say, is determined to reignite its export machine after a global recession that sapped demand for Chinese goods. A cheap currency is vital to that goal. And as indicated by Mr. Ma's statement on Thursday, China's leaders have grown impatient with lectures on economic policy from their chief debtor, the United States.
 ''It will be like water off a duck's back,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''They're puzzled by the criticism. They think they should be praised for keeping their currency stable at a time of global turmoil.''
 Criticizing China's policy, however, is likely to worsen a relationship already frayed by irritants on both sides.
 In two weeks, Mr. Obama is expected to meet with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, over the objections of the Chinese, who condemn him as a subversive. The administration forged ahead with sales of weapons to Taiwan, drawing an angry blast from Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a breakaway province. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized China for censoring the Internet, in the wake of Google's allegations about hacking.
 For its part, the United States is frustrated that the Chinese will not back tougher sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. And China has resisted American initiatives on climate change policy, turning the recent climate meeting in Copenhagen into a diplomatic drama.
 The administration has struggled to prevent the ill will from any single issue from contaminating the broader relationship. ''We can't pick the timing of when an issue becomes important,'' said a senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter.
 Exchange rates are an arcane subject, harder to explain than a meeting with the Dalai Lama. But they influence easy-to-understand issues like the competitiveness of American exports and job security.
 ''The currency issue has the potential to become a very hot political issue,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, who worked on China policy in the Clinton White House. ''We're in significant danger of hitting a very rough patch in trade relations, in the latter part of this year.''

HEADLINE: Making 'No Child' Better

 BODY:
Like most ambitious federal reforms, the No Child Left Behind Education Act of 2002 will need to be revised, perhaps several times, before it reaches maximum effectiveness. Without formally announcing them, the Obama administration has made clear that it wants changes in the law, which could be reauthorized this year. For starters, it would like more effective mechanisms for intervening in failing schools and ways to reward schools that make rapid improvements. 
 But it will be no less important to protect what is good in the law and resist pressure from powerful forces -- teachers' unions, state governments and other groups -- that may seek to weaken it. In particular, the administration and Congress need to preserve and strengthen provisions that hold states accountable for placing a qualified teacher in every classroom and closing the achievement gap between poor children and their wealthy contemporaries.
 Critics like to say that No Child Left Behind, former President George W. Bush's signature education law, has failed. But for all its flaws, the law has focused the country on student achievement as never before. The program got off to a poor start. States were allowed to keep unqualified teachers and phony up graduation rates, and test scores are still not where they should be. But the achievement gap will continue to narrow if we keep working at it. 
 Before No Child Left Behind, most states covered up the gap by simply not reporting or analyzing test score data by race, gender or income. The law ended that practice by requiring states to provide yearly breakdowns of student achievement data along racial, ethnic and economic lines. Schools that fail to meet measurable achievement targets in math and reading can be forced into restructuring.
 Even so, improvements are in order. Education Secretary Arne Duncan notes that the current law fails to distinguish between schools that miss their targets because they are permanently mired in failure and schools that miss their targets but are still making rapid progress. The administration and Congress should find a way to recognize and reward schools that are moving forward without opening the floodgates to a new round of fraud and evasion. 
 In addition, a little-known loophole known as the safe harbor provision allows schools that miss their goals to claim to have met them through statistical sleight of hand. This loophole should be closed. 
 In the end, the administration's most important task will be holding the line against critics who complain that the law is too onerous. Recently, for instance, Mr. Duncan seemed to back away from a crucial provision in the law that requires schools to make progress along a prescribed timeline in exchange for federal dollars.
 He was roundly criticized for this, though he later said that he was misinterpreted. Giving up on the idea of linking federal dollars to measurable progress would take us back to the bad-old days when education reform consisted of vague aspirations with no action plans, no timelines and, ultimately, few results.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Sues Bank of America, Even as It Settles With S.E.C.

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The legal drama surrounding the controversial takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, one of the pivotal moments of the financial crisis, took a fresh turn on Thursday as the attorney general of New York leveled civil fraud charges against Kenneth D. Lewis, the former Bank of America chief who masterminded the deal. 
 But no sooner did that news break than the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had struck a new, $150 million deal with Bank of America to settle its own cases involving the merger. Moments later, North Carolina's attorney general announced that his office also had reached a settlement. 
 The developments open several new fronts in one of the most closely watched legal battles in American finance -- one that now pits Wall Street enforcers against each other. 
 Andrew M. Cuomo, New York's attorney general, is upping the ante in a match against Mr. Lewis and Bank of America. The S.E.C., however, is eager to put the matter to rest after suffering embarrassing setbacks in its case. Bank of America insists its executives did no wrong, although it, too, wants to put the case behind it. 
 Mr. Cuomo, who is expected to run for governor of New York and has been investigating the case for a year, is riding the wave of popular anger directed at big banks, which have stunned many Americans with their quick recovery from the financial collapse. Much like the S.E.C., his office claims that Bank of America essentially hid from its shareholders billions of dollars in losses at Merrill, which later forced Bank of America to seek a second bailout from Washington. 
 But unlike the S.E.C., which has focused broadly on Bank of America itself, Mr. Cuomo has focused instead on Mr. Lewis and another executive, Joe Price, who was Bank of America's chief financial officer when the Merrill deal was struck. The fallout from the star-crossed deal eventually drove Mr. Lewis from his post as chief executive. Mr. Price remains at the bank, though he stepped down from the chief financial officer job this year. 
 Lawyers for both Mr. Lewis and Mr. Price said the charges were without merit. The bank is paying both executives' legal fees.
 ''Mr. Lewis has been unfairly vilified by the political search for accountability for the financial meltdown,'' said Mary Jo White, a lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton who represents Mr. Lewis.
 Mr. Cuomo made some new claims in a 90-page complaint filed on Thursday. The complaint painted Mr. Price as the central figure in the case. Mr. Cuomo accused Mr. Price of hiding the extent of Merrill's losses from Bank of America's own lawyers when seeking advice on whether to update shareholders about the deepening pool of red ink. 
 One Bank of America executive commented in a note about the losses that read ''read and weep,'' the complaint says.
 Mr. Cuomo is wielding a powerful weapon in his case. Under New York State's Martin Act, the attorney general has broad powers in securities enforcement.
 The S.E.C., meantime, is seeking to bring its long, troubled investigation to an end. But its new settlement is subject to approval by United States District Judge Jed S. Rakoff -- the same judge who rejected a previous $33 million accord as woefully low and, in blistering terms, accused the S.E.C. of going too easy on Bank of America and its executives. 
 Judge Rakoff will hold a hearing on the new settlement on Monday.
 Legal experts said that many controversial issues stemming from the financial crisis -- rich bonuses for bankers, allegations of government fraud, potential harm to investors -- come together in the Merrill-Bank of America case. 
 Lawmakers in Congress used the merger as an opportunity to interrogate the leaders of the Federal Reserve and Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was Treasury secretary when the merger was struck. 
 ''This transaction had nothing to do with causing the crisis; this transaction helped solve it,'' said Steven Thel, a professor at Fordham University School of Law. ''But everything that people think has gone wrong in the last few years is tied up in this transaction. People are upset because they see this as the tawdry side of the bailout. It shows the qualities of Wall Street.''
 Bank of America directors pressed in recent months to settle both cases. But Mr. Cuomo was unwilling to settle for a small sum and wanted Mr. Lewis and Mr. Price held accountable. The bank seized on the S.E.C.'s decision not to charge individuals as evidence that Mr. Cuomo's case was without merits. 
 ''The S.E.C. and the attorney general's office looked at the same evidence and the S.E.C. concluded there was no reason to charge people,'' said Bob Stickler, a spokesman for the bank. ''The evidence demonstrates that Bank of America and its executives, including Ken Lewis and Joe Price, at all times acted in good faith and consistent with their legal and fiduciary obligations.''
 The S.E.C. said it would distribute the fine it was seeking from Bank of America to shareholders who owned Bank of America stock at the time of the merger. Former Merrill shareholders, in other words, will effectively pay the fine. The settlement also includes some corporate governance reforms, which have appealed to Judge Rakoff in past settlements.
 If the judge rejects the settlement, the S.E.C. and the bank are scheduled to try the case beginning March 1. 
 People following Mr. Cuomo's case said that the attorney general's showdown with Bank of America would probably drag on for some time. 
 ''This is certainly not the end, and it's more likely the beginning of a long, drawn-out death march,'' said Michael W. Robinson, a senior vice president with Levick Strategic Communications. ''Attorney General Cuomo has found an issue that neatly ties together populist anger and a sense of the malfeasance of bankers, who are not the most popular people these days.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Falls to 9.7%, Giving Hope Worst Is Over

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN; Javier C. Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The unemployment rate unexpectedly dipped to 9.7 percent in January, from 10 percent in December, the government reported Friday, buoying hopes that the worst job market in at least a quarter-century is finally improving.
 But a different survey in the Labor Department's report found that the economy lost 20,000 net jobs during the month, muddying the picture and underscoring the formidable struggles still confronting millions of Americans. Yet with the pace of decline slowing, most experts focused on signs that the economy was recovering after the longest recession since the Great Depression.
 Manufacturing added 11,000 jobs in January, the first monthly increase since November 2007, while the length of the average workweek rose slightly at factories. The economy added 52,000 temporary workers, and average wages increased modestly, amplifying the view that commercial activity is reawakening after two years of hibernation.
 ''The economy is continuing to improve,'' said John E. Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, N.C. ''You don't have a boom, but you have an economic recovery. It's a positive sign.'' 
 Despite encouraging indications for the future, the government's monthly snapshot of the labor market revealed that last year's collapse was considerably more severe than previously recorded. And the report came wrapped in substantial statistical uncertainty, intensifying debate about the staying power and vigor of the apparent recovery.
 The Labor Department revised previous data to show that the economy contained 1.36 million fewer jobs in December, a downward adjustment of roughly 1 percent. The revisions showed the economy lost 150,000 jobs in December, far more than the 85,000 initially reported.
 In calculating the unemployment rate, the report used new census estimates of the population, an annual adjustment. That prompted some economists to dismiss the drop in the jobless rate as a statistical quirk, though the Labor Department said the change was negligible.
 ''Everyone goes crazy over today's number,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. in New York, ''but history has been rewritten.''
 Mr. Shapiro focused on the economic anxiety and tight finances that still grip many households, suggesting this would dampen consumer spending, which represents more than two-thirds of the economy. That would keep employers reluctant to hire.
 ''The question is, what is the rate of improvement going to be?'' he asked. ''Very slow.''
 The Obama administration portrayed the report as grounds for cautious optimism. 
 ''It's somewhat encouraging,'' said Christina D. Romer, who leads the president's council of economic advisers. ''The overall number is too high. You can't look at 9.7 percent unemployment and say that's anything but a tragedy.''
 Ms. Romer acknowledged that she and her colleagues failed to grasp the magnitude of the employment crisis last year when putting together a $787 billion package of spending measures aimed at stimulating economic growth. The administration had assumed that without the stimulus the unemployment rate would top out at 8.9 percent by the end of last year, considerably below the 10.1 percent rate reached in October, which now represents the peak.
 ''Forecasting is a difficult business,'' she said, adding that she felt ''pretty confident'' the economy would produce sustained job growth by the spring. 
 Economists remain divided on that prognosis. Some envision the jobless rate reaching nearly 11 percent by the end of the year, which would raise the prospect of new shocks to the system: a retreat in consumer spending and renewed fears in the banking system as jobless people lose the wherewithal to pay their mortgages.
 Such visions are at the center of concerns that the end of this recession may signal the beginning of a long period of disappointingly slow growth, or perhaps just a pause before another downturn.
 Construction continued to suffer in January, losing 75,000 net jobs. Transportation and warehousing lost 19,000 net jobs. State and local governments collectively lost 41,000 jobs.
 Small companies complain that loans remain exceedingly difficult to secure, limiting their ability to expand and hire. The Obama administration is seeking Congressional approval for a measure that would direct $30 billion toward loans for small businesses.
 In Cleveland, Kirk K. Meurer, the owner of an office furniture store with 30 employees, has frozen wages and stopped buying new cars to trim costs. He has a $250,000 line of credit, but complains that it has been difficult to persuade his bank to lend more.
 ''I'm being very frugal with my decisions,'' Mr. Meurer said. ''For us to hire, we need to see a turn in the economy.''
 Many economists saw in Friday's jobs report heartening signs that such a turn had arrived.
 For months, American businesses have expanded their production while continuing to shrink the work force. The January data -- particularly the increase in manufacturing and the hours worked -- suggested that employers finally felt enough confidence in expanding business opportunities to add to their payrolls.
 Health care, long a bright spot in a dismal economy, grew by 17,000 jobs. Retailing gained 42,000 jobs, and professional and business services added 44,000.
 ''We've seen a surge in demand for graphic designers and people who create display advertising for the Web,'' said Fabio Rosati, chief executive of Elance, an online job market for freelance computer programmers and other tech-related workers. ''There's been an increase in confidence among employers.''
 Adding to the sense that employers are finally inclined to add labor, the number of so-called involuntary part-time workers -- people who cannot find full-time jobs, or whose hours have been cut -- fell to 8.3 million in January, from 9.2 million.
 But even among the signs of improvement, the report presented unambiguous evidence that these remain grim days for millions of ordinary people.
 The unemployment rate reached 16.5 percent among African-Americans, 12.6 percent among Hispanics, and 26.4 percent among teenagers.
 ''African-Americans and Latinos continue to bear the brunt of this economic recession,'' Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, said in a written statement. ''We cannot in good conscience welcome these numbers without acknowledging the disparity that exists between the general population and communities of color.''
 The so-called underemployment rate -- which counts involuntary part-time workers along with people who have given up looking for jobs -- was 16.5 percent in January. That amounted to an improvement from the 17.3 percent a month earlier, yet it was nearly double the level of three years ago.
 Those who have been out of work for six months or longer swelled to 6.3 million in January, from 6.1 million in December, the highest level since the government began tracking such data in 1948.
 ''Things are getting bad less rapidly,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''We're sort of hitting bottom, but there is no evidence of a robust turnaround.''

HEADLINE: At Art Supplier, Uncertainty as Stores Close

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
For years the cluster of Pearl Paint stores in Lower Manhattan -- one in a cast-iron building on Canal Street and two in the next block, on Lispenard Street -- have been the supply depots where artists found their next blank canvas, that extra tube of cerulean blue or another quart of turpenoid, an odorless substitute for turpentine.
 ''It's like a household word for students: 'I'll go to Pearl, get it cheaper,' '' said Robert Cenedella, an instructor at the Art Students League of New York and a painter. ''The key word is cheap, on sale, and they have everything. There's hardly anything you couldn't get there.'' 
 Now it appears that Pearl, founded in the Great Depression, will not survive the Great Recession unscathed. 
 The company is closing one of the three Manhattan stores and several others around the country. The closings seem to have come suddenly: glossy brochures on a rack at the front of the Canal Street store still list 18 stores nationwide.
 The company's Web site says eight stores are open -- the two in Manhattan and two each in New Jersey, Florida and California. 
 But the store in Iselin, N.J., is also being shut down. A clerk who answered the telephone there said she had not been told when the last day would be. Pearl's two stores on Long Island, in Westbury and Selden, have already closed, as has the one in Cambridge, Mass. 
 The two in California, in San Francisco and Los Angeles, are running deep-discount sales like those in the final days of the stores that are now gone. Repeated calls to Pearl's corporate office in Florida were not returned. 
 ''They operate in an industry that's not really moving at the moment,'' said Toon van Beeck, a senior industry analyst for IBISWorld, a market research company. The store closings are ''probably a wise move at this stage even though it's painful,'' he added. ''Short-term pain, long-term gain, that's the idea behind it.''
 In the absence of word from the company itself, rumors are flying among artists -- rumors that the sales clerks have heard over and over, rumors that even the Canal Street store itself is in danger. 
 ''I'm working here 11 years,'' one employee said, taking a cigar break under a ''no loitering'' sign outside the Canal Street store. ''There have been rumors for 11 years. We'll be here forever.''
 Pearl appears to be closing the store at 58 Lispenard Street, where it once took orders for framing. On Thursday afternoon, some workers were dismantling the shelves in the store while others wheeled away hand trucks loaded with the makings of frames -- corners and long, straight pieces. A woman behind the counter told customers that Pearl was giving up its custom-framing business but that the Canal Street store would sell ready-made frames.
 Mr. Cenedella said that was more definite than the subtler indications of tough times he had sometimes noticed. ''Often they've seemed like they were going out of business,'' Mr. Cenedella said. ''About four months ago the shelves were almost empty, but now they're full again.'' (The cigar-smoking clerk provided a possible explanation: As the other stores closed, ''we got all their stuff,'' meaning merchandise that was not sold at deeper-than-usual discounts.)
 The uncertainty on the customers' side of the cash register is matched by the uncertainty on the clerks' side. ''Today we have jobs,'' one clerk told a customer on Thursday. ''Don't know about tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Toyota's Top Executive Under Rising Pressure

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI and BILL VLASIC; Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Nagoya, Japan, and Bill Vlasic from Detroit. Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: NAGOYA, Japan 

 BODY:
When Akio Toyoda took control last summer of the company started by his grandfather, his challenge was to lead Toyota out of its worst financial crisis in half a century.
 That, it turned out, was the easy part.
 Since last fall, Mr. Toyoda and his top United States executives have been struggling to find the words to calm consumers about the safety of Toyota's cars, and it is proving to be a far more difficult task than fixing the company's finances. 
 After the first big recall of Toyota vehicles last fall, Mr. Toyoda said publicly that the company was a step away from ''capitulation to irrelevance or death.'' The company, he added, was ''grasping for salvation.'' 
 He briefly apologized last week while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. And with concerns growing about safety issues in more models, he apologized again Friday at a hastily arranged news conference, where he said Toyota would establish a high-level committee to study the problems.
 ''I came out here today because I would not want our customers to spend the weekend wondering whether their cars are safe,'' he said.
 But his statements are unlikely to quell the mounting concerns of Toyota owners, as well as American government officials.
 A House committee will hold a hearing on Toyota safety in Washington next week, when the company will again be pressed publicly about its handling of safety issues.
 The company has recalled about nine million cars worldwide, and reports are growing of fatal accidents involving possibly defective Toyota vehicles. 
 Communications experts said that so far, the company has failed to convey confidence that it has a plan to fix its problems.
 ''I am shocked at how badly they have handled this,'' said Paul A. Argenti, a professor of corporate communications at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. ''You would expect a company of this size and stature to roll out a plan to repair problems that have the potential to bring this company down.''
 Until Friday, Mr. Toyoda had delegated the task of reassuring American consumers to executives from the company's United States sales arm. 
 Last November, one of the executives, Robert S. Carter, tried to halt the crisis by saying that Toyota's only safety problem was floor mats in its cars that could interfere with the accelerator pedal.
 Mr. Carter was almost immediately rebuked by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which called his comments ''misleading.''
 Then, on Monday, another American executive, James E. Lentz III, took the lead in announcing that the company had developed a fix for accelerator pedals that could stick in 2.3 million recalled vehicles.
 However, Mr. Lentz's appearances on the ''Today Show'' and other news programs raised questions as to why Mr. Toyoda or other senior Japanese executives were unavailable to address the crisis, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a Yale University professor and president of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute.
 By putting Mr. Lentz out front, Toyota was sending a regional sales executive to do a job that needed to be handled by the top management of the entire corporation, he said.
 ''By all accounts he's a good guy, but he doesn't have any of the operational reach or responsibilities to speak to most of these issues,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said. Mr. Lentz is not well known even in auto circles. For many years, Toyota's American face was James E. Press, who was familiar to the national media and adept at both pitching cars and defending the company from critics. 
 But Mr. Press left the company in 2007 to join Chrysler, and another experienced marketing executive, James D. Farley, departed that same year to work for the Ford Motor Company. 
 Mr. Lentz ''is not a known quantity, and he wasn't able to reassure people that this problem was being addressed,'' said Arthur C. Liebler, a former Chrysler vice president and top communications adviser to Lee Iacocca. 
 Mr. Liebler recalled how Mr. Iacocca used his personality and fame to Chrysler's advantage when the company faced a scandal of selling used cars as new models in the 1980s. 
 ''Lee attacked it head-on by saying, 'We screwed up, we made a mistake, and we're going to fix it,' '' Mr. Liebler added. 
 Until Friday, Mr. Toyoda's only public comment since the second major recall was an apology that came in a brief interview with a Japanese broadcaster on the sidelines of the economic forum in Davos. 
 ''What is he doing in Davos anyway?'' said Mr. Argenti of the Tuck School of Business. ''If you've got a crisis of this magnitude, you get on a plane and you go to the scene of the problem.''
 At his news conference Friday, Mr. Toyoda signaled after about 30 minutes that he was ready to leave until reporters implored him to stay. 
 At one point, he balked at answering a question about whether the company has ever withheld information related to safety concerns. ''Toyota is committed to safety,'' he said.
 Asked why he would not be attending Congressional hearings, Mr. Toyoda said, ''Whoever attends from Toyota, we speak with one voice.''
 At next Wednesday's hearing, that voice is expected to be Yoshimi Inaba, a veteran company executive who is responsible for all of Toyota's North American operations.
 Mr. Sonnenfeld said Mr. Toyoda himself should be at the hearings. 
 ''The person who's accountable is the C.E.O.,'' he said. ''He needs to be here.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Financial Adviser Is Sued by Wesleyan

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
As the economy eroded college endowments around the country, money managers in academia worked tirelessly to contain the damage. Everywhere, that is, but at Wesleyan University, at least according to a lawsuit that the university has brought against its former chief investment officer.
 In a complaint that represents an unusual airing of alleged ivory tower impropriety, Wesleyan has accused Thomas Kannam, whom it hired in 1998 to oversee its endowment, of spending most of his time on outside business ventures, despite having a contract that clearly prohibited that.
 The lawsuit, filed in late November in State Superior Court in Middletown, Conn., quotes e-mail messages from and to Mr. Kannam to portray him as a money-obsessed bureaucrat who exploited Wesleyan's prestige and resources to boost his personal wealth. In one example, Mr. Kannam asked a business associate about their potential engagement with a new hedge fund that involved Michael Zaninovich. 
 ''Through my portfolio at Wesleyan, I have a window on some very interesting stock ideas,'' Mr. Kannam wrote, according to the lawsuit. ''If possible, I'd like to cherry-pick the best and capitalize on them. Would it be possible to set up an arrangement whereby we feed ideas to Mike's hedge fund and get paid some incentive on the performance of our ideas? Might be the fastest way to make some real dough.''
 In the late 1990s, Wesleyan decided to address the nagging problem of its endowment, which had slipped behind those of its peers. It brought in Mr. Kannam, a young money manager with an M.B.A. from Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business and a resume that included managing money for Exxon and Dartmouth.
 Mr. Kannam, then 33, became Wesleyan's first in-house investment strategist. In a glowing 2006 profile in the alumni magazine, Mr. Kannam was praised for meeting the goal set by the university's president: putting Wesleyan's return on its endowment in the top 5 of the 20 highest-rated liberal arts colleges in the annual U.S. News & World Report survey.
 Since the financial crisis, Wesleyan's endowment has contracted along with everyone else's, falling 24 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2009. A spokesman, David Pesci, said the endowment was now worth about $530 million.
 According to the lawsuit, Mr. Kannam was expected to devote ''his complete professional time and energies'' to the university. The president of Wesleyan, Michael S. Roth, had given Mr. Kannam permission to serve on only the boards of two community service organizations, the suit said.
 Matthew Hamill, senior vice president of the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said that moonlighting by college investment officers was not typical. ''I'm not familiar with other institutions where a chief investment officer might have done the kinds of things that Wesleyan has alleged,'' he said.
 Mr. Kannam, who was fired from Wesleyan in October, was named in the suit along with his wife, Heather L. McCutchen, a playwright he met while they were students at Dartmouth. Also named were several business associates and investment companies. Wesleyan is seeking $3 million in damages.
 Messages left on a phone listed in Mr. Kannam's name in Durham, Conn., were not returned. However, a lawyer for Mr. Kannam, Stephen J. Fitzgerald, defended his client, saying, ''There's not a single allegation in Wesleyan's complaint that a single dollar of endowment money was misappropriated or somehow invested improperly in violation of any conflict of interest.'' 
 ''Instead,'' he said, ''Wesleyan's allegations are based in misunderstanding and exaggeration.''
 At issue is the wording of Mr. Kannam's contract and whether it gave him leeway to pursue outside ventures. The contract, according to the lawsuit, said that he ''shall not accept any positions on boards or other activities, compensatory or otherwise, that would take meaningful time away from his responsibilities.''
 Martin Stein, a lawyer who represents Belstar Group, an investment company named in the suit, said both Mr. Kannam and Belstar ''will testify that nothing he did for Belstar detracted'' from his work at Wesleyan.
 Wesleyan claims that the majority of Mr. Kannam's e-mail messages and a ''significant portion'' of his phone calls related to his outside ventures. Those ranged from various investment funds to a Massachusetts company, Advance Device Technology, founded by his father and in which Mr. Kannam was director of business development.
 While making $460,000 a year at Wesleyan, Mr. Kannam held the title of director of investment at Belstar Group, which has offices in Manhattan. While Wesleyan asserts that Mr. Kannam charged the university for weekly trips to New York for Belstar, Mr. Stein said that he visited Belstar ''only about once every three or four weeks'' and used his Belstar credit card.
 The lawsuit also details a number of other trips -- Disney World with his family, India for a wedding, England for a job interview -- that Mr. Kannam claimed were work related, citing nearby conferences, and for which he filed expenses.
 In India, for instance, Mr. Kannam, who was born in Southeast India, told Wesleyan that he was attending a conference in which the host was a man named Ratan Tata. ''Not only was no such conference held,'' the lawsuit said, ''but Ratan Tata is, in fact, an official adviser to Belstar Group.''
 In perhaps the most egregious example cited in the lawsuit under the heading ''fraudulent expenses,'' Wesleyan said that Mr. Kannam traveled to Britain with his wife and children in 2006 to interview for a position at Cambridge University. 
 ''Not only was the trip reimbursed by Cambridge University,'' the lawsuit states, ''but he fraudulently used his Wesleyan credit card for trip expenses, as well as submitted fraudulent and redundant cash expense reports to Wesleyan for the same trip expenses.''
 The university also accused Mr. Kannam of pressing for more staff and using them to do research for his own activities. ''Send me a list of things you'd like done with the hedge fund data so that I can get my guys working on it,'' Mr. Kannam wrote to a partner at Belstar Group.
 The lawsuit said that Mr. Kannam lobbied to move his offices to a secluded spot on campus so he could ''work on his personal 'entrepreneurial ventures' away from the view of others in North College,'' the main administration building. He relocated to newly renovated space, which he called the ''Taj,'' the suit said.
 Wesleyan highlighted several e-mail exchanges to show that Mr. Kannam concealed his activities and understood the conflict of interest. As the university was revising its conflict of interest policy, for example, the lawsuit says that Mr. Kannam's wife sent him an e-mail saying the new policy seemed ''tailor-made'' to apply to him. ''Oucheroo,'' she remarked.
 While the suit against Mr. Kannam is potentially embarrassing for Wesleyan, Ada Meloy, general counsel for the American Council on Education, praised the school for pursuing it anyway. ''Colleges and universities do not seek to have publicity that reveals unpleasantness,'' she said. ''But it is something that they are right in going forward with in order to reclaim assets. It takes real effort to tackle a problem like this.'' 
 But Mr. Stein, the lawyer for Belstar, said that he believes that Wesleyan was ''looking for a scapegoat'' for its recent endowment losses. ''There's no claim that because Kannam was spending so much time on Belstar and others, that he did not do his job properly and or that Wesleyan lost money because of that,'' he said. ''Wesleyan's silence on these things speaks very, very loudly. It's a real hatchet job.''

Regulators have shut down a small bank in Minnesota, bringing to 16 the number of bank failures in 2010 after the 140 brought down last year by rising loan defaults and the recession. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Friday took over the 1st American State Bank of Minnesota, in Hancock, Minn., with about $18.2 million in assets and $16.3 million in deposits. Community Development Bank, based in Ogema, Minn., agreed to assume the assets and deposits of the failed bank. The two branches of 1st American State Bank will reopen on Monday as branches of Community Development Bank.

HEADLINE: Fearing Less Business, Restaurateurs Assail Plan for Inspectors to Post Letter Grades

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
''Letter grades are nothing more than a scarlet letter that will keep people from eating out,'' Geoff Kravitz, a spokesman for the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce, said Friday at the first public hearing called to consider the city's proposal to rate restaurant cleanliness with letter grades.
 He was not the only one to invoke the stigma of an upper-case A. In point of fact, the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would assign a bright-blue letter ''A'' or a green B to New York restaurants that have passed inspection, instead of handing out a numerical grade as is done now. But still, many in the restaurant business objected as if the city had likened them to Hester Prynne at a public shaming. 
 Mr. Kravitz said that the restaurateurs of his borough are ''fully committed to opposing letter grading.'' He and the other opponents were enthusiastically applauded by a standing-room crowd of 70 that jammed a hearing room. 
 The audience overflowed into a third-floor hallway, and some of the would-be speakers left when they couldn't squeeze into the room. 
 The lone voice in favor of the proposal, Laurie Tansman, said she was a nutritionist at Mount Sinai Hospital ''speaking for myself,'' sharing her ''tremendous concern'' about food-borne illness, mentioning that one of her kidney-dialysis patients died from eating food that had been improperly stored. 
 ''I very much support the proposed amendment,'' she said, to little reaction. 
 The new rules would compel the city's 25,648 food-service establishments to prominently display inspectors' cleanliness ratings on 8-by-10-inch placards: a blue A for the highest rating (from zero to 13 points under the old system), a green B for a less-sanitary but still passing grade (from 13 to 27 points), and a yellow C for a failing grade. 
 The New York State Restaurant Association, the operators' trade group, successfully exhorted its members to turn out at the hearing in force with alerts titled ''We need YOU!'' 
 The association has lobbied the health department to exempt all nonfood-related violations (involving such issues as burned-out light bulbs, leaky faucets and improperly posted signs) from the letter-grade calculation. 
 At the hearing, Robert Bookman, legislative counsel for the New York City chapters of the restaurant association, argued that ''a mandated posting against the wishes of the owner raises significant free-speech issues.'' 
 And Mr. Bookman said that if the health department saw the new system as a recession revenue-enhancer, ''it might be surprised at how much revenue it loses if restaurants go out of business.''
 But Elliott S. Marcus, an associate health commissioner hearing the testimony, previously said that if the department wanted to raise revenues, ''then we would raise the fines.'' 
 The fines have remained from $200 and $2,000, depending on the severity of an infraction.
 The restaurant association has held that letter ratings would encourage bribery and corruption -- since the highly public placards would dramatically raise cleanliness ratings' significance to restaurateurs. 
 Michael O'Neal, a proprietor of O'Neal's restaurant on West 64th Street near Lincoln Center, noted that he started in the business when John V. Lindsay was the mayor, ''and I remember when payoffs were so commonplace that the F.B.I. had to come in and arrest the inspectors.'' 
 But Mr. Marcus said in an interview that the department had enacted many ''corruption-control measures and will continue to actively use them as we have in the past.'' 
 A year ago, the department revealed its intention to abandon the current numerical grading system, in which anything above 28 is a failing mark and adopt the letter grades.
 Restaurants that receive a B or C must be reinspected within a month, giving them a chance to improve. In Los Angeles, the letter system has been in effect for more than a decade. According to a 2007 study by the county's Health Department, 91 percent of the populace likes the letter-grading plan. 
 But one speaker, Robin Wertheimer, said that restaurateurs in New York ''are not Los Angeles,'' adding that ''most of their buildings are not 200 years old, and most of them are not next to empty lots with hundreds of rats. It would be nice if the city would clean up those lots.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Takes a Dive and Then Resurfaces

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; Matthew Saltmarsh and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Wall Street indexes swung wildly on Friday but ended the day higher as investors tried to look beyond fears that Europe's debt crisis would choke off global growth. 
 After a seesaw week in which stocks retreated to November levels, investors found hope in signs that unemployment was easing in the United States. Traders used the recent downturn in the market as an opportunity to snap up shares cheaply, fueling a late rally that in the final minutes pushed stocks into positive territory.
 It was an unexpectedly cheery end to a tumultuous week for Wall Street. The trouble began on Thursday, when worries about large deficits in Greece, Portugal and Spain ricocheted across global markets, spurring talk that economic recovery could falter. 
 On Friday, the anxiety re-emerged -- first in Asia, where Hong Kong's index fell more than 3 percent. European markets followed suit, with indexes in Paris, Frankfurt and London tumbling more than 1.5 percent apiece.
 Stocks on Wall Street were initially caught in the downward momentum, sinking nearly 2 percent in the afternoon. But by the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average had eked out a gain -- 10.05 points, or 0.1 percent -- ending at 10,012.23. The wider Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 3.08 points higher, or 0.29 percent, at 1,066.19. The technology-dominated Nasdaq was the day's best performer, rising 15.69 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,141.12.
 The focus on Friday was on countries like Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, which have struggled to rein in swelling deficits after spending billions on stimulus programs and after years of poor fiscal management.
 ''The fear is, 'What happens if the recovery in Europe rolls over into a double-dip recession,' '' said Hank B. Smith, chief investment officer for Haverford Investments. ''It creates uncertainty as we wait to see how this relatively young experiment, the European Union, deals with this crisis.''
 Some of the anxiety was offset by the Labor Department's monthly snapshot of the jobs market. In January, the unemployment rate declined to 9.7 percent, from 10 percent in December, the government said, and job losses totaled 20,000. The data were mixed, but investors were content with even faint indications of progress. Analysts had expected the jobless rate to remain at 10 percent, and they predicted the economy had added 15,000 jobs in January. 
 ''We are starting to get some stabilization in the jobless picture,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, a market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus. ''But we still need to get this back on a growth trajectory.''
 A report showing that consumer borrowing in the United States had fallen less than expected in December also buoyed hopes on Wall Street. Still, borrowing fell for the 11th consecutive month, dropping $1.7 billion, suggesting spending would remain tepid.
 Even before Europe's debt woes surfaced on Thursday, the United States stock market had shown signs of foundering. A steep sell-off in late January, prompted by concerns over a clampdown on banks and a slowdown in Chinese lending, stirred talk of a decline of 10 percent or more. Since Jan. 19, the Dow has fallen nearly 7 percent.
 The focus in the near term remains on Europe, as investors try to evaluate the severity of the budget problems and the effect on financial institutions. Unable to embark on the kind of fiscal and monetary stimulus seen in the United States and Britain, Greece appears to have few options other than a bailout by more stable European countries. 
 Economists said the fiscal and budgetary demands of euro-zone membership were limiting the options for Greece and other euro-using countries. Countries that use the euro cannot devalue their currencies to regain competitiveness, or cut interest rates. 
 That has led investors to sell the bonds of those countries in recent weeks. Yields on the benchmark 10-year bonds of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain moved higher Friday, while those of Germany and France eased, suggesting funds were still flowing from the peripheral members of the euro zone into the core countries. 
 Interest rates in the United States were slightly lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 11/32, to 98 14/32, and the yield fell to 3.57 percent from 3.61 percent late Thursday.
 Amid the jitters, the euro sagged against the dollar, moving to $1.3634, its lowest level since May. That trend will probably be quietly welcomed by European politicians like President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who have been calling for a weaker currency to help exports.
 ''All the problems that the boom had hidden are coming to the fore,'' said George Magnus, senior economic adviser at UBS in London. 
 Mr. Battipaglia said the instability in Europe had caused investors to worry that the bill for global stimulus spending had gotten too large.
 ''Other nations -- the U.K. and United States included -- will be called into question,'' Mr. Battipaglia said. ''The concern is whether they have too much debt and if they can sustain the level of spending to stimulate the economy.''

HEADLINE: Seeking a Safer Way To Securitization

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Can the world be made safe for the return of securitizations?
 That is a question of great importance to those like John C. Dugan, the comptroller of the currency, who say they believe that the banking system on its own is unlikely to have the ability to provide enough credit to sustain an economic recovery in the United States.
 ''We need a vibrant, credible securitization market to help fund the real economy going forward,'' Mr. Dugan said this week. He was preaching to the choir -- a meeting of the American Securitization Forum -- but it is an opinion widely held in financial markets.
 It is possible to question that thesis. Securitization grew as a way for banks to get around capital rules, not because of any profound desire by investors for such assets or any real unwillingness by banks to make the loans. But since it was more expensive to hold capital against the risk if the loans were not securitized, they were securitized. That also opened the market to new players, who neither wanted to, nor could amass, the capital to hold onto loans. 
 Together, those developments undoubtedly made mortgage loans less expensive for borrowers. That was welcome to politicians and to regulators, who wrongly thought that securitization had moved a lot of risk outside the banking system. 
 Then the whole structure collapsed. 
 If they have no way to gain capital advantages from securitization, banks might choose to make more loans anyway, and the economy could get by without securitization.
 But there is no doubt that the banks have not fallen all over themselves to lend as it is, even with many billions of dollars in government-supplied capital. Something like 95 percent of the American mortgage market now depends on government guarantees, through Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or the Federal Housing Administration.
 At some point, that share has to decline drastically as the government steps back. And it is reasonable to think a securitization market could be part of the answer.
 But how to do it? The old private securitization failed for a variety of reasons. Loan underwriting standards vanished in part because the people making the loans concluded they would profit from fees for arranging the loans, whether or not they were ever repaid. Regulators stood aside, thinking they had no power over many players. 
 Investors in the securitizations did not do their homework, either assuming that rising housing prices made such work unnecessary or that the quality of the loans was being policed by bond rating agencies, which were doing no such thing.
 There are several essential elements to any fix. The underlying loans have to be of better quality. The investors have to believe that is the case and that they are being compensated for risks that were much higher than they previously believed. Another 30 percent collapse in home prices is unlikely, but it will be a while before anyone's models deem such a thing impossible. 
 There are two ways being suggested to deal with the quality issue. Mr. Dugan favors using government edicts to set lending standards. Other officials want to find ways to use the market system to promote better lending.
 The principle market-based approach now being pushed is called ''skin in the game.'' Force a banker to hold onto some part of the loan -- and details of just how much, or in what form, are subject to debate -- and he will act better.
 In an interview, Mr. Dugan said he was not necessarily opposed to such rules, but he had a lot of doubt about them. First, there are accounting issues. The accounting rules are not clear, and even if they were, banking regulators like Mr. Dugan could allow the banks to deviate from them in computing capital. But the reformed rules do make it harder for banks to get loans off their balance sheets if they retain any stake in them. And capital must be held against assets that are kept on the balance sheets.
 In his speech, Mr. Dugan said he thought off-balance sheet treatment was vital to getting the securitization market moving again, and that meant a ''skin in the game'' rule could be perverse.
 ''A requirement intended to improve the securitization market by improving the quality and trustworthiness of underwriting could significantly curtail the number of securitizations that are actually done,'' he said. ''And that, of course, could materially reduce the amount of credit available for housing or any of the other sectors that have traditionally benefited from securitizations.''
 There was, he said, a simple question to be asked: ''Instead of going at the underwriting problem indirectly through 'skin in the game' requirements, why not attack it directly?'' Why not enact regulations to force lenders to lend responsibly?
 He talked of requiring lenders to actually check income of borrowers, and to set minimum down payment rules. But he was vague on how low the down payments should be. The F.H.A. still requires only 3 percent, which may be too low, but raising it would be politically explosive.
 Moreover, it is hard to envision rules that cannot be evaded by someone who wishes to do so. Bank examiners cannot check every loan. 
 There is also the real possibility of political interference. It is not hard to imagine a bank telling someone he could not get a mortgage because of a stupid government rule, and that person complaining to his congressman. It might really be absurd to deny that person a loan, but changing the rule could weaken it for others who might be less worthy borrowers.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is considering imposing some kind of ''skin in the game'' rule for securitizations, forcing a lending bank to hold on to part of the risk of default. 
 ''We must have better loans,'' Michael H. Krimminger, the deputy for policy to the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, Sheila C. Bair, said in an interview. ''One way is to have regulatory fiat. That is important, but it is not sufficient.''
 If the private securitization market is to be revived, would-be investors will have to be persuaded there are better safeguards. Such persuasion seems likely to include more disclosures, more time for investors to review loans before securitizations are completed and perhaps some rules to assure that mortgages are not securitized until the borrower has met several monthly payments.
 Even then, it might be difficult to persuade investors to trust in loans made by lenders who are unloading all the risks on investors.
 Mortgages are highly dependent on individual facts that are not easy for an investor to review. Is the borrower really responsible? Is the house really worth this much? It was mortgage lenders who bribed assessors to overstate the value of homes so the mortgages would go through. At a minimum, any new securitization system should take away that incentive from the lender.
 The beauty of Adam Smith's ''invisible hand'' is that it leads players to maximize the welfare of all by seeking to maximize their own welfare. But that hand is diverted in perverse ways if the player thinks it can profit from making a bad loan. A reformed securitization market may need to rely in part on bringing back that invisible hand.

HEADLINE: Under Siege in Europe

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Fortress Europe is now under attack by the market. 
 For months, the conventional wisdom in Europe was that the speculative aims of bond traders and hedge fund investors would remain largely focused on Greece, Europe's chronic problem child. 
 But this week the cost of insuring the debt of not just Greece, but Portugal and Spain as well, rose to record levels -- causing stock markets to tumble, the euro to fall, and borrowing costs in the most vulnerable countries to soar. 
 As a result, governments in the 16 countries that use the euro must now confront a new and disturbing reality: The deal they struck more than a decade ago to create a common currency area, hoping that a single central bank could manage to paper over the divergent economic and financial conditions of its members, is finally being challenged. 
 ''This is the first big test for the European monetary system,'' said Christopher Wood, an investment strategist for Credit Lyonnais securities in Asia. ''And it is clear this year that global macro risk will come from Euroland and not the U.S.'' 
 On Friday the cost of insuring Greek, Spanish and Portuguese debt eased from their record highs -- perhaps on comments made by Dominique Strauss Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, that the fund was ready and willing to help Greece if asked to do so. 
 But the billions of dollars being traded in the market for credit default swaps on government bonds suggested that investors were not retreating from their expectation that the gap between Europe's laggard periphery and its recovering core -- Germany, France and the smaller countries of northern Europe -- would keep widening. 
 As this is an effective bet that peripheral governments will not have the stomach to push through tough reforms, bond investors are spending as much time analyzing the power of Spanish and Greek unions as they do the spreads on credit default swaps. 
 In Deutsche Bank's weekly fixed income report, for example, analysts highlighted a Greek public sector strike on Feb. 10 and another one on Feb. 24 while also drawing attention to the possibility that Spanish unions might strike later this month to protest the increased retirement age.
 The Greek government's ability to make a good impression on its coming road show to America and Asia next month will also be a key benchmark. 
 While Greece's finance minister has said that yields of almost 7 percent are high enough to give investors a good return for the risk involved, the fact that the Greek government must raise almost half of its funding requirement of 53 billion euros this spring in an increasingly skeptical market gives investors concern.
 Investors will be also wary of any more incomplete bond auctions like the one that hit Portugal on Wednesday when the government pared back the amount of bonds it was going to sell due to a sharp spike in the bond yield. 
 Adding to the unease in Portugal is a showdown next week in parliament that could force the government in Lisbon to admit that it will not be able to keep its promise to hold the budget deficit this year to 8 percent of G.D.P.
 And another gloomy economic report from Madrid on Friday showed economic activity was down a sharp 3 percent for the final quarter of 2009 from the year before, meaning that Spain remained one of the few major countries still in the grip of recession. 
 The speculator's bet is a simple one. 
 In an era in which government budget deficits have soared in response to the financial crisis, the same bond vigilantes that forced President Clinton to balance the American budget in the 1990s have turned their attention to the countries on Europe's southern flank. 
 In effect, they have challenged those relatively weak governments to raise taxes and impose harsh spending cuts on a restive populace to bring down their deficits from over 10 percent of G.D.P. to the benchmark levels close to 3 percent of G.D.P. called for in the European treaty that created the euro. 
 While such moves are highly unpopular politically, a failure to do so could send government borrowing costs soaring, enriching those who are betting that Greece, Portugal, Spain and perhaps even Italy will not be able to follow through on their commitments. 
 Joseph Stiglitz, the international economist who is an adviser to the Greek government, sees the investor demands as lacking in merit. Indeed, he points to the inherent contradiction in allowing the richer countries in Europe to borrow heavily to pull themselves out of recession while the poorer countries are forced to take a knife to the very programs intended to soften the blow of an economic downturn. 
 ''If you tighten the way the markets seem to want you will get a political response that is non-viable,'' he said, drawing a comparison to Iceland, where popular discontent forced the country's president to abrogate a controversial agreement to repay foreign creditors. ''These are democracies -- not dictatorships.'' 
 Mr. Stiglitz proposes that Europe's richer countries like Germany and France take the lead in aiding Greece -- for the sake of the European whole, however shaken it might be. 
 But that may be easier said than done. 
 The charter establishing the euro, while supposedly ruling out any bailouts by the European Central Bank or member governments, also failed to establish any mechanism for providing funds to countries in financial trouble. That is the kind of role normally taken on by the International Monetary Fund, but Europeans are determined to keep the I.M.F. away from nations within the eurozone because of the questions it might raise about the viability of the common currency. 
 European Union nations outside the eurozone, like Romania, Latvia and Hungary, have received support from the I.M.F., which then imposed various fiscal requirements intended to insure they can pay back the loans. 
 But for those countries using the euro the stability pact that was charged with monitoring member country finances was thought to be sufficient to keep countries in line. Greece's consistent and premeditated pattern of skirting the fiscal standards set by the European Commission has dashed those beliefs. 
 Miranda Xafa, a former executive board member of the I.M.F., believes that the time has come for Europe to acknowledge that it has neither the technical expertise to monitor government behavior nor the ability to quickly raise rescue funds. Only the I.M.F., she argues, is capable of truly doing that job. 
 ''Greece's economic fundamental are by far the worst in the eurozone,'' she said. ''The I.M.F. coming in would also help the other countries and restore confidence.'' 
 But in Brussels, turning to the I.M.F. is seen as conceding that the monetary union cannot care for its own. 
 Whether Europe can hold out much longer, though, remains in doubt. Jonathan Tepper, a partner at Variant Perception, a research firm that caters to hedge funds, argues that the rising borrowing costs for countries like Greece and Portugal are a sign that the economic problems in Europe's south are deep and will not disappear without a long and painful readjustment. 
 ''People are just dumping debt,'' he said. ''It is pure risk aversion that is pushing spreads higher.'' 
 For Greek, Spanish and Portugal governments that still need to raise billions from these very markets over the next few months, that is bad news indeed.
 This is the more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Women Now A Majority In American Workplaces

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
For the first time in recorded history, women outnumber men on the nation's payrolls. 
 This benchmark is bittersweet, as it comes largely at men's expense. Because men have been losing their jobs faster than women, the downturn has at times been referred to as a ''man-cession.'' 
 Women's new majority in the nation's workplaces comes decades after women first began trading in their aprons for pantsuits in droves, and it reinforces expectations that women will continue on the path to pay parity.
 ''Important milestones remain to be achieved, but women's surpassing 50 percent of employment is something that historians will note for years to come,'' said Casey B. Mulligan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago who has been tracking the recession's effects on both sexes. 
 According to seasonally unadjusted data released on Friday by the Labor Department, women held the majority of nonfarm payroll jobs in January. They also did so during February, March, November and December of last year, but the shift emerged only on Friday when the Labor Department revised its 2009 data. Women's slender lead was highest last month, when they held 50.3 percent of the nation's nonfarm payroll jobs in the raw numbers. 
 Over the last few decades, women have been steadily claiming a greater share of the nation's payrolls. In 1964, the first year for which the government began collecting this data, less than a third of the nation's nonfarm payroll jobs were held by women.
 But it was the recession that finally pushed women into the majority.
 As in previous recessions, male workers have borne the brunt of the job losses in the last two years. Since the recession began in December 2007, men have lost 7.4 million jobs on net, whereas women have lost 3.9 million jobs. 
 In other words, both sexes are worse off than they were before the downturn, but men have suffered more. 
 The types of jobs held by men and women help explain the shift. Men are more likely to work in industries like manufacturing, which rise and fall with the economic cycle. Women are more likely to work in government, health care and education, among the safest categories in a downturn. Health care employment has been among the strongest of any type during the recession. 
 It is also ''no accident'' that women pushed ahead of men during colder months, says Professor Mulligan. 
 Male-dominated industries are actually especially cyclical in two different ways: They are not only influenced by the business cycle, but also by the seasonal cycle. Industries like construction, which tend to employ men, get more work in warmer months.
 If you adjust for these regular seasonal factors that affect the job market, women would have held just less than half of the nation's payroll jobs in January, at 49.9 percent.
 All of this means that women are likely to fall back to a minority of the nation's payrolls again once the weather warms and the recovery gains a foothold in the labor markets. Still, the longer-term trend of stronger representation on the nation's payrolls will most likely continue, economists say.

HEADLINE: After Unemployment Ends, Pain and Trauma May Linger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C. 

 BODY:
Antje Newby went back to work in September, but she has still not escaped the burden imposed by nine months of unemployment.
 Mrs. Newby and her husband were forced to walk away from their home in suburban Detroit and are now living here in a rented house with their three children. They are bracing for a huge tax bill in the spring because of early withdrawals they made on her 401(k) and taxes they still owe on unemployment benefits. Their credit is in tatters, and their 16-year marriage showed cracks they are still trying to repair. 
 ''We're not done living through the fallout of all of that,'' Mrs. Newby said, four months into her new job as an account director of an advertising agency here. 
 The wound of unemployment, as her family has learned, is not cauterized so quickly, and lives do not simply go back to the way they were.
 Interviews with more than a dozen people who were out of work at least a half-year during the recession and have now landed jobs found many adjusting to new realities. Some of the changes are self-imposed; others forced upon them. They include grappling with newfound insecurities and scaled-back budgets; reshaped priorities and broken relationships. In some ways, it is equivalent to the lingering symptoms of post-traumatic stress.
 In returning to work, Mrs. Newby, 41, has fulfilled a dream of millions of jobless people as the economy lurches back to life. But with the average duration of unemployment now more than six months, the consequences of the period will continue to ripple through the lives of many.
 Matt Grogan, 40, who lost his job in Michigan in 2007 and was out of work for close to two years before landing a position in information technology in West Virginia seven months ago, said he was petrified heading into his first performance review.
 ''I could not sleep that night,'' Mr. Grogan said. ''I called my mom. I had so much anxiety. I was worried about going to that meeting and having them say, 'You're done.' ''
 Lee Black, 43, who lost his job in information technology twice for a total of eight months in the recession, forcing him to declare bankruptcy, has now taken over from his wife the handling of his family's finances, and is hewing for the first time to a strict budget. Their family of five goes to church now every Sunday. And he has quit drinking. 
 Still, even though Mr. Black has been back to work for more than six months, he continues to feel as if he is living on a knife's edge. The job he found is in Cincinnati, a two-hour drive from his home in Columbus. He stays in a camper he keeps in a parking lot near his work during the week and pours himself unrelentingly into his job, volunteering for extra shifts, including overnight on Christmas.
 ''If the rug is pulled out again, I'm not going to survive,'' he said. 
 In the case of the Newbys, the strife between Mrs. Newby and her husband, Tom, 42, whose work in commercial flooring dried up last year as well, has cooled after flaring in the crucible of unemployment, but the embers remain. 
 The fate of their house in Michigan, on which they have not made payments in months, is still looming, and with it, the full impact on their credit. With no savings and little chance of securing a loan, they worry about how they will be able to get a new car in June when the lease on their old one expires.
 ''We've got financial impact we're going to deal with forever,'' said Mrs. Newby, who is still behind on her bills.
 And small and large changes now abound in their lives. The family packed up and moved south in a matter of weeks after Mrs. Newby was hired. Their older daughter, Allison, 16, once an avid basketball player, is no longer playing in her new school. The couple has resolved to rent and never own again after feeling trapped by their old house.
 ''This has totally changed my perspective,'' Mrs. Newby said. 
 It is not clear whether those who have gone back to work will embrace a new frugality. The Newbys are doing their best to rein in their spending, both out of necessity and to make sure they are better protected for the future. Like many other Americans, they had always simply spent what they earned.
 But they have failed to set aside anything so far, even with Mrs. Newby's six-figure salary. Their race to catch up on bills is only part of the explanation. They are still without a second income, because the couple agreed that Mr. Newby would stay home initially to help the children, including Tommy, 4, and Mackenzie, 7, through the transition. The cost of day care also means it makes little sense for him to take just any job. 
 They have tried to exercise discipline, but the reality is they have struggled at times to shed old habits. They had initially set a budget of $1,300 a month for their rental home, the same as their mortgage back in Michigan, but they wound up inching up to $1,600, because they fell in love with the house they are living in now.
 Mr. Newby has intentionally been less strict with the children to help them through the tumult. He has been especially conscious about giving Allison, a high school junior who still breaks down in tears at times over their move, a wide berth.
 For her part, Allison says she is studying harder than ever because she believes she now needs to get a scholarship to go to college. Her career goals have shifted as well. She is focused on finding a job in a stable field to avoid what happened to her parents. 
 She has observed her parents' relationship warm up, but it is not clear if they are all the way back. The other day, the couple found themselves arguing once again about the Michigan house. Mrs. Newby wanted to go to the bank and finally settle the matter, but her husband argued it was fine to wait.
 ''It was the old tapes playing again,'' Mrs. Newby said.
 Even with the long shadow of her job loss, Mrs. Newby's attitude toward work has shifted, driven in part by her Christian faith. In an all-consuming advertising career, she is now less inclined to throw herself completely into it.
 ''I gave so much of my life, so much of my energy and time to serving this company and clients and for what?'' she said. ''Where did it get me?''

HEADLINE: Learning What Food Looks Like Before It Goes Into the Package

BYLINE: By HANNAH WALLACE

 BODY:
About 20 high school students stood behind the butcher counter, staring at a 160-pound piece of meat from a recently slaughtered cow.
 ''All of our meat comes from local farms, and we get it all whole,'' said Tom Mylan, 33, one of three butchers at the Meat Hook, a new butcher shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that buys its meat locally and prizes nose-to-tail eating. ''We don't just buy steaks or pork chops or whatever.'' 
 ''How much does the whole cow cost?'' one boy in a white hoodie had asked moments before. Answer: about $3.25 a pound. ''Do you slaughter here?'' asked another. Short answer: no--most slaughterhouses are upstate. ''What is chorizo?'' asked a girl. Answer: a spicy Spanish sausage. 
 These curious students, all juniors and seniors at Automotive High School in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, are taking a class called ''Food, Land, and You.'' Introduced by Jenny Kessler, a teacher at the school, three years ago, this elective English course is a primer about food broadly defined -- its social, political and economic aspects. While dozens of New York City public schools have edible gardens, or offer student-grown food on the cafeteria menu, Ms. Kessler's class is unusual in the wider perspective it takes. 
 ''Food justice is a huge issue,'' Ms. Kessler, 31, said. ''But we study and talk blatantly about it -- who has access to this food and why.'' 
 Ms. Kessler's pupils study factory farming and corn subsidies, read articles by Michael Pollan and Wendell Berry and watch documentaries like ''Food, Inc.,'' a dark look at the nation's industrialized food system. They also tend a 2,500-square-foot organic vegetable garden that borders their school, financing it with funds they raise and with support from the New York chapter of Slow Food U.S.A. In season, their plot teems with cucumbers, eggplant, okra, peas, red cabbage, spinach, tomatoes and many herbs. The teenagers can take the food home free, and they sell the rest at an after-school farm stand. 
 But the popularity of Ms. Kessler's class -- it is one of the most sought-after at the school, according to Mary Brouder, the principal -- may be due to the frequent trips, like the one to the Meat Hook. 
 In the fall, for example, Ms. Kessler took her charges to the Queens County Farm Museum, where they collected eggs, worked with compost and helped clear garden beds. She also secured a stand for her students at the Union Square Greenmarket, where they ran cooking demonstrations, and she organized a volunteer stint for them at the Bowery Mission, where they made lunch for the homeless. 
 Twice a year, Ms. Kessler also takes her students to Hawthorne Valley Farm in Ghent, N.Y., where they make apple cider and apple pies from scratch, feed the pigs and sweep up cow manure. For many of these students, who hail from gritty neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and East New York, that excursion marks their first visit to a farm. 
 Back at the Meat Hook, another butcher, Brent Young, 27, was displaying the tools of his trade. 
 ''Ninety percent of our work is done with our knives, most importantly this five-inch European-style breaking knife,'' Mr. Young said, pulling the tool out of his scabbard for all to see. He then pointed out the band saw (used for cutting through thick bones), the three-horsepower meat grinder (for sausages and ground beef) and a hand saw (for cutting through muscle and bone). When a student asked if there were ever any accidents, Mr. Mylan produced a chain-mail vest, which he said the butchers use ''when we're doing really serious work.'' 
 ''Sometimes,'' he added, ''the dense bone and hard muscle is not exactly where you thought it was and that knife will just come through and you can really hurt yourself.'' 
 When it came time to sampling some raw meat -- something these butchers do every day to ensure the meat is of high quality -- the students hesitated. 
 ''If it's nasty, I'm not going to try it again,'' said Denzel Conze, 18. 
 Ben Turley, 29, another of the Meat Hook butchers, cut a raw flatiron steak into thin slices, sprinkling each with some salt. 
 ''It tastes like salty gummy bears,'' Jamie Colon, 16, said after a bite of the meat. 
 Most of Ms. Kessler's students live in ''food deserts''--neighborhoods with lots of fast food but little fresh produce or other healthy fare. Automotive High School's students are predominantly low income, too, with 75 percent of them qualifying for a free lunch, according to Ms. Brouder. 
 Though the students may not return to the Meat Hook to buy the homemade sausages ($10.99 a pound), or even the grass-fed beef ($6 a pound), that's not really the point. ''The purpose of going there is just for them to know it's out there,'' Ms. Kessler said. ''It's really hard to cement in their heads that there are other options to industrial food.''

HEADLINE: A Recovery That's Factory-Built and Gaining Speed

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
A GLOBAL recovery in manufacturing appears to be accelerating. Most manufacturers around the world are reporting an increase in output and new orders, both of which plunged in late 2008 and early 2009 as a credit crisis spurred fears of a new Depression.
 The sharpness of the rebound, reflected in the indexes created by the Institute for Supply Management in the United States, and recreated in many other countries by Markit, could indicate that the American economy is not in line for another slow recovery, as happened after the two most recent downturns, in the early 1990s and the early 2000s. 
 That strength was also reflected in the gross national product estimate for the final quarter of 2009, with an annual rate of growth of 5.7 percent, the fastest for any quarter in more than six years. And on Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate fell to 9.7 percent in January. It added that while the entire economy lost 20,000 jobs, there was an increase of 11,000 jobs in manufacturing employment -- the first such gain in three years.
 ''Surprisingly, given the predominant sentiment the United States is in a subpar recovery, the current recovery in real G.D.P. has been right in line with the strong recoveries which took place in the past,'' said Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management, an investment arm of Wells Fargo, pointing to the recoveries in the early 1980s and the mid-1970s.
 Employment growth so far is more spotty, reflecting both the competitiveness of the local economy and the number of jobs lost in the downturn. Europe and Japan, economies that were slower to fire workers during the recession, seem to have less need to add workers now.
 The accompanying charts reflect the monthly surveys of manufacturers in 10 countries around the world, focusing on output and employment. The survey results are usually reported on a scale of zero to 100, with numbers above 50 indicating that more companies are reporting growth than decline. For this article, they were recalibrated to show the numbers over or under 50.
 All countries saw very sharp declines in 2008 and early 2009, but the recoveries since have been nearly as rapid, leading some analysts to hope for a V-shaped recovery for the American economy.
 That view, however, remains a distinctly minority one. In large part, that is because most people remember the two slow recoveries, and because the unemployment rate remains high. But it also may reflect the political leanings of commentators. Many on the left want a new stimulus package, and view talk of a good recovery as a threat to that, particularly given the rising concern over the government's budget deficit. Many on the right are instinctively critical of the Obama administration and its economic programs.
 To some extent, the recoveries around the world may be less due to any government programs than they are to the fact companies overreacted, slashing everything they could -- including employment, orders and inventories -- when the outlook appeared darkest. Just getting back to the actual low levels of demand in the recession may require some additional production. 
 Of the 10 countries shown in the accompanying chart, all but one show more manufacturers reporting growing output than reporting declines, with the most widespread increases shown in the United States. The exception is Spain, a country facing severe fiscal woes and difficulties in regaining competitiveness with other European economies.
 Despite widespread worry over unemployment in the United States, the surveys show employment growth at a greater proportion of American manufacturers than in most countries.

HEADLINE: Seeking Ways to Remake the Banking System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''How to Reform Our Financial System,'' by Paul Volcker (Op-Ed, Jan. 31):
 Mr. Volcker's resolute call to reach down into the mire of our financial fiasco and make the necessary structural changes through laws is exactly right. It is one thing to get us on the road to economic recovery, but taxpayers demand that needed changes be made to ensure that we do not go down the same troubled roads in the future. 
 After the banks were bailed out, they made record profits in 2009, only to reduce consumer and small-business lending -- while at the same time giving out billions of dollars in bonuses.
 I hope these trends are changing, but at this moment, one thing bank officials can do is to embrace the Obama regulatory reforms. That would add confidence in the future of our banking system and in our economy, something urgently needed.
 Bart Chilton Commissioner, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Washington, Feb. 1, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Paul Volcker's recommendations for reforming our financial system to prevent similar catastrophic events in the future are compelling. His considerable experience and authority add weight to these ideas, and we are fortunate to have his advice.
 I hope the administration will incorporate Mr. Volcker's approach so that ''too big to fail'' will be replaced by ''too small to bail.''
 Edward A. Moran Hellertown, Pa., Jan. 31, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Paul Volcker's article includes little that is about actual reforms. He calls for an agency to ''assume control'' and arrange ''an orderly liquidation or merger.'' But how does that alter the existing regulatory structure?
 An arrangement involving several regulators guided the orderly liquidation of Drexel Burnham Lambert after the holding company filed for bankruptcy in 1990.
 The remaining employees worked for the court -- it paid our salaries (no bonuses). While we engaged aggressive creditors, we were never the final arbiters. 
 Yes, it took years to complete the process, but it worked. Even subordinated lenders who hung on were repaid. (Most bailed at discounted prices.)
 The stakes at A.I.G. were much higher, but the regulators could have fashioned a different outcome. There's no inherent reason Mr. Volcker's ''resolution authority'' would have an easier job than the Federal Reserve.
 Peter Schild Charlotte, N.C., Feb. 1, 2010
 The writer was treasurer of Drexel Burnham Lambert and chief audit executive of Wachovia.
 To the Editor:
 There is a simple way to fix the banking system. Banks should ask depositors what fraction of their deposits may be invested in speculative activities, and abide by their choices. 
 This would end the irresistible, immoral temptation to gamble with other people's money, and eliminate the rationale for bailouts.

HEADLINE: Public Housing Project to Come Tumbling Down

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Philadelphia tore down 21. Chicago leveled 79. Baltimore took down 21 as well, and when 6 of them came down in one day in 1995, it threw a parade.
 Since the 1990s, public housing high-rise buildings have come tumbling down by the dozens across the country as cities replace them with smaller suburban-style homes that do not carry the stigma of looming urban despair and poverty. 
 New York City has long been the great exception, and red-brick towers still dominate the skyline from the Lower East Side to East Harlem, from Mott Haven, in the Bronx, to Bushwick, Brooklyn. But now, for the first time in its 75-year history, the New York City Housing Authority wants to knock down an entire high-rise complex, Prospect Plaza in Brooklyn -- a move that has surprised and angered a number of former tenants and advocates for low-income housing. 
 In the past decade, the authority has chosen to renovate rather than tear down its aging housing stock, often at great expense. Its decision to demolish Prospect Plaza was not the result of a sweeping policy shift, but of the failure of a renovation project that became bogged down in years of administrative, financial and legal problems. 
 Prospect Plaza -- three 12- to 15-story towers in Brownsville -- is plagued by neither despair nor poverty: It has been vacant since 2003, when the last tenants were moved out with the promise they could return to refurbished apartments. 
 One recent evening, the sole occupant of Prospect Plaza -- many of the windows on the upper floors have been removed, giving the buildings a hollowed-out look -- was a security guard in a ground-floor office. The window frames and doorways on each tower's bottom three floors were sealed shut with cinderblocks or metal gates. The flagpole was flagless, but an old wooden sign remained: ''Welcome to Prospect Plaza.'' 
 Agency officials say they want to tear down the 35-year-old buildings and erect new apartments in their place. Officials initially planned to leave the towers standing and reconfigure the apartments, by eliminating some units to create bigger living rooms and bathrooms, but those plans were scrapped by the authority's new leadership because demolition made better financial sense.
 Ilene Popkin, the agency's assistant deputy general manager for development, said it would cost $481,000 to renovate each of the 269 apartments. Demolishing the structures and building 361 new units would cost $381,700 per unit. Ms. Popkin and other officials said the three buildings had deteriorated from vandalism and exposure to the elements, and were out of context with the neighborhood. The new apartments -- including public and private housing, not only for the poor but also for low- and moderate-income families -- are likely to be built in low-rise buildings.
 Prospect Plaza originally included four towers housing 1,200 people. One was torn down in 2005; the plan was to use that space for a new community center, shops and additional housing. But today, the building's old footprint is just a fenced-off lot. 
 That building was the first high-rise the authority demolished. In 2007, the agency also knocked down a number of two-story buildings as part of the redevelopment of the Markham Gardens complex on Staten Island. 
 The authority has completed the first two phases of its Prospect Plaza redevelopment plan, involving not the actual housing project itself but 37 two-family houses and 150 rental units in four-story town-house-style buildings that were constructed on nearby lots formerly owned by the city.
 Several former residents of Prospect Plaza and groups that represent public housing tenants said they did not support the demolition, in part, because it was unclear to them that the authority intended to replace the old units with the same number of new public housing units. Agency officials have not decided how many of the new apartments will be public housing, but they said that former residents and community leaders would help make that determination.
 ''We are committed to being shoulder to shoulder with you,'' the agency's new general manager, Michael Kelly, told former tenants and others at a community meeting last week a few blocks from the vacant buildings. 
 The cost of demolishing the towers and building the new apartments is estimated at $138 million. Part of the financing will come from a $21.4 million federal grant the authority was awarded in 1999 to revitalize Prospect Plaza, of which about $17 million remains. At the meeting, Mr. Kelly said it was too early to say where the rest of the financing would come from. Agency documents describe the project as ''mixed finance,'' meaning it will be paid for with public and private dollars, with some of the money coming from the sale of federal low-income housing tax credits.
 Michaels Development Company, a real estate company based in New Jersey, was hired in 2003 to rehabilitate the three towers, but the agency terminated its agreement with Michaels in 2007. In a letter to Representative Yvette D. Clarke's office in December, the agency said that Michaels ''was unable to develop a financially feasible plan for rehabilitation.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Michaels disputed that description. ''We had a viable plan to fully finance the deal,'' said the spokeswoman, Laura Ochipinti Zaner. 
 Michaels sued the agency in April 2008 for breach of contract, accusing it of mismanaging the project and of failing to compensate the company for $5.6 million in predevelopment and other costs. The project stalled in part because it took the agency three years to finish the development agreement and because of turnover at the authority, according to the lawsuit.
 In court documents, the agency denied many of the company's assertions, stating that Michaels breached the agreement by failing to obtain commitments from lenders willing to invest in the project. An agency spokeswoman said Michaels was paid about $4 million from the federal grant for architectural, engineering and environmental review work. 
 Even as the three towers sit vacant on Prospect Place near Saratoga Avenue, they continue to be a costly expense for the cash-strapped authority, which has paid a security firm $25,000 a month since 2005 to keep watch over the buildings. The demolition, which must be approved by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, is planned for this fall, with construction scheduled to start in 2012. 
 Preference for the new public housing units will go to former residents, many of whom were relocated to other public housing in Brooklyn. 
 At the community meeting, Priscilla Davis, 40, a former tenant, said she would not believe anything the authority told her until she was handed the keys to her new apartment. Milton Bolton, 50, a former resident and the president of the still-intact Prospect Plaza Tenants Association, held up a thick draft of a 1998 application for the federal grant and said, ''It's hard to have trust.'' More than three dozen tenants have died since 2003.
 Ms. Popkin and Mr. Kelly acknowledged ''bumps along the road'' for the project in the past, but they stressed their desire to rebuild the neighborhood. ''I understand that folks here are frustrated,'' Ms. Popkin said. ''There is a new management at Nycha. We have a commitment to these towers. This is a top priority to move forward.''

HEADLINE: San Francisco Museum Raises $250 Million

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Bucking the downward trend that has plagued the boardrooms of most museums during the recession, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art announced Thursday that it had raised $250 million over the last several months, allowing it to double the size of its endowment and put $150 million toward an ambitious expansion. The expansion is necessary partly because the museum is to be the home of the extensive art collection of Don and Doris Fisher, co-founders of the Gap clothing chain. The Fishers announced in September, shortly before Mr. Fisher's death, that they would lend their works to the museum instead of placing them in a museum that they had planned to build in the Presidio in San Francisco. The modern art museum, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last month, also announced Thursday that the agreement for the Fisher loan would be extended from 25 years, as initially announced, to at least 100 years. The works will be presented in a new wing along with works from the museum's permanent collection and will also be interwoven throughout the museum's other galleries beginning in June. A search will now begin for an architect for the expansion and the museum will continue to work toward raising a total of $480 million for it and the endowment.

HEADLINE: Bank Reform Talks Crumble in Senate

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Two months of Senate negotiations over legislation to rewrite financial regulations -- a top priority of the Obama administration -- fell apart on Friday amid wrangling over a proposal to create a consumer financial protection agency that would oversee credit cards, mortgages and other products. 
 The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, said that Democrats would forge ahead with their own proposal, in the absence of Republican support. That could result in a bitter partisan fight resembling the struggle over health care -- an outcome that Mr. Dodd has said for months he would try to avoid. 
 The administration, which has announced a series of initiatives to help small businesses and is seeking Senate action on a jobs bill next week, gave a guarded response to the breakdown in talks. ''Enacting comprehensive financial reform remains an urgent priority and we believe it is important that the process move forward,'' the deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, said.
 While Republican members of the banking committee expressed hope that a deal could still be brokered, several Democratic members said on Friday that they were resolved to move on. 
 ''A bipartisan bill would be preferable, but not at the expense of it being so weak that it doesn't solve the problems that precipitated the financial crisis,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. 
 Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he hoped the committee could begin marking up a bill later this month. ''Ultimately this will be settled with amendments and votes, and we'll move from there,'' he said. ''We're just trapped in an endless discussion. You've got to stop the discussion and start voting.'' 
 With their majority in the Senate reduced to 59 seats, one short of the margin needed to overcome Republican filibusters, the Democrats will have to secure at least some measure of support from across the aisle.
 Republican lawmakers have said they favor passing some version of a regulatory bill. Both parties have been sensitive to public anger over the bailout of big financial institutions, the high unemployment rate and Wall Street bonuses.
 Mr. Dodd and the top Republican on the committee, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, both left the door open for additional talks.
 ''Last night, Senator Shelby assured me that he is still committed to finding a consensus on financial reform, but for now we have reached an impasse,'' Mr. Dodd said on Friday morning, hours before Congress ceased nearly all work because of an impending snowstorm. 
 Mr. Dodd added, ''While I still hope that we will ultimately have a consensus package, it is time to move the process forward.'' He said he had told his staff to begin drafting a bill that the committee could take up later this month.
 Mr. Shelby stopped short of criticizing the Democrats on the committee, but said the plan for a consumer protection agency would interfere with sound banking regulation. 
 ''I fully support enhancing both consumer protection and safety and soundness regulation,'' Mr. Shelby said. ''I will not support a bill that enhances one at the expense of the other, however. In order to strike the appropriate balance they must be integrated with each other, not separated from each other.''
 President Obama put forward a package of regulatory changes last June, and the House passed a sweeping overhaul in December, largely along partisan lines.
 The House bill would, among other things, create a council of regulators to oversee systemic risk, establish a process for dissolving large institutions without requiring government bailouts, give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay, strengthen the Securities and Exchange Commission's power to protect investors, regulate over-the-counter derivatives and tighten rules for mortgage lenders and credit rating agencies.
 Many, if not most, of those provisions have attracted bipartisan support.
 But a proposal for a separate agency with power to issue regulations governing consumer financial products has emerged as the main sticking point. President Obama has expressed support for the notion, which is contained within the House bill.
 Several people involved in the Dodd-Shelby negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of deference to Mr. Dodd, said the chairman had agreed in principle to concede a new agency in favor of a new consumer protection unit within an existing regulatory body. But these people said Mr. Dodd and Mr. Shelby could not agree on the degree of independence of that unit. 
 Since late last year, four pairs of Senate Banking Committee members -- each with one Democrat and one Republican -- have been meeting to address core elements of the package. 
 Along with the consumer protection agency, Mr. Shelby said that another unresolved issue was how to ''craft a resolution regime that ensures taxpayers will never again bear the losses for risks taken in the private marketplace.'' Senators Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who have been leading the talks on that issue, both said on Friday that they believed a compromise was within reach. 
 Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he believed that the proposal for a consumer protection agency could be potent for Democrats. 
 ''What Chris has been doing is absolutely appropriate: he's been conciliatory but not giving up on principle,'' Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in an interview, referring to Mr. Dodd. ''The public reaction is not going to be favorable to blocking an independent consumer agency. The Republicans will be on the wrong side of this issue, not just substantively, in my judgment, but politically.''
 Heather Booth, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of consumer, labor, civil rights and liberal advocacy organizations, said the impasse could actually help focus public attention. 
 ''With health care having been the center of attention until now, people weren't focused on the solution, because Congress hadn't focused,'' Ms. Booth said. ''It's becoming front and center now.''

HEADLINE: Aetna's Profit Falls as Medical Costs Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Aetna, the health insurance company, said Friday that its fourth-quarter profit fell 15 percent as it continued to struggle with rising medical costs that hurt its performance throughout 2009. The company said medical costs, its largest expense, climbed 14 percent, to $6.1 billion, in the period. That increase was partly offset by a 9 percent increase in premiums. Aetna has said costs rose faster than it expected when it set prices for last year, partly because of the slumping economy. But the chief executive, Ronald A. Williams, said Aetna made changes that were starting to show results. ''To date, we have repriced a significant portion of our commercial insured business and are creating momentum toward the improvement of our long-term operating margin profile,'' Mr. Williams told analysts during a conference call. 
 Aetna earned $165.9 million, or 38 cents a share, in the quarter, down from the $194.7 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $8.76 billion, from 7.76 billion. Excluding one-time items, it said profit totaled 40 cents a share, falling short of the 42 cents analysts had expected. Stock in Aetna, which is based in Hartford, Conn., rose 38 cents, to $29.61 a share.

HEADLINE: Obama Gets His Groove Back

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Where has this Obama been?
 Since the State of the Union address, the president has been bounding about, displaying a new sense of vigor and confidence and a fighter's spirit. He almost looks like the president people thought that he would be -- a paladin, not a pacifist. 
 Last week, he provided a fascinating bit of political theater by toying with House Republicans at their own retreat, dismantling their arguments and disarming their charges. It was impressive. When they asked if he had time for more questions, he responded: ''You know, I'm having fun.'' Score.
 At his New Hampshire town hall on Tuesday, Obama connected with a more colloquial tone, chiding Republicans for voting against the recovery act while glomming onto the glories of the projects it produced: ''They found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too.'' Score again.
 His new persona comes as a welcome reprieve from a year in which he toddled about as if someone had slipped him an Ambien, taking punches and not returning them.
 I have no idea if Nuevo O is here to stay, but I could name a few reasons why it would be a good idea.
 1. His base needs a hit. 
 After months of watching their agenda get mired in misinformation, and after a series of deflating defeats, progressives need a champion, someone to remind them of what it feels like to be on the offensive and not back on their heels. Obama gave them that this week. 
 2. The bipartisan ship has sailed. 
 Obama rode into Washington with his heart set on fixing it. Republicans came out with their hearts set on breaking him. Both paths have led to gridlock. This made him appear effete and the Democrats ineffectual.
 At the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, Obama quoted John F. Kennedy's ''civility is not a sign of weakness.'' Maybe not, but servility is. There comes a time when one must rise to a fight or fall in defeat. Now is that time.
 Besides, no matter how hard he tries, Republicans will not reward his efforts. According to a Fox News poll released on Thursday, only 18 percent of Republicans said they believed that Obama is trying to reach out to Republicans to compromise and change the climate in Washington, and only 14 percent approved of his job performance.
 3. Neutrality is a nonstarter. 
 A study published in The Economic Journal during the summer of 2008 found that voters preferred extreme political positions to moderate ones. It demonstrates a level of commitment and conviction. The lesson: fence-sitting leaves scars, too.
 I would advise this new Obama to stick around for a season. I prefer my presidents walking tall, not sleepwalking.

HEADLINE: Time Is Running Out

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: Palo Alto, Calif. 

 BODY:
 We've now lost 8.4 million jobs in this recession, and a vast majority of them are gone for good. The politicians are clambering aboard the jobs bandwagon, belatedly, but very few are telling the truth about the structural employment problems in the U.S. and the extremely heavy lift that is necessary to halt our declining living standards and get us back to an economy that is self-sustaining.
 We don't hear a lot that is serious about the sorry state of the nation's infrastructure or the trade policies that crippled so many American industries or our inability (or unwillingness) to compete effectively with China when it comes to the new world of energy for the 21st century or our abject failure to provide a quality public education for the next generation of American workers, scientists, artists and entrepreneurs. 
 Speaking at a conference here on Wednesday, Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania said that if we don't act quickly in developing long-term solutions to these and other problems, the United States will be a second-rate economic power by the end of this decade. A failure to act boldly, he said, will result in the U.S. becoming ''a cooked goose.''
 Neither the politicians nor much of the mainstream media are spelling out the severity of these enormous structural problems or the sense of urgency needed to address them. Living standards are sinking in the United States, and there is no coherent vision or plan for reversing that ominous trend over the long term.
 The conference was titled, ''The Next American Economy: Transforming Energy and Infrastructure Investment.'' It was put together by the Brookings Institution and Lazard, the investment banking advisory firm. 
 When Governor Rendell addressed the conference on Wednesday, he used words like ''stunning'' and ''unbelievable'' to describe what has happened to the nation's infrastructure. His words echoed the warnings we've been hearing for years from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which tells us: ''The broken water mains, gridlocked streets, crumbling dams and levees, and delayed flights that come from failing infrastructure have a negative impact on the checkbook and on the quality of life of each and every American.''
 The conference was sparked by a sense of dismay over what has happened to the U.S. economy over the past several years and a feeling that constructive ideas about solutions were being smothered by an obsessive focus on the short-term in this society, and by the chronic dysfunction and hyperpartisanship in much of the government.
 I was struck by the absence of grousing and finger-pointing at the conference and the emphasis on trying to develop new ways to establish an economy that is not based on financial flimflammery, that enhances America's competitive position in the world, and that relieves us of the terrible burden of reliance on foreign energy sources.
 I was also struck by the pervasive sense that if we don't get our act together then the glory days of the go-go American economic empire will fade like the triumphs of an aging Hollywood star. One of the participants raised the very real possibility of Americans having to get used to living in an economy ''that won't be number one,'' an economy that perhaps is more like Germany's.
 Rescuing the U.S. economy will require a commitment, and undoubtedly sacrifices, that need to start now. And it will require leadership that pulls together the best talents from all sectors of the society -- not just business, not just government, but from everywhere.
 Bruce Katz, the director of Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program, discussed some of the steps that need to be taken to remake an economy that has been thrown completely out of whack by frantic, debt-driven consumption, speculative bubbles, exotic financial instruments, and so on.
 A new, saner, more sustainable economy will have to be more export-oriented, powered by cleaner fuels, bolstered by innovation that comes from a renewed focus on research and development, and committed to delivering a better-educated, more highly skilled work force.
 Mr. Katz believes this is doable, but by no means easy. The nation's infrastructure, he said, will have to ''shift from 20th-century models of transport and energy transmission to rapid bus, ubiquitous broadband, congestion pricing, smart grid, high-speed rail and intelligent transport.''
 New ways of financing such transformative changes will have to be developed, linking public and private capital, preferably through the creation of a national infrastructure bank, among other things. The nation's political leaders and the public at large will have to grasp the difference between wasteful spending and crucial investments in the future.
 It's time for serious people to step forward and help lead on these critically important issues. Time is short.

HEADLINE: Goldman Chief's $9 Million Bonus Seen by Some as Show of Restraint

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ERIC DASH; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Once again, a bonus at Goldman Sachs has all of Wall Street talking -- only this time, over how small it is. 
 After weeks of intense speculation, Goldman Sachs disclosed late Friday that its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, would receive an annual bonus valued at $9 million, a figure that, to the surprise of many, put him in the middle of the pay scale for the nation's banking chiefs. 
 While most people can only dream of such a reward, the news was widely seen on Wall Street as a show of restraint and a nod to the uproar in Washington and elsewhere over resurgent pay and profits at banks like Goldman. Indeed, the award represents a fraction of the record $68 million bonus that Mr. Blankfein received in 2007, when Goldman made less money than it did last year. In 2008, in the midst of the financial collapse, he collected no bonus. 
 Mr. Blankfein received no cash bonus. The award is entirely in the form of deferred stock, which he cannot sell for five years.
 Many on Wall Street had been anxiously awaiting the figure, amid talk that the bonus might be anything from nothing to $100 million. 
 ''It takes a lot of the oxygen out of the argument that Goldman's top of the house is overpaid,'' said Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains. ''For running an organization that big, and bringing it through the way he did, nine million is not a lot of money.''
 Goldman made a series of political and business calculations in tallying Mr. Blankfein's rewards. The timing, too, seemed deft: hours earlier, JPMorgan Chase had announced that its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, would receive a $16.6 million bonus and $1 million in salary. For once, Goldman, known for its big paydays, had grabbed the high ground by paying its chief executive less money. At the top, John G. Stumpf, chief of Wells Fargo, was paid $18.4 million in cash and stock for 2009 though he runs a less complex company. Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup vowed to accept only $1 in salary until the bank is profitable.
 For Mr. Blankfein, the news arrived on Friday afternoon, after a tumultuous day of trading on Wall Street. While Mr. Blankfein's bonus had been the subject of internal debate for weeks, the final decision came quickly. 
 On Thursday, the compensation committee of Goldman's 10-member board of independent nonexecutive directors called a meeting for Friday afternoon. Some of the directors convened at Goldman's headquarters at 85 Broad Street, in Lower Manhattan, while others joined in by telephone. Before the close of trading at 4 p.m., the decision was final. Less than an hour later, Goldman disclosed the figure in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Mr. Blankfein, whom the firm insisted was not privy to the discussions, had been traveling in the Middle East and returned to New York only this week.
 Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman, insisted that the timing and size of the award was unrelated to Mr. Dimon's announcement, and he would not say how the directors had arrived at the bonus figure, other than to say: ''It's a reflection of the times. Notwithstanding that there has been some extremely ill-informed speculation and a great deal of unpleasantness, we have shown respect for the environment.''
 A person close to the board, however, said that in their discussion the directors had agreed they needed to send a strong statement that the firm understood the mood of Washington and the public.
 On top of the bonus, Mr. Blankfein will receive a $600,000 cash salary, the same as in previous years, and other perks like a company car and driver.
 The current award must, however, be put in the context of his past compensation -- in 2006 he received $53.4 million, and the firm said that since 2000 he has received $181.5 million in total salary and bonus, though he has cashed out only part of it.
 Goldman Sachs also announced the bonus awards for four other senior executives, including Gary D. Cohn, the firm's president and chief operating officer, and David A. Viniar, the chief finance officer. All received stock valued at $9 million. 
 In December, Goldman announced that its top executives, including Mr. Blankfein, would forgo cash bonuses. Instead, the executives would be paid in the form of special stock -- an arrangement that could still turn out to be enormously lucrative if Goldman's share price rises.
 Many other big banks had disclosed the compensation of their top executives in recent weeks, but Goldman had appeared to delay its announcement, leading to intense speculation about what the firm would do. 
 Many on Wall Street thought Goldman was waiting for a good public relations moment to release the news -- and calculating what figure the public mood could tolerate. 
 Some analysts suggested that Goldman's -- and Wall Street's -- show of restraint would be fleeting, and the banks would quickly return to its ways. 
 ''I am still waiting for one of the banks to come forward with a long-term performance-related incentive plan,'' said Paul Hodgson, a senior compensation analyst at the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research firm. ''They are just making everybody wait for the pay.''

HEADLINE: Britain And Ireland Hail Pact For Ulster

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Ending months of dispute that threatened to bring down Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland on Friday hailed a breakthrough agreement to transfer the province's police and justice system from Britain to local control on April 12. 
 Prime Ministers Gordon Brown of Britain and Brian Cowen of Ireland met near Belfast with Northern Ireland's Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders after a late-night announcement that the main party of the unionists, who are committed to the province's remaining part of Britain, had agreed to the transfer. Handing over the powers has been the most important and contentious of the issues still outstanding in the long-running and still fragile effort to bring peace to the six British-ruled counties of Northern Ireland. 
 ''We are closing the last chapter of a long and troubled story, and we are opening a new chapter for Northern Ireland,'' Mr. Brown said at a news conference with Mr. Cowen. The men spoke alongside Peter Robinson, the head of the predominantly Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein, the mainly Catholic party that has been the historic standard-bearer for a united Ireland. ''I think people have looked over the abyss and said, 'There is no return to the past,' '' Mr. Brown said.
 Reaffirming the crucial role the United States has played as a mediator in the years of peace talks that ended 30 years of bloody conflict in the province, Mr. Brown and Mr. Cowen announced that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton would preside over an investment conference to be held in the province later this year. 
 British officials said that Mrs. Clinton had been an important behind-the-scenes influence in reaching the agreement, and that her international stature could be decisive in drawing support for investment. Behind the plan for the conference lies the hope in London, Dublin and Belfast that creating jobs could help stem rising violence by so-called dissident republicans opposed to the power-sharing deal.
 Mr. Cowen, the Irish leader, called the deal ''an essential step for peace, stability and security in Northern Ireland'' and said the fact that unionists and republicans had ''stretched out their hands and made sure that we got over the line together'' on the police and justice issue -- negotiating for more than 120 hours over the last 10 days, and reaching the brink of failure on several occasions -- boded well for the future. 
 For Mr. Brown, the deal offered a rare political triumph as Britain approached a general election expected to be called for May 6. With Britain's economy yet to begin any significant recovery from the global recession, the 57-year-old Mr. Brown has been relishing opportunities to engage in high-profile activity on issues like Northern Ireland and Afghanistan, perhaps in the hope of offsetting the political liability he suffers from his 10 years as Britain's finance minister before 2007, when British banks began taking the unsustainable risks that have contributed heavily to the country's economic woes.
 In the years of negotiations and crises that have characterized the peace process in Northern Ireland, there have been few issues as fraught as the control of police and justice powers. While many Catholics came to view the police and the courts as tools of the unionists, many Protestants saw Britain's control of law-and-order issues as a bulwark against republican violence.
 With the main political parties now agreed on the transition to local control, the next hurdle will be a vote on the agreement in the provincial assembly at Stormont on March 9, where it is expected to pass handily, despite the bitter opposition of die-hard unionists.

HEADLINE: A Broad U.S. Push to Ease Credit for Small Businesses

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve and other financial regulators prodded banks on Friday to ease financing to small businesses, while President Obama proposed expanding two loan programs run by the Small Business Administration.
 Both steps, coming on the same day the government reported a small drop in the unemployment rate, were a response to the persistent difficulties that small and medium-size businesses have had in securing credit since the recession began. 
 Small businesses were responsible for the creation of 65 percent of new jobs over the last 15 years, the president said. 
 ''The true engine of job creation will always be businesses,'' Mr. Obama said during a visit to Oasis Mechanical Contractors, a company in Lanham, Md., that installs and services heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. 
 ''What government can do is fuel that engine by giving entrepreneurs and companies the support to open their doors and to expand and to hire more workers,'' the president said.
 Mr. Obama's proposal is the latest in a string of initiatives intended to help small businesses. Last week, he proposed a one-year, $33 billion wage subsidy that would include a $5,000-a-worker tax credit for each new hire. This week, he called for using $30 billion from the federal bank bailout fund to create a small-business lending fund. 
 The latest plan, which like the others would need Congressional approval, has two components, both involving the Small Business Administration. 
 One would expand the agency's 504 program, which guarantees loans for real estate development, to cover refinancings. The expansion could help refinance up to $18.7 billion a year in commercial real estate that might otherwise face foreclosure and liquidation, officials estimated. 
 The other would temporarily increase to $1 million, from $350,000, the maximum loan size under a program called S.B.A. Express that provides federally guaranteed financing through a streamlined approval process. 
 Earlier on Friday, the Fed and other regulators warned that small businesses were ''experiencing difficulty in obtaining or renewing credit to support their operations'' and said that banks might have responded to the downturn ''by becoming overly cautious'' in making loans to such companies.
 The Fed has faced political pressure to spur lending. The joint statement came just two days after Ben S. Bernanke was sworn in to a second four-year term as the central bank's chairman. He was reconfirmed by the Senate on Jan. 28 by the narrowest margin for a Fed chairman in the central bank's 96-year history.
 Days before that vote, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, had said he would support Mr. Bernanke, but only with reservations and after having urged the chairman to ease lending to small businesses.
 In the statement, the regulators signaled that examiners of banks, savings and loans and credit unions had been instructed to look favorably on loans to small businesses that might otherwise seem risky. 
 Bank loans to small companies are primarily repaid through cash flow, and secondarily through underlying collateral. As collateral values have fallen, banks have been shy to make loans, fearing that if the loans go bad, examiners might force them to take steep markdowns, which could deplete the capital levels of the banks and further imperil their ability to lend. 
 The Fed also said that banks ''should not automatically refuse credit to sound borrowers because of a borrower's particular industry or geographic location.'' 
 The statement expanded on two earlier statements: one in November 2008 that encouraged banks to make more credit available, and another last October that focused on modifications of commercial real estate loans. 
 Along with the Fed, the statement was issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.
 Observers of bank regulation were skeptical. 
 Ernest T. Patrikis, a partner at White & Case and a former general counsel for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called the encouragement to lend overdue.
 ''This statement should have gone out earlier,'' he said in an interview. ''We shouldn't have waited until now, when it's no secret that small businesses aren't getting credit.''
 Camden R. Fine, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America, said that banks had been cautious because examiners ''have become overly harsh.''
 ''When actual practices by federal bank examiners match the rhetoric of these interagency announcements, we may finally see progress in bank lending to small businesses,'' he said, warning that ''credit conditions will remain very tight'' until then.

HEADLINE: In Visit to Fox News, Jon Stewart Faults Fox News

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Jon Stewart, who already had a reputation for lobbing word grenades at media personalities and outlets that displease him, this week delivered one of the most sustained criticisms of Fox News ever heard on Fox News.
 That network, lambasted by many on the left as an arm of the conservative movement, is a ''cyclonic perpetual emotion machine'' that has ''taken reasonable concerns about this president and this economy and turned it into a full-fledged panic about the next coming of Chairman Mao,'' Mr. Stewart told Bill O'Reilly of Fox.
 Parts of the interview were shown on Wednesday and Thursday evenings on Fox News's most popular program, ''The O'Reilly Factor,'' and were widely praised by television critics. But Mr. Stewart had a lot more to say about Fox in the portions of the interview that were edited out of the television broadcast. 
 The exchanges are notable because Mr. Stewart, the host of ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central, has occasionally strayed beyond his comedy roots into serious media criticism and drawn great attention for doing so. On ''Crossfire'' on CNN in 2004, he claimed the left-right debate format was ''hurting America,'' three months before the program was canceled. Last year he took aim at CNBC for being Wall Street cheerleaders, telling Jim Cramer, the host of its ''Mad Money'' program, that ''the financial news industry is not just guilty of a sin of omission but a sin of commission.''
 This week, invited onto ''The O'Reilly Factor'' by its host, Mr. O'Reilly, Mr. Stewart asserted that Fox News was ''the most passionate and sells the clearest narrative of any news organization,'' then asked with a smirk, ''are you still referring to it in that manner?''
 Mr. O'Reilly defended Fox as a news organization and cited a poll last month by the Public Policy Polling organization that showed Fox News was more widely trusted than any other television news organization.
 Mr. Stewart said Fox had been able to ''mainstream conservative talk radio.'' On television on Wednesday night, the exchange ended there. But in the studio, Mr. Stewart swung harder, saying Fox had mixed the ''media arm of a political party'' with ''a little bit'' of objectivity, something that White House officials have also asserted in recent months.
 Fox News said the interview was edited only for time. A video of the unedited interview was posted on BillOReilly.com and on foxnews.com on Thursday night.
 In the interview and in a subsequent segment, Mr. O'Reilly said Mr. Stewart was basing his complaints ''primarily on two guys, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck.'' But Mr. Stewart insisted that the conservative bent permeated the network and cited ''Fox & Friends,'' the network's entertainment-oriented morning show, as evidence: 
 ''They'll go through, 'These children in second grade are singing the praises of Obama! Do you know they sing the praises of their leader in North Korea?' And then, when the hard news comes on, they say, 'Some people are concerned that they are indoctrinating children.' ''
 Fox News, far and away the most-watched cable news channel, has stoked controversy (and higher ratings) in the first year of the Obama administration by appearing, at times, to be the network of the opposition. 
 In a segment cut from television, Mr. Stewart said: ''Fox News used to be all about: 'You don't criticize a president during war time. It's unacceptable. It's treasonous. It's giving aid and comfort to the enemy.' All of a sudden, for some reason, you can run out there and say Barack Obama is destroying the fabric of this country.''
 Mr. O'Reilly disagreed, saying the network had been respectful to Mr. Obama about the Afghanistan troop deployment decision.
 In another segment cut from television, Mr. Stewart, asked whether he thought Fox was ''set up solely to provide aid and comfort to the Republican Party and the conservative movement,'' replied: ''That's right. That's right.'' Then he added, ''And to make some money.''
 Mr. O'Reilly said on his program on Thursday: ''It was interesting to hear Mr. Stewart put forth that Fox News is in business to help Republicans. I rebutted that, and you can decide who had the stronger argument.''

HEADLINE: Deal Saves N. Ireland Government

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Ending months of dispute that threatened to bring down Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland on Friday hailed a breakthrough agreement to transfer the province's police and justice system from Britain to local control on April 12. 
 Prime Ministers Gordon Brown of Britain and Brian Cowen of Ireland met near Belfast with Northern Ireland's Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders after a late-night announcement that the main party of the unionists, who are committed to the province remaining part of Britain, had agreed to the handover. Transfer of the powers has been the most important and contentious of the issues still outstanding in the long-running and still fragile effort to bring peace to the six British-ruled counties of Northern Ireland.
 ''We are closing the last chapter of a long and troubled story, and we are opening a new chapter for Northern Ireland,'' Mr. Brown said at a joint news conference with Mr. Cowen. The men spoke alongside Peter Robinson, the head of the predominantly Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, and Martin McGuinness of the Sinn Fein, the mainly Catholic party that has been the historic standard-bearer for a united Ireland.
 ''I think people have looked over the abyss and said, 'There is no return to the past,' '' Mr. Brown said. 
 Reaffirming the crucial role the United States has played as a mediator in the years of peace talks that ended 30 years of bloody conflict in the province, Mr. Brown and Mr. Cowen announced that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton would preside over an investment conference to be held in the province later this year. 
 British officials said that Mrs. Clinton had been an important behind-the-scenes influence in reaching the agreement, and that her international stature could be decisive in drawing support for investment. Behind the plan for the conference lies the hope in London, Dublin and Belfast that creating jobs, particularly for unemployed youths, could help stem a rising incidence of violence, including attacks on the police, by so-called dissident republicans opposed to the power-sharing deal.
 The news conference announcing the agreement to shift to local control of the police, the prosecution service and the courts reflected another element in the political matrix that has kept Northern Ireland on the peace track ever since the watershed Good Friday agreement of 1998 -- the role played by the Irish government. Giving Ireland a direct role in the peace process has been one of the crucial factors in sustaining the peace process through years of crises and setbacks, and preventing a slide back into the widespread violence that killed about 3,500 people during the years of the so-called ''troubles.''
 Mr. Cowen, the Irish leader, called the deal ''an essential step for peace, stability and security in Northern Ireland'' and said the fact that unionists and republicans had ''stretched out their hands and made sure that we got over the line together'' on the police and justice issue -- negotiating for more than 120 hours over the last 10 days, and reaching the brink of failure on several occasions -- boded well for the future of power sharing. 
 For Mr. Brown, the late-night deal offered a rare political triumph as Britain approached a general election expected to be called for May 6. With Britain's economy still to begin any significant recovery from the global recession, the 57-year-old Mr. Brown has been relishing opportunities to engage in high-profile activity on issues like Northern Ireland and Afghanistan, perhaps in the hope of offsetting the political liability he suffers from his 10 years as Britain's finance minister before 2007, when British banks began taking the unsustainable risks that have contributed heavily to the country's economic woes.
 In the years of convoluted negotiations and crises that have characterized the peace process in Northern Ireland, there have been few issues as fraught, politically, as the control of police and justice powers. Against the background of decades of communal violence, the question of where ultimate control over law-and-order issues resides -- until now, with Britain, but henceforth with a yet-to-be-created justice ministry in Belfast -- has carried momentous emotional and symbolic significance. While many Catholics came to view the police and courts during the years of strife as a tool of the unionists, many Protestants took a mirror-image view, seeing Britain's control of law-and-order issues as a crucial bulwark against republican violence, and as a guarantor of the province remaining part of Britain.
 With the main political parties now agreed on the transition to local control, the next hurdle will be a vote on the agreement in the provincial assembly at Stormont on March 9, where it is expected to pass handily, despite the bitter opposition of die-hard unionists.
 In the wake of Friday's announcement, political commentators in the province were saying the pact would make little practical difference to the way that police and justice issues are handled, at least in the near term, not least because the peace accords have already seen the establishment of a police supervisory board based in Belfast, with unionist and republican appointees, and arrangements that see the province's police chief directly accountable to the board.
 The key to the political breakthrough on the issue appeared to lie in a shift of political calculus by Mr. Robinson, the unionist leader. Sinn Fein had demanded that the law-and-order powers be transferred to local control, and had threatened in recent weeks to collapse the power-sharing government over the issue. Mr. Robinson, fearing a unionist backlash, had insisted that ''community confidence'' among unionists would not permit it.
 Partly as a negotiating tactic, Mr. Robinson demanded a quid-pro-quo from Sinn Fein before any concession on police powers -- the disbanding of the province's parades commission, which has frustrated unionists by curbing the marches that the Orange Order, a powerful body among Protestants, has sought to stage every July through Catholic neighborhoods. That issue was finessed as part of Friday's accord, with an agreement that Mr. Robinson and Mr. McGuinness will set up as six-member working group that will seek new ways of achieving ''cross-community support'' for future marches, with a mandate to bring in recommendations before the ''marching season'' of 2011.
 Political commentators said the parades issue was of less importance to Mr. Robinson and the Democratic Unionists than the threat of Sinn Fein collapsing the Belfast government and precipitating a new provincial election that would expose Mr. Robinson's party to possible defeat by right-wing unionists opposed to any concessions on police and justice. With power-sharing now saved, these commentators said, Mr. Robinson will be hoping for a political ''bounce'' in the British national election, in which the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein will be the province's leading contenders. 
 On Friday, at least, the mood at Hillsborough was one of unusual -- not to say exceptional -- good will between the province's historic foes. 
 Mr. Robinson and Mr. McGuinness stood at ease beside each other at the news conference, each praising the other's flexibility in reaching the agreement, though carefully avoiding any public handshake, as they have throughout the nearly two years they have jointly led the Belfast government. 
 Mr. Robinson struck the more somber note, referring to the pact as one involving ''life and death issues'' for the people of Northern Ireland. But he also heralded the agreement as a historic breakthrough for power sharing, saying it marked a break with what he called ''the stop-start devolution and continual crises'' that have marked the peace process. ''Not this time,'' he said.
 Mr. McGuinness, a former chief of staff for the Irish Republican Army, was more effusive -- as befitting the principal spokesman for the party, Sinn Fein, that was widely regarded as the principal beneficiary of the pact. He said the agreement with the unionists had made it ''absolutely clear that we are not going back to the past, and that we are going to go forward together.'' He added, ''This might just be the day when the political process in the north came of age.''

HEADLINE: Put Some Pop in the Question

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI; June M. Cuddy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
''IF you're only going to propose once in your life, you may as well do it with a bang,'' said Michael Arnot, founder of GroomGroove.com, a wedding and engagement Web site for men. To help light that fuse, here are 10 of the most compelling methods (all successful) submitted in 2009: 
 For Darren Haber and Elaine Schmidt, the setting was a surprise helicopter ride over Los Angeles. They wore headsets to communicate and to protect their ears from the noise. As the chopper flew over the Hollywood sign, Mr. Haber passed Ms. Schmidt two sheets of folded paper. The first said ''Will U'' and the second said ''Marry me?'' She nodded in shock, regained her composure, then -- pushing the intercom button --said ''yes.'' 
 Moe Tarkinow waited for Susan Mendik's 60th birthday celebration, a dinner at a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan. While Ms. Mendik had the restaurant print the names of each guest at the birthday party on sets of chopsticks, Mr. Tarkinow secretly had a pair made with the name Suzy Tarkinow. When he stood up and very publicly presented the chopsticks to her, ''the place erupted and I was in total shock,'' the bride remembered.
 Eric Epstein asked Rebecca Ingis to marry him in a most lyrical way. He had brought her back to Northwestern University, where they had met, for what she thought was a reunion and jam session with Mr. Epstein's school rock band, the Rocket Pockets. Ms. Ingis noticed the student lounge was full of candles and flowers. Mr. Epstein grabbed a microphone. 
 ''As soon as I heard the chords of 'I'm Yours' by Jason Mraz, I realized that Eric was proposing,'' Ms. Ingis recalled. ''I started shaking, and of course, I said 'yes.' '' 
 Andrew Hutson and Meaghan Mulholland were digging for crystals at Wegner's Quartz Crystal Mines in the Ouachita Mountains, in west-central Arkansas, when Mr. Hutson surprised her by pretending to stumble on a diamond ring mixed with the debris on his shovel. 
 Robert Percival, 21, sought to prove that an engagement ring is not always the most important thing, when he asked Jana Rubenstein in a Nordstrom store in Seattle after buying her a pair of sunglasses. ''I didn't have a ring or any money at the time,'' said Mr. Percival, then a student who was unemployed. ''Chanel sunglasses are expensive, but not as expensive as a ring.''
 Ms. Rubenstein -- who eventually received a ring from Mr. Percival that had belonged to one of his great-grandmothers -- fondly recalled how ''he proposed to me and then put the sunglasses on my face.''
 ''I thought it was adorable,'' she said.
 Joy Fahrenkrog and Timothy Foster, a onetime couple who had not seen each other in seven years, were reunited when Mr. Foster, in Beijing for the 2008 Olympic Games, recognized Ms. Fahrenkrog in an ad in a magazine. Mr. Foster sent her a message on Facebook and learned that she was in Beijing working for The Olympic News Service. They rekindled their romance -- once over a dinner of silkworms and cicadas. And by the end of the second week, at midnight in a paddleboat on a lake in Beijing, Mr. Foster made the move. 
 Food provided the inspiration for Brian Mencher, a lawyer who was then a cook at Bouley in Manhattan. He prepared an elaborate 10-course meal for Sarah Harris at his home. ''Each dish was exquisite but small,'' Mr. Mencher said. ''The theme was: 'Only one. Only one bite, and only one Sarah.' ''
 Another chef, Jimmy Bradley, owner of the Red Cat and the Harrison, two Manhattan restaurants, chose a site far from his kitchens -- in Hawaii, on the Kona Coast -- to ask Rebecca Babcock. On Christmas eve, he presented her with a diamond ring atop a piece of coral that Ms. Babcock had picked up during a walk together.
 Antonius Kufferath asked Sue Meng on a rugged beach north of Lisbon. As waves crashed against the cliffs, Mr. Kufferath read from a handwritten letter in which he addressed the ways their love had been tested, ''and his faith in the enduring strength of our bond,'' the bride said.
 Ariel Glasner bravely decided to ask Aliza Yudkoff on their first camping trip together, in Susquehanna State Park in Maryland. While she sat by a campfire, Mr. Glasner, wearing a T-shirt, shorts and hiking boots, went to get something from his car. He returned in a suit and tie, and carrying a rose and a ring. 
 After she said yes, they sat together on a camping mat and ate s'mores.

HEADLINE: A Globe Still In Need Of Steel

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
The steel industry, though buffeted by crises in past decades, remains a core part of the economy. We may now be in the information age rather than the industrial age, but people still need steel for things like cars, buildings, pipelines, machinery and appliances. 
 Data from the World Steel Association shows an industry that, like many others, took a hit from the recession: crude output declined 8 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. But there were some geographical variations. While production plummeted in the United States and dropped in many other countries, it climbed in China. India eked out a gain, and the Middle East also showed an increase. 
 In the United States, the biggest steel-producing states include Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, according to the United States Steel Manufacturers Association. And Pennsylvania remains a maker of steel, though at nothing near the level it was in Andrew Carnegie's day.

HEADLINE: O.K., Russia, Time to Work It

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
MOSCOW
 IT is easy to mistake Alex Reznik for one of the thick-necked barrel-chested bodyguards who stalk the corridors of the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow, Russia's most glamorous hotel. 
 Only his track pants give him away. He is a personal trainer, a profession relatively new to a city better known for hedonism than health. 
 Mr. Reznik, 41, was born in the Soviet Union, where he served in the military. After leaving Russia and finding success in Manhattan with his own gym, Complete Body, he has returned home to manage the Ritz gym. He hopes to cash in on the wealthy Russians' newfound love of, as they say here, ''feetnis.'' For the elite, a gym membership and a personal trainer seem to be as necessary these days as an Armani suit or a Vuitton purse. 
 ''In the last three to five years, you see Russian businessmen who are in shape, who are drinking water,'' Mr. Reznik said. ''People have decided that they want to live longer.'' 
 On a recent day, Andrei Malakhov, a popular television host, was tossing a medicine ball with Mr. Reznik, as Ksenia Sokolova, the deputy editor of the Russian edition of GQ magazine, powered through some crunches. ''If you look good, you will never be without work,'' said Mr. Malakhov, 37, adding with a chuckle, ''If my career on television doesn't work out, I can at least find work in some strip bar in Florida.'' 
 Mr. Reznik's services don't come cheaply. Gym membership fees are as high as $23,000 a year; a one-hour private session at home costs $200 to $300. 
 But even with the global economic downturn, the Ritz gym, which has been open for 16 months, has done well. Clients are on a steady uptick; there are two to three new members on average a week. Mr. Reznik and his trainers serve more than 200 people.
 Ms. Sokolova, of GQ, who is also 37, said she started seriously working out only three years ago, more out of necessity than desire. 
 ''For people living in my circles, this way of life is a must,'' she said after a workout with one of Mr. Reznik's assistants. ''I am terribly lazy, for instance, and have to drag myself to the gym, but I go.''
 During the Soviet era, physical fitness was trumpeted with totalitarian zeal, but much of the athletic infrastructure benefited only a handful of top Olympic-caliber athletes. Today, gyms and fitness centers can be found across the country. Two of the largest Russian fitness chains, World Class and Planet Fitness, have more than 30 locations between them in Moscow. Fresh fruits and vegetables are in most cities year-round (as are McDonald's and other fast-food chains). Even an occasional jogger can be seen braving Moscow's inclement weather and maniacal drivers. 
 The country's leaders have also promoted exercise. Vladimir V. Putin, the former president and now the prime minister, has been the country's biggest fitness cheerleader. He has a black belt in judo and a fondness for swimming and skiing. More than once, he has exposed his barrel chest for the cameras. Dmitri A. Medvedev, the current president, continues the drill; he skis and practices yoga.
 Their examples notwithstanding, gym culture is elite culture. Heavy smoking and drinking remains in place, and men continue to have a life expectancy of about 60 years. And in spite of the growing number of gyms, most Russians do not have the money for, or access to, a gym -- nor the interest. ''There is mass interest in beer,'' said Kirill Vishnepolsky, the editor in chief of the Russian edition of Men's Health Magazine. He said that while a few watch their health, ''their numbers are not nearly as high as in Europe, and their numbers are not growing.''
 Whatever the obstacles, Mr. Reznik has big hopes for his fitness regimen. He said he plans to open his own gym in Moscow soon. And he wants to reintroduce some fitness strategies that he learned when training soldiers in the Soviet Army. His workouts -- variations of push-ups, sit-ups and balancing exercises -- often require little more than bodyweight. He blends the military toughness with martial arts, yoga, Pilates and meditation, as well as dietary and medical coaching. Deepak Chopra, the guru of alternative medicine and wellness, has been a mentor and a client since 2002. 
 ''He is a hard trainer, but he also understands everything about diet and the rules of proportionality and mental well-being,'' Mr. Chopra said in a telephone interview from New York. ''Most trainers are just into, you know, cardiovascular conditioning and weight training and don't go beyond that.''
 Mr. Reznik said he is not allowed to name many of his 200 or so Moscow clients. Some top the Forbes Russian billionaires list, he said, and some are members of Parliament. 
 But as powerful as his clients may be, Mr. Reznik has limits. ''Lots of clients request extra substances of which I don't approve,'' he said. ''I'm talking about testosterone shots and chemicals, which you can still get in Russia.''
 And a few clients, he said, still come to workouts with alcohol on their breath.

 BODY:
THE GREAT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
 Its Rise to Preeminence, Its Indispensable National Role, Why It Must Be Protected
 By Jonathan R. Cole
 616 pp. PublicAffairs. $35
 Of the top 20 universities in the world, according to one 2008 reckoning, just three were outside the United States. Of the top 50, just 14 were. American colleges and universities are unquestionably pre-eminent in teaching and research, attracting students and faculty members from around the world. We may no longer be the nation that exports cars. But we are the nation that exports higher education.
 This is a relatively new phenomenon. Before the 1940s many of America's greatest scholars and scientists went abroad to study. Americans have won a majority of Nobel Prizes in science and medicine since 1955, but before 1935 Americans took home far fewer of those trophies. 
 As provost of Columbia University for 14 years and a professor of sociology and dean of faculties before that, Jonathan R. Cole is in an excellent position to write about the rise of the American research university and its special contribution to American life. In ''The Great American University,''he makes a case for the extraordinary role such institutions play in improving our daily lives. He also argues that these ''jewels in our nation's crown'' face a host of serious threats. 
 As the parents of every prospective college student know all too well, America offers a mind-boggling array of choices. About 1,600 public and nonprofit private institutions grant a bachelor's degree, while an additional 1,100 two-year colleges are often the gateway to a four-year education. But Cole is concerned primarily with research universities (and medical schools), the 125 or so institutions that do the most to foster innovations that ''enhance our standard of living and our quality of life.''
 He lists their dazzling achievements, which in biology and medicine include findings on gene-splicing, recombinant DNA, retroviruses, cancer therapies, cochlear implants, the fetal ultrasound scanner, the hepatitis B vaccine, prions, stem cells, organ transplantation and even a treatment for head lice. In the physical sciences, universities have contributed to the Hubble telescope, lasers, LEDs, bar codes, radar, transistors, M.R.I. technology and numerous advances in computing. In a chapter on the social sciences, he cites, among many others, such useful innovations as theories of human capital and social mobility, research in linguistics and even the use of prices to reduce traffic jams. 
 No one can for a moment doubt the special role universities play in innovations that arise from research in pure science and an interest in solving problems. But a 150-page inventory like the one Cole provides here tells us as much about why some universities are ''great'' as a list of names of accomplished people in a large family shows us why their family is ''great'' relative to others. Moreover, it does nothing to illuminate whether universities did it alone and what kind of incentives were used to enhance researcher productivity.
 Private enterprise and government agencies work with universities, as Cole's own roll call of great achievements demonstrates; they also compete with them. For example, the University of California scientist who isolated the gene for insulin founded Chiron. The cancer drug Gleevec originated in research at M.I.T. and U.C.L.A. but was produced by Novartis. The fetal scanner was produced by Physionic Engineering Inc., formed by researchers who had left the University of Colorado. Organs can be transplanted only with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine, developed by Sandoz (now Novartis). The head-lice shampoo developed at Purdue was marketed by Nature's Sunshine. The Hubble telescope was a joint venture among the European Space Agency, NASA and others, though the idea came from a Princeton astrophysicist. The laser came from research at American universities and Bell Labs.
 Cole notes these collaborations but does little to address the numerous questions they raise. What is the optimal division of research among universities, private enterprise and the government? Some universities allow faculty members to hold patents; some give them joint interests in private sector ventures. Which arrangement is most advantageous for research output? Which is best for the integrity of the university? ''At Columbia, we pursued technology transfer aggressively,'' Cole writes. ''If we succeeded, we could use the resources generated to compete effectively with wealthier universities.'' But was Cole really just acting as a modern Robin Hood, or does the profit motive pervert the mission of his and other universities?
 According to Cole, the current threats to the American university don't come from the outside -- no other nation's universities are within striking distance -- but from within our borders and even within the university itself. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, foreign students and professors find it more difficult to venture to the United States. Cole devotes two chapters to the Bush administration, which he sees as a ''frightening example of how the distrust of scholarly and scientific work -- because it challenges the ideological views of the prince -- can begin to seriously erode the structure of knowledge production that has made our universities the finest in the world.'' 
 But he also sees a grave threat from inequalities among the great universities. A few universities have colossal endowments, but most do not. In 2008, before the financial crisis, 76 had endowments of more than $1 billion; 19 (including Columbia) had endowments of more than $5 billion; and 6 had endowments exceeding $10 billion. ''The alarming growth of inequality among university endowments over the past two decades has produced an unnerving potential for a few institutions to be able to dominate the competition for talent,'' thus sapping vital competition, Cole argues. But are such inequalities good or bad? Could 125 equally sized automobile firms produce cars as cheaply as a few very large ones? Probably not. So why isn't that the case for university research as well? 
 In his conclusion, Cole plays with the notion that universities could engage in cross subsidies, as in baseball, where a luxury tax applies to total payroll. Only one team can win, and taxing rich teams keeps the game more interesting. But knowledge creation, unlike baseball, is not a zero sum game. Everyone can win.
 Cole then reverses course and proposes cost-saving mergers among universities. Provosts may see institutional boundaries, but professors, separated by miles and oceans, already work together, sharing research ideas, course syllabuses and students. University researchers are truly scholars without borders; ideas do not wear school colors.
 Today, the greatest threats to American higher education probably do not concern any of the things Cole discusses. Rather, they relate to the openness of the system and the academic preparedness of its students, who, as Cole acknowledges at the outset, play almost no role in this volume. But teaching and research cannot be so easily separated. The great research universities educate a substantial fraction of all four-year undergraduates and produce more than three-quarters of all Ph.D.'s. As Cole acknowledges, ''excellence in teaching and excellence in research'' are ''mutually reinforcing.''
 But many students are finding it harder to gain access to that teaching. In 1980 average private tuition was 20 percent of median family income, but it is 50 percent today; average public tuition was 4 percent of median family income in 1980 and is 11 percent today. We have witnessed, just this past year, the vulnerability of the great California system.
 American universities became the very best in the world because of the nation's early commitment to universal high school education. Maintaining excellence at the highest educational levels requires sustaining the pipeline from the lower levels. Without renewed commitment to preparedness and access, the great American university may not remain great.

HEADLINE: How to Survive a Very Long Fall

BYLINE: Compiled by THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
How to Survive a Very Long Fall
 In Popular Mechanics, Dan Koeppel writes that if you're going to fall 35,000 feet from a plane without a parachute and live, it's probably best to ride a piece of debris on the way down. 
 Granted, the odds of surviving a six-mile plummet are extraordinarily slim, but at this point you've got nothing to lose by understanding your situation. There are two ways to fall out of a plane. The first is to free-fall, or drop from the sky with absolutely no protection or means of slowing your descent. The second is to become a wreckage rider, a term coined by Massachusetts-based amateur historian Jim Hamilton, who developed the Free Fall Research Page -- an online database of nearly every imaginable human plummet ... Surviving a plunge surrounded by a semiprotective cocoon of debris is more common than surviving a pure free-fall, according to Hamilton's statistics; 31 such confirmed or ''plausible'' incidents have occurred since the 1940s. Free-fallers constitute a much more exclusive club, with just 13 confirmed or plausible incidents, including perennial ''Ripley's Believe It or Not'' superstar Alan Magee -- blown from his B-17 on a 1943 mission over France. The New Jersey airman ... fell 20,000 feet and crashed into a train station; he was subsequently captured by German troops, who were astonished at his survival.
 Just Try Chewing These Mushrooms
 In Time, Adam Fisher writes about Philip Ross and his farm just outside Monterey, Calif., Far West Fungi, where he's developing a ''super-eco'' building material from the thin, white, rootlike fibers of mushrooms. Underground, they form a vast network called a mycelium: 
 Mycelium doesn't taste very good, but once it's dried, it has some remarkable properties. It's nontoxic, fireproof and mold- and water-resistant, and it traps more heat than fiberglass insulation. It's also stronger, pound for pound, than concrete. In December, Ross completed what is believed to be the first structure made entirely of mushroom ... The 500 bricks he grew at Far West Fungi were so sturdy that he destroyed many a metal file and saw blade in shaping the 'shrooms into an archway 6 feet high and 6 feet wide. Dubbed Mycotectural Alpha, it is currently on display at a gallery in Germany.
 Nutty as ''mycotecture'' sounds, Ross may be onto something bigger than an art project. A promising start-up named Ecovative is building a 10,000-square-foot myco-factory in Green Island, N.Y. ''We see this as a whole new material, a woodlike equivalent to plastic,'' says C.E.O. Eben Bayer.
 Driver's Licenses for the Internet?
 Blogging on the Davos economic summit at The Curious Capitalist, Barbara Kiviat reports that Craig Mundie, Microsoft's chief research and technology officer, proposed ''driver's licenses'' for the Internet:
 What Mundie is proposing is to impose authentication. He draws an analogy to automobile use. If you want to drive a car, you have to have a license (not to mention an inspection, insurance, etc.). If you do something bad with that car, like break a law, there is the chance that you will lose your license and be prevented from driving in the future. In other words, there is a legal and social process for imposing discipline. Mundie imagines three tiers of Internet ID: one for people, one for machines and one for programs (which often act as proxies for the other two).
 Now, there are, of course, a number of obstacles to making such a scheme be reality. Even here in the mountains of Switzerland I can hear the worldwide scream go up: ''But we're entitled to anonymity on the Internet!'' Really? Are you? Why do you think that?
 Mundie pointed out that in the physical world we are implicitly comfortable with the notion that there are certain places we're not allowed to go without identifying ourselves. Are you allowed to walk down the street with no one knowing who you are? Absolutely. Are you allowed to walk into a bank vault and still not give your name? Hardly.
 Voila, a Factory in Your Garage
 In his 2006 book ''The Long Tail,'' Chris Anderson held that the abundant choices of the Web were shifting the economy and society toward niche interests and products in the long tail of the demand curve. Now in his magazine, Wired, the editor says the shift is progressing beyond ''the long tail of bits'' to the analog world:
 The same is happening to manufacturing -- the long tail of things. The tools of factory production, from electronics assembly to 3-D printing, are now available to individuals, in batches as small as a single unit. Anybody with an idea and a little expertise can set assembly lines in China into motion with nothing more than some keystrokes on their laptop. A few days later, a prototype will be at their door, and once it all checks out, they can push a few more buttons and be in full production, making hundreds, thousands, or more. They can become a virtual micro-factory, able to design and sell goods without any infrastructure or even inventory; products can be assembled and drop-shipped by contractors who serve hundreds of such customers simultaneously. ...''Three guys with laptops'' used to describe a Web startup. Now it describes a hardware company, too.
 Paying by the Word
 The simple, inexpensive ''fair use'' copyright system under which the printed word has thrived is now in grave peril, Lawrence Lessigwrites in The New Republic. He says the recent Google digital-copying settlement portends expense and legal hassles like those that stifle documentary filmmakers who depend on archival footage:
 The deal constructs a world in which control can be exercised at the level of a page, and maybe even a quote. It is a world in which every bit, every published word, could be licensed. ...We begin to sell access to knowledge the way we sell access to a movie theater, or a candy store, or a baseball stadium. We create not digital libraries, but digital bookstores: a Barnes & Noble without the Starbucks. ... Before we release a gaggle of lawyers to police every quotation appearing in any book, can we stop for a moment to consider whether this way of organizing access to culture makes sense?

JESUS, JOBS, AND JUSTICE
 African American Women and Religion
 By Bettye Collier-Thomas
 Illustrated. 695 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $37.50
 In 1995, one million black men -- give or take a couple of hundred thousand -- gathered on the National Mall in Washington. The Million Man March bested the March on Washington of 1963 in turnout but otherwise fell far short of that historic benchmark. It was a rebellion without a cause, lacking any specific political agenda, and its organizer, the notorious demagogue Louis Farrakhan, was as repellent as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring. Perhaps worst of all, the Million Man March announced its chauvinism in its very name, deliberately excluding half the black community. 
 Unfortunately, the civil rights movement has often lagged on the question of women's equality even as it has led the nation on matters of race. Much of the blame for this must be borne by the religious institutions that have played a predominant role in the struggle for racial justice. Until recently, most black churches refused to grant women leadership roles, depriving them of the platform that so many black men have used to rally followers and challenge injustice. 
 Despite these affronts, black women have remained the most faithful and abiding servants of the church, and they have been among the most diligent and effective activists for racial justice. In ''Jesus, Jobs, and Justice,'' Bettye Collier-Thomas, a professor of history at Temple University, tells the untold stories of scores of religious and politically active black women, their organizations, informal gatherings and intellectual movements. For readers who imagine that the religious and political activism of Sojourner Truth, Mary McLeod Bethune and Rosa Parks is exceptional, the book will be a revelation. The author details the contributions of black women to almost every important aspect of the struggle for racial justice. The book weaves its many smaller stories into the broad fabric of the black experience, beginning in the early days of slavery and covering the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and the civil rights and black power movements, before arriving at today's tense moment of renewed hope and familiar anxiety. 
 The progressive black women of ''Jesus, Jobs, and Justice'' fought for respect from the male-dominated churches in which they worked, even as they confronted the common enemy of white racism. An especially absorbing chapter describes the experiences of black women missionaries in Liberia, Congo, Nigeria and Sierra Leone during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These women overcame the resistance and paternalism of black and white church leaders who thought black women should restrict their philanthropic activities to the narrow domestic sphere, only to encounter condescending European missionaries and exploitative colonists who feared they would spread ''radical ideas'' of racial equality to the native population once they arrived in Africa. 
 The book also explores the fraught relationship between black and white feminists, who share a commitment to women's equality but have clashed because many black women have seen feminism as a distraction from the struggle for racial justice and a threat to an embattled black masculinity. And it shows how chauvinistic men have exploited this concern -- by the time of the Million Man March, it had proved to be little more than a cheap justification for sexism.
 For the most part, Collier-Thomas writes with the cadence and detachment of the professional historian. That makes the book reassuringly authoritative, but it can also make for dense reading. A blizzard of people, places, organizations and anecdotes can be disorienting, and instead of a discrete central narrative that might keep wandering minds on course, the book contains multiple narratives and delicately interlaced themes. 
 Despite her academic tenor, Collier-Thomas is obviously passionate about her subject, and she occasionally editorializes. A small but telling example: In describing the Rev. James H. Cone's controversial ''black liberation theology'' -- which the Rev. Jeremiah Wright introduced to much of the world in the heat of the 2008 presidential contest -- she writes that Cone ''demonstrated how a historically accurate interpretation of the Bible leads to the conclusion that black power is a legitimate expression of the Gospel in a particular situation of oppression.'' Surely a more dispassionate author would leave it to others to judge whether Cone's argument was persuasive. 
 For Collier-Thomas, it's an article of faith that religious conviction has been indispensable to the battles against racism, class exploitation and sexism: ''Motivated by their deep religious convictions . . . black women worked long and hard . . . to improve the economic, social and political status of females, blacks and other minorities.'' She brusquely dismisses those who question why politically progressive black women have tolerated sexist and often corrupt religious organizations as ''critics, pundits and outsiders'' who ''often hold blacks to a higher standard than whites.'' 
 Collier-Thomas rightly insists that the church ''represents a way of life and has been at the center of black life.'' But that very centrality makes obscure the role of religious faith as such in the struggle for racial justice. Because churches were the most important autonomous organizations in the black community, they were the natural places for oppositional social movements to form; in a sense, the church played the same role in the civil rights movement that the tavern and the cafe did in many European social movements. 
 And if faith inspired the struggle against injustice, it may also have discouraged the critical posture that would have allowed people to detect and challenge malfeasance, abuse and prejudice by those in positions of religious authority. Collier-Thomas reminds us that for every courageous and self-sacrificing religious leader, like Martin Luther King Jr., there are several less altruistic figures. Consider, for instance, the misdeeds of people like Bishop William H. Hillery of the A.M.E. Zion Church, who was defrocked in 1884 after decades of embezzlement, violence, alcohol abuse and sexual transgressions, and the Rev. Henry J. Lyons of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., who was sentenced to five years in federal prison after embezzling $4 million from his church in the 1990s, partly to support ''a bevy of mistresses.'' 
 Collier-Thomas also reminds us that after the Rev. Jesse Jackson carried on an extramarital affair, he shamelessly turned a church service at which he was to atone for his indiscretion into a self-serving ''media event.'' (To this list of miscreants we might add the ostentatious Rev. Al Sharpton and the self-obsessed Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who, after his demagogic sermons were posted on YouTube, did his best to remain in the limelight despite the damage to Barack Obama.) 
 Collier-Thomas treats these and numerous other dramatic scandals as serious lapses of faith, and she frankly acknowledges many instances of religiously motivated bigotry, of which widespread antigay bias is the most conspicuous today. Still, she sees the church as a fundamentally benevolent institution that can be cured of these blemishes. But ''Jesus, Jobs, and Justice'' suggests a plausible counterreading: abuse of authority and unexamined prejudice are typical of the religious complexion generally -- they are the dark side of faith, the price to be paid for the fortitude and selflessness that religious conviction often inspires. 
 The women in this book are heroic and their stories moving, but their fight for respect and authority in the churches they worked so hard to build and support evokes the melancholia of unrequited love. It's as if only a faith strong enough to endure slavery and overcome Jim Crow could compel them to give so much to institutions that offered them so little in return.

HEADLINE: The Bonus Bounce

BYLINE: By HILARY STOUT

 BODY:
IF the mix of optimism and uncertainty that pervades the New York residential real estate market right now can be symbolized by one property, a leading candidate may well be the penthouse at 1055 Park Avenue.
 The two-bedroom two-bath duplex, atop a new all-glass condominium building on the narrowest of lots in one of the most exclusive of neighborhoods, went on the market on Oct. 5, at an asking price of $9.3 million. Within 17 days the price was slashed, to $7.5 million. And there it has stood.
 Now, at last, a buyer has come along who wants to make an offer. But one thing is holding him back. He won't proceed until he learns the exact dollar amount of the bonus he is expecting from his employer, a Wall Street bank. 
 And so it is with much of the New York-area market, from downtown lofts to Hamptons mansions. With the outsize bonus returning to Wall Street this year, brokers and sellers are holding their breath. For the past few months there have been signs that the market is reawakening, and an infusion of ''banker cash'' could be just the catalyst it needs to spark a full-fledged recovery. 
 But just how powerful a force the bonus money will be is still in question. For all the bankers showing up at open houses, deal after deal seems to be in limbo, its fate hinging on bonus money, as with the penthouse at 1055 Park.
 ''The bankers are back,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group. But, she said, this year the effect is ''more about the confidence than the cash.''
 By that she means that reports of large bonus pools at Wall Street firms have contributed to an overall sense among prospective buyers that things are getting better, not worse. And brokers say that the rise of the stock market last year, along with very low mortgage rates and prices that have sunk a good 20 to 25 percent below 2007 highs, had already started to calm the nerves of buyers at all income levels. Now there is a growing sense that the best deals will be history once the bonus buyers start signing contracts.
 In one indication of increasing interest in higher-end properties, searches for listings of New York City homes priced above $2 million and above $5 million on the real estate search engine Trulia.com have grown significantly. In December 2009, the latest full month for which figures were available, searches for homes over $2 million grew 24 percent compared with December 2008. Searches for homes priced above $5 million increased 13 percent over the same period. 
 No one expects a return to the days when a banker, bonus in hand, went out, looked at five fancy properties in a day and picked one. Brokers say that Wall Street clients are much more careful in their shopping and deal-making these days -- and that, like everyone else, they are looking for bargains.
 ''Even my customers who are billionaires are shopping smart,'' said Susan Breitenbach, a senior vice president at Corcoran in the Hamptons. Another change: many bonuses -- particularly those of the highest echelon of earners -- will be paid in stock this year, not cash, a curb on any impetus toward reckless spending. 
 Nevertheless, some transactions that seem more reminiscent of 2006 than the past year are starting to emerge:
 In the Hamptons, a buyer from Wall Street paid $19 million for an oceanfront property in Sagaponack last month. Word is he plans to tear it down. 
 A three-bedroom condo at 1 Morton Square in the West Village went on the market for $2.75 million in early January. It was snapped up in just four days, for more than the asking price. There were three all-cash offers -- from a Goldman Sachs banker, from a banker at another Wall Street firm, and from someone in ''new media,'' said Darren Sukenik, the listing broker and a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
 The banker from the other Wall Street firm prevailed.
 ''It's like this flight to sanity,'' Mr. Sukenik said. People in finance aren't using their bonus money to buy ''a red Ferrari or two weeks in St. Barts,'' he explained. ''Now they're using their bonuses to enter smart, sound real estate purchases.'' 
 Given the outrage in some quarters over bonuses, house-hunting recipients are both discreet and reluctant to be interviewed. 
 ''More important these days than ever before is anonymity, doing it under the radar,'' said Tim Davis, a senior managing director at the Corcoran Group, who has been selling real estate in the Hamptons for 30 years. Most Wall Street buyers, he said, are ''staying away from high-profile properties, saying, 'I don't want to be seen as buying X.' ''
 Stephen Seremetis, 37, an executive director of investments at Oppenheimer & Company, is in contract to buy a 2,994-square-foot loft in a new Jersey City development called Mercury Lofts at the Beacon. The space has a 60-foot living room, 20 windows and, he says, ''phenomenal views'' of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline. (Amenities in the complex include a Bloomberg box, a clear sign that the place is catering to the Wall Street set.) 
 Mr. Seremetis said he was content with his bonus this year, but he stressed that it was not his only reason for buying. Instead, he said, after a year of searching in Manhattan, New Jersey and Long Island City, he became convinced that prices had fallen as low as they were going to go. 
 ''It's more the value now,'' he said. ''Real estate has bottomed out, and it's time to step in.'' 
 Mr. Seremetis paid under $1 million, he said, for a half floor of space -- a bargain by Manhattan standards.
 Traffic is up markedly at open houses all over the city for apartments with asking prices over $1 million, and buyers who work in finance account for 40 to 75 percent of the crowd. More than 100 people turned out for an open house for a two-bedroom in the Village a couple of weeks ago. The elevator broke, but people took the stairs without complaining. 
 Last Sunday, a frigid winter day, Kathryn Higgins, an associate broker at DJK Residential, accompanied clients to an open house at a prewar co-op in the East 80s. So many people showed up, she said, that ''for the first time in two years, I had to wait in the lobby. My mouth was hanging open.''
 Although reports of large bonus pools at a number of firms have been widespread, some employees have yet to hear their personal ''number.'' That will happen over the next several weeks. 
 Karin Posvar-Picket, a senior vice president at Corcoran, recently reached a deal on a four-bedroom condo for more than $4 million at the Georgica on the Upper East Side. But, she said, the buyer ''is waiting for his bonus to hit'' before he proceeds with the closing. 
 One of her colleagues, Ms. Breitenbach in the Hamptons, had an offer on a property from a Wall Street buyer; the owner responded with a counteroffer. A day went by, but she heard nothing from the bidder. Ms. Breitenbach called his broker to find out what was going on. The answer: The buyer's bonus was to be paid in stock, and he had to see how much he could borrow on it before he could raise his offer.
 Wise bankers know that it's best not to put the cart before the horse even when a fat payout is anticipated. Adrienne Albert, the chief executive of the Marketing Directors, a marketing and sales agent of residential real estate, said her firm lost a bonus-inspired sale at the Crystal Point luxury development on the Jersey City waterfront. The buyer, who had already signed a contract, backed out when she learned that her bonus would be smaller than she had hoped.
 ''It was heartbreaking for us,'' Ms. Albert said.
 But, behemoth bonus, so-so bonus orno bonus at all, buyers appear to be stirring from their fear and torpor. Take the recent bidding on a one-bedroom condo with a terrace on East Ninth Street. 
 The property was first listed in June 2009. ''We were holding open houses diligently every other week,'' said the broker, Tristan Harper, a senior vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman. But the traffic was almost nonexistent. ''Zero to five parties, max,'' Mr. Harper said. The seller took the property off the market for the December holidays, then put it back on in early January in hopes of benefiting from a bonus bounce. At the first open house, 18 parties showed up, 30 to 40 percent of them from Wall Street. Mr. Harper was stunned. 
 Within a day he had an offer. It was under the asking price of $1.049 million, but the owner was able to negotiate for a little more.
 While the place was in contract, the seller received a significantly better offer -- above the asking price -- from two men. One of them worked on Wall Street.
 Then the original bidder matched that offer with all cash. In the meantime, a third offer came in, but the specter arose of all three bidders' fleeing if a bidding war ensued, so the seller never really entertained it. The first bidder won, at a price slightly over asking. 
 ''It was like the good times again,'' Mr. Harper said.

HEADLINE: After the High Jumps, Empty Shells

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- If you build it, he will come,'' Ray Kinsella, the farmer in the 1989 film ''Field of Dreams,''hears, mystically, as he walks through his cornfield. So at seemingly ruinous cost, he razes the cornfield and builds a ball field, and is rewarded with an endless stream of ticket buyers stretching to the rural Iowa horizon.
 In 2008, the Chinese built a ball field -- boy, what a ball field -- known worldwide for its lattice-like architecture as the Bird's Nest. Alas, after the 2008 Olympics, the ticket buyers haven't come. Right now, the Bird's Nest serves as a winter amusement park known as the Happy Ice and Snow Season. In April, a promoter may stage a celebrity rock concert to ''establish China as a world leader for global peace and a healthier planet.'' Or not. 
 After that, the government says it may build a shopping center there.
 The accompanying photographs, shot at locales for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, succinctly depict the loneliness of where the long-distance runner once strode. In a week when the United States contemplates how long its future will be spent deep in debt, they also hint at how much its greatest creditor is pinning its own hopes of building wealth on dreams.
 Two summers ago, China's Olympic extravaganza was recognized worldwide, and especially here, as a barely disguised metaphor for this nation's rise to worldwide importance. Eighteen months later, China is more important than its leaders could have imagined.
 But Beijing's famous Water Cube has hoofed its way from Olympic stadium to light-show concert hall to stage for a Russian performance of ''Swan Lake.''Its latest incarnation is as an indoor water park.
 In the year after the Olympics, the iconic 91,000-seat Bird's Nest hosted a Jackie Chan concert, an Italian soccer match, an opera and a presentation of Chinese singing standards. But the local soccer team declined a deal to make it their home field, and the only tenants now are tourists who pay $7 to visit the souvenir shop.
 By most accounts, the vendors hawking trinkets outside the stadium outnumber the foreigners who go there to gawk.
 Outsiders may find this wasteful. After all, Atlanta's Olympic stadium became a baseball park, and Calgary's Saddledome a civic fixture.
 Then again, the Olympics seem to bring out profligacy in even buttoned-down governments. Consider Athens, where 21 of the 22 stadiums erected for the 2004 Olympics were reported last year to be unoccupied. The $14.4 billion cost of that party is being cited by some as a source of Greece's potentially destabilizing fiscal troubles.
 If China is different -- and China is -- it is because fiscal worries on the diminutive scale of Athens hardly register on Beijing's blotter. Overbuilding is not a prime concern. Indeed, some might call it an economic strategy.
 This is a nation of spanking new office towers and hotels and luxury apartment complexes, many built on spec, many financed with state-subsidized loans, or on state-subsidized property, or with low-cost steel from mills built with state subsidies. Many are more empty than full.
 According to Colliers International, a real estate firm, Beijing's central business district offices will stand roughly 38 percent vacant this year. That's 12 points higher than the figure for San Bernardino, Calif., which the advisory firm REIS says was the worst major office market in America in the last quarter of 2009.
 Yet what seems awful in San Bernardino is the norm in effervescent Beijing. Real estate speculation here is rampant, many experts agree that housing and finance are riding bubbles, and everyone expects a big reckoning somewhere -- a year? two? -- down the line. But there was a reckoning after the Asia panic in 1999, and another reckoning in 2004, and both times the government bailed out the big state-owned banks, and the boom went on.
 Indeed, the government forgave the Agricultural Bank of China $120 billion in sour loans just last October without a peep of public protest.
 If you build it, the feeling is, they will come. Eventually, in a nation this large, someone will fill the convention center and the water park. And if not, well, build it anyway. Building creates jobs, and feeds prestige, and pumps up the GDP. Here in the nation that is too big to fail, as long as the bad loans don't overwhelm the good, the waste is tolerable.
 ''That, to me, is the essence of the Chinese strategy,'' Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and a former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division, said in a recent telephone interview. ''Just keep the machine going fast enough.''

HEADLINE: Rolling Out the Yoga Mat

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
LIKE Wi-Fi, on-demand movies and fitness centers, yoga is becoming an amenity many hotels and resorts just can't do without.
 Long popular at spas and retreat centers, yoga classes have been spreading to mainstream hotels, resorts and tour operators over the last several years. As the ancient stretching and meditation practice gained popularity, the travel industry began seeing dollar signs in sun salutations. Soon, yoga classes were showing up on the on-demand channels in Hyatts and Marriotts, and at the Kimpton hotel chain mats and straps were available to guests who asked. Spas and resorts began to tweak their yoga programs by hosting weeklong retreats with yoga masters like Rodney Yee and Colleen Saidman, who attracted a cultlike following. 
 Now, with yoga becoming so mainstream, properties from chain hotels to bed-and-breakfasts are looking for new ways to incorporate it into their programs to pique guests' interest and reach their wallets. 
 ''Yoga is becoming a must-have amenity,'' on the order of Internet access, said Chekitan S. Dev, a professor of marketing at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. ''Guests want to be able to stress out and go on the Internet and check e-mail, and then take five minutes and do yoga. It's the yin and the yang of travel.'' 
 Fairmont Hotels and Resorts is hiring a yogi to work with the brand to develop signature classes for its Willow Stream Spas. The Parker Palm Springs in California built an open-air yoga studio as part of its recently renovated spa, adding to other spaces used for yoga classes throughout the property. The Savannah House in Himrod, N.Y., in the Finger Lakes region started Wine and Yoga Getaway weekends in October that include visits to wineries, and yoga classes. 
 Dave Romanelli, co-owner of a chain of Arizona yoga studios, who is known for his popular yoga-and-chocolate and yoga-and-wine retreats, is introducing Yoga for Foodies. After an hour of flowing yoga poses, he said, a chef guides participants through a tasting, reminding them that ''life is short and we best slow down and savor it.'' 
 The InterContinental Montelucia Resort & Spa in Scottsdale, Ariz., which contracted Mr. Romanelli's company to teach daily classes at the resort in September, is hosting a four-day Chocolate Sabbatical this month. 
 There's also something to be said for novelty. ''We're a short-attention-span society,'' said Kristen Ulmer, founder of Ski to Live, which focuses on the mind-body connection of snow sports, including daily yoga. ''Just the yoga isn't enough to keep us entertained or maybe not even enough of a draw in and of itself.'' Her program is offered at several ski resorts, including Alta Ski Area in Utah April 1 to 4.
 Customers say such retreats are appealing because they combine a familiar routine with something new. Barb Harwell, who owns part of a small manufacturing company in Littleton, Colo., already practices yoga but wanted to improve her skiing this year. So when she heard the Osprey at Beaver Creek was offering a ReTreat Yourself getaway -- combining yoga, skiing and life coaching sessions -- she signed up. ''If it was just yoga, I might have thought, 'That's interesting,' but might not have signed up for the whole package,'' she said. 
 Combo yoga is an easy way for resorts to set themselves apart from the competition. The Four Seasons Maldives at Landaa Giraavaru, for example, offers Aqua Yoga in the resort's saltwater pool. In April, the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa in California will offer Ai Chi/Water Yoga classes in its geothermal mineral pool by combining yoga with Ai Chi, a tai chi-based exercise performed in water. And in March, the Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello in Quebec will offer a Laughter Yoga class, which combines laughter exercises and gentle yoga breathing with the aim of improving happiness.
 Still, more traditional yoga offerings continue to be a draw for hotels and tour operators alike, as nutrition and wellness become a larger part of the social fabric of the United States. ''More people are worried about their health and well-being,'' said Professor Dev of Cornell. Baby boomers, in particular, he said, are ''looking at what's happening not just outside of their body but at what's happening inside.'' 
 Hotels typically don't track yoga as a separate revenue stream. Rather it's often lumped into spa services. In luxury hotels, for example, yoga classes are increasingly being offered through the spa, often for a fee. ''To have a spa can mean 5 to 10 percent incremental occupied rooms and an even greater amount of incremental revenue as those guests tend to spend more than the average guest,'' said Bjorn Hanson, a hospitality professor at New York University.
 Nearly 7 percent of Americans, or 15.8 million people, practice yoga, according to a 2008 study by the magazine Yoga Journal. While that's down from 16.5 million in 2004, spending has continued to grow as devotees increasingly view yoga as a lifestyle choice rather than a fad and incorporate it into their fitness or wellness routines. Americans spend $5.7 billion a year on yoga classes and products, including vacations, nearly double what was spent in 2004, according to Yoga Journal.
 ''We are continuing to see strong interest in the yoga component, even through the bad economy,'' said Nancy Mertz, co-owner of Sea Kayak Adventures in Loreto on the Baja Peninsula. Sea Kayak has a $1,095 Yoga, Whales and Kayaks tour, in which each day begins with yoga on the beach, followed by whale-watching and kayaking outings with naturalist guides. The outfit, which started with one yoga and kayak trip with 13 guests in 2006, is now up to three trips a year, one of which is already sold out for 2010. 
 Whatever the form, however, yoga seems to be here to stay. ''We wouldn't build a spa or gym today without planning a space for an area where you can do yoga,'' said Christopher W. Norton, chairman of Four Seasons' Global Spa Task Force. ''It's a very important component.'' 
 Part of its staying power may have to do with its low overhead. ''I'd say there's a demand for yoga,'' said Niki Leondakis, chief operating officer at Kimpton Hotels. ''It's also something that's operationally easy to offer, relatively speaking. ''It doesn't require expensive gear or lots of space. The beauty is in its simplicity.'' 
 IF YOU GO
 Here are some hybrid programs involving yoga created by hotels and resorts to attract guests.
 Yoga and Wine Getaway Weekend at the Savannah House Inn, Himrod, N.Y. From $200 for the two-night stay (savannahhousevacation.com). 
 Ski to Live: Yoga and Skiing at Alta Ski Area, Utah. The four-day camp is $510 (kristenulmer.com/programs/ski-to-live).
 Yoga & Horses at Chezacut Wilderness Adventures, Redstone, British Columbia. The five-day retreat is $1,799 (chezacutwildernessadventures.com).

HEADLINE: Terrorism and the Pocketbook

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
SHORTLY after Sept. 11, 2001, a soon-to-be familiar figure appeared in the news media. He was a young Muslim who wanted nothing more than to strap on a belt laden with explosives and blow himself up in an area crowded with infidels. He thought his reward would be eternity in paradise with 72 virgins.
 But was he truly the face of Islamic terrorism? Eli Berman, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, says otherwise in ''Radical, Religious, and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism'' (M.I.T. Press, 300 pages). 
 ''The pious Jihadist, programmed with an ideology of hate to be a human guided missile, or dreaming of virgins in heaven, makes for compelling news broadcasts and emotional sound bites, but in concept does not stand up to scrutiny,'' he says.
 Professor Berman has written an engaging book that brings new insight to an extremely polarizing subject. He argues that many terrorists are actually more rational than we might like to think. And that, of course, is a chilling notion. 
 The author is neither a pacifist nor an apologist for terrorists. He says, however, that if we stop looking at them as cartoon characters, we may do a better job of deterring them. In his view, we need to understand the economic forces that govern their behavior. 
 Professor Berman says that some of the most effective and resilient groups with terrorist links are in some ways economic clubs, run by ''radical altruists.'' He puts Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban (the United States has tied all three to terrorism) in this category. Some of these militant soldiers of Islam may sometimes commit atrocities. But Professor Berman contends that they genuinely want to help their members. They raise money from foreign governments -- or, in the case of the Taliban, by selling opium -- and provide social services and jobs to adherents.
 The author notes that in South Lebanon, Hezbollah operates two private hospitals and a number of schools. It collects garbage, provides water and even manages an electricity grid. He says the Taliban operate 13 ''guerilla law courts'' in Afghanistan where locals can have disputes resolved. 
 Granted, the Taliban's underground judicial system may not be as expensive to operate as a hospital or a garbage pickup service, but it has the same effect of forging a tighter bond of between the operation and its constituents.
 However, Professor Berman writes, radical Islamic groups extract sacrifices from their members that have economic consequences. Families are encouraged to have lots of children, and the women are less likely to get jobs and have money to spend.
 Professor Berman says that these organizations also prefer that their members send their children to Islamic schools, whose graduates are less likely to obtain jobs that pay them enough money to explore the market and its temptations. Indeed, he says, these are some of the ways that radical believers ensure that their followers remain loyal.
 Now there have been many so-called terrorist groups. But most of them don't last because the authorities find someone who will give them information, which short-circuits the activities of the groups. 
 Professor Berman points out that Israeli security forces had little trouble shutting down the Jewish Underground, a less tightly organized group linked to terrorist acts, because its members were more willing to become informants than many of their Islamic peers. Al Qaeda does not offer social services, he says, and it has had more trouble historically with disloyal members.
 So what does Professor Berman think should be done to put terrorists out of business? He says we need to do more to stop their revenue streams. He recommends that we discourage gulf states from contributing money to Hamas and cut off the Taliban's inflows of cash from illegal activities.
 In Professor Berman's opinion, the United States needs to compete by offering the same kind of social services in Iraq and Afghanistan, though he concedes that terrorist groups will do everything to stop such efforts. He says aid providers must be protected -- and he concedes that this will be expensive. But he points out that we are already spending billions of dollars on domestic security. 
 ''In the long run,'' Professor Berman writes, ''those constructive approaches may well be cost-effective for the United States and other developed countries that are subject to international terrorism, because they are potentially sustainable.'' In other words, they could be good investments.
 Professor Berman is shrewd enough not to repeat the left-wing fallacy that terrorism itself is a product of economic deprivation. He seems reluctant, however, to explore why Islam is such a breeding ground for these practices. 
 He says the rise of militant Islam is just another wave of religious extremism, the likes of which have occurred throughout history. As he points out, the peace-loving Mennonites belong to a branch of Christianity that was once considered radical and dangerous.
 Then again, today's terrorists may soon get their hands on a nuclear device. Would Mennonites of old have detonated it? We don't know. But Professor Berman's ''radical altruists'' might.

HEADLINE: Letters: New Demand for Adjunct Professors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Back to School, as an Adjunct'' (The Search, Jan. 31) resonated with me, though I had a different constituency in mind. 
 In addition to providing a stopgap experience and resume builder for the unemployed and underemployed, adjunct college teaching is particularly relevant to the baby-boom generation by providing an ideal encore career. This is especially true for online teaching.
 Online education has experienced explosive growth, is incalculably convenient for both student and instructor, and mitigates the fear of in-person, classroom presentations that afflict many highly experienced, working professionals. Teaching online allows you to share your expertise and to be a mentor to the next generation -- wherever you happen to be. Marvin Weinbaum
 San Francisco, Feb. 1
 The writer is dean of the CyberCampus at Golden Gate University.
 To the Editor:
 Many of us have dedicated nearly a decade of training toward the profession of college teaching, only to face permanent economic insecurity and deplorable working conditions.
 Elimination of tenure-track positions began long before the recent economic downturn. Both aspiring and tenured professors are alarmed at how the ranks of unprotected, underpaid adjuncts have grown over the past two decades. That change has also been an effective way to consolidate power at universities within the administrative class, and to alter the fundamental nature of college education.
 The American university has long positioned itself as a place where the twin goals of research and teaching are brought together to promote advancement of thought. This model has largely explained why the best students worldwide covet degrees, particularly graduate degrees, from American institutions. The question we should be asking is what the casualization of the academic labor market means for our ability to continue as a leader of ideas. Alicia Gibson
 Hiroshima, Japan, Jan. 31
 The writer, a doctoral candidate in comparative literature at the University of Minnesota, is a research fellow at the Hiroshima Peace Institute.
 To the Editor:
 Having hired many adjunct instructors in the sciences, I have observed how experienced professionals can not only enrich student learning but can also foster academic-industrial research collaboration with faculty. 
 With diminishing resources supporting universities, and contraction of basic research in private industry, an unexpected benefit of this recession could be symbiosis between the two sectors. 
 Jeffrey H. Toney, Ph.D.
 Union, N.J., Feb. 1

HEADLINE: When Parks Must Rely On Private Money

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
A majestic staircase of granite rises some 30 feet above the Brooklyn edge of the East River, revealing a panorama that sweeps from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to Midtown Manhattan. A salt marsh lined in limestone offers a contemplative look at the river as ecosystem. Along paths winding up manufactured hills and ridges are hundreds of trees that outline velvety fields of green.
 This is Brooklyn Bridge Park, perched atop a ribbon of piers, and already hailed for its design and scope. But the park is taking shape only in fits and starts, and even opening the small part that is complete has been delayed until spring as the city and state hash out questions of money and control. 
 Despite 20 years of planning, work has barely begun on the bulk of the project. The $350 million construction budget is still short $125 million, and no one is sure who will come up with the $16 million needed each year for operations and maintenance. 
 Like the other important, expensive New York City green spaces built in recent years -- Hudson River Park and the High Line -- this one is arriving piecemeal as it awaits fresh infusions of money. And like the others, this park faces an uncertain future as the recession and resistance to its source of financing -- in this case, luxury apartments -- threaten its ability to move forward. 
 The struggle to pay for Brooklyn Bridge Park echoes similar problems around the country in creating urban parkland in a postindustrial age when open space must often be carved, at great cost, from derelict manufacturing zones, military installations or rail yards. Governments no longer have the fiscal or political muscle to finance the projects alone, and the involvement of private donors or commercial ventures has led to public battles.
 The days of grand development in the style of Frederick Law Olmsted and Robert Moses, whose parks and playgrounds were built and maintained by the government for decades, have given way to an era of private-public partnerships and pay-as-you-go. 
 ''There is this accelerating notion that not just parks but many aspects of the public realm have to be self-financing,'' said Michael Sorkin, director of the graduate program in urban design at the City College of New York. ''The paradox is that it's always amounting to giving away some public good in order to realize some other public good.''
 The tradeoff has provoked fights in many cities. 
 Millennium Park in Chicago is a huge hit, but only after bruising battles as the price tag swelled to $475 million from $150 million. That money, critics said, would be better spent on public education and the poor, and there were concerns that the city was making public space corporate by taking $200 million from private donors whose names now adorn the park. 
 In San Francisco, a fierce dispute ensued during the redevelopment of the Presidio, which started in the mid-1990s. Originally envisioned as a campus for nonprofit organizations, the park has become a more conventional entertainment zone, with restaurants, housing and a Disney museum.
 In New York, the Bloomberg administration's insistence that new developments include open space has fostered a boom in parks: the city has added more than 500 acres of parkland since 2002, with thousands more to come, including large-scale projects like Governors Island and Fresh Kills. But it is unclear who is to pay for all these new parks, many of which are on waterfront sites, making them much more expensive to maintain than those inland. 
 Two of three sections of the High Line, an abandoned elevated rail bed that was transformed into a linear park, cost about $152 million to build. Now, the private conservancy that developed the park with the city is scrambling to devise an income stream to cover the expected $3.5 million to $4.5 million annual cost of maintaining its jewel-box appeal. A proposal to assess a fee on nearby property owners foundered after business owners and residents objected to paying for what they see as a tourist destination. Officials are now looking to increase concessions and to raise money for an endowment.
 Hudson River Park, a city and state collaboration, is about half complete after 30 years of fractious planning and $400 million spent; most of the remainder is due to open later this year. The park gets about half of its operating money from a parking garage on Pier 40, said Connie Fishman, president of the park's trust. The income is ''enough for now,'' she said, but will not be for the long term, especially since the pier is in need of repair. 
 There is potential for income at Pier 57 from creating a cultural hub and marketplace, but one elaborate plan fell through and a new proposal is still in negotiations.
 ''While the idea is that the park would generate funds to sustain itself, they put so many restrictions on what could be done in the park that it just doesn't work,'' said Douglas Durst, a real estate developer whose $330 million proposal for the pier was rejected in favor of a less expensive plan from Youngwoo & Associates.
 Brooklyn Bridge Park is using city and state money for construction, but officials plan to cover operations and maintenance with revenue from concessions and, more controversially, fees from housing developments built at its edges. A luxury complex, One Brooklyn Bridge Park, has been open since 2007, but some of its 441 condominiums remain empty, despite price cuts and rentals. Construction has not begun on a hotel and three other proposed housing developments near the park, with nearly 800 additional apartments.
 City officials say they are open to other ideas for financing operation and maintenance -- which is especially expensive because the 12,000 pilings supporting the piers are under constant attack from marine borers like shipworms and gribbles. But they say they have not seen any strategy with as much promise as housing.
 ''We came up with a novel way to fund the operation of the park,'' said Robert C. Lieber, the deputy mayor for economic development. ''The market today may not be as receptive to that idea as it was when it was conceptualized, but we're as optimistic as you can be that the markets will recover.''
 Community activists and elected officials who fear that developers could turn what should be a public amenity into a private backyard for wealthy homeowners have accelerated efforts to block more housing. Daniel L. Squadron, a first-term Democratic state senator who represents the area, has suggested that the city instead dedicate to the park any increased tax revenues from rezoned properties within four-tenths of a mile. 
 ''When you talk more broadly about parks,'' he said, ''I don't think we have figured out how to make them self-sustaining.''
 Worried that Albany's fiscal woes could stymie progress, city officials have stepped up efforts to take over the project, now overseen by the Empire State Development Corporation. The city would pay $55 million, allowing work to begin on Piers 2 and 3, including installing a covering to permit winter recreation. But it is unclear whether the governor and the Legislature will give up their signatures on an amenity that could prove popular with the public. Meanwhile, the park is coming into view, with benches and tree-lined paths atop Pier 1 at the foot of Old Fulton Street, and a 1.6-acre playground on Pier 6 near Atlantic Avenue. 
 Regina Myer, president of the park's development corporation, decided to open the park in phases, building as money became available. She said she was confident the real estate market would rebound and support the rest.
 ''We know that these sites will have incredible inherent value,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Oh-So Quick And It's Even Carbon-Free

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

LOS ANGELES
 A FEW blocks from the Tesla Motors dealership here is one of California's public charging stations for electric vehicles. But the Tesla Roadster, just the sort of vehicle that planners had in mind when the statewide network was conceived, cannot be charged there.
 ''It's an inductive charging system,'' Jeremy Snyder, general manager of the Tesla showroom, said of the facility. Translation: the inductive connector is not compatible with the Roadster, whose conductive system uses a plug with metal contacts to carry the electricity that recharges the battery.
 Dang. Another government program that didn't quite work as planned.
 Not to worry, the Roadster has a built-in battery charger, so all it needs is power from a readily available source like a standard household outlet. This gives owners flexibility in when and where they can recharge their cars. 
 Using the standard charging connector (15 amp capacity) plugged into a typical 120-volt outlet, the Roadster needs an hour of recharging for every five miles of driving. If you drive it 40 miles -- the typical daily use, according to research by the General Motors engineers developing the 2011 Chevrolet Volt -- you can replenish the battery pack in eight hours. If you top off overnight at off-peak electricity rates, the Roadster is cheaply and fully charged by morning.
 If you drive far enough to deplete the Roadster's battery pack, it can take up to 36 hours to recharge it using 120-volt household current, at a cost of about $5, according to Tesla. Refueling is quicker when a high-voltage circuit, typically used for appliances like electric clothes dryers, is available.
 ''Most owners tell us they use a 220-volt circuit,'' a Tesla spokeswoman, Rachel Konrad, said.
 Tesla sells a 40-amp universal mobile connector (about six hours for a recharge) for $1,500. A 70-amp home connector, which will top off the battery from empty in less than 4 hours, goes for $1,950.
 ''As many as 20 percent of our owners actually have installed solar recharging systems,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''One owner has even come up with a calculation of the Roadster's fuel economy on sunshine.''
 The Roadster's range on a full charge is 244 miles in the E.P.A.'s combined city-highway test, which precludes it from being a long-haul vacation car. I inquired about driving it the 280 or so miles from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.
 ''That is outside of its range,'' Ms. Konrad said.
 Because the Roadster's electronic controls are programmed to slow the car down as its battery pack gets closer to its minimum charge level, owners are unlikely to drive the car until it's last bit of juice is drained. One Roadster, however, did drive more than 300 miles on a single charge during last year's Global Green Challenge in Australia.
 But hypermilers, a breed of specialists who take pride in going the extra mile, usually get their best results at very low speeds. ''If you're willing to drive it around at 10 miles an hour, you might be able to go 500 miles with it,'' Ms. Konrad said.
 Because I only had a day in a bright orange two-seater, not the full week I normally take to evaluate a car, I had no chance (and little desire) to challenge that statement. More important, my one-day trial gave me no opportunity to test the Roadster's total range or check Tesla's claims for recharge times.
 Even my abbreviated drive took nearly two years to arrange; it often seemed as if Tesla was dodging me. Earlier test-drive offers from the company, contingent on having a chaperone ride along, were declined.
 The Roadster has turned into a celebrity since it became available a year and a half ago, and the 2010 model is more refined than the original Roadster. Tesla has addressed many of the most egregious complaints it received about the first Roadsters: crude interiors, annoying controls, anemic air-conditioning, squeaks and rattles, awful seats, a clattering ride and less range and power than many early adopters were hoping for.
 This summer, Tesla introduced an upgraded model, the Roadster Sport, with a price inflated by $19,500 over the base Roadster's $110,950 window sticker. Even at the price level of an Aston Martin, the Roadster Sport, I must admit, far exceeded my wary expectations. Is the age of the electric car at last dawning? It would seem so.
 The ride was still harsh in the Roadster Sport I tested, but the adjustable suspension with sport and comfort settings was a mild improvement. With its Lotus-derived wishbone suspension and low center of gravity -- not to mention the 992-pound lithium-ion battery pack over its rear wheels -- the Roadster Sport hugs the road like a go-kart.
 All Roadsters use an air-cooled A.C. induction motor rated at 215 kilowatts -- the equivalent of 288 horsepower -- but the Sport gets a boost to 295 pound-feet of torque over the regular Roadster's 273 pound-feet, making acceleration stronger from 20 m.p.h. to 50 m.p.h.
 The automatic transmission has a single speed. Tesla says that accelerating to 60 m.p.h. in this 2,723-pound dart takes less than 3.7 seconds; the top speed is electronically limited to 125 m.p.h.
 The Sport option also includes forged wheels and Yokohama ultrahigh-performance tires that provide a level of grip you'd need a racetrack to fully exploit.
 Brembo brakes will effectively stop the car, but the immediate regenerative braking when taking your foot off the accelerator is more than enough to whoa it down (to about 3 m.p.h.). The car can be driven at least 90 percent of the time with just your right foot.
 In the E.P.A. test cycle of 55 percent city driving and 45 percent highway, the Roadster delivered 244 miles on a ''tankful'' of juice; selecting among the Tesla's preprogrammed driving modes can extend or shorten that range. Abused all day on a racetrack, its range might dip to 135 miles, Ms. Konrad said. The federal mileage rating on my test car's window sticker was 29 kilowatt hours per 100 miles in town and a somewhat higher consumption of 32 on the highway.
 With the electronic controls in their default driving mode it didn't seem to matter how hard I hammered the accelerator pedal -- up hills and down, in hard cornering or jackrabbit starts -- the projected range stayed the same on the cockpit gauges. There is also a performance mode, but my favorite, valet mode, is known inside the company as the Ferris Bueller Mode, which means a would-be joyrider wouldn't get far before the vehicle would shut off.
 Though many improvements have been made since the car was introduced, the cockpit still feels chintzy. Even the addition of optional carbon fiber bits doesn't change that. Additional options like upgraded electronics and ''executive leather'' seats (still uncomfortable) pushed the as-tested price of my test car to $155,850. One could reasonably ask whether it makes sense for anyone to pay that much for a vehicle that is essentially based on a $50,000 Lotus Elise.
 The price is offset somewhat by federal tax credits of $7,500 (subject to the buyer's income) ; some states also exempt E.V.'s from sales tax and offer further rebates. In any case, the Tesla Roadster is one exotic sports car that doesn't come with a gas guzzler tax added on.
 Tesla still seems to be struggling to meet its annual production target of 1,000 units. Over all, more than 900 Roadsters had been delivered as of mid-November, Ms. Konrad said.
 Customers who have taken delivery seem to have an almost cultlike devotion to the cars, if owners' blogs are an indication. (The biggest owner complaints nowadays: dirty windshields. Why? If you never have to go to a gas station, your windshield doesn't get cleaned.)
 After all the missed deadlines to get the Roadster to this point, a certain amount of caution is probably warranted around Tesla's promises for its next offering, the Model S sedan. But the company did score a coup by hiring Franz von Holzhausen from Mazda to design the new car. (His portfolio of past work includes the Pontiac Solstice.) The Model S, due by 2012, is supposed to cost less than half as much as the base Roadster.
 Give Tesla Motors its due; despite many setbacks along the way, it ultimately delivered the Roadster -- though the car ended up over budget and far behind schedule, and many executives left the company under unhappy circumstances.
 Still, the Tesla Roadster works pretty much as promised. And, as such, it is worthy of a measure of acclaim as an automotive pioneer.

HEADLINE: Orphanages Of Haiti Offer Bleak Portrait

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 

 BODY:
The floors were concrete and the windows were broken.
 There was no electricity or running water. Lunch looked like watery grits. Beds were fashioned from sheets of cardboard. And the only toilet did not work.
 But the Foyer of Patience here is like hundreds of places that pass as orphanages for thousands of children in the poorest country in the hemisphere. Many are barely habitable, much less licensed. They have no means to provide real schooling or basic medical care, so children spend their days engaged in mindless activities, and many die from treatable illnesses.
 Haiti's child welfare system was broken before the earthquake struck. But as the quake shattered homes and drove hundreds of thousands of people into the streets, the number of children needing care grew exponentially. 
 Chronic problems -- like inadequate services, overwhelming poverty and shady orphanages -- have only intensified, while the authorities fear that some of the less scrupulous orphanages are taking advantage of the chaos to round up children in crisis and offer them for sale as servants and sex slaves. 
 But it took the arrest last weekend of 10 Americans caught trying to leave the country with 33 Haitian children to focus international attention on the issue. While there is no evidence that the Americans, who said they were trying to rescue children in the aftermath of the earthquake, intended any harm, the ease with which they drove into the capital and scooped up a busload of children without documents exposed vast gaps in the system's safeguards.
 ''This has called the world's attention because it is the first clear piece of evidence that our fears have come true,'' said Patricia Vargas, the regional coordinator for SOS Children's Villages, which provides services to abandoned children around the world. ''Our concern as an organization is how many other cases are out there that we are not aware of.''
 At the front lines of the system are the orphanages, which run the gamut from large, well-equipped institutions with international financing to one-room hovels in a slum where a single woman cares for abandoned children as best she can. 
 Most of the children in them, the authorities said, are not orphans, but children whose parents are unable to provide for them. To desperate parents, the orphanage is a godsend, a temporary solution to help a child survive a particularly tough economic stretch. Many orphanages offer regular family visiting hours and, when their situations improve, parents are allowed to take their children back home.
 But instead of protecting Haiti's most vulnerable population, some orphanages have become tools of exploitation, the authorities fear.
 ''There are many so-called orphanages that have opened in the last couple of years that are not really orphanages at all,'' said Frantz Thermilus, the chief of Haiti's National Judicial Police. ''They are fronts for criminal organizations that take advantage of people who are homeless and hungry. And with the earthquake they see an opportunity to strike in a big way.'' 
 There is no precise count of the number of orphanages in this country, the number of children living in them, or of the children who are victims of trafficking, although Unicef estimates that number in the tens of thousands per year. The authorities said thousands of those trafficked were sold as servants, known as restaveks, to well-to-do Haitian families. Others, officials say, are smuggled into the Dominican Republic to do domestic and agricultural work, often in appalling conditions.
 In recent years, the government has tried to crack down on trafficking, establishing special police units known as child protection brigades that monitor children leaving the airports or crossing borders. But a State Department report issued last year said the brigades did not pursue trafficking cases because there was no Haitian law against the practice. The government ''did shut down a number of unregistered orphanages whose residents were believed to be vulnerable to trafficking,'' the report said.
 And in the wake of the earthquake, the authorities suspended all adoptions pending a review of hundreds of applications already in the system.
 But Haitian authorities acknowledge that the fledgling efforts of a financially struggling government long plagued by corruption have proved little match for the highly organized, multimillion-dollar criminal networks. 
 Manuel Fontaine, a child protection specialist with Unicef, said his agency was also concerned that Haiti's inability to monitor orphanages and keep track of children moving in and out of them left them open to abuses.
 ''With the system already fragile before the quake, we knew something like this could happen,'' he said of the effort by the 10 Americans. ''We warned authorities here to be on the lookout.''
 It was unclear what the future holds for the 50 children crammed into two bedrooms at the Foyer of Patience, some of them scampering around in clothes that were either too big or too small, and others wearing no clothes at all.
 The director of the orphanage, Enoch Anequaire, said he opened the center five years ago but has had no time to get a license. He said he provided an education to the children, but there was not a single book, piece of paper or pencil in the house.
 He said he fed them three square meals. At noon, one recent day, several said that they had had nothing to eat. 
 Mr. Anequaire, whose own clothes were pressed and shoes polished, said he had been overwhelmed with new children since the earthquake. He pointed out five boys who arrived last Wednesday and said that an aunt had brought them in because their homes had collapsed, and that their mothers were unable to feed them.
 Some of the children, however, said Mr. Anequaire had come looking for them.
 ''He came to my house and told my mother he needed 10 more kids,'' said one of the boys, whose names were withheld from this article to protect them from retribution. 
 Mr. Anequaire denied this version of events.
 Across the street stands another orphanage, two-story compound called the Foyer of Zion, where more than 60 children live in airy, cheerfully decorated rooms. Still, on a recent visit, it was woefully understaffed and poorly equipped. Children in the nursery were kept in stacked wooden boxes rather than cribs.
 The director, Marjorie Mardy, said that the center was financed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that several members from the United States had rushed to Port-au-Prince after the earthquake to take home children who had been in the adoption process for more than two years.
 Most of the children, however, were in legal limbo, she said. Their parents had not given up custody, nor had they any clear plans for bringing the children home. Many children had been dropped off at the orphanage without any documents providing their names, ages or need for specialized care, which Ms. Mardy acknowledges she is unable to provide.
 There was a baby so frail and shriveled she was clearly sick, but Ms. Mardy said she had not been able to take her for tests. A toddler who seemed lethargic and unresponsive had been running a low-grade fever since arriving at the orphanage after the earthquake. But she had not been taken to a doctor.
 ''In Haiti, it's not like the United States where people have jobs and homes and security,'' Ms. Mardy said. ''And if people have no security, how can they give security to their children?
 ''We try to give them that security,'' she said. ''But at times like these, it's overwhelming.''
 The solution, say child protection advocates, lies as much in fixing families as fixing orphanages. 
 ''If we are going to really protect children, orphanages have to become a family's last resort,'' said Suzanna Tkalec, a human rights lawyer and child protection specialist at Catholic Relief Services, which is developing a program to provide social and economic support for the families of some 2,000 displaced children.
 ''Anything that recreates a family is a much better option.''
 Lomene Nerisier is a living example of what is possible. After her husband kicked her and their three children out of their house in La Mardelle, she begged an orphanage in the village to give the children to a family that might provide them a better life.
 The director, Gina Duncan, offered Ms. Nerisier a job instead. She received part of her salary in cash and the other part in materials to build her own house. Three years later, she not only takes care of her own children, but she also teaches preschool.
 Today she is proud of her accomplishment, but not naive about what sets her apart from the vast majority of mothers in this country.
 ''I am lucky,'' she said. ''So many women do not have jobs. They do not have land to grow food for their children. If their choice is to watch their children starve or give them away, they are going to give them away, and hope that they have put them in good hands.'' 
 Either way, the decision is heart-wrenching for parent and child. Stanley Vixamar, 10, cried through the night on his first night at the Foyer of Patience.
 ''I wanted to stay with my mother even though our house has fallen down,'' he said. ''I love her.''

HEADLINE: Sinatra Song Often Strikes Deadly Chord

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: GENERAL SANTOS, the Philippines 

 BODY:
After a day of barbering, Rodolfo Gregorio went to his neighborhood karaoke bar still smelling of talcum powder. Putting aside his glass of Red Horse Extra Strong beer, he grasped a microphone with a habitue's self-assuredness and briefly stilled the room with the Platters' ''My Prayer.''
 Next, he belted out crowd-pleasers by Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck. But Mr. Gregorio, 63, a witness to countless fistfights and occasional stabbings erupting from disputes over karaoke singing, did not dare choose one beloved classic: Frank Sinatra's version of ''My Way.''
 ''I used to like 'My Way,' but after all the trouble, I stopped singing it,'' he said. ''You can get killed.'' 
 The authorities do not know exactly how many people have been killed warbling ''My Way'' in karaoke bars over the years in the Philippines, or how many fatal fights it has fueled. But the news media have recorded at least half a dozen victims in the past decade and includes them in a subcategory of crime dubbed the ''My Way Killings.'' 
 The killings have produced urban legends about the song and left Filipinos groping for answers. Are the killings the natural byproduct of the country's culture of violence, drinking and machismo? Or is there something inherently sinister in the song?
 Whatever the reason, many karaoke bars have removed the song from their playbooks. And the country's many Sinatra lovers, like Mr. Gregorio here in this city in the southernmost Philippines, are practicing self-censorship out of perceived self-preservation. 
 Karaoke-related killings are not limited to the Philippines. In the past two years alone, a Malaysian man was fatally stabbed for hogging the microphone at a bar and a Thai man killed eight of his neighbors in a rage after they sang John Denver's ''Take Me Home, Country Roads.'' Karaoke-related assaults have also occurred in the United States, including at a Seattle bar where a woman punched a man for singing Coldplay's ''Yellow'' after criticizing his version. 
 Still, the odds of getting killed during karaoke may be higher in the Philippines, if only because of the ubiquity of the pastime. Social get-togethers invariably involve karaoke. Stand-alone karaoke machines can be found in the unlikeliest settings, including outdoors in rural areas where men can sometimes be seen singing early in the morning. And Filipinos, who pride themselves on their singing, may have a lower tolerance for bad singers.
 Indeed, most of the ''My Way'' killings have reportedly occurred after the singer sang out of tune, causing other patrons to laugh or jeer.
 ''The trouble with 'My Way,' '' said Mr. Gregorio, ''is that everyone knows it and everyone has an opinion.''
 Others, noting that other equally popular tunes have not provoked killings, point to the song itself. The lyrics, written by Paul Anka for Mr. Sinatra as an unapologetic summing up of his career, are about a tough guy who ''when there was doubt,'' simply ''ate it up and spit it out.'' Butch Albarracin, the owner of Center for Pop, a Manila-based singing school that has propelled the careers of many famous singers, was partial to what he called the ''existential explanation.''
 '' 'I did it my way' -- it's so arrogant,'' Mr. Albarracin said. ''The lyrics evoke feelings of pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you're somebody when you're really nobody. It covers up your failures. That's why it leads to fights.''
 Defenders of ''My Way'' say it is a victim of its own popularity. Because it is sung more often than most songs, the thinking goes, karaoke-related violence is more likely to occur while people are singing it. The real reasons behind the violence are breaches of karaoke etiquette, like hogging the microphone, laughing at someone's singing or choosing a song that has already been sung. 
 ''The Philippines is a very violent society, so karaoke only triggers what already exists here when certain social rules are broken,'' said Roland B. Tolentino, a pop culture expert at the University of the Philippines. But even he hedged, noting that the song's ''triumphalist'' nature might contribute to the violence.
 Some karaoke lovers are not taking chances, not even at family gatherings.
 In Manila, Alisa Gabby, 33, and her relatives invariably gather before a karaoke machine, but they banned ''My Way'' after an uncle, listening to a friend sing the song at a bar, became enraged at the laughter coming from the next table. The uncle, who was a police officer, pulled out his revolver, after which the customers at the next table quietly paid their bill and left.
 Awash in more than one million illegal guns, the Philippines has long suffered from all manner of violence, from the political to the private. Wary middle-class patrons gravitate to karaoke clubs with cubicles that isolate them from strangers.
 But in karaoke bars where one song costs 5 pesos, or a tenth of a dollar, strangers often rub shoulders, sometimes uneasily. A subset of karaoke bars with G.R.O.'s -- short for guest relations officers, a euphemism for female prostitutes -- often employ gay men, who are seen as neutral, to defuse the undercurrent of tension among the male patrons. Since the gay men are not considered rivals for the women's attention -- or rivals in singing, which karaoke machines score and rank -- they can use humor to forestall macho face-offs among the patrons.
 In one such bar in Quezon City, next to Manila, patrons sing karaoke at tables on the first floor and can accompany a G.R.O. upstairs. Fights often break out when customers at one table look at another table ''the wrong way,'' said Mark Lanada, 20, the manager.
 ''That's the biggest source of tension,'' Mr. Lanada said. ''That's why every place like this has a gay man like me.''
 Ordinary karaoke bars, like the Nelson Carenderia here, a single room with bare plywood walls, mandate that a singer give up the microphone after three consecutive songs.
 On one recent evening, at the table closest to the karaoke machine, Edwin Lancaderas, 62, crooned a Tagalog song, ''Fight Temptation'' -- about a married man forgoing an affair with a woman while taking delight in their ''stolen moments.'' His friend Dindo Auxlero, 42, took the mike next, bawling songs by the Scorpions and Dire Straits. Several empty bottles of Red Horse crowded their table.
 ''In the Philippines, life is difficult,'' said Mr. Auxlero, who repairs watches from a street kiosk, as he railed about government corruption and a weak economy that has driven so many Filipinos to work overseas, including his wife, who is a maid in Lebanon. ''But, you know, we have a saying: 'Don't worry about your problems. Let your problems worry about you.' ''
 The two men roared with laughter. 
 ''That's why we come here every night -- to clear the excesses from our heads,'' Mr. Lancaderas said, adding, however, that the two always adhered to karaoke etiquette and, of course, refrained from singing ''My Way.''
 ''Misunderstanding and jealousy,'' in his view, were behind the ''My Way'' killings. ''I just hope it doesn't happen here,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Art Of Being Santa Fe

BYLINE: By HENRY SHUKMAN. 
HENRY SHUKMAN is a frequent contributor to the Travel section. His latest book is ''Lost City'' (Vintage Contemporaries).

 BODY:
I CAN'T remember how or why it came to be dawn when I first saw Santa Fe from a bus window. It was my first time in New Mexico, the fulfillment of a long-held dream: to visit the land that had enflamed my imagination when as a teenager I'd read D. H. Lawrence's paeans to the state. 
 The desert slowly emerged out of a velvet blackness, became a watery blue, almost the blue of a swimming pool. Then just as we got to the top of the long climb of La Bajada Hill and the Sangre de Cristo mountains sprang into view, the wing of darkness over the earth withdrew, and the true daytime colors began to show, rusty-brown as a cougar's hide. Ahead, the gaunt lump of the mountains, receiving the first red blush on their faces. At their feet, the mingling of the lights of town with stars of sunlight winking from distant windows.
 It's still one of those approaches, those arrivals, that seems mythical, impossibly grand. The highway reaches away, straight at the mountains, like a long drawbridge into a castle. 
 Countless people have followed that archetypal ramp into a new life. Santa Fe still holds out a promise of renewal, of exactly what Lawrence was looking for when he came to this area: a place that could change not only one's external life but also one's inner, spiritual life. ''Touch the country,'' he said of New Mexico, ''and you will never be the same again.''
 What is Santa Fe? A place of healing, since the tuberculosis sufferers started coming over a century ago. A spiritual mini-mecca for a semi-godless age. A sumptuous adobe haven for a few super-rich. A land of hope for thousands of illegal immigrants. A hothouse of talent and IQ, with an extraordinary concentration of Ph.D.'s, and more artists than any American city its size. (According to one report, 39 percent of the city's economy is generated by the arts and culture.) On and on the list goes. It's a city of trade and exchange, of markets, built at the crossroads of the old Camino Real and the Santa Fe Trail. Wealthy people fly here from New York to buy their Asian rugs, and opera lovers flock here in summer for the justifiably world-famous open-air productions at the Santa Fe Opera.
 But perhaps the greatest draw is still the promise of a spiritual homeland. There are no fewer than four Zen centers, several Tibetan shrines, any number of New Age ''institutes,'' innumerable churches of all denominations, yoga centers, gurus, teachers, seers, prophets, Sufis, Sikhs, literally thousands of therapists -- body, mind, spirit and everything-in-between therapists. This is a city where the wounded come for healing, and seekers come to find.
 I've been coming to Santa Fe since 1991, and have lived there for the last five years. I've developed some predictable preconceptions -- there's the famous tricultural diversity, the celebrated adobe look, and so on. But I still don't really know it, even though it's not a big place. A city, like everything on this earth, is constantly changing. Gov. Bill Richardson recently said in an interview that today there's a new Santa Fe. Many would agree. But how do you measure such a thing? How do you find it? 
 As Santa Fe celebrates its 400th year of existence, a milestone that will be marked by a year's worth of events, I decided to let myself be led along a chain of links, and see where it ended up: a kind of treasure hunt, one clue leading to the next. Perhaps as I followed it, I'd even figure out how a British poet like myself ever wound up here. 
 I FIRST saw the tree a few weeks ago. If I hadn't been tipped off, I would have driven right past it. It's no more than 10 feet tall, and you could easily miss the fact that its leaves are made of green plastic bottles cut up to resemble bushy, brilliant foliage, and that its trunk is old tire treads laid out in long, somehow elegant strips. Not only that, it's in the form of a slender woman, fine and aquiline of feature, standing with her arms outstretched, like a cross between Mother Mary, a supermodel and the crucifix high above Rio.
 Three guys happened to be climbing into an old pickup nearby. Did they know anything about what the beautiful recycled tree was doing here, outside a community center in semi-central Santa Fe?
 One of the men, with a Stetson and bushy gray mustache, eyed me a second, then said: ''Some Brazilian guys from the Institute made it.'' He glanced up with a smile. ''Sure is pretty what they can do with a tire.''
 ''The Institute?''
 ''The Art Institute.''
 The day I visited the Santa Fe Art Institute to learn more about the tire tree, a troupe of Native American dancers from around the country, Dancing Earth, had gathered for three weeks of rehearsal. Dressed in elegant evening wear, looking like classical ballerinas at a cocktail party, they were mingling with well-wishers. They use dance to provide a bridge, Rulan Tangen, their leader explained, from the sacred native world of dance to the wider world.
 Diane Karp, the Institute's director, clearly loves the flow of all kinds of creativity that passes through her doors, such doors as there are. The main studios -- enormous, beautiful white chambers -- flow into one another, creating maximum opportunities for creative exchange. It was she who found two Brazilian street artists and managed to get them here. One of their projects was the tire tree. ''Isn't it great?'' Ms. Karp said. ''We brought these guys in from Sao Paulo. They've done murals there in the favelas telling the history of the shanties. They were keen to come, so they're busy working around town, creating graffiti art and recycled art.''
 Guerrilla artists?
 ''Pretty much. We don't want to turn our kids off art, by trying to bring our ideas to them. It works better the other way round.''
 A few streets away, there was another art gathering going on this evening. Swing a tortilla in Santa Fe and you'll hit an artist. (One reason for this is a living-wage ordinance Mayor David Coss introduced when he was on the city council, which helps artists to support themselves with day jobs.) 
 Meow Wolf is a young art collective -- a pack, as they call themselves. At their last show they wheeled an old Volkswagen into their warehouse space and fell on it. In three hours straight they tore the vehicle to pieces, and made a stop-motion video of the process.
 Tonight was ''Throwdown'' night. One of the artists put out boards and art supplies and piles of ''recycled art materials'' -- a k a junk -- and invited members of the pack to assemble pieces on the boards any way they liked. The resulting contained chaoses were surprisingly beautiful. A doll sprouts wings made of shards of wood from a broken palette, looking like a winged cherub. A shoe gets wrapped in rope. Lots of paint is used. And insulating foam. And glue. And wire. And all kinds of everything.
 A number of people were drifting through, congregating around the one big old cylindrical gas heater in the middle of the main room. ''Yeah,'' said one of the crew. ''We were bombed. We used to have an old wood-burning stove but someone stole it.''
 Is Santa Fe a congenial place to do the art they do?
 ''Totally,'' said Quinn Tincher, alpha voice of the pack. ''We're the only place doing this, so people are very supportive. They donate stuff all the time. Just leave it for us in the parking lot. They know we'll use it.''
 Matt King, another member, added: ''And if anyone is into our kind of aesthetic, they tend to join us. People are always coming through town. They find us.''
 This summer, to coincide with the latest Biennial at SITE Santa Fe (which promises to be a stunning assembly of animated artwork), Meow Wolf has been invited by the Linda Durham Gallery, a pillar of the art scene for 30 years, to recreate their 16-foot Dome, a geodesic frame completely jammed with old household goods -- armchairs, tables, TVs, ovens, everything -- suspended in a congealed mass.
 SOONER or later, everything new becomes old. But wait long enough, and the old becomes new again. Nearly a century ago, the elders of Santa Fe devised a way to attract tourists: their building code, based on the ancient pueblo adobe style. America's only ancient mud city began to spread into the 20th century.
 What has set Santa Fe apart from all other American cities is not that it is old but the foresight of the decision to make it look old. Santa Fe is a kind of hoax, one that has been so successful, economically, architecturally and culturally, that the reality of its success has overwhelmed the pretense of its origins. It doesn't matter how it came about; it is the adobe gem we see today.
 The same foresight that put Santa Fe on the map for ''cultural tourism'' in the 1920s continues to keep Santa Fe ahead of the game. Rather than letting the city become a worn-out one-trick pony, initiatives of the past few years to transform it have come to fruition.
 One architect of these is Governor Richardson. Thanks to statewide tax breaks, Santa Fe now has a thriving movie industry, with a studio being built just outside town and an in-state crew base of thousands. A new $400 million railway, the Rail Runner, connects Santa Fe with Albuquerque. The city has a whole new downtown section, both the new Railyard and the Triangle District, designed with a neo-industrial look a far cry from the traditional adobe. There's the magnificent New Mexico History Museum, opened last May, a light-filled multilevel edifice that also incorporates the nation's oldest continually occupied municipal building, the Palace of the Governors. 
 Santa Fe still has an extraordinary concentration of artists and scientists, many of the latter based at the Santa Fe Institute; what is different today is that the scientists and artists are actually beginning to collaborate, in complexity experiments that are among the most progressive happening anywhere on the planet. And it is quietly fostering its own green revolution.
 ''Yes, there's a new Santa Fe,'' the governor said when I visited him in his splendid, hushed third-floor office in the round Senate Building (high, for low-rise Santa Fe). ''But it's one founded on our past. Thanks to the Historic Preservation Board, we've done a tremendous job of conserving our history. And now we're moving into new territory. Above all, we're becoming connected.''
 Alfonz Viszolay operates from an adobe complex on a frontage road south of Santa Fe. In his gravel yard between two large adobe buildings, a few old trucks stand on blocks amid high-tech-looking machines for pollution control, with elaborate tangles of pipes, shining cylinders, lights, dials and switches. There are sculptures made of scrap iron, and newly planted trees. The impression is like a grand Hispanic ranch crossed with a Mad Max pit stop.
 With his bushy white mustache and a mischievous twinkle in the eye, Mr. Viszolay, a native of Hungary, has been something of a green pioneer for four decades. ''I was getting aware the environment has to be do something,'' he said in his charming, accented Hunglish.
 Mr. Viszolay's current baby is algae. With Paul Laur, he uses wastewater to feed algae, pumping carbon dioxide emissions through them to make them grow faster, then harvesting them for biofuel.
 ''Look at this,'' he said, pulling a tarpaulin aside to reveal a gleaming blue race car in a hangarlike wing of his complex. ''It runs on bio-ethanol and alcohol. And it's fast.'' He grinned. ''We show them what these fuels can do.''
 In this new era of sustainability, Mr. Viszolay says he has found Santa Fe to be an ideal place to operate. ''There are so many Ph.D.'s here,'' he said. ''And people don't worry about Armani suits. You have to be real. There are some of the most brilliant people in the world right here, but you'd never believe it if you saw them. Dirty clothes, old jeans.''
 Over the years he has brought in Navajo dancers to bless his projects -- a strange but happy conjunction of science and the old ways. ''The Indian nation was always clean and responsible,'' Mr. Viszolay said. ''They don't make mess like modern America.'' Natives and progressives: just what the new Santa Fe is all about. 
 On a very cold New Year's morning, I met up with two young artists from Santa Clara Pueblo outside their favorite hangout, the Aztec Cafe. The place was closed for the holiday, so we went instead to nearby Cafe Dominic for Earl Grey tea. 
 Is Santa Fe good for young artists?
 ''There's high art here, international art, and rich people to buy it,'' said Rose Bean Simpson, who has a scholarship to Rhode Island School of Design. ''It could be frustrating if you're a young artist with a different aesthetic.''
 ''But that's changing,'' Eliza Naranjo-Morse broke in. ''Native art used to be about making iconic gifts for people to take home, and that still exists. But when our parents were younger, people began creating genuine contemporary art, too.''
 A major engine behind that evolution has been the Institute for American Indian Arts, a premier national institution for contemporary native art. As the marker of 400 years of European presence arrives, the institute has opened three buildings on its campus south of town, doubling its size and enrollment. 
 Tremendous changes are happening in the nearby Indian pueblos, too. Most conspicuously, Pojoaque Pueblo a few miles north of town has opened perhaps the biggest resort in the state, Buffalo Thunder. With a spa, golf course, pools, tennis courts and casinos, the development is crammed full of pueblo art. It's not only a resort but almost a museum. 
 The inspiration behind it is Pojoaque Governor George Rivera, a talented artist who trained in California and France, as well as at the institute. He took me for a glide around the pueblo's little empire in his gleaming white BMW. Many of the developments were not only initiated by Mr. Rivera but even designed by him. For example, the new adobe church with a monolithic red stone campanile and six-arch Romanesque portal.
 ''You're an architect, too?'' I asked him.
 ''I'm a designer,'' he said. ''I'm an artist. And we have our own construction company, so if we don't like something, we can pull it down and do it again.''
 A century ago, with American development going into hyperdrive, it might have seemed impossible that Santa Fe, a little city 10 miles from the railroad, could both grow and preserve its character. Yet it happened. Today that city is ''at a cusp moment,'' said Zane Fischer, cultural columnist of The Santa Fe Reporter, an alternative weekly. ''The preservation has happened, and we all have to be eternally grateful to the folks who made it happen. But now we can also pull together all the incredible resources of this city -- the centuries of green thinking, the science, the artists, the writers.''
 One place attempting to do just that is the new Santa Fe Complex, near the Railyard, an experimental space devoted to collaboration among the arts, science and technology. All the furniture in the large cement-floored main hall is on wheels. ''It's all about fluidity, flow,'' said Ed Angel, the complex's president. ''We bring creative people together, but we're not here to achieve certain results.''
 Like an exercise in complexity science?
 ''Exactly. We don't want to know the outcome. We're here to see what happens, that's all.''
 Clearly, much has happened already. 
 And as for that oddly dislocated British poet who was drawn here, along with thousands of other Europeans? They say Santa Fe has a will of its own. If the town wants you, it will get you and keep you; if not it will eject you. We're obviously all just unwitting elements in a complexity experiment, one whose outcome is not the point, which we never even knew we were part of. And it's only just beginning.
 IF YOU GO
 Santa Fe became the capital of the New Mexico province in 1610, making it the first state capital in the United States to celebrate its quatercentenary. Whether the arrival of armed invaders who ''settled'' land that had been inhabited for centuries -- and put those who objected to the sword -- is something to celebrate or mourn is an open question. (Perhaps New Mexico, with its many pueblos, will one day follow South Dakota in changing Columbus Day to Native American Day.) But somehow the Europeans and Indians have muddled through, and the Royal City of the Holy Faith of Saint Francis of Assisi has become the beloved adobe wonder that it is. 
 In addition to various events the city is planning, many new developments have recently been completed. The Rail Runner Express (nmrailrunner.com), which runs from Belen, south of Albuquerque, now arrives at the Santa Fe Depot several times a day. After many years of planning, building and renovation, the Railyard (railyardsantafe.com), with its complex of shops and farmers' market (open Tuesdays and Saturdays during warm-weather months and Saturdays the rest of the year), opened in September 2008. Thousands of new students within the state are now studying for different areas of the burgeoning film industry. Green businesses are growing. 
 On the culinary front, in spite of the recession, new restaurants have opened, most notably a proliferation of chocolateries, and a farm-to-table initiative is thriving. The city is small enough, the region fertile enough, to revive a kind of neo-medieval connection between city and countryside. 
 EVENTS
 An anniversary-inspired series sponsored by the city will run through the year, including lectures on local history, art and architecture, screenings of classic movies on summer nights in the city's parks, a grand dinner at Las Golondrinas Ranch in July and a Gala Ball on New Year's Eve. (More information is available at santafe400th.com.) 
 Other events this year: 
 International Folk Art Market (folkartmarketg), July 9 to 11. A colorful event drawing artists from 52 countries, and, last year, over 24,000 visitors. An outstanding market in a city of markets. 
 SOFA West (sofaexpo.com/santa-fe), July 8 to 11. The International Exposition of Sculpture Objects and Functional Art fair returns to the Santa Fe Community Convention Center.
 Indian Market (swaia.org), Aug. 21 and 22. An unrivaled market of Indian arts and crafts.
 Spanish Market (spanishmarket.org), July 24 and 25. The 59th annual market, featuring work by local Hispanic artists.

HEADLINE: The Debtor The World Still Bets On

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For decades -- through political upheaval and wars and wild bouts of deficits or inflation -- the debt of the United States has always been rated AAA, the gold standard of creditworthiness by which all nations are compared.
 That was true before President Obama published his budget on Monday, with its projections of huge American deficits over the next decade and beyond. Astoundingly or not, it was as true after those estimates were published. Of course, had it been the United States Widget Company projecting red ink as far as the eye could see, no one would lend it a dime.
 The closest thing Washington got to a brush-back pitch was a warning from Moody's, an investor service that rates the sovereign debt of nations: Without action to cut the deficit or a faster-than-expected recovery, the projections for the decade ''will at some point put pressure on the triple-A government bond rating.'' Nobody blinked -- not Congress, not the White House, not the investors around the world who keep buying Treasury bonds to finance this year's $1.6 trillion shortfall, at low interest rates. 
 What explains this oddity? Why is the world betting that the United States will overcome its political deadlock and solve its problems -- believing, it seems, in the truth of Churchill's biting quip that America will always do the right thing, after exhausting every other alternative? And how long can this aura of invincibility last?
 Maybe a long, long time. One of the many things that makes the United States different is that it prints the world's most important currency and can always print more -- one reason investors in government debt remain confident they will be repaid, even if in dollars devalued by inflation or by changing exchange rates.
 There is also value in being the one nation on which the world still depends for security. That helps explain why foreign investors, including China, can denounce American politicians, Wall Street bankers and sleepwalking regulators for creating the current mess -- and still buy at the next Treasury auction.
 This paradox of American financial exceptionalism was unusually clear last week. When the stock market shuddered on Thursday because of worries about national defaults, it wasn't Washington's mountain of debt that got everyone rattled. It was the plight of a handful of profligate spenders in Europe -- notably Greece, Spain and Portugal -- whose comparative foothills of debt suddenly made them dubious credit risks.
 Each of those countries knows the meaning of ''imperial overstretch.'' But it's been a few centuries since Madrid and Lisbon were centers of vast empires, and a lot longer for the Greeks. What brought them down this time was not global ambition but local gridlock, in which politicians could not, or would not, cut spending at a time of high unemployment and social need. Making things worse, they now are on the euro -- meaning they can no longer print their own way out of the problem, either. And it is unclear whether their partners in the euro bloc can afford either to bail them out or to let them default.
 ''They have no easy option,'' said Prof. Simon Johnson of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. ''They can cut spending or raise taxes.''
 Their problems may be minor compared to those of Japan, a battered economic superpower that prints its own currency and whose newspapers, two decades ago, regularly published charts projecting when Japan might overtake America as the world's biggest economy. The papers still run such charts, but now the question is when China will overtake Japan for the No. 2 spot (likely later this year).
 Today, like Toyota, Japan's government is having a braking problem -- it can't figure out how to slow spending on a rapidly aging population, and like everyone else has reacted to recession by hitting the spending accelerator.
 But unlike America, Japan is no longer considered so indispensible. For a quarter of a century it had a AAA rating, then lost it. Now Standard and Poor's warns it may further downgrade Japan because it has failed ''to stem fiscal and deflationary pressures.''
 Japanese finance officials cringe when someone points out that their current rating puts them alongside Slovenia and Chile; a further slide strikes them as catastrophic. Still, by next year things could be worse: Japan's public debt is expected to hit $9.4 trillion, or 181 percent of its gross domestic product. By that measure, Washington still looks good, if only by comparison.
 In 1990, sinking so low was unthinkable in Japan, which poses a question: What about America in 2030? Can the unthinkable occur here, too?
 Jeffrey Garten, the former dean of the Yale School of Management, doesn't dismiss such possibilities. ''Something's changed,'' he said. ''The financial crisis created such a sense of uncertainty about everyone's assumptions that our relative decline is now acknowledged. The possibility that the United States may not be the world's unquestionably best credit risk is now discussed. And that's significant, because so much of this is psychological.''
 It doesn't help, either, that confidence in the rating agencies is also not what it used to be. They missed the dangers of the subprime mortgage crisis. They failed to foresee the 1997 Asian crisis. And they are, in important ways, captives of the past: The United States gets its AAA rating because of its track record -- it has always paid, on time and in full -- and because it has had a stable, comparatively transparent system of governance. Like Churchill said, it has always faced up to its problems in the end. And so, built into the rating, there is an expectation that it always will. Or, as Mr. Garten says, the outside world ''is making assumptions about American political will that few on the inside will.''
 The assumption is that somehow, for example, Medicare costs will be controlled, or that new taxes will help pay for them. That somehow, Democrats and Republicans will join to change the trend because the trend simply cannot go on.
 ''We believe the Obama administration's own projections will not be realized,'' John Chambers, who oversees sovereign debt ratings at Standard and Poor's, said on Friday. He said many of President Obama's officials were in the Clinton administration when deficits turned into a surplus, ''and they know how to do it again.''
 He acknowledges that ''the political scenario is even harder this time.'' But this is a little like the cold war: Because the nuclear option was unthinkable, it never was used. That seems a part of the psychology behind President Obama's budget release. By revealing just how bad the numbers can be, Mr. Obama and his aides seem to be betting that the worst can be avoided.
 The strategy could redefine ''the full faith and credit of the United States.'' These days, it seems to mean: the more faith you have in Washington, the more credit it gets.

HEADLINE: Throwback Skiing: No Heated Gondolas

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
A HALF-DOZEN children were waiting to hang onto a rope tow that would pull them up Mount Prospect, a small ski hill in Lancaster, N.H. I watched them scoot along before I, too, grabbed onto the rope, which, despite temperatures in the teens, felt hot from the friction. 
 It was my first ride up a tow, and I held on for dear life, crouching down so as not to fall over and looking to make sure my skis didn't cross. It was skiing at its most bare-bones, before the advent of the high-speed quad.
 It was also what skiing was like before the days of heated gondolas, ski valets and $97 lift tickets -- luxuries out of reach to many people, even before the recession. With many skiers staying closer to home for a second winter, neighborhood ski resorts are enjoying a resurgence, especially in New England. 
 Small resorts are reporting larger crowds and a few resorts have even reopened. According to Jeremy Davis, founder of the New England Lost Ski Areas Project, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving shuttered ski areas, about 12 small hills have reopened throughout New England in the past 10 years. 
 These resorts hark back to the old days of skiing: no-frills hills with little terrain and a loyal local following. Some are fairly large, with two dozen or so runs and more than one chairlift. Others are true backyard affairs, staffed by volunteers and funded by donations. Instead of chairlifts, they offer rope tows powered by off-the-shelf motors.
 These humbler hills also offer a friendliness absent at large resorts owned by publicly traded corporations and insurance conglomerates. Lift operators at these mom-and-pop-style resorts cheer you on and members of the ski patrol stop to chat. 
 Moreover, these resorts are cheap, another reason their popularity has surged of late. Lift tickets at the medium-size mountains can run about $35 a day, but smaller hills charge a nominal amount -- somewhere between $5 and $15 -- and some take only donations. At Powderhouse Hill in South Berwick, Me., lift tickets cost $5 and doughnuts are free. 
 Intrigued by the low price point and notion of a classic New England experience and spurred on by a recent snowfall, my husband, Dave Shaw, and I decided to bypass the bigger mountains we typically frequent, such as Sunday River and Loon, and give the little guys a shot. 
 We headed north from Boston on a bright, frigid morning toward the Mount Prospect Ski Tow. A dinky little mountain in the northern part of New Hampshire, the resort opened about 80 years ago as a backyard run for local schoolchildren and their parents. It closed in 1997 after years of little snowfall and dwindling numbers of volunteers, but a group of residents with fond memories banded together and reopened it in 2008.
 The three-hour drive took us north through the White Mountains and Franconia Notch State Park, a stunning pass blanketed in white. We exited the highway and drove up Route 3, through the White Mountain National Forest, past whitewashed churches and sweeping views of pine-covered peaks. There's no address on the resort's Web site, just a place marker on a Google map, so Dave kept his eyes peeled while I slowed down before entering the village of Lancaster, a quintessential New England town with small shops. 
 It would have been easy to miss. A tiny sign with a retro logo hung from a pole. There was no skiing in sight, just a little parking lot filled with cars. 
 We pulled in, parked and looked through a dense cluster of trees. The hill was a few hundred feet away, down a small path bisected by a cross-country and snowmobile trail. We grabbed our boots and skis and headed through the woods. 
 Soon it all came into view -- children hanging onto the rope tow, adults schussing down the hill and a small yurt, a puff of smoke from a wood stove coming off its top, to store your snow boots while you ski. There's no hamburger grill, no apres-ski bar, no vending machine. There's not even a restroom. 
 Ben Southworth, a volunteer who runs a timber frame company, was manning the rope tow, which is powered by the engine from a 1957 Chevrolet. Mr. Southworth grew up in Lancaster and wanted to help bring back a place for families to spend a few hours skiing on the weekends. 
 ''It's the way things used to be,'' he said. 
 The hill is open four days a week and only for a few hours -- Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m., and Monday and Wednesday from 3 to 4:30 p.m. A $7 donation per adult skier, $5 for a child, is requested and given to whomever is operating the rope tow. 
 There are three runs, with a total vertical drop of 250 feet. Despite its size, Mount Prospect dares you to ski it hard, and well -- one run is called suicide because of its initial steep descent. 
 I had never used a rope tow, and Mr. Southworth gave some pointers. Wear old or leather work gloves, because friction from the rope can, and will, destroy them. Tuck your poles under your right arm. Crouch down, hang on tight and you'll get up the hill. 
 I hung on to the rope and started ascending. Almost immediately, my poles popped out and lay like wounded soldiers on the snow. I hung on until nearly the top of the hill and let go. The sky was bright and the views of the Kilkenny range were spectacular.
 Someone brought up my poles, and we laughed at my beginner's misfortune. Hanging on to the rope tow was tough, giving my arms and chest a rare skiing workout. I tackled the main trail, which was surprisingly steep for such a small mountain. 
 The hill was fun for about an hour and a half, but we were ready to try something a little bit bigger. So we headed to Whaleback in Enfield, N.H. The area is visible from Interstate 89, about 10 minutes south of the exit for Dartmouth College. 
 The small lodge was filled with local teenagers dropped off by their parents. It smelled like French fries, which you can buy along with a lift ticket and hand warmers at a small counter. 
 For years, Whaleback ''wasn't a lot of fun,'' said Tom Ring, 47, an artist from nearby Quechee, Vt., who was sitting at a picnic table in the lodge with his son Dylan, eating a homemade sandwich. Mr. Ring said that there used to be just a few ''homogenous'' trails that bored experienced skiers like himself. 
 Shuttered in the 1990s, Whaleback reopened in 2004 with new trails, varied terrain and a welcoming attitude. Now, Mr. Ring said, ''It has fresh snow, bumps, jumps; it has it all.'' 
 Except for crowds. There were maybe 25 other people on the entire mountain, and there was a foreign feeling, especially in the glades -- peace and quiet. 
 The conditions were inviting: packed powder that had barely been touched. The trails had whale-themed names (Dorsal, Blubber, Harpoon) and skewed toward the intermediate. The beginner-level green trails were windier and frankly more fun than most at other areas. The intermediate blues were both cruisable and challenging, and the expert blacks took advantage of the mountain's steep pitches. 
 I hopped on the one chairlift, which is very slow, and feels especially slow on 15-degree days. As the chair approached the top, the strains of Led Zeppelin came into earshot and the gregarious lift operator started dancing around and gave a thumbs up. 
 ''Ski the Whale,'' he screamed, his face beaming. 
 The view of the highway isn't the most picturesque, but the mountain itself is covered in snowy pines. I headed down the main chute toward Spout, a blue trail. The first descent is wide and the snow is soft and nicely groomed, ideal conditions for wide turns. The trail was empty, the air frigid, the sun bright. It felt like I was on my own private mountain. 
 I merged onto a feeder trail and gained speed as I headed toward the bottom, a surprisingly steep descent. I continued to go fast, turning tightly, passing the freestyle park and finally coming to a stop in front of the lodge. 
 I headed toward the chairlift again. No one was in line. I'd probably have another trail to myself or encounter a friendly stranger, like a ski patrol member who stopped to chat for about 10 minutes. I hopped onto the chair and started up the mountain, thinking that smaller might just be better. 
 IF YOU GO
 Small ski areas have resurfaced in New England. Be sure to call or check each area's Web site for hours, since most are open only on odd weekdays and weekends. Prices are for a single-day adult lift ticket on weekends. 
 Mount Prospect Ski Tow (Lancaster, N.H.; skiprospect.com; $7 suggested). 
 Reopened in 2008, this small hill uses a rope tow powered by a 1957 Chevrolet engine. 
 Whaleback (Enfield, N.H.; 603-448-1489; whaleback.com; $40). The tiny mountain near Dartmouth College reopened in 2004 with whale-themed trails. 
 Powderhouse Hill (South Berwick, Me.; 207-384-5858; www.powderhousehill.com; $5). 
 North of Boston, this small hill is as friendly as it gets, with free doughnuts between runs. 
 Magic Mountain (Londonderry, Vt.; 802-824-5645; magicmtn.com; $56). 
 Among the larger of the reopened resorts, Magic has two chairlifts and 135 skiable acres. 
 Granite Gorge (Roxbury, N.H.; 603-358-5000; granitegorge.com; $45). 
 This small but challenging mountain offers a terrain park, tubing and cross-country trails. 
 Blandford Ski Area (Blandford, Mass.; 413-848-2860; skiblandford.org; $45)
 This larger community ski area has what few others do -- two terrain parks and five lifts for its 22 trails. 
 Quoggy Jo (Presque Isle, Me.; 207-764-3248; myspace.com/quoggyjo; $8). This small mountain in the northern reaches of Maine has a homey feel.

 BODY:
THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS
 By Rebecca Skloot
 Illustrated. 369 pp. Crown Publishers. $26
 From the very beginning there was something uncanny about the cancer cells on Henrietta Lacks's cervix. Even before killing Lacks herself in 1951, they took on a life of their own. Removed during a biopsy and cultured without her permission, the HeLa cells (named from the first two letters of her first and last names) reproduced boisterously in a lab at Johns Hopkins -- the first human cells ever to do so. HeLa became an instant biological celebrity, traveling to research labs all over the world. Meanwhile Lacks, a vivacious 31-year-old African-American who had once been a tobacco farmer, tended her five children and endured scarring radiation treatments in the hospital's ''colored'' ward. 
 After Henrietta Lacks's death, HeLa went viral, so to speak, becoming the godmother of virology and then biotech, benefiting practically anyone who's ever taken a pill stronger than aspirin. Scientists have grown some 50 million metric tons of her cells, and you can get some for yourself simply by calling an 800 number. HeLa has helped build thousands of careers, not to mention more than 60,000 scientific studies, with nearly 10 more being published every day, revealing the secrets of everything from aging and cancer to mosquito mating and the cellular effects of working in sewers. 
 HeLa is so outrageously robust that if one cell lands in a petri dish, it proceeds to take over. And so, like any good celebrity, HeLa had a scandal: In 1966 it became clear that HeLa had contaminated hundreds of cell lines, destroying research as far away as Russia. By 1973, when Lacks's children were shocked to learn that their mother's cells were still alive, HeLa had already been to outer space. 
 During the eight months that Lacks herself was dying of cancer, the HeLa cells so thoroughly eclipsed her that a lab assistant at her autopsy glanced at her painted red toes and thought: ''Oh jeez, she's a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we'd been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I'd never thought of it that way.''
 In ''The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,'' Rebecca Skloot introduces us to the ''real live woman,'' the children who survived her, and the interplay of race, poverty, science and one of the most important medical discoveries of the last 100 years. Skloot narrates the science lucidly, tracks the racial politics of medicine thoughtfully and tells the Lacks family's often painful history with grace. She also confronts the spookiness of the cells themselves, intrepidly crossing into the spiritual plane on which the family has come to understand their mother's continued presence in the world. Science writing is often just about ''the facts.'' Skloot's book, her first, is far deeper, braver and more wonderful. 
 Skloot didn't know what she was getting into when she began researching the book as a graduate student in 1999. The first time she called Lacks's widower, then living in Baltimore, the person who answered the phone simply heard her voice and yelled, ''Get Pop, lady's on the phone about his wife cells.'' Over the years it took Skloot to gain the family's trust, she came to understand that the only time white people ever called the house was when they wanted something to do with the HeLa cells. Some of the family feel they've been ripped off, cheated by either Johns Hopkins (though the hospital never sold the cells) or the entire medical establishment, which has made enormous profits from the cells.
 Skloot traces the family's emotional ordeal, the changing ethics and law around tissue collections, and the inadvertently careless journalists and researchers who violated the family's privacy by publishing everything from Henrietta's medical records to the family's genetic information. She tacks between the perspective of the scientists and the family evenly and fairly, arriving at a paradox described by Henrietta's daughter Deborah. ''Truth be told, I can't get mad at science, because it help people live, and I'd be a mess without it. I'm a walking drugstore! . . . But I won't lie, I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped make.'' 
 Deborah, a generous spirit, becomes the book's driving force, as Skloot joins her in her ''lifelong struggle to make peace with the existence of those cells, and the science that made them possible.'' To find the mother she never got to know, she read hundreds of articles about HeLa research, which led her to believe that her mother was ''eternally suffering'' from all the experiments performed on her cells. In unsentimental prose, Skloot describes traveling with her to Clover, Va., where Henrietta grew up in her grandfather's cabin, former slave quarters in a town where the black Lackses and the white Lackses don't mix. Suffering from hives and extreme anxiety, Deborah seeks out a relative who channels the voice of God. He tells Deborah to let Skloot carry the ''burden'' of the cells from now on, explaining that the cells have become heavenly bodies, immortal angels. 
 But ''The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks'' is much more than a portrait of the Lacks family. It is also a critique of science that insists on ignoring the messy human provenance of its materials. ''Scientists don't like to think of HeLa cells as being little bits of Henrietta because it's much easier to do science when you dissociate your materials from the people they come from,'' a researcher named Robert Stevenson tells Skloot in one of the many ethical discussions seeded throughout the book. 
 The ethical issues implicated in the HeLa story are many and tangled. Since 1951, science has progressed much faster than our ability to figure out what is right and wrong about tissue culture. In the 1980s a doctor who had removed the cancer-ridden spleen of a man named John Moore patented some of the cells to create a cell line then valued at more than $3 billion, without Moore's knowledge. Moore sued, and on appeal the court ruled that patients had the right to control their tissues, but soon that was struck down by the California Supreme Court, which said that tissue removed from the body had been abandoned as medical waste. The cell line created by the doctor had been ''transformed'' via his ''inventive effort,'' and to say otherwise would ''destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical research.'' The court said that doctors should disclose their financial interests and called on legislators to increase patient protections and regulation, but this has hardly hindered the growth of the field. In 1999 the RAND Corporation estimated that American labs alone held more than 307 million tissue samples from some 178 million people. Not only is the question of payment for profitable tissues unresolved, Skloot notes, but it's still not necessary to obtain consent to store cells and tissue taken in diagnostic procedures and then use the samples for research. 
 The scene in this book that made my hair stand on end occurred when the Lackses followed Skloot into the world of science, just as she had followed them into the world of faith. In 2001, an Austrian researcher at Johns Hopkins named Christoph Lengauer invited the family to his lab. When Deborah and her brother visited, he led them to the basement, where they ''saw'' their mother for the first time, warming frozen test tubes of HeLa in their hands and watching as a cell divided into two under a microscope while Lengauer explained his work. Deborah pressed a cold vial to her lips. ''You're famous,'' she whispered. ''Just nobody knows it.''

HEADLINE: Is the Market 'Priced for Perfection'?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE stock market has changed considerably since early 2000, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index traded at a record high valuation. 
 Today, stocks are only about half as expensive, based on their price-to-earnings ratios. And they've become a bit cheaper lately: the S.& P. 500 has fallen by more than 7 percent since Jan. 19. Yet in at least one important respect, there may be a significant parallel to the situation at the height of the tech bubble. Many market watchers say the late-January sell-off this year could be a sign that the market is again ''priced for perfection,'' said David C. Wright, managing director of Sierra Investment Management in Santa Monica, Calif.
 ''Investors have already priced in everything we can hope for in terms of an economic and profit recovery,'' he said. Stocks rallied 65 percent from March 9 to Dec. 31 last year, and it may be unrealistic to expect that kind of advance now. 
 ''Investors are expecting another Goldilocks scenario,'' he said, adding that economically disappointing news is now likely to drive the markets lower in the coming months.
 James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist in Minneapolis, for Wells Capital Management, said that ''when the market gets extended and optimism emerges, a sense of vulnerability develops.'' In this case, the market was vulnerable to what Mr. Paulsen described as ''government volatility.'' 
 In the January sell-off, the big winners from last year, like emerging-market stocks and shares of blue-chip growth companies, tumbled the most. And the trouble in the markets began on the heels of several major policy announcements. 
 For starters, China's central bank twice raised a benchmark short-term interest rate last month, aiming to slow the nation's rapidly expanding economy and prevent the growth of a bubble in its financial markets. Although the rate increases were modest, they were widely seen as harbingers of a potential worldwide rate climb this year.
 Investors had been banking on continuing stimulus plans throughout the year from governments around the globe, said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the investment management firm Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif. ''But the question is A) how much more can governments do, and B) how much more should governments do?'' he said.
 The Obama administration announced plans last month for revamping banking regulations that, among other things, would rein in the size and growth of some financial institutions. The White House also signaled its intent, through its 2011 proposed budget, to let the Bush administration's tax cuts for households earning more than $250,000 annually expire at the end of the year.
 Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, noted that there have been fears about the markets' reaction once the era of global stimulus ends. ''The jittery market movements reflect this trepidation,'' he said.
 Could this be the start of a bigger sell-off? Quite possibly. Since the bull market began last March, the S.& P. 500 has not experienced a correction of at least 10 percent, even though pullbacks of that magnitude have historically occurred nearly once a year, according to Ned Davis Research, an investment-consulting firm in Venice, Fla.
 But Mr. Paulsen says he does not believe that worries over shifting government policies will kill this bull.
 ''I don't think this is enough to start a bear market,'' he said. ''I'd be much more concerned if the factors that caused the sell-off were caused by a drop off in the fundamentals.''
 SO far, that has not been the case.
 Indeed, around 80 percent of companies in the S.& P. 500 have beaten analysts' consensus forecasts for profits in the fourth quarter, and more than two-thirds have exceeded expectations for revenue.
 Some strategists say the market is overlooking this good news. ''I was surprised that investors looked past pretty favorable economic and earnings data to focus on the Washington headlines,'' said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. 
 But then again, Mr. Ablin said, he was not surprised by the recent pullback because ''the market was -- and probably still is -- fairly to fully priced.''

BYLINE: By KELLY FEENEY

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH penny candies haven't cost a cent for a long time, they are still relatively cheap treats. That may be one reason that retro-themed candy shops have been opening around the state, defying the difficult economy. 
 ''The great thing about bulk candy is that you can go by your budget and spend what you have,'' said Liliana Carvalho, 40, owner of Lily's Kandy Kloudz in Millburn, which opened in November. ''Kids come in and spend 50 cents or $10.'' 
 Following is a sampling of New Jersey sweet shops; with Valentine's Day approaching, they are well stocked with goodies. 
 Dulce Candy Boutique, Montclair
 This store has a whimsical, upscale feel; jawbreakers and wax bottles, in elegant glass jars, line shelves set against walls painted a rich Tiffany blue. Topiaries made from gumballs accent the entrance table, as do boxes of organic fair-trade chocolates.
 ''We are a nostalgic-inspired, retro-infused candy shop with a contemporary feel,'' said Diana Dimonda, 37, who along with her sister, Melissa Tripoli, 34, opened Dulce Candy Boutique in August. 
 There are more than 85 types of penny candies at Dulce, including Laffy Taffy, lemon drops, sugar-free chocolates and French Burnt Peanuts. They are sold by weight -- $2.99 a quarter pound -- or for a nickel apiece. 
 There are vegan and gluten-free treats, as well as a host of allergen-free sweets (made without nuts) and many hard-to-find candies like Sky Bars (prices vary). There's even a cotton-candy machine ($2 a bag).
 The sisters also design candy buffets for weddings and other parties and make care packages like the ''exam cram'' -- stuffed with sugary fuel for students ($34.99, with about two dozen kinds of candy). 
 Then there are various decade samplers, like one with a 1940s theme, filled with candies that were popular in that era, like candy buttons and Sugar Daddy lollipops ($34.99).
 One customer, Alyson Linefsky, 44, of Montclair, who recently visited the shop for the second time, said, ''Some things are a little more expensive -- I think Milk Duds are cheaper at the gas station -- but I love the retro candy here, and I'd gladly pay a little more for it.'' She took home a large $1 popcorn ball.
 Dulce Candy Boutique, 17 Church Street, Montclair; (973) 509-2221. dulcenj.com.
 Lily's Kandy Kloudz, Millburn
 Even the soundtrack is themed at this tiny shop -- ''I Want Candy'' was playing one recent afternoon. There are nearly 100 kinds of bulk candy here, including about 40 flavors of jelly beans; shelves are lined with Smarties, mouth-puckering sours and Jujyfruits. Candy costs $2.25 per quarter pound. 
 Ms. Carvalho previously owned a Ricky's Candy, Cones and Chaos franchise in Summit. But unlike that shop, which served ice cream and hosted parties, Lily's Kandy Kloudz serves only candy, and Ms. Carvalho focuses on special events, like making candy buffets for sweet-16 parties.
 Her specialty is a candy tree, an edible arrangement, like the one made with Dum Dum Pops, which costs $50 for the medium size. She also makes large trees for events like bar mitzvahs that cost $250 to $500; they can be rented for less. (With a rental, you return the tree's terra cotta planter, but you get to eat the candy.) 
 Lily's Kandy Kloudz, 348 Millburn Avenue, Millburn; (973) 218-6254. lilyskandykloudz.com. 
 The Candy Shoppe, Hoboken
 Meg Rankin, 44, got the idea of opening a candy shop during her long career as an event planner. ''I was constantly setting up candy tables'' for corporate clients who wanted ''something fun,'' she said. 
 These days, although Ms. Rankin arranges parties for adults held at her store, the Candy Shoppe, which she opened in February 2009, has a main clientele that is far younger. 
 One customer, Maren Balint, recently celebrated her third birthday here along with 15 friends. Maren's mother, Elena Balint, 37, of Hoboken found the store ''colorful and very nostalgic.'' 
 The Candy Shoppe has more than 200 kinds of treats. Jars are filled with a mix of old-fashioned and new candies: lightly salted Finnish licorice, Peachy Penguins and Zotz, for example, all $8.99 a pound; chocolate bars and other larger items are priced separately. 
 Activities at children's parties include making candy sushi rolls using Swedish Fish, along with green Sour Belts as nori, Nerds as roe and Rice Krispies Treats as the rice. 
 At Maren's party, the children decorated picture frames with Starbursts and SweeTarts, and listened to a story. Of course, they picked out candy to take home, too. 
 Parties cost $250 for up to 12 children; the price includes the use of the space, the staff, the activities and candy bags that the children put together. Parents can bring in pizza and cake. 
 The Candy Shoppe, 59 Fourth Street, Hoboken; (201) 222-6872. hobokencandy.com. 
 Candyteria, Asbury Park
 Willy Wonka would feel at home at Candyteria, which has a staggering 400 types of kaleidoscope-colored candy and chocolate and a fun setting on the Boardwalk with an ocean view.
 Hand-cranked canisters dispense treats like Atomic Fireballs, Mary Janes and more than 24 types of Jelly Bellies ($2.49 a quarter pound). 
 ''I love it when people come in and say, 'Oh, my God, I haven't seen this since I was a kid,''' said Scott Petrillo, 43, who opened the shop with his partner, Sal Chiarelli, 41, in 2008. He was referring to candies like Necco Wafers, Charleston Chews and Sugar Babies.
 ''I remember going to candy stores on the Boardwalk,'' said Mr. Petrillo, who grew up in New Jersey. But he and Mr. Chiarelli, who live in Manhattan, now spend summers here. 
 Of course, it wouldn't be the Jersey Shore without saltwater taffy and fudge. In summer, the place is packed, especially on holiday weekends. Winter is quieter, but the shop is open five days a week, Thursday to Monday.

HEADLINE: Electric Motors, Made to Order

BYLINE: By LINDSAY BROOKE

 BODY:
THE electric motors that drive today's hybrids and electric vehicles are not so different from those pioneered by Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse a century ago. 
 Like their predecessors, modern electric machines, to use the engineers' preferred term, are composed of two elements: a fixed housing that contains copper wire wound around an iron core, called the stator, and a rotor that spins within the stator's open center. 
 The interaction of electric current and magnetic fields between the stator and rotor create rotational torque to spin the motor's shaft -- and turn the wheels.
 Tailoring electric motors for duty in vehicles has necessitated the development of new materials, sophisticated electronic controls and some clever design variations, said Heath Hofmann, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
 ''The auto companies are focusing on machines capable of operating over a much wider speed range than typical fixed-speed industrial motors,'' he said. Two primary designs for electric machines, A.C. induction and permanent-magnet, prevail in today's hybrids and E.V.'s. They differ mainly in the construction and operation of their rotors. 
 The magnetic field of the rotor in an induction motor is generated by an electric current flowing through its copper windings. 
 In the rotor of a permanent magnet design -- the type of motor the Chevrolet Volt will use -- the field is generated entirely by strong magnets, without the need for current. More powerful motors can be built by making the magnets of rare-earth metals like neodymium, which increases the rotor's magnetic flux (its total amount of magnetic field) and enables it to make more power.
 Each motor type has its benefits and drawbacks. Permanent-magnet motors generate less rotor heat than inductive types, which aids efficiency. But as the motor's size grows, magnetic losses increase proportionately, reducing efficiency. 
 Because permanent magnets tend to be brittle, Professor Hofmann said, General Motors, Toyota and others embed the magnets in the rotor, and the magnets are fairly expensive. There are strategic concerns: China has a near-monopoly on known rare-earth metal sources. 
 Induction motors do not suffer proportionate losses as size increases, and their design makes them capable of generating high power by operating at high speeds; the motor of the Tesla Roadster spins up to 14,000 r.p.m. They are generally less expensive to produce than permanent magnet types. 
 Specialist motor companies began improving automotive e-motors long before hybrid cars became popular. Remy, for example, invented a new stator-winding design that uses rectangular wire, rather than round wire, with windings that are arranged in multiple layers. The company says its design reduces heat. 
 For automakers, choosing a design boils down to a horses-for-courses decision. Induction motors appear to be the choice for battery E.V.'s where high performance is a main requirement, Professor Hofmann said. For economy-focused hybrids, permanent magnets may be better. 
 ''I think it will be application-specific,'' he said.

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 SO many of the scenes from this earthquake have reminded me of the early days.
 I first stepped onto the broad central square that was the heart of the Haitian government on the morning of Feb. 7, 1986. Just hours earlier, when it was still night, I'd seen Jean-Claude Duvalier, heir to his father's dictatorship, flee the country with his wife, children and mother, driving a BMW sedan down the airport road and taking it onto a United States cargo plane bound for France. He'd left so late that I was exhausted when dawn came, but still we all descended on the sprawling plaza to see what the new day would bring. Haiti's experiment with democracy had begun, sort of. 
 Without Mr. Duvalier, Haiti was a new country, or so we imagined, and so the Haitians imagined, too, initially. That Feb. 7, 24 years ago today, belonged to the Haitian people, and they paraded by the tens of thousands into the square. Here they were surrounded by the structures of Haitian government: the palace, first of all, and the Duvaliers' paralytic, underutilized Justice Ministry, and so many other municipal buildings that had been filled with rot and corruption. Down the people flocked, carrying freshly cut branches in their upraised fists like symbols of a new life. With the dynasty at last evicted, the Haitian state could finally rise to its mission -- to serve the Haitian people. 
 The Haitians hadn't just gotten rid of Baby Doc, after all. They'd also begun to expunge the legacy of his father, Francois Duvalier, a far more important historical figure than Jean-Claude. Papa Doc, who died in 1971 and bequeathed the country to his feckless 19-year-old son, had ruled for 14 long years as an old-fashioned dictator. He used the apparatus of the state to sweep away his enemies, to spy on opposition leaders and to murder perceived and actual rivals, their families, their maids, their dogs. He left corpses on street corners to rot, burned down houses, sometimes with the residents locked inside, lied without shame to foreign officials and the press and shut down all speech at home. He patrolled the countryside with a network of underlings and thugs. 
 With his ultraviolent rule, Papa Doc set a tone for Haitian governance that has been copied since, but never quite duplicated. Still, his regime was based not just on violence but also on ideology. He'd come to power as a noiriste, an advocate for black power in a country where black power had a singular meaning: to end the rule of Haiti's mulatto elite, which had been in control of the country's economy and cosmopolitan life for more than a century, and whose hegemony had been strengthened by the United States during its military occupation from 1915 to 1934. 
 Papa Doc wanted what the elite had, literally (houses, bank accounts, businesses, land, status), and black power was the ideology he used to justify his depredations. He was the Midas of corruption, though, and noirisme in Haiti was undone by his rule. Although the dark-skinned middle class was empowered during his regime, by the time his son was overthrown (taking his light-skinned and controversial wife with him), most of that class was also eager to see the end of Duvalierism. The family's rigid kleptocracy had further impoverished and isolated Haiti, and everyone wanted out. (And the story continues: Last week, a Swiss court agreed to release more than $4 million in no doubt ill-gotten gains to Jean-Claude Duvalier.)
 The fervor of that February morning nearly a quarter-century ago flooded into the days and weeks that followed, and a kind of ad hoc movement emerged from the people's desire for change and a new social order. Off the people tramped: to the offices of Ernest Bennett, Jean-Claude's father-in-law (a BMW distributor, interestingly). To the Duvaliers' ''country'' house on the side of the mountain above Port-au-Prince. To the homes of Duvalierist officials, supporters, enforcers. To the headquarters of the Tontons Macoute, the Duvaliers' secret police. 
 In each of these places, crowds both angry and gleeful gathered to participate in what was by then called the dechoukaj, or uprooting, in Haitian Creole. All over the country, in mountain villages and coastal towns, the same phenomenon. Piece by piece, usually without tools, the people took down targeted buildings and removed what was inside, erasing the dynasty from the country's architecture. 
 In St.-Marc, on the western coast, I watched the people remove bathroom fixtures from the home of a Tonton Macoute, and drop them outside. On Delmas Road in Port-au-Prince, I saw them burn an official's files and smash his televisions. At the Duvaliers' country house, tiles from the walls were taken one by one. At Macoute headquarters in Petionville, the tiny, latrine-like prison cells were destroyed and all the furnishings shattered. Under the permissive influence of dechoukaj, people went too far, and there were many hideous summary executions of Tontons Macoute and others. In the end, the people descended on the national cemetery in Port-au-Prince and stone by stone, cement block by cement block, tile by tile, put to ruin the elaborately ugly Duvalier family mausoleum. 
 Dechoukaj could rip apart cement and exhume the dead, but it could never quite uproot Duvalierism. Duvalierism, it turned out, was a political state of mind, not a phenomenon arising from a single figure. In a land utterly impoverished by its historical and geopolitical heritage, no dechoukaj could fully uproot the longstanding political culture: the desire for a strong leader to make things better single-handedly; the reflexive populist recourse to a cult of personality; the autocratic tendencies of the political class.
 So while Haiti moved forward in its experiment with democracy, it was with a halting step. In 1990, Haitians elected a former Roman Catholic priest, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a kind of political dechoukeur himself, in the first free and fair elections in the country's history. But coups, a mistrustful elite, foreign meddling and his own little-d Duvalierist tendencies conspired to destroy Mr. Aristide's presidency. 
 In a complicated and extended political dance, Mr. Aristide was ultimately followed by Rene Preval, whose administration, while certainly not incandescent, had a calming influence on the roiling tide of Haitian politics. At best, dechoukaj, with its tear-down agenda, made it possible for this seemingly lesser politician to ascend, a president who practices a special brand of passive, weak-man politics. 
 Over the last few weeks, foreign analysts have implied that the earthquake may have undermined even these modest democratic gains. But what I saw in Haiti after the disaster led me to a different conclusion. Although the earthquake's killing and destruction were of an unimaginable scale, we may be in a moment of grand apres-dechoukaj, a moment of democratic building up. 
 There is no strongman now, no juntas, no Duvalier to tell the people what to do. (No President Aristide, either, who, from his exile in South Africa, is weeping over the earthquake in front of the cameras, and hoping to come home.) Instead, the Haitian people themselves have marched into the dechouked field and set about rebuilding the country.
 This is what I saw as I traveled around the country on foot and on motorbike a week after the quake struck: families and neighborhood groups putting up shelters; people cooperating with aid organizations to get food for their flattened neighborhoods; teacher's assistants hired by parents in the newly builtshantytowns to teach and amuse children whose schools fell down (about 300 teachers at a conference died during the earthquake when their meeting hall collapsed). Men working in teams to remove reusable construction materials from the wreckage. Women sweeping debris from the roads with their graceful, primitive brooms. Young people caring for the wounded in makeshift clinics.
 Maybe utter destruction concentrates the mind. In these conditions, do-it-yourself democracy simply works best. The quiet president, operating behind the scenes with the international community, instead of strutting before the foreign press and claiming he'll fix everything, is perhaps at this moment not such a bad leader for Haitian democracy, after all. 
 When you stand in the rubble of Port-au-Prince -- so recently an affecting and even a heart-tugging city that functioned on a complicated, hypercharged fuel of chaos, exposed wiring, pig slop, smog, gingerbread turrets, hot cooking oil, rum, cockfights and bougainvillea -- you begin to see that Haiti's soul resides in its people. Out of this horror, maybe they will finally be released. That is, if the rains or another quake doesn't stop them in their tracks.

HEADLINE: Group of 7's Finance Ministers Stand by Stimulus Programs

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Finance ministers from seven of the world's biggest economies concluded a meeting in the Canadian Arctic on Saturday with pledges to maintain their fiscal stimulus programs, despite rising worries among investors about the mounting debts of some European governments. 
 ''We are all absolutely committed to maintaining the support for our economies until we make sure that we have recovery established,'' Alistair Darling, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, said in Iqaluit, Nunavut, where finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 nations were meeting. 
 The European debt crisis, and its spread from Greece to other countries in the euro zone like Portugal, Spain and Italy, were a focus of the two-day talks. 
 ''The European authorities gave us a very comprehensive review of the program now in place to address the challenges faced by the Greek economy,'' the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told reporters. He added that the officials had assured the group that they would manage the problem ''with great care.''
 Privately, American officials have said there is next to no chance that Greece will default on its debts. They said European officials were balancing a conviction that the International Monetary Fund should not be involved in solving Greece's problems with their belief that political pressure was necessary for the Greek political leadership to cut spending and raise revenues.
 In a news conference, the finance ministers avoided discussion of the European debt problem. Asked about it, Canada's finance minister, Jim Flaherty, said: ''This is largely a matter to be managed not by the G-7, but by the European Union, which is the way we left it.''
 Some investors and credit-rating agencies fear that the worries over sovereign debt on the Continent might come to afflict Britain and the United States. 
 The I.M.F. warned on Jan. 26 that rising sovereign debt ''could crowd out private sector credit growth, gradually raising interest rates for private borrowers and putting a drag on the economic recovery.''
 A run-up in interest rates on government debts could eventually set off ''a substantial loss in investor confidence in some sovereign issuers,'' the I.M.F. said, with the potential for ''wider spillovers to other countries and markets and a negative shock to confidence.''
 Credit rating agencies have also warned that massive deficits could eventually lead to higher costs for borrowing by governments.
 Despite the warnings on deficit spending, the G-7 ministers said that spending on stimulus programs was necessary in the short run to speed the recovery.
 Mr. Geithner said: ''We all share a commitment that when a strong, sustainable recovery is in place, led by the private sector, and then we're able to then turn to starting to unwind and walk back the exceptional measures we took in this crisis, that we do that with great care, not to undermine the prospects for a strong recovery.''

FREEFALL
 America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy 
 By Joseph E. Stiglitz
 361 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95
 This is a useful and timely book. Joseph E. Stiglitz is one of the two or three score pundits, economists and historians who more or less predicted the disasters that have overtaken the American economy. And as a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under Bill Clinton, he has the political credentials to criticize the new Democratic administration as well. 
 ''Freefall'' has three standout strengths. First, it is a powerful indictment of Wall Street, the United States financial sector and the Federal Reserve Board. Second, it offers a reluctant but persuasive elaboration of how the Obama administration decided to embrace the financial sector and the Fed, continuing and enlarging both the bailout and the too-big-to-fail philosophy that it inherited from George W. Bush. Finally, it is a blunt attack on Stiglitz's own profession, for transforming ''scientific discipline'' into ''free-market capitalism's biggest cheerleader.'' 
 Admittedly, indictments of Wall Street and the Fed have become a staple over the last six months. But Stiglitz's virtue is that he minces few words. Fed policies worked only by ''replacing the tech bubble with a housing bubble,'' he says. ''In virtually every interpretation of the crisis, the Fed was at the center of the creation of this and the previous bubble.'' And ''in the Frankenstein laboratories of Wall Street, banks created new risk products . . . without mechanisms to manage the monster they had created.'' Meanwhile, innovation on Wall Street was ''directed at ''circumventing regulations, accounting standards and taxation.'' Stiglitz, who fears that Wall Street still dominates Washington, is clearly a man outraged. 
 The crisis was at its worst in 2008-9. But while that ''freefall'' is over, Stiglitz remains ambivalent at best about the future.
 Stiglitz supported Obama for president and still finds things to praise about him. But the criticism starts to flow as early as his second chapter, where Stiglitz contends that Obama chose a conservative strategy that he calls muddling through. The president may have been concerned to maintain national unity, but the risk, Stiglitz writes, ''was that the problems were more like festering wounds that could be healed only be exposing them to the antiseptic effects of sunlight.''
 He amplifies: ''The Obama administration also didn't have (or at least didn't articulate) a clear view of why the U.S. financial system failed. Without a vision of the future and an understanding of the failures of the past, its response floundered. At first, it offered little more than the usual platitudes of better regulation and more responsible banking. Instead of redesigning the system, the administration spent much of the money on reinforcing the existing failed system.''
 Warming to his indignation, Stiglitz adds: ''Remarkably, President Obama, who had campaigned on the promise of 'change you can believe in,' only slightly rearranged the deck chairs on the Titanic. Those on Wall Street had used their usual instrument -- fear of 'roiling' the markets -- to get what they wanted, a team that had already demonstrated a willingness to give banks ample money at favorable terms.'' Members of the team included Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers, ''who proclaimed that one of his greatest achievements as secretary of the treasury in 1999-2001 was ensuring that the explosive derivatives would remain unregulated.'' 
 The second half of ''Freefall'' turns to proposals for getting America out of the crisis. Unfortunately, some are far-fetched -- a new socially aware method for calculating the gross domestic product, for example -- and the final chapter is platitudinously entitled ''Toward a New Society.'' Yet surely part of the reason Stiglitz has to try so hard to find upbeat solutions lies in the enormous damage done by the Bush and Obama administrations: ''because of the choices that have already been made, not only will the downturn be far longer and deeper than necessary, but also we will emerge from the crisis with a much larger legacy of debt, with a financial system that is less competitive, less efficient and more vulnerable to another crisis.'' Instead, Stiglitz says, ''the government should have played by the rules of capitalism and forced a financial reorganization'' -- conservatorships or the like that would have put the burden of mismanagement and malfeasance on shareholders, managements and bondholders, not the taxpayers. 
 ''The oddest proposal coming from the Obama administration,'' he says, ''involved giving the Federal Reserve -- which failed so miserably in the run-up to the crisis -- more power. It was another whitewash based on the premise of rewarding failure.'' Presumably, Stiglitz regrets the decision to reappoint Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Over all, ''the Bush and Obama administrations underestimated the severity of the recession. They believed that providing money to the banks would restore the economy to health, reignite the flow of credit and resurrect the real estate market. The Obama stimulus was designed to get the country through the interim while all this happened. Each of these hypotheses was wrong.'' 
 Many of Stiglitz's pages carry the message ''bipartisan indictment'' in invisible ink. But despite acknowledging that ''dealing with this crisis -- and preventing future crises -- is as much a matter of politics as it is economics,'' he avoids more than occasional references to the profound politics involved. Perhaps this is because he wrote this book before November's New Jersey and Virginia elections, when Republicans won the governorships of both states, not to mention Scott Brown's stunning victory in the Massachusetts Senate race in January. Those outcomes, along with more recent polls, show that the voters perceive the Democrats' complicity in the derelict economy and the abuses of finance. With economic luck, the Democrats may yet smile through this November's elections, but recent forecasts suggest a Republican gain of 20 to 30 seats in the House and 6 in the Senate. No one can predict what such a Congress would do in 2011 and 2012, but these forecasts may also color what the present Congress does in 2010.
 Stiglitz's indictment of the economics profession rings true in many ways but is ill-informed or naive in others. His singling out of neo-Keynesian liberal economist colleagues as the thinkers who warned of an implosion screams of parochialism. The former Fed chairman Paul A. Volcker, these days a moderate conservative, thought one likely five years ago. Anna Jacobson Schwartz, the co-author of a financial history with the monetarist guru Milton Friedman, dismissed Bernanke in 2008 as a bumbler without a plan. Indeed, conservatives have been far more vocal critics of the Federal Reserve Board than neo-Keynesians. And it was Republican members of the House of Representatives who in the autumn of 2008 bolted in large numbers to vote down the first bailout. 
 My own background is Republican, but since 1993, I have published several books that drew on economic history to warnabout the dangers in the financialization of the United States -- that is, in how the financial sector (finance, insurance and real estate) had come to dwarf manufacturing as a percentage of gross domestic product. Previous leading world economic powers that financialized, like Spain, Holland and Britain, all lost their global hegemonies, and the United States is now at risk. 
 Alas, because so many ideologies and interest groups have partly valid critiques, reform in Washington may well be stalemated. The financial industry will most likely block any far-reaching overhaul, even though it will not be able to put its own broken Humpty Dumpty back up on the wall. That bleak conclusion may not be too far from what Stiglitz himself thinks.

HEADLINE: West Rejects Iran's Claim That Nuclear Deal Is Near

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH and THOM SHANKER; Nicholas Kulish reported from Munich, and Thom Shanker from Ankara, Turkey.

DATELINE: MUNICH 

 BODY:
As Iran's foreign minister met with the chief of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency here, the United States and Germany rejected Iran's assertion that it was close to accepting an international compromise on its nuclear program.
 Western officials expressed deep skepticism toward Tehran's contention that a deal was close for having uranium enriched abroad for Iran's controversial nuclear program. 
 The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, said that the Iranians presented no new proposal or counterproposal during a meeting on the sidelines of a security conference here Saturday.
 ''Dialogue is continuing,'' Mr. Amano said. ''It should be accelerated. That's the point.'' 
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that actions by Iranian leaders did not back up their conciliatory public statements. ''Based on the information that I have, I don't have the sense we are close to an agreement,'' he said at the conclusion of talks with Turkish leaders in Ankara.
 As if to press that point, one of the topics on the defense secretary's agenda was how Turkey might join a NATO-wide missile defense system, which would be focused on the possibility of an attack from Iran.
 Mr. Gates was asked to respond to comments made Friday by Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, who had told the politicians and military leaders attending the security conference here in Munich that his nation might be close to a deal to have uranium enriched abroad.
 Mr. Gates scoffed at the statement, saying such public talk of compromise did not match Iran's dealings with the atomic energy agency or its stance in continuing, multilateral negotiations to make certain that Tehran could never build a nuclear weapon.
 But Mr. Amano called his meeting with Mr. Mottaki ''a very interesting discussion,'' adding that ''the I.A.E.A. absolutely can play a role as an impartial, good office.''
 Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, who met with Mr. Mottaki on Friday, said Saturday at the same conference in Munich that his discussions with the Iranian delegation had ''not made me change my mind'' about Iran's intentions.
 Speaking on the very stage occupied the night before by Mr. Mottaki, President Obama's national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, said that Iran's ''puzzling defiance'' compelled ''all of us to work together as allies and partners on a second track of increased pressure.''
 General Jones said, ''Indeed, the unprecedented level of international consensus and unity on Iran with regard to its nuclear program demonstrates that Tehran must meet its responsibilities or face stronger sanctions and perhaps even deeper isolation.''
 But that consensus is not as complete as the United States and its Western allies would like to portray it. China, in particular, has resisted calls for new sanctions, saying it would prefer to continue negotiating. That stance was reiterated in Munich on Friday by China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, who said, ''It's better for us now to concentrate on consultation and dialogue.''
 Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said Saturday that he met with Mr. Mottaki for more than an hour the day before and stressed that Iran must cooperate with the atomic energy agency and answer the agency's pending questions. Russia has been increasingly frustrated by Iran's recalcitrance.
 Iran continues to violate the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Mr. Gates said Saturday in Turkey, and he indicated that it might be time to move toward tougher economic sanctions.
 ''The reality is they have done nothing to reassure the international community that they are prepared to comply with the N.P.T. or stop their progress toward a nuclear weapon,'' Mr. Gates said.
 If Iran is serious, the defense secretary said, it should immediately turn over its stated stockpile of low-enriched uranium to the atomic energy agency.
 The longer Iran continues to enrich that radioactive material, he noted, the value of current proposals as a means to offer security reassurances ''is diminishing.'' 
 On Saturday at the conference, Mr. Mottaki said that he had ''a very good meeting'' earlier in the day for half an hour with Mr. Amano about the enrichment proposal. Mr. Mottaki repeated his statement that an agreement was near and said that the agency would play ''the major role'' in the exchange of fuel.
 ''Now there is the political will among the parties involved for proceeding,'' Mr. Mottaki said. In response to critical comments by the speaker of Iran's Parliament, Ali Larijani, about a possible deal, Mr. Mottaki said, ''In Iran, there is only one voice about the issue, and that is the exchange of fuel has been accepted and recognized.''
 Mr. Mottaki continued to insist that, under any deal, Iran would determine the amount of uranium enriched abroad. ''It is very common that in business a buyer talks about the quantity and the seller only offers the price,'' he said. ''We determine the quantity on the basis of our needs, and we would inform the parties about our requirements.''

HEADLINE: Delays and Rules Do Little to Tamp Down Contests for Parliament in Iraq

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
The campaign for Iraq's parliamentary elections does not officially begin until next week. But for the crowd gathered beneath a tent sponsored by the Sadr movement in the southern neighborhood of Dora, it was well under way.
 The tent was festooned with portraits of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, whose death in 680 was commemorated by millions of Shiites in recent weeks. 
 Outside, men dressed in mourning black stood under the shade of portraits of the movement's leader, Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American cleric who now leads a powerful Shiite party, the Iraqi National Alliance. To the rhythm of religious chants thundering from countless loudspeakers, other men beat their chests in a move as theatrical as it was martial. Inside the tent, a sheik lectured a few dozen listeners about Imam Hussein's life and his death, a seminal moment in Shiite history. 
 It was part religious ritual, part social gathering -- and all politics.
 ''They are our leaders,'' Rassoul Tohmeh, a 55-year-old man who was serving tea to fellow pilgrims, said of Mr. Sadr and his father, who was assassinated in 1999. ''They are the children of the prophet. The Sadr movement is the most honorable party. Of course I'll vote for them.''
 The campaign was postponed last week in the wake of a court decision that overturned a ban on hundreds of candidates, leaving a cloud of confusion over who was running and who was not. Election officials are asking the Supreme Court to step in, and some lawmakers are talking about postponing the elections. 
 On Saturday, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, following a meeting with political and judicial leaders on the crisis over disqualifications of candidates with ties to the Baath Party of Saddam Hussein, called for the court to resolve the appeals by the start of the campaign this week. The court had said that it would postpone its ruling until after the elections.
 But neither the chaos nor the delay has stopped candidates from politicking, sometimes furtively and in many cases overtly, seeking to sway a crucial vote that will define the political landscape here for the next four years. The rules, which say the official four-week campaign is to begin Friday, cannot seem to contain the tumult of politics in the new Iraq, where religious symbolism fuses seamlessly with political messages, and campaigning is as colorful and unruly as the nation itself. 
 ''Everything is about the elections now,'' said Ahmad Muhammad, 25, an unemployed university graduate, who started the pilgrimage to Karbala on Wednesday from central Baghdad. ''Soon, even the air that we breathe will be sponsored by some party or leader.''
 The religious observance on Friday of Arbaeen, which in Arabic means the 40th day since Ashura, the day when Imam Hussein was killed, became an occasion for promoting political parties and candidates. To mourn his death, Shiite Muslim pilgrims from all over the country walk hundreds of miles to the holy city of Karbala, 50 miles south of Baghdad, to visit his burial site.
 To ease their march, roads have been closed to traffic. And along these roads, thousands of tents have sprung up, like the one where Mr. Tohmeh was standing, plastered with the iconography of religion, politics and sometimes imagery in between.
 ''The revolution of Imam Hussein represents determination and change,'' one poster said.
 The tents are a place to serve the pilgrims food and offer a spot to rest or spend the night. But the services vary greatly, depending on political affiliations. The Sadr movement tent offered sweet tea, cakes, cookies, bananas, oranges, juice and harissa, a lamb and bean stew traditional for Ashura, all of it distributed without charge. Men standing in the middle of the street urged pilgrims to pay a visit. Those who chose not to were sent off with loads of goods anyway. 
 The movement's party, the Iraqi National Alliance, was ready to spread its message, and unwilling to wait.
 ''The official period for campaigning is too short,'' complained Mahmoud Dahabi, an official aligned with the party. ''We started with preparations for our campaign two months ago.''
 A few hosts tried to keep politics out of the holiday. A tent set up by Ahmad Mussawi, a government employee, offered pilgrims little but harissa. 
 ''Almost all parties came offering help and money, but we refused,'' he said. ''They wanted us to promote them in return, but this occasion is not about politics. It's a religious event.''
 On the road, posters of candidates greet the pilgrims at every major intersection and at the entrance to virtually every town. ''Peace upon you, loyal people,'' said the posters depicting Ibrahim Jaafari, a former prime minister and a candidate for Parliament. 
 A poster for Mr. Maliki reminded people that his primary concern was for the families of those killed or persecuted by Mr. Hussein's government, many of whom were Shiites.
 Mr. Maliki's images have spread overnight, many Iraqis say, in Baghdad and other cities, hanging from the tallest buildings and present in major squares and intersections.
 Merchants report a boom in business at printing presses around the country.
 Politicians have already flocked to major cities. In Basra, residents complained recently that they had to spend long hours stuck in traffic as politicians drove by in large convoys.
 The speaker of Parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai, spoke for more than an hour recently to dozens of Sunni tribal sheiks beneath a tent at the headquarters of the Independent Tribal National Coalition in Baghdad. His remarks were effectively a stump speech, in which he criticized the government for failing to provide security and jobs, while praising Parliament for a series of laws enacted under his leadership.
 Some politicians are campaigning among the dead, literally. In the two biggest Shiite cemeteries in the country -- the Valley of Peace in Najaf, 100 miles south of Baghdad, and the New Valley in Karbala -- young men on three-wheeled vehicles embossed with pictures of candidates and party slogans move between mourners, handing out sweets and pamphlets.
 And then there is the free-wheeling campaign on the Internet, the latest addition to politics in a nation where satellite dishes were banned until 2003. On Facebook, fan pages compete for supporters.
 A war of words has occasionally ensued. There is, for instance, a page for backers of former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, and a page for his detractors.
 ''Why do you hate Ayad Allawi?'' a fan asked on the site.
 ''Because he is worse than Saddam Hussein,'' a rival answered.

HEADLINE: Spending Cuts Meet Selective Support

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
While Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, said he was all for slowing federal spending, he has no appetite for the substantial cuts in farm programs proposed in President Obama's new budget. 
 Representative Todd Akin, Republican of Missouri, issued a press release simultaneously lamenting the deficit spending outlined in the new budget and protesting cuts in Pentagon projects important to his state. 
 And Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a fiscal conservative and a senior Republican on the Budget Committee, vowed to resist reductions in space program spending that would flow back home. 
 The positions of these Republicans -- and similar stances by dozens of other lawmakers of both parties -- are a telling illustration of why it is so hard to control federal spending. Every federal program has a constituency, and even lawmakers who profess to be alarmed by rising deficits will go to the mat to preserve money that provides jobs and benefits to their constituents.
 ''I am not a hypocrite,'' Mr. Sessions said in reconciling his fiscally conservative credentials with his outrage over the administration's proposal to essentially end the human space flight program and allow private enterprise to take on some of the load -- an approach that Republicans typically favor.
 Mr. Sessions said money taken from NASA would not be saved but would instead be directed to other Obama administration priorities that he did not support. He said his preference would be to set an overall spending limit and allow Congress to determine what programs should get the money. ''Then we can debate it,'' Mr. Sessions said.
 Others said that the annual tableau in which members of Congress criticize the spread of red ink even as they reassure voters back home of protection for popular subsidies and Pentagon projects exposed the high degree of cynicism and lack of conviction that colors the fight over Congressional spending.
 ''It shows that in Washington, you can be firm on your opinions; it is your principles you can be flexible on,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff.
 The Republican juggling act on spending comes after a legislative proposal for an independent commission to study ways to cut the deficit stalled in the Senate, partly because some Republicans who had originally backed the idea balked. 
 The reaction to the presidential budget is troubling to some determined spending foes. They see it as a sign that an independent commission may be the only route to reducing the deficit because lawmakers cannot see past their own interests and make the tough decisions.
 ''There are not enough statesmen who will stand up and say, cut it even when it is in my district,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has crusaded against spending by both parties on pet projects known as earmarks.
 It is not only Republicans who are trying to have it both ways. Conservative and moderate Democrats who have pushed against deficit spending also quickly protested the cuts in NASA, military and farm spending. Among them was Senator Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat who leads the Agriculture Committee.
 ''I am standing up for farmers and ranchers and all of rural America once again by opposing cuts that will harm the hardworking men and women who are the backbone of our rural economy,'' Ms. Lincoln said in a statement that accused the White House of unfairly focusing on farm communities. ''While I, too, believe we must reduce the federal deficit, we must all share in this responsibility.''
 But Republicans have made attacks on Democratic spending, the annual federal deficit and the overall national debt a central element of their midterm election campaigns, leading to heightened scrutiny of their budget comments. Democrats have obliged, compiling what they see as hypocritical stances by top Republicans, and many others have sifted through the Republican record as well.
 In their defense, Republicans say they welcome efforts to reduce spending. But they say the Obama proposals are misguided and put crucial programs on the chopping block in an effort to find support for less important initiatives favored by the White House, like climate change.
 Mr. Chambliss, the senior Republican on the Agriculture Committee, said the president was proposing to rewrite farm policy established only last year after months of difficult negotiations.
 ''I'm opposed to the wrong kind of spending,'' Mr. Chambliss said. He said last year's bill cut agriculture spending by $4 billion and gave farmers a five-year blueprint for federal assistance. ''Now this administration seeks to come in midstream and make a change in the way that farmers and ranchers are asked to operate. I think it is just ridiculous.'' 
 Mr. Akin, whose press release attacked the budget both as threatening to ''push our nation farther into the uncharted waters of historic debt'' and as eliminating financing for the Boeing C-17 transport aircraft built partly in St. Louis, conceded that some could see a disconnect. 
 ''There always appears to be,'' said Mr. Akin, who said he tended to favor national security spending. ''There are a whole lot of things that I would be happy to cut. Obviously what we argue about is what are the priorities, where should we be?''
 Mr. Flake, the Arizona Republican, said lawmakers who railed against the deficit and backed local spending projects personified the traditional Washington struggle between national and parochial interests.
 ''That's Congress,'' he said. ''You just have to hope that people move beyond it.''

HEADLINE: States Look to Forestall Hypothetical Mandate

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Health care legislation in Washington may be stalled, but that has not stopped legislatures in more than two-thirds of the states from objecting to one of its central planks: a requirement that everyone buy health insurance.
 The objections, many of them driven by the Tea Party movement, may turn out to be largely symbolic. But they nonetheless serve notice to President Obama and the Democrats of real anger over their health care plans and signal the potential for political upheaval down the road.
 These measures, which are in various stages of ripening in about 36 states, could also pave the way for a major court challenge. 
 Virginia last week became the latest to set about blocking any effort to force its residents to buy health insurance or pay a penalty if they do not. Approved by the State Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, the measure goes this week to the House of Delegates, which is controlled by Republicans, and is all but certain to pass and be signed into law.
 The state would become the first in the country to enact a statute to oppose a basic building block of the Democrats' health care plan. (Most other states are considering constitutional amendments.)
 The twist in Virginia is that Democratic legislators joined with Republicans to move the measure along. In two other states, Iowa and West Virginia, Democratic state legislators have also joined Republicans in similar efforts.
 The movement against the so-called individual mandate began slowly in 2006, after Massachusetts passed a health care law that included the requirement. It picked up steam last summer as anger at the Democratic health care proposals boiled over in town-hall-style meetings across the country.
 And it took on new urgency after Jan. 19, when voters in Massachusetts elected a Republican, Scott Brown, to fill the Senate seat long held by Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat. Although Mr. Brown supported the health care law in Massachusetts in 2006, he has vowed to stop similar proposals in Washington. His mere arrival has denied Senate Democrats their supermajority and brought health care talks largely to a halt.
 ''A number of states have accelerated since Scott Brown,'' said Christie Herrera, director of the health and human services task force of the American Legislative Exchange Council, which is helping to coordinate the efforts opposing a mandate.
 They include crowded hearings, rallies and legislative action not only in Virginia, but also in Georgia, Idaho, Missouri and Pennsylvania.
 Virginia has become something of a canary in the coal mine. Its vote in 2008 for Mr. Obama, its first for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964, was taken as a sign that the state that served as capital of the Old Confederacy was undergoing a historic shift. That premise collapsed a year later, when the state elected a Republican as governor, a harbinger of Mr. Brown's upset win in Massachusetts last month.
 ''Many of the Blue Dog Democrats here are extremely worried about re-election in the fall,'' said Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. ''Health care reform has sent independent voters scurrying to the Republican side, and Democrats are somewhere between worried and panicked.'' 
 Mr. Sabato said passage of the measure in Virginia would help the five State Senate Democrats who supported it, because they could say to voters, ''You don't need to replace us to get a check and balance on Obama.'' And they faced no real downside, he said, because ''everyone thinks health care reform is dead anyway.''
 Supporters of the mandate argue that requiring everyone to have health insurance is essential to making insurance affordable, even as the government provides some people with subsidies. 
 The theory is that broadening the pool of people paying premiums would help insurance companies offset losses they would incur under other provisions of the proposed legislation, like no longer being able to deny coverage to people because of their medical condition or age.
 But opponents say that people should not be forced to buy something they do not want or cannot afford, and that trying to make them do so would be unconstitutional.
 The Virginia Democrats who opposed the State Senate measure said that passing a state law was a waste of time, since Congress had not yet approved a mandate and federal law would override a state law anyway.
 Whether that is the case is not entirely clear. Many constitutional scholars say that federal law generally trumps state law, but conservative lawyers are gearing up to prove them wrong.
 It is somewhat unusual for so many states to move against a federal proposal before it even becomes law, which adds to the uncertainty.
 ''With no final version of federal health reform, no one can safely say right now how such a state law would be applied to something new on the federal level,'' said Richard Cauchi, health program director for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 Despite the momentum in the states, some Democrats in Congress are responding to Mr. Obama's plea during his State of the Union address last month not to ''run for the hills.''
 One is Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a freshman Democrat from Northern Virginia, whose affluent suburban district voted lopsidedly for Mr. Obama in 2008.
 Mr. Connolly dismissed Virginia's move against the insurance mandate as an effort to ''score political points at a moment when people are anxious about the economy and the future of health care.''
 He said that opinion in his district was split over a health care overhaul, and that he would wait to see any final bill before deciding whether to support it. 
 Nonetheless, he said, he favored the insurance mandate because it would expand the risk pool and reduce the number of people who relied on the emergency room for their care.
 ''Doing nothing on health care would be a big mistake, because the path we're on is not sustainable,'' Mr. Connolly said. ''But the length of time this has taken has eroded public confidence. And the White House has to remind people why they voted in the first place for change they can believe in.''

HEADLINE: The Book of Self-Love

BYLINE: By LEE SIEGEL. 
Lee Siegel is the senior columnist for The Daily Beast and the author of ''Against the Machine: How the Web is Reshaping Culture and Commerce -- And Why It Matters.''

 BODY:
In ''Game Change,'' the recent tell-all book about the 2008 presidential campaign, the authors blame John Edwards's narcissism for his downfall and describe Bill Clinton as a ''narcissist on an epic scale.'' Do a Google search on ''Tiger Woods'' and ''narcissist'' and you get tens of thousands of references. Try it with the Salahis and you get thousands more. Rush Limbaugh calls President Obama a narcissist, it seems, every 24 hours, while a writer on The Huffington Post recently declared that ''advanced stages of narcissism thrive on the Right these days.'' 
 This would all sound familiar to Christopher Lasch. Just over 30 years ago, in ''The Culture of Narcissism,'' Lasch, a historian at the University of Rochester, took what was still mainly a narrowly clinical term and used it to diagnose a pathology that seemed to have spread to all corners of American life. In Lasch's definition (drawn from Freud), the narcissist, driven by repressed rage and self-hatred, escapes into a grandiose self-conception, using other people as instruments of gratification even while craving their love and approval. Lasch saw the echo of such qualities in ''the fascination with fame and celebrity, the fear of competition, the inability to suspend disbelief, the shallowness and transitory quality of personal relations, the horror of death.'' ''The happy hooker,'' Lasch wrote, ''stands in place of Horatio Alger as the prototype of personal success.''
 Not all reviewers cottoned to Lasch's relentlessly grim tone, but Time magazine described him as a ''biblical prophet,'' and the broader public embraced his jeremiad. Appearing at a time of inflation and recession, oil shortages, soaring crime rates and faltering cities, Lasch's book leapt onto the best-seller list, making him famous. Jimmy Carter was so taken with Lasch's ideas that he invited the academic author to advise him on the famous ''malaise'' speech of July 1979.
 Lasch wasn't the first to comment on our rising self-absorption. Three years earlier, Tom Wolfe had written an epoch-anointing cover story in New York magazine called ''The 'Me' Decade and the Third Great Awakening.'' But where Wolfe celebrated narcissism as a millenarian outburst of vitality -- ''the greatest age of individualism in American history,'' as he put it with winking enthusiasm -- Lasch saw a decadent defiance of nature and kinship. In ''The Culture of Narcissism,'' he asked a simple question that cut deeper than Wolfe's provocation: How had the radical changes in American economic and social arrangements since the 19th century affected the individual? Armed with Marx's conviction that economic forces shape character and with Freud's insight into the bourgeois mind, he answered with a sulfurous indictment of contemporary American life. ''Long-term social changes,'' Lasch wrote, have ''created a scarcity of jobs, devalued the wisdom of the ages and brought all forms of authority (including the authority of experience) into disrepute.''
 The son of a newspaperman and a social worker with a doctorate in philosophy, the Nebraska-born, Harvard-educated Lasch learned to read history through a psychological lens from the political historian Richard Hofstadter, with whom he studied at Columbia. Lasch, however, rejected his mentor's harsh view of the role that irrational emotions like anxiety over declining social status played in shaping the politics of the middle classes. As if in response, in ''The New Radicalism in America: 1889-1963'' (1965) Lasch wrote sourly about the role a rationalist conception of human nature played in liberal intellectuals' programs for social improvement. In ''Haven in a Heartless World: The Family Besieged'' (1977), an almost Oedipal retort to Hofstadter, he made a blistering attack on the ''therapeutic'' society in which professional elites medicalize acts of will and minimize personal responsibility. To Hofstadter's scorn for unrestrained market forces, Lasch added his own contempt for the way commercial appeals so nicely accommodate the liberal ideal of personal freedom.
 In ''The Culture of Narcissism,'' Lasch again blamed both the right's veneration of market forces and the left's cultural progressivism for weakening the bonds of family and community -- and thus deforming the growth of solid character. Freudian that he was, Lasch laid much of the blame for ''the narcissistic personality of our time'' on the way packs of experts had taken child-rearing out of the hands of parents, thus interfering with traditional stages of attachment, especially to the mother. If such ideas never endeared him to feminists, his critique of late capitalism hardly endeared him to conservatives, either. Corporate bureaucracies, he wrote, ''put a premium on the manipulation of interpersonal relations, discourage the formation of deep personal attachments and at the same time provide the narcissist with the approval he needs in order to validate his self-esteem.'' 
 Lasch saw that same dynamic at work in politics, producing rootless figures devoted solely to managing the impression of managing a crisis. The Bay of Pigs disaster drove Kennedy to ''overcome the impression of weakness'' as he ''blustered'' against Khrushchev at the Vienna summit, while Nixon ''devoted most of his career to the art of impressing an unseen audience with his powers of leadership.'' The narcissism of the politician is thwarted by the narcissism of the voter, whose fantasies of power lead him to identify only with ''winners'' who then arouse his wrath when their shortcomings disappoint him.
 Even as he dug deep into psychoanalytic and social theory and American history, Lasch took in a remarkable range of contemporary experience, making many observations that, if anything, ring more true today. In a chapter called ''The Degradation of Sport,'' he lamented the way big money and free agency were turning the athlete into a mere ''entertainer'' who ''sells his services to the highest bidder,'' bound to his team only in a spirit of ''antagonistic cooperation'' (a term borrowed from David Riesman). Noting how self-help experts make us feel that success or failure is at stake at every moment, he seemed to anticipate the calculating side of social networking. ''The search for competitive advantage through emotional manipulation,'' he wrote, culminates in a sociability that functions as ''an extension of work by other means.'' And long before Stephen Colbert coined the term ''truthiness,'' Lasch perceived that ''the air is saturated with statements that are neither true nor false but merely credible'' -- which only makes it easier for the narcissist to see the world as an extension of his desires.
 In a skeptical cover review in The New York Times Book Review, the literary critic Frank Kermode called ''The Culture of Narcissism'' a ''hellfire sermon.'' Delivering one can be a gratifying exercise, and at times Lasch seems strangely heartened by his despairing diagnosis. He writes as if contemporary culture represented a fall from some earlier, Edenic period. It is hard to take him seriously when he declares that ''the peculiar horror of contemporary life'' makes ''theworst features of earlier times . . . seem attractive by comparison'' or that ''the prison life of the past looks in our own time like liberation itself.''
 At such moments, Lasch's disaffection with so much of contemporary life seems less intellectual than unfathomably personal. ''The True and Only Heaven'' (1991), published three years before his death from cancer at age 61, was an even more alienated tribute to an idealized working class, a sentimental paean that glossed over the way its rage and resentment drove the annihilating antidemocratic movements of the 20th century. It's a book that would probably hearten the Tea Partiers of today.
 But passionate excess is often the price of original perception. The next time you close a book frustrated by the author's ''pseudo self-insight'' or are taken in by someone's ''nervous, self-deprecatory humor,'' the next time you find yourself repelled by the general collapse of ''impulse control'' and by the type of person who ''sees the world as a mirror of himself,'' you might want to seek solace in Lasch's illuminations. The personality of his time, it seems, is even more the personality of ours.

HEADLINE: Obama Pledges to Press Ahead on Goals

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama said Saturday that the Democratic Party should not simply ''regroup, lick our wounds and try to hang on'' during a challenging political season, pledging to find a way for health care and job-creation measures to be passed this year. 
 ''I know we've gone through a tough year,'' Mr. Obama told party advocates, ''but we've gone through tougher years.'' 
 The Democratic National Committee convened its annual winter meeting here as the capital was buried by a storm, which had dumped about two feet of snow on the region. The city was shuttered, but the gathering proceeded as scheduled, with Mr. Obama traveling two blocks from the White House to the Capital Hilton hotel.
 ''It is good to be among friends who are so committed to the future of this party that you braved a blizzard,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Snowmageddon!''
 The president's appearance was the latest in a series of party events as he tries to boost the spirits of Democrats who are bracing for the midterm elections. He acknowledged the difficult headwinds facing the party, but warned against moving away from initiatives on energy, education and financial regulation.
 ''We can't return to the dereliction of duty that helped deliver this recession,'' Mr. Obama said. ''America can't afford to wait, and we can't look backwards.''
 Democrats leapt to their feet when Mr. Obama took the stage, and his 20-minute speech was interrupted several times by applause. But his remarks offered no new strategies for how the administration intends to revive health care overhaul and advance the rest of its agenda.
 The president said he was not surprised that his approval ratings had fallen from where they were a year ago, when the election and inauguration were fresh in the minds of voters. ''Of course people are frustrated, they have every right to be,'' he said. 
 Mr. Obama renewed his call to not abandon health care legislation, which hit a setback when Democrats lost a special election in Massachusetts last month that cost the party its supermajority in the Senate. 
 ''Just in case there's any confusion out there, I am not going to walk away from health care reform,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I'm not going to walk away on this challenge. I'm not going to walk away on any challenge. We're moving forward.''
 The accolades for the president on Saturday belied a nervous mood among Democratic officials who gathered here for the two-day meeting. Several party advocates acknowledged being worried about the year ahead for Democrats, but hoped the defeat in Massachusetts had served as a warning siren.
 ''There has to be some positive news on the economy and jobs. That's what leads people to vote,'' said Don Fowler of South Carolina, a former Democratic national chairman. ''Massachusetts was a viper. We collectively have to do something to tamp down the anger. We've got to produce.''
 Tim Kaine, a former Virginia governor and current chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the party needed to do a ''better job telling the story'' of how the Obama administration saved the country from economic collapse. He said Democrats should not dwell on losing the Senate seat long held by Senator Edward M. Kennedy to Scott Brown, a Republican who was sworn in to office last week.
 ''The ghost of Harry Truman would kill us if he heard us complaining about 59 seats in the United States Senate,'' Mr. Kaine said. ''But we have to learn some lessons.''
 Raymond Buckley, the New Hampshire party leader who also leads the Association of State Democratic Chairs, said too many party advocates were complacent last year as voter anger was growing. He said the Democrats needed to do a better job of fighting their critics and proclaiming their accomplishments. 
 ''Massachusetts was a giant wakeup call,'' said Mr. Buckley, who added that many Democrats had not taken the Tea Party very seriously. ''We have to push back. It's really on our shoulders.''

HEADLINE: Addicted to Haiti

BYLINE: By BEN FOUNTAIN. 
Ben Fountain is the author of the short-story collection ''Brief Encounters with Che Guevara.''

DATELINE: Dallas 

 BODY:
 IN 1999 I made a day trip from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, up to the wanly charming town of Kenscoff, a couple of hours drive into the mountains. I'd done this journey before, but not in several years, and as the road wound upward I couldn't help being astonished by the sprawling mansions that had taken over the hillsides. 
 Where this road had once offered peaceful views of terraced fields, patches of forest, clusters of modest farmhouses, there now hulked villa after mind-boggling villa, as if the McMansions from Dallas's flat-as-a-pancake suburbs had been transplanted to the mountains overlooking Port-au-Prince. Had oil been discovered in Haiti? As every turn revealed new vistas of architectural bombast, my Haitian friend in the passenger seat was shaking his head, muttering the same word over and over:
 Drogue. Drugs. 
 Since Haiti's devastating earthquake, much attention has been focused, rightly so, on the convergence of economic, political and cultural forces that rendered the country so vulnerable to this catastrophe. Many have looked to the past for guidance, and recent weeks have given us earnest and often perceptive analyses of Haitian history, reaching back to its brutal colonial origins, its proud, improbable and staggeringly violent war of independence, and continuing on through the next 200 years of mostly miserable governance, that depressing catalog of revolts, coups, betrayals and interventions -- usually aided, if not procured outright, by foreign powers -- that drained Haiti of so much of its wealth and promise.
 But if Haiti is to be rebuilt, or not merely rebuilt but transformed, then drug trafficking needs to be recognized for what it is, a primary force -- arguably, the dominant force -- in Haitian political life for the past 25 years.
 A 1993 memo, written by John Kerry as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations, asserted that ''there is a partnership made in hell, in cocaine, and in dollars between the Colombian cartels and the Haitian military.'' At the time, Haiti was well on its way to becoming the Caribbean's leading transshipment point for cocaine entering the United States from South America, and while the individual actors may have changed in the years since then, the partnership has continued to thrive. Today, drug trafficking is a billion-dollar-a-year enterprise in Haiti, generating tremendous profits in a country where most people survive on a few dollars a day. 
 In any country, this kind of wealth would provide ample incentive and means for acquiring power, but in Haiti the drug trade exerts an influence out of all proportion to other sectors of society. The narrative of Haitian politics since the fall of the Duvalier regime in 1986 closely tracks the rise of drug trafficking. As Haiti struggled to hold elections in the years immediately after President Jean-Claude Duvalier's ouster, compelling evidence pointed to the involvement in cocaine trafficking of Col. Jean-Claude Paul and other high-ranking officers, a faction of the Haitian military that was, perhaps not coincidentally, especially pitiless in its suppression of the democratic movement. 
 The military continued to be closely linked to the drug trade during Jean-Bertrand Aristide's brief first turn as president, cut short by the coup of Sept. 30, 1991, and little changed after his ouster. Indeed, Port-au-Prince's chief of police, Lt. Col. Joseph Michel Francois, emerged as the next key man in Haitian drug trafficking, presiding over a notorious network of soldiers and paramilitary attaches that, in addition to expanding the country's drug trade, carried out a ruthless program of political terrorism in which thousands of Haitians were murdered. 
 Those years of intense repression coincided with Haiti's rise as the region's major transshipment point for cocaine, a distinction it maintained even after civilian rule was restored in 1994. By 2000, an estimated 75 tons, or 15 percent of the cocaine consumed annually in the United States, was being channeled through Haiti. Drug-related corruption and violence became endemic during Mr. Aristide's second term as president, with many in his inner circle -- including the National Palace security chief, the director of the Haitian National Police, the head of an investigations unit of the National Police, and the president of the Haitian Senate -- eventually serving time in American prisons for violations of American narcotics and money-laundering laws. 
 At virtually every turn over the past two and a half decades, Haiti's attempts to establish the institutions and standards of civil society have been subverted or crushed, often with the hand of the drug trade clearly evident. President Rene Preval's administration made greater strides than any previous government toward true reform, yet progress even before Jan. 12 was tenuous. The National Police remained a weak and uncertain force; the judiciary was dysfunctional; government ministries were highly politicized and rife with corruption; concepts of transparency, human rights and the rule of law were fragile at best. 
 At present, there is no lack of debate on how best to go about remaking Haiti. Plan better. Build better. Push for institutional reform. Pour in many billions of dollars in international aid, with stronger oversight, firmer resolve, greater involvement of the Haitian public and private sectors. An opposing school of thought says that aid should be cut off completely, forcing Haitians to take ownership of their country's fate; only shock therapy can break the enduring cycle of dependence, dysfunction and self-inflicted poverty. 
 Whichever way you lean, chances are that the power and profits of drug trafficking will doom your prescription to irrelevance. Yes, Americans have shown tremendous generosity toward Haiti since Jan. 12 -- more than $20 million in text donations to the Red Cross, $57 million and counting raised by the Hope for Haiti Now telethon, the private planes stacked up at airports in southern Florida, waiting for a landing slot in Port-au-Prince. That's the part of the story that makes us feel good. 
 Then there's the other part. The United States leads the world in cocaine consumption, which means there is a line that goes straight from our stupendous drug habit back to the conditions in Haiti, all those years of toxic governance that set the stage for so much destruction, so much death and injury. 
 So it's come to this: the richest country in the hemisphere and the poorest, the first republic and the second, trapped together in the New World's most glaring modern failure, the war on drugs. It would be naive to hope that Americans will quit their cocaine any time soon for Haiti's sake. But it would be equally naive not to recognize this huge obstacle standing in Haiti's way, and the role we've played in creating it. Our aspirations for Haiti lead straight through our addictions.

HEADLINE: Why Politics Is Stuck In the Middle

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
MARKET competition, under the proper circumstances, has the power to make a business better serve its customers. Cellphone companies, for example, compete via cheaper prices, clearer connections and better apps. Political competition, though no less vigorous, is conducted on very different terms -- and often ends up stifling innovation instead of encouraging it. 
 When viewed through an economist's lens, the quest for voter approval helps explain some recent developments in domestic politics, including the stalling of health care reform and the proposed freeze on the federal government's discretionary spending. 
 Economists approach political competition with a simple but potent hypothesis called the ''median voter theorem.'' Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, proposed the idea in his 1957 book, ''An Economic Theory of Democracy.'' Essentially, the idea is this: Any politician who strays too far from voters at the philosophical center will soon be out of office. 
 In fact, there is a dynamic that pushes politicians to embrace the preferences of the typical or ''median'' voter, who sits squarely in the middle of public opinion. A significant move to either the left or the right would open the door for a rival to take a more moderate stance, win the next election and change the agenda. Politicians will respond to this dynamic, whether they are power-seeking demagogues or more benevolent types who use elected office to help the world.
 When it comes to the big issues, voters at the midpoint usually get the policies, if not always the exact outcomes, they want. In the federal budget, the largest line items include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and military spending -- all very popular programs. The interest on the national debt is mounting because we don't like paying higher taxes now for all those benefits, so our government borrows to postpone the pain.
 Upon his election, President Obama stepped into a world already full of political constraints. He won the White House and significant Democratic majorities in both the House and the Senate -- yet even if American voters were tired of the Republican Party, it's not clear that their underlying opinions had changed very much. 
 Correctly or not, most Americans have failed to embrace the Democratic health care plans. And ever since the Republicans won the special Senate election in Massachusetts, even the Democrats in Congress have stalled on the legislation. It now appears that much of the initial support was thin.
 Senate Democrats, for instance, could overcome a Republican filibuster through a parliamentary process known as reconciliation, but they are waiting, evidently out of fear that voters aren't with them on this issue. 
 Many people are increasingly worried about deficits. That may have led Mr. Obama to announce a freeze on nonmilitary discretionary spending, and yet this freeze refuses to target major, popular budget items like Social Security. The public seems to want the self-image of being tough on spending without giving up the goodies. President Obama may well know better, but he is doing his best to oblige, if only to prevent a Republican landslide this November. 
 The point here is not to belittle or praise the president, but to point out that his hands are tied. The biggest leftward move in American economic policy occurred during the Roosevelt and Truman years, when the Democrats had the upper hand for five consecutive presidential terms. Because of depression and war, people were looking for real change. Competitive forces in politics were relatively weak, and the Democrats had the chance to make their policies stick.
 The Supreme Court's recent ruling on campaign spending also comes into clearer focus through the median voter theorem. The court ruled that the government may not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections. Critics fear that the political influence of corporations will grow, but some academic specialists in campaign finance aren't so sure. 
 For all the anecdotal evidence, it's hard to show statistically that money has a large and systematic influence on political outcomes. That is partly because politicians cannot stray too far from public opinion. (In part, it is also because interest groups get their way on many issues by supplying an understaffed Congress with ideas and intellectual resources, not by running ads or making donations.) It is quite possible that the court's decision won't affect election results very much.
 Of course, the median voter theorem is far from a complete explanation of politics. Sometimes politicians lead public opinion and talk voters into accepting new ideas, as when President Bill Clinton promoted Nafta. And voters often favor conflicting or contradictory policies, like wanting to pull troops out of Iraq but also not wanting Iraq to explode into chaos. 
 Finally, most people aren't very well informed about politics and can be downright irrational or stubborn, which is another reason that political competition isn't always as beneficial as economic competition.
 THE median voter theorem doesn't predict that the legacy of the Obama administration will be a wash. But it does imply that we might find the most important achievements in areas that don't always linger on the front page. For instance, the president's ideas on education, which involve accountability and charter schools and pay for performance, may please the American public and thus make their way into policy. And because education transforms the knowledge and interests of the median voter for generations to come, such acceptance could make for a lot of other improvements.
 If you're looking for change to believe in, and change that will last, the odds are best when political competition is pushing the world in your direction.

HEADLINE: Weary New Orleans Elects White Mayor

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Riding a wave of discontent with political corruption, high crime rates and the slow pace of the city's recovery, Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu was elected mayor of this city by a landslide on Saturday, the first white man to hold the position since his father, Moon Landrieu, left office in 1978.
 Mr. Landrieu won with 66 percent of the vote. His closest challenger, Troy Henry, a businessman and first-time candidate, had 14 percent. 
 ''We're all going together, and we're not leaving anybody behind,'' said Mr. Landrieu in a victory speech, where he was surrounded by his father, his sister -- Mary L. Landrieu, the Democratic senator from Louisiana -- and a crowd of family members, associates and a even a jazz musician or two.
 Mr. Landrieu emphasized his campaign theme of common ground in his remarks, saying that the people of New Orleans had decided to ''strike a blow for unity, strike a blow for a city that decided to be unified rather than divided, a city that understands where there is equal opportunity there is equal responsibility.''
 Given that Mr. Landrieu won more than half of the vote, a runoff election is not necessary.
 In a city that is still mostly black, the victory was both startling in its departure from the past three decades of New Orleans history and predictable, in that Mr. Landrieu was the front-runner the moment he surprised the field and entered the race. He ran unsuccessfully for the post twice before, coming close in 2006 but losing the runoff to the current mayor, C. Ray Nagin, who is prevented by law from running for a third term.
 Because his father oversaw the broad desegregation of the city, starting with a racially mixed brain trust that helped run City Hall, Mr. Landrieu has attracted strong support from black voters. Many residents also said they were drawn to his long political background, having grown weary with Mr. Nagin's outsider approach, which has produced a painfully slow recovery from Hurricane Katrina in the years since 2005.
 Of the more than 17,000 early ballots cast, a disproportionately high number of them were from black voters, said Greg Rigamer, an elections analyst, on WWL-TV, a local television channel. Mr. Landrieu won roughly two-thirds of these votes, Mr. Rigamer said.
 It was a historic outcome of an erratic election, which did not generate much drama on a day-to-day basis but was punctuated every few weeks by sudden, shocking developments.
 Initially, a series of prominent potential candidates, including Mr. Landrieu himself, said they were not interested in running. Then in December, at the last minute, Mr. Landrieu jumped in, throwing the race into chaos. Less than a month later, State Senator Ed Murray, one of the front-runners, surprised everyone by announcing his departure.
 Just as the election was gaining heat, the Saints happened to win a trip to the Super Bowl and all talk of the mayor's race was drowned out for its last two weeks. That made it much harder for lesser-known candidates to gain traction. The lack of general excitement about the race was not simply because football or Mardi Gras drew all the attention -- turnout was high on Saturday despite eight parades in and around the city and an undetermined number of pre-Super Bowl pep rallies -- but also because of this weary city's mood.
 Voters said they had many reasons to be skeptical of big promises and to long for simple good governance: a municipal government that has been rife with infighting; the bribery and money-laundering conviction of William J. Jefferson, who represented New Orleans in Congress for 18 years; and a wave of corruption scandals involving top officials in nearby parishes.
 ''I think we've done some housecleaning already, which kind of gives people hope,'' said Marilyn Winters, 74, who had just cast her vote. ''It's time to make a new start.''
 Linda Newman, a 50-year-old cook voting at a high school in the Bywater neighborhood would not say whom she had voted for, but said she wanted experience. ''I basically went by years of service and years in politics,'' she said.
 After the departure of Senator Murray, Mr. Landrieu, a state legislator for 16 years, was the only candidate with extensive experience in politics and government. The withdrawal of Mr. Murray, who is black, sent shockwaves through the city's black professional classes, which had for years seen the mayor's office as ''the franchise,'' the source of power for blacks who have long felt economically marginalized.
 But for many voters, including many of the blacks who supported Mr. Nagin in the 2006 run-off, there has been a sense of buyer's remorse.
 ''To me Landrieu is best on the issues,'' said Jeanette Jenkins, 62, who is black and who voted for Mr. Nagin over Mr. Landrieu last time. ''A lot of the stuff that should have been done hasn't been done.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies last Sunday about the election of Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu of Louisiana as the mayor of New Orleans overstated the turnout. It was relatively low compared with recent mayoral elections; the turnout was not high. (Turnout early in the day was high.)
