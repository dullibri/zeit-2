HEADLINE: Independent Plants a Factor In the Latest Energy Crisis 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
N.R.G. Energy Inc. was not even a stand-alone company a year ago, but it has big plans for the next few years: building enough power-generation plants to supply the equivalent of 35 million homes. 
 With power supplies tight across much of the United States and Wall Street opening its pocketbook to energy concerns, companies like N.R.G., based in Minneapolis, are reshaping the power-generation industry. 
 Nearly every new power plant in the United States is being built not by an old-fashioned state-regulated utility, but by largely unregulated operations like N.R.G. The independent companies now account for more than 20 percent of domestic electricity generation, a number that is rising quickly as demand for power continues to grow.
The industry's growing market power is starkly evident in the California power crisis, where Gov. Gray Davis is trying to press the independent generators to keep their electricity flowing -- but at cheaper prices -- and to forestall bankruptcy filings by the state's two largest utilities. Those utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, are struggling to pay for electricity they have already bought from the generators, and Mr. Davis said last week that four of the power producers had threatened to force the utilities into bankruptcy. 
California's four-year-old deregulation law has allowed the power producers to grab a larger share of generation capacity than in most states. Indeed, the utilities were under orders to sell their power plants, although California regulators recently reversed course. But the trend is the same across the nation, as electricity supplies are increasingly controlled by companies that do not operate under the oversight of state regulators. 
These companies build power plants only where it is most profitable -- and not necessarily where they are most needed. And unlike the old days of regulation, state governments cannot mandate the development of excess generating capacity for independent producers, or the use of a varied mix of energy sources, instead relying on the marketplace to anticipate power needs and fuel supplies. 
"Market forces were supposed to discipline the market better than what regulators could do," said Ken Rose, a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University. "But if market forces are weak, or somebody has market power, there's a tremendous ability of suppliers to control the price, or at least influence it, and not a lot of recourse for the state, because power plants are now out of their jurisdiction."
Instead, he said, it falls to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to fix a broken market -- the commission has engaged in a running battle with California officials who feel it has not done enough to resolve the energy crisis.
Independent generators and other backers of deregulation -- President Bush among them -- say that market forces, allowed to operate freely, will ensure an adequate supply of power. Along with many analysts, they attribute California's problems mostly to a badly designed deregulation law -- unique to the nation's biggest state -- that left the utilities victims of a marketplace that invited price spikes and volatility.
The pro-deregulation forces say, too, that none of the many investigations into suspected market manipulation during the crisis have conclusively fingered the generators, for all of Governor Davis's castigating them as "profiteers."
But even if the mess in California is not repeated elsewhere, concerns remain that shifting so much generation into the hands of unregulated companies could expose other parts of the country to significant market disruptions. While about half the states have passed retail deregulation laws -- many of which will not become effective for several years -- there is an active wholesale market for electricity across the nation, and unregulated power generators have broken ground for new plants in many states.
Before the federal government began speeding up the deregulation of power production in the 1990's, planning for new plants was overseen by state public utility commissioners, who conducted hearings with testimony from industry and consumer groups. State regulators emphasized the need for excess generation capacity, guaranteeing utilities a predictable rate of profit, and they guided utilities to buy or generate power from varied fuels. Consequently, while coal is the largest source of generating fuel, natural gas, nuclear and hydro power together account for nearly as much.
In the new world of deregulation, generators are free to build whatever types of plant they want, and more than 90 percent of the plants that are currently planned will run on natural gas. Gas-fired plants are relatively inexpensive to build, cleaner burning than coal-fired operations, and -- at least until the run-up in natural gas prices began last year -- cheaper to operate. 
But consumer groups and some big industrial power users worry that the generators are placing too many eggs in a volatile basket. Annual natural gas use by electric power generators could triple over the next 20 years, to more than 11 trillion cubic feet, according to the Department of Energy. That would consume about 60 percent of the current annual gas production in the United States -- output that also is used for industrial processes and home heating and cooking.
Even if there is enough natural gas, some in the industry question whether the nation will have the pipeline and storage capacity to get it where it needs to go. Tight supplies of natural gas have played a big role in California's problems -- a factor magnified after a pipeline explosion last August curtailed the flow of gas for months. Gas prices in California recently soared as high as $60 per million British thermal units -- six times the price elsewhere -- partly because of transportation constraints.
"The bigger issue is the infrastructure, the ability to transfer and store gas," said Craig Mataczynski, president of N.R.G.'s North American operations. 
The company, which was partly spun off last year from Xcel Energy Inc., plans to add about 35,000 megawatts of generating capacity to its current 15,000 megawatts in the next five years, mostly in the United States. But in contrast to competitors, about one-third of the N.R.G. plants will be coal fired, with the others able to switch between natural gas and oil, Mr. Mataczynski said. 
While the California crisis has created a reaction of sorts against the generators -- companies like Dynegy and Reliant Energy, both of Houston, and Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C. -- it is unlikely to greatly curtail their expansion. President Bush, whose Texas financial backers include companies profiting from the situation in California, has made it plain he is unlikely to impose caps on the price of wholesale power or other restraints that generators oppose. Yesterday, Mr. Bush's top economic advisers said that the federal government should let California solve its own power problem.
Instead, Mr. Bush has proposed several initiatives to spur the electric power industry: opening protected land in the West to drilling for natural gas, investing in cleaner-burning coal-fired plants, and easing regulatory burdens on pipeline and power plant operators. 
At the state level, there are signs of retreat from deregulation. Of the two dozen states that still work on the old model of monopoly utilities with regulated rates and guaranteed profits, at least four have indicated they may rethink any moves toward open energy markets. 
But at the wholesale level, deregulation is flourishing. Industry officials estimate that close to 3 billion megawatt-hours of electricity -- 1 megawatt-hour is enough to power 1,000 average homes for an hour -- changed hands on the wholesale power market last year, with giant traders, including Enron, taking a tiny piece of each transaction. Yesterday, Enron, based in Houston, reported that operating profits in its wholesale energy business tripled in the fourth quarter, to $777 million.
Independent generators, meanwhile, are grabbing a fast-growing share of the power market. During the first nine months of last year, nonutility producers generated 20.3 percent of the electricity consumed in the United States, compared with 10.6 percent in 1997, according to the Department of Energy. And that percentage will keep growing, as utilities continue to sell power plants to unregulated companies and independent power producers build more and more plants.
Under old-fashioned state regulation, utilities were given financial incentives -- or otherwise were forced -- to maintain surplus capacity, just in case it was needed. But deregulation has greatly reduced that tendency, leaving most power producers with smaller reserves, said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a California energy economist.
This is part of the trend to break up vertically integrated industries and operate with leaner inventories, Mr. Verleger said. "Electric utilities used to be required to hold 15 percent reserve capacity, but this inventory has been wiped out," he said. "No one has the responsibility to hold extra capacity." It is when peaks in demand sap scarce supply that prices soar in deregulated power markets.
Rattled by the mess in California, consumer advocates have other concerns, such as how the nation's electric transmission grid will be maintained and improved once the federal government completes turning control of the grid over to independent regional authorities. They also worry about whether the marketplace will move quickly enough to avert shortages, or whether other states will, like California, be caught short.
"The concern we have is whether, while we wait for those market forces to work, consumers either suffer through periods of high prices or shortages of electricity," said Janee Briesemeister, a utility analyst for Consumers Union in Austin, Tex. 
Regulated utilities, she said, "had a responsibility to ensure that there was enough power to meet the demand."
"But when you throw that open to the market," she added, "the market doesn't respond to predictions about how much power is needed. It responds to concerns about how much they can earn."
Power generators say they are responding vigorously to the nation's power needs -- and not just in California, where 9 plants are under construction and 22 more are in the regulatory pipeline. 
Nationwide, nonutility generators have announced plans for more than 250,000 megawatts of new capacity, though estimates in the industry are that in the next decade closer to half that amount will be built -- still a huge addition to today's total of more than 700,000 megawatts.
But executives at these companies warn that efforts to cap wholesale electricity prices or otherwise restrain them will curtail construction, hurting consumers in the long run. Such talk, Mr. Mataczynski of N.R.G. said, "certainly prevents positive solutions from being proposed."

HEADLINE: No Charges After Inquiry Of Pataki Ally 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Manhattan district attorney yesterday closed a long-running investigation into whether Charles A. Gargano, the state's top economic development official, had done favors for political contributors and said that he would file no charges against Mr. Gargano.
 District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau had never formally announced the inquiry of Mr. Gargano, who oversaw billions of dollars in economic development deals as chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. But its existence was widely known and hung like a dark cloud over Mr. Gargano for the last two years. 
 Although Mr. Gargano was never charged with anything, the investigation appeared to cost him a top post in George W. Bush's presidential campaign, just as he was packing the photographs on the walls of his office on Third Avenue in preparation for that job.
The inquiry began with an examination of spending by one part of Mr. Gargano's agency, and later broadened to focus on Mr. Gargano's role in nearly every aspect of its work.
Mr. Gargano, a former construction industry executive who had risen to prominence in Republican circles because of his prowess as a fund-raiser, had consistently maintained that the investigation would not turn up any wrongdoing.
Yesterday, the district attorney's office released a terse statement saying, "No criminal charges will be filed in connection with the two-year investigation."
Prosecutors would not elaborate on their decision to end the inquiry.
"Chairman Gargano is gratified by District Attorney Morgenthau's decision," said Maura Gallucci, his spokeswoman. "He has always been confident that there was no basis for any action to be taken."
With the investigation now behind him, Mr. Gargano seems poised to return to the prominence he once enjoyed as a close aide to Mr. Pataki and a leading Republican fund-raiser. It was Mr. Gargano who led the effort to raise more than $14 million to finance Governor Pataki's victory over Mario M. Cuomo.
"Charlie Gargano has been the premier economic development director in America, helping Governor Pataki create more private sector jobs than at any time in the history of this state," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the Mr. Pataki. "No one's better at it."
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Gargano were together yesterday in Niagara Falls, where they announced a plan to bring the Times Square development model to that city's beleaguered downtown.
The district's attorney's investigation of Mr. Gargano began in 1999 as an inquiry into whether agency officials misspent funds from annual receptions to honor Italian-Americans. It initially revolved around Paolo Palumbo, an old friend of Mr. Gargano's, whom he had appointed to be deputy commissioner for international business. A former baker and professor of Italian literature at Fordham University, Mr. Palumbo arranged the Italian affairs and sometimes wrote Mr. Gargano's speeches.
Mr. Palumbo subsequently resigned from his $91,877-a-year state job in July, 1999, and agreed to plead guilty to a bribery charge. At the same time, Mr. Palumbo was also working with investigators.
Mr. Gargano told friends at the time that he felt that his old friend had betrayed his trust.
But within months, the inquiry had grown into a wide-ranging exploration of Mr. Gargano's role in a variety of economic development projects in Westchester, his involvement in the sale of state land to Republican contributors and the construction of his new home in the Hamptons. Investigators interviewed a dozen current and former staff members of the state agency and deluged the Empire State Development Corporation with subpoenas demanding cartons of documents, memos and e-mail messages.
While Mr. Gargano never went to work for the Bush campaign, he has remained head of the state development agency during the inquiry, and in recent months, he has resumed his high-profile role in state affairs.

PERSON: FELIX G. ROHATYN 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Ex-Ambassador Samples the Simple Life

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
FELIX G. ROHATYN professes not to miss any of the accouterments of an ambassador, not the palatial residence in Paris, not the servants and staff, and most of all, not the security detail. 
 "We went to the movies very little in Paris because of our security and because we always went to the head of the line," Mr. Rohatyn said. Now, he and his wife, Elizabeth, are back to waiting in line for movies and enjoying a simpler life -- simple for a wealthy financier who just spent four years as United States ambassador to France. 
 Mr. Rohatyn never was too comfortable with the trappings of power he had in Paris, he said, sitting in a modest office in his Fifth Avenue apartment. "I'm not sure it's a great idea to live like a colonial governor when you're representing the United States."
He and his wife share their apartment with a pair of Labrador retrievers, Noodles and Nobu, the latter named for one of their favorite restaurants in Manhattan. A plastic scoop near the elevator door reminds visitors that even the rich and famous have to clean up after their pets. (Of course, the apartment does overlook Central Park.)
"Coming back here and coming back to a lifestyle that is more basic is, in a way, kind of a liberating thing," he said, appearing casual in faded blue jeans and a pullover sweater. "I'm beginning to try to see what kind of a life I want to lead."
As an ambassador, he said, "there was a complete loss of privacy and a loss, although I battled it every day, of the control of my calendar."
For the first time in decades, Mr. Rohatyn, 72, is representing only himself. He does not intend to return to Wall Street by rejoining the Lazard investment bank, whose New York operations he managed before President Clinton chose him for an ambassadorship.
Instead, he is considering forming a small firm with a few associates to advise corporations on finance and strategy. He plans to serve as a director of the Comcast Corporation and a few other companies, and to work on some pet projects, including setting up a company to develop cancer-fighting drugs. In between, he will write for the Council on Foreign Relations and The New York Review of Books and will try to get his life story down on paper. 
He says writing his memoirs "is a difficult thing to do." Friends have advised him to start each day by filling three or four pages. He is obviously daunted by the challenge of recounting all he has done and seen in 40 years as an adviser to corporate executives, and as chairman of New York's Municipal Assistance Corporation during the city's financial crisis in the 1970's.
Mr. Rohatyn said his original entry into the world of finance was serendipitous. In 1949, after studying physics at Middlebury College in Vermont, he needed a summer job. He landed one at Lazard, where his duties included adding up the value of rich, elderly ladies' accounts. After serving in the Army during the Korean War, he returned to Lazard and stayed for four decades.
"I entered this business because I wasn't good enough to be a physicist," he recalled.
To write a "good book about what I have seen in my life" is one of his few unfulfilled ambitions, he said. 
MR. ROHATYN is secretive about the rest of his plans. He would not say which other corporate boards he planned to join, nor would he divulge the identity of the scientists involved in the drug-development venture.
He is happy to talk about his hope that he will have time to assist Teaching Matters, a nonprofit organization his wife founded to train New York public school teachers. The Rohatyns' charitable foundation provides funding for Teaching Matters. 
Mr. Rohatyn is less sanguine about what he sees as a troubling trend on Wall Street, the triumph of analysts who are willing to broadcast overly positive views on companies' stocks in hopes of landing financing business for their firms. From a distance, he said, he was appalled by the frenzied rush to market with the stocks of unprofitable dot-com companies.
After seeing that bubble inflate and burst, he said, "I kind of thought that maybe it was time for me to step aside. I have no interest at this stage of my life of looking for clients or chasing after business."
He did not rule out the possibility that he might serve as a sort of freelance adviser to corporate leaders. "I do believe there will always be a need for independent advice by serious people," he said. 
So when he met with President Clinton recently, he offered some: Run for mayor of New York. What better role for Mr. Clinton, he said, than chief executive of "the capital of the world."
Mr. Rohatyn said that Mr. Clinton laughed off the suggestion, saying it was too soon for him to think about his next move. But Mr. Rohatyn was not joking. Cities are on the rise, he said, gaining power and influence as hubs of global commerce. 
"If you take the position that New York is a global community, then what you need is somebody who is a global leader. It seems to be that Bill Clinton is a perfectly obvious choice," he said.
But, the consummate New Yorker was asked, would New Yorkers ever accept Bill Clinton of Hope, Ark., as one of their own? Oh, sure, Mr. Rohatyn said. "I think that, at heart, Bill Clinton is a New Yorker."

SIGN OF GERMAN SLOWDOWN

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Germany's Ifo business index fell for the seventh consecutive month in December, an indication that the economy, the biggest in Europe, was set to continue losing steam as concern remains about the global impact of the slowdown in the United States. 
The monthly index of business confidence from Ifo, Germany's biggest economic research institute, fell to 96.5 from 97.0 in November, broadly in line with the consensus forecast. Ifo said the data showed the slowdown in Germany was now more broadly based and would continue for some time. The index reached its lowest level since a reading of 96.0 in October 1999, after steadily slipping from a nine-year high of 102.0 in May.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Profit Warning From Dell Starts Week on Down Note

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday after Dell Computer warned that its profit would be hurt by a global economic slowdown, beginning a heavy week for corporate earnings on a dour note.
 Strength in the stocks of retailers and biotechnology companies helped cushion the broader market's slide. 
 "This is the blockbuster week, where the vast majority of earnings will come out, so people are pausing and are willing to take some profits" from the recent rally, said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Company. 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 12.47 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,757.91. It was weighed down by weakness in computer and software companies after Dell blamed a slower economy and sluggish computer demand for its poor earnings outlook.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 9.35 points, at 10,578.24, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.36 point, to 1,342.90.
The Dow was hampered by American Express, which fell $3.63, to $45. Although it posted a 12 percent jump in earnings, it warned that earnings growth this year would be at the low end of its current target because of weak financial markets and a slowing economy.
Dell, whose shares fell as low as $23.63, finished off just 13 cents, at $25.50. But it did nudge its rivals lower on worries that the softening global economy would also harm their profits.
I.B.M. lost $2.69, to $108.56, and Hewlett-Packard skidded $1.25, to $34.50. Compaq Computer dropped 68 cents, to $19.82; Gateway declined $2.24, to $21.45, and Apple Computer fell 25 cents, to $19.25.
"There's a little bit of caution, and it's warranted," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon & Ross. "We now have to sit back and say, 'is this a one-quarter phenomenon or are we going to get more earnings warnings at the end of the first quarter?' "
But despite the pall cast by Dell, the market has largely withstood bad news, as it did after recent warnings from other bellwether companies.
"We are beyond the stage where such announcements are going to shake it to its feet like they did a few months ago," said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar & Company, a New York-based brokerage firm and money management company.

Treasuries Move Lower
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates aggressively enough to spur the economy.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 16/32, to a price of 103 30/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.22 percent from 5.16 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 27/32, to 109 9/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.60 percent from 5.55 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: New Leadership in the Philippines 

 BODY:
President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines, ethically discredited and politically abandoned, spared his country needless turmoil over the weekend by yielding his office to Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. He should drop any plans to challenge the constitutionality of that transfer.
 Mrs. Arroyo's ascension gives Manila a fresh chance to address longstanding problems of political corruption and disappointing economic growth. This former American colony, once one of Southeast Asia's richest nations, is now one of its poorest. Twice in the past 15 years its people have courageously taken to the streets to turn out failed leaders. They deserve better governance and a better life. 
 Like Corazon Aquino, who succeeded Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, Mrs. Arroyo was carried to office by a wave of demonstrations and military defections from the ruling camp. Mr. Marcos was a venal dictator. Mr. Estrada's failings were limited to cronyism and incompetence. 
Mrs. Arroyo comes to the job well prepared. The daughter of a former Philippine president, she studied economics in the United States. She served in Mrs. Aquino's administration, won election as a senator and then, in 1998, was elected vice president. 
She must make clear that business interests will no longer be able to buy political influence and government contracts through campaign contributions to top legislators. Contracts should be submitted to open bidding. Independent judges should be named and insulated from political pressures. It would set a healthy example if prosecutors were allowed to follow through on the plans they announced yesterday to pursue criminal corruption charges against Mr. Estrada. 
With wise leadership, the Philippines, a country of more than 80 million people with a favorable geographic location, charter membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and historic ties to the United States, could again become an economic leader in Southeast Asia. It could also become a positive example to its less democratic neighbors, like Vietnam and Myanmar. That is the formidable challenge awaiting Mrs. Arroyo.

HEADLINE: THE NEW ADMINISTRATION: THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT; 
Ashcroft Leaned Right, Then Center

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Early in Missouri's 1984 Republican primary for governor, the front-runner, Gene McNary, coined a nickname for his rival, State Attorney General John Ashcroft, the straight-laced, strongly conservative, Yale-educated son of a Pentecostal preacher. "I was the warrior," Mr. McNary recently recalled, "and he was the poet."
 But then the poet started throwing punches. In commercials, mailings and speeches, Mr. Ashcroft attacked Mr. McNary for having supported a costly school desegregation plan for St. Louis. The attack, which analysts say badly hurt Mr. McNary among rural white voters, helped Mr. Ashcroft score an easy primary victory, his first step to becoming Missouri's 50th governor. 
 Mr. Ashcroft's sharp-edged -- critics say polarizing -- campaign was a departure for voters more accustomed to the genteel style of the state's senior Republican, then-Senator John C. Danforth. But if Mr. Ashcroft's campaign seemed to veer right, his policies in office frequently did not. To the surprise of many, he often governed from the political center he had professed to disdain. 
Three times, he endorsed Democratic-backed tax increases for roads and schools. He signed legislation increasing penalties for crimes motivated by bigotry and raised spending on legal services for the poor. And his legislative agendas relied heavily on bipartisan ideas, from economic development to higher pay for teachers to tougher penalties for criminals.
In part, Mr. Ashcroft's moves to the center were the result of working with a Democratic-controlled Legislature throughout his two terms. But in part, they also reflected his governing style, which people in both parties described as cautious, pragmatic and acutely sensitive to public opinion.
"He's one of the most clever politicians I ever met," said Chris Kelly, a state judge and former Democratic state senator. "He knew the pulse of the electorate. And he didn't become public about positions unless he thought he could win. He was not a risk taker."
With contentious confirmation hearings over President Bush's nomination of Mr. Ashcroft to be attorney general expected to conclude this week, many people are looking to his tenure in Missouri for clues about how he would run the Justice Department. Many Democrats say the record suggests that Mr. Ashcroft would not enforce federal laws he opposes, like one intended to protect abortion clinics from violence.
Indeed, Mr. Ashcroft was a die-hard believer in limited government who frequently vetoed bills he considered overly broad or expensive. A fundamentalist Christian, he advocated outlawing most abortions, banned alcohol from the Governor's Mansion and declined to dance at his own inaugural balls. And he formed close alliances with Christian conservatives, anti-abortion groups and the National Rifle Association.
But many Missouri politicians, including Democrats, say that despite his strong beliefs, Mr. Ashcroft played by the book, even when he disliked the rules. As attorney general, for example, he ruled that religious literature could not be distributed at public schools and that federal money could not be used for teaching parochial school students, though he supported both policies.
And when term limits ended his tenure as governor in 1992, the most common criticism against Mr. Ashcroft was not that he had been a firebrand conservative who tried to dismantle state government, but a careful administrator more adept at blocking Democratic initiatives than twisting arms to advance his own.
"There were people to the right of me who thought he had missed an opportunity to do big things," said Woody Cozad, a Kansas City lawyer who is an ally of Mr. Ashcroft and a former chairman of the state Republican Party. "They thought he was too cautious."
Missouri political analysts say Mr. Ashcroft's politics are best understood by looking at his roots in Springfield, a city of unpretentious bungalows, farm supply stores and factories in the Ozark foothills of southwest Missouri, the state's Bible Belt and most-Republican region.
The city was the national headquarters of the Assemblies of God church, and Mr. Ashcroft's father was president of the church's liberal arts school, Evangel College.
Mr. Ashcroft lost a 1972 campaign for Congress and a 1974 race for state auditor. But he went on to win five statewide races: two for attorney general, two for governor and one for United States Senate. In his re-election campaign for governor in 1988, his winning percentage was, at 64 percent, the highest for a Missouri governor since the Civil War.
But he narrowly lost his 2000 Senate campaign to Gov. Mel Carnahan, who had died a few weeks before the election. Mr. Carnahan's widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat.
At the heart of those winning races were three factors, political analysts say: Mr. Ashcroft's hard-driven but folksy campaign style, his ability to win support from socially conservative Democrats and his powerful appeal to rural white voters.
A self-trained pianist and gospel singer who wrote and recorded scores of songs, Mr. Ashcroft spent many weekends singing at churches across the state, building a following of fundamentalist ministers and their congregations. 
Missouri voters also seemed to like the tight-fisted way he managed the state's finances. He became well-known for repairing his own cars to save money, and voters seemed to expect him to bring the same ethic to state government, where he cut programs to help create rainy-day funds and budget surpluses.
But Mr. Ashcroft also relied on big turnouts and deep support from the overwhelmingly white rural and suburban areas of the state, particularly in southwest Missouri. Democrats assert that Mr. Ashcroft's staunch opposition to court-ordered school desegregation plans was part of an effort to appeal to those voters.
In the late 1970's and early 1980's, federal judges had held the state liable for segregated schools in St. Louis and Kansas City, and they ordered it to help pay for busing, school construction and other improvements, which cost the state tens of millions of dollars a year.
As attorney general, Mr. Ashcroft led the state's legal efforts to overturn those rulings. And as governor, he continued to denounce them in harsh terms, accusing the judge in the Kansas City case of trying "to command unlimited resources from taxpayers throughout Missouri."
Mr. Ashcroft's supporters say he did not oppose integration, just the court-ordered plans to achieve it, which he believed unfairly siphoned money from other parts of the state. "He had a duty to defend the state of Missouri, and all of the state of Missouri," said Chip Robertson, who was a top aide to Mr. Ashcroft in the attorney general's office.
But Democrats, and some Republicans, contend that Mr. Ashcroft's unyielding stand prevented him from negotiating a settlement that might have ended the case, saving state money. And while few people accused him of being racist, many said they thought his strenuous opposition to desegregation inflamed anti-black and anti-urban attitudes among white voters, who make up about 90 percent of Missouri's electorate.
"Ashcroft wasn't going to get many votes out of St. Louis and Kansas City," said David Leuthold, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Missouri. "So he could go to all the other areas of the state and say, I've been fighting for you. You're getting ripped off by the courts."
Many polls showed that Missouri voters tended to agree with Mr. Ashcroft on school desegregation. And his strong opposition to gun control and abortion, and equally strong support for fiscal restraint and limited government, were also well within the mainstream of Missouri politics, political analysts say. 
"When you run for office in Missouri, babies, guns and taxes are the issues," said Richard Hardy, a political scientist at the University of Missouri who has been active in Republican Party politics. "I think he reflected the majority of Missourians when he advanced those causes."
Despite his popularity with voters, Mr. Ashcroft was not well liked in the Legislature. Democrats accustomed to the more gregarious personality of Mr. Ashcroft's predecessor, Christopher S. Bond, were put off by what they considered Mr. Ashcroft's more reserved -- some said sanctimonious -- personality.
"When he came into a room for negotiations, you could have given him a lectern," said Attorney General Jay Nixon, a Democrat who served in the State Senate during Mr. Ashcroft's tenure. "There wasn't much interaction."
Moderate Republicans said they found Mr. Ashcroft respectful of their views even when they disagreed on issues like abortion. But some of them also raised a concern voiced by Democrats: would Mr. Ashcroft, with the support of a Republican president and Congressional leadership, pursue a more aggressively conservative agenda in the Justice Department?
"When he says he'll uphold Roe v. Wade, I believe him," said State Senator Betty Sims, a Republican from St. Louis who supports abortion rights. "But he's not playing alone, and that's what frightens me."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 23 about John Ashcroft's public career in Missouri referred incorrectly to his religious denomination. It is the Assemblies of God -- a Pentecostal church, not fundamentalist.
The article also misstated Mr. Ashcroft's position on a federal law to combat violence against abortion clinics. He has said he is in favor of it, not against it. 
The article misstated the title of Chris Kelly, a former state legislator who praised Mr. Ashcroft's political abilities. He was a state representative, not a state senator.

HEADLINE: Ousted Manila Leader Says He Yielded Just Temporarily 

BYLINE:  By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: MANILA, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Joseph Estrada, forced from the Philippine presidency last week, indicated today that he had yielded power only as a temporary measure and appeared to be creating a basis for legal challenge to his ouster. 
 Congressional leaders have expressed concern that Mr. Estrada, whom prosecutors accused of corruption, may be preparing to file a last-ditch legal action seeking to reverse his removal. The Supreme Court declared him unfit for office, and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who had been vice president, was sworn in as his replacement on Saturday. 
 Mr. Estrada, who never officially resigned, fled the Presidential Palace after most of his cabinet and military leaders denounced him and tens of thousands of protesters threatened to come after him. When he left office, he issued a statement saying that while he was stepping aside, he had "strong and serious doubts about the legality and constitutionality" of Mrs. Arroyo's installation as president.
Today, a letter from Mr. Estrada dated Saturday was delivered to the Senate president, Aquilino Pimentel. In the letter, Mr. Estrada contends that he was only temporarily incapacitated and turned over power to Mrs. Arroyo to serve in an acting capacity. A similar letter was sent to several members of the House of Representatives.
"This letter appears to be the basis for a constitutional challenge," Mr. Pimentel said in an interview. "We could very well be headed for a major constitutional crisis if Mr. Estrada decides to contest his removal."
In a television interview on Sunday, Mr. Estrada's son, Joseph, said his father had "not resigned the presidency," and he strongly intimated that Manila had not seen the last of Mr. Estrada, a former movie star who was very popular with the poor and working class. For now, Mr. Estrada remains secluded in his private mansion on the outskirts of the capital, and it is unclear whether he will seek to return to power. 
But he has raised serious questions about the legitimacy of the new presidency just as Mrs. Arroyo is assembling a cabinet, formulating policy initiatives, and moving into the Presidential Palace, where she lived when her father was president in the early 1960's. 
Many foreign governments and organizations, including the United States and the United Nations, have expressed support for Mrs. Arroyo, a 53-year-old economist, who has vowed to crack down on corruption, strengthen the country's sagging economy and reduce poverty. Financial markets rose sharply today in reaction to Mr. Estrada's removal. 
Aides to Mrs. Arroyo dismissed the prospect that Mr. Estrada would initiate a legal challenge or that such an effort would succeed. They said the Supreme Court chief justice, Hilario Davide, administered the oath of office to Mrs. Arroyo after the 12-member court unanimously declared the presidency vacant. They said they had done so because Mr. Estrada was not able to carry out his duties after he lost the support of his top officials and the military. 
In an effort to head off any constitutional challenge, the Supreme Court approved a resolution today upholding its decision to install Mrs. Arroyo. But the court said its resolution was "without prejudice to any justifiable case that may be filed by a proper party." 
Some legal scholars and legislators said the Supreme Court had erred in installing Mrs. Arroyo as president because succession under the Philippine Constitution requires a sitting president to submit his or her resignation in writing to both Houses of Congress, a step that Mr. Estrada did not take. 
Mrs. Arroyo, a bitter political enemy of Mr. Estrada, acknowledged today that she had come to power under unusual circumstances. 
"The path that brought me here today has not been an easy one, and I did not take that path alone," she said at a flag-raising ceremony. "I came here riding on a wave created by millions of people making their voices heard above the dark confusion of crisis and confrontation."
A high-ranking Western diplomat based in Manila said that Mr. Estrada had raised legitimate questions about succession and that in hindsight, "it could be argued that constitutional principles were disregarded in the name of people power." But the diplomat expressed doubt that the events of last week would be reversed on legal appeal. 
Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the change of power in Manila did not enhance democracy because it was done outside the Constitution. "I would have preferred that Estrada could be removed in a constitutional way in the Senate," said Mr. Lee, the 77-year-old founder of the modern city-state of Singapore, a democracy which nonetheless stifled dissent. "So I don't think it was a plus for the democratic system." 
Some political experts speculated that Mr. Estrada was declaring that he remained head of state to keep his presidential immunity from prosecution.
Prosecutors have begun a new criminal inquiry into charges that Mr. Estrada pocketed millions of dollars in excise taxes and bribes from gambling syndicates while in office. The charges were similar to those brought against him in a Senate impeachment trial that collapsed last week, leading to the protests and defections that culminated in his downfall.

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Warns Iraq on Weapons Programs 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
The Bush administration warned Iraq today to honor its agreements to destroy its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, but the White House said it was too soon to say what steps the new administration would take to ensure Baghdad's compliance. 
 Responding to a report today that Iraq had rebuilt a series of factories long suspected of producing chemical and biological weapons, the new White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, "The president expects Saddam Hussein to live up to the agreements that he's made with the United Nations, especially regarding the elimination of weapons of mass destruction." 
 But when asked how and when the administration would help resume international inspections of suspected weapons sites and factories, Mr. Fleischer said, "I'm not prepared to address that today, but we will." 
A decade after Mr. Bush's father led a coalition that ousted Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait, Iraq remains one of the most daunting foreign policy problems that former President Bill Clinton has left his successor. 
Mr. Bush and his national security advisers -- including Gen. Colin L. Powell, now secretary of state, and Vice President Dick Cheney, who both confronted Iraq as top defense officials 10 years ago -- have talked tough about containing President Hussein.
But as they enter office, it is not clear whether they have any better options than Mr. Clinton had. International support for tough enforcement of sanctions has waned, while Mr. Hussein has managed to ease his diplomatic isolation, making it difficult to re-energize sanctions, as General Powell has suggested.
If Mr. Bush pursues a more aggressive strategy, including military force, the new administration is likely to find few allies, despite evidence that Iraq has resumed covert work on dangerous weapons. 
As a condition of ending the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Iraq agreed to destroy its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, as well as the production of long-range missiles to deliver to such weapons. 
But since the middle of 1998, Iraq has barred any meaningful inspections by teams of United Nations experts, who since the end of the gulf war had ferreted out and destroyed large quantities of weapons and uncovered secret programs to create biological and chemical weapons. 
"The challenge is larger than a lot of people suspect," said Representative Porter Goss, a Florida Republican who heads the House Intelligence Committee. "To say we've lost our eyes and ears in Iraq is true." 
Clearly, constraining Mr. Hussein's weapons programs is at the core of the new administration's policy. "His only tool, the only thing he can scare us with are those weapons of mass destruction, and we have to hold him to account," General Powell said last week. 
Mr. Bush and his top advisers have vowed to reinvigorate the economic sanctions against Iraq, convince skeptical allies of their value, and somehow spare Iraqi children from bearing the brunt of their effect. 
"The most important thing is to maintain the core sanctions, the key sanctions that do make it more difficult and prevent Iraq from rebuilding its weapons programs, particularly its weapons of mass destruction," Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said today. 
But even some of Mr. Bush's own advisers question this approach. "Re-energizing sanctions is a mistake," said Richard Perle, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Bush during the campaign. "Ten years later, they're an obvious failure." 
The new administration also supports Iraqi opposition whose goal is to topple Mr. Hussein.
The Clinton administration provided only tepid support to the Iraqi opposition. Although President Clinton signed a law in 1998 authorizing $98 million in military aid and equipment, the administration provided very little in the end and explicitly refused to provide any weapons.
Under pressure, the Pentagon began providing some direct military training to Iraqi dissidents and opposition leaders in the fall of 1999. Since then, the Pentagon has given courses to 90 members of the Iraqi National Congress -- including 27 at a public affairs seminar in London last summer and 43 who went to a one-week course on war crimes in November at the Defense Institute of International Studies in Newport, R.I. Training continues, but it does not involve combat-related skills.
Senior military commanders opposed giving much military aid to the Iraqi groups, warning that they were too weak and fractious to pose a serious threat to Mr. Hussein's rule. 
The Bush administration would be committed to the opposition's cause, aides say. "What we have in mind is making it clear to Saddam and the world that we're in favor of seeing this regime change," Mr. Perle said. "We'll support freedom fighters who are prepared to engage in a long-term struggle." 
The Bush administration has not ruled out bombing suspected weapons sites as a last resort. "If, in fact, Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, we'd have to give very serious consideration to military action," Mr. Cheney said in a debate on Oct. 5. 
As they departed, Clinton administration officials defended their policies. Walter B. Slocombe, who stepped down last week as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, said of Mr. Hussein, "I don't want to claim he hasn't made progress, but he's still in the box."

HEADLINE: THE NEW ADMINISTRATION: THE EDUCATION ISSUE; 
Education Plan By Bush Shows New Consensus

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
As his first major policy proposal, President Bush plans to present an education package today whose theme, "leave no child behind," echoes the decade-old motto of the Children's Defense Fund.
 That a Republican president and one of the nation's premier liberal groups share a slogan reflects the recent narrowing of the education debate to focus almost exclusively on the plight of poor, minority children in inner-city schools. 
 From social promotion to summer school, standards and accountability to universal preschool and after-school programs -- even in the contentious struggle over school choice -- the young faces being used to sell virtually every education reform proposal these days tend to be black and brown.
For Mr. Bush, the poverty-focused education program represents his best hope for bipartisan backing, and could even win him support from a campaign adversary, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. Page A14. 
The new emphasis is a stark change from the 1980's, when educators and policy makers fretted over the fate of even America's best schools in international competition, and it is in striking contrast to other domestic policy issues, like health care, in which middle class concerns drive the debate. 
With corporate leaders dissatisfied about the quality of the labor pool helping to steer the discussion, talk from years past about experimental curriculums and individual portfolios has been overshadowed by a bottom-line approach stressing basic skills, tests and accountability -- all aimed at the neediest students in impoverished urban districts.
"The whole discussion is an equity discussion," said Diane Ravitch, the education historian. "The tenor of the discussion is: Do charter schools help poor kids? Do vouchers help poor kids? Is state testing good or bad for poor kids? How can we design a system that increases equity?"
On education, it seems, the political spectrum is collapsing into near consensus, with the goal of helping a constituency long represented by liberals using methods -- competition, accountability and a focus on fundamentals -- that are conservative at their core. Disputes remain over whether to expand taxpayer-financed vouchers for private-school tuition and over the power of teachers' unions, but broad swaths of common ground exist in between. 
Mr. Bush plans to unveil this morning a package that includes early literacy programs, annual assessment comparing progress among racial groups and an escape hatch that would make federal money portable for families in failing schools.
Counterproposals by Democrats and Republicans also aim to close the achievement gap between poor and middle-class students through accountability measures like standardized tests, school report cards and pay incentives.
The shift to focus on the poor has its roots in the decade-old push for high-stakes testing in schools nationwide, as Americans for the first time expect all students to master a college preparatory curriculum. With the new tests have come reams of data about individual school performance, and the disquieting discovery that the achievement gap between white and minority pupils, while narrowed from several decades ago, has begun to widen again.
"There is the 'all' word -- that's a brand-new word in this whole discussion," said Marshall S. Smith, a Stanford education professor who was deputy secretary in the Clinton education department. "That word 'all' applies a lot more to poor and minority kids, and limited English proficiency kids."
While many liberals who have been advocating for the poor for decades welcome the new voices to the conversation, others are skeptical about their sincerity. Some question whether highlighting the failures of urban schools is just laying the groundwork for disbanding the public school system; others worry that the focus on education ignores the more intractable underlying problems of poverty, discrimination and family dysfunction. Complaints abound, too, that parents and teachers of the poor are rarely consulted.
"Most policy makers don't have either any interest in or clarity about what it is they'd really do with urban schools," said Michael D. Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, which represents the nation's 60 largest urban districts. "Sometimes the conversation will start around the obvious needs, in this case poor kids in urban and rural communities, and that becomes the rationale for freeing up money that is then spent on somebody else."
Emeral A. Crosby, a Detroit high school principal for 30 years, was more cynical, suggesting a profit motive for those running charter schools, designing tests or putting computers in impoverished schools.
"Right now there's a lot of money in saying you're going to help the poor," he said. "Salesmen are good at this. They're going to tell me how this is going to benefit me, whatever it is that they're selling, but really what they want to do is sell me something, whether I need it or not, to improve their quality of life."
To be sure, the education debate has always emphasized the disadvantaged, particularly at the federal level. From the desegregation of schools in the 1950's to the Great Society programs of the 1960's, the bulk of federal attention and money has focused on the needy.
But for decades, conservatives talked of dismantling such federal programs, not proffering different ways to help the same population. More recently, the debate was shaped by the 1983 report, "A Nation at Risk," which consciously emphasized excellence over equity and criticized schools with a broad brush rather than singling out those serving the poor.
"We have, in effect, been committing an act of unthinking, unilateral educational disarmament," the report warned. "We must dedicate ourselves to the reform of our educational system for the benefit of all -- old and young alike, affluent and poor, majority and minority."
Similarly, the standards movement that inaugurated this era of bipartisanship on education a decade ago was originally seen as something for everybody -- all students pushed to higher levels. But as new tests have taken hold, attention has fallen on those who are failing, and there is a growing middle-class backlash against schools' stripping their curriculums and resembling test-prep factories.
Now, suburban priorities like art and music, special education and high school design often get pushed aside in the national debate by the inner-city plagues of illiteracy and high dropout rates. Even universal problems like the impending teacher shortage are typically couched in concerns for the poor, where they are most acute.
"The poor children have advocates all over the place; the upper class places their children in private schools," said Shelley Joy Tellez, the mother of a ninth grader in Mesa, Ariz., who runs an anti-testing Web site, www.stopaimsnow.org. "The middle-class kids, I think they get lost in the wash."
On most issues, politicians cater to white, middle-class, suburban concerns because that is where the votes are. But with education, many such residents tell pollsters they are satisfied with their own schools, yet worried about the inner city, so it makes political sense to frame the debate that way. In addition, poor children inspire more sympathy than other subjects of ambitious social programs, like welfare mothers, drug addicts, the unemployed, or veterans of the criminal justice system.
"Some care as a matter of compassion; increasingly, they care as a matter of competitiveness," said Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League. "A lousy education is costing the business community billions of dollars."
Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, agreed. "We can't afford to have a large segment of the population left behind," she said. That Ms. Feldman is echoing the slogan of President Bush, whose candidacy she fought fiercely, is symbolic of the broad agreement on major education issues from all corners of the political landscape, as Republicans seize an issue long dominated by Democrats.
This weekend, a Democratic donor sponsored a dinner for the new Secretary of Education, Roderick R. Paige, and there were no clear aisles as people from both sides mingled around the vodka fountain. "We may have come on different ships," Mr. Paige said, quoting former Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas, "but we are in the same boat now."
Look at Christopher T. Cross and Jack Jennings. For years, they dueled on Capitol Hill, staff directors of the House education committee for opposing parties; today, Mr. Cross is chairman of the board of Mr. Jennings's Center on Education Policy in Washington. 
The Wall Street Journal's editorial page courts Howard Fuller, a former black power radical. Chester E. Finn Jr., a Reagan administration alumnus, and Amy T. Wilkins, a former labor organizer who now works with a Washington group devoted to underserved pupils, often share the same side of the table. 
"The us against them in education politics today is outsiders across the political spectrum versus people with a direct interest in the status quo," Mr. Finn said. 
Earlier this month, at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, a Who's Who of education's right-wing met for two days, and virtually every conversation, Ms. Ravitch said, turned on the question of "how can we benefit the poor?"
Referring to that liberal bastion on the other coast, she added, "I think the same discussion would be held at the Harvard school of education."

HEADLINE: THE NEW ADMINISTRATION: THE PRESIDENT; 
BUSH ACTS TO HALT OVERSEAS SPENDING TIED TO ABORTION

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI and MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush moved today to deny federal aid to overseas groups that provide abortion counseling or otherwise help women obtain abortions, using his first full day of work in the Oval Office to reinstate restrictions that had been in place under the previous Bush and Reagan administrations.
 Mr. Bush's action reversed the Clinton policy on aid for international family planning groups, which Bill Clinton had instituted in his first days in the White House. 
 And it came on the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that first established a constitutional right to abortion, a day that brought busloads of opponents of legal abortion here for a protest around the Washington Monument. Page A16. 
"It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad," Mr. Bush wrote in an executive memorandum to the Agency for International Development, which administers and monitors family planning aid to overseas groups.
In a statement released along with the memorandum this evening, the White House made clear that Mr. Bush was not proposing any reduction in the $425 million in aid allocated for overseas family planning for this fiscal year, but was simply placing restraints on how it was used.
The change in abortion policy quickly diverted attention from the new administration's theme of the week, education, which had been chosen in part for its promise of creating the kind of bipartisan coalitions Mr. Bush may need to push legislation through a Congress narrowly divided along party lines.
And by wading into an especially divisive social issue, Mr. Bush seemed to be stepping on his other efforts today to reach out to Democrats and strike a harmonious tone.
Administration aides were, in fact, putting the finishing touches on a package of education proposals that they are expected to send to Congress on Tuesday, when Mr. Bush is also scheduled to meet at the White House with groups of Democratic lawmakers to discuss education.
The abortion debate also drew attention away from the introduction in the Senate of legislation for the sort of huge tax cut that Mr. Bush promised in the presidential campaign.
Advocates of legal abortion immediately questioned whether, with the abortion memorandum, Mr. Bush was showing himself to be much more conservative than he had in his campaign and whether it was part of a broader assault on abortion rights.
"He had a moderate demeanor throughout the campaign," said Kate Michelman, the president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. But today's action -- along with the selection of John Ashcroft, a committed foe of abortion, as attorney general -- suggested that Mr. Bush "intends to use his powers to restrict a woman's right to choose," she added.
But Mr. Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Bush was simply following through on a position and philosophy that he enunciated clearly in the campaign and that was in line with the thinking of a majority of Americans.
"I think there's, frankly, widespread bipartisan support that there should not be taxpayer money used to promote abortion," Mr. Fleischer said at his first briefing as the White House press secretary.
The day featured many other firsts, as well as a noticeable degree of chaos, as the people working in the new administration moved into their White House offices, struggled with their White House computers and digested their new obligations. Their morning began in the East Room with a swearing-in ceremony, at which Mr. Bush emphasized the high ethical standards he expected his staff to adhere to.
"We are all accountable to the law and to the American people," Mr. Bush told them. That televised statement, along with subsequent televised comments in which Mr. Bush said that "the country is pleased that it's time to move on," carried hints of reproach for Mr. Clinton's conduct in his presidency.
Mr. Bush held a series of meetings at the White House intended to build support for his legislative agenda. He had lunch there with Republican Congressional leaders, including Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. 
Later, he sat down in the White House with former Democratic lawmakers and other party elders. Mr. Bush used his brief public remarks at that meeting to insist, as he had in his inaugural remarks and in preinaugural speeches, that he was less interested in party affiliation than in progress on crucial issues.
"This administration is going to seek the good in everybody and find that ability to come together for the good of the country as well," Mr. Bush said at the meeting. It was attended by Richard Moe, a former chief of staff to Vice President Walter Mondale; Robert Strauss, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee; Jody Powell, a former press secretary to President Jimmy Carter; William H. Gray III, a former congressman from Pennsylvania who is now president of the United Negro College Fund; and former Senators John Glenn of Ohio and Paul Simon of Illinois.
"My feeling is, the president is going to reach out," Mr. Simon said as he left the White House late this afternoon. "Strangely, the 50-50 situation in the Senate may lead to greater cooperation between the parties."
But there were reminders today, as Senate Democrats spelled out their own priorities, of some of the fault lines and tensions that Mr. Bush will confront.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said Democrats believed strongly that "any tax cut must be affordable and fiscally responsible." For many Congressional Democrats, that means a far less sweeping reduction than proposed in the Bush plan, which essentially arrived on Capitol Hill today in the form of legislation introduced in the Senate. It called for a tax cut of roughly $1.6 trillion over 10 years.
There were also hints that Mr. Bush, the former Texas governor, was on legislative terrain less familiar and hospitable than what he was accustomed to.
After the lunch with Republican leaders, one, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, said, "We basically talked about how the Congress actually works -- not that we were teaching him, but talking to him about what we've been able to do over the last six years."
"What we've been able to do is different from what he's used to in Texas," Mr. DeLay added.
In a day with a flurry of unrelated developments, the White House also announced that Mr. Bush's first foreign trip would not be to Canada, the customary destination for many new presidents, but to Mexico.
Aides said that he would meet with the Mexican president, Vicente Fox, at Mr. Fox's ranch in San Cristobal, and that Mr. Bush might well be able to fit in a visit to his own ranch, in Crawford, Tex., then.
But all other business was eclipsed by the abortion memorandum, and Mr. Fleischer endured question after question about its timing so soon into the administration. Mr. Bush did not have to render a decision on the federal aid until Feb. 15. "This is something that he ran on, and so I don't think it's anything that's unexpected," Mr. Fleischer said.
But Mr. Bush seldom dwelled on abortion in his campaign, and even today, he seemed intent on striking a balance. He did not address the protesters here but instead passed along a statement, which a Republican congressman read aloud.
"The promises of our Declaration of Independence are not just for the strong, the independent or the healthy," the statement from Mr. Bush said. "They are for everyone -- including unborn children."
The memorandum Mr. Bush signed today reinstated a 1984 ban, issued by President Ronald Reagan and then maintained by Mr. Bush's father, on providing money for use by overseas groups that promote abortion. Mr. Clinton essentially suspended that ban, although the delivery of the money was halted late last year until Feb. 15, thus allowing a new president to decide what to do.
The $425 million affected by Mr. Bush's decision goes to an array of groups, like Planned Parenthood International and the Centre for Development and Population Activities, in addition to foreign governments. While many private groups would lose financing, the governments would not be bound by the edict.
Administration officials and abortion rights advocates said they could not immediately determine how the aid was divided between private groups and foreign governments, nor how many groups involved in abortion services would face a cutoff.

HEADLINE: THE NEW ADMINISTRATION: THE TAX PLAN; 
Bush's Proposal to Cut Taxes Is Swiftly Introduced in Senate

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Congress began considering President Bush's $1.6 trillion tax-cut proposal today, with a renegade Democrat joining a Republican in introducing the bill in the Senate and Democratic leaders saying they would insist that the package be scaled back.
 With a Republican in the White House, an economy that may or may not be faltering and a growing federal budget surplus, Republicans in Congress said that they were confident of passing a substantial tax cut this year and that it might even be bigger than the plan outlined by Mr. Bush during his presidential campaign. 
 Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a Republican, teamed with Senator Zell Miller of Georgia, a Democrat, to put Mr. Bush's plan into the legislative pipeline, with both senators predicting that it would attract considerable bipartisan support. 
Mr. Bush's plan would reduce all federal income tax rates, raise the child credit, give a break to married couples and repeal the federal tax on large estates. Most of its provisions would be phased in over the next five to eight years, though the new administration is considering accelerating the schedule to help give the economy an immediate lift.
Members of Congress are considering adding provisions like an expansion of individual retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement programs.
In the form proposed by Mr. Bush during the campaign, the plan would reduce taxes by $1.3 trillion over nine years, starting next year. Congress normally estimates tax cuts over 10 years, in this case starting next year and extending through 2011; by that yardstick, the Bush tax plan would be worth about $1.6 trillion.
Mr. Gramm acknowledged that the Bush plan as he introduced it was sure to be revised in coming weeks and months, both by Congress and by the new administration. 
But Mr. Gramm said he had consulted with the president, Vice President Dick Cheney and the new Treasury Secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, before deciding to introduce the bill now. And he was clearly delighted at having a Democrat to co-sponsor it, especially after years in which Republican efforts to cut taxes were thwarted by Bill Clinton.
"What we wanted to do, on a bipartisan basis, is to start the debate today," Mr. Gramm said. 
Mr. Gramm said that Republicans now expected the federal budget surplus for the next decade to be roughly $5.6 trillion, of which about $2.9 trillion would come from outside the Social Security program. The two parties have agreed not to use the part of the surplus generated by Social Security for tax cuts or new spending.
Mr. Miller, whose support could be critical to Republicans as they seek to steer the tax cut through a Senate split 50-50 between the two parties, was unapologetic for breaking with his party over Mr. Bush's plan.
"Right now, our taxes have never been higher," Mr. Miller said. "Right now, our surplus has never been greater. To me it's just plain common sense that you deal with the first by using the second." 
Mr. Bush discussed tax cuts today in his meeting at the White House with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate's Republican leader. Afterward, Mr. Hastert said he and Mr. Lott would work to complete something very close to Mr. Bush's plan as fast as possible. 
"We're going to work with the president to get it through both the House and the Senate the best we can and try to keep to the president's principles and parameters," Mr. Hastert said. 
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said the president would "fight for the package that he ran on."
No longer able to rely on a veto from the White House to back them up, Democrats in Congress said they would continue to press for a considerably smaller tax cut, with benefits primarily directed to low- and middle-income households.
"We are willing to negotiate," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate. "At the same time, we are committed to two fundamental principles. First, the bulk of the tax relief must go to middle-class working families, because they are the people who need tax relief most. Second, any tax cut must be affordable and fiscally responsible."
Mr. Daschle said Democrats had introduced their own package, including tax breaks for some married couples with two incomes, a cut in the estate tax and tax breaks for specific purposes like college tuition and the cost of long-term care for disabled and elderly family members.

HEADLINE: Administration Leaves Power Crisis in California's Hands 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush's top economic officials gathered today to deal with the threat of electricity blackouts and utility bankruptcies in California. But they decided that the federal government should let California solve its own power problem.
 The signal from the administration in its first working day in office contrasted with the more activist stance by the Clinton administration, which convened the parties involved in California's power crisis to try to hammer out a compromise that would ensure sufficient supplies of power at reasonable prices. That effort did not produce a solution before President Clinton left office on Saturday. 
 California's electricity reserves have fallen into crisis levels for seven days. The state avoided rolling blackouts today, but power officials warned that they were still at a Stage 3 electrical emergency and that at any time they might have no choice but to shut off power to homes, offices and factories in parts of the state.
The administration faces a deadline of Tuesday to decide whether to continue two emergency orders that require out-of-state companies to continue selling surplus electricity and natural gas to California. State utility companies and electricity officials are pressing Mr. Bush to extend the orders, which expire at midnight that day, arguing that the state's power shortage will become more precarious without federal help.
The California Independent System Operator, the agency that oversees the state's electrical supply, wrote a letter to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham urging an extension of the order, which mandates that electricity producers in nearby states sell their surplus to California. The letter called the order "critical to efforts to secure the energy supplies needed."
A California state electricity official said today that the order had helped California buy hundreds of megawatt hours of electricity on the wholesale market -- enough to tip the balance between sufficient supply and blackouts on several days.
Administration officials left open the possibility that Mr. Abraham would extend the temporary orders, which were put into place by the Clinton administration. But they said they were not prepared to announce a decision on the matter today.
State legislators in Sacramento wrestled with proposals that would overhaul the 1996 deregulation law that led to the problem. One proposal would make it possible for the state to secure long-term power supplies at lower prices than those that prevail in the wholesale power market today.
Legislators also debated ways of easing the debt burden of the state's two main utilities, which say they face imminent bankruptcy because they cannot recover the high cost of buying power by selling to consumers at fixed prices.
President Bush has rejected the possibility of using federal emergency powers to cap prices or mobilize energy supplies to alleviate California's shortage, arguing that such measures would ultimately do more harm than good. Instead, he has emphasized long-term efforts to increase energy supplies, like promoting more oil and natural gas drilling in areas that are now under environmental protection.
"The real solution long term is to enact President Bush's comprehensive energy policy," the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today. "He plans on making it a priority and we'll work with Congress to get it enacted."
Mr. Fleischer said that several cabinet officers, including Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Mr. Abraham, met to discuss the California situation this afternoon. He said they explored "options and ideas" for helping the state, but added that the administration preferred to see California work its own way out of the morass.
"The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter, dealing with the legislation that is before the state," Mr. Fleischer said.
In a sign that the new administration will continue to push for energy deregulation despite the California disaster, Mr. Bush today promoted Curt Hebert, a strong deregulation advocate, to lead the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees the interstate sale of power.
Mr. Hebert is a Mississippi native and an ally of Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader. He has said that he favors liberalizing the buying and selling of power in ways seen as beneficial to the nation's largest energy producers, who are eager to break the monopolies utility companies traditionally enjoyed to sell power in heavily regulated states.
Mr. Hebert, the only Republican on the commission, opposed a request by Gov. Gray Davis of California to use the commission's power to place a limit on the wholesale price of power last month. He replaces a Democrat, William Massey, who favored price caps.
"These are challenging times for the commission as the bulk-power markets more fully embrace the tenets of the free enterprise system," Mr. Hebert, 38, said in a statement. "I believe this system is part of the solution rather than part of the problem for the malfunctioning markets on the West Coast."
On the legislative front, California's representatives in Congress tried to force the federal government to play a more active role.
Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, introduced legislation that would impose a price cap on electricity throughout the West. Representative Bob Filner, also a Democrat, pushed a similar measure.
The state's other senator, Dianne Feinstein, another Democrat, offered a slightly more complicated bill that would give the energy secretary the power to choose between blanket regional price limits or to negotiate with individual producers to set rates of return for their sales to California.
None of the measures were expected to gain momentum in the Republican-controlled Congress or to win the support of the administration.
Work continued in Sacramento to find a solution. One proposal announced today was a plan that would relieve the state's two main utilities of their debt, estimated at $11.5 billion, in exchange for state ownership of their hydroelectric generating operations. The measure would help end the credit problem for utilities, which has made power producers wary of selling to them.

HEADLINE: Job Aides Open Doors For Those Who Can't 

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
Richard Bergeron, president of a computer consulting company, has Lou Gehrig's disease. He uses a number of devices that help him do his job, like a motion detector on his computer that lets him type by raising his eyebrows. But for all the special gear, he would be unable to work were it not for his assistant, Wendy Brown. She is often his arms and legs, and sometimes his voice.
 Ms. Brown accompanies Mr. Bergeron, who is completely paralyzed and barely able to speak, to business meetings where she might translate his muffled words to peers or give presentations on his behalf. She also takes care of his mail, telephone calls, faxes and follow-ups with clients. She even helps feed and dress him. 
 "Because of her dedication and compassion, I've been able to not only stay out of a nursing home, but also actually enjoy a very high quality of life," Mr. Bergeron said in an e-mail message from his Malvern, Pa., office.
Mr. Bergeron is one of a growing number of severely disabled people who are turning to personal assistants to help them keep up with the daily grind or even carve out successful careers, advocates for disabled people say. Despite the employment opportunities that have opened up as a result of technological advances and the legal protections contained in the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act, such human intervention is crucial to bringing more disabled people into the work force, they say.
Only 32 percent of disabled people 18 to 64 have a full or part-time job, compared with 81 percent of the rest of workers, according to a recent Harris poll. And more than two-thirds of the disabled unemployed would prefer to be working, the survey found.
"There are a lot of people we hear from who want to work but can't without that kind of human assistance -- either ongoing or just temporarily until they can learn how to do it themselves," said Ellen Daly, a spokeswoman with the Office of Disability Employment Policy, a federal agency.
Employers in industries where there are labor shortages are looking for ways to tap into the huge pool of unemployed disabled people, according to Chris Bell, a partner for the employment law firm of Jackson Lewis in Minneapolis. For most employers, the decision hinges on cost: Will the expense of employing an assistant, who can cost from $7 to $20 an hour, outweigh the benefits?
The answer is increasingly yes. Mr. Bell, who is blind, says his firm is happy to supply him a full-time secretary to help with tasks like reading client faxes out loud. Most other partners have to share secretaries.
For disabled people with sought-after skills, a small investment can go a long way. Take Richard Salem, a corporate lawyer in Tampa, Fla., who has been blind since 17. One of his biggest challenges is picking up nonverbal cues during meetings that could make or break a case. So his main assistant, Jeanne Crepeau, often attends client meetings with him and tips him off about body language. "I can whisper in his ear if someone is squirming in their seat or appears to have something to say," she said.
Mr. Salem said, "I rely on my assistants to do my job."
Employers are not required to provide assistants to perform such personal tasks as helping disabled employees take their coats off, getting them a sandwich or helping them go to the bathroom. But sometimes they do anyway.
Heidi Van Arnem, president of i.Can.com, a Web site for disabled people, has been paralyzed from the neck down since she was shot at the age of 16. She hired Pam Morenzetti as her personal assistant and later promoted her to handle customer service. She still relies on her, though, to switch her legs around to help with circulation and to give her a sip of water every hour or two.
"We have a great deal of trust for each other," Ms. Arnem said.
Such care can be expensive, but state agencies and nonprofit groups can pick up some or all of the tab. Quest, a nonprofit in Orlando, Fla., pays the salaries of three developmentally disabled workers who dismantle old wire and other metal materials for the Orlando Utilities Commission, and of their supervisor, Pablo Santiago. It makes good business sense, said Mark Ausley, site manager for the materials handling center. "They probably recover $150,000 in good materials each year," he said.
Vocational agencies in all 50 states provide money for so-called job coaches, who work with newly hired disabled people for anywhere from a week to several months to train them in their new jobs. Wendy Strobel, a job coach with the Virginia Commonwealth University's Rehabilitation Research and Training Center in Richmond, worked with one quadriplegic woman, whom the center had placed at a small- business development center doing telephone customer service.
"She had good communications skills but initially had a difficult time with the etiquette required," Ms. Strobel said. "For example, if someone called in and asked for the date of an event, she'd get nervous and freeze up on the phone. We set up a system where she could put the call on hold and I would then come on." After three months, the woman gained the confidence to do the job herself, Ms. Strobel said.
The Americans With Disabilities Act requires companies to provide interpreters for the deaf and readers for the blind. Beyond that, employers have to assess whether providing personal help is needed to ensure that disabled workers can perform the essential job functions.
The McClean, Va., office of Booz Allen & Hamilton, the management consulting firm, pays an interpreter $35 to $55 an hour depending on skill level, for four hours every Monday so a deaf employee can participate fully in weekly staff meetings, said Meg O'Connell, an associate in the firm's disability consulting division.
While the worker is able to read lips well one on one, interaction with groups can be challenging. "The meetings are important for the development of a team mentality here," Ms. O'Connell said. "We don't want any worker to feel like an outsider."

HEADLINE: THE POP LIFE; 
Man of Grand Ideas Welcomes the World To His Party in Rio

BYLINE:  By NEIL STRAUSS

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Last week, during a day off from the third installment of the Rock in Rio festival he created, Roberto Medina sat in his luxurious house in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood here. A Salvador Dali sketch hung on the wall across from him, a gift from Freddy Mercury of Queen, who, after headlining the first Rock in Rio festival in 1985, was impressed enough to ask Dali to create something for Mr. Medina, a Brazilian impresario. 
 To his left was a sunken living room with an overhead skylight that could be opened by remote control. A maintenance man tended to a pool outside, a maid prepared drinks in the kitchen, and a sound system quietly piped the music of Alanis Morissette throughout the house. Like his home, Mr. Medina, gray-haired, neatly attired and meticulously groomed, projected an image of tranquillity and satisfaction. 
 The scene was the antithesis of his festival, seven days of diverse music stretching past 3 a.m. on 2.7 million square feet of trash-strewn earth packed with 150,000 to 250,000 music fans a night. 
An advertising man by trade, Mr. Medina naturally lapses into sales pitches full of big numbers and grand ideas. The way he looks at it, Rock in Rio III, which ended on Sunday, pumped $180 million to $300 million into the local economy, generated $40 million in media coverage (local papers like O Globo dedicated as many as 13 pages of articles to the festival a day), donated 5 percent of its multimillion-dollar take to an education program, and is in the process of expanding the subscription base of its main sponsor, America Online (which paid some $17 million for the privilege), to 250,000 in Brazil from 70,000.
"Companies need to take responsibility for society and stop thinking that the governments alone can solve the social deficit, because the governments aren't," he said. "This is the task for the citizen and for private enterprise, and that's what this festival is trying to do. Corporations could sell more Coke at a higher price if they adhere to the philosophy that there's no better publicity than for them to engage in something that's serious and furthers progress."
Convinced that entertainment can be a more powerful tool of persuasion or change than advertising or politics, Mr. Medina plans to expand his franchise of socially conscious festivals into North America, the rest of Latin America and even Africa in the coming years.
The theme of Rock in Rio III was "a better world." Many who were hired to work at the event even had to write essays on their applications describing their vision of that better world. But for those in the audience, "a better world" was just another marketing slogan, swallowed in the sea of logos displayed all over the grounds on behalf of the festival's 15 sponsors. Unlike, say, the Beastie Boys's Tibetan Freedom Concerts, where speakers lecture the audience between acts, Rock in Rio III made little attempt to enlighten ticket buyers beyond sponsoring a small tent for speeches, discussions and presentations. 
"I said to Roberto Medina, 'Do you know the world outside your stain-glassed house?' " said Jose Junior, who leads Banda Afro Reggae, a collective of socially minded batucada, capoeira, funk and hip-hop performers who played at the festival. "Then I told him about the violence and poverty of the favelas," or slums. "The next day, his girlfriend came up and said, 'Who's Junior?' Then she told me that the night after Medina and I talked, he couldn't sleep."
Over all, this was simply an opportunity to see some of Brazil's most established acts share a stage (reputed to be the largest ever built for such a festival) with pop stars from around the world, many of whom had never performed in Brazil before. (The Who and Pearl Jam were the only bands Mr. Medina said he wanted to book but could not.)
The crowning moment of Rock in Rio III was the return of Axl Rose and the large-stage debut of his new-model, high-pressure Guns 'n' Roses, which adeptly tore through songs old and new in a show that was, more or less, seven years in the making. The other jaw-dropper was Neil Young's Brazilian debut, which followed a standard-issue Sheryl Crow performance and an oddly short set by the Dave Matthews Band. 
The audience watched in relative silence for the first few minutes of Mr. Young's performance. The crowd was unaccustomed to his huddled electric jams with his band, to the sight of a man whose power emanates from his back as he plays, and to the dictum that, no matter how long its recorded equivalent may be, a song isn't over onstage until Mr. Young says it's over. But by the end of "Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)," the audience began to cheer with every solo and clap along to songs that were never meant to be clapped along to. 
In a performance loaded with live favorites like "Rockin' in the Free World" and "Cinnamon Girl," "Like a Hurricane" stole the show when Mr. Young broke a guitar string and, instead of bravely finishing the song with a handicap like most performers, turned disaster to advantage. After a frenzy of inspired feedback and improvisation, he let the guitar hang parallel to his leg and, as he sang, slapped the fretboard with the end of the broken string, creating a moody, ambient version of the song.
For both popular and little-known musicians, a debut show in a new country can be crucial: a strong performance that leaves audience members rushing to record stores and raving to their friends can open a whole new continent for future tours, which is one reason two of the most enthusiastically received concerts at Rock in Rio III were by veterans of South American tours, Iron Maiden and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
At this festival, Queens of the Stone Age, a rock band almost unknown in Brazil, became stars overnight, but not just because of the show. When Nick Oliveri, the bassist, appeared onstage nude, a judge who was watching ordered the police to arrest him. A festival lawyer on the site was able to explain that Mr. Oliveri, having heard so much about Bacchanalian Brazilian carnival, thought nudity was acceptable in the country. He was released on the spot, only to see his photograph alongside that of Britney Spears on the front page of local papers the following day.
By contrast, Ms. Spears didn't seem to be winning new fans during her first Brazilian performance on the teen-pop night of the festival. 
It wasn't so much her overly slick presentation and long breaks for costume changes, or her over-rehearsed stage patter and camera-ready smiles. It wasn't even the clear evidence of lip-synching. (When she touched the microphone of her headset during a song, it didn't make a sound; but when she touched it as she was preparing to talk to the audience, it crackled loudly.) It was the overall coldness and detachment of a show in which Ms. Spears was unable or unwilling to create the illusion that is at the heart of almost every pop concert: that this is a special show for a special audience. 
Where rock acts like Guns 'n' Roses sought favor from the crowd by bringing out a samba school during their encore, Ms. Spears made little effort (which was probably better than Aaron Carter's committing the faux pas of thanking the Portuguese-speaking audience in Spanish at the end of his set). When films of American flags were shown onstage as Ms. Spears and her dancers cavorted in white outfits modeled on United States Navy uniforms, the audience hissed and then began chanting, "Brazil." (By contrast, when Mr. Young improvised on "The Star-Spangled Banner" in the coda to "Rockin' in the Free World," the crowd applauded.)
Asked what she thought of Ms. Spears's performance, Priscilla Alves de Franca, 17, put a finger to the tip of her nose and pushed her nose upward. "Stuck up," she said, as her friends nodded assent. 
It certainly didn't help much when, technicians working on the show said, Ms. Spears's headset microphone was accidentally left on during a costume change and her cuss-filled tantrum was heard by those watching the live broadcast. (The excerpt is already on Napster for those interested in hearing Ms. Spears's unscripted concert monologues.)
Though 'N Sync (whose late show kept fans awake until after 3 a.m.) delivered a much warmer, more relaxed, Brazilian flag-waving set, the pinnacle of the evening was Sandy and Junior, a squeaky-clean Brazilian teenage brother-and-sister team. Tears streamed from the eyes of 8- to 15-year-old fans as they passionately sung along with every word.
Often the pair would have to deliver only the first syllable of a couplet before the children in the crowd, who have grown up with Sandy and Junior, would fill in the rest. It was also interesting to watch the dynamic between the siblings, because, unless he grows up to become a heartthrob on the order of Ricky Martin, Junior, whose talents and charisma were far eclipsed by his sister's, seems like a VH-1 "Behind the Music" debacle in the making.
Many of the highlights of the festival's final weekend occurred on the smaller Brazilian and roots-music stages. As Ms. Spears and 'N Sync demonstrated America's latest pop export, the Brazilian band Funk N Lata was looking to performers from the more creative American past, namely James Brown, and combining the music with an 11-man bateria. 
Dancers in the wings pumped up their muscles with hundreds of push-ups before emerging on stage in a high-energy show best described as guarana funk. Also notable on the smaller stages, Tom Ze closed his strong set by using a welding torch as an instrument and light show; and the blind Malian couple Amadou and Mariam had the crowd singing along in French to their sweet, upbeat, Cuban-influenced brand of African blues .
Mr. Medina said he expected to stage Rock in Rio IV at the same site in 2003.

The Chancellor at Play
 Who was that man belly-flopping through the new snow on the 116th Street hill in Riverside Park on Sunday? None other than HAROLD O. LEVY, the city schools chancellor, turning the heads of passers-by. Mr. Levy was out romping with his two children. As they steered their plastic sled, Mr. Levy hitched a ride, gripping the back of the sled with one hand and his white baseball cap with the other as he hurtled down the hill on his stomach. 

Studying Governance
New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service is opening the Center for Excellence in New York City Governance. The school's dean, DR. JO IVEY BOUFFORD, a former president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, said the center's mandate was to "strengthen public policy and public service." ARTHUR FRIED, a longtime city official who was most recently general counsel of the Social Security Administration, was named executive director. The center will hold its first event, on the city's election machinery, on Jan. 30.

Columbia Courses Online
Columbia University is unveiling the first courses in its online continuing education program: information technology and American business writing courses for nonnative English speakers. The courses were developed in partnership with Cognitive Arts, an educational software company headed by ROGER SCHANK. Columbia and Cognitive Arts are working on adding liberal arts courses like psychology and economics. DAVID H. COHEN, vice president for arts and sciences at Columbia, said other courses would be developed more slowly than had been expected before the plunge in Internet stocks. The online courses can be reached at www.as.columbia.edu.

A New Charter School
CDCH Charter School, a new school for mainstream and learning-disabled children, opened this month with more than 20 children age 5 to 11 on the grounds of the East Hampton Indoor Tennis Club in Wainscott. Its founder, DAWN ZIMMERMAN, is raising $3 million for a permanent school at the Town Industrial Park in Wainscott, and plans to add a grade a year up to 12th grade.
The charter school arose from the Child Development Center of the Hamptons, a three-year-old preschool founded by Ms. Zimmerman that serves mainstream and disabled children. 

Support for Writing
Barnard College's writing fellows program, which trains talented undergraduates to coach their classmates in producing more polished prose, recently got a boost from two alumnae.
ANNA QUINDLEN, a former reporter, editor and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist at The New York Times who now writes novels and a Newsweek column, has donated $100,000. And CHERYL SHAFFER GREENE, a managing partner at Deutsch, an advertising agency, gave $50,000. "I owe Barnard a debt I can never repay, but I am bound and determined to try," Ms. Quindlen said.

EMC Results Beat Wall Street Expectations in Fourth Quarter

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The economy may be slowing, but businesses are not cutting back spending on data storage, according to the EMC Corporation, which reported fourth-quarter revenue and profit yesterday that slightly exceeded Wall Street's expectations. 
 EMC, based in Hopkinton, Mass., said revenue for the last quarter of 2000 jumped 40 percent, to $2.62 billion, from $1.88 billion a year earlier. 
 The quarter completed a year in which the rate of revenue growth accelerated as the year progressed, resulting in a 32 percent gain for the entire year to $8.87 billion. EMC told analysts that it remained confident of hitting its previously announced goal of $12 billion in revenue this year along with Wall Street's current earnings projections. 
Michael C. Ruettgers, the chairman of EMC, said the quarter had reinforced EMC's view that information was being created so rapidly in the networked economy and was so essential to competitiveness that demand for intelligent data storage systems was bound to remain strong. 
EMC reported that earnings jumped to $563 million in the last quarter of 2000, up 49 percent from $377 million in 1999, excluding a charge against 1999 earnings related to acquisitions. Earnings per share rose 47 percent, to 25 cents a share, from 17 cents a share a year earlier, excluding a charge of 8 cents a share in 1999 related to the acquisitions. 
International storage revenue grew 67 percent in the quarter, led by a 134 percent increase in the Asia/Pacific region. 
EMC also expanded its market-leading position during the quarter. The company's shares, which rose faster than any other stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the 1990's, rose $3.03 yesterday to $79.56. They are up about 20 percent this year, although still well below last September's peak of $104.94.
"EMC and storage are clearly islands in the storm," said Thomas Kraemer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Mr. Kraemer said storage companies, and particularly EMC, were adding so much software to their systems that they were becoming the intelligent hub of corporate computer systems. As a result, spending on storage systems is taking a larger piece of the information technology pie and hurting the prospects of companies that rely heavily on computer sales, he said.
In EMC's case, the increasing role of software in its sales mix helped lift gross margins to 59.2 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 55.1 percent a year ago. William J. Teuber, the chief financial officer, said EMC expected revenue from storage systems to grow in the mid-30's percent range this year. Revenue from services like helping customers put together storage networks is projected to grow at almost 50 percent and software revenue to grow at more than 50 percent.
But EMC suggested that profit margins might decline slightly because it planned to keep up its practice of cutting prices to expand markets and increase its market share.

HEADLINE: Penney Closing Raises Fear For White Plains Economy 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
J. C. Penney plans to close its department store at the Galleria mall here, raising fears among city officials about the business district's economic outlook just as the city is trying to encourage a downtown revival.
 J. C. Penney, which has 1,100 stores in the United States, said it would shut some 50 of its stores in the next six months after reporting operating losses in three of the last four quarters. 
 The White Plains closing, scheduled for April 28, would mean the loss of 235 jobs, said a Penney spokesman, Tim Lyons. A store in Ithaca, N.Y., is also scheduled to close. 
The management of the 20-year-old Galleria, at 100 Main Street, which functions as a more affordable alternative to the newer Westchester Mall here, said it was already reaching out to potential successors and expressed optimism at the prospect of leasing the 217,000-square-foot space Penney is leaving.
Winnette B. Peltz, the mall's general manager, pointed out that H&M, a Swedish apparel store, was set to open a 23,000-square-foot outpost at the mall in the spring.
But for officials in White Plains, Westchester's county seat, the Penney news represented a serious setback. Two blocks from the Galleria is a boarded-up former Macy's that has been empty for five years, sapping the energy from the heart of the downtown.
The city is still reeling from the recent withdrawal of a proposal by Tishman-Speyer, a real estate developer, to build a 21-screen Loews movie theater and shopping center at that site, a project that was to be the linchpin of its revitalization efforts.
"I was just so taken aback," said Mayor Joseph M. Delfino, who learned of the decision on Monday in a letter Penney sent to City Hall after it quietly notified sales clerks at the store on Friday.
"What's troublesome to me is that I never received a phone call from them as chief executive officer of the city of White Plains to advise me that they were going to consider closing the store," he said.
Today, Mayor Delfino called the company's headquarters in Plano, Tex., to try to persuade officials that positive things were happening in White Plains and that they should reconsider. But he was unable to reach any officials connected with the decision.
In the last three years, the office vacancy rate in White Plains has dropped to 14 percent from 34 percent, and the city recently approved 1,000 units of market-rate housing to be built within four blocks of the Galleria, he said. 
Mayor Delfino and others seemed particularly surprised because they were under the impression that the Penney store had strong sales. But Mr. Lyons said the stores chosen for closing were "unprofitable or were marginally profitable," though he declined to discuss the specific considerations here.
Today customers expressed dismay at the demise of a moderate-price store they frequented for clothes and housewares and worried what it might portend for the mall. 
"I'm very disappointed," said Clayton Byrne of Chappaqua, a lawyer here who visits Penney's to look for clothes for her grown sons. "Their prices are very good. I think it will hurt the mall terribly -- it's one of the anchor stores."
Some real estate brokers familiar with the county's retail landscape speculated that the Galleria might entice a chain like Target Stores, which was to be part of the Tishman-Speyer complex at the former Macy's site.

HEADLINE: With Private Help, A New Public School; 
Niagara Falls Turns to Honeywell

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
There is something phoenixlike about it, the glassy modernist building that lights up electric blue at night over this depressed city of incessantly gray snowy streets, vacant storefronts and abandoned chemical plants.
 Visible from almost anywhere in the city, it is the new Niagara Falls High School. Visitors come to see its Broadway-caliber theater, the sunlight shooting through the glass walls of the library like water over the falls, the students plugging their free laptop computers into hundreds of stations in classrooms, labs, even the cafeteria. 
 But mostly, they come to hear how it was done: in an unusual public-private partnership, Honeywell Inc. raised money on Wall Street and put up the $83 million school for the city to lease, allowing the city to avoid any increase in taxes or debt. And with exemptions from state laws, Honeywell was able to build the school for less than it would have cost the school district. 
For years, school construction has been one of the most contentious issues in the politics of education. Saying that the country's school buildings were "nothing less than a national embarrassment," the Clinton administration pushed for federal aid to build new schools, only to be blocked by Republicans who were skeptical of the idea that gleaming classrooms are necessary to a good education or who said the federal government should leave building to local communities.
But locally, school districts have not been able to get support for building, either. Nationwide, just 25 percent of the population has children of school age. Even in well-off suburban communities where pride in the schools runs high, empty nesters and those without children have repeatedly shot down bond issues to build new schools.
Niagara Falls offers a compromise, a conservative approach to a liberal issue. For school officials who have come to visit here, it offers a vision of the future.
Privatization has come to almost everything else in education, with school districts contracting out everything from custodial services to college guidance and even the operation of entire schools. Many school officials say it only makes sense that they should look to the private sector for their buildings as well. As Carmen A. Granto, the superintendent of schools here, says: "Our core business is teaching. We ought to stick to that core."
In New York City, a private group called the Schoolhouse Foundation has raised $200 million from private bond issues to build schools on a financial model resembling the one used here. Other cities in New York, including Buffalo, Ithaca and Corning, are also considering similar plans as they look to build new schools. 
David Erik Chase, the head of the Hillier Group, the country's third-largest architecture firm and the one that designed the Niagara Falls school, says he is talking to schools in Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., about such projects. "We feel we're on the forefront of a real crest of opportunity," he said.
The strategy is not without critics, or perils. Some fear that developers, eager for cheap land or good public relations, will offer to build schools but skimp on quality. With the school day already woven with commercial messages -- billboards on buses, soda machines in hallways -- others worry that all this will lead to Coca-Cola High Schools across the country. 
"There are significant questions that need to be asked," said Paul Abramson, president of Intelligence for Education, a consulting company in Westchester, and editorial director of School Planning and Managing magazine. "We need to measure in terms of quality and not just cost."
Private money becomes particularly tempting as demand rises and public support falls.
Most of the country's schools were built either for the last baby boom, in the 1950's and 1960's or earlier, and a third of those have not been renovated since 1980. Those baby boomers produced a baby boomlet that has sent public school enrollments to their highest level ever, with the increase expected to continue for the next five years. The General Accounting Office in 1999 estimated the cost of renovating the nation's schools at $112 billion; some people call that figure conservative, and it does not include upgrading classrooms for Internet access, which would cost about $100 billion more.
Five years ago, Niagara Falls had two aging high schools. In the older one, plastic bags collected rainwater in the hallways. The roof was lined with asbestos and leaked into the gym, giving Niagara Falls what the superintendent called the dubious distinction of having "the only high school in New York State to cancel basketball games because of rain."
A city that needs a new school normally goes to the voters for permission to issue a 30-year bond to pay for it. Cities can issue a 10-year bond without a vote, but Niagara Falls was too broke, as the superintendent bluntly said, to afford the interest payments.
The school board knew it would not get support from the community. Residents could not afford higher taxes; average per capita income is $10,500, and 63 percent of students, Mr. Granto said, are on public assistance. The industrial tax base the city once had has declined as chemical and other companies moved away.
When Don J. King, the president of the school board, first joined the board 23 years ago, there were 50,000 industry jobs, and Niagara Falls had the highest concentration of chemical plants in the nation. Now, he said, there are 6,000. "Realistically, the only way we could do this was to privatize it," Mr. King said.
Mr. Granto, whose coffee table reading in his small neat office includes a book titled "The $163 Lightbulb: How Albany Mandates Drive Up Your Local Taxes," approached the building division of Honeywell, which is based in Minneapolis. The company had provided boilers and other equipment to the district on a performance-based contract; the company promised the district that if it bought the new, more efficient boilers, it would be able to pay for them with the money it saved in energy costs.
Mr. Granto wondered why the district could not lease an entire school provided by Honeywell.
Honeywell agreed to build the new school and lease it back to the district. The company would not pay for the school, however. It issued certificates of participation, which are similar to government bonds, and sold them on the private market through J. P. Morgan, using connections no school district would have.
The district had to seek exemptions from the Legislature on several state laws: it was allowed to build the school without choosing the lowest bidder, it was allowed to issue the certificates, and perhaps most important, the district did not have to build according to the Wicks Law, which requires at least four contractors for any public works project. To win labor leaders' support for that exemption, Honeywell used only union labor.
The state reimburses districts for new school buildings depending on their relative wealth. In the case of Niagara Falls, the reimbursement rate was 83 percent of the cost. (The city raised the other 17 percent from sales of the two old school buildings.) The 83 percent goes directly to the certificate holders through lease payments for 30 years, so the certificate holders' investment, with a 6.5 percent interest rate on a tax-exempt bond, is secure. After 30 years, the building reverts to the city.
For Honeywell, the benefit was a chance to showcase its technology, and to earn a developer's fee of $5 million.
The private financing was crucial, officials say, but so were the exemptions from traditional building rules. "They were able to get a lot more into their building because of the Wicks Law exemption," said Charles A. Szuberla, coordinator of facilities for the State Education Department. The school district estimates that it saved $15 million by using one contractor.
The building hardly looks as if it was built with bargain material. The architect tried to infuse the school with the spirit of the nearby falls, with the blue of the outside stone suggesting the water and the staircases that jut out at inverted angles suggesting the flow of the rapids.
There are four wings -- math and science, the arts, health and sports, and business education -- surrounding a glass dome that houses the library and technology center. Classrooms have small side rooms to which teachers can take students for conferences or extra help. The ceilings in the art studios soar two stories, allowing students to create large projects.
There are computer ports in every classroom and along the bar that curves around the cafeteria. In the old schools, there was so little space for athletics that players would spread out to elementary schools and other sites to practice. In the new Niagara Falls High School, there are two gyms, including one with a running track. The bright primary colors of the school -- a different one for each of the four floors -- are modeled on the work of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian, with terrazzo floors instead of the usual vinyl providing the bursts of color. 
"Remember," Mr. King said several times during a tour, "this is Niagara Falls."
The school doubles as a community center now.
New laptops were leased for all 2,400 students, another benefit of the savings. Black computer bags have become a status symbol -- something even the suburban kids do not have. "You feel privileged. For once, we're the cool ones," said Jessica Sullivan, 15, a sophomore. "Kids like coming to school now. They have something to look forward to."
To those who say that sparkling schools will not make a difference in what students learn, Mr. Granto said he fully expected achievement to rise. The students agreed.
"It took all the excuses out of school," said Rachel Rafferty, 16, a junior. "Before, you could complain that everything's out of shape, it's broken. Now everything works. If you don't succeed, it's because you aren't doing something, it's not because of resources."

HEADLINE: Whitman Seeks to Boost Fiscal Legacy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Gov. Christie Whitman unveiled a $23.2 billion spending plan today that incorporates two major proposals of her soon-to-be successor, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco: a doubling of the property tax rebate checks for New Jersey homeowners and a new prescription drug benefit for the middle-income elderly.
 In her last budget address to the Legislature, Mrs. Whitman, who is expected to leave office by the end of the month if she is confirmed as administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, offered a host of her own modest initiatives, among them a tax credit to promote inner-city redevelopment and a $1-an-hour raise for workers who care for the disabled. 
 With an eye to her legacy, Mrs. Whitman sought to shore up her reputation as a fiscal steward by playing down the state's soaring debt burden and setting aside a record $1 billion cash reserve. She also set aside $25 million for measures to help end racial profiling by state and local police officers, another sore point for her administration. 
But the measures most likely to be enacted by the Legislature are Mr. DiFrancesco's, not Mrs. Whitman's -- a fact she acknowledged by including two of his top priorities: a doubling of the New Jersey Saver property-tax rebate, to an average of $480 per homeowner, and his Senior Gold proposal to cover the costs of prescription drugs for middle-class elderly and disabled people. The state already covers prescription drug costs for the poor.
Mr. DiFrancesco welcomed those items and called Mrs. Whitman's spending plan "a good framework to begin the budget process." But he said he was disappointed by the omission of a third item on his agenda as a leading Republican candidate in this year's election for a full term as governor: an increase in the maximum Homestead Rebate check for elderly and disabled residents, to $750 from $500.
As acting governor once Mrs. Whitman resigns, Mr. DiFrancesco will be free to discard her proposals and add his own. And he has already outlined more than $200 million that he wants to spend for other items including water quality improvements and aid to hospitals. Today, Mr. DiFrancesco said he could not yet name a proposal of Mrs. Whitman's that he would delete -- he was careful to say he had learned of many of them today for the first time -- though he reiterated that he was not wedded to her call for setting aside $1 billion as a reserve in the new budget.
In an interview, Mr. DiFrancesco said that once he was sworn in as acting governor, he planned to deliver a major address to the Legislature, perhaps on Feb. 5, outlining his own legislative and budgetary priorities.
The economic forecast that underlies state revenue projections is unlikely to change between now and then, however. And Treasury officials warned today about slowing growth in the New Jersey economy.
A strong sell-off in the stock market last year caused a 66 percent increase in capital gains by New Jersey investors, an "all-time high," said Treasurer Roland Machold. As a result, he said, overall state income tax revenues are expected to increase by $1.1 billion in the current fiscal year, ending June 30. But income taxes are expected to rise by only $606 million in the following fiscal year, Mr. Machold said.
Still, Mr. Machold said fears of a recession were unfounded. And in any case, he said, the state will be well prepared: the new budget assumes that a $1.3 billion surplus will remain at the end of the current fiscal year, and that revenues will rise by another $1.4 billion in the next. And it calls for a $1 billion cash reserve as a safety net.
In her speech to lawmakers today, Governor Whitman took pains to defend herself against what is likely to be the most lasting criticism of her record as a fiscal manager: the soaring debt burden of the state government. Since she took office, the state debt has more than doubled, rising from $7.2 billion in 1994 to $17.4 billion this fiscal year. By June 2002, officials said today, the debt will reach $18.8 billion, and required annual debt payments will reach $1.7 billion.
"Yes, we have increased our debt," Mrs. Whitman said. But then she rattled off the reasons for new borrowings: "saving land, building schools, fixing bridges, dredging our ports and building prisons." She said that each major borrowing had been approved by bipartisan votes of the Legislature or in ballot referendums, and that the state's credit rating had been repeatedly upgraded.
"You've heard the critics, but those who know best say that we're in sound financial health," Mrs. Whitman said.
Addressing racial profiling, the governor called for $25 million to recruit more minority and female state troopers, upgrade computers used to track the performance of the state police and install video cameras in municipal police cars across the state.
"New Jersey is not the only state where racial profiling exists, but it will be the first state where it ends," she said.
Her other budget proposals included some that were previously announced, like $200 million for a variety of programs to promote New Jersey's high-tech industries. She proposed modest spending increases for farmland preservation, water quality and watershed management programs, and crime prevention programs in the cities.
But Mrs. Whitman, who is all but certain to be the nation's new top environmental official, also unveiled a new "smart-growth" initiative: $10 million in tax credits to promote development projects in cities rather than in the sprawling suburbs. Officials said that builders are frequently deterred from choosing inner-city sites because the costs for upgrading sewer or water pipes or other infrastructure elements mean lower profits. Tax credits up to $1 million apiece for such investments will help steer more projects to the cities, they said.
Mr. DiFrancesco called the tax credit "a neat idea," but did not commit to retaining it in the budget.
The governor also set aside $3 million to help Salem and Sussex Counties replace punch cards with modern voting machines before the November election.
Democrats were not charitable to the departing governor or her successor, however.
State Senator Richard J. Codey, the minority leader, said that the state debt was closing in on $20 billion because of what he called Mrs. Whitman's "excessive" borrowing. "That's a lot of legacy," he said.
He recalled that Democrats had spoken out against Mrs. Whitman's penchant for borrowing as early as 1995. "Little did we know it would take six more years and another $14 billion in borrowing before she'd get out of town," Mr. Codey said.
And Senator Wayne R. Bryant, Democrat of Camden, alluded to Mr. DiFrancesco's candidacy in warning against a "frenzy of election-year spending."
Indeed, the governor's speech ended on a note reminiscent of a campaign endorsement as Mrs. Whitman praised Mr. DiFrancesco. She also cited Jack Collins, the Assembly speaker.
"Should I earn Senate confirmation, I will not only leave a balanced budget that builds on our accomplishments but also leave the governorship in the able hands of a proven leader, Don DiFrancesco," Mrs. Whitman said. "Thank you, Don. Thank you, Jack. Thank you, citizens of New Jersey."

BYLINE:  By Andrew Ross Sorkin

 BODY:
 MarchFirst, the new-economy consulting company, said yesterday that it would cut an additional 550 jobs and close offices just two months after cutting 1,000 workers. The moves are meant to stem losses as part of a larger revamping. The company, which is based in Chicago, hopes to bolster its business and its sagging stock price. The job cuts will drop the company's employee total to 7,600; the office closings will be in Pittsburgh and Montreal.

CANADIAN RATES CUT

BYLINE:  Reuters

 BODY:
 The Bank of Canada cut its bellwether bank rate to 5.75 percent from 6 percent to prevent the economic slowdown in the United States from affecting Canada. "Recent information indicates that the outlook for the U.S. economy has weakened more abruptly than had been anticipated," the bank said. Canada's big five commercial banks responded to the move by cutting their own prime rates.

Fearful of a Recession? Stop Hugging Trees, Start Collecting Bills

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
As the economy slows, some economists are openly uttering the R word for the first time in years. Though a recession is far from a certainty, Americans might do well to check out what happened to their profession during and after the last one for clues about what might lie ahead. 
 In that recession of 1990-91, jobs that were closely tied to economic expansion were hard hit. For example, almost every corner of the construction industry, from hardhats to civil engineers who oversee their work to interior designers, registered double-digit declines. So, too, did occupations that were already being transformed by new technologies, like word processing. 
 The fastest expanding job sector was computer technology. That was not unexpected, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com. "Companies use recessions as an opportunity to raise productivity by bringing in technology," he said. "In the last recession, pink collar workers -- people in call centers and back offices who are most vulnerable to having their jobs automated -- fared poorly. The same thing could happen in any potential downturn," Mr. Zandi said.
 Others who did well were workers who specialize in controlling costs and collecting bad debts, as well as entertainers and athletes who helped take people's minds off their troubles. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 NEW YORK

MANHATTAN: MORE SMOKING CURBS -- Moving to strengthen rules against smoking, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone is to introduce legislation today to ban smoking in the bar areas of restaurants. The city's six-year-old smoking law allows smoking in bars that are six feet away from dining areas, while Mr. Vallone's proposal would confine it to separate designated rooms, or to limited outdoor seating. Thomas J. Lueck (NYT)

GREENVALE: JOCKEY'S WIFE KILLED -- The Nassau County police are investigating the hit-and-run death of Marjorie Cordero, the wife of the jockey Angel Cordero, left. Mrs. Cordero, 41, was hit by a speeding car as she crossed the southbound lanes of Glen Cove Road, near the Greenvale railroad station, about 9:45 p.m. Monday, said Detective Sergeant William Cocks. He said the front end of the black Ford that hit her would have been damaged.There were no witnesses. Al Baker (NYT)

ALBANY: NEW SCHOOL PLAN URGED -- The Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the group that won a landmark court decision ordering the state to revise its education financing system to provide more money to New York City schools, called yesterday for an expert panel of educators and economists to determine what a "sound, basic education" should cost across the state. Gov. George E. Pataki plans to appeal the decision, which scrapped the state's complex school aid formula, and the appeal could take more than a year. James C. McKinley Jr. (NYT)

RIVERHEAD: COUNTY OFFICIAL SENTENCED -- The former chief mechanic of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department, who pleaded guilty to corruption, was sentenced to a year in jail yesterday. The former mechanic, Robert Davis, 52, of Calverton, was sentenced after he admitted that he stole cash and surplus military equipment and submitted false vouchers for auto parts and services that were never performed. Mr. Davis also pleaded guilty to 18 counts of official misconduct. Tina Kelley (NYT)

BROOKLYN: TEACHER ACCUSED OF ABUSE -- A high school teacher was arrested yesterday on charges that he sexually abused a 15-year-old girl repeatedly over a period of time, the police said. The teacher, Randall Lieberman, 34, of 75th Street in Bensonhurst, was charged with third-degree sexual abuse, a misdemeanor involving sexual contact with an underage person, the police said. Mr. Lieberman teaches at Lafayette High School in Gravesend, though the abuse did not occur inside a school, said Officer Guy Braun, a police spokesman. Andy Newman (NYT)

LIBERTY: SUIT OVER POSSIBLE CARCINOGEN -- About 100 residents of Liberty, in Sullivan County, have filed a lawsuit against the village and two gas stations owned by Exxon Mobil that they say were responsible for contaminating the village's water supply with a possible carcinogen. The substance is methyl tertiary butyl ether, or M.T.B.E., a gasoline additive that is a possible cause of cancer. Maria Newman (NYT)

CONNECTICUT

WATERBURY: CITY EXTENDS DEADLINE -- Nine days before a deadline that would have allowed the state to take over Waterbury's troubled finances, the Board of Aldermen announced Monday night that it would extend the deadline by one month. The extension will give state legislators time to consider the city's request to pay off its $50 million deficit over 10 years rather than the 2 years required by state law. The city finance director, Richard Russo, presented a plan that includes borrowing $86 million this spring and raising $212 million through grants, tax increases and cost-cutting over the next three years. Tara Bahrampour (NYT)

HARTFORD: TRIBAL ACTION CRITICIZED -- Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has asked the Bush administration to overturn a decision, made on President Clinton's last day in office, granting the Nipmucs preliminary federal recognition as a tribe. Mr. Blumenthal said the Bureau of Indian Affairs's decision is "the latest event in a series of actions that calls into question the B.I.A.'s credibility and fairness." Paul Zielbauer (NYT)

NEW JERSEY

CAMDEN: DISGRACED MAYOR SENDS LETTER -- In a letter from prison meant for publication, former Mayor Milton Milan criticized Camden's Hispanics for not standing up for him during his recent trial. "I just want you to know that I do not hate the people who testified against me falsely," he wrote to a friend, Angel Cordero, a convicted drug dealer, from federal prison in Cumberland County. "I pray for them. I also pray for the people who kept silent when they should have spoken." The letter was printed yesterday in The Camden Courier-Post. Mr. Milan was convicted of bribery and money laundering. Iver Peterson (NYT)

EAST ORANGE: OFFICER WOUNDS MAN -- An off-duty police officer shot and wounded a man who the authorities said tried to rob him at a gas station Monday night. The man, Rahjn Kalin, also known as Jeffrey Morton, was in stable condition yesterday at University Hospital in Newark, shot in the stomach and left leg, a hospital spokesman said. The officer, William Rowe, had just bought gas at a station on Central Avenue when Mr. Kalin approached him with a 10-inch knife, the police said. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

HEADLINE: Shopping Perks Up, Defying Worries of aSlowing Economy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
After the slowest holiday shopping season in a decade, Americans seem to have cautiously reopened their wallets in the early weeks of 2001, spending more than either executives or analysts had predicted.
 General Motors said last week that its January sales were unexpectedly strong, and DaimlerChrysler has canceled plans to shut two plants temporarily this month, citing consumer demand. After falling rapidly in December, mortgage applications for home purchases have bounced back and are again near their record high, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. Spending in restaurants and for compact discs and videos has grown more this month than it did in December, based on Visa USA's tracking of credit card sales. 
 Almost all of the nation's major retailers -- including J. C. Penney, Kmart, Sears, Roebuck and Target -- have sold more goods in the last three weeks than they had planned. Over all, sales at major chain stores are likely to rise almost 4 percent this month compared with January 2000, according to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which publishes a weekly retail index. In December, sales at existing stories grew just 0.7 percent. 
Despite the signs of improvement, there is little doubt that spending has slowed since the middle of last year. January sales, of course, are now exceeding goals that were sharply lowered in the final months of 2000, as energy costs rose, most stocks fell and the economy soured.
But the raft of mildly encouraging consumer data suggests the economy has not entered a free fall. The numbers also add weight to the argument -- still being made by a majority of economists -- that the United States is more likely than not to avoid a recession this year. Corporate profits may decline and investment spending flatten out, but a tight labor market and falling interest rates should keep consumers flush enough to extend the decade-long expansion, these economists say.
"The economy has clearly softened," said J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, in a speech last week. "For all the current media and public focus on the economy's softening, though, it is not at all clear at this point that the economy as a whole is slowing really precipitously."
Analysts caution, however, that the January data covers a short period of time during the least busy shopping month of the year. The pickup could reflect the weather as much as anything else, as a series of storms in December kept people at home and caused them to delay some purchases, analysts said. 
Even if consumer spending -- responsible for about two-thirds of the economy -- continues to recover from its late 2000 malaise, risks of a recession remain. Corporate inventories have been building lately, suggesting that companies may need to slow their production and lay off workers in the coming months. Many companies are slowing their investments in equipment and computers, after years of heavy spending. And the world's oil cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, announced a cut in production last week in an effort to raise prices.
But most Americans remain optimistic about the economy, even if they are no longer as giddy as they were in 1999 and 2000. In mid-January, 67 percent of people surveyed by the Gallup Poll described economic conditions as excellent or good, down from 74 percent in August, but still higher than at any point between 1992 and 1998.
More people think the economy is getting worse than see it as improving, but 63 percent of Americans expect to be better off a year from now than they are today, according to the poll. 
"I think that we are on a decline," said Julie DeMent, a 23-year-old student and part-time waitress, who was walking through a shopping district near Rice University in Houston last weekend. But, she said, "I don't think we're actually headed for a recession." 
Ms. DeMent has recently tried to save money on energy costs by sharing a ride to the community college where she is studying electrical engineering and by using her air-conditioner and heater less often. She also said she had cut back on holiday spending but was optimistic because she would eventually have a degree in engineering.
Economists said the Federal Reserve's surprise cut in interest rates on Jan. 3, the stock market rally that followed, the still-low unemployment rate and even the end of the uncertainty over the presidential election could all be making people less worried than a few weeks ago. 
Since the start of the year, the Nasdaq composite index has gained 24 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average have both risen modestly. At the same time, the most recent employment report from the government showed hourly wages accelerating in the second half of 2000, as unemployment hovered around 4 percent.
"People are still employed; they're still making pretty good money," said Frank A. Ursomarso, the president of Union Park Automotive, which owns seven car dealerships in Wilmington, Del. And, Mr. Ursomarso said, lower interest rates had made his cars less expensive in recent weeks. He can charge less because his own interest payments on unsold cars have fallen slightly, and customers' finance payments are now smaller than they were.
During the first two weeks of 2001, Union Park sold 121 vehicles, up from 105 during the corresponding period of last year. In November and December, by contrast, fewer people were walking into Union Park's showrooms to look at Hondas, Fords and BMW's, and sales dropped 4 percent -- or by 21 vehicles -- compared with the previous year. 
The widespread discounts being offered by the Big Three carmakers are also keeping sales from falling further than they did at the end of last year, said Ben Hollingsworth, the chairman of Group 1 Automotive, which owns 55 dealerships in the South and in Massachusetts. Many buyers can choose among making no down payment, delaying monthly payments or getting a rebate of $1,000 to $3,000, he said
In fact, "sale" signs have popped up in stores of almost all kinds, as merchants have scrambled to unload goods that they had expected to sell during the holidays. The discounts are helping to convince shoppers to make purchases but are unlikely to bring much good news for retailers.
"They may not make any money, but they're going to report big sales levels," said C. Britt Beemer, the chairman of America's Research Group, a consulting and polling firm in Charleston, S.C. This January, for example, only about one out of every two consumers who buys a discounted item is also buying a product that is not on sale, Mr. Beemer said. Last year, the ratio was one in three.
At the Target Corporation, which also owns Mervyn's and Marshall Field's, sales in stores that have been open for at least a year are up 3 percent to 4 percent this month, according to Goldman, Sachs. Target had been expecting a gain of about 2 percent.
Still, Susan Kahn, a company spokeswoman, said, "I wouldn't call January some outstanding month."
If the increases in sales are mainly a reflection of the discounts, consumer spending could start to disappoint retailers as soon as Presidents' Day weekend, the next major shopping period, analysts said.
"It's certainly hard to believe that people abandoned their prior gloom and went charging out to the shops," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. 
Skeptics also point to the unusual nature of both December 1999 and December 2000 to explain some of the recent data. In 1999, some Americans stocked up on batteries and other items to help them survive any disruptions that they feared might come from Year 2000 computer problems. Others bought jewelry or new clothing to celebrate the turning of the calendar. 
Last month, storms hit the Midwest, the South and the Northeast, delaying some shopping trips. As a result, the 1999 data may have overstated consumers' enthusiasm, while this month's numbers exaggerate the comeback.
"It may have turned a little better," Michael P. Niemira, a vice president at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi who tracks retail sales, "but it remains to be seen if it's anything to write home about."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a pickup in consumer spending reversed last year's and this year's statistics on the effectiveness of discounts in drawing customers to full-price merchandise. About one of every two consumers who buys a discounted item this January is also buying a product that is not on sale; last year the ratio was one in three.

Microsoft Agrees to Settle Suit Over Java Language
Putting one legal hurdle behind it, Microsoft has agreed to pay $20 million to Sun Microsystems to settle a four-year-old lawsuit over Microsoft's use of the Java programming language, the companies said.
 Under the agreement, the companies ended the licensing contract at the center of the dispute, which gave Microsoft the right to incorporate Java, the most popular language for programs that run on the Web, into Windows. Microsoft will still be allowed to use Java in its products, with some restrictions. Page C4.

HEADLINE: U.S. Diplomats Are Safe After Yemeni Hijacking Fails 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
An armed man who said he wanted to show support for Saddam Hussein hijacked a Yemeni plane carrying the American ambassador and 90 other people today and diverted it to neighboring Djibouti, where the crew overpowered him.
 The man was apparently unaware that the Yemen Airways flight that he commandeered was carrying the United States ambassador to Yemen, Barbara Bodine, and four of her aides. 
 The hijacking started less than 10 minutes into the flight and before the seat belt light was switched off. The hijacker moved from the economy to the first class section of the plane, where the American diplomats and two senior Yemeni officials sat. 
The man, wearing a dark gray jacket, placed a small handbag on an empty chair close to the cockpit. When a flight attendant tried to stop him, he pushed her aside.
"I am hijacking this plane," he shouted before storming into the cockpit. "Nobody touches this bag. It is full of explosives."
"I am a follower of Saddam Hussein and I want to fly to Baghdad," the hijacker added in Arabic.
The pilot, Amer Anis, began giving the co-pilot and flight engineer instructions in English when he realized that the hijacker did not understand what was being said.
The pilot told his crew in English that as soon as they landed at Djibouti airport, they should open the emergency doors and evacuate the passengers. When the plane landed, a Reuters correspondent who was on the flight from Yemen's capital, Sana, to the southern city of Taiz, heard the captain order the crew, "Start with the ambassador and her team, quickly, quickly."
Passengers moved to the rear of the Boeing 727 and jumped, one by one, out of the plane onto emergency chutes.
Mr. Anis said later that the hijacker, a Yemeni in his 40's, started screaming when he saw the empty plane, waving a miniature pistol that looked like a long pen.
"He started shouting and threatening me, 'You will be the first to die,' " Mr. Anis said.
One crew member fired foam from a fire extinguisher into the hijacker's face in an attempt to blind him. Another tried to wrestle him down.
"The hijacker fired one bullet, slightly injuring a flight engineer in his left arm," Mr. Anis added.
An airport official said two shots were fired, but all passengers and crew were safe, and the hijacker was arrested. 
Ms. Bodine and her team appeared calm throughout the ordeal. They declined to make any comment on the hijacking.

HEADLINE: Mayor to Propose Record Sum To Expand Cultural Centers 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
A 10-year city construction plan Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is to propose tomorrow would provide a record $1.2 billion for projects by city museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, as well as a chance for the mayor to extend his influence far beyond the end of his tenure.
 The mayor's proposal is to be detailed in his final budget package, which is due to be released tomorrow. His top aides, speaking yesterday on the condition of anonymity, said the budget also included about $1.5 billion worth of new tax cuts over the next four years. 
 The mayor's aides provided few details yesterday on where the money for the construction would come from or which taxes would be cut. 
Yesterday's disclosures were more of an opportunity for Mr. Giuliani's aides to show off their commitment to Lincoln Center, the Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art, the New York Public Library and other institutions, while also pumping up the city's economy.
"So many people come here specifically to see our museums, to see our centers for art, whatever form that it takes," one aide to Mr. Giuliani said. "This is in part to bolster that industry, because it is such a major component" of the city.
The city has previously committed to much of the proposed spending for cultural institutions, like the $65 million for the Museum of Modern Art's expansion project and about $25 million apiece for renovations and expansion efforts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.
But several of the other initiatives are showing up in city budget documents for the first time. These include $240 million to rebuild and expand Lincoln Center; $68 million for a new Guggenheim museum in Lower Manhattan; $19.2 million to expand the New York Public Library's Mid-Manhattan branch; $10 million to help the Brooklyn Academy of Music create a cultural district in Fort Greene; and $13 million to renovate the New York Aquarium at Coney Island.
The last 10-year capital plan, issued two years ago, allocated $487 million for cultural groups and libraries, city officials said, meaning this new plan represents more than a doubling of that commitment. The city's cultural organizations were pleased but not surprised by the plans, each of which the mayor has previously discussed.
"Thank God for the city's generosity," said Beverly Sills, chairwoman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. "Thank God for Mayor Giuliani."
Mr. Giuliani's aides would not say yesterday if he intends, as he has done in past years, to propose cuts in contributions to the annual operating budgets of city libraries and museums. "Stay tuned for the budget," one aide said. But a City Council official said yesterday that the Council expected the mayor to again propose such cuts. Each year, the Council has either restored the money or persuaded the mayor to do so. 
Mr. Giuliani's aides yesterday also provided no specifics on how the mayor proposes to cut $1.5 billion worth of city taxes over the next four years, saying only that these reductions would be in addition to the $2.5 billion worth of tax cuts already adopted by the city or state since the Giuliani administration began.
The City Council today intends to make its own tax-cut offering, voting to modify the current 2001 fiscal year budget by reducing a tax on rent that many businesses pay, officials said. Under that proposal, businesses that pay less than $150,000 a year in base rent would no longer have to pay the commercial rent tax, and those paying between $150,000 and $190,000 would pay a smaller levy.
Collectively, this would save city businesses about $16 million a year, although because it would go into effect halfway through the current fiscal year, it would cost the city an estimated $8 million. Over all, the commercial rent tax brings in about $340 million a year, so many businesses that have large or expensive offices will still pay the tax.
And Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles let it be known yesterday that Mr. Giuliani intends to press the City Council to allocate $12 million for grants that would help low-income parents send their children to private or parochial schools. Previous attempts by the mayor to set up a similar program have not survived challenges by the City Council, whose members have said it would take away needed dollars from public schools. The measure is no more likely to pass this year, they said yesterday.

HEADLINE: BUSH ADDS 2 WEEKS TO ORDERS ENSURING CALIFORNIA POWER 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush agreed today to extend for two weeks federal orders that require power producers to sell surplus electricity and natural gas to California. But his administration warned the state that it would have to resolve the crisis on its own after that.
 The extension ensures that neighboring states, which fought any renewal of the federal order out of concern for their own electricity needs, will continue to use extra generating capacity to supplement California's now chronically depleted supply. The action, in response to pleas from California politicians and power officials, also marked a softening of Mr. Bush's approach to the energy crisis after he repeatedly ruled out intervention. 
 But under the ruling, California would have to line up sufficient electricity supply on voluntary, commercial terms after Feb. 7, when the Bush administration said the federal assistance would end. 
The Clinton administration, which first exercised emergency powers in December to compel sales of electricity and gas to California's heavily indebted utilities, renewed the ruling six times and put no limit on extensions.
"This is designed to give the governor, the Legislature and the power producers time to take action," Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said this afternoon in announcing the extension. "I strongly urge them to take that action immediately."
The decision provided a brief respite for California. State officials estimate that the federal mandate helps the state procure hundreds of megawatts of electricity from neighbors, enough to light hundreds of thousands of homes each day and, at times, to tip the balance between normal service and forced blackouts.
Removal of that cushion in two weeks will add to the already intense pressure on state officials to work out both short- and long-term solutions to the power shortage. Without the federal orders, the neighboring states are likely to provide less power.
Bush administration officials said they extended federal help reluctantly. They said it was intended to give Gov. Gray Davis more time to arrange long-term purchase contracts with out-of-state energy producers.
That could potentially end the supply crunch in California, but would require the state to take the politically poisonous step of raising the cap on electricity costs and making consumers pay tens of billions of dollars more in coming years for pricier power.
"There's no question they will have to face facts and deal with this themselves," a senior Bush administration official said in describing the decision. "But there's also an awareness that they need a little more time."
Governor Davis and California's Congressional delegation put heavy pressure on the Bush administration to extend the orders in recent days. Though their pitch had less political weight than it did during the Clinton administration -- the governor, two senators, and the majority of both chambers of the State Legislature are Democratic -- people involved in the lobbying effort said they sought to persuade Bush administration officials that the power crisis could cripple the giant California economy and send ripples around the nation.
Mr. Bush, who administration officials said today made the decision on the extension himself, also came under pressure from representatives of surrounding states not to extend the orders. Many of California's neighbors have said that they are depleting water tables during the abnormally dry winter, thus jeopardizing their own hydroelectric supplies to keep California out of the dark.
"The president assured me that we will not be harmed by this any more after two weeks," said Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, who had urged Mr. Bush not to extend the order and spoke to the president about the decision today.
"But the president is walking a tightrope here between the terrible problem in California and the other states that are getting dragged into it," Mr. Smith said.
Some California politicians are skeptical that the supply shortage can be alleviated within two weeks.
The state's two main utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, say they have accumulated nearly $12 billion in debt because of the state's partial liberalization of the electricity market in 1996. The law requires them to supply the state's consumers at fixed prices but to buy electricity wholesale at market prices, which have soared to many times the retail price as supplies shriveled with the state's rapid economic growth in recent years.
But local politicians have fought to prevent higher costs from being passed on to consumers. They argue that numerous out-of-state energy producers and marketing companies have taken advantage of the state's shortages by increasing prices. State officials say they are reluctant to sign long-term purchase contracts at relatively high prices that ensure windfall profits for producers.
Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who has pushed for more federal help, said the two-week extension of the orders was welcome, but he expressed doubt that the matter could be resolved so quickly.
"People are still very divided about the solution, and I don't think it's going to happen in two weeks," Mr. Matsui said. "I would have hoped that the White House would keep its options open."
California was under threat of more power shutoffs today, the eighth straight day of the highest level of electricity alert. But state officials said they believed they had rounded up enough electricity to squeak through the day without new blackouts, in part by buying hydroelectric power from Canada.
They may not be so lucky in coming days. The state for much of the year has saved power by denying service, on occasion, to utility customers who volunteered for favorable rates in exchange for having their power shut in emergencies. But the utilities are fast approaching the limit at which they can deny service to those customers. They could then be forced to hit more ordinary retail customers with rolling blackouts.
As part of a possible longer-term solution, the state's Department of Water Resources today began accepting much-anticipated bids from power generators for multiyear contracts.
The generators have until midday Wednesday to submit their bids, although analysts are not optimistic that generators will meet the maximum price of $55 a megawatt-hour that Governor Davis has demanded. Instead, they say the bids are likely to be higher, in the $75-to-$80 range.
The federal gas order primarily helps Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of the PG&E Corporation. The company says its supplies of natural gas are dangerously low and has said that without extension of the federal order, it may be forced to begin halting gas service to "noncore" industrial users. Some gas suppliers had stopped selling to Californiabecause of the utility's huge debt and the possibility that it would declare bankruptcy.
The electricity order does not directly affect major independent power producers and marketers like Duke, Dynergy and Enron. Those companies have continued to sell electricity to California during the crisis.
But it does require municipal and cooperative power plants in nearby states to use any extra capacity they have -- many do not routinely run dams or other electrical plants at peak capacity in the winter months -- and transfer power to California. The problem, those neighbors say, is that the order requires them to drain dam reservoirs, used to generate power in the spring and summer.
"Our snowpack is just 50 percent of what it normally is, and we are being told to drain our reservoirs and ship power off to another state," said Dirk Kempthorne, governor of Idaho. "That's not a smart energy policy as far as I'm concerned."
Mr. Kempthorne, a Republican, added that he understood Mr. Bush's predicament in the short term and supported the president's promises to enact a longer-term energy policy.
Despite the extension of the order today, the Bush administration has stressed that it does not plan to continue day-to-day oversight of California's problems. It said it would focus instead on pushing legislation through Congress to allow energy companies to drill for oil and natural gas on land and water that are currently under environmental protection.
The Bush administration has also sent strong signals that it intends to push ahead with free-market liberalization of electricity markets, arguing that California's troubles illustrate the hazards of halfway deregulation.

HEADLINE: THE NEW ADMINISTRATION: THE PLAN; 
Bush Pushes Ambitious Education Plan

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush proposed a significant increase today in the federal role in public education, detailing an ambitious plan that includes requirements that states test all students in the third through eighth grades and report on their progress to the public, states and the federal government.
 The proposal, making good on a campaign pledge to focus on education in his first legislative initiative, would also provide parents of children in failing public schools federal money to help pay tuition for private or religious schools. 
 Mr. Bush detailed his plans in a presentation in the East Room of the White House alongside his new education secretary, Roderick R. Paige, who until a few weeks ago was superintendent of the Houston schools. 
Mr. Bush's aides declined to put a price tag on his proposals today, saying they differed slightly from his campaign proposals, but they would clearly cost tens of billions of dollars. 
At the heart of the plan, Mr. Bush said, lies a single concept: more accountability for schools that receive federal money, but considerable flexibility in how those schools meet the stricter standards. 
Mr. Bush also signaled a recognition that he may need to compromise on the most contentious element of his plan: giving vouchers to parents that will allow them to remove their children from schools that "persistently fail to perform."
"Parents and children who have only bad options must eventually get good options if we're to succeed all across the country," Mr. Bush said. "There are differences of opinions about what those options should be," he said, adding that he would "take my opinion to the Hill and let folks debate it." Excerpts, Page A14. 
Critics of Mr. Bush's plan, including teachers' unions, say vouchers -- a word Mr. Bush carefully avoided today -- would siphon money away from public schools that need the cash the most. 
Vouchers are missing from an otherwise similar education proposal introduced today by Congressional Democrats, led by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. 
Moderate Republicans, in their own plan, have also stricken vouchers, an indication that Mr. Bush may be forced to negotiate if he wants to get the main elements of his program through a Congress so closely divided between the parties. 
Mr. Bush frequently talks about how proud he is of the improvement in the Texas education system in his tenure as governor, though many of the changes there were put into motion before he took office. Crucial elements of today's proposals were drawn from his experience in Texas.
But the Bush plan also demonstrated how much the Republican Party's position has changed to conform to Mr. Bush's initiative. In 1994, one of his party's rallying cries was the elimination of the Department of Education. Under Mr. Bush's plan, it would become significantly more powerful, overseeing the yearly assessments of how schools and states have progressed. 
"There are parts of this we can't abide," said Amy Wilkins, a policy analyst at the Education Trust, a nonpartisan group that focuses particularly on improving the education of disadvantaged students. "But you have to say that the core of his proposal -- accountability -- is much needed, and a big change." 
"It's a serious proposal," Ms. Wilkins said, "and there is a lot to work with."
Mr. Bush's plan includes the following main points:
*States would be allowed to "select and design assessments of their choosing" for all students in grades three through eight, using federal money to develop the tests. But the plan must be used consistently to allow year-to-year assessments of progress and to clearly show the progress of various groups of students. Each school must publicly report results "by race, gender, English language proficiency, disability and socioeconomic status."
*If a school has not made adequate progress for two years, the local school district "must implement corrective action" and allow students to choose another public school. If there is no progress after the next year, "disadvantaged students within the school" may use federal aid "to transfer to a higher performing public or private school" or receive outside tutoring.
*In addition to conforming to state standards for reading and math, the states would also be required to set "challenging content standards in history and science." States would have access to money from a Reading First program, and other funds could be used in preschool and Head Start programs.
*States or districts could negotiate a "charter option" with the Department of Education, which would free them from some federal requirements in return for their agreeing to specific goals for increasing student performance over five years. There would be economic sanctions for failing to meet those terms. 
In a separate proposal, the details of which have not yet been released, the Bush administration wants to expand education savings accounts so that parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year and use the money for any education-related expense in kindergarten through 12th grade. Currently the annual contribution per student is limited to $500, and the program is intended chiefly for college savings. The new proposals would effectively give wealthier parents a tax-free option for helping finance a private-school education.
Today's proposals came on the second working day of the new administration, one full of diversions for Mr. Bush. He spoke by telephone this morning with Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, whom he plans to visit next month. He also spoke with the British prime minister, Tony Blair, a close friend and political partner of former President Bill Clinton. 
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair agreed to arrange a meeting soon, though it was unclear where it would be. Tonight, Japanese officials said that Mr. Bush had a five-minute talk with Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and that they had agreed to set up a meeting soon.
The Senate today confirmed two more of Mr. Bush's cabinet nominees: Melquiades R. Martinez as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Anthony J. Principi as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mitchell Daniels was confirmed to direct the White House Office of Management and Budget, a powerful noncabinet post.
On Wednesday the Senate is likely to confirm Tommy G. Thompson, the governor of Wisconsin, as secretary of health and human services. But Mr. Thompson has asked that his swearing-in be delayed until he can give his last state-of-the-state address, in Madison on Jan. 31.
In a 28-page proposal that Mr. Bush's aides said was intended as a guide to legislative language -- but not a bill -- the president contended that federal education dollars were scattered to the winds, $120 billion a year "spread across 39 federal agencies." Curiously, his plan does not call for consolidating many of those programs, though some would be refined, refocused or redirected.
Mr. Bush defended his voucher program today, saying that "in order for an accountability system to work, there has to be consequences, and I believe one of the most important consequences will be, after a period of time, giving the schools time to adjust and districts time to try different things, if they're failing, that parents ought to be given different options. If children are trapped in schools that will not teach and will not change, there has to be a different consequence."
On Capitol Hill, Republicans said they were thrilled with Mr. Bush's education proposal, saying they hoped to draft and pass a bill in the next few months. Mr. Bush said he wanted final passage in time for the next school year.
Many Democrats also gave the proposal high marks, saying they were particularly pleased that it zeroed in on the poorest, most troubled schools and revised Mr. Bush's original campaign proposal to offer them additional help. He also promised money for school safety and drug prevention during and after school.
"It has received very positive remarks in a bipartisan way," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. "He promised education would be his No. 1 commitment."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the ranking Democrat on the Education Committee, said he was encouraged by Mr. Bush's ideas, though he was opposed to using taxpayer money for private school tuition. 
A few Republicans signaled that they would push for vouchers but were open to other suggestions, like permitting students to switch public schools. Mr. Bush has incorporated that idea as an option in his plan. 
Senator Larry E. Craig, a conservative Idaho Republican, said, "There is some flexibility there." And Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican who is on the education task force, added, "I don't think we're going to walk away if we don't get everything on that issue."
Mr. Bush's plan closely resembles the bill introduced today by Mr. Lieberman and Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, which has generated strong support from moderate Democrats and is looked upon favorably by some Republicans. Under the centrist Democrat plan, which serves to reauthorize spending for primary and secondary education, the government would send $35 billion more than is being sent now to local school districts over five years. 
It would also hold schools accountable by requiring that certain grade levels be assessed every year. Schools that do not improve could lose their administrative financing. But education experts note that under current law, failing schools can lose financing -- and none ever have.
"The states set the bar so low that the threat is an empty one," noted Ms. Wilkins of the Education Trust. "And the problem with the Bush plan is that it does not define what constitutes an improvement."
Mr. Lieberman's plan does not permit parents to use federal money for private school tuition. It also steers more money to poor schools than does Mr. Bush's proposal.

Power and Profits

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
"Let them eat cake!" cried the new president's friend, a key campaign supporter who was also a prominent advocate of bakery deregulation, not to mention the owner of a chain of cake shops.
 O.K., not exactly. Kenneth Lay, chairman of Enron, was a prime mover in George W. Bush's presidential campaign; he has also been an influential voice in favor of electricity deregulation, and Enron is profiting handsomely from the electricity it sells in California. But what he actually said was that California's power consumers "need to see the price signals that is, pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get new supplies." He also rejected the plea of California officials for a federally imposed cap on wholesale electricity prices, arguing that this would merely "start spreading the shortage around." And his friend the president has echoed his views. 
 Full disclosure: Before this newspaper's conflict-of-interest rules required me to resign, I served on an Enron advisory board that turns out to have been a hatchery for future Bush administration officials. (What was I doing there? Beats me.) I can't say that I got to know Mr. Lay well, but I presume that he is an honorable man. He was, I assume, sincere in those remarks -- which one can't say about everything one has heard from former members of that board -- and he also, one must admit, has a point. But in a deeper sense he is missing the point.
It's true that the California power system lacks adequate conservation incentives. The regulated prices paid by homes and businesses do not rise or fall with the wholesale price. So even in a situation of severe shortage, with wholesale electricity selling for many times its normal price, individuals have no incentive to cut back; that is why there are blackouts.
Why didn't California deregulate the whole shebang? For a very good reason: The distribution of power, its actual delivery to your house, is still a "natural monopoly" -- you can't have multiple power lines running down each street. It would have been bad economics and worse politics to give the utilities that distribute electricity free rein to exercise their monopoly power. Someone should have warned that the system needed nonetheless to give consumers an incentive to conserve during power shortages; but the enthusiasts for deregulation led state officials to believe that power would be so abundant that such technical details wouldn't matter. 
Clearly, it's a priority for California to revise that pricing system. But even so, there is a very good case for a wholesale price cap; far from "spreading the shortage," such a cap would probably increase short-term supplies, and provide some much-needed financial relief.
The most pressing problem, after all, is not the blackouts but the imminent bankruptcy of the utilities; their financial distress also indirectly contributes to the blackouts, because of the difficulty they have in paying suppliers. And the wild wholesale market also, arguably, leads to another source of reduced supply: power-generating companies have a clear incentive to produce less than they can, because doing so drives up the prices they get on what they do produce. A temporary price cap would both take off some of the financial pressure and reduce the incentives to "game the system."
And there's a deeper principle involved, too.
Nobody to the right of Ralph Nader denies that prices have to be allowed to serve a role as "signals" of shortage or abundance, that the profit motive is what makes our economy run. But even now the public rightfully draws a line, fuzzy but real, between profits and profiteering. Natural gas prices that rise in a cold winter are acceptable; $10 a gallon for bottled water after a hurricane is not. 
And one can sympathize with the many people in California who feel that what is happening to them falls on the wrong side of that line -- that the Houston-based companies that helped sell naive officials on the glories of a deregulated market are now saying: "Sorry, it hasn't worked out the way we promised, but tough luck -- you'll pay the cost for our mistake, and we'll profit. And don't even think about alternatives -- our friend the president won't let you try them." It's not entirely fair -- but it's not entirely unfair, either.
Houston, you have a problem.

HEADLINE: LESSONS; 
Flaws in Annual Testing

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein

 BODY:
THE big idea in President Bush's education plan, sent to Congress yesterday, is to hold schools with poor children accountable, using an annual test. Pupils at schools with two years of inadequate test-score gains can transfer to another public school. After a third year of little progress, they can use public money at private schools.
 It seems reasonable to have tests identify schools that don't improve. But the president may put too much faith in scores that are less accurate than he thinks. 
 Under President Bush's proposal, commonplace measurement error could cause states to identify as "failing" some schools that don't deserve the label.
This column previously described the pitfalls of using one test to evaluate a student. Because any day's score might differ from a student's average, or true, score if the test were taken many times, one test should not decide promotion. Judging a student by one test is like judging a baseball player by one day's batting average.
It may seem that these problems don't apply schoolwide because when some students have good days, others have bad ones. If these average out, accountability using a test should work.
But even a school average can wobble around its true value, so sanctions based on annual score changes run a risk of unfairness.
Thomas J. Kane, an economist at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, Calif., and Douglas O. Staiger, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, have studied the accuracy of North Carolina's tests. When schools there have above-average score gains, teachers get bonuses.
But Dr. Kane says even tiny sampling errors can keep scores from reflecting true performance. Consider how teachers think of their classes as "good" or "bad" in any year. A less-able teacher could produce greater score gains in a class with better pupils than a more-able teacher could produce with worse students -- even if the classes are demographically identical.
Dr. Kane says that in typical North Carolina elementary schools, nearly one-third of the variance in school reading gains is a result of this "luck of the draw," that is, whether this year's seemingly identical students are easier to teach than last year's.
This affects small schools more, Dr. Kane says, because a few extreme scores can more easily distort an average. Thus, small schools with big gains may seem more effective. But small schools also more often post tiny gains or even losses. A small school's results may have more to do with sampling error than school quality.
Also, even at large schools, a rainy day or other random events may change children's dispositions. This can affect a school's rank: nearly another third of the variance in score gains is linked to the fact that a school's average can vary from one day to another.
North Carolina solved one problem while creating another. Like the Bush plan, the state's program judges schools by annual gains, not absolute scores, to avoid rewarding schools that test well only because they have privileged students. But sampling and random events affect both earlier and later scores, compounding the inaccuracy.
David Rogosa, a professor of education statistics at Stanford University, is analyzing error rates in California, where teachers at schools with rising scores will soon receive bonuses as high as $25,000 each.
Professor Rogosa estimated that if awards were based on school averages alone, over one-fourth of schools with no gains would still qualify.
But California avoids this problem by insisting that schools succeed for low-income students and each minority group, as well as schoolwide. This reduces the chances of undeserved awards, because simultaneous false gains in each group are unlikely.
But the reverse is also true. Schools deserving rewards will be more likely to lose them because if any group fails as a result of random events or sampling error, the school will be disqualified. Diverse schools will fail more often; they have more subgroups where false declines can occur.
President Bush wants to hold schools accountable for gains schoolwide as well as for disadvantaged students. So if either the school or the disadvantaged group posts a false decline, the school could be wrongly labeled failing. But the president's requirement that sanctions follow two successive years of failure is a partial safeguard against measurement error.
The administration's proposal is intended to spur achievement. Schools showing adequate progress will be encouraged to continue their practices; failing schools should change their ways.
But if the wrong schools are sanctioned, what message do we send? Will unfairly sanctioned schools drop methods that work? Will ineffective schools get rewards and continue poor teaching?
Surely we can find better ways to measure schools than relying on an annual test.

PERSON: Tamera Stanton Luzzatto 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Heading a Very Prominent Senator's Office

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN a basement dungeon in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hillary Rodham Clinton's temporary headquarters, Tamera Stanton Luzzatto, her chief of staff, ignores the clutter of packing boxes, the jumble of desks, the incessantly ringing telephones and the general mayhem that comes with the transition to a new government. 
 This is all familiar to Ms. Luzzatto, 43, a Capitol Hill insider, who has the perfect resume to build a staff, manage an office and shepherd a legislative agenda for a freshman senator. But Mrs. Clinton is not an average freshman, joining the Senate with expectations -- and baggage -- unmatched since Edward M. Kennedy in 1962. 
 "At least it isn't the same old same old," Ms. Luzzatto said. "This is a true next challenge." 
Ms. Luzzatto came on board just days after Mrs. Clinton's election, to get the office up and running, on the recommendation of John D. Podesta, chief of staff for the senator's husband, the ex-president. The two women hit it off and the temporary job became permanent, providing Mrs. Clinton with a top aide who is intimate with her signature issues, children and health care, and her latest cause, economic development for upstate New York.
Ms. Luzzatto, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister, mastered those areas in nearly 15 years with Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia. Rising from legislative assistant to chief of staff from 1985 to 1999, Ms. Luzzatto was his primary adviser on the National Commission on Children, the Pepper Commission on Health Care and ongoing efforts to bring prosperity to the depressed hollows of the state. 
Ms. Luzzatto's route to Capitol Hill is similar to that of many Democratic baby boomers, who have crossed paths along the way and still constitute an ad hoc family, a la "The Big Chill." Fresh from Harvard University in 1979, she worked for Action, a defunct organization that was, in the Carter administration, the umbrella for the Peace Corps, Vista and a handful of related projects. 
"There was no better way to start working in government and public service," Ms. Luzzatto said. "It was a small agency, with not many layers and a clear mission." It was there that she met Mr. Podesta, as well as other party stalwarts like Betty Currie, President Clinton's secretary -- and also her future husband, Francis A. Luzzatto, a Jewish refugee from Mussolini's Italy, who died of heart disease in 1999 at the age of 64. 
Only at an agency like Action would a 22-year-old be given the opportunity Ms. Luzzatto had: to run a pilot energy conservation program, in Fitchburg, Mass., a struggling mill town, which was later replicated across the country, including Elmira, N.Y. It was her introduction to America (and to cheap motels) and grounding for the work she would later do for Senator Rockefeller and now for Senator Clinton, who intends to repay her upstate supporters by making her first bill an economic development package. 
FROM Action, Ms. Luzzatto gravitated toward privately financed energy and environmental projects, a post in the losing Mondale campaign in 1984, and finally the Senate, where she found a job with Mr. Rockefeller, who had spent his youth in the Peace Corps. But for a leave of absence to work on the Dukakis campaign in 1988, where she was reunited with many of her Action pals, that is where she remained until the summer of 2000. 
Ms. Luzzatto's husband had been dead for nearly a year and she decided "to get off whatever ride I was on and finish grieving." She traveled, "did all the crummy things you have to do after your husband dies," and "reconnected with New York," where she was raised. 
She knows both the suburbs and city, since her father served as assistant minister at the North Avenue Presbyterian Church in New Rochelle, N.Y., during her childhood and at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan during her adolescence. There, the family lived in a church-owned apartment and Ms. Luzzatto and her siblings were scholarship students at prep schools, she and her sister at Brearley and her brother at Collegiate. 
Working for the junior senator from her home state, Ms. Luzzatto said, is part of the appeal of the job, which came just as she was polishing her resume. Then there is the scale of the endeavor, since New York State has 18.2 million people compared with West Virginia's 1.8 million.
And there is the celebrity of her new boss. But Ms. Luzzatto says that what impresses her about Mrs. Clinton is that "she knows star power isn't currency in the bank of the Senate." She describes the former first lady as a "workhorse, not a show horse," with an "instinct for organization" and a talent, like Mr. Rockefeller's, for combining visionary ideas with the humdrum legislative work that makes them happen. 
To succeed, Mrs. Clinton must reach across party lines, and that, too, is something Ms. Luzzatto knows about, in the most personal way. Three years before her husband's death, he had open-heart surgery. One hundred and twenty of Ms. Luzzatto's Senate and staff colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, donated 56 pints of blood.
"I've experienced the good side of Washington," she said, "the heart and soul that are here, on both sides of the aisle."

HEADLINE: 2 Drug Companies Post Solid Quarterly Results 

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN

 BODY:
Merck and Johnson & Johnson posted robust fourth-quarter results yesterday, indicating that sales of prescription drugs remain strong even as the economy cools.
 Merck, the nation's second-largest drug company behind Pfizer, reported a 12 percent increase in profits on rising sales of drugs like Vioxx, a pain reliever; Zocor, a cholesterol treatment; and Singulair, an asthma controller. 
 Merck reported net income of $1.76 billion, or 75 cents a share, compared with $1.57 billion, or 66 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Although the results were in line with Wall Street expectations, shares of Merck slumped $2.75, or 3.3 percent, to $79.56. 
Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at ING Barings, said Merck's stock price fell because Wall Street had been hoping that the company would post better-than-expected results, as it did in the second and third quarters.
"We got spoiled," Mr. Traversa said. "Merck is human again. It is not supernatural."
Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit, excluding special charges, rose 16 percent, to $924 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $796 million, or 56 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Analysts had expected the company to earn 64 cents a share.
Including special charges, Johnson & Johnson's net income was $891 million, or 63 cents a share, compared with $754 million, or 53 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Shares of Johnson & Johnson fell $1.63, to $92.69.
Pfizer is expected to announce its results today. Analysts expect that most of the big drug companies will announce double-digit earnings gains for both the fourth quarter and the year.
Mr. Traversa said that he expected the large pharmaceutical companies to report average profit growth of 15 percent to 16 percent for 2000. That should continue into 2001 and 2002, he said. Unlike the sales of many other products, prescription drug sales do not generally slow with a downturn in the economy, Mr. Traversa said. "People still buy drugs," he said.
At Merck, executives have decided to pour more money into marketing its newer drugs like Vioxx and Singulair as older drugs lose their patent protection. When a patent expires, generic drug companies can make their own, less expensive version of a brand name drug, and sales of the brand name drug often fall quickly.
For instance, sales of the Merck drug, Vasotec, a blood pressure treatment that lost its patent protection last year, fell 44 percent, to $330 million, in the fourth quarter.
Merck said last month that it planned to hire 1,500 sales representatives, increasing its sales force in the United States to more than 6,500.
Over all, Merck's spending on marketing and administration increased 12 percent last year while the amount spent on research and finding new drugs increased 5 percent.
Johnson & Johnson, which sells prescription drugs, medical devices and consumer products, benefited most in the fourth quarter from higher sales of Procrit, an anemia drug. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about fourth-quarter results for Merck misstated the increases in its spending last year. Spending on marketing and administrative costs rose 19 percent; 12 percent was the quarterly increase over last year. Spending on research and development grew 13 percent; 5 percent was also the gain for the quarter.

Musical Rarity
The quintessential Romantic composer Robert Schumann has been dead since 1856, yet one of his symphonies has never been heard in New York. So goes the billing for the Riverside Symphony concert at 8 p.m. Saturday at Alice Tully Hall, where George Rothman will lead the orchestra in the Symphony in G minor, Schumann's first orchestral composition after a hand injury that compelled him to abandon his career as a piano soloist. The music will be a version fashioned by the music scholar Marc Andrae, who combined Schumann's first and second editions of the two-movement work.

Art as Politics
Napoleon, renowned for military conquest, heroism and political genius, understood the power of art. He employed artists to further his political agenda through images and symbolism, and he fostered French decorative arts to build national prestige and enhance the economy. Starting on Sunday and continuing through April 29, his achievements will be celebrated in "Napoleon and His Age" at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y. Assembled from public and private collections, the exhibition includes paintings by David, Baron Gerard, Girodet and Baron Gros as well as sculpture by Antonio Canova and furniture, porcelain, jewelry, objets d'art, uniforms, court dress, swords and guns.

Flowering Art
Although Edouard Manet (1832-1883) was known for the pioneering realism of his figure paintings, his predilection for depicting his immediate surroundings led him inevitably to the still life. Of this French master's 430 known oils, 80 were still lifes. Beginning on Sunday, the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore will house what is described as the first major survey devoted to Manet's still lifes. Given its world premiere at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris last fall and drawn from museums and private collections, "Manet: The Still Life Paintings," on view through April 22, features 55 works.

Past and Present
Part oratorio, part opera, part music-theater, "Udu" blends autobiography, history, fact and fiction in a depiction of present-day slavery in Africa. This work, produced and commissioned by 651 Arts and created by the poet Sekou Sundiata and the composer Craig Harris, will have its New York premiere at 8 p.m. tomorrow and will be repeated on Saturday at the BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: If Protesters Can't Take to the Streets, They Can Go to the Mountain 

BYLINE:  By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
EVERY year at about this time, world leaders gather at a Swiss resort for the World Economic Forum, an event that usually produces images of prime ministers giving speeches and, at times, protesters railing against them.
 As this year's forum opens today, those who tune into the event may come away with another image: that of laser-beamed messages -- of no more than 160 characters, each character about 15 yards high -- scrolling up the snow-covered mountainside overlooking the resort, Davos. 
 The messages are part of Hello Mr. President, an Internet art project that is designed to collect the electronic musings of anyone, anywhere in the world, and project them out of the window of a nearby apartment and onto Bolgen Mountain. 
People may send in their messages over the Internet, by visiting www.hellomrpresident.com. Or they can send them using the short-messaging system on their cell phones.
Johannes Gees, a Swiss artist, is leading the $50,000 project, which is being sponsored by SwissInfo.org, an online portal for multilingual news. 
"It's like demonstrating in remote mode," Mr. Gees said. 
This is his second foray into Internet art. His first was an ever-growing quilt of images stitched together from photographs and computer graphics that people have posted on www.communimage.com.
With the Davos project, Mr. Gees said he was hoping to have some fun with technology and art while trying to open a less antagonistic channel of communication between protesters and world leaders.
Protests are expected in the wake of the upheaval last year during the World Trade Organization's meeting in Seattle. Last week, the State Department issued a notice discouraging Americans from visiting Davos until the world meeting has concluded.
It is not, Mr. Gees said, that he imagines that the problems of the world will be solved with this unusual communication medium. 
"Definitely not," he said. "I'm not naive."
But he added that he can imagine the project's conjuring a dialogue something like this: A worker in Mexico might hear about the project and decide to send a message from a local Internet cafe. About 10 seconds later, the words could be beamed onto the mountain's base. A corporate executive or Mexican official might see that message from the balcony of a nearby hotel and send a response using a cell phone. 
For those who want to watch the laser show, a photograph of the mountainside will be updated continuously on the Web site until the forum ends on Jan. 29. 
Messages must be sent in English, French, German, Italian or Spanish, Mr. Gees said, and will be reproduced in the language sent. 
The team, he said, will try to post a wide range of political viewpoints but will exclude those that contain racist or profane language. 
The messages will be shown from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. in Switzerland (or midafternoon in the United States). 
Mr. Gees has also decided to accept messages only during those hours. That is the best way, he said, to ensure that the statements that come over the Internet are interesting and meaningful. 
"I want people to think about what they are going to say," he said, "and not just sit at their computer and send something and then forget about it."

HEADLINE: Is Cindy Crawford A Bad Neighbor? 

BYLINE:  By LINDA LEE 

 BODY:
THE model Cindy Crawford and the nightclub entrepreneur Rande Gerber spend most of their time in Los Angeles. But they keep a co-op apartment in Manhattan at 33 East 70th Street, where they now find themselves squaring off with their neighbors. Last week, when the couple arrived in New York to open Mr. Gerber's new nightspot, the Underbar on Union Square, they said they were surprised to find themselves defendants in a lawsuit filed Jan. 10 by Marina and John French, their downstairs neighbors. The suit asserted that the Frenches' lives had been disrupted since 1998 by "intolerable noises" from upstairs, in particular "the intimate sounds of daily life." 
 No, not those intimate sounds. (And the Frenches should be grateful that when Ms. Crawford gave birth at home 18 months ago, she chose her other home.) The lawsuit lists the offending sounds as telephones ringing, toilets flushing, doors opening and closing and footsteps overhead. "It's Rande's high heels," Ms. Crawford joked. 
 Mr. Gerber said, "Cindy said I'd better take down the disco ball."
They are, however, taking the matter seriously. "They're not wearing their shoes now," Mr. French said on Monday. But he can still hear them thumping around. "This morning someone dropped some coins on the floor and it sounded like hammers on the floor," he said.
Like teenagers who cannot bear the sound of their parents chewing, New Yorkers, stacked one on top of another, have noise issues that no amount of nirvana at Integral Yoga will overcome. They raise their eyes to heaven as the neighbors' 4-year-old dumps out a crate of Legos; they accept that on Superbowl Sunday, they will hear groans and cheers from apartments on all sides.
But New Yorkers do not want to hear any noise at all after 10 p.m., the magic time when the standard lease and co-op bylaws assure "peaceful enjoyment" of an apartment.
Lawyers, builders and owners believe that noise complaints are increasing, and they blame the economy. Money brings changes, including that new home theater next door, the one with the subwoofer. And people have been redecorating, pulling up the wall-to-wall, putting down marble, leaving floors bare. (Most leases and co-op rules require that 75 percent of floors be covered, to control noise.) 
When apartment dwellers replace plaster ceilings with wallboard, decibel levels rise fast. Chuck Walsh of Apartments Unlimited, which owns three rental buildings in the East Village and manages others, says that ceilings made with wooden laths and two layers of plaster deaden sound, while two layers of 5/8-inch-thick wallboard create "a drum overhead."
And then there's the climb in apartment prices, which has inspired a lot of quiet, older couples to cash in. Enter young families. By contrast they sound "like football practice going on above you," said Stuart Saft, head of the real estate department of the law firm Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman and Herz, which represents the co-op board at Ms. Crawford's building. 
Mr. French said that the previous upstairs tenants had not been a quiet old couple. On the contrary, he said, they "had an active family life," and children who visited frequently.
Indeed, Mr. French believes Ms. Crawford's contractor removed sound-deadening material between her floor and the concrete slab above his ceiling. Bernard Wincig, the lawyer for Ms. Crawford and Mr. Gerber, said, "We'll explore a mutually amicable solution -- if there's a problem we'll correct it."
"I spent a year trying to get through to Cindy," Mr. French said, sounding like a suitor. "I wrote her letters, I tried to make contact and talk to her as soon as it became apparent that there would be a problem." Mr. French, who is a lawyer and the former president of the co-op board, sued the board as well, seeking damages for nuisance, loss of value, court costs and an injunction to force "defendants Crawford and Gerber" to fix things up there.
Mr. Saft counters that the board believes Ms. Crawford and Mr. Gerber have done everything they can. "We requested as soon as the complaints came in to have the apartment inspected to be sure the floors were covered," he said. Mr. Wincig said that in the apartment, "the surface is covered 90 percent with carpeting or rugs." 
Mr. Saft noted that noise is in the mind of the listener. After one couple in another East Side building complained about being awakened every day at 6:30 by a thud coming from directly above their bedroom, it turned out to be nothing more than a 10-year-old jumping out of bed. "The little girl has a right to get out of bed," he said.
It may not always seem that way to a neighbor. Last September, in Los Angeles, a man allegedly lost control when his neighbor's alarm clock went off at 5:45 a.m. and started shooting a rifle through the wall. (No one was hit.)
Marc Luxemburg, president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that noise complaints often come down to this: "You're always going to have people who are somewhat more sensitive to noise living underneath people who are somewhat less sensitive to their neighbor's concerns," he said. "Everyone hears noises in their apartments -- so to what extent are you sensitive to them?"
For those who can't help being sensitive, noise complaints in New York are forwarded from 911 to a "quality of life" phone line. Landlord-Tenant Court stands ready to resolve disputes, but mediation may be a better recourse than any court. Mediation in New York is handled by the State Court Alternative Dispute Resolution organization. 
"Instead of having the parties argue positions and rights, and a judge decide a win-lose situation and who violated an ordinance, in mediation the idea is really to get them to their practical concerns," said Daniel M. Weitz, coordinator for the program. "It's usually about peace and quiet. We ask people to prioritize, and the parties come up with solutions." 
The best solutions (as always) come with communication. Mr. Walsh, of Apartments Unlimited, represented one elderly landlord who started receiving complaints from a tenant after he renovated her building. Mr. Walsh checked to make sure the couple next door had installed carpets and moved speakers away from the walls. 
Only then did the young woman confess that it was the sound of her neighbors making love all night that was driving her crazy.
The landlord "was so mortified, he had the contractor go over there and ripped down the walls and put up sound board," Mr. Walsh said. "It cost him a fortune." In landlord parlance, such tenants are called "the honeymooners."
Now, Mr. and Mrs. French, that's the real intimate sound of daily life.

HEADLINE: Nannies Get Tough, Parents Tremble 

BYLINE:  By KIMBERLY STEVENS 

 BODY:
THERE'S a power struggle under way in many households between parents and nannies, and the nannies seem to be gaining the upper hand.
 You've heard about parents who install videocams so they can spy on the baby sitter? Well, nannies are beginning to return the scrutiny. Just check out the chat rooms proliferating on the Internet, where nannies exchange juicy anecdotes about dysfunctional parents and their spoiled offspring. "What good am I to these kids when I'm angry and frustrated?" one nanny recently asked her peers. 
 Other nannies don't get mad -- they get even, posting the names of "bad" employers in hopes of scaring away other candidates. 
Not long ago, nannies landed in the spotlight only when women with high-level political appointments were caught hiring them off the books. The notion of nannies venting online -- never mind demanding compensation packages that include stock options, Broadway tickets and up to three weeks of paid vacation, plus travel expenses -- was inconceivable.
That changed when the economy expanded, encouraging more households to opt for private care over group care.
The number of nannies in the United States has gone up 25 percent in five years, to more than a million, according to estimates by the International Nanny Association, a 16-year-old group. But there's still a nanny gap.
The result is fierce competition among moms who want on-call care -- and are willing to pay top dollar -- and a demanding new work force. "The nanny has become a much more powerful figure in the household and in the neighborhood, especially a beloved, respected nanny," said Clifford Greenhouse, director of nanny placement at the Pavillion Agency in New York.
Lyn Peterson, who lives in Scarsdale, N.Y., offers her nanny everything from private Internet access to all-expenses-paid ski trips with the family to Vail. "You're so vulnerable, you just do whatever they want," Ms. Peterson said.
A Manhattan mother, asking not to be named, said, "All the mothers I know are intimidated by their nannies," adding that you don't want her to be unhappy and possibly take it out on your child.
"It's a very subtle thing," she said, comparing the managerial skills that are required of her as a magazine editor to those required for an employer at home. "You don't question where she's taking the child during the daytime because you don't want her to think you're infringing on her independence. You don't ask her to work overtime if she doesn't want to."
This woman wound up paying her nanny for two weeks of leave after only four months on the job. "We gave in," she said. "We didn't want to lose her."
In New York, parents say, the demand for good nannies is so pitched that nanny cartels can effectively shut out unknown nannies and families that fail to abide by the rules. This can mean handing over not only control of the children -- their social lives, wardrobes, eating habits and doctors' appointments -- but other managerial responsibilities.
"It used to be a nanny was just another working member of a household," said Carmine De La Gala, who has worked for upper income households in New York since 1993. But now, she said, nannies often help supervise housekeepers and repair people.
Today's nannies even delegate rudimentary household chores to others -- including parents. Carol Fitzgerald and her husband, Jeffrey, parents of 4-year-old twins on the Upper West Side, gave up asking the nanny to do more than pick up toys.
Helping nannies to build a united front are dozens of Web sites and support groups, including the National Association of Nannies (www .nannyassociation.com).
"We'd be provincial if we didn't think our nanny was online," Ms. Peterson said. "I assume my nanny is in the nanny chat rooms."
The Internet is not that different from a conventional playground, said Heather Heflin, who works for a family in Chappaqua, N.Y., and moderates www.unitednannies.com. "It's a place to find common ground and to blow off steam. Difficult employers are discussed on the board, especially with the regulars, because they really get to know each other."
Real-life playgrounds still provide a way to network, too.
"It's really like the nanny den," said Francie Hermelin, who takes her 13-month-old to a playground in TriBeCa. "It's really intimidating." She added, "If you get on their bad side, I don't know how you'd find another nanny in this town."
One mother in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, Danielle Claro, said the nannies in her neighborhood ganged up on a parent recently because she had fired a series of nannies. "That woman was simply written off," Ms. Claro said, and was forced to seek a new nanny in another part of town.
As Mr. Greenhouse, the placement director, said, "No matter how big you think New York is, when it comes to nannies and baby sitters, it becomes a very small place."
When one longtime nanny, Diane Sleeper, took a job on the Upper West Side recently she was struck by how entrenched the nanny network had become. "The nannies are often more exclusive than the mothers," she said, alluding to stares from the playground cliques. 
Ever since the days of the Irish nanny, young women have relied on one another for job leads and social support. Today, many nannies are from Latin America, the Caribbean islands and Asia, and their networks break down accordingly.
Settling in the more affordable boroughs outside Manhattan, they often commute long distances to work. Some make reverse commutes during the day, taking their charges to playgrounds in Queens or the Bronx so they can meet with other nannies they know. 
Susan Carlton, a co-author of "The Nanny Book: The Smart Parent's Guide to Hiring, Firing and Every Sticky Situation in Between" (St. Martin's Griffin, 1999), says play dates are often arranged because two nannies are friends.
Yet parents hesitate to question their nannies' day-to-day activities. "We don't want our nanny to think we have a bias against certain neighborhoods or the company a nanny may keep," Ms. Carlton said.
In New York, bias has elements of class consciousness. Teresa Coles, a British nanny who has worked for New York families for 18 years, said she appreciates the flexibility of her current employers in TriBeCa. "There are plenty of families down here that don't want their arty kid traveling uptown to socialize in what they perceive as a more sterile, conservative environment," she said. 
Other parents try to work around their nannies' needs. After Jean Koerner and her husband, Greg, hired a Tibetan nanny about a year ago, they were startled one day when they were asked to attend a birthday party for a child whose parents they had never met.
They decided to encourage other families in their Greenwich Village neighborhood to hire friends and relatives of the nanny. That way, Ms. Koerner said, "You don't have to worry about the nanny traveling across town for play dates."
Though nannies typically work long hours -- 12-hour days are not unusual -- many are making the time to attend meetings of groups like the International Nanny Association, which has 530 members in the United States. 
Nannies also get together socially. Thirty gathered recently at the Redeye Grill, in Midtown, to unwind and talk shop over drinks and dinner.
One thing many agree on: salaries and benefits have never been better. "Eighteen months ago, the average nanny's salary was between $9 and $12 a hour," said Stephanie Breedlove, who helps run an accounting firm based in Austin, Tex., that specializes in household payroll issues. "Now, it's between $11 and $15."
In a scramble to attract and keep nannies, Ms. Breedlove said, many parents over the last five years have started providing health insurance, paid sick leave and vacation, none of which is required by law. Some offer to pay tuition so that their nannies can improve their language and teaching skills.
In Silicon Valley, recruitment "carrots" have included stock options, said Denise Collins, the owner of Aunt Ann's, a placement agency in San Francisco. But, she said, "the dot-com bomb," coupled with many nannies preferring to be paid up front, may put an end to the stock option come-on.
Many families still shower their nannies with old-fashioned gifts. One New York couple, asking not to be named, said they felt compelled to give their nanny orchestra tickets to "The Lion King" after she mentioned that "everyone else in the neighborhood had gone to see the show."
The Fitzgeralds give their nanny round-trip airplane tickets home to England at least once a year, plus paid vacations and annual bonuses -- and even an occasional bottle of wine after a hard day of work.
Over the four years they have known each other, the two women have become close, Ms. Fitzgerald said. Nevertheless, she added: "I was intimidated. My husband kept having to remind me that she worked for us."

HEADLINE: Swank Plans In Skid Row Los Angeles 

BYLINE:  By FRANCES ANDERTON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
IN "The Million Dollar Hotel," a movie opening next week, the director Wim Wenders focuses on a flophouse, the Frontier Hotel, in downtown Los Angeles. The movie, in fact, was shot in the dilapidated hotel, whose rooftop sign trumpets its impressive cost in the 1920's: "The Million Dollar Hotel." There on screen are its still-tatty rooms ($14 a night), its heavy brick facade, the cracked sidewalks outside and, nearby, the other sad, fallen buildings in Los Angeles's impoverished, abandoned core.
 Another man, Tom Gilmore, 48, has a different view of Downtown. He is now in escrow to buy the hotel that stars in the movie. Mr. Gilmore is adding the Frontier to the six buildings, one garage and one parking lot he already owns on the same block as part of a plan to turn this defunct commercial district near Skid Row into a thriving residential area. "Everything we do starts out being something really seedy," he said. 
 Mr. Gilmore, a former New Yorker, is the loudest, most ebullient true believer in the unconventional wisdom that Los Angeles has a soul -- its beautiful but down-at-the-heels historic Downtown, which the middle class has forgotten for years except as a movie location. He is banking that Angelenos will trade beach, hills or suburban flatlands for a loft there. 
Mr. Gilmore and his partners at Gilmore Associates will spend, by his estimate, $170 million -- with help from equity partners, and city, state and federal agencies -- on Downtown, including former financial buildings in the historic core, near Pershing Square (redesigned in 1994 by Ricardo Legoretta) and only blocks from Arata Isozaki's Museum of Contemporary Art. Mr. Gilmore has grandly christened his buildings between Fourth and Fifth Streets "the Old Bank District." The name, he says, is a handy marketing ploy to counter the perception problem connected with Downtown, an area as undesirable as the Lower East Side of Manhattan was 10 years ago. 
Fourth and Main has itself served as a generic corner of "Manhattan" being showered by meteors in the opening scenes of the movie "Armageddon." In fact, the historic core of Downtown could stand in for Any City, U.S.A., circa 1932.
Many here believe that if anyone has a chance to turn Downtown around, it is Mr. Gilmore. One of his properties, the San Fernando Building, has been open for three months, and its 70 apartments are almost all rented, from $800 a month for a studio to $2,400 a month for a two-bedroom loft. The sprawling turn-of-the-century Hellman Building opens on Saturday with more than half of its apartments rented. Conversions on the Rowan, the Continental, the Frontier, the El Dorado and the Farmers and Merchants Bank buildings are in the works.
A convergence of factors have made Downtown ripe for habitation: a tight housing market; a new city ordinance allowing office buildings to be turned into apartments; a bumper crop of historic buildings available at rock bottom prices because of a recession in the early 1990's. Ed Rosenthal, a longtime real estate broker who has seen past Downtown projects fail miserably, said: "The entire environment is now geared to reclaiming these inner cities, which it wasn't before. Circumstances are such that Gilmore fits the lock."
Downtown Los Angeles has already sprouted a number of cultural institutions, often presented as the answer to reviving inner cities. The Staples Center, a sports arena, that opened in 1999, is several blocks southwest of Gilmore's development. The Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by Frank Gehry, is scheduled to open in 2003, in the Bunker Hill area. Also, Rafael Moneo's Our Lady of Angels Catholic Cathedral is being built near the concert hall. The Southern California Institute of Architecture has relocated from Marina del Rey to a railroad freight building in the artists' district in east Downtown. And new stops on the subway have opened Downtown. 
Andre Balazs is opening another hip Standard Hotel in Bunker Hill, and several art galleries have moved into Chinatown on the other side of the Hollywood Freeway. Downtown is heating up.
Stoking the fire is Mr. Gilmore. He is "the P. T. Barnum of developers," said a competing developer, Dan Rosenfeld, affectionately. The Los Angeles Times has heralded him as "a Downtown proselytizer, a sort of combination Robert Moses and Aimee Semple McPherson."
"Downtown is so much better for what he's done," said Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose district includes Mr. Gilmore's area. "He's come in with fresh eyes and looked at possibilities others had given up on."
A painter-turned-gardener-turned-architectural-designer and now developer, Mr. Gilmore was born in Manhattan and grew up on Long Island. He moved to Los Angeles in the early 90's; three years ago he bought the San Fernando Building. "I thought, 'This is a city I can have an impact on,' " he said.
But many people are doubtful Los Angeles needs a thriving Downtown. "I'm not convinced there needs to be one," said Matthew Miller, of Cresa Partners, a company that advises companies on leasing office space. "And the trend is for less centralization rather than more." That said, he added, "Downtown is not dead or dying." 
However, it is a place with a very irregular heartbeat. In the early 1900's, the business and entertainment center of Los Angeles was between Third and Seventh Streets on Broadway and Spring. But Downtown today is a strange and atmospheric four-square-mile area. In it is a hodgepodge of disparate neighborhoods, including Little Tokyo and Skid Row, "bumping together like icebergs," said Jack Kyser, a local economist. 
To the north are city, state and federal buildings. Broadway, which slices from north to south, is now a thriving Hispanic shopping street. To the east of the Old Bank District is the 12-square-block Skid Row area, where several thousand men and women fill missions and single-room-occupancy hotels. There are vibrant produce, jewelry, toy and garment districts. Downtown is alive by day but dead at night.
Mr. Gilmore is not the first to try to put new housing Downtown. Last year, a developer, Geoffrey Palmer, built an Italianate-themed block of corporate apartments near the financial district in Bunker Hill and surprised naysayers by filling it. (Other high-end apartments were built near the Museum of Contemporary Art in the 1980's.)
Nor is Mr. Gilmore the first developer to convert historic buildings Downtown. In the late 80's and early 90's, Ira Yellin blazed the trail by creating 120 apartments in the Homer Laughlin and Million Dollar Theater Building on Broadway. 
But Carol Schatz, president of Downtown's Central City Association, an advocacy organization for businesses and property owners, credits Mr. Gilmore with being the first "to take a crop of contiguous buildings" and try to create a neighborhood. His renovated San Fernando, a 1907 eight-story Renaissance Revival-style pile with a new coat of paint, is currently a lone beacon of upward mobility in a zone of empty, rundown buildings and welfare hotels.
People moving into the San Fernando are attracted to its semi-industrial, open-plan spaces with sandblasted concrete floors, large tiled bathrooms and fully-equipped kitchens. Paul Warner, an artist, shares a $1,400 935-square-foot loft there with his wife, Marie. New York "is the place that everyone wants to live but no one can afford," he said.
"For one-third of the cost, I get a place I like with a great view and great location," he added.
If all goes as planned, Mr. Gilmore, who also has interests in the Hollywood and Vine area, miles west in Hollywood, foresees mixed-income apartments renting for $500 to $6,000 a month joining the San Fernando in the Old Bank District. Also in the works is the El Dorado Hotel -- a project in development with Cedd Moses and Mark Smith, the owners of several trendy bars and restaurants in Los Angeles -- and roof gardens, coffee bars and shops. 
A few blocks north is St. Vibiana's Cathedral, a 19th-century Spanish baroque building damaged in the 1994 earthquake. Mr. Gilmore owns it and plans to turn it into Vibiana Place, a performing arts center and housing complex. He also owns the Palace Theater on Broadway, an ornate 2,200-seat house built for vaudeville in 1911. The Palace, one of 12 historic movie or vaudeville theaters on Broadway, will become the Gilmore Associates new offices next month and later a performing arts center.
"Our challenge is to buy enough real estate and transform enough so it becomes a town unto itself," Mr. Gilmore said.
Of course it has a way to go before it's a town. Mr. Warner says he drives 15 minutes to West Hollywood for groceries. "One advantage is that we are near all the freeways," he said. The Acapulco Gold coffee bar will open in the San Fernando Building next month, but restaurants and bars are few and far between. 
Mr. Gilmore and his third wife, Trish Keefer, who manages properties for another real estate company, plan to occupy a loft on weekdays in the Continental when it is completed this spring. On weekends, however, they plan to return to their Spanish Revival house in the Hollywood Hills. Asked if he would trade that for full-time living downtown, he said that if he were younger, yes. "But at 48 years, with a wife and cats, I'd live in the country," Mr. Gilmore said. He added that he enjoys tending his garden as much as his developments. "I like peace more than I like action," he said.
Such action, to his critics, represents the specter of gentrification. "In order for his plan to work, he's got to push the Skid Row people away from the neighborhood," said Alice Callaghan, a local Episcopal priest who works with the homeless. 
Bud Hayes, chief executive of the S.R.O. Housing Corporation in the Skid Row area, argues that Mr. Gilmore's project is a boon to the neighborhood and will bring amenities, like grocery stores, to the area.
Complaint No. 2: Mr. Gilmore's rentals are overpriced. Spacious lofts in the nearby Spring Towers building owned by Izek Shomof rent for 75 cents to $1 a square foot a month. Lofts in Mr. Gilmore's San Fernando Building rent for around $1.50 a square foot. The difference, he says, helps pay for things like better security.
Complaint No. 3. "The Gilmore Effect." Other developers complain that by drawing so much attention to Downtown, he has contributed to a rise in prices. The Alexandria Hotel, a flophouse on Spring and Fifth, may be the next candidate for developers, with its grand ballroom with a Tiffany stained-glass ceiling. But what will it cost? When Mr. Gilmore began buying in 1997, he paid $10 a square foot; today, prices are $30 to $50 a square foot. 
But Downtown, if it is to succeed, needs thousands, not hundreds, of lofts. And other developers need Mr. Gilmore to succeed, especially if a recession threatens the embryonic project. "He's the brightest object in the downtown sky right now," Paul Solomon, a young developer, said. "And the momentum of the area would be affected to the negative if he were not to succeed."
Mr. Gilmore says he's not worried about failure. "L.A.'s been a movie set for long enough," he said. "Now it's time for it to become a real city."

HEADLINE: World Needs to Add 500 Million Jobs in 10 Years, Report Says 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
With one-third of the world's work force unemployed or underemployed, at least 500 million new jobs will be needed over the next 10 years to accommodate new arrivals in the job market and help reduce global unemployment by half, an international labor group says in a new report.
 The International Labor Office, the headquarters of the International Labor Organization, a United Nations affiliate, issued the report on Tuesday, saying sweeping advances in information technology and communications offer the most promising solution for creating work. 
 Still, its World Employment Report 2001 warned that "the global employment situation remains deeply flawed," because inequalities in access to technology and education are leaving many developing countries behind the industrialized world. 
"Growth cannot in itself be expected to ensure that the needed 500 million jobs are of sufficient quality to bring all the world's workers closer to the enjoyment of decent work," the report said. "To achieve this requires much greater attention to core labor market issues, including investments in human capital, overcoming discrimination and making employment a central goal of economic policy."
To cross the so-called digital divide of the computer age, the report said, governments of developing countries will have to consider policies that would make the new technologies available to their people and equip them with the necessary education and skills. 
"A passive policy stance that leaves to markets alone the direction of change will reinforce divides," the report said.
Duncan Campbell, an economist in the organization's employment strategy department and the senior editor of the report, said: "There are clear positive potentials from these technologies. There are clear opportunities for good. But there are also concerns and worries." 
"No country has succeeded economically without well-educated people," Mr. Campbell added, speaking by telephone from the agency headquarters in Geneva. "We really view education as being the key source of the divide."
The report estimated that fully one-third of the three billion potential workers in the world were "unemployed, underemployed in terms of seeking more work or earn less than is needed to keep their families out of poverty," a subsistence wage level reckoned at $1 a day.
Of those, 160 million are visibly jobless, which, the report said, was 20 million more than at the peak of the Asian financial crisis in 1998, because Asia's population kept growing during the economic downturn.
It further estimated that at least 460 million new young job seekers, two-thirds of them Asian, would join the global work force by 2010. 
But the AIDS pandemic that is sweeping sub-Saharan Africa is widely expected to reduce the number of job seekers there, with losses disproportionately high among professional and other skilled workers.
Although more workers in the United States and other industrialized countries are finding jobs, the report said, unemployment has risen in Latin America and the Caribbean, and it remains high in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In China, the problem has apparently become more visible.
The new technologies, the report added, have the potential to improve women's opportunities. It said women held 27 percent of professional jobs in India's thriving software industry.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Blue-Chip Earnings Reports Put Some Investors on Edge

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors refrained from making any big commitments in the stock market yesterday, leaving stocks little changed as they tried to discern a trend in earnings and the economy.
 Blue chips fluctuated amid a series of bleak profit reports and forecasts. Technology stocks fared better, but they struggled to stay in positive territory. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished slightly lower, down 2.84 points, to 10,646.97. The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.76 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,859.15, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended up 3.90 points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,364.30. 
With blue chips including DuPont and McDonald's issuing downbeat reports, investors were taking few chances. No big-name technology companies reported earnings yesterday.
Analysts say it is hard to predict how coming earnings announcements will affect the market each day. Wall Street's overall mood seems optimistic, but there is some uncertainty about whether bad earnings news has been factored completely into the cheaper prices of many stocks.
"The general tone is positive even though the market is weighing things," said Dan Ascani, president and research director at Global Market Strategists in Gainesville, Ga. "Generally speaking, the market is digesting well."
Investors are most concerned about the future. Shares of many companies that meet or beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations have slipped when those concerns also warned that first-quarter results will be disappointing.
That was the case yesterday with DuPont, which surpassed profit forecasts by a penny a share but said challenging business conditions will pinch earnings into the first half of this year. DuPont shares fell 19 cents, to $41.88.
McDonald's, after warning that the first quarter will be difficult, tumbled $2.06, to $30.81. McDonald's also missed fourth-quarter earnings forecasts by a penny.
Investors are still trading with some caution, but they seem to be growing more confident that profits and the economy will improve, partly because of lower interest rates. The market is hoping that the Federal Reserve will reduce rates for the second time in a month when it meets next week.
"An edge of optimism has come into the market," said A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist at Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. "There's the thought that the economy may have a soft landing as a consequence of the Fed's action."
There is evidence of increasing optimism in the market's recent preference for technology stocks over so-called defensive issues, like drug stocks, that tend to perform better in bearish markets.
The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb fell $1.38, to $64.88, despite beating earnings forecasts by a penny. Analysts say the drug sector has become overpriced as investors sought safer bets during last year's high-technology tumble.
 --------------------

Treasury Bonds Fall
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices fell for the fourth consecutive day as investors said the Federal Reserve might not cut interest rates as much as they had previously thought. 
"The market is shifting expectations from a half-point to a quarter-point" rate cut as investors bet the economy will recover by the second half of the year, said Mitch Stapley, who is adding investment-grade corporate debt to the $3.5 billion he manages at the Kent Funds in Grand Rapids, Mich.
Bond traders expect the Fed to cut rates by at least a quarter of a percentage point at its meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32, to a price of 103 11/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.30 percent from 5.28 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 108 13/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.66 percent from 5.65 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Board Ends Method of Accounting for Mergers 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Financial Accounting Standards Board voted yesterday to eliminate the pooling method of accounting for mergers, a move that was widely expected.
 The accounting board, in a unanimous vote, reaffirmed an earlier decision that had drawn strong opposition from businesses and had led some members of Congress to propose legislation to overturn the decision. 
 But opposition had softened since the board voted to change the other method of accounting for mergers, called purchase accounting, to make it less onerous. 
Companies have tried to avoid using purchase accounting because it often required them to add intangible assets, known as good will, to their balance sheets and then write those assets off over 20 years or more, reducing reported earnings.
But the board decided to allow a company to not write off good will until the company concluded that the value of the asset had been impaired. The move will allow companies to report higher earnings.
The board's chairman, Edmund L. Jenkins, said the change was needed because the purchase method "reflects the underlying economics of business combinations by requiring that the current values of the assets and liabilities exchanged be reported to investors."
"Without the information that the purchase method provides," Mr. Jenkins added, "investors are left in the dark as to the real cost of one company buying another and, as a result, are unable to track future returns on the investment."
When companies used pooling, they combined the balance sheets of the two companies that were merging. As a result, the asset values shown did not reflect the value of the stock that had been exchanged to buy the company being acquired. In purchase accounting, the value of the assets on the balance sheet of the merged company reflect the price that was paid for the acquired company.
The board also announced that two new members had been named to the seven-member board, to serve five-year terms beginning on July 1. They are John K. Wulff, the chief financial officer of Union Carbide, and Katherine Schipper, an accounting professor at Duke University.
They succeed two retiring members, Gaylen N. Larson, a former financial executive with Household International, and Gerhard G. Mueller, a former professor at the University of Washington.

HEADLINE: Lucent Announces A Spartan Strategy To Put Itself Right 

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Struggling to regain its former glory, Lucent Technologies announced a broad revamping yesterday that included eliminating 10,000 jobs -- about 9.4 percent of its workers.
 The plan, which includes a restructuring charge of at least $1.2 billion, is meant to help the company climb back to the top of the digital economy after a series of damaging missteps. One of the world's biggest makers of communications equipment, Lucent is trying to streamline its operations to compete better against powerhouses like Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks of Canada. 
 Lucent said that while some job cuts would come through attrition, most would be layoffs; it said it wanted to notify affected employees by early March. Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., employs roughly 17,000 people in that state. About 1,500 of those jobs will be eliminated. Throughout Lucent, many cuts will come in overlapping sales and marketing groups. 
For a few years after Lucent was spun off from AT&T in 1996, its stock, profits and profile soared as it expanded overseas and began providing gear for the Internet and a variety of data networks.
But the ride did not last. While Lucent put on the gloss of a new-economy dynamo, under the hood lurked many old Ma Bell mechanisms and mentalities. Last year, the wheels fell off. It dismissed its chairman and chief executive, Richard A. McGinn, and warned four separate times that it would not meet its financial targets. Lucent's market value, which at one point in late 1999 had surpassed $270 billion, fell below $50 billion.
Now Henry B. Schacht, who guided Lucent in its infancy, is back as chairman and chief executive. And yesterday, even as Lucent announced disappointing results for the quarter ended in December, he prescribed the bitter medicine he hopes will return it to vigor.
"In the broadest sense, what we've said is that we have good customers, good technology and good people in a rising market," Mr. Schacht said in an interview yesterday. "We have a serious focus-and-execution problem. We will use 2001 fiscal as a transitional rebuilding year.
"We are back in the process of putting the company back on track," he added.
Lucent's shares were among the most actively traded yesterday, but moved up only 81 cents, to $19.63, on the New York Stock Exchange.
In addition to the 10,000 job cuts, Lucent said that 6,000 employees, mostly in Columbus, Ohio, and Oklahoma City, would soon be working for different companies as Lucent tries to sell all or part of their factories by the end of September.
Lucent has already said it intends to spin off its microelectronics and optical components businesses into a new company called Agere, which will take with it about 16,500 workers. That spinoff, combined with the job cuts and factory sales, would shrink Lucent's payroll from about 123,000 workers today to about 90,500 by the fall.
Lucent also said it intended to eliminate some product lines. To cover the cost of all these moves, it said yesterday that it would take a restructuring charge of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion at the end of the current quarter. Lucent would not say how the charge broke down.
By comparison, Lucent had earnings of $1.2 billion for all of its fiscal 2000, ended in September.
The company offered few details about which product lines it planned to scrap, though it did say that one of its optical communications products would be folded into a different internal organization and that much of the company's "messaging" development (mostly voice-mail software) had been moved from Milpitas, Calif., to Chicago and Columbus. One person close to the company said that additional announcements of discontinued products could be expected in the next several months.
Lucent's hope is that the job cuts, product cuts and internal streamlining will allow it to trim annual costs by $2 billion by the end of the year.
Cutting costs is important at Lucent for a lot of reasons -- not least that its revenue is shrinking.
Discounting the impact of acquisitions and spinoffs, the company said its revenue from continuing operations was $5.84 billion in the most recent quarter. Not only was that 26 percent less than the $7.91 billion in the period a year earlier, it was also about $500 million less than what the company told Wall Street to expect on Dec. 21.
Some analysts questioned yesterday how the company could, at the time, have misjudged its revenue by so much when it was just 10 days from the end of the quarter.
"The first reaction is, 'What happened to the December quarter revenue?' " said Steven D. Levy of Lehman Brothers. "The second reaction is that the restructuring charge-cost savings are bigger than I thought, which is a positive. I think they need to go deep, and I think it's also an indication of how deep the problems are."
In explaining the revenue shortfall, Lucent said some contracts it had expected simply did not come through. But tellingly, Mr. Schacht added that Lucent had chosen to pass up some sales opportunities because it would have had to offer bigger discounts than it felt comfortable giving.
One symptom of Lucent's decline in recent years was its offering of ever more aggressive discounts at the end of quarters to help it meet its financial targets. That practice essentially cannibalized Lucent's future prospects for short-term gain.
Discounting the impact of acquisitions and spinoffs, Lucent said its continuing operations lost $1.02 billion, or 30 cents a share, in the most recent quarter, down from a profit of $1.08 billion, or 33 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to lose 27 cents a share.
Including the impact of all deals and one-time gains and losses, Lucent formally reported a loss of $395 million, or 12 cents a share, down from earnings of $1.25 billion, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
As part of its restructuring plan, Lucent announced yesterday that it had secured a new $4.5 billion credit line arranged by J. P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney. In an interview, Deborah Hopkins, Lucent's chief financial officer, said the new debt would subordinate Lucent's old obligations. That means that if Lucent melted down, holders of the new credit line would have a claim on Lucent's assets before holders of its older debt.
That arrangement appeared to concern some analysts yesterday, who worried that it could prompt a further downgrade of Lucent's credit; Lucent's credit rating was reduced last month by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, two major bond-rating agencies. Ms. Hopkins declined to comment on that possibility.

HEADLINE: Sol Libsohn, 86, Photographer Who Captured Ordinary Life 

BYLINE:  By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Sol Libsohn, an early documentary photographer whose images of ordinary Americans appeared in many national publications, died on Sunday in Princeton, N.J. He was 86.
 A New Yorker by birth, Mr. Libsohn taught himself how to take pictures after a neighbor gave him a Kodak Brownie. After attending City College, he went to work for the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program that enlisted thousands of unemployed artists and artisans in the depths of the Depression. 
 Starting out as an artists' model for some W.P.A. muralists, he was soon drafted to record images of New Yorkers coping with hard times. In 1936 his experiences in the W.P.A. led him and others to found the Photo League, an organization of photographers committed to the documentary style and in-depth examinations of contemporary urban subjects.
Toward the end of World War II, Mr. Libsohn joined a team of photographers at Standard Oil Company of New Jersey working on a novel documentary project whose theme was "There is a drop of oil in the life of everyone." The team, led by Roy Stryker, included, apart from Mr. Libsohn, Gordon Parks, Esther Bubley, Russell Lee, John Vachon and Todd Webb and was given amazingly free rein by its corporate sponsor.
Amassing about 6,000 images in five years, Mr. Libsohn created, among other things, a haunting series called "The Trucking Story," spending two months riding and living with truckers on their cross-country runs. The photographs included late-night portraits of the drivers and their vehicles, waitresses and diners, roadside attractions and small towns along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. 
Another of his projects captured the hurly-burly life in the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
Starting in the early 1950's, Mr. Libsohn worked as a freelancer for Fortune magazine and Ladies' Home Journal, among many others. His work was included in "The Family of Man," the landmark photographic exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1955, and was the subject of a recent retrospective in Doubletake magazine. In 1975, Mr. Libsohn became the first photographer to be awarded a fellowship to the MacDowell artists colony.
Mr. Libsohn taught photography at Princeton University and was represented by the Howard Greenberg Gallery in SoHo.
He is survived by his companion, Bess Tremper; a daughter, Sara Prestopino of Roosevelt, N.J.; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Crusade to Revitalize the City Opera 

 BODY:
Running an opera company a few feet from the Metropolitan Opera House is not easy. Over the last five years, Paul Kellogg has done it by trying to offer something different, even as he has presented opera staples. 
As general and artistic director of the New York City Opera, Mr. Kellogg, 63, has made an effort to reach young people. 
 He has said he was willing to lose money on student discounts to build future audiences. And he has been trying to attract these new opera-goers with younger performers and a repertoire with unorthodox offerings like Benjamin Britten's "Paul Bunyan." 
 Mr. Kellogg inherited an institution $5 million in debt and in need of new artistic direction. In perhaps his most controversial decision, he addressed the poor acoustics of the 2,700-seat New York State Theater, which the City Opera shares with the New York City Ballet, by approving the installation of an electronic sound enhancement system before the 1999 season, a measure that he said he hoped would be temporary. 
Mr. Kellogg has been credited with helping to revitalize the company by drawing new talent and new audiences, building the endowment and erasing the debt.
"There's been no deficit for five years," Mr. Kellogg said yesterday. "We're now raising 50 percent more than when I started." 
While hardly as confrontational as Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, Mr. Kellogg suggested yesterday that he was prepared to give as good as he gets. "We're not going to be dictated to by one person or one institution," he said.

HEADLINE: A Grocer Amid Mideast Outrage; 
Sainsbury Becomes Target of Rumors and Israel Boycott

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Mohammed Allam was working his usual shift at the fish counter of Sainsbury's two months ago when the supermarket in the upscale Maadi district here was attacked by stone-throwing youths.
 Inflamed by rumors that Sainsbury's, the British-based retailer, was a Jewish-owned backer of Israel, the angry youths broke windows and left customers frightened. But no one was hurt, Mr. Allam said. The police came quickly, and they stood guard outside the store every day for the next month. 
 "The Egyptian government protected us," he emphasized, shrugging off the incident, as he put the last artful touches on his display of grouper, snapper, squid and prawns. 
But at corporate headquarters in London, the attack was taken quite seriously. It was not the first time that one of the newly opened Sainsbury's stores in Egypt had been attacked. A consumer boycott movement, also propelled by anger against Israel, had already singled out Sainsbury's, even though the company disavows any particular Jewish or Israel connections.
At stake in the attacks is not just the $150 million investment here by Sainsbury's corporate parent, J. Sainsbury P.L.C., which many analysts, considering it a distraction, would be happy to see the company shed. Even more at risk is Egypt's campaign to lure foreign investors into a growing but challenging domestic market.
Here, Sainsbury's troubles, which could lead the company to pull out of Egypt entirely, are seen as an object lesson in the regional economic reverberations of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a parable of globalization.
For the Egyptian government, and for Egyptian industrialists who are seeking deep-pocketed foreign partners, a withdrawal by Sainsbury's would be a deeply embarrassing setback for a country that is trying to change its image as one that is open in theory but hostile in practice to outside investors. With the great exception of the oil and gas business, the magnet for most foreign investment here, Egypt has failed to attract the billions in private capital it says it needs to build competitive export industries and efficient local service industries.
Shortly after the assault on the Maadi store in mid-November, Sir Peter Davis, the recently appointed chief executive of Sainsbury, said he was "reviewing all strategic options for reducing our financial exposure to this region."
And on Jan. 16, company executives told Egypt's prime minister that Sainsbury was considering selling its Egyptian chain, or, failing that, severely diluting its holdings and entering a restructured partnership with local investors, according to Sainsbury officials at the meeting.
It was just a year ago that the retailer -- a venerable supermarket chain with more than 100,000 employees worldwide and annual revenue of $:13.5 billion, or nearly $20 billion at current rates -- began opening scores of stores throughout this sprawling city.
Some were new; others were acquired from Edge, a sleepy, state-owned retailer in which Sainsbury acquired an 80 percent interest in 1999. Sainsbury now has more than 100 outlets in middle-income Cairo neighborhoods, making it the nation's biggest supermarket chain, with 2,500 employees and sales exceeding $100 million the first year.
In contrast to the fancy import-oriented Egyptian supermarkets in upper-class districts, Sainsbury opened many stores in gritty neighborhoods, with a no-frills offering of fresh local goods at consistent discounts. But the Egyptian subsidiary posted a $15 million operating loss for the first half of 2000, in part because of problems with goods clearing customs and with obtaining building permits. The losses have continued, exacerbated by an organized campaign against the company by the anti-Israel protesters.
Business analysts here say one reason the government at first appeared reluctant to quell the protests was that the anti-Sainsbury sentiments were shared by influential midsize Egyptian retailers, who feared that the chain's entry was setting a precedent for further competition from big, cost-cutting foreign retailers.
"Getting out could be less costly than sticking with it for the next few years," said Sara Carter, who tracks Sainsbury's stock for Merrill Lynch in London. "The problem is not knowing the marketplace, and not being welcome there."
The company, which owns the Shaw's and Star regional chains in the New England states, was already suffering from its poor recent performance at home. Once the leading grocery chain in Britain, Sainsbury's is now second to Tesco and falling. Wal-Mart, which entered Britain in mid-1999, with the acquisition of the Asda stores, is threatening to surpass Sainsbury in an increasingly competitive British market. 
"A lot of people wondered what on earth they were doing in Egypt to begin with," said David McCarthy, a London-based analyst for Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. "Why waste management time and money on Egypt when you are losing market share at home?"
But if Sainsbury decides to give up on its relatively small, troublesome subsidiary, it would be an unexpected triumph for the leaders of the consumer protest movement here, who have made Sainsbury an unlikely focus of an anti-Israel, anti-American campaign.
"If they withdraw, it would be a victory," said Ashraf el-Bayoumi, a founding member of an ad hoc group begun last fall to penalize foreign companies for what it regards as their indirect financial support of Israel. 
With no Israeli goods with brand names available for political reprisals, the group -- the General Committee for the Boycott of American and Zionist Goods and Companies -- has identified what it acknowledges is a usual-suspects list of American corporate targets: Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Nike and Marlboro (even though the cigarettes sold here are made in Egypt by a state company). McDonald's and other American fast-food outlets here -- KFC, Pizza Hut, Hardee's -- have suffered a noticeable though not calamitous drop in business, American diplomats say.
The ad hoc group is also urging a boycott of Levi jeans, though not because Levi Strauss was started by an American Jew, supporters insist. Another American target is Procter & Gamble's Ariel detergent, though not, they say, because of the Israeli rightist leader Ariel Sharon, a branding coincidence that has apparently caused Ariel's sales to fall elsewhere in the Arab world.
The boycott targets were selected for their "visibility and symbolic value" as icons of American capitalism, said Dr. Bayoumi, an American-educated chemistry professor and dedicated opponent of the trend toward globalism. But Sainsbury's was different, said Soheir Morsy, an anthropologist and another founder of the boycott group. It was chosen, she contended, "spontaneously by the people."
Even before the fall's anti-Israeli protests, Sainsbury's had come under fire as an unwelcome example of the disruptive impact of free trade and foreign investment. Small Cairo retailers asserted that they were being driven to bankruptcy by Sainsbury's aggressive advertising and discount sales, and leftist intellectuals like Dr. Morsy echoed their complaints. "They have hurt thousands of Egyptian families," she said.
The boycott organizers say they oppose the use of violence and accept statements by Sainsbury that it is a large, publicly traded company with a long British history but no particular Jewish or Israel connections. Yet as one of the most visible examples of British investment here, Sainsbury's is a natural focus for protests against Prime Minister Tony Blair's support of Washington's negotiating initiatives in the Middle East, they said.
Dr. Morsy and Dr. Bayoumi, who studied and taught in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Cambridge, Mass., respectively, are longtime observers of American college-town politics. They cite as their models the California grape boycotts by Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers and campaigns urging the divestiture of stock in companies associated with South Africa under apartheid rule. 
And they see their movement as within a tradition of Western political protest. But they acknowledge that Sainsbury never became a target of popular wrath until this fall, when sentiment erupted against the Israeli military response to protest riots in the Palestinian territories, and stories spread about the company's supposed Israeli links.
Some Muslim clerics issued edicts against shopping at Sainsbury, a campaign the company tried to counteract by posting passages from the Koran on supermarket walls. But business analysts here and shoppers who still patronize Sainsbury's agree that it has been hit harder by the movement than any other foreign company here.
"They were slowly changing the face of Egyptian retailing," a European economic analyst here said. Then, alluding to clerical decrees, the analyst continued: "They knew they would have to deal with the bureaucratic inefficiencies that everyone else faces here. What they didn't anticipate were fatwas and boycotts and Jewish conspiracy theories."
In October, the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce endorsed the boycott, putting pressure on 25 affiliated local businesses to end their imports of Israeli merchandise. President Hosni Mubarak, who has worked to block new anti-Israel boycott initiatives at Arab diplomatic forums, even expressed public sympathy for the anti-Israel consumer movement -- this despite the fact that Israeli energy companies are citing the boycott as a reason for Israel not to import Egyptian natural gas, a deal potentially worth billions of dollars. 
But Mr. Mubarak warned against extending the boycott to American or European products.
"The decision to boycott foreign goods should be guided by the public interest and not romantic notions," he told the newspaper Al Ahram last month. And Prime Minister Atef Obeid expressed hope that Sainsbury would remain in the country.
Executives at Sainsbury's here and in London declined to be interviewed. But foreign experts familiar with the company say it believes that the government could have acted earlier and more forcefully against the boycott campaign.
"The Egyptians understand that there is a bad message there," a Western diplomat said. "What they don't understand is that you don't solve the problem by saying we love foreign investment. You have to do what it takes to attract and keep the investment."

HEADLINE: Redesigned Georgia Flag Is Advanced By House 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The state flag of Georgia, which has worn a large Confederate cross since the days of desegregation, was abruptly redesigned today by the Georgia House of Representatives, shrinking the divisive symbol and bringing 45 years of angry debate to a surprisingly peaceful conclusion.
 If the Senate approves the new design, as it is expected to do in a few days, the old Confederate cross will be reduced to a small historical relic at the bottom of the flag, alongside images of other flags that have flown over the state. Approval will avert the threats of an economic boycott of the state by civil rights groups, sparing Georgia what South Carolina endured before it lowered the Confederate battle flag from atop its Capitol last year. 
 "I think this is going to change the image of this state all over the world," said Representative Calvin Smyre, one of the leading black negotiators of the compromise design. 
After decades of public argument over whether the Confederate symbol represents a genteel Southern heritage or the oppression of slavery, the compromise was reached behind closed doors, and not a word of the new design leaked out before this morning. By keeping the design a secret, House leaders said, they were able to mute the inevitable opposition and keep pressure on legislators to a minimum.
The House approved the change on a 94-to-82 vote that brought together black urban Democrats, suburban white Republicans and enough reluctant white rural Democrats to form a majority. For years white Democrats, fearful of political retribution, shied away from the issue, but today several emerged to argue for a new era.
Chief among them was Gov. Roy Barnes, who has been publicly silent on the issue but was apparently working closely behind the scenes in favor of the compromise. Hours before the vote, Mr. Barnes made an unusual appearance on the House floor to plead for a new flag.
"The Confederacy is part of our history, but it is not two-thirds of our history," Mr. Barnes said, invoking the memory of his Confederate great-grandfather but saying the state's future would be tarnished by dwelling in the past. "Defeating this compromise will confirm the worst that has been said about us, and in the process, dishonor a brave people. Adopt this flag and our people will be united as one rather than divided by race and hatred."
Although Georgia's carefully guarded compromise was unlike South Carolina's raucous public debate, the framework was essentially the same, and it says much about how issues of racial symbolism are settled in a changed South. In South Carolina, the battle flag was reduced in size and moved to a less prominent flagpole in front of the Capitol, just as the symbol was shrunk but preserved on the new Georgia design. The bitterest opponents of the Confederate symbol ultimately recognized that it has a profound historical meaning to many whites, including those whose racial views have moderated over the years.
All 36 members of the House black caucus supported the new design as a necessary compromise, although a few expressed their distress that any relic of the Confederacy remained.
"I'm not 100 percent thrilled about it myself, but we had to throw that in to give the rural white legislators a sense of victory," said Representative Tyrone Brooks, a Democrat from Atlanta who has spent years trying to change the flag.
Denmark Groover, the House floor leader in 1956 and an architect of the current flag, appeared at the Capitol today to urge the adoption of the new design. At the time, Mr. Groover said, he was as much of a segregationist as anyone in Georgia, and acknowledged that the Confederate symbol was added mostly out of defiance to federal integration orders. But he said that he and the state had vastly changed in those 45 years.
"I've learned in all my years -- and it took a while to learn it -- that I have to live with all my neighbors," said Mr. Groover, 78. "It's time to end this cauldron of discord that adversely affects our lives and the future of our children and grandchildren."
The new flag, if approved, will be dominated by the inoffensive state seal on a field of blue. At the bottom of the flag, on a yellow banner bearing the words "Georgia's History," will be small images of five other flags: the 1777 United States flag, the pre-1879 Georgia flag, the pre-1956 state flag, the current flag with the Confederate cross, and the United States flag. 
In a last-minute design change, the House voted to add the words "In God We Trust."

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Renovation Plan Has Opera Houses at Odds 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
No one is yet calling it an opera war, however operatic it may be. But yesterday the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera were singing different tunes, and suddenly the stately granite plaza that separates the two resident companies of Lincoln Center seemed too small for comfort. 
 At issue was the $1.5 billion Lincoln Center redevelopment plan -- which the Met threw into turmoil this week by backing out -- and specifically the question of whether the project should include up to $200 million for a new theater to house City Opera. The company, a world-class institution but always in the Met's shadow, performs at the New York State Theater, which was built for ballet to muffle footfalls, not to project arias. 
 Yesterday Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met, while holding out hope that the dispute with Lincoln Center could be settled, said he was concerned that City Opera was not in good enough financial shape to support a new theater and that, because the Met pays 30 percent of Lincoln Center's shared operating costs, any City Opera debt might land on the Met's doorstep. 
Those views were promptly contested by Paul Kellogg, artistic and general director of City Opera, who said he already had pledges for more than $70 million to build an opera house that could be located on or off the Lincoln Center campus. He said his institution was flush with a cash reserve and endowment of $10 million and growing, and he asked if the Met might back off.
"They have enough troubles of their own," he said. "Leave us to solve it."
The contretemps sets the Met, a cultural behemoth with an annual budget of nearly $200 million and an ensemble considered among the finest in the world, against a scrappy, risk-taking company of no small artistic stature itself, founded by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia to bring opera to the people.
Even Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was drawn gently into the fray yesterday. Asked at his daily briefing what he would do about the drama embroiling his beloved Metropolitan Opera and Lincoln Center, he said: "Sing an aria. A happy one." Then he said, "I think we can play a role in helping them work that out." 
Lincoln Center, meanwhile, sought anew yesterday to quell the discord that was threatening the redevelopment just a week after formation of a constituent operating corporation and the pledge of $240 million in city financial support, to be spread over the 10 years the work is expected to take.
Replying to a letter of withdrawal from the project from Mr. Volpe and the Met's president, Paul M. Montrone, Lincoln Center's three top officials -- Beverly Sills, the chairwoman; Gordon J. Davis, the president; and Marshall Rose, chairman of the redevelopment corporation -- disputed the Met's claims that it had been excluded from decision making. They urged the Met to reconsider and called for a meeting next week to iron out differences. 
In a conference call interview, the three officials portrayed the dispute as part of the normal give and take in any complex project. "Of course we're having ups and downs," Ms. Sills said. But, she said, "this project is going to happen."
Mr. Davis added: "It's not operatic. It's the way Lincoln Center was created. It was created out of debate, argument, fears and aspirations and eventually common understanding."
But their reply letter and the way it became available to outsiders seemed only to create new friction.
"The Metropolitan Opera will not enter into a discussion or debate regarding any communication which Lincoln Center addressed to the Met but saw fit to fax to the print media simultaneously," Mr. Volpe said in a telephone interview. "We stand by our letter." 
In the Met's letter to Lincoln Center earlier this week, Mr. Volpe and Mr. Montrone contended that the Met had been misled and "consistently excluded from meaningful involvement" in the redevelopment, and said it was immediately withdrawing from the project and would plan its own minimal refurbishment.
The public skirmish of the opera houses began with Mr. Volpe's questioning, during an interview yesterday, of City Opera's exploration of a new building as part of the redevelopment project.
"If the City Opera wants to build a building, have its own opera house and be off campus, that's fine with me," he said. "The question I've raised is, If they can find the money to build a new building, feasibility study or not, how do you know they can find the money to keep it running? If they were to go bust, who would have the responsibility of maintaining the building -- would it be Lincoln Center and the constituents and we'd be responsible for 30 percent? No, I can't be put in that position."
Mr. Kellogg, to whom the comments were relayed for response, struck back. "From our point of view, it's quite viable," he said, citing pledges of more than $70 million and City Opera's share of about 9 percent of the city's promised $240 million. A new building, he said, is estimated to cost $150 million to $200 million.
A study is now examining the economics as well as possible sites, he said, adding, "We're quite confident in our ability to support a house."
Mr. Kellogg said that since taking over in 1996 he had erased a $5 million deficit, raising $15 million to build the reserves to $10 million. He is operating with an annual budget of $35 million, he said. "It's our responsibility to maintain the theater, no one else's," he said. "It's up to us. The burden should not be the Met's."
He said that after struggling for decades in a theater whose stage was designed for dancers, "we're not about to give up the amount pledged." It is time, he said, for the company to have its own house. "I'm confident it's going to happen one way or another," he said.
Told about Mr. Volpe's concerns regarding a new opera house, Ms. Sills, whose long singing career at the City Opera led to her appointment as its general director from 1979 to 1988, said the pledges of financial support for a new City Opera home carried considerable weight. "There's $70 million worth of viability, not liability," she said.
Yet, she said, referring to Mr. Volpe, "Joe has a perfect right to ask questions -- we all do."
"I'm never offended by questions," she said, pausing theatrically before adding, "but sometimes by the answers." 
Ms. Sills, who at 71 waves off questions about retiring from the job of raising the billion or more private dollars needed for the redevelopment project, also sought yesterday to soothe the passions that have troubled the effort. "It's unrealistic to think it could go without bumps and lumps," she said. 
She and Mr. Volpe are old friends, she said. "We actually had a two-hour lunch recently and didn't mention Lincoln Center once," she said.
Mr. Volpe, who has also made a point of praising Mr. Sills, said yesterday that he had no choice but to voice his grievances dramatically.
"If you say to people like Lincoln Center, 'We object to this, we object to that,' and you do it in a nice, gentlemanly, businesslike fashion, they ignore you," he said. 
In their letter of resignation from the project, Mr. Volpe and Mr. Montrone said the Met had been excluded from some important decisions about financing and other issues. 
Lincoln Center, in turn, provided a copy of a project resolution stating that important decisions required agreement of each member in writing. But Mr. Volpe said yesterday that despite the provision, the Met often had been bypassed.
"Of course, my hope is that we can work together," he said. "If we can't, we can't, but if we can, it would be so much easier." But that was before Lincoln Center's letter. 
If the affair were an opera, he was asked, what might it be? "I don't know," he said. "War and Peace?"

HEADLINE: New York Area Has a Cushion, Economists Say 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Last week, Jupiter Media Metrix joined the list of Internet companies in Manhattan's Silicon Alley planning to cut jobs. On Tuesday, AOL Time Warner said it would eliminate some positions at its magazine division. That same day, J. C. Penney announced that it would close a store in Westchester County.
 But those were just the preliminary rounds to the main event that hit the New York area yesterday: Lucent Technologies said it would lay off about 1,500 people in New Jersey, or 9 percent of its work force in the state. And Henry B. Schacht, who recently returned as chief executive of Lucent, the company he ran in the heady days after its spinoff from AT&T in 1996, said it would probably take at least a year for Lucent to turn the corner. 
 The downturn of the nation's economy seems to have arrived in the New York City area, and analysts said the region, which has been enjoying a boom in recent years, should expect to see slower growth in 2001. 
The International Business Machines Corporation may be planning to add thousands of jobs at its offices along the Hudson River, but most companies will probably add fewer jobs this year, and more announcements of layoffs are expected.
But as the slowdown begins, economists say the New York region is not expected to suffer as much as many other parts of the country. 
There are several reasons, they said. The city and its suburbs rely less than other regions on manufacturing, a volatile sector that has been shrinking. Real estate companies around New York have also been more conservative than they were in the 1980's, decreasing the chances that thousands of offices will sit vacant during a slowdown or a recession. 
Despite the layoffs at Lucent, New Jersey's labor market is expected to stay tight, thanks in part to growth in the pharmaceutical companies.
"If there's a downturn," said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, "it's going to be a milder downturn in the region" than in the rest of the United States.
The biggest threat to the region may come from the same place that has been the biggest source of strength: Wall Street. 
The region now relies on financial services more than ever, and a further downturn in stocks and a decline in financial transactions could lead to pay cuts and layoffs on Wall Street that would ripple throughout the region, analysts say.
So far, Wall Street firms have not announced many layoffs, though large investment banks said they would hire fewer people this year. 
The tourism and media industries also account for hundreds of thousands of jobs, particularly in New York City, although those jobs pay less and play a smaller role in the economy as a result. Both tourism and media companies can suffer in a slowdown, as people cut back on vacations, and companies spend less on advertising. 
But for now, New York's economy is showing few signs of slowing, even as evidence mounts of more tepid growth in the suburbs.
Last year, companies in New York City added 88,000 jobs, helping to lower the unemployment rate to 5.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the start of 1993, the unemployment rate was above 11 percent.
Even as employment growth slowed across the rest of the country in 2000, the number of jobs in New York City's private sector grew at a faster pace than at any point during the previous decade. 
"We haven't seen job growth figures this strong in the 50 years we've been tracking the economy," said John L. Wieting, the New York regional commissioner for the jobs bureau.
The picture is not quite as pretty in the suburbs. 
Across the region -- including suburbs in Connecticut, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties -- job growth slowed to below 2 percent for most of last year. Before March of last year, it had exceeded 2 percent for 32 consecutive months, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa., that tracks economic statistics.
In New Jersey, where employment growth of 1.2 percent trailed the nation's job growth of 1.6 percent, the unemployment rate remained at 3.9 percent last month, just under the national average of 4 percent. 
And rather than suggesting weakness, Mr. Wieting said, the falloff in job growth was partly a result of companies being unable to find enough skilled workers.
Most of the 1,500 Lucent employees who will lose their jobs in New Jersey, out of 10,000 across the company, work in sales or marketing. 
"These are people with skills still in demand in the rest of the economy," Mr. Hughes said. 
Manufacturing workers, on the other hand, have struggled to find new jobs because the overall sector is shrinking around the United States.
Still, the loss of a job is almost always traumatic, employment experts said, and even in a strong economy, people are often forced to take a new position with a lower salary. 
"It's a hard time," Richard Rawson, Lucent's senior vice president and general counsel, said yesterday. "The mood is somber, serious."
Complicating the task for Lucent workers, the economy has clearly slowed, even if the employment statistics do not reflect the change. 
Last month, for example, New York municipal officials predicted annual growth of 3 percent for the city, down from more than 5 percent last year. Nationally, most economists expect growth to be under 3 percent, and some are predicting a recession during the first half of the year.
"Employment data is notoriously poor at capturing any turning point in the economy," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com. In New York and elsewhere, Mr. Zandi added, "my guess is that the data hasn't caught up to what's going on."
In Manhattan, brokers said apartments are selling for less than they did last year. Revenue from television and magazine advertising is growing at a slower rate, agency executives said. And layoff announcements have become more frequent.
But Mr. Hughes said the region would probably weather this slowdown better than it did the recession that hit the region in the late 1980's and did not really end until the early 1990's. Then, many local companies, including those on Wall Street, entered the downturn with bloated payrolls that were cut sharply.
Similarly, the real estate boom of the 1980's led to overbuilding. The vacancy rate for the most desirable offices in midtown Manhattan was below 4 percent for much of 2000, according to Economy.com. A decade ago, as the recession began, it was nearly 20 percent.
As a result, this slowdown should look more like the recession of the early 1980's, when New York suffered less than other parts of country because of its smaller manufacturing base, Mr. Hughes added.
Either way, New York's service-heavy economy will put the region on a different economic timetable.
"New York is always slower to feel the effects of a recession and slower to come out of recession," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.
For most economic analysts, their nightmares revolve around Wall Street. In the last decade, New York and its suburbs have gained as other financial centers, like Chicago, have declined.
Last year, the financial services industries accounted for 23 percent of income in the metropolitan region, according to Economy.com, up from 15 percent a decade ago. 
Like an uncorked Champagne bottle, the fizz is expected to slowly go out of the local economy. But it probably won't break.
"The bull market has gone flat," Mr. Zandi said. "Wall Street should follow, and the economy soon after that."

HEADLINE: California's Power Crisis Replays a Familiar Theme 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
California is long used to fires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, riots, mud slides and mockery from most of the other 49 states and the world. But no problem in a century and a half of statehood can quite compare to the electricity crisis gripping the Golden State. 
 As California endures its ninth straight day of an official power emergency with no easy end in sight, things have come to this: the 35 million residents of the nation's most populous state and the world's seventh largest economy are being urged to watch the Super Bowl in groups to avoid rolling blackouts at the hours of peak demand. 
 The truth has dawned only gradually that California, the epicenter of the nation's booming high tech economy, is subject to the episodic daily failure of a vital piece of its modern infrastructure that would not seem surprising in Bangladesh but still feels mostly surreal here.
"It's not just an economic story," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a series of histories of the California experience, who said that even the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 was not so daunting. 
"It's a cultural and imaginative story," Mr. Starr said. "Once again, Californians have to be alerted to the fact that they have to earn California, that it doesn't come for free. Massachusetts knows that. New York knows that. Any place where it snows knows that. Californians have to learn that again and again." 
This was not supposed to be the time for that lesson. A decade after a brutal recession and a series of natural disasters that felt like Biblical plagues, California has been on a roll, with a $5 billion surplus in state coffers, record low unemployment, resurgent optimism and predictions of phenomenal growth. The state's economy grew at 6 percent last year, 1.5 percentage points above the national economy, and pronouncements that the California Dream was dead gave way to warnings that the challenge of the new century would be managing plenty.
In fact, it is growth, at least in part, that has fueled the current crisis. Demand for electricity outpaced older power plants, while a botched experiment with partial price deregulation and longstanding environmental opposition combined to create disincentives to build new power plants or create cheaper wholesale prices through competition. Instead, wholesale electricity prices have spiraled out of control, pushing the state's two major private utilities, which have been barred from raising retail rates, to the brink of bankruptcy. 
"You have a first-world economy that's suddenly been plunged into a third-world economic environment," said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. "There were some early warning signs, but we were probably too busy reading our own press clippings to pay attention." 
Indeed, though it powers everything from the marquees of Hollywood to the factories and Internet servers of Silicon Valley, electricity itself is so invisible as to be taken for granted. Unlike water, which has historically been thought of as the state's essential resource, it cannot be stored in underground aquifers or behind dams, but must be generated and distributed constantly.
The state's two largest utilities, Southern California Edison and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, saddled with debt, have been shut out of making long-term purchases at the most favorable prices, and instead have had to scramble on the spot market. In just six days, the state has run through about one-third of the $400 million it set aside on emergency basis last week to buy power and pass it on to the utilities. And though the Bush administration extended a federal order requiring power producers to sell surplus electricity and natural gas to California, that reprieve is set to expire in two weeks.
Though there have not been long-lasting nighttime blackouts, public patience is wearing thin. A recent statewide Field Poll found that the proportion of Californians who think the state is headed in the right direction has dropped from its average of nearly 6 in 10 voters last year to just over 4 in 10 now. Another survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, found that as many Californians -- fully one-quarter of adults statewide -- cite electricity prices and deregulation as the No. 1 issue facing the state as cite public schools and education, long the paramount concern here. In past surveys, electricity had not even surfaced.
"It's a problem that's come out of nowhere and it's put all the other issues in the state on hold for now," said Mark Baldassare, the institute's survey director. "It has already shown signs of draining much of the rest of our viable resources, the terrific surpluses that we were looking to as a source of solving problems from a lack of roads and infrastructure to new schools and education." 
"Here we are in the heart of the new economy," Mr. Baldassare added, "and we're spending our money furiously just to keep the lights on. It seems as if everything we learn about this, the fixes are more and more complicated."
No one will bear the brunt of those complications more than Gov. Gray Davis, the placid Democratic centrist who has presided over boom times with high approval ratings since taking office two years ago, but who had yet to be tested in a crunch. In the current crisis, Mr. Davis has been criticized in many quarters as moving too slowly and has vowed to oppose electricity rate increases at virtually all costs, a goal some other prominent politicians consider unrealistic, since higher rates would help force conservation. The State Legislature, which approved the deregulation plan four years ago, has struggled with potential solutions, including having the state take over the hydroelectric plants or transmission systems, but no consensus has emerged.
"I'd been saying this is the worst crisis a governor had faced since the Medfly, but that doesn't do it justice anymore," said Dan Schnur, a longtime aide to former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who was in office when deregulation was approved. "This is going to sound partisan, but it's just unflattering analysis: Davis has never had to make an unpopular decision. He came in during a period of extraordinary economic growth, where the government's biggest problem was how to divide up its surplus, and now he's in a situation where there are no palatable options available and he's having huge difficulty."
Mr. Davis has insisted that his deliberate approach will bear fruit, and has refused to accept what could be the quick but politically explosive step of raising retail electric rates in a state with a strong tradition of consumer activism and anti-tax sentiment. The Field Poll found that nearly 6 in 10 Californians believe the crisis is more an effort by energy companies to force higher rates than a shortage resulting from increased demand and not enough power generation. Most political experts predict that next year's statewide ballot, when Mr. Davis is running for re-election, is apt to be studded with proposals for handling electricity rates and supplies, any one of which could prompt heavy spending by competing groups and roil the political waters.
One of the oddities of the crisis is that Los Angeles, the state's largest city and its most economically and culturally dominant one, has been largely immune, since its municipal utility, the Department of Water and Power, was not subject to deregulation, has its own sources of generation and has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of surplus electricity for use in other parts of the state. But soon enough, experts predict, it will feel the cost of the power crisis as state revenues that might have gone to repair roads or build new schools are diverted to buy electricity. 
In the longer term, Mr. Starr, the historian, said: "Anybody who wants to put money on California going under is going to lose that money. Because it'll come back. It always does. Right now, it's like an adolescent that just spurted up by a foot and a half. But it'll adjust."

HEADLINE: NATO Patrols Edgy Border, This Time Protecting Serbs 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: ALONG THE KOSOVO-SERBIA BOUNDARY 

 BODY:
This rugged region of snow-covered hillsides and winding paths is NATO's newest front in its campaign to stabilize the Balkans. 
 The adversary this time is not the Serbian military. It is a force of ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting for control of a strip of impoverished Serbian territory next to Kosovo. 
 Specialist Joseph McGugan, 22, tasted the danger directly on Dec. 18 when he was guarding a United States Army demolition team and bursts of gunfire kicked up the dirt by his feet. 
A joint American and Russian patrol had just blown up a road the Albanian insurgents were suspected of using to haul arms and supplies from Kosovo to stoke the rebellion in southern Serbia. The rebels registered their displeasure with a burst of gunfire from their positions on the Serbian side of the Kosovo-Serbia boundary. 
"There were bullets all around my feet, head, arms, limbs, my whole body," Specialist McGugan recalled. 
Specialist McGugan could not see where the fire came from and, wary of hitting civilians, held his fire. But the Russians fired away. As the patrol made a hurried getaway, the Russians cried out that the rebels were preparing to fire a mortar round at the peacekeepers. 
The insurgents were sternly warned not to challenge the peacekeepers again, and the push to control the boundary has continued. American officers say the goal is to deprive the insurgents of the weapons and supplies they need to start a spring offensive. 
British soldiers, operating from camouflaged observation posts and using tactics adopted from their long hunt of Irish Republican Army guerrillas in Northern Ireland, have captured several arms caches and captured bands of guerrillas. 
In one overzealous mission, a British helicopter mistakenly crossed the boundary earlier this month and dropped a four-man team in the middle of the insurgents' training camp. 
Swedish soldiers patrol winding mountain trails on skis while Finnish troops staff checkpoints on the nearby roads in Kosovo. 
American Army Kiowa reconnaissance helicopters prowl the frontier, and American artillery batteries fire illumination rounds to light up the border for American patrols. Indeed, the United States military is now devoting about 25 percent of its Kosovo resources -- soldiers, aircraft and intelligence -- to interdicting the flow of rebel supplies and volunteers.
While sealing the twisting boundary is impossible, the peacekeepers' say their operations are starting to take a toll on the rebels. Sixty suspected rebels, whose numbers range from 500 to 800, according to American intelligence, are now in detention at Camp Bondsteel, the Americans' main base. 
"We have stolen all of their food, taken quite a few of their weapons and been patrolling and detaining individuals," said Lt. Col. Stephen Kilpatrick, the British commander of the First Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, which is responsible for many of the recent captures. "They are really uneasy about our presence." 
It was not supposed to be this way. When the Kosovo war ended in 1999 after a 78-day bombing campaign and a force of international peacekeepers was dispatched to the province, the main worry was to stop ethnic strife in Kosovo and deter Serbian soldiers and police officers from returning. 
Nobody anticipated that one of their most important -- and potentially dangerous -- tasks would be to guard Serbia against an Albanian insurgency, rather than protect Kosovo Albanians from Serbian forces. 
The cease-fire arrangement with the Serbs, however, unintentionally has forced the peacekeepers to worry about just that. 
In NATO's effort to keep Belgrade's forces at a safe distance, a three-mile-wide buffer zone was established on the Serbian side of the Kosovo-Serbian boundary. Only lightly armed Serbian police officers are allowed to operate in the "Ground Safety Zone," as it is called, and the peacekeepers are allowed to enter only under extraordinary conditions.
But the zone is also home to a sizable ethnic Albanian population that has long chafed under Belgrade's rule. Taking advantage of the ban on a Serbian military presence, the Albanians have turned the zone into a hotbed of resistance, founding the grandly named Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac (three of the towns they wish to "free").
Though the liberation group says it is a defensive force, it has attacked Serbian police officers, killing four in November. While the liberation army is a loose confederation of local rebel groups, NATO officials fear that some of the insurgents may be trying to provoke Belgrade into dispatching military forces into the zone to try to quash the rebellion. That would certainly represent a violation of the cease-fire arrangements and damage relations between NATO and the newly elected government of Serbia. 
But it could also destabilize the whole region by prompting ethnic Albanians in Kosovo -- some of whom have already joined the guerrilla force -- and in neighboring Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro to rush to the rebels' aid. 
"There is the potential for a sort of explosion," Carlo Cabigiosu, the Italian lieutenant general who commands the 38,000-strong multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo, said in an interview. "It could be a new, so to say, 'little Kosovo' started in southern Serbia," he added, alluding to the Serb-Albanian clashes that preceded the 1999 Kosovo war. 
General Cabigiosu said the best way to defuse the situation would be political negotiation between the Serbian authorities and the ethnic Albanians to protect their rights in Serbia, ensure they have access to social services and improve the area's economy. 
The peacekeepers have some influence over the insurgents. After the liberation army hijacked a Serbian payroll in mid-January that was intended for Serbian teachers in Kosovo, General Cabigiosu's political adviser coaxed them to return it. Belgrade, for its part, has so far refrained from a heavy-handed crackdown.
In the meantime, however, a force of American, British, Russian and other international peacekeepers are trying to choke the rebellion by cutting off their supplies from Kosovo. 
The boundary mission represents something of a turnabout for the American military. 
After the Kosovo war ended, NATO's then overall military commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, proposed that the Americans be stationed in the northern part of the province, a mission that would thrust them into one potential flashpoint -- the divided town of Mitrovica in the north. But the Pentagon demurred. It insisted that the American sector be in the ostensible safer territory of southeast Kosovo.
So today the Americans control "Multi-National Brigade East," the sector that abuts the 55-mile-long Kosovo-Serbian boundary and which is precisely the region through which the insurgents are now trying to move supplies to their fighters in the adjoining buffer zone. 
Some 5,200 American troops operate in the sector, as do more than 2,300 British, Finnish, Swedish, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian, Italian, Greek, Jordanian and United Arab Emirates troops.
The inadvertent decision to put the United States force on NATO's new front line has enabled the Americans to take advantage of their high-tech weapons and practice combat skills. Hardened British soldiers, brought into the American-controlled sector in eastern Kosovo last month to help tighten the control of the boundary, however, have achieved much of the recent success. 
The British pride themselves on their austere military life and willingness to take more risks than their American counterparts. British soldiers drive to the snow-capped ridges in tracked vehicles and camp out in small pup tents, boiling foil bags of rations for food and hiding their presence by banning the use of flashlights at night. 
Some guard chilly observation posts, where teams of soldiers keep watch for shifts as long as 48 to 72 hours. Others are lifted from their mountain encampment deeper into the wild to conduct patrols and search for telltale trails in the snow. 
The British have also set up ground-based radars that can detect the movement of a rabbit and use mobile quick reaction teams to swoop down on supply columns and insurgents. 
"This is what we do well," said Brig. Robert Fry, the commander of the British forces in Kosovo. "What the Americans do well is provide a guarantee of overwhelming force. This plays to our strength in ways that it does not necessarily play to American strengths." 
Sgt. Cliff Lea scored one of the biggest British successes. After hearing the rumble of a tractor, he scampered from the ruins of a building near the border on Dec. 20, and with the aid of two other soldiers, captured 13 insurgents and three vehicles full of heavy-machine guns, grenades and other arms. 
"It is the most fun I had in 15 years in the army," he said. 
The British soldiers' gung-ho approach has had its comic side. On Jan. 7, a British Puma helicopter was ordered to whisk a four-man team to intercept a band of rebels who appeared to be moving from Serbia into Kosovo. But when the soldiers jumped out, they discovered that they had been deposited on the wrong side of the Kosovo-Serbian boundary and smack inside the rebels' training camp, which the British have nicknamed Fort Benning.
The startled insurgents asked the British if they had come to help them in their fight against the Serbs. Keeping their cool, the British troops asked the rebels to put down their weapons, shook hands with their adversaries and anxiously waited for their helicopter to return.
"It was quite a bracing moment," Brigadier Fry said.
British commanders are concerned that their success might lead the insurgents to send more supplies through the Russian sector to the north. The Russians have captured only one suspected insurgent since November, said Lt. Col. Oleg V. Rekin, the Russian commander. The Russians take a much more static approach to monitoring the boundary, and seem afraid to stir up further enmity from the Albanians, who then tend to view them as allies of the Serbs. 
In an effort to plug the gap, the American forces are stepping up their cooperation with the Russians, including the firing of illumination rounds over the boundary and joint patrols. 
The American troops have also been working with the British. One of the biggest captures of suspected insurgents took place on Jan. 6 when British troops came upon a group of suspected rebels who have ventured into Kosovo to pick up a shipment of arms. 
After encountering the British, the insurgents broke into a mad dash. Rob Smith and Scott Fitzgerald, two American Kiowa reconnaissance helicopter pilots, flew along the boundary, trying to block the Albanians from returning to the boundary zone while the British gave chase. 
After several hours, British soldiers collared nine suspected liberation army members. The Albanians claimed they were looking for a lost cow. But the British punctured that alibi by sending a soldier disguised as a veterinary expert to the farm of one of their detainees, where he found the cow in question present and accounted for. 
That was not the only evidence the British collected. They also confiscated 22 rifles, one with a round in its chamber.

HEADLINE: Pataki Administration to Bolster Spending on Energy Conservation 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The Pataki administration decided today to double the state's spending on electric power conservation, an area where it had made deep cuts in previous years, in an admission that it needs to do something to head off soaring energy costs, or, worse yet, power failures this summer.
 The Public Service Commission, appointed by the governor, voted unanimously to raise the conservation-related charges added to all consumers' electricity bills, from a total of $78 million a year to $150 million. That is still well below the peak of $286 million in 1992, before Gov. George E. Pataki took office. 
 The money helps consumers, business and residential, pay for things like more efficient lighting systems and appliances. The commission also earmarked $14 million a year, about five times as much as the state had been spending, on renewable sources of energy, particularly wind power. New York State's first two commercial "wind farms," both upstate, went into operation in the last year.
Maureen O. Helmer, the commission chairwoman, said after the meeting that the state would also begin an advertising campaign urging people to cut energy consumption, using as much as $3 million from the charges approved today, and a similar amount from another state agency, the Energy Research and Development Authority.
State regulators insist that New York will not see anything quite like the disaster in California, where utilities are threatening bankruptcy and there have been rolling blackouts. They concede, though, that high demand could cause price spikes this summer, like last summer, and that this year could be worse.
Some experts say that New York, like California, could actually find itself unable to meet all the demand for power -- if not this year, then in 2002 or 2003.
Ms. Helmer called it "the most important issue New York is facing." Getting people to use less power, she said, could be a crucial part of surviving the next few years, until new plants are built.
Early in Mr. Pataki's tenure, his administration was focused on lowering energy costs, and it cut conservation spending by more than two-thirds, despite protests from environmental groups. Environmentalists contend that continuing the programs at the level of the early 1990's would have prevented about 500 megawatts of the rise in demand since then -- the equivalent of a medium-sized power plant -- and made the current problems much less severe.
"It's certainly good that the state is going to be finally moving in the other direction and increasing the funding," said Peter M. Iwanowicz, director of environmental health at the American Lung Association of New York State. "But we still lag behind where we were, and behind other states in the region."
Business groups, which want to lower power prices, supported the cutback in the conservation charge -- which adds less than 1 percent to the bill -- and have advocated eliminating it entirely.
Prices jumped last summer at times of peak demand, and Consolidated Edison customers in New York City and Westchester County paid rates that were, for the entire year, 10 to 15 percent above those in 1999. The higher prices resulted in part from rising demand for electricity, and in part from high prices from the oil and natural gas that power plants burn.
Some of the increase -- how much is a subject of considerable debate -- also stemmed from the state's deregulation of the power industry, which has allowed the owners of power plants to encourage price spikes when demand is high. The administration is trying to change some of the rules governing the power market to avoid such problems.
Power companies want to build several new plants in New York, and the Pataki administration wants to allow them, but environmentalists and others have raised objections to some of the proposals. Just two weeks ago, the state approved the construction of 10 emergency generators in New York City with a total capacity of about 400 megawatts to prevent energy shortages this summer.
In the commission's meeting today, Ms. Helmer delivered a harshly worded broadside against those critics, saying, in essence, that having gotten more conservation spending, they should drop their objections to new power plants.
"It's my expectation that the environmental community will not acknowledge publicly what they have long acknowledged privately," she said, "namely, that the new, clean, efficient generation that is being proposed in New York is absolutely vital to the continued health of New York's economy and will benefit the environment by ultimately displacing older, dirtier plants."

HEADLINE: Broad Cuts at Lucent Include 10,000 Jobs 

 BODY:
Lucent Technologies, one of the world's biggest makers of communications equipment, announced a broad reorganization that includes eliminating 10,000 jobs, about 9.4 percent of its workers. Fifteen hundred of those are to be in New Jersey, where the company employs 17,000 people. 
Throughout Lucent, many cuts will come in overlapping sales and marketing groups.
 The plan, which includes a charge of at least $1.2 billion, is meant to help the company climb back to the top of the digital economy after a series of damaging missteps. 
 For a few years after Lucent was spun off from AT&T in 1996, its stock, profits and profile soared as it expanded overseas and began providing gear for the Internet and data networks. But it returned to earth last year, warning four times that it would not meet its financial targets.

HEADLINE: School Board Authorizes Development of Web Site 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The New York City Board of Education yesterday authorized Chancellor Harold O. Levy to solicit bids to build and manage what could be the Internet's largest education site and to supply teachers and every student above the fourth grade with an Internet device or computer for use at school and at home.
 While the move had been expected, education officials disclosed yesterday that not all of the costs of developing the site and deploying the computer hardware were expected to be covered by a separate board-associated commercial site that would generate revenue through advertising and corporate sponsorships. 
 That prediction contrasted sharply with a consultant's report to the board last fall, which predicted that the project's estimated cost of $900 million over 10 years could easily be paid for by advertising and partnership revenues of nearly $4 billion over the same period.
Since that report was issued, however, the Internet industry has suffered severe setbacks, leading to wholesale reassessments at many companies about the economic potential of Internet ventures. The turnabout led one Board of Education member to caution yesterday that some aspects of the technology venture might have to be re-evaluated. 
The Board of Education's technology plan, which the board said "seeks to employ a new paradigm for student use of information technology," is expected to include educational Web pages for use in the classroom and a separate revenue-generating commercial site that would help pay for the entire enterprise.
But board officials sought yesterday to play down that idea. "I don't think it would surprise any of us if it wasn't completely self-funded," David Klasfeld, deputy chancellor for operations, said in response to a question from Terri Thomson, the board representative from Queens.
"It's clear that some significant amount of money could be generated," Mr. Klasfeld said, adding that the chancellor's office had already received more than 100 inquiries from companies or organizations interested in the board's request for proposals to build the technology venture. But, he said, it was possible that the Board of Education would have to bear some of the costs.
Ms. Thomson responded that if the project required significant financing from the board, "We will need to have a discussion about how we would fund this; would this be our priority were we to have extra money?"
Supporters of the project, including Irving S. Hamer Jr., the board's Manhattan representative and the chairman of the task force that came up with the original proposal to build the site and provide computers and Internet access to students, said they remained convinced that the project would pay for itself.
Board officials said a formal request for proposals to build the new site was likely to be issued this week.
The board also heard a report yesterday about the educational advantages that the new Internet site would provide to teachers and students. Previously, at least one board member, Sandra E. Lerner, the Bronx representative, questioned how the Internet project would be incorporated into classrooms and whether it would help promote the attainment of the state's rigorous learning standards.
In an interview after the meeting, Dr. Lerner said she was confident that "we now have a road map of how, for each curriculum area, we can use technology to enhance and expand the educational experience for teachers, students and parents."
Once implemented, the technology venture would allow the board to combine instruction and technology in new ways -- for example, by letting students proceed at their own pace through online lesson plans rather than being captive to the delivery of instruction in a classroom.
Andrew Rasiej, an adviser to the Board of Education's technology committee and the president of Mouse, a nonprofit organization that works to bring technology into the public schools, said that the plan "represents a milestone event in public education in this country."

HEADLINE: Well-Known Skyscraper Sold to Little-Known Family 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A relatively unknown family partnership is buying one of the biggest real estate trophies in Manhattan: Citigroup Center, the slant-roofed, 59-story tower that cuts a distinctive silhouette on the Midtown skyline.
 Eric D. Hadar and his father, Richard, bid $725 million for the silver tower at Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street, pre-empting other prospective buyers at the very moment many real estate executives were holding their breath, worried that the economy would slow, ending a spectacular real estate boom. 
 But if the deal is completed, the Hadars are hoping that the purchase of the 1.65-million-square-foot building will catapult them from obscurity to the top ranks of New York's real estate families.
The Hadars are expected to sign a contract to buy the office tower this morning from Dai-ichi Life Investment Properties, a Japanese insurance company that has owned a major stake in the building since 1987, said Thomas R. McClayton, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle, an adviser to Dai-ichi. 
"They're going from being a nobody to a big somebody," said Peter Riguardi, vice chairman of Colliers ABR, a real estate company. "There are only so many buildings that have a world-class identity and that building is certainly one of them."
Eric D. Hadar, 36, formed his real estate company, Allied Partners, in 1993, when he bought a two-story building in the East Village. His father, a partner in the firm, had owned the country's largest direct- marketing company selling jewelry until 1986, when he sold it for $100 million. In recent years, they have made some short-term real estate loans and bought a string of 24 properties, including the Studio 54 building at 254 West 54th Street, 1 East 57th Street and 285 Lafayette Street in Manhattan.
The Hadars also own a one-third stake in Brown Harris Stevens, which is buying Halstead Property Company, making it the second largest residential real estate broker in the city.
Although the Hadar family has valued its portfolio at more than $500 million, none of it compares with Citigroup Center, which George Twill, president of CSFB Realty, called a "marquee building." And the Hadars say they are intent on establishing a family-owned real estate empire like the Resnicks, the Roses, the Dursts and the Rudins.
"For me and Dad, this is a multigenerational asset," Eric Hadar said in an interview on Monday. "If you look back at the legendary New York real estate families, they've always built their empires by agreeing to pay up. A building like this almost never comes on the market."
The deal for the tower comes amid a general uneasiness in the New York real estate market, with some prospective bidders for Citigroup Center suggesting that the Hadars paid too much. With the turmoil in the stock market and a slowing economy, many real estate executives are concerned that rents and property values may suddenly drop, after reaching record levels over the last four years.
"There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty at the moment," said John D. Lyons, executive managing director of Granite Partners, a real estate investment bank. "But there's lots of capital available for deals. Historically, real estate has been a hedge against inflation."
So far at least, office rents have not fallen, just slowed their relentless march upward. According to Cushman & Wakefield, the average rent for prime space in Midtown jumped $17, to $66.68 in the first nine months of 2000, but ended the year with a modest bump to $67.11.
Mr. Riguardi of Colliers ABR said there was still very little vacant space and new buildings under construction already had tenants, although he expected rents to fall by as much as one-third on the far West Side of Manhattan and in other once-industrial areas that had become fashionable for now struggling e-commerce and technology companies.
The Hadars' deal for Citigroup Center reflects a shift in the kind of buyers prowling the New York real estate market. In recent years, opportunity funds and real estate trusts that required huge profits bought most of the skyscrapers that were put on the auction block. Now the tide is turning in favor of wealthy families and pension funds willing to accept smaller returns as the property appreciates over a long period of time.
The Crown family of Chicago and Tishman Speyer Properties, for instance, recently bought Rockefeller Center when Goldman Sachs's Whitehall fund put the landmark complex up for sale. And now the Hadars are buying Citigroup Center.
"This market has always been about prominent families investing in real estate to build their wealth," said Darcy Stacom of Cushman & Wakefield. "The 1990's were an aberration."
In any event, the sale of Citigroup Center is akin to three-dimensional chess. The building, built in 1978, was a looming monolith cantilevered over St. Peter's Lutheran Church. In an effort to raise cash a decade later, Citicorp sold Dai-Ichi a two-thirds interest in Citicorp Center and a one-third interest in the bank's former headquarters at 399 Park Avenue for $670 million.
Dai-ichi took the first step toward selling the property in November, when it agreed to a swap with what is now called Citigroup, a financial services company. Dai-ichi signed a contract to buy the bank's remaining stake in the tower, while the financial company agreed to acquire Dai-Ichi's interest in the 39-story, 1.6-million-square-foot tower at 399 Park, which will become the world headquarters for Citigroup.
Eric Hadar said that he moved quickly in mid-December when he heard that Citigroup Center was about to go on the auction block. He notified Dai-ichi that he wanted to make a pre-emptive offer for the building, before the Japanese company accepted any bids.
Real estate executives involved in the auction said that Jerry I. Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, Abycq Rosen of RFR Holdings, Mortimer B. Zuckerman of Boston Properties and Steven Roth of Vornado Realty Trust all expressed interest in buying the tower, but were somewhat squeamish about paying $750 million, the expected minimum price. Meanwhile, the Hadars quickly made their offer and lined up financing with Deutsche Bank.
"We were prepared to sign a contract with no outs and a huge deposit, close to $40 million," Eric Hadar said.

HEADLINE: Program Begun for Minorities 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson and executives from AOL Time Warner started a program yesterday intended to increase opportunities for minority business owners by bringing them together with investors. 
 The project, called i-DealFlow, involved several companies and organizations, including AOL Time Warner, Coca-Cola, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Telecommunications Development Fund and Mr. Jackson's Rainbow Coalition-Wall Street Project. 
 Robert W. Pittman, AOL Time Warner's co-chief operating officer, said: "The venture capitalists say they never see great minority-owned businesses, and the companies say they can't get their ideas heard. If you bring minority businesses and investors together, they'll make a deal."
A training program for minority entrepreneurs to hone business plans was scheduled for Sept. 19 to Sept. 22 in Atlanta. 
A venture capital fair, where businesses will be able to meet with investors, was scheduled for Nov. 2 in Atlanta.
Asked whether signs of an economic slowdown make this a bad time to start the project, Mr. Jackson said, "Underserved Americans, with underutilized talent, represent the key to stopping a recession, because that would be our growth market."

Large Companies Prevail In U.S. Auction of Airwaves
Taking advantage of rules intended to help the smallest telecommunications companies and bolster competition, the nation's largest wireless phone services and their partners are on the verge of winning scores of new licenses in a $17 billion auction of airwaves.
 The small companies that were supposed to have received special treatment to promote competition are complaining that they lost at the expense of giants like AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS, VoiceStream and Cingular. Verizon Wireless, which refused to form a partnership with a small company, appears likely to pay the highest price. Page A1. 

Another European auction of high-speed wireless phone licenses appeared on the verge of collapse after two of four candidates withdrew in France. World Business, Section W.

Genetic Food Industry in Disarray
The genetically modified food industry is in a crisis of its own making. Worldwide protest has been galvanized, Europeans have banned the products and some American food producers are backing away. What is particularly surprising is how an industry that has been so successful in controlling its own regulations ended up in such disarray. A1.

Oil Companies Post Solid Profits
Exxon Mobil, Texaco and Chevron reported significantly higher profits, buoyed by the steep prices for natural gas and oil. Net income more than doubled at Exxon Mobil, rose 71 percent at Texaco and nearly doubled at Chevron. All three companies surpassed expectations. Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 19 cents, to $81.63, while Texaco rose 38 cents, to $59.13, and Chevron rose 31 cents, to $79.88. C2.

California Receives Power Offers
California received a host of nervously awaited, long-term offers from electricity generators to sell power to the state in what many described as a critical, multibillion-dollar step in resolving the simmering energy crisis. A1.

California is long used to fires, floods, earthquakes and riots. But no problem in a century and a half of statehood can quite compare to the electricity crisis gripping the state. A1.

Stocks Mixed in Lackluster Session
Investors refrained from making any big commitments in the stock market, leaving stocks little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.84 points, to 10,646.97. The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.76 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,859.15, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 3.90 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,364.30. C10.

Talks End on Financing for Finova
Finova, a finance company based in Arizona, said that negotiations on a financing package of up to $350 million announced last November with Leucadia National had ended after the company was unable to persuade lenders to accept a discount on their debt. C7.

Icahn Willing to Aid T.W.A. Effort
The investor Carl C. Icahn is willing to help finance an alternative plan that would enable Trans World Airlines to remain independent instead of being taken over, according to court papers. Mr. Icahn, who owned T.W.A. in the 1980's, joined Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines in objecting to the proposal by AMR, the parent of American Airlines, to take over most of T.W.A.'s assets for $500 million in cash and $3 billion in assumed debt.

HEADLINE: Big Companies Prove Winners In Airwave Bids 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Taking advantage of rules intended to help the smallest telecommunications companies and bolster competition, the nation's largest wireless phone services and their partners are on the verge of winning scores of new licenses in an auction of airwaves that will enable them to expand service and move into new territories.
 As the Federal Communications Commission prepares to close its $17 billion auction -- the largest ever held by the government -- the small companies that were supposed to have received special treatment to promote competition are complaining that they lost at the expense of giants like AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS, VoiceStream and Cingular, the joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth. 
 Those companies have struck agreements with smaller partners that will enable them to win more than 160 licenses at a sharp discount, and by one rival's estimate cost taxpayers as much as $626 million.
Verizon Wireless, the one national wireless company that refused to form a partnership with a small company, appears likely to pay the highest price. It has surprised analysts who expected the industry to be more circumspect after the fallout from the frenzied bidding at two European auctions last year. 
Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone, has filed nearly $9 billion in high bids in 113 markets, including two licenses in New York City for a total of more than $4 billion. 
The bidding has reached about $17 billion, more for the Treasury than all of the combined previous auctions of the F.C.C. In recent days, the bidding has slowed to a trickle, and because the auction ends when no new bids are submitted, officials predicted today that it would end soon.
Although it was supposed to help smaller companies get many of the 422 licenses in 195 markets nationwide, more than 95 percent of the high bids have come from the largest companies and their partners, like Dobson Communications, Salmon PCS, Cook Inlet, and Alaska Native Wireless, which, with the stronger financial backing, have been able to bid on the licenses reserved for the small players. 
In each market, the auction rules set aside either one or two licenses for companies with assets of less than $500 million and gross revenue of less than $125 million in each of the last two years. And if those companies decide to bid for the licenses open to all companies, they receive a 25 percent credit.
F.C.C. officials say the rules are supposed to prevent smaller companies from being used as shams. But the rules are also not supposed to discourage larger companies from making investments in the smaller companies because telecommunications is so capital intensive.
For the small companies that have lost, there is no doubt that their bigger rivals violated the rules.
"We believe we've been topped by sham entrepreneurs," said John Rogovin, a Washington lawyer representing Allegheny Communications Inc., a small Texas company that pulled out of its bid to win a license in San Antonio after higher bids were filed by small companies in which AT&T Wireless and VoiceStream have large financial interests. The losing bidders are expected to challenge the winning alliances.
Officials at the F.C.C. said today that they would examine the structure of the companies to assure that they complied with the rules and were not actually controlled by AT&T, Sprint, VoiceStream or Cingular.
The challenges will also represent a test of the views of Michael K. Powell, the new F.C.C. chairman, who since his appointment on Monday has declined requests from reporters to discuss any issues or his agenda.
Executives at AT&T Wireless, Cingular, Sprint, VoiceStream and their smaller partners either declined to comment or said that they were confident that the small companies complied with the auction rules.
The major wireless carriers have been eager to expand their coverage nationwide and increase their capacity in crowded urban markets, where cell phone customers experience the frustrations of interrupted calls and busy signals because of the overcrowded airwaves. 
As it now stands, Verizon will win the most licenses, but at a heavy cost. Its two licenses in New York City, for example, will cost a total of more than $4 billion. The high bid for a third license in New York, almost $1.5 billion, has been submitted by Alaska Native Wireless, one of those small companies that have been criticized because its rivals view it as a front for AT&T.
Compared with other wireless spectrum auctions abroad, the price paid by Verizon has struck analysts as unusually high. On a per-customer basis, the New York licenses will cost Verizon almost three times the average paid by European companies in auctions last year in Germany and Britain. 
Analysts and executives said the winners in those auctions had wildly overpaid. After those auctions, the planned wireless auction in Switzerland collapsed after several participants pulled out, and Italy's auction attracted far less than expected because British Telecommunications withdrew. In France, two of four bidders withdrew today. Page W1. 
"If you look at just the price paid by Verizon, it does look like it's crazy and they overpaid," said Eric Kintz, an associate partner in charge of the e-commerce and telecommunications practice at Roland Berger, a management consulting firm. "But if you look at the long-term strategic value of having a lot of spectrum in New York, that's a different thing. If they have the money to do it, it may be the right move as a longer-term investment."
Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for Verizon's wireless unit, said that neither he nor other executives of the company could comment on the auction while it was proceeding because the company's lawyers say that rules that prohibit collusive communications between competing bidders prevent any discussion of the auction while it is under way.
Federal officials say that they are unconcerned about Verizon's high bids and that there is no correlation between expensive licenses and increases in consumer rates. They note that wireless phone service was more expensive when the licenses were issued free and that prices are more closely related to competition than to the costs of the airwaves.
"Clearly by any measure relative to past auctions, the prices are high, but whether the winners overpaid is another question," said Hal J. Singer, an economist who has advised companies in the current auction, as well as in auctions in Australia and Germany. "Verizon did this legitimately and they are now probably kicking themselves," Mr. Singer said. "They will come out looking smart if AT&T and Cingular get disqualified for winning through shams."
Mr. Singer, who is working with Allegheny Communications, estimated that the small companies allied with the major carriers, by virtue of the 25 percent small-business credit, will cost taxpayers $626 million that the Treasury would otherwise have without that credit.

HEADLINE: Davos Forum Is Braced For Round of Protests 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The World Economic Forum, the annual gathering of heads of state, senior political figures and business leaders, is opening on Thursday in Davos, the secluded ski resort in eastern Switzerland. And the threat of disruptions hangs in the Alpine air, as antiglobalization protesters promise to take their competing world vision to the streets.
 In contrast to last year, when President Clinton spoke, no senior figures in the Bush administration are to attend the forum, though the advance roster includes the secretary of state of Florida, Katherine Harris, fresh from appearing before a federal commission reviewing her stewardship of the state's election process, as well as Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and other governors. 
 In all, about 3,200 guests are expected for the 315 speeches, round tables and seminars exploring this year's themes of sustaining world economic growth and bridging divisions between haves and have-nots.
Five minutes away at a clinic for asthma patients, a counterconference, Public Eye on Davos, is also set. It has been convened by a coalition of nongovernment organizations, including Friends of the Earth, and is to involve some of the participants attending the forum.
And a large number of antiglobalization protesters are expected to converge on Davos, too, despite its remote location. Local courts have rebuffed efforts to forbid protests entirely, so the police are bracing for an onslaught and planning to deploy 600 officers from all parts of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
Anti-WTO Coordination, a group based in Bern that is planning a demonstration on Saturday, has rejected the idea of dialogue or cooperation with the forum, even after last year's clashes on the streets of Davos in which shops and vehicles were damaged. "The violence comes from the W.E.F. and its guests and their dangerous policies, such as sweatshops in Mexico and building dams," said Simone Brunner, a spokesman for the group. "We don't want to improve them; we want to stop them."
Organizers of the forum dismissed the threats. "It's like bees to honey," said the forum's managing director, Claude Smadja. "Every high-profile international event attracts activists and professional troublemakers of all kinds."
Nonetheless, the organizers are treading cautiously.
The forum underwent a shake-up last year, reorganizing to try to translate talk into action through initiatives like a council on corporate governance in Russia, start-up aid for a Balkan customs union and youth job programs in the Middle East, all of which will be discussed this year.
To its critics, these claims for an expanded role -- made, they say, by nonelected, unaccountable people operating behind closed doors -- are troublesome, particularly because the forum has been controlled almost completely for three decades by one man, Klaus Schwab, a Swiss business professor. "The forum is trying to privatize decision-making processes to allow business interests to affect public priorities," said Jolanda Piniel, a spokeswoman for Public Eye on Davos.
Responding to such criticism, the forum has this year invited delegates from unions and an array of nongovernment organizations. But Davos enthusiasts say the criticisms miss the point of the forum. Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of the United Nations program on AIDS, said the forum had helped his program "identify and begin working with potential partners from the corporate sector" at a time when corporations were slow to grapple with H.I.V.
The forum will also seek to expand its audience this year by offering live Internet broadcasts of selected sessions and news conferences, along with edited session transcripts and other materials on its Web site, www.weforum.org. The counterconference's site is www.davos2001.ch.

HEADLINE: Caution Cools Old Feeding Frenzy at Sundance 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The British film director Michael Apted sat in a coffee shop on Main Street here, trying desperately to get a cup of tea, while across the street at the Egyptian Theater his latest film, "Enigma," was in the middle of its second Sundance Film Festival screening. 
 "Everything seems to be going well," he said. "Now the feeding frenzy begins. We hope." 
 Mirroring the changes in the American independent film movement that it helped create, Sundance is a film festival in transition. The jampacked parties with sadistic doormen are still here, and the hot-air buzz and the leather-clad celebrities, but rarer these days are the ragged, unsophisticated filmmakers rolling in from the hinterlands with a fresh, raw vision to unleash. Now everyone is wise. Cool savvy rules the day. 
The bidding wars over film rights that once turned untested directors and unknown actors into overnight sensations also appear to have faded from the scene.
"I feel pretty pleased," said Geoffrey Gilmore, the festival's programming director. "It feels as though everything is running very smooth this year and the films are generally being responded to very well. Yes, there is a cautiousness on the part of buyers. But I understand there are something like eight films in some stage of negotiations, so I expect the acquisitions will pick up before the festival is over."
The films being shown are also changing. Now there are films with extensive special effects, smooth production values, complex animation and, increasingly, major stars. Mr. Apted's "Enigma," a $20 million World War II thriller set in the world of Nazi code-breaking, has a Tom Stoppard script that is based on Robert Harris's best-selling novel and a cast that includes Kate Winslet, Dougray Scott and Saffron Burrows. This is a Sundance film?
"If you define independent film as a film that was produced outside the studio system, then yes, this is an independent film," Mr. Apted said, tea finally in hand. "I recognize that with a $20 million budget, big stars and some special effects, it's not your typical Sundance film. But they asked us to be here and we're delighted."
Mr. Gilmore said he expected to be criticized for including such a movie but that he believed it indicated one way that independent film has been changing in recent years.
Robert Redford, who founded the Sundance Institute 20 years ago, was not able to attend this year's festival because he was in Morocco and England shooting a film. Being absent was difficult, he said in a telephone interview from London today, but he planned to be back in Utah for the institute's annual festival post-mortem in a few weeks, where decisions are made about where independent film is heading and how Sundance must adapt to match it. "Things are changing," Mr. Redford said. "What with digital filmmaking and the Internet and the economy going this way and that way and the globalization, it's all having a real effect on independent filmmaking. Our commitment is to continually adjust, to try to make sure we recapture our original vision. Sometimes the attention focuses too much on the fashion or the celebrities or the acquisitions, but what we are concerned about it providing a forum for the best independent work that's out there." Mr. Apted's film was financed, in large part, by Intermedia, the German film company, and Jagged Films, owned by Mick Jagger. But, like most of the films at Sundance, it has no distributor, which was why Mr. Apted was hoping for a feeding frenzy.
One quality that distinguished past Sundance festivals, particularly ones in the late 1990's, was the intense competition among specialized-film distributors trying to lock up the hot films, often paying millions of dollars for the privilege. But the specialized-film business has been going through a painful transition of its own, with more films competing for the same number of art-house screens and fewer breakout smashes like "The Blair Witch Project" in 1999 or the current "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Many, many more films have simply opened, failed to find an audience and disappeared in the blink of an eye, including some that were bought for a great deal of money at Sundance and other festivals.
"Last year was a key year for the festival," said Ted Hope, a founder of Good Machine, a film production and distribution company based in New York. "It was the first year that there were no major bidding wars for any film."
It is, he said, a matter of economics: If an independent film makes $5 million at the box office, it is now considered a success, and those that make above $10 million are fewer and farther between. 
"You buy the movie, and then you have to spend another $5 million to get it released," Mr. Hope said. "So add up the numbers. Why is anybody going to come up with more than a couple hundred thousand dollars to buy a movie here?"
A few hundred thousand dollars is pocket change compared with the millions that many Sundance films drew a few years ago.
"People are being cautious before they bid on a movie, but they are also facing up to the marketplace realities," said Mark Ordesky, president of Fine Line Pictures. Last year Fine Line paid the festival's highest acquisition price, an estimated $4 million to $5 million for the British comedy "Saving Grace," but this year it has yet to bid on anything. 
"Look at Sundance history," Mr. Ordesky said. "The number of films that have gone north of $10 million is a very short list, but the number of films for which millions were paid but which made nowhere near their purchase price, that's a very long list."
Indeed, the acquisitions market has been quite sleepy at the festival. As of midday today, only two films had been acquired for distribution, a comedy about inept highway patrolmen called "Super Troopers," purchased by Fox Searchlight, and a police comedy from the director Tom DiCillo called "Double Whammy," bought by Lions Gate. But people involved in negotiations said that Miramax Films was closing a deal today to acquire rights to Todd Field's "In the Bedroom," a drama starring Sissy Spacek about how a family weathers a murder.
Other films were expected to be picked up by week's end, but the pace is far behind that of last year's festival, when more than a half-dozen films had been acquired by the end of the opening weekend.
Among the films said to be arousing interest among distributors this year were David Siegel and Scott McGehee's "Deep End," a high-school football documentary called "Go, Tigers!," and an unflinching portrait of a young white supremacist called "The Believer," which was drawing particular notice for its central performance by a newcomer, Ryan Gosling.
But there seems little chance of a bidding war resulting in a $10 million acquisition.
What this means for more expensive projects like "Enigma" remains to be seen as Sundance changes and perhaps settles into middle age. Many here said they expected the festival to attract more midrange films like "Enigma" -- ones with budgets somewhere between the typical independent film, costing about $1 million to $5 million, and the studio blockbuster, at around $100 million.
"Our people there have been saying that not only is it a slow acquisitions market, but it feels slow there this year, just walking around on Main Street," said Amir Malin, chairman of Artisan Entertainment. "I think a lot of people who had gone back to Los Angeles for the Golden Globes on Sunday decided not to return to Utah, and a bunch of other people just opted to get out early seeing that there was a dearth of product this year that was commercially viable. There's no question that, from an activity viewpoint, there's a lot less of it than I can ever remember at a Sundance Film Festival."

HEADLINE: 'Nation Building'? Yes. 

BYLINE:  By Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware is the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Having just returned from Kosovo, Serbia and Bosnia, I am convinced that President Bush must change his position on America's role in the Balkans. During the campaign, the Bush team asserted that extended peacekeeping in the region is Europe's responsibility, not ours, and that long-term "nation building" missions only degrade our troops' combat readiness over time.
 My extensive experience in the region supports the view that precisely because the Balkans are central to Europe's security, they are central to our security -- and thus require our active engagement. Indeed, the development of democracy in the Balkans and continued American leadership of NATO depend on an American military presence in Bosnia and Kosovo that lasts until the missions are successfully completed. 
 Participation in these missions is seen in the Balkans as a litmus test of our commitment to stability and democracy in the region. What's more, Western Europe cannot move toward union and economic growth if Southeastern Europe languishes in poverty and ethnic hostilities. The massive refugee movements in the Balkans during the 1990's are only a prelude to what will happen unless the zone of democratic stability in Europe is extended eastward and southeastward.
It is true that progress toward stable democracies and free-market economies will be uneven in the Balkans, with their fresh legacy of war, violence and economic catastrophe.
But already in Kosovo and Bosnia, a new generation of leaders is emerging. And last fall, the Serbian people rid themselves of Slobodan Milosevic. Their new leaders, President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia and Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic of Serbia, appear to reject aggressive, xenophobic nationalism. My hope is that they will begin to educate Serbs about the crimes against humanity perpetrated in their name -- an effort that includes cooperating fully with The Hague's war crimes tribunal.
Meanwhile, Croatians have moved away from the authoritarianism of the late President Franjo Tudjman, with the new government in Zagreb cooperating with the war crimes tribunal. And Slovenia has fulfilled NATO's requirements for membership. That Balkan success story should be rewarded -- by our support for Slovenia's admission to NATO.
To be sure, we must make clear that our security umbrella and economic assistance will continue only if the Balkan nations pick up the pace of governmental reforms and only if Bosnia breaks free from the stranglehold of its three nationalist parties.
Does this mean that we are intervening in the Balkans in part to aid "nation building"? Yes. The fact is, nation building, if done well, can prevent vastly more expensive full-scale military actions.
Currently, America spends just 1 percent of its defense budget on its peacekeeping troops in Kosovo and Bosnia. Our European allies provide approximately four-fifths of these peacekeeping forces. But with our less than one-fifth contribution, we retain overall command of these forces.
As for the issue of weakening our troops' war readiness, American commanders in Bosnia and Kosovo vigorously reject the notion that their missions degrade our troops' ability to handle other conflicts. They say the experience helps develop skills that enhance the soldiers' abilities in high-intensity conflicts. 
Dealing with Balkan conflicts has always been difficult. But America cannot afford to shy away from this challenge.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The roots of stable expansion extend well beyond the Greenspan era.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason Magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." E-mail: vpostrel@reason.com

 BODY:
AS Alan Greenspan testifies in Congress today, nervous investors and business executives will be looking for any hint of future Federal Reserve policy. From populist talk show hosts to Wall Street traders, many Americans believe Mr. Greenspan, as chairman of the Fed, almost single-handedly controls the economy of the United States.
 He is the "maestro," as the title of a recent book by Bob Woodward puts it. 
 Suppose, then, that the behavior of the economy changed in a way central bankers have long sought. Wouldn't it be natural to credit Fed policy?
That change has indeed occurred. Economic output doesn't bounce around as much as it used to. Instead of booming for a quarter or two and then crashing the next, overall growth rates are much steadier. During the prolonged boom of the 1990's, the economy was much less volatile than in earlier expansions.
This calmer economic ride didn't start in the last decade, however, or with Mr. Greenspan's appointment to the Fed in 1987. It goes all the way back to the first quarter of 1984. That's the moment Margaret M. McConnell, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Gabriel Perez Quiros, an economist for the European Central Bank, call "the break" in the volatility of economic activity. They pinpointed that date using advanced statistical techniques, publishing their results in an article in the December issue of The American Economic Review. (A nontechnical article is at www.ny.frb.org/rmaghome/curr_iss /ci5-13.html.)
Nailing down the exact turning point may require high-powered math, but anyone eyeballing a graph of changes in the growth rate of the nation's gross domestic product can see the general pattern. Swings that used to look wild and scary -- like the electrocardiogram of someone in serious heart trouble (and they did cause heart palpitations in many a business executive) -- settled down in the mid-1980's.
For this column, the researchers updated their work to include data through the third quarter of 2000, the most recent available.
Despite the bumps in the economy lately, the results were the same. "It's true that G.D.P. growth has varied a bit more than usual in recent quarters," they noted in an e-mail message. But "it is still nothing like the kind of fluctuations that used to occur prior to 1984 on a regular basis."
"Back then, swings like we've seen recently occurred practically every year."
Does good Fed policy deserve credit for this unprecedented stability?
It's an important question, since what the Fed gives, the Fed can take away, either through mistakes or changes in inflation-fighting goals.
Public policy is transitory, private-sector progress less so. And we can thank "progress" rather than "policy" for this particular good news, argue James Kahn of the New York Fed along with Dr. McConnell and Dr. Perez Quiros in a paper presented at the recent meetings of the American Economic Association in New Orleans.
The researchers don't deny that good policy is important. (They do, after all, work for central banks.) But their work demonstrates that private-sector changes in organization and technology "may be as important, or even more important, than policy," Dr. Kahn says.
Monetary policy affects the whole economy, including investment and consumption. If Fed decisions had reduced the economy's volatility, every sector would be affected, and the change would definitely show up in sales fluctuations.
That's not what the data show. Instead, a single sector -- durable goods -- accounts for most of the change. And production levels have stabilized much more than sales, which have just moderated a little bit.
Durable goods bought by consumers and business -- automobiles, furniture, aluminum, industrial machinery and the like -- make up less than one-fifth of economic output. But historically their production was so wildly volatile that it had a disproportionate effect on the fluctuations of total national income.
That changed in the 1980's. Under pressure from foreign, particularly Japanese, competition, durable-goods makers changed their business practices. They adopted techniques of lean manufacturing and just-in-time logistics. They used information technology to get real-time data on sales and to restock customers more precisely.
While the news media lavished attention on the new economy, old-line industries dramatically remade themselves. "We're talking about even traditional manufacturers using better machines, being more flexible," Dr. McConnell says. "We're talking about retailers sharing information with their suppliers, so they can order more stock just in time."
These changes didn't just help American companies keep up with their foreign competitors. They made the overall economy more resilient. Shocks, like higher oil prices, may be just as great as they ever were, but they aren't magnified as much. Producers have more accurate and up-to-the-minute information about what's selling, and their plants are able to shift their product mix more quickly. As a result, they don't build up as much inventory of stuff no one wants.
Before, plants tended to keep cranking out durable goods even after demand slowed. As sales dropped, inventories became bigger and bigger. When manufacturers finally realized what was happening, they had to cut production sharply, not only to match lower sales but to eliminate their inventory overhang. That amplified economic woes.
"That's how you lose more jobs," Dr. McConnell says. "That's how you make an economic downturn more severe."
Now, durable-goods makers don't build up those giant inventories as much. So they don't have to make such traumatic adjustments, which used to include mass layoffs, to compensate for even a mild recession.
The researchers decline to speculate on the implications of their work for public policy. But one possible conclusion is that a less volatile economy may require quicker, finer adjustments from the Fed. The plunges of the past may be gone, but that doesn't mean recessions have disappeared.
"What may have been considered a moderate fluctuation in activity prior to the break may now be viewed as severe," the researchers write in the American Economic Review article. Instead of waiting for a major downturn in output, then, the Fed might want to cut interest rates when growth starts to slow just a little bit, lest that slowdown mark the beginning of a steady progression downward.
Regardless of the policy implications, the researchers agree that the economy has improved in a fundamental way. "This is a real-economy phenomenon," Dr. McConnell said. It represents genuine progress, driven by competitive pressure and innovative response, not transient policy or irrational exuberance. "We think it is a permanent feature of the economy," she said. "This isn't just good luck."

HEADLINE: Gore Will Teach at 3 Universities 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
Former Vice President Al Gore said in an interview yesterday that he planned to teach at three universities -- Middle Tennessee State, Fisk and Columbia -- and to write a book about families with his wife, Tipper, while also keeping his political options open.
 In his first extensive public remarks about his future, Mr. Gore said he had made no decisions about whether to run again for president or any other elective office. 
 "I'm not considering anything political right now, but I haven't ruled out thinking about such things later on," said Mr. Gore, who won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote in last year's campaign against George W. Bush. "The only decision I've made about politics is not to make a decision until I've had more time for reflection and rest." 
Mr. Gore said he had no plans at the moment to set up a political action committee, though several Democratic officials and former Gore aides said they expected him to do so at some point.
Speaking by telephone from his home in Arlington, Va., which he reoccupied last week, Mr. Gore said that his first teaching assignment would come on Feb. 6, when he lectures at the Columbia University school of journalism about the relationship between the news media and public policy.
He also said he planned to lecture on the emerging discipline of "community building" at both Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, and Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, about 30 miles south of Nashville. 
Mr. Gore, who maintains a house in Carthage, Tenn., not far from Nashville, said in his concession speech last month that he would work to mend fences in his home state, which he lost to Mr. Bush.
He will teach the course at Fisk along with Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who was graduated from that university. 
"I've always wanted to try teaching and I'm particularly excited about teaching these courses on community building because it's something new and to me it's very exciting," he said.
Community building, Mr. Gore explained, is an interdisciplinary approach that grew out of discussions at annual conferences on family issues that the Gores sponsored in Tennessee over the last nine years. It seeks to bring together authorities from fields like education, business, architecture, law and public policy to teach "all of the skills that are relevant to bringing a community to life," he said.
When asked what precisely such a discipline would teach, Mr. Gore paused, chuckled and then referred the question to Dr. Neil Halfon, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who directs a small consortium of universities exploring the field. "I am going to be immersing myself in it in preparation for these teaching assignments," Mr. Gore said.
Dr. Halfon said that community building differed from development models that focused purely on economics, business and design. "These economic or business strategies are important," he said, "but what is also important is the family-focused, human capital approach."
The presidents of both Fisk and Middle Tennessee State said they were thrilled to be adding Mr. Gore to their faculties. R. Eugene Smith, the president of Middle Tennessee State, noted that Mr. Gore's father, Senator Albert Gore Sr., was a graduate and that his papers were housed at the university. John L. Smith, the president of Fisk, said Mr. Gore would "bring valuable insight and a terrific intellect."
Mr. Gore and Mr. Lewis may also deliver lectures at other colleges in Tennessee and at other historically black colleges. "He's very up and he's excited about meeting with young people and helping to shape and educate another generation," Mr. Lewis said of his new partner.
Mr. Gore, who is expected to receive a federal pension approaching $100,000 annually, said he and his wife also planned to deliver speeches, some for pay and some without charge.
The Gores' book is scheduled to be published in the fall of 2002 by Henry Holt & Company. "Tipper and I have in many ways been preparing for this for over nine years now," Mr. Gore said, referring to their conferences on the family. "We've both made a strong personal and professional commitment to supporting and strengthening the family at a time of tremendous cultural and economic upheaval." He said the book would blend personal anecdotes with a discussion of history, psychology and policy.
"It's going to be about the family as an institution, as an emotional venue, as a process," he said. "It will examine the challenges that families face in areas like health care and education, entertainment, care of the elderly, preschool." 
Mr. Gore has offered little public analysis of either his campaign or of the emotional toll that the protracted court battle over the vote in Florida might have taken on him and his family. The 20-minute interview was no exception. When asked what the last five weeks had been like, he feigned puzzlement. "The last five weeks?" he asked. "What's your starting date for that?"
He then provided an itinerary of his last five weeks: "I got a late start on Christmas shopping, we took a few days off at a beach, we went home to Tennessee for Christmas, and came back and started organizing for the transition, and went skiing for a few days in Colorado, and then I've been working on setting up the arrangements that made it possible to accept these invitations from M.T.S.U. and Fisk and Columbia."
Pressed again to discuss how he had dealt emotionally with the way the election ended, Mr. Gore said: "I feel fine. After the 36-day period, nothing fazed me in the aftermath. I'm just looking toward to the future and I'm very grateful for the opportunities I've had to serve my country, and Tipper and I are looking for ways to continue serving and promoting the cause of families, strong families and strong communities. And I got to go."
Then, before a follow-up question could be asked, he got off the line.

HEADLINE: Suggesting Smaller Cuts, Democrats Say Republican Tax Plan Is Too Risky 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Faced with a concerted push by President Bush and the Republican majority in Congress for a big tax cut, Democrats say that Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion plan is too expensive, even at a time of growing federal budget surpluses, and could harm the economy more than help it.
 In what amounted to an opening bid in the negotiations to come, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate, told reporters today that he would be comfortable supporting a tax reduction in the range of $850 billion over the next decade. 
 But Mr. Daschle said he did not want Congress to begin work on a tax bill until it had settled on a budget that provided not just for tax cuts but also for other needs, like increases in military spending and prescription drug coverage for retirees.
The Congressional Budget Office is scheduled to release an updated projection of the surplus next week. Members of both parties said they had been told that the surplus would total about $5.6 trillion over 10 years starting in 2002.
Of that amount, about $2.5 trillion would come from excess Social Security revenue, which both parties agree should be off limits for tax cuts or additional spending.
Republicans said that the more than $3 trillion remaining would be more than enough to allow a tax reduction of the scale proposed by Mr. Bush, or perhaps even more.
Mr. Bush's plan would reduce all income tax rates, double the child credit, provide a break to married couples with two incomes and repeal the federal estate tax. The president defended his plan in a meeting with Congressional leaders today.
Speaking to the United States Chamber of Commerce, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, said he would like to see the package include a reduction in the capital gains tax and a provision to scale back the alternative minimum tax, a complex formula that is increasingly requiring middle- and upper-income taxpayers to pay more taxes.
Mr. Lott said he would also like to add more provisions to help businesses.
Democrats said any serious effort by Republicans to expand the tax cut would doom efforts to reach a consensus.
"That's just irresponsible," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. He said too big a tax cut would risk putting the government back into deficit.
Democrats said the new projections would show a non-Social Security surplus of about $3.1 trillion over the 10 years. About $500 billion of that amount would come from excess Medicare revenue, which, like the Social Security surplus, should not be used for tax cuts or spending, Democrats said.
That would leave $2.6 trillion available for tax cuts and all other initiatives. Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion tax reduction would actually eat up around $2 trillion, Democrats said, because using the surplus for tax reductions would increase the interest the government must pay on its debt.
The remaining $600 billion would probably be too little to pay for the other initiatives that the two parties are considering, Democrats said, especially if the surplus projections proved to be too high.
Mr. Daschle and Mr. Conrad said Democrats are likely to push for a plan that will divide the $2.6 trillion surplus outside of Social Security and Medicare three ways, with a third going to tax cuts, a third to new spending and a third to additional debt reduction.

HEADLINE: Essay; 
NATO Or ERRF?

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Believers in a united European superpower have taken their vision beyond the realm of economic union. Led by French chauvinists and Brussels bureaucrats, they now espouse a military alliance without the United States, called the European Rapid Reaction Force -- ERRF, barkingly pronounced erf! 
 The non-American force would not supplant the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the go-it-alone crowd in Europe insists. With the old Soviet threat gone, erf! would "rebalance" the Atlantic Alliance by taking regional responsibility for strictly local interventions. 
 This Euro-isolationism delights American isolationists. What are we doing in the Balkans anyway? our America-firsters ask. Let Europeans take care of Europe; Lafayette, we are outta here. 
One European leader not yet in power is resisting this slow dissolution of the alliance. In a Churchillian speech defending the U.S.-European strategic relationship, William Hague, the Conservative challenger to Tony Blair's "third way" government of Britain, said: "Conservatives wanted cooperation inside NATO, to strengthen NATO. What we are getting is duplication outside NATO, to weaken NATO."
President Bush inherits a wishy-washy U.S. response to Euro-isolationism. Bill Clinton's "three D's" accepted erf! provided it did not decouple Europe from NATO, did not duplicate forces, and did not discriminate against Turkey, the NATO member outside the European Union. That was strategic sophistry: erf! is designed to do all three.
Pollsters here give the bold, bald Hague no chance of ousting Labor in elections this spring. Despite the resignation of Blair's chief political guru yesterday after a passport-influencing episode was revealed, the most that the small rightist minority is said to hope for is a gain of 80 seats in the lopsided Parliament. 
The agile Blair, Clinton's buddy, is now pulling out all the stops to get a pre-election photo op with Bush. Because meddling in the elections of democratic allies is not good policy, I hope our new president prudently waits to make a post-election date to reassert our special relationship with whomever the British choose as their prime minister.
That's also because Hague understands America's need for a missile defense against rogue-state blackmail. Although Blair, like many Europeans, nibbles his nails about an American shield lest it be seen as an invitation to a new arms race, Hague says, "I believe Britain should cooperate with the United States to the best of our ability as it develops and builds its weapons shield."
How? In Fylingdales, among the black-faced sheep of northern Yorkshire, sits a radar station built by the U.S. If expanded, it could well become an outpost much needed to track missiles on their way to North America and to plot their interception. 
The Fylingdales upgrade is resisted because any nation that cooperates with U.S. missile defense might itself become a terrorist target. For that reason, Hague wishes that the Bush administration would go beyond "a purely national missile shield." Instead, "the aim should surely be a global defense shield to which Britain could contribute its early warning radars as well as much-needed political and diplomatic support." 
This revives the original idea behind NATO. American power -- including the nuclear umbrella -- was extended across the Atlantic to protect our European allies, as their forces joined in mutual defense. In planning to cope with the threat sure to come from Iraq, Iran or some well-financed terrorist group, an American-built missile defense system should again be assisted by, and in return protect, our allies.
Therefore, we should not limit ourselves to N.M.D., a national missile defense. We should test and deploy an A.M.D., an allied missile defense, extending its reach to allies endangered by blackmailers with deliverable weapons of mass destruction.
That will be costly; only the superpower can afford it. Tests will fail and fail and ultimately succeed; only the superpower's technology can achieve it. 
The same idea that protected the free world from Communist domination for a half-century can protect the world from future terrorist intimidation. That idea is not erf! or multi-isolationism or a go-it-alone shield. It is the idea of collective security exemplified by NATO and led, as before, by a powerfully safe America.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Gives Warm Reception to New Labor Nominee 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
President Bush's nominee for labor secretary, Elaine L. Chao, was given a warm reception today at her confirmation hearing, where she vowed to fully and fairly enforce labor laws, to promote cooperation between labor and management and to emphasize training to help fill the nation's many high-technology job openings. She diplomatically refused to be pinned down on some thorny issues, including workplace safety rules and the minimum wage.
 Senators from both parties at the Education, Health, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing hailed Ms. Chao, who immigrated from Taiwan when she was 8, as the incarnation of the American dream. A former director of the Peace Corps and the United Way of America, she would be the first Asian-American woman to hold a cabinet position. 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the committee's ranking Democrat, heaped praise on her, saying, "She is an accomplished manager, graceful leader, and she has distinguished herself and her family by her strong commitment to public service."
At the end of the hearing, Mr. Kennedy assured Ms. Chao that the confirmation vote would be "very positive." Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, said today that he hoped to schedule a Senate vote next week.
The senators' warm embrace was far different from the reaction to Mr. Bush's first pick for labor secretary, Linda Chavez, who withdrew her name after disclosures that she had sheltered an illegal immigrant for two years. Labor unions had fought the Chavez selection because she opposed minimum wage laws and affirmative action, but organized labor endorsed Ms. Chao, who worked closely with labor leaders when she headed the United Way.
With Mr. Bush saying that job training is a priority and with many senators echoing corporate concerns about the shortage of high-technology workers, Ms. Chao promised to emphasize high-tech job training.
"In America today, there are tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of high-tech jobs that cannot be filled," she said. "We need to ensure that job training funds are targeted to bridge the gap between these high-skilled positions that need qualified workers, and the millions of Americans who need additional training to be able to fill them."
Saying it was time to raise the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage, James M. Jeffords, the Vermont Republican who is the labor committee's chairman, asked Ms. Chao her views.
She said Mr. Bush wanted the minimum wage increased, but only if states were allowed to opt out. This, she explained, meant states that were eager to attract jobs to economically depressed areas, could opt to keep their minimum wage at $5.15 even if Congress adopted proposals to raise the minimum to $6.15. Several Democrats said they would fight Mr. Bush's proposal for a variable minimum wage.
The committee's Democrats pressed Ms. Chao to promise not to overturn regulations, adopted by President Clinton, that seek to reduce the hundreds of thousands of ergonomic injuries, like back sprains, resulting each year from repetitive job motions or poorly designed workplaces. But several committee Republicans urged the Bush administration to alter or scrap the rules, which they said hurt business.
Noting that it was a complicated issue, Ms. Chao said she would study it before deciding.

HEADLINE: Reaching Across the Rio Grande 

 BODY:
In announcing that his first foreign trip as president will be to Mexico, George W. Bush is living up to his campaign pledge to forge a "special relationship" with that nation. Though that phrase is usually reserved for America's traditional friendship with Britain, Mr. Bush is right to set ambitious goals for strengthening relations with Mexico. Thanks to President Vicente Fox's electoral defeat of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party last year, a more democratic Mexico can be an important American ally in this hemisphere. 
 As governor of Texas, Mr. Bush routinely met with governors of northern Mexican states and spoke of America's 2,000-mile border with Mexico as a source of opportunity. Mr. Bush has often expressed his affection for Mr. Fox, another plain-spoken former businessman who feels most at home on his ranch in Guanajuato State, where the two leaders will meet in mid-February. 
 Bill Clinton recognized Mexico's economic significance when he offered that country more than $20 billion in emergency loans in 1995 after the collapse of the peso. The two economies have since become more closely linked. Mexico, a nation of 100 million people, is America's second-largest trading partner and an important source of oil. Mexico's economic growth in recent years has been fueled by exports, some 85 percent of which come to the United States. 
A closer partnership with Mexico will require reducing tensions over immigration and illicit drugs. President Fox would like to see unfettered labor movement across an open border with the United States. Though that is not realistic anytime soon, given the disparity between the two nations' living standards, a new guest-worker program is being considered that would allow more of the 350,000 Mexicans who cross the border each year to do so legally. The idea has merit, particularly if Mr. Fox agrees to help curtail illegal immigration. 
Mexico must show concrete signs of progress in stemming the flow of illegal drugs across the border. Though Mexicans once viewed the drug trade primarily as an American problem, Mr. Fox has acknowledged that the growing power of the drug cartels in Mexico is undermining the rule of law. He has vowed to crack down on corruption within various law enforcement agencies and to mobilize the army against the cartels. Previous Mexican presidents have made similar vows, to little effect.
On other issues, cooperation between the two nations is already growing. Mexico no longer reflexively counters American diplomacy as a means of asserting its own sovereignty. Its support for Fidel Castro has waned in recent years, and the Fox administration seems more willing than its PRI predecessors to take an aggressive stand for issues of democracy and human rights in the hemisphere. 
President Bush would be wise to develop a consensus with his Mexican counterpart on a broad array of hemispheric issues. Mexico has the stature and credibility in Latin America to counter the often mischievous diplomacy of Mr. Castro and Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez. A united front would be particularly valuable in addressing such issues as Peru's return to democracy and the intensifying struggle by Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, against a Marxist guerrilla rebellion, drug cartels and right-wing paramilitary groups. If Mr. Bush intends to make Latin America a centerpiece of his foreign policy, reinforcing relations with Mexico is the right way to start.

HEADLINE: REDESIGNING NATURE: Hard Lessons Learned; 
Biotechnology Food: From the Lab to a Debacle

BYLINE:  By Kurt Eichenwald; The following article is based on reporting by Kurt Eichenwald, Gina Kolata and Melody Petersen and was written by Mr. Eichenwald.

 BODY:
In late 1986, four executives of the Monsanto Company, the leader in agricultural biotechnology, paid a visit to Vice President George Bush at the White House to make an unusual pitch.
 Although the Reagan administration had been championing deregulation across multiple industries, Monsanto had a different idea: the company wanted its new technology, genetically modified food, to be governed by rules issued in Washington -- and wanted the White House to champion the idea. 
 "There were no products at the time," Leonard Guarraia, a former Monsanto executive who attended the Bush meeting, recalled in a recent interview. "But we bugged him for regulation. We told him that we have to be regulated." 
Government guidelines, the executives reasoned, would reassure a public that was growing skittish about the safety of this radical new science. Without such controls, they feared, consumers might become so wary they could doom the multibillion-dollar gamble that the industry was taking in its efforts to redesign plants using genes from other organisms -- including other species.
In the weeks and months that followed, the White House complied, working behind the scenes to help Monsanto -- long a political power with deep connections in Washington -- get the regulations that it wanted. 
It was an outcome that would be repeated, again and again, through three administrations. What Monsanto wished for from Washington, Monsanto -- and, by extension, the biotechnology industry -- got. If the company's strategy demanded regulations, rules favored by the industry were adopted. And when the company abruptly decided that it needed to throw off the regulations and speed its foods to market, the White House quickly ushered through an unusually generous policy of self-policing. 
Even longtime Washington hands said that the control this nascent industry exerted over its own regulatory destiny -- through the Environmental Protection Agency, the Agriculture Department and ultimately the Food and Drug Administration -- was astonishing.
"In this area, the U.S. government agencies have done exactly what big agribusiness has asked them to do and told them to do," said Dr. Henry Miller, a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution, who was responsible for biotechnology issues at the Food and Drug Administration from 1979 to 1994.
The outcome, at least according to some fans of the technology? "Food biotech is dead," Dr. Miller said. "The potential now is an infinitesimal fraction of what most observers had hoped it would be."
While the verdict is surely premature, the industry is in crisis. Genetically modified ingredients may be in more than half of America's grocery products. But worldwide protest has been galvanized. The European markets have banned the products and some American food producers are backing away. A recent discovery that certain taco shells manufactured by Kraft contained Starlink, a modified corn classified as unfit for human consumption, prompted a sweeping recall and did grave harm to the idea that self-regulation was sufficient. The mighty Monsanto has merged with a pharmaceutical company.
How could an industry so successful in controlling its own regulations end up in such disarray?
The answer -- pieced together from confidential industry records, court documents and government filings, as well as interviews with current and former officials of industry, government and organizations opposing the use of bioengineering in food -- provides a stunning example of how management, with a few miscalculations, can steer an industry headlong into disaster.
For many years, senior executives at Monsanto, the industry's undisputed leader, believed that they faced enormous obstacles from environmental and consumer groups opposed to the new technology. Rather than fight them, the original Monsanto strategy was to bring in opponents as consultants, hoping their participation would ease the foods' passage from the laboratory to the shopping cart.
"We thought it was at least a decade-long job, to take our efforts and present them to environmental groups and the general public, and gradually win support for this," said Earle Harbison Jr., the president and chief operating officer at Monsanto during the late 1980's.
But come the early 1990's, the strategy changed. A new management team took over at Monsanto, one confident that worries about the new technology had been thoroughly disproved by science. The go-slow approach was shelved in favor of a strategy to erase regulatory barriers and shove past the naysayers. The switch invigorated the opponents of biotechnology and ultimately dismayed the industry's allies -- the farmers, agricultural universities and food companies.
"Somewhere along the line, Monsanto specifically and the industry in general lost the recipe of how we presented our story," said Will Carpenter, the head of the company's biotechnology strategy group until 1991. "When you put together arrogance and incompetence, you've got an unbeatable combination. You can get blown up in any direction. And they were."

Biology Debate
New Microbes Bring New Fears
In the summer of 1970, Janet E. Mertz was working at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, picking up tips on animal viruses from Dr. Robert Pollack, a professor at the private research center on Long Island and a master in the field. One day she began to explain to Dr. Pollack the experiment she was planning when she returned to her graduate studies in the fall at Stanford University with her adviser, Dr. Paul Berg. They were preparing to take genes from a monkey virus and put them into a commonly used strain of bacteria, E. coli, as part of an effort to figure out the purposes of different parts of a gene.
Dr. Pollack was horrified. The virus she planned to use contained genes that could cause cancer in rodents, he reminded her. Strains of E. coli live in human intestines. What if the viral genes created a cancer-causing microbe that could be spread from person to person -- the way unmodified E. coli can. Dr. Pollack wanted Ms. Mertz's project halted immediately. .
"I said to Janet, 'There's a human experiment I don't want to be part of,' " Dr. Pollack said in a recent interview.
The resulting transcontinental shouting match between Dr. Pollack and Dr. Berg set off a debate among biologists around the world as they contemplated questions that seemed lifted from science fiction. Were genetically modified bacteria superbugs? Would they be more powerful than naturally occurring bacteria? Would scientists who wanted to study them have to move their research to the sort of secure labs used to study diseases like the black plague? 
"The notion of being able to move genes between species was an alarming thought," said Alexander Capron, a professor of law and medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. "People talked about there being species barriers -- you're reorganizing nature in some way." 
As researchers joined in the debate, they came to the conclusion that strict controls were needed on such experiments until scientists understood the implications. In 1975, the elite of the field gathered at the Asilomar conference center in Pacific Grove, Calif. There, they recommended that all molecular biologists refrain from doing certain research and abide by stringent regulations for other experiments. To monitor themselves, they set up a committee at the National Institutes of Health to review and approve all research projects.
It took just a few years -- and hundreds of experiments -- before the most urgent questions had their answers. Over and over again, scientists created bacteria with all manner of added or deleted genes and then mixed them with naturally occurring bacteria.
But rather than creating superbugs, the scientists found themselves struggling to keep the engineered bacteria from dying as the more robust naturally occurring bacteria crowded them out.
It turned out that adding almost any gene to bacteria cells only weakened them. They needed coddling in the laboratory to survive. And the E. coli that Ms. Mertz had wanted to use were among the feeblest of all.
By the mid-1980's, the Institutes of Health lifted its restrictions. Even scientists like Dr. Pollack, who sounded the initial alarm, were satisfied that the experiments were safe.
"The answer came out very clearly," he said. "Putting new genes into bacteria did not have the unintended consequence of making the bacteria dangerous."
That decision echoed through industry like the sound of a starter's pistol. First out of the gate were the pharmaceutical companies, with a rapid series of experiments on how the new science could be used in medicines. Hundreds of drugs went into development, including human insulin for diabetes, Activase for the treatment of heart attacks, Epogen for renal disease and the hepatitis B vaccine.
"It's been huge," said Dr. David Golde, physician in chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. "It has changed human health."
The success that modifying living organisms would bring the pharmaceutical industry quickly attracted attention from some of the nation's largest agricultural companies, eager to extend their staid businesses into an arena that Wall Street had endowed with such glamour.

Reaching Out
Monsanto Takes A Soft Approach
In June 1986, Mr. Harbison took control of Monsanto's push into biotechnology, a project snared in mystery and infighting. A 19-year veteran of Monsanto who had recently become its president and chief operating officer, he formed a committee to lead the charge.
"There is little more important than this task in our corporation at this time," Mr. Harbison wrote to the 13 executives selected for the assignment.
"We recognized early on," Mr. Harbison said in a recent interview, "that while developing lifesaving drugs might be greeted with fanfare, monkeying around with plants and food would be greeted with skepticism." And so Mr. Harbison drafted a plan to reach out to affected groups -- from environmentalists to farmers -- to win their support.
That same month, the company's lobbying effort for regulation began to show its first signs of success. The Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration were given authority over different aspects of the business, from field testing of new ideas to the review of new foods.
In an administration committed to deregulation, the heads of some agencies had been opposed to new rules. At an early meeting, William Ruckelshaus, then the head of the E.P.A., expressed skepticism that his agency should play any role in regulating field testing, according to people who attended. That was overcome only when Monsanto executives raised the specter of Congressional hearings about the use of biotechnology to create crops that contain their own pesticides, these people said.
By fall, Monsanto's strategy committee was developing a plan for introducing biotechnology to the public. A copy of a working draft, dated Oct. 13, 1986, listed what the committee considered the major challenges: organized opposition among environmental groups, political opportunism by elected officials and lack of knowledge among reporters about biotechnology.
It also highlighted more complex issues, including ethical questions about "tinkering with the human gene pool" and the lack of economic incentives to transfer the technology to the third world, where it would probably do the most good.
To solve political problems, the document suggested engaging elected officials and regulators around the world, "creating support for biotechnology at the highest U.S. policy levels," and working to gain endorsements for the technology in the presidential platforms of both the Republican and Democratic Parties in the 1988 election.
To deal with opponents, the document said, "Active outreach will encourage public interest, consumer and environmental groups to develop supportive positions on biotechnology, and serve as regular advisers to Monsanto."
Former Monsanto executives said that while they felt confident of the new food's overall safety, they also recognized that bioengineering raised concerns about possible allergens, unknown toxins or environmental effects. Beyond that, there was a reasonable philosophical anxiety about human manipulation of nature.
"If this business was going to work, one of the things we had to do was engage in a dialogue with all of the stakeholders, including the consumer groups and the more rational environmental organizations," said Mr. Carpenter, who headed the biotechnology strategy group. "It wasn't Nobel Prize thinking."

A Blunder
Decision on Milk Causes a Furor
Even as Monsanto was assembling its outreach strategy, other documents show that it was making strides toward what former executives now acknowledge was a major strategic blunder. The company was preparing to introduce to farmers the first product from its biotechnology program: a growth hormone produced in genetically altered bacteria. Some on the strategy committee pushed for marketing a porcine hormone that would produce leaner and bigger hogs. 
But, simply because the product was further along in development, the company decided to go forward with a bovine growth hormone, which improves milk production in cows -- despite vociferous objections of executives who feared that tinkering with a product consumed by children would ignite a national outcry. 
"It was not a wise choice to go out with that product first," Mr. Harbison acknowledged. "It was a mistake."
Scientists who watched the events remain stunned by Monsanto's decisions. 
"I don't think they really thought through the whole darn thing," Dr. Virginia Walbot, a professor of biological sciences at Stanford University, said of Monsanto's decision to market products that benefited farmers rather than general consumers. "The way Thomas Edison demonstrated how great electricity was was by providing lights for the first nighttime baseball game. People were in awe. What if he had decided to demonstrate the electric chair instead? And what if his second product had been the electric cattle prod? Would we have electricity today?"
The decision touched off a furor. Jeremy Rifkin, director of the Foundation on Economic Trends, an opponent of biotechnology, joined with family-farm groups worried about price declines and other organizations in a national campaign to keep the Monsanto hormone out of the marketplace. Some supermarket chains shunned the idea; several dairy states moved to ban it. The first step toward the shopping cart brought only bad news.
One year later, in 1987, the E.P.A. agreed to allow another company, Advanced Genetic Sciences, to test bioengineered bacteria meant to make plants resistant to frost. But under the agency's guidelines, it had to declare the so-called ice-minus bacteria a new pesticide -- classifying frost as the pest.
On April 28 and May 28, strawberry and potato plants were sprayed in two California cities. Photographs of scientists in regulation protective gear -- spacesuits with respirators -- were broadcast around the world, generating widespread alarm.
"It was surreal," said Dr. Steven Lindow, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who helped develop the bacteria.
For the executives at Monsanto, these troubling experiences reinforced their commitment to the strategy of inclusion and persuasion.
The most complex challenge came in Europe, where there was deep distrust of the new foods, particularly among politically powerful farmers. Faced with such resistance, Mr. Harbison said Monsanto began subtly shifting its attention from the lucrative European market to Asia and Africa. The hope was that the economic realities of a global agricultural marketplace would eventually push Europe toward a more conciliatory attitude.
But by the early 1990's, company executives said, everything would change. Mr. Harbison retired. Soon, Monsanto's strategy for biotechnology was being overseen by Robert Shapiro, the former head of Monsanto's Nutrasweet unit, who in 1990 had been named head of the agricultural division.
In no time, former executives said, the strategy inside the company began to change. Mr. Shapiro demonstrated a devout sense of mission about his new responsibilities, these executives said. He repeatedly expressed his belief that Monsanto could help change the world by championing bioengineered agriculture, while simultaneously turning in stellar financial results.
Eager to get going, he shelved the go-slow strategy of consultation and review. Monsanto would now use its influence in Washington to push through a new approach. 
Mr. Carpenter, the former head of the company's biotechnology strategy group, recalled going to a meeting with Mr. Shapiro, and cautioning that it seemed risky to tamper with a strategic approach that had worked well for the company in the past. But, he said, Mr. Shapiro dismissed his concerns.
"Shapiro ignored the stakeholders and almost insulted them and proceeded to spend all of his political coin trying to deal directly with the government on a political basis rather than an open basis," Mr. Carpenter said. 
Mr. Shapiro, now the nonexecutive chairman of the Pharmacia Corporation, which Monsanto merged with last year, declined to comment. But in an essay published earlier this year by Washington University in St. Louis, he acknowledged that Monsanto had suffered from some of the very faults cited now by critics. 'We've learned that there is often a very fine line between scientific confidence on the one hand and corporate arrogance on the other," he wrote. "It was natural for us to see this as a scientific issue. We didn't listen very well to people who insisted that there were relevant ethical, religious, cultural, social and economic issues as well."

Turning Point
Objections By Scientists
On May 26, 1992, the vice president, Dan Quayle, proclaimed the Bush administration's new policy on bioengineered food. 
"The reforms we announce today will speed up and simplify the process of bringing better agricultural products, developed through biotech, to consumers, food processors and farmers," Mr. Quayle told a crowd of executives and reporters in the Indian Treaty Room of the Old Executive Office Building. "We will ensure that biotech products will receive the same oversight as other products, instead of being hampered by unnecessary regulation."
With dozens of new grocery products waiting in the wings, the new policy strictly limited the regulatory reach of the F.D.A, which had oversight responsibility for foods headed to market.
The announcement -- a salvo in the Bush administration's "regulatory relief" program -- was in lock step with the new position of industry that science had proved safety concerns to be baseless. 
"We will not compromise safety one bit," Mr. Quayle told his audience.
In the F.D.A.'s nearby offices, not everyone was so sure. 
Among them was Dr. Louis J. Pribyl, one of 17 government scientists working on a policy for genetically engineered food. Dr. Pribyl knew from studies that toxins could be unintentionally created when new genes were introduced into a plant's cells. But under the new edict, the government was dismissing that risk and any other possible risk as no different from those of conventionally derived food. That meant biotechnology companies would not need government approval to sell the foods they were developing.
"This is the industry's pet idea, namely that there are no unintended effects that will raise the F.D.A.'s level of concern," Dr. Pribyl wrote in a fiery memo to the F.D.A. scientist overseeing the policy's development. "But time and time again, there is no data to back up their contention."
Dr. Pribyl, a microbiologist, was not alone at the agency. Dr. Gerald Guest, director of the center of veterinary medicine, wrote that he and other scientists at the center had concluded there was "ample scientific justification" to require tests and a government review of each genetically engineered food before it was sold.
Three toxicologists wrote, "The possibility of unexpected, accidental changes in genetically engineered plants justifies a limited traditional toxicological study." 
The scientists were displaying precisely the concerns that Monsanto executives from the 1980's had anticipated -- and indeed had considered reasonable. But now, rather than trying to address those concerns, Monsanto, the industry and official Washington were dismissing them as the insignificant worries of the uninformed. Under the final F.D.A. policy that the White House helped usher in, the new foods would be tested only if companies did it. Labeling was ruled out as potentially misleading to the consumer, since it might suggest that there was reason for concern.
"Monsanto forgot who their client was," said Thomas N. Urban, retired chairman and chief executive of Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a seed company. "If they had realized their client was the final consumer they should have embraced labeling. They should have said, 'We're for it.' They should have said, 'We insist that food be labeled.' They should have said, 'I'm the consumer's friend here.' There was some risk. But the risk was a hell of a lot less."
Even some who presumably benefited directly from the new policy remain surprised that it was adopted. "How could you argue against labeling?" said Roger Salquist, the former chief executive of Calgene, whose Flavr Savr tomato, engineered for slower spoilage, was the first fruit of biotechnology to reach the grocery store. "The public trust has not been nurtured," he added.
In fact, the F.D.A. policy was just what the small band of activists opposed to biotechnology needed to rally powerful global support to their cause.
"That was the turning point," said Jeremy Rifkin, the author and activist who in 1992 had already spent more than a decade trying to stop biotechnology experiments. Immediately after Vice President Quayle announced the F.D.A.'s new policy, Mr. Rifkin began calling for a global moratorium on biotechnology as part of an effort that he and others named the "pure food campaign."
He quickly began spreading the word to small activist groups around the world that the United States had decided to let the biotechnology industry put the foods on store shelves without tests or labels. Mr. Rifkin said that he got support from dozens of small farming, consumer and animal rights groups in more than 30 countries. In Europe, these small groups helped turn the public against genetically altered foods, tearing up farm fields and holding protests before television cameras.
If the F.D.A. had required tests and labels, Mr. Rifkin said, "it would have been more difficult for us to mobilize the opposition."
Today, the handful of nonprofit groups that joined Mr. Rifkin's in lobbying the F.D.A. for stronger regulation in 1992 have multiplied to 54. Those groups, including the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Public Citizen and the Humane Society of the United States, signed a petition this spring demanding that the government take genetically engineered foods off the market until they are tested and labeled.
"There is absolutely no question that the voluntary nature of the policy was unacceptable to many," said Andrew Kimbrell, one of the early activists to oppose biotechnology and now the executive director of the Center for Food Safety, which filed the petition.
The F.D.A. policy has also helped organizations like Mr. Kimbrell's raise money. In late 1998 groups opposed to biotechnology approached the hundreds of foundations that give regularly to environmental causes and told them about the government's decision to let the companies regulate themselves. Since then, the foundations have given the groups several million dollars out of concern over the policy, said Christina Desser, a lawyer in San Francisco involved in the fund-raising effort.
There was also an about-face in the approach to dealing with overseas markets. As the Clinton administration came to Washington, Monsanto maintained its close ties to policy makers -- particularly to trade negotiators. For example, Mr. Shapiro was friends with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade negotiator who would eventually be named a Monsanto director. 
Confrontation in trade negotiations became the order of the day. Senior administration officials publicly disparaged the concerns of European consumers as the products of conservative minds unfamiliar with the science.
"You can't put a gun to their head," Mr. Harbison said of the toughened trade strategy with Europe. "It just won't sell."
And it didn't. Protests erupted in Europe, and genetically modified foods became the rallying point of a vast political opposition. Exports of the foods slowed to a stop. With a vocal and powerful opposition growing in both Europe and America, the perceived promise of biotechnology foods began to slip away.
By the end of the decade, the magnitude of Monsanto's error in abandoning its slow, velvet-glove strategy of the 1980's was apparent. Mr. Shapiro himself acknowledged as much. In the fall of 1999, he appeared at a conference sponsored by Greenpeace, the environmental group and major biotechnology critic.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Belgian Software Maker Said to Have Pact for Rescue Loan

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER with RIVA D. ATLAS 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products N.V., the struggling maker of voice-recognition software, has reached a preliminary agreement on $60 million in rescue financing from a New York firm, according to an executive who has been briefed on the plan.
 Lernout & Hauspie, based in Ieper, Belgium, will go before a bankruptcy judge in Camden, N.J., on Thursday to get permission to release funds that will allow the lender, Ableco Finance L.L.C., to conduct due diligence for the rescue package, according to the executive. Ableco Finance specializes in making secured loans to troubled or bankrupt companies. Ableco is an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund. 
 Ableco has committed itself to lend at least $20 million, which will go to repay a bridge loan from GE Capital made to Lernout & Hauspie late last year. An additional $40 million, which would finance the company's operations, was contingent upon Ableco's review of Lernout's operations, according to the executive. The review must be completed by Feb. 7, the executive said. Lernout & Hauspie declined to comment on the court hearing and on the finance package. A person close to the company, however, said that Abelco's terms were "a lot better than those offered by GE Capital."
A spokesman for GE Capital confirmed that it had provided a loan facility of as much as $20 million, but declined to say how much of it had been tapped by Lernout & Hauspie.
Ableco's terms include an interest rate of 11.5 percent on the financing. The loan is in first position in the line of creditors waiting to be repaid by the ailing company.
Lernout & Hauspie filed for bankruptcy in Belgium and the United States last fall. It is also under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic after revelations of a $100 million cash shortfall in the company's South Korean unit and questionable accounting practices companywide. A new chief executive -- the third in six months -- was appointed last week. The new chief, Philippe Bodson, was chosen as much for his financial contacts in the United States as for his track record as a manager, analysts in Brussels said.
Ableco makes around $950 million of loans a year, with the average financing $20 million to $60 million, according to an executive close to negotiations.
Because of its affiliation with Cerberus, which specializes in investing in distressed securities, Ableco is often willing to invest in deals that larger, traditional secured lenders, like GE Capital, might turn down, the executive said.

HEADLINE: G.M. and Ford Set To Close 7 Plants 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
General Motors and Ford said today that they would idle a combined seven North American assembly plants in hopes of winnowing bloated inventories.
 G.M. said it would temporarily close five plants for the week. 
Those sites and their products are: Oklahoma City, Chevrolet Malibu; Oshawa, Ontario, Buick Century and Buick Regal; Orion Township, Mich., Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile Aurora and Pontiac Bonneville; Lordstown, Ohio, Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire; and Hamtramck, Mich., Cadillac Seville, LeSabre and Cadillac DeVille. 
 All of tho shutdowns, which G.M. said would affect about 14,400 workers, were previously announced, except for the Hamtramck plant.
Ford said the two van plants it would idle were in Avon Lake, Ohio, where the Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest are made, and in Lorain, Ohio, where the Ford Econoline is produced.
Those plants employ 4,150 hourly workers, a Ford spokesman, Ed Miller, said.

HEADLINE: California's Lawmakers Submit an Energy Relief Proposal 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Encouraged by signs that the state could persuade generating companies to sell power to California at sharply reduced prices, Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders have drafted a comprehensive financial package for resolving the simmering energy crisis.
 Robert M. Hertzberg, the speaker of the State Assembly, submitted a roughly 35-page package of measures today to restore the state's ailing utilities to financial health and make the state government the major buyer and seller of electricity. 
 While some consumer advocates condemned the package as a bailout for the battered utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, the bill represented the first practical step by the state's political leaders for providing a long-term solution to the crisis. 
The bill would provide a way for the utilities to repay close to $12 billion in debt they incurred in recent months because of soaring wholesale prices for energy, allow the state to sell bonds to finance its own long-term purchases of energy for consumers and possibly grant the state stock warrants in the utilities, so if the prices of their shares rise in response to the plan, taxpayers would benefit.
In addition, Governor Davis, who has been slow to throw his weight behind any specific plans of this breadth, is preparing a package of proposals to increase conservation across the state and hasten the construction of new power plants, his aides said.
"Let's be clear about the stakes," Mr. Hertzberg said. "The California dream of a better life is in danger if we do not immediately move to return stability to our power supply."
The utilities have expressed reservations about some aspects of the plan; in particular, they have not embraced the idea of granting the state stock warrants. But utility officials said that over all, the proposals looked good and they were encouraged that their flirtation with bankruptcy could end if the package is passed.
"Reality is setting in," said Bob Foster, a senior vice president at Southern California Edison and the utility's leader at the negotiations in Sacramento. "Everybody's perception of the reality is getting narrower and more focused. Everybody is faced with difficult choices, but they're closer to making them."
He added: "I think people are getting comfortable with the major elements of the plan. Any reasonable proposal that could solve this problem and bring us closer to becoming a viable economic entity we'd look at."
Although some Republicans in the Democratic-dominated Legislature have said they did not agree with some details, they have also said they would support the package if some changes were made.
"This is the first time it's been drafted and then discussed in a public forum," said Bill Campbell, the Republican leader in the Assembly, "and that is what has to happen now to move it forward." 
A critical piece of the puzzle was an auction the state held on Wednesday. It had sought offers for long-term power supply contracts, and said it received packages from 39 bidders. Governor Davis had said he was seeking top bids of about $55 a megawatt hour. Late Wednesday the state said that the weighted average price was $69 a megawatt hour, and the governor called that close enough to begin negotiations, a fact that heartened most of those involved.
Today, state officials would say no more about the precise contents of those offers, saying they did not want to harm the negotiations that would commence soon. Larry Makovich, the senior director for electricity generation research at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, called the bids "a stopgap measure" that would not affect the core problem of short supplies of power.
Among the provisions in the bill, and other measures being considered, are these: 
*A 90-day emergency increase in power rates approved last month, which lifted residential charges about 9 percent, would be extended, probably for several years.
*About six-tenths of a cent to 1.2 cents out of every utility bill would be put in a special fund dedicated to helping the two utilities pay off the $12 billion or so in losses they have suffered in recent months because of soaring wholesale energy prices. 
*The state would sell revenue bonds totaling many billions of dollars to purchase power in long-term contracts and, as needed, on a day to day basis, to make up for the amounts the utilities cannot supply.
*The state would reduce the cost at which the utilities must purchase power produced by companies with cogenerating facilities or that have wind or other renewable power generation.
*In return for providing this support and relief to the utilities, the state would receive some financial benefit, perhaps stock warrants. If the shares of the utilities rebounded because of this stabilization plan, the value of the warrants would rise. 
These warrants could then be sold, and the proceeds be used to pay off the revenue bonds.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Peaks and Plateaus of a Volatile Year Surveyed

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Now that the books are closed on the gyrating Manhattan real estate market of 2000, surveys by two leading brokerage firms give a clearer picture of what happened.
 They indicate that prices dropped significantly as the Nasdaq stock index began its plunge, then rebounded substantially in the third quarter before slipping again slightly by year's end. 
 Although the steep price increases of recent years eased a bit for all Manhattan apartment sales, prices for co-ops -- traditionally less expensive than condominiums -- continued to rise through the year, even as condominium prices moderated somewhat in the third and fourth quarters.
And brokers say that prices have generally held steady during the first weeks of the new year. 
The overall average price for co-ops and condominiums sold during the fourth quarter of 2000 was $787,708, according to the Douglas Elliman Market Report. That was essentially unchanged from the $789,225 average in the third quarter, but was 38 percent higher than at the end of 1999, when the average was $569,005.
In fact, the year-end average was only 7.8 percent below the record average price of $854,704 set in the second quarter -- just before the Nasdaq began a 34 percent drop, from 5,048 on March 10 to 3,321 on April 14.
"The volatility in recent years really came to a head in the second quarter when we saw that record of $854,704," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares the Elliman report. "Now I see some continuity, and I think that bodes well for the long term because double-digit appreciation isn't sustainable indefinitely."
But Manhattan real estate has been a good investment. The average price of an apartment at the end of 2000 was essentially double the average $395,035 recorded a decade ago. Even after being adjusted for inflation, the average price tag in the fourth quarter of 1990 was 29.6 percent less than it was at the same point in 2000. (The Elliman report examined 8,799 sales during the year, from Wall Street to West 116th Street and East 96th Street.)
Similar patterns were evident in the report compiled for the Corcoran Group by the Mitchell, Maxwell & Jackson appraisal company. According to the Corcoran Report, the average price at the end of 2000 was $754,000, up 23 percent from $614,000 at the end of 1999. (The report covered 10,332 transactions from Wall Street to 116th Street.)
During the first quarter of 2000 alone, said Barbara Corcoran, the firm's founder, the average jumped 22 percent from the end of 1999, to $750,000. Then, Ms. Corcoran said, it slipped by 4 percent to $723,000. There was a 5 percent rise to $759,000 in the third quarter, followed by a 1 percent slip to $754,000 by year's end.
"It seems that at the same moment, everyone in New York decided they caught a cold," said Ms. Corcoran, who easily admits to a broker's ever-ready optimism. "Nobody really has a cold, but everybody's agreeing that they caught something.
"Asking prices are softer, sellers are more willing to deal, and bidding over the asking price, except for the choicest properties, seems a thing of the past."
The two studies found that co-op and condominium prices followed somewhat different paths.
The Elliman survey looked at 5,193 co-op sales and 3,606 condominium sales. As had long been the pattern, condominiums, which are generally newer, tended to be higher priced than co-ops.
Average co-op prices, the Elliman report said, rose to $710,947 in the fourth quarter of 2000 from $508,210 at the end of 1999 -- with most of the gain coming in the first six months. 
Condominium prices rose to $952,164 at the end of 2000 from an average $695,815 at the end of 1999. They jumped 50 percent during the first six months of the year, dropped 8.5 percent in the third quarter and were virtually unchanged, at minus 0.3 percent, in the fourth quarter.
The Corcoran Report indicated that the average price for studio apartments was $193,000 at the end of 2000 (up 21 percent from the end of 1999); $371,000 for one-bedrooms (a 32 percent jump); $843,000 for two-bedrooms (a 27 percent increase); and $1,689,000 for three-bedrooms (up 13 percent).
Mr. Miller was cautiously optimistic about the new year. Despite volatility in the stock markets, the average difference between list price and sales price remained below 2 percent for all of 2000, ending at 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter. "If they are close like that, it means there is still some upward pressure, albeit modest," Mr. Miller said.
"Couple that with actions taken by the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates," he said, "and we may see more of the same over the next few months."

Chart: "BY THE NUMBERS: Turning Down the Heat"
While average co-op prices in Manhattan increased somewhat in the last half of 2000, condominium resale prices eased. Sales are from Wall Street to East 96th and West 116th Streets. Figures are plotted quarterly.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Bet on Growth But Doesn't Love Payoff 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Ten floors above the bail bondsmen, the sunburned homeless and the wedding ministers-for-hire that dominate downtown, Mayor Oscar B. Goodman of Las Vegas looks out at the gleaming carpet of urban expansion covering the Mojave Desert as far as the eye can see and utters a civic blasphemy.
 "Look at all those gated communities, those big beautiful houses where people don't know their neighbors and never talk to anyone," Mr. Goodman says. "It's nothing but -- I'm not supposed to say this -- sprawl!" 
 The mayor, who boasts of being a longtime lawyer for the mob and sprinkles his comments with wise-guy threats like "I oughtta throw them out this window," has become a most unlikely New Urbanist: He presides over the heart of a metropolis growing by 6,000 people a month while preaching the virtues of limitation. 
The 2000 census shows that the Las Vegas metropolitan area remains the fastest-growing region in the country, adding about 70,000 people a year to a population of 1.4 million. But troubles abound for this city that was but a gleam in Bugsy Siegel's eye 55 years ago, from bad air to choked traffic to diminishing water supplies to a squalid downtown ignored by the big-money casinos that are just beyond the city limits on the Las Vegas Strip.
"Las Vegas has become Orange County with casinos," said D. Taylor, an official with the Culinary Workers' Union, referring to the sprawling county southeast of Los Angeles. Mr. Taylor's union represents a majority of the bartenders, busmen, cooks and maids who keep the casino factories running for 35 million visitors a year. 
Mayor Goodman has big plans. He wants the core of his city to have "some culture," as he calls it, and a monorail, restaurants, apartments, grocery stores, bookstores, boutiques, a stadium, a high tech center, a museum, an art school -- in other words, the vital mix of ingredients that make up a healthy downtown. He wants all of this to happen soon -- or else.
"I represented the mob -- I don't fool around," Mr. Goodman said. "What Oscar wants, Oscar gets."
What Oscar Goodman wants is for Sin City to be a real city. But it is one thing to transform a mile-long strip of sand into fantasy replicas of Venice, Paris, New York and ancient Egypt, as the casino conglomerates have done just a few miles from downtown. There, giant television screens flash words that could pass for the civic mantra of Las Vegas: "Defeat Reality."
But it is another thing to get people to move downtown, to give up their cars, 3,000 square feet of stucco-encased home and a half acre of Mojave dirt for a high rise with a view of the "Defeat Reality" signs.
For if Las Vegas is the Detroit of the New Century, as some demographers have called it, the city appears to be following the pattern of the Detroit of the Old Century -- with the most striking growth happening in largely white, new suburban communities planted a good distance from the neighborhoods that once made up the vital center of the city. 
The fastest-growing city in the nation is not Las Vegas proper, which accounts for only a third of the people in the metropolitan area of Clark County, but Henderson, 10 miles to the southeast. Henderson has grown to 200,000 residents from 69,000 people 10 years ago and is expected to have a population of 560,000, or "full build out," in developer argot, within a generation. 
Henderson -- "A Place to Call Home," as its official motto says -- is a clutter of bulldozers and timber frames, sienna-colored cement walls, burlap-wrapped palm trees in midtransplant, and real estate flags flying above streets without names at the end of an unfinished highway. Some of the gasoline stations have Tuscan-style water fountains in the front, and there are so many new gated communities under construction that developers have run out of evocative Spanish and Italian names and started to recycle California names, like Napa and Sonoma. 
And California is the source of many of Henderson's new residents, who are fleeing high real estate prices, taxes and traffic for the new frontier in the middle of the Mojave, state population figures show. Many nouveau Hendersonians are baby boomers retiring early.
"We're in the midst of migration from the old Sun Belt to the new Sun Belt," said Bill Frey, a demographer from the University of Michigan and the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, Calif. "California, for example, is never going to be the draw that it used to be for a majority of new people, because it is simply not affordable."
The recent census showed that Nevada, with a 66 percent population growth rate over the last decade, and Arizona, with a 40 percent rate, were the nation's two fastest-growing states. These states, characterized by gangly, growth-spurt towns like Henderson, or Gilbert, Ariz., near Phoenix, which has grown to 112,000 people from 29,000 in 1990, are drawing what Mr. Frey calls "the yuppie elderly" -- people retiring early and looking for active entertainment. 
Arizona and Nevada are also attracting young, largely immigrant families, who find easy jobs in the booming service and construction economy and can afford to buy homes at the suburban fringe, where three-bedroom-two-bath houses sell for as low as $120,000.
"We moved to Las Vegas because here we can buy a house and get health insurance," said Andy Dunngrudeeswat, an immigrant from Thailand, who lived out of the back of a car wash in Los Angeles before moving to Las Vegas. Here, Mr. Dunngrudeeswat and his wife have been able to save enough money to buy a new house. He makes $13.63 an hour as a fry cook at Paris, the theme hotel on the Strip with its own Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. 
The question some people in Las Vegas are asking is how long until this region resembles the places from which people are fleeing. Yes, the median price for a new home is inexpensive compared with prices in neighboring California -- $158,000, or practically one-fourth the cost of a new house in the four counties of Silicon Valley. 
But the prices of houses here are rising quickly -- up 11 percent last year -- far exceeding the median rise in household income. Bad air and clogged traffic are major concerns, so much so that the Environmental Protection Agency has said Las Vegas could lose some federal money if it does not take steps to clean its air. 
The smog is in large measure a result of auto traffic and dust from construction of new houses, federal officials say -- a hint that the Vegas boom may be creating the foundation of its own decline.
"We have perhaps 10 years left until we have to stop growing horizontally and have to grow vertically," said Mayor Goodman, whose office is officially nonpartisan. 
Another concern is that half of all jobs in Las Vegas are generally low-wage service-economy jobs -- the highest percentage of such jobs of any major American city. Nevada leads the nation in new job growth, but this region is starved for high-paying technology jobs. The best way to bring in technology talent, the mayor says, is to build the center of Las Vegas into a multidimensional urban area.
Whether retiring early or just entering the work force from a foreign country, the newcomers of metropolitan Las Vegas are not settling in the places where Mayor Goodman would like them to. While more than 20,000 houses were built in this area last year, there is still virtually no housing downtown, a hodgepodge of government buildings, parking lots and small offices. 
The older neighborhoods close to the city -- somewhat of an oxymoron, given that Las Vegas was basically a train depot with barely 8,000 souls in 1940 -- are run down, with few services. 
As the demographic tide flushes through Las Vegas to its newest suburbs, people like Dora Fribush, late of Baltimore, would seem to be just the kind of people the mayor is looking to attract. She and her husband, a stockbroker who works out of his house, looked at living in downtown Las Vegas but were lured to Henderson, to a $4.3 billion planned community called Lake Las Vegas Resort.
"When I told my friends we were moving to Las Vegas, they said, 'What are you going to do -- be a showgirl?" said Ms. Fribush, 52.
She looked at parts of Florida but thought the areas were too narrowly focused around older retirees, and California, which was too congested for her taste.
"I love the light here," Ms. Fribush said. "I love the space. But I do have some concerns about it being overdeveloped."
She has marveled at how quickly people, and places, have reinvented themselves in the desert.
Reinvention, another civic byword, is what Mayor Goodman would like for Las Vegas. A native of Philadelphia who moved to Las Vegas in 1964, Mr. Goodman has represented clients from Anthony Spilotro to Meyer Lansky. Since taking office 18 months ago, he has made "reurbanization," his No. 1 goal, using decidedly non-tough-guy lines like "we need places where the public can exchange social dialogue."
He has helped lure a company to build some low-income housing in the central city, smoothed the way for the first new downtown office building in 20 years -- a modest six-story structure -- and persuaded the Federal Bureau of Investigation to keep its regional headquarters here, instead of moving to Henderson. 
The last effort brought a letter from the F.B.I. to the mayor, noting that he had once said he would rather have his daughter date a member of the mob than an F.B.I. agent, and wondering if he still felt that way.
"I'm reconsidering," Mr. Goodman said.
But his biggest coup, the mayor said, was to acquire 61 vacant acres, once owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. On this land, he vows, Las Vegas will rebuild itself.
"My 61 acres downtown -- this is the greatest land swap since they took New York from the Indians for $24," Mr. Goodman said.
Though no specific plans have been announced, Mr. Goodman said he was encouraging any combination of apartments, offices, stores, cultural centers and a stadium to take root on the empty 61 acres.
But a city with 125,000 hotel rooms and only seven miles of bike paths could have trouble creating a vibrant new urban core when most of the civic energy, and certainly the money, is just beyond the city limits. On the Strip, the casinos are building a $600 million, three-mile extension to an existing one-mile monorail, the largest privately financed mass transit system in the nation.
The monorail will not extend the logical next few miles to downtown, meaning it serves only the millions of gamblers and gawkers who float though this town. 
Of late, Mr. Goodman has been critical of the major casino owners, saying they have not done their share to invest in the city beyond the Strip. He has even threatened to annex the Strip. 
"I'd like to see them extend the monorail to my 61 acres," he said. "These casinos -- they don't have to keep people hostage. They ought to let them out for a little air a few hours a day, and then they can let them go back to losing money."
If Las Vegas does not act to channel the additional half-million people expected to move here in the next decade into some semblance of dense, vibrant city, the mayor said, then it is only inviting the kinds of urban ills that have plagued older cities. But then again, he is not so sure what to make of the metropolis growing fat in the Mojave.
"Las Vegas is either the most unreal place in the world or the most real place," Mr. Goodman said. "I've lived here 37 years, and I've yet to figure out which it is."

BRITAIN: ASYLUM SEEKERS SET RECORD
Britain recorded its highest annual number of asylum seekers in 2000, more than 76,000, up 5,000 from the year before. The rise occurred even as the Labor government, accused by the opposition Conservatives of turning Britain into a "soft touch" for bogus applicants, tightened entry measures and speeded up processing. The Home Office said a backlog of applications had been reduced from 100,000 to 66,000. Warren Hoge (NYT)

FRANCE: STRIKE HITS CITIES
Tens of thousands of French workers and retirees paralyzed transportation services in several major cities, protesting plans to change the way their pension funds are run. In a rare gesture of solidarity, France's combative public-sector trade unions joined private-sector employees in taking to the streets. The protesters are angry at the country's largest employers' group, which wants to increase the amount employees pay into their retirement funds. Suzanne Daley (NYT)

GERMANY: NAZI PAYOUT DELAYED
Nazi victim groups and German officials said they feared further delays in compensation payments to surviving Nazi-era slave laborers after a New York court deferred a ruling over outstanding litigation against German banks. Under the terms of the compensation deal, all outstanding suits against German companies over their Nazi past must be dismissed before payments from a $4.8 billion fund can begin.

ITALY: A PAT IS NOT A CRIME
Italy's highest appeals court upheld a verdict that a pat on the bottom does not amount to sexual harassment. A man was sentenced to 18 months and a $4,000 fine, but the conviction was overturned. The woman charged he also threatened to block her career if she denounced him. The court ruled that a pat that is "isolated and impulsive" should not be considered a crime. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)

HEADLINE: Economic Groups Call for New Power Supplies 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
Some of New York City's most powerful economic interest groups, including the Building and Construction Trades Council and the Real Estate Board, said yesterday that they feared that the city would face an energy crisis as early as this summer, and urged that new electricity supplies be installed as quickly as possible.
 A report by the groups released at a news conference in Manhattan offered no new solutions to the combined problems of rising electricity demand and unregulated energy prices, which were first felt in New York City last summer, when many residents and businesses saw energy bills increase as much as 40 percent in one month. 
 But electricity experts and environmental groups said the report would probably heighten both the anxiety in the region and the pressure on politicians to take action because of the large economic influence of the sponsoring organizations and the urgency of their words. 
The groups' core message was that the signature elements of economic life in New York -- Wall Street, the vast transit systems and the high-rise buildings that dominate the city's landscape and culture -- all hang by an invisible thread: ample electricity at a reasonable price.
"The decisions of businesses to expand or relocate to the city -- and thus the health of the city's economy -- will largely be determined by the sufficient supply and price of electricity," the report said.
Consolidated Edison, which delivers electricity to New York City and its northern suburbs, said this month that while it would probably have enough power to run the system this summer, assuming normal weather conditions, it might fall as much as 300 megawatts short in the amount of electricity that must be generated within the city's borders.
This does not necessarily mean that New York will not have enough electricity to run its lights, computers and air-conditioners, the company said, but that there might not be enough extra electricity to maintain reliability under the most extreme conditions.
Some citizen groups and environmentalists who are resisting the pressure to build new power plants in New York say that the projections of a shortfall have since been whittled by incremental growth in capacity at the city's plants and that the situation might not be as dire as yesterday's report suggests. They add that the business and construction groups counted only part of the economic costs of the electricity equation in reaching their conclusions.
"Power plants are pollution sources," said E. Gail Suchman, a senior environmental counsel at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest and a technical adviser to Communities United for Responsible Energy, a citywide coalition. "They affect people's health and waterfront development and open-space development -- there's an economic cost associated with those things, too. What we have here is a hysterical environment where everybody is playing on people's fears," she said.
The groups, which also included the New York Building Congress, the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce and the Association for a Better New York, also advocated conservation measures and proposals that would make it easier for companies to generate their own electricity.
But those measures, the group said, will not be enough, especially in the future, partly because some of the city's power plants are getting old and will have to be replaced.

PHELPS DODGE SAYS ENERGY COSTS MAY FORCE LAYOFFS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The Phelps Dodge Corporation, the world's No. 2 copper producer, warned yesterday that it might reduce production and lay off as many as 2,350 employees at mines in New Mexico and Arizona because high energy costs in California had spilled over into nearby states. 
High electricity, diesel and natural gas prices had a significant effect on mines in Chino and Tyrone, N.M.; and Sierrita, Ariz., Phelps Dodge said. Those mines accounted for a quarter of the company's copper output last year. Its fourth-quarter energy costs rose 65 percent.

BRUNSWICK TO CLOSE 4 PLANTS AND LAY OFF 650 WORKERS

BYLINE:  Reuters

 BODY:
 The Brunswick Corporation, the world's largest maker of pleasure boats, said yesterday that it would close four plants and warned that its 2001 earnings would be lower than expected. The company, based in Lake Forest, Ill., said it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 7 percent of the workers in its boat group, when the plants closed at the end of March. The announcement came as the company posted a 4 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit. Brunswick, also the largest maker of marine engines, said it expected its first-quarter profit to fall short of analysts' estimates. Its shares fell 50 cents, to $18.81.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Increases Tolls And Train Fare 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey voted yesterday to raise tolls at bridges and tunnels for the first time in a decade, and to increase fares on PATH commuter trains. But after sharp criticism at public hearings last week, the agency decided against even steeper increases proposed in November.
 The fare on PATH trains will rise to $1.50 from $1. The cash tolls at bridges and tunnels connecting New Jersey and New York City will rise to $6 at all times for automobile drivers, up from $4. E-ZPass users will pay $5 at peak hours and $4 at other times. 
 The new fares, adopted after intense discussions between Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey over the last two days, go into effect March 25. 
The new prices reflect the board's determination to keep tolls lower for E-ZPass users, and to give them even greater discounts at nonrush hours. 
The so-called congestion-pricing schemes are meant not only to encourage drivers to get the time-saving E-ZPass transponders but also to offer drivers lower tolls for traveling in less congested times.
Under the modified plan, approved by a vote of 10 to 1 with one member not present, the board decreased its proposed new PATH fare to $1.50 from $2 for a one-way trip. It is now $1. The PATH trains are used by 116,000 riders a day.
The new $6 cash toll for cars is a dollar lower than the cost originally proposed at the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and the George Washington and the Staten Island bridges to New Jersey, which are used by 123 million vehicles a year. 
But E-ZPass holders will pay only $5 at peak hours, between 6 and 9 a.m. and 4 and 7 p.m., and $4 at nonpeak hours. The original plan provided off-peak discounts to E-ZPass users that ranged from $3 to $6, depending on the bridge or tunnel used and the time of travel. 
The current 50-cents-a-trip toll for carpools of three or more occupants who purchase up to 30 trips in advance will increase to $1.
For trucks, the modified plan charges the same $6 one-way toll per axle for cash payers at all times, as well as for E-ZPass-equipped trucks at peak hours. But truckers with E-ZPass can cross for $5 per axle at off-peak hours, and pay as little as $3.50 between midnight and 6 a.m.
PATH fares have not been raised since 1987, and tolls on the bridges and tunnels have not risen since 1991.
Governor Whitman endorsed the modified plan in a statement saying that it did not "place an unfair burden" on New Jerseyans, who make up 62 percent of the users of the bridge and tunnel crossings and 55 percent of PATH users.
Brad Race, the secretary to Governor Pataki and a member of the port agency board who favored the modified plan, said that while "nobody is ever happy to raise tolls," Mr. Pataki supported the plan and believed that it "minimized" the impact on commuters.
But there were some critics.
The Hudson County executive, Robert Janiszewski, said in a statement that he thought authority members "would listen to the concerns of commuters and see the faults within their proposal," but was disappointed.
Matthew L. Wright, president of Apgar Brothers, a trucking company in Bound Brook, N.J., and a board member of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, said the new toll schedule would result in "a huge increase" in costs for many trucking companies. 
Mr. Apgar noted that the previous rate of $4 per axle, which applied to all times of day or night, whether paid in cash or E-ZPass, meant a cost of $20 per crossing for a five-axle truck. At the new rate, the same truck will pay $30 in cash at all times or E-ZPass during peak hours. 
Many truckers will be unable to take advantage of off-peak pricing, and even fewer will have the overnight option, Mr. Wright said, because of constraints in the marketplace and local regulations that restrict delivery hours.
The Staten Island borough president, Guy V. Molinari, said he was pleased with the port agency's decision to preserve a discount for drivers who regularly use the Staten Island crossings. That discounted toll, which is now $2, will rise to $2.50.
The agency had initially proposed eliminating the discount, which has existed since 1991. It applies to 22,000 commuters a day. 
One of the key questions that remained for many, including the Port Authority's executive director, Robert Boyle, was whether the congestion-pricing plan, the largest in the country, will alter driver habits and encourage E-ZPass enrollments with with a differential of only $2 between the cash toll and the off-peak E-ZPass price.
The increases were intended to finance an ambitious series of construction projects over the next five years, projects totaling $14 billion -- as much as the agency has spent on construction in its 80-year history. 
The plan would re-establish the agency as a master builder in the region, expanding ports, rebuilding airports and upgrading mass transit.
Critics of the agency, including the Giuliani administration, condemned what they said was a continuing imbalance in what is spent in New York, which has 70 percent of the region's population, and in New Jersey, which has 30 percent. They were particularly critical of what John Dyson, the mayor's chief economic adviser, called the agency's "continuing trend" to spend more on Newark International Airport than on either of New York's airports, La Guardia and Kennedy. Port Authority officials deny that charge.

HEADLINE: Argentina Off to Fast Start This Year 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
After years of desultory results, the Buenos Aires stock market has begun the year by soaring 26 percent, easily beating every other stock exchange in the world.
 The impressive spike has led some investors to say that Argentina might be poised to return to the days of the early 1990's when, with the government carrying out a sweeping privatization and deregulation program, the country was the darling of investors seeking emerging markets. 
 Other analysts caution that the rise in the main market indicator, the Merval index, could be just another speculative bubble -- there have been several here in the last decade -- that will burst unless the Argentine economy begins to grow quickly after shrinking for two years.
The total value of Argentine stocks has risen this year to $205 billion from $167 billion. The Merval index fell 5.69 points today, to 527.69. 
Prospects for stocks began to improve late last month after the International Monetary Fund and private banks approved a $39.7 billion financial package that eased fears that Argentina might default on its debts, release the peso from its peg to the American dollar, and spiral down a path of devaluation, rising inflation and corporate bankruptcy. 
Argentine stocks received another big lift when, in the United States, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point on Jan. 3. Lower interest rates up north usually translate into lower interest payments for Argentine government bonds. Every half-point drop in the United States, analysts say, means $350 million in annual savings for the Argentine government.
In a sign of renewed investor confidence in Argentina, the government sold $350 million in three-month treasury bills on Tuesday at a nominal annual interest of 6.75 percent -- the lowest rate in well over a year.
The stock market is also surging because of the stronger euro, since 25 percent of Argentina's commercial trade is with Europe. The euro's climb has produced what is effectively a 15 percent devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to Europe over the last two months. Meanwhile, a recent strengthening of the Brazilian economy and currency, and rising wheat, corn and soy prices promise to improve Argentina's exports this year, local economists say.
"The key issue for Argentina is growth, but the basis for growth is there," said Jorge Mariscal, chief investment strategist for Latin America at Goldman, Sachs. "The consumer has very little debt, companies are not very leveraged and banks are very liquid. You could see spending and lending pick up rapidly."
But so far, evidence of growth is spotty for an economy -- South America's second-largest -- that shrank 3.2 percent in 1999 in the wake of the Asian and Russian currency crises. Last year, it shrank again, by a fraction of a percent. 
"What is lacking fundamentally is real recovery in growth," said James Upton, Latin America equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "We forecast G.D.P. will grow only 1.5 percent this year. What that means is that at some point equity traders, who by nature are opportunistic, may very well take money off the table in Argentina and put it to work in Brazil."
Consumer and investor sentiment has been depressed in Argentina in the last six months, after a period of renewed hope and stock market gains at this time last year. President Fernando de la Rua took office just over a year ago, promising to bolster growth, but his tax-raising and budget-cutting policies had the opposite effect.
"Growth cannot come from one day to another," the economy minister, Jose Luis Machinea, acknowledged this week. "It will come when people have confidence they are not about to lose their job."
Unemployment remains stubbornly high at about 15 percent. But government officials predict that a decline in interest rates will translate into 2.5 percent growth this year, followed by sustained rates of 4 percent to 5 percent in coming years. 
But uncertainties remain, analysts say. One is the strength of the United States economy, since a recession would be likely to have a strong ripple effect across Latin America.
Another is the steadiness of the de la Rua government, a coalition whose weakness was highlighted by the resignation of Vice President Carlos Alvarez in October in a dispute over the handling of a Senate bribery scandal.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs; 
Bosnia, Sort Of

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: ZVORNIK, Bosnia 

 BODY:
What is the best way to sum up the situation in Bosnia today, five years after NATO came to its rescue? Very simple: Bosnia today is sort of a country -- it's sort of united, sort of divided, sort of peaceful, sort of corrupt, sort of coming back, sort of not coming back -- a place where NATO armies feel sort of good about what they've done to stabilize the country, but where NATO diplomats feel sort of bad that Bosnia's Serbs, Muslims and Croats still have not come together enough for the state to function on its own. 
 It's sort of like that. 
 This ambiguous reality is a perfect mirror of the ambivalent attitudes the NATO allies brought to the task of rescuing this country. That is, the allies were not so callous as to let Bosnia be formally partitioned between Serbia and Croatia. They cared enough eventually to move in 60,000 NATO troops to stop the fighting. But they did not care enough about the place to actually take over the government, throw out all the rotten nationalist politicians and rebuild Bosnia from the ground up so that by now it would be more than sort of a country. As such, change here is going to be painfully slow, and both NATO and America are going to have to be here for a long time. 
Lt. Col. Bruce Hain of the U.S. Army, who commands a U.S.-NATO unit near the border with Serbia, let me join him on a patrol through the largely Bosnian Serb town of Zvornik, where you can see exactly what has and has not changed here.
You see that a makeshift marketplace in the town center sits where one of Zvornik's three mosques once stood, before it was razed by the Serbs. But if you look up in the hills you see that thousands of Zvornik's Muslims have returned, with international aid and protection, and rebuilt their homes. But around the corner you also see apartments that used to belong to Zvornik Muslims but are now occupied by Serbian refugees from Sarajevo, who will have to be forcibly evicted if more Muslim refugees want to come home. Colonel Hain says that will not be easy. 
You see the Drina River flowing by full of garbage because Zvornik has no waste system, but you see that the road into town has been neatly plowed of snow, because NATO pays local Serbs to clear it, a symbol of how dependent the locals are on NATO. Unemployment here is 50 percent. You see that you can walk across the Drina bridge right into Yugoslavia and no one will stop you, because only 3 of Bosnia's 432 border crossings are manned, which is why this country has become the key portal for smuggling drugs and people into Europe, particularly Iranians and Chinese. Stopping that is not part of NATO's mission. Maybe it's the grim weather, but you see no one with a smile, not even kids.
Actually, the happiest people here are the 4,900 U.S. troops serving with NATO. "It's a great opportunity for someone like myself to lead people," explains Colonel Hain. "Everyone here feels that they're doing something important." This is not spin. You hear this from all U.S. troops: We're keeping the peace and getting experience in everything that an army does -- patrols, intelligence, transport, operations -- except killing people. It beats marching around a flagpole in Germany. It is no accident that the highest rate of re-enlistment in the U.S. Army today comes from troops in Bosnia and Kosovo.
That's no reason to stay here forever, but it is a reason not to rush away. The Bush team wants to turn Bosnia peacekeeping over to the Europeans. But without some U.S. troops on the ground, the Europeans won't stay here for long either. It's the U.S. troops who intimidate the bad guys in Bosnia, and it's U.S. leadership that makes NATO work. Period. 
Civil wars end in one of three ways, and Bosnia will be no different. Either they end like Lebanon, with a soft partition, a lot of mixing, but under an iron fist (Syria); or they end like Cyprus, with a hard partition and no mixing; or they end like the U.S. Civil War, with one side crushing the other and imposing its order. NATO will not allow a hard partition, but it has no desire to conquer and run the country properly itself. So Bosnia is going to have a soft partition, with a weak government and with, ideally, more mixing of people every year. But it will need NATO's iron fist in the background for years to achieve even that, and NATO will need America's help. If we're lucky, in 10 years Bosnia will be like Bulgaria. That's the future. Get used to it. Things could be worse. Sort of.

HEADLINE: Chiquita Sues Europeans, Citing Banana-Quota Losses 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
In the latest move in an escalating trade dispute, Chiquita Brands International sued the executive body of the European Union yesterday for $525 million in damages related to banana quotas that the company contends have pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy. 
 Chiquita, based in Cincinnati, which until now had relied on the United States government to fight for its market share in Europe, filed the lawsuit with the Court of First Instance of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. In the suit, Chiquita contended that unfair European trade barriers had cost it half its market in Europe and directly contributed to the financial difficulties that forced the company to suspend payment on its debts last week and begin a financial restructuring. 
 The $525 million the company is seeking from the commission represents "only a fraction of the damages" Chiquita has suffered because of the trade restrictions, said Robert W. Olson, a senior vice president and general counsel. 
Mr. Olson said that $525 million corresponded to lost profit and other harm that Chiquita has incurred only since Jan. 1, 1999, the date on which the most recent banana import system was put in place by the European Commission, the European Union's day-to-day executive. 
Chiquita contends that even though the 15 nations of the European Union have agreed to comply with World Trade Organization rulings that the restrictions are unfair, the new system, like the one it replaced, is illegal. In April 1999, the W.T.O. ruled that the new restrictions did not comply with international trade laws. 
Chiquita also warned the European Commission that it would seek further damages later this year if another new method of distributing import licenses on a first-come-first-served basis is enforced in April. Chiquita and United States trade officials have called that system unfair. 
In Brussels, Pascal Lamy, the European Union trade commissioner, declined to comment on the suit because it is before the Court of Justice. But the commission has rejected Chiquita's contention that the import system is the cause of its financial woes. Anthony Gooch, a spokesman, said, "If you try to compare the respective situations of Chiquita and the other banana companies that have to operate under similar conditions, it suggests that Chiquita's difficulties probably lie elsewhere."
The banana trade war has been going on since European nations in 1993 started favoring bananas imported from their former colonies in the Caribbean and Africa. The Europeans contended that without such help, small-scale banana growers would suffer. 
Chiquita had invested heavily to break into the European market a decade ago. After the trade barriers were erected, it turned to Washington for assistance. The company's chairman and chief executive, Carl H. Lindner, has made big contributions to both political parties. 
Chiquita's bananas are grown in Latin America, and are not United States products. But the Clinton administration took up the company's cause anyway and brought several complaints to the W.T.O. on Chiquita's behalf. They were decided in Chiquita's favor, but the Europeans delayed amending the import rules. 
The United States then imposed $191 million in punitive sanctions on a range of European goods including Italian pecorino cheese and British shortbread. Mr. Lamy has said that the European Union will challenge the American sanctions if they are not lifted when the new banana import rules take effect in April.
Craig Pouncey, a lawyer with the Brussels office of Herbert Smith, the firm representing Chiquita, said the European Commission has also been sued by five European companies involved in the banana trade that have been hurt by the quotas. He said trade-related suits are brought against the European Commission "very frequently." 
Mr. Gooch, the commission spokesman, said four European producers of goods that have been put on the United States sanctions list have sued the commission for damages indirectly caused by the banana rules. "Our position on these cases has been clear," Mr. Gooch said. "We do not believe they have any grounds for bringing these cases before the Court of Justice." 
Steven G. Warshaw, president and chief operating officer of Chiquita, said he did not expect the suit against the European Commission to be decided before the company completes the financial restructuring of its $862 million debt with corporate bondholders later this year. "This legal proceeding will extend beyond that," Mr. Warshaw said. "This is a subject we'll have to discuss with our bondholders."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Ad Bowl 2001 Will Be a Rout

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Warren G. Harding was never president during a Super Bowl. But his campaign promise of a "return to normalcy" could describe Super Sunday for Madison Avenue as the dot-com mania of 2000 gives way to a far more traditional advertiser lineup. 
Last year, as digital fever was cresting, 17 advertisers during the game were dot-coms, compared with 3 during the game in 1999; including Britannica
.com, Computer.com, Epidemic.com, Lifeminders.com, OurBeginning.com and Pets.com. Their frenzy to get a sales pitch before the biggest single viewing audience of the year even led some to pay $3 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, $800,000 more than the average price.
 01-26-01 
 That cyberstampede sent several mainstay Super Bowl advertisers like MasterCard to the sidelines to avoid the high cost, not to mention the hyperbolic atmosphere of so many newcomers all clamoring for attention at once.
Now, with dot-com hysteria as deflated as a football sat upon by Tony Siragusa of the Baltimore Ravens, the roster of Internet marketers has been pared to three, all Super Bowl veterans: the E*Trade Group, Hotjobs.com and the Monster.com division of TMP Worldwide.
As a result, most of the 30 marketers paying CBS an estimated average of $2.3 million for each 30-second time slot during Super Bowl XXXV on Sunday come from established categories like apparel, automobiles, films, financial services, packaged goods and soft drinks.
In 2001, "there are no 'flaky' clients," said Joseph Abruzzese, president for network sales at CBS, owned by Viacom, in New York. "They're all bona fide, real marketer clients." Among the blue-chip, not-com names: Anheuser-Busch, FedEx, the M&M/Mars division of Mars, the Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola units of PepsiCo, Visa, Volkswagen of America -- and MasterCard, back after its I year away.
"This is going to be a return to what the Super Bowl was," said Larry Flanagan, chief marketing officer at MasterCard International in Purchase, N.Y. "All the major advertisers back in place."
The result could be a less frenetic Ad Bowl than last year, when the agencies working for the dot-coms -- almost all fledglings desperate to be noticed amid a sea of competitors -- produced myriad commercials that grated and annoyed with bizarre plots or self-consciously madcap antics. For instance, spots for Computer.com and Lifeminders.com both assumed coy, faux-naif poses by pretending to be cheap home movies, while OurBeginning.com centered its commercial on a cat fight among angry brides.
"If you looked at a lot of the dot-com ads, they were wacky, but they didn't tie back to their brands," said Dawn Hudson, senior vice president for strategy and marketing at the Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo in Purchase.
"I wouldn't want to say that dot-coms were better than traditional or traditional were better than dot-coms," she added, "but we would like people to keep looking forward to the ads as well as the game."
That is an understatement, as Ms. Hudson is buying three minutes' worth of commercial time during the game for her flagship brand. The spots, by the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, will feature a new theme, "Joy of Pepsi," replacing the more generic "Joy of cola."
Last year, the ad lineup included "a lot of first-timers throwing money around," said Bob Lachky, vice president for brand management at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis. "The vast majority of them weren't very memorable."
"Now, you've got a lot of major advertisers coming back, people with more experience on branding," he added. "It is a more challenging year for us, very competitive."
Anheuser-Busch will run commercials in every quarter for Budweiser and Bud Light beers as well as a spot about under-age drinking featuring the boy band 'N Sync. The spots are from two other Omnicom units, the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide and Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco.
As if to underscore the drastic difference between Super Bowl XXXIV and XXXV, 4Sure.com, a direct marketer in Trumbull, Conn., announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the assets of Computer.com, which closed in November. The subject line of an e-mail message delivering a news release about the deal read: "4Sure.com acquires last year's big Super Bowl ad spender."
Yet even though the dot-com presence has diminished so markedly, the Internet is now a more intrinsic part of the game plans of all advertisers, whether their technology is high or low.
For example, Anheuser-Busch had promotions on two of its own Web sites, BudBowl.com and Budweiser.com, and on a CBS site, SportsLine.com. MasterCard will be the sponsor of "the biggest online travel program we've ever done," Mr. Flanagan said, "live on our Web site on Super Bowl Sunday." And Pepsi-Cola joined Yahoo in sponsoring an online poll at pepsi.yahoo.com in which computer users can vote for their favorite Pepsi Super Bowl spots.
"You'll see more interaction," Ms. Hudson said. "It's a wave of the future."
"The number of rooms with both television and computers on at the same time is surprisingly high," she added. "That enables us to have a one-to-one dialogue with somebody while doing something broad-based on TV."
Nonadvertisers are seeking to ride the coattails of the companies willing to spend the most money ever for commercial time to reach what is likely to be the largest audience by far for any TV show this year. Among those conducting ad polls during and after the game or putting up game spots on their sites are Ecreativesearch.com, Eisner Communications, Greenfield Online, NTN Communications and USA Today, the latter for a special, "Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials," to be shown by CBS tomorrow night.
"We wanted to have an interactive component to have the fans involved," said Bob Horowitz, senior vice president for programming at the Trans World International unit of the International Management Group in New York, which is producing the show with the National Football League.
Given the dot-com disappearing act, how do the few actually advertising in the game feel?
"The Super Bowl has become a crucial component of our strategy," said Jeff Taylor, chief executive at Monster.com in Maynard, Mass., the job search Web site that is running Super Bowl spots for the third consecutive year. "We made the decision to come back the day after last year's."
"People watch the advertising like a show, so it's the only time the whole year your ads are content," he added. "And January marks a huge surge in job hunting; last Tuesday we set a record with 38,100 resumes posted on our site. The Super Bowl kicks in another additional surge; we doubled our traffic the day after the Super Bowl last year."
Monster.com will run two commercials from its new agency, Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas Advertising.
Hotjobs.com in New York, which competes against Monster, is also back for the third consecutive year, this time with a commercial by Weiss Stagliano Partners in New York. Richard Johnson, chief executive at Hotjobs, said that traffic to www.hotjobs.com, its Web site, soared 450 percent after the 2000 Super Bowl, and resume submissions climbed 750 percent.
The largest dot-com advertiser, E*Trade, is back again not only with commercials during the game but also as the sponsor of the halftime show.
"It's a very different marketing environment this year," said Michael Sievert, chief marketing officer at E*Trade in Menlo Park, Calif. "It's an investment that works best for leading brands, brands that have something to say."
What E*Trade has to say, according to Mr. Sievert, is to describe "how we've evolved from a trading company to a fully integrated financial services company." That is why the company's commercials, by Goodby, Silverstein, will promote its banking and retirement planning services as well as its stock trading service.
Another sign of how the Super Bowl ad landscape has returned to normalcy is the lessening of the frantic demand for commercial time compared with last year, when the dot-coms bid up prices.
The softening economy has even led to widespread speculation in trade publications that CBS had trouble maintaining the $2.3 million average price for each 30 seconds of commercial time in selling the 30 minutes of spots that will appear during the three-hour game.
"There was such a huge hole from the dot-coms, everyone said, 'They'll never fill it; I'll buy at the last minute,' " Mr. Abruzzese said. "But we saw this coming months ago, and we had a good strategy to sell it for what it was worth."
"We beat our estimates, and that's all that really matters," he added.
CBS will take in $155 million from selling time before, during and after the game, Mr. Abruzzese said. The previous record, $130 million, was set by the network broadcasting the game last year, the ABC unit of the Walt Disney Company.
Add the $50 million in ad revenue coming in on Sunday at the local stations CBS owns around the country, and the payday exceeds $200 million.
Is that enough to satisfy Mel Karmazin, the president and chief operating officer at Viacom, who is renowned for his close scrutiny of ad revenue?
"I am very happy; I am extremely happy," Mr. Abruzzese said, adding with a laugh, "Mel is probably, too, but he would never say that."

HEADLINE: At Qualcomm, Earnings Beat Forecast by 1 cents 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Qualcomm, the developer of wireless communications technology, posted first-quarter earnings today that beat Wall Street estimates. And it said it agreed with profit forecasts for the year.
 The company, which is based in San Diego, reported earnings of $231.6 million, or 29 cents a share, versus $209.6 million, or 27 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 The results topped Wall Street's forecast of 28 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Qualcomm reported revenue of $684 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, down 10 percent from the period a year ago. Including one-time items, the company posted a net loss of $228.7 million, or 31 cents a share, for the quarter, in contrast to a net profit of $177 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Reported revenue fell to $684 million from $1.1 billion.
Qualcomm shares fell 31 cents, to $73.94, in Nasdaq trading before the announcement. The stock jumped 3 percent, to $76.31 a share, in after-hours trading on Instinet.
Qualcomm's chairman and chief executive, Irwin M. Jacobs, said demand was strong and still growing for the company's code division multiple access (CDMA) technology, Qualcomm's proprietary wireless technology that competes with two other global standards.
"Our technology licensing and semiconductor businesses are benefiting from strong demand for CDMA technology and products," Mr. Jacobs said in a statement.
Qualcomm said it was comfortable with current analyst estimates for second-quarter earnings of 29 cents a share, as well as full-year 2001 estimates of $1.27 a share.
In the first quarter, Qualcomm's satellite business was hit by economic and capital market conditions, as well as a recent decision by the satellite telephone company Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd. to suspend payments on its debt as it looked at restructuring options.
On Jan. 16, Globalstar said it had indefinitely suspended payments on all its debt, meaning it did not make a principal and interest payment of about $22 million to Qualcomm the day before.
Qualcomm recorded $595 million in charges relating to reserves against certain Globalstar-related assets.

HEADLINE: IN POLICY CHANGE, GREENSPAN BACKS A BROAD TAX CUT 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave his blessing today to a substantial tax cut, but warned that it should not be so big that it would plunge the government back into deficit if the federal budget surplus fails to materialize as projected.
 In a clear shift from his previous position that reducing the national debt should be the focus of fiscal policy, Mr. Greenspan said improvements in the economy's long-term potential and the swelling surplus projections had "reshaped the choices and opportunities before us" to permit a combination of debt reduction and tax cuts. 
 Mr. Greenspan also provided his first public assessment of the state of the economy since the Fed cut interest rates at the beginning of the month to help keep the precipitous slowdown from becoming a recession. 
He said the economy had all but stopped growing, leading some analysts to conclude that the central bank is likely to cut rates by another half a percentage point at its meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday.
"As far as we can judge, we have had a very dramatic slowing down, and indeed we are probably very close to zero at this particular moment," Mr. Greenspan said. 
As his stature has grown in Washington and around the world, Mr. Greenspan has increasingly exerted influence on issues outside of the central bank's responsibility for setting interest rates. His statement on taxes, in testimony to the Senate Budget Committee, was reminiscent of his support in early 1993 of President Bill Clinton's first big economic initiative -- his proposal to bring what was then a huge federal budget deficit under control.
Just as his hedged backing of Mr. Clinton's plan provided invaluable political cover to Democrats then as they voted to raise taxes, his guarded endorsement of a tax cut today gave new impetus to the effort by Republicans to push through the biggest tax reduction since the Reagan administration.
His comments were especially pleasing to the White House, which has made President Bush's proposal for a $1.6 trillion tax cut over the next decade the centerpiece of its economic agenda.
Speaking to reporters at the White House this evening, Mr. Bush said Mr. Greenspan's statements were "measured and just right," and that the Fed chairman recognized "that we need good monetary policy and sound fiscal policy to make sure the economy grows."
Democrats cited Mr. Greenspan's focus on fiscal discipline as justification to keep any tax cut much smaller than what Mr. Bush has been seeking. But Democrats were clearly disheartened that Mr. Greenspan, who until now had provided them with one of their most effective arguments against sweeping tax cuts, had changed his tune.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, said he had always viewed Mr. Greenspan as the anchor of efforts for fiscal responsibility.
"I believe that you were right then, and I am somewhat stunned by the fact that the anchor seems to be wavering today," Mr. Byrd said. 
As he always does, Mr. Greenspan, who is less than a year into his fourth four-year term as head of the central bank, told members of both parties at least some of what they wanted to hear. He said he was a supporter of across-the-board reductions in income tax rates, the provision at the heart of Mr. Bush's plan.
But Mr. Greenspan passed up an opportunity to endorse Mr. Bush's proposal specifically. And while he did not say how big a tax reduction would be appropriate, he suggested that he was sympathetic to the concern expressed by many Democrats that a stampede to cut taxes could come back to haunt the nation if the surplus falls short of expectations.
Surplus projections are little more than educated guesswork, he said, and Congress should view them with some skepticism, at least until economists have a better understanding of why the economy has been generating far more tax revenue than expected in recent years. Analysts have been grappling in particular with how much of the surge in tax revenue came from the run-up in stock prices in the late 1990's and what would happen if the market remained flat or fell in coming years.
"With today's euphoria surrounding the surpluses, it is not difficult to imagine the hard-earned fiscal restraint developed in recent years rapidly dissipating," Mr. Greenspan said. "We need to resist those policies that could readily resurrect the deficits of the past and the fiscal imbalances that followed in their wake."
Mr. Greenspan also undercut one of Mr. Bush's main arguments for cutting taxes now, that doing so would help counteract the current economic slowdown. Fiscal policy, he said, moves too slowly to deal effectively with the ups and downs of the business cycle, especially in a period in which the economy seems to be adjusting to changing circumstances with exceptional speed.
He said a tax cut could "do noticeable good" in the unlikely event of a long-lasting economic downturn. 
But he suggested that any tax reduction be tied to continued progress in reducing the debt on the schedule currently contemplated by both parties. If the surplus rolls in as anticipated, the entire $3.4 trillion in national debt held by the public could be paid off by the end of this decade or shortly thereafter.
Any plan for using the surplus "could include provisions that, in some way, would limit surplus-reducing actions if specified targets for the budget surplus and federal debt were not satisfied," he said.
"Only if the probability was very low that prospective tax cuts or new outlay initiatives would send the on-budget accounts into deficit would unconditional initiatives appear prudent."
Republicans have not seriously considered any plan under which tax cuts would be linked to progress in debt reduction, and it is unclear whether Mr. Greenspan's suggestion had any chance of being adopted.
Democrats said the roughly $3 trillion in surpluses expected over the next decade outside the Social Security system would not be enough to cover a tax cut of the scale envisioned by Mr. Bush. They said that once other needs are accounted for, like increased military spending and adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare, Mr. Bush's plan would send the government into deficit.
But Republicans said the surplus provided more than enough room for a tax cut and other needs. Jill Kozeny, a spokeswoman for Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican from Iowa who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Mr. Greenspan's testimony had convinced Mr. Grassley that a tax cut the size of Mr. Bush's "is doable and that it's important to do it."
Mr. Grassley had previously suggested that it would be difficult to get a tax cut of more than about $1 trillion through the Senate, which is divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Mr. Greenspan denied that he had flip-flopped on his support for tax cuts. He said that until now, it was not at all clear that the government had a real chance at eliminating the debt held by the public within a decade.
But improvements in the most basic measure of economic potential -- productivity, or output per hour -- have substantially brightened the economy's long-term prospects, even at a time when the economy is enduring a short-term downturn, he said.
As a result, he said, there is a greater likelihood that the government will run surpluses for years to come -- and that the government will soon confront the welcome but tricky question of what to do with surplus revenue when the debt is zero.
Lacking anything else to do with the money, Mr. Greenspan said, the government might eventually end up buying stocks and corporate bonds on Wall Street, involving Washington heavily in private enterprise.
To avoid that outcome, he said, the government should act now to put fiscal policy on a "glide path" that pays off the debt and leaves little or nothing in the way of additional surpluses once the debt reaches zero.
The trade-off between debt reduction and other uses of the surplus "appears no longer an issue," Mr. Greenspan said.
Budget policy should strive to make the surplus outside of the Social Security system "economically inconsequential when the debt is effectively paid off," and it is "far better, in my judgment, that the surpluses be lowered by tax reductions than by spending increases," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan did not address the current state of the economy in his prepared testimony, but answered questions about it from members of both parties.
Growth in the fourth quarter of last year "was a very small positive," he said. The most notable aspect of the slowdown, he said, is that businesses are responding to the deterioration in the outlook by reducing their inventories of unsold goods and supplies before ordering any more.
Whether the economy sinks into recession, he added, will be largely dependent on how consumer confidence holds up.
He said there was also some risk to the national economy if the power crisis in California were not resolved. And he noted that higher energy costs in general had acted as a brake on growth.
"We're in a period where we are observing the beginnings of what is probably a major inventory correction," he said. "The critical issue we need to address is whether that degree of contraction is enough to breach the fabric of consumer confidence. At the moment, it has not. Indeed, we do not yet see the actual immediate implications of what recessions look like, but we won't know how this all works out for a while."
Mr. Greenspan said that investments in technology allowed companies to respond to fluctuations in demand for their products, and to their need for supplies and raw materials, more quickly and with greater accuracy than ever before. As a result, he said, the inventory adjustment may take place much more rapidly than in past cycles.
Investors have been debating for the last several weeks whether the Fed would cut interest rates by another half a percentage point next week, or hold the rate cut to a quarter of a percentage point. The Fed cut its benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks to 6 percent from 6.5 percent on Jan. 3.
Analysts said Mr. Greenspan's testimony suggested that the Fed was more likely to cut rates by half a point next week. They said the chances for a half-point cut were bolstered by the government's report today that employment costs increased in the last three months of 2000 at a slower-than-expected pace.

HEADLINE: Once a Critic, Giuliani Turns Benefactor, With $1.2 Billion for Arts Projects 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
With classic Giuliani-esque swagger, the mayor who launched an infamous assault on the Brooklyn Museum of Art asserted last month that he had done more to support the city's great cultural institutions than any other City Hall occupant of the last half century. Yesterday, Rudolph W. Giuliani provided hard numbers to turn that claim into fact -- and change the image of a mayor known more for his desire to build baseball stadiums than opera houses.
 In a financial plan presented to a packed crowd in the City Hall Public Hearing Chamber, Mr. Giuliani proposed that the city spend a record $1.2 billion over the next 10 years on expanding or rebuilding Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Jewish Heritage, the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the New York Aquarium, among other institutions. Cultural leaders, who had been generally aware of the mayor's proposals, were nonetheless taken aback by the extent of the riches. 
 No other mayor, they said, had ever given them so much. Mr. Giuliani, once a scourge in the city's salons for trying to shut down the Brooklyn Museum over an exhibit he termed "sick stuff," was now a hero.
"This is what happens to all good mayors," said Gordon J. Davis, the president of Lincoln Center, which is to receive $240 million from the city over the next decade. "All good mayors learn how the arts are so intertwined in the identity of New York City. Even if they don't appreciate the art, they come to appreciate the power of those institutions -- the power of ideas, the power of the art they're creating, the economic power, the political power."
What caused the change in Mr. Giuliani, who also happens to be an ardent opera fan? And why now, when the term-limited mayor has only 11 months left in office?
First, many of the city's cultural leaders said, the mayor is hurriedly trying to erect an attainable physical legacy after two terms largely free of splashy new edifices. "This is a mayor who until now has not shown a tremendous interest in building monuments," said Randall Bourscheidt, the president of the Alliance for the Arts, an advocacy group. "And I think that approaching the end of his term, and no doubt because of some of the other reflections that have been prompted by his health, he is probably thinking in the long-term. And nothing is more long-term than building a museum or a library or a botanical garden. These are the things that survive all the changes that this city is known for."
Second, the leaders said, the mayor has seized on a prosperity-fueled renaissance in cultural building that has not occurred in the city since the last quarter of the 19th century. "You couldn't have invented this, even if he had wanted to," Mr. Bourscheidt said. "The timing is perfect because of the long period of prosperity, but also because of a period of great civic optimism." Yesterday, for example, Mr. Giuliani pointed out that the city's $240 million for Lincoln Center is to be used to help attract private donations to what is estimated to be a $1.5 billion redevelopment project.
Third, the mayor has said himself that he has come to see spending on cultural institutions as an investment in one of the city's booming businesses in a post-industrial New York -- a view he expressed as far back as 1993, before there was much city money for him to spend. 
"If we looked at it that way, and if the mayor talked to the people of the city that way, it would be much easier to invest in cultural institutions and not create the feeling that you're being a dilettante," Mr. Giuliani said at the end of last year. "What I observed happening in the city for 30 years, as a resident and a citizen, is that whenever there were difficulties in the budget, mayors would pull money out of the cultural institutions on the theory of 'How can you spend money on music, how can you spend money on dance, how can you spend money on painting, how can you spend money on these things when people are starving?' And the reality is that by spending money on all those things, many fewer people starve. Because that's the way you develop an economy in a capitalist country," he had said.
Fourth, the cultural leaders said, Mr. Giuliani was engaging in the pleasant task of spending hundreds of millions of dollars in the budgets of future mayors, who will bear the expenses when he office next year. Although nothing legally binds a future mayor to spending money committed in the city's 10-year capital budget, cutting such funds would be politically costly.
Finally, cultural leaders pointed out that members of the City Council, who have approved or in some cases increased the mayor's proposed spending on cultural projects, were as much heroes as Mr. Giuliani. City Council members also pointed out yesterday that the mayor had once again cut the operating budgets of the cultural institutions, an annual budget negotiating tactic that Mr. Giuliani uses to keep overall city spending in line.
It also helps, budget analysts independent of City Hall said, to keep the mayor's spending on culture in perspective. The record $1.2 billion represents less than 2 per cent of the city's 10-year capital budget, which is made up largely of spending on schools, bridges, road, highways and sanitation.
Put another way, the eye-popping $240 million over 10 years for one of the city's cultural jewels, Lincoln Center, still does not match the $302 million proposed over the same time period to replace the Willis Avenue Bridge.

 Greenspan Lends Support To a Substantial Tax Cut
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave his blessing to a substantial tax cut but warned that it should not be so big that it would plunge the government back into deficit if the federal budget surplus fails to materialize as projected.
 Mr. Greenspan, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, also provided his first public assessment of the state of the economy since the Fed reduced interest rates on Jan. 3, saying the economy has all but stopped growing. That led some analysts to conclude that the central bank is likely to cut rates by another half a percentage point at its meeting next week. Page A1. 

Neighbors Point Finger at California
Public officials in Western states have ominous political problems like soaring electricity rates and deregulation plans in turmoil. But those leaders, at least for now, have a convenient one-word explanation for the debacles and a place to point the blame: California. A1.

Some of New York City's most powerful economic interest groups said that they feared the city could face an energy crisis as early as this summer and urged that new electricity supplies be installed as quickly as possible. B2.

Chiquita Sues European Agency
In the latest move in an escalating trade dispute, Chiquita Brands International sued the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, for $525 million in damages related to banana quotas that the company contends have pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy. Chiquita, led by Carl H. Lindner, contends that unfair trade barriers have cost it half its market in Europe and directly contributed to the financial difficulties that forced the company to suspend payment on its debts last week and begin a restructuring. C5.

Dow Edges Up, but Nasdaq Falls
The stock market reacted cautiously to remarks made by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.55 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,729.52. But the rally was confined to blue-chip stocks, as technology issues declined. The Nasdaq composite index fell 104.87 points, or 3.7 percent, to 2,754.28. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.79 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,357.51. C5.

Scientists Map Genome of Rice
Two companies are expected to announce that they have determined the sequence of the genome of rice, the first commercially important crop to have its genetic code unraveled. C5.

Double-Digit Gains for Drug Makers
American Home Products posted a fourth-quarter loss after a charge that was higher than expected for diet pill litigation. Two rivals, Eli Lilly and Schering-Plough, said profits rose as they sold more drugs that are meant to have fewer side effects. American Home's income rose 17 percent before the charge. Eli Lilly's profit rose 14 percent, and Schering-Plough's gained 13 percent. Shares of American Home climbed $2.89, to $57.64, while Eli Lilly advanced 31 cents, to $83.06, and Schering-Plough rose $1.69, to $53.63. C5.

Bidder Chosen for Japanese Bank
After an intense round of bidding, Japanese financial regulators have chosen the Lone Star Group, a private equity fund group based in Texas, to take over the bankrupt Tokyo Sowa Bank, because its bid for the bank would require the least amount of public money to clear away bad loans. World Business, Section W.

HEADLINE: Choosing Hunter College President Puts CUNY Trustees in Tug-of-War 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The selection of the next president of Hunter College on Manhattan's East Side is the subject of a fierce power struggle, with Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani lobbying trustees of the City University of New York to choose Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, and the university's chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, jockeying for a proven manager of a large complex organization. 
 Ms. Raab, who was issues director for Mr. Giuliani's 1989 mayoral campaign, is pressing hard for the position, and aides to Mr. Giuliani and Governor Pataki have talked to many of the trustees about supporting her, according to trustees who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 Randy M. Mastro, a former deputy mayor under Mr. Giuliani who is one of the trustees who supports Ms. Raab, said she would bring special skills to the job.
"Jennifer Raab is obviously a person of extraordinary ability, leadership and accomplishment," he said, noting that he had worked closely with her. 
He predicted that with her wide contacts in the city, she would have "an immediate positive impact on fund-raising and attracting private sector energy and talent."
Dr. Goldstein however, is said to want someone with more managerial, academic and fund-raising experience for Hunter, which has 20,000 students and is CUNY's most populous college. He has told trustees that he favors Jo Ann M. Gora, the provost of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., a Vassar graduate with a doctorate in sociology from Rutgers. He said he felt that she had demonstrated the capacity to manage a large, complex organization, to raise money and to understand the culture and problems of higher education.
Located on East 68th Street and Park Avenue, Hunter is highly visible and is one of CUNY's most popular campuses. Former Hunter presidents include Donna E. Shalala, who served as Bill Clinton's secretary of health and human services, and Paul LeClerc, the president of the New York Public Library. 
Some of the trustees who back the chancellor's candidate say that their efforts to improve the university and its image will be set back by a presidential appointment that they say is politically motivated. They added that such an appointment could impede their ability to attract strong candidates for the presidencies of two of its other flagship campuses, City College and Queens College.
But other trustees, who support Ms. Raab's candidacy, say that CUNY will look best if it chooses the strongest person, and that it is appropriate for the governor and the mayor to express their perspectives both on policy issues and personnel decisions. 
Most of the trustees on both sides would only talk on the condition that they not be quoted directly. Herman Badillo, the chairman of the board of trustees, Dr. Goldstein and Ms. Raab all declined requests to be interviewed about the selection process.
Yesterday, Hunter students and faculty leaders sent a joint letter to the trustees, calling on them "to ignore external forces that can intrude on the collaborative and unambiguous results of the presidential search."
The letter was signed by Hunter's student government leaders, the chairwoman of the Hunter College Senate, the president of the Faculty Delegate Assembly and the three Hunter professors who sat on the trustees' search committee.
The mayor appoints 5 of the 17 trustees and the governor 10. (The remaining board seats are held by a student who votes on appointments and a faculty member who does not.) 
Mr. Giuliani's office did not respond two requests for comment Wednesday and yesterday. Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the governor, would only say, "The governor has every confidence that the trustees have conducted a proper and thorough search that will produce the best qualified candidate."
Ms. Raab was one of four finalists that the board's search committee forwarded to Dr. Goldstein, but she had less support than the two leading candidates, one of whom was Dr. Gora.
Ms. Raab, who holds degrees from Cornell University, Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and Harvard's law school, has served since 1994 as chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, an agency with 60 employees, a $3 million budget and wide reach throughout the city. 
During a meeting with Hunter College students, faculty and staff in December, she noted that she had graduated from Hunter College High School and believed strongly in public service and in public education. She added that her training as a lawyer helped her be a strong advocate and pointed to others, like Ellen V. Futter, the former president of Barnard, who had become college presidents without having risen up through academe.
CUNY officials said yesterday that Dr. Goldstein had been impressed with Ms. Raab and confirmed a report by the cable news channel station NY1 that he had offered her a job as president of a new economic development agency for CUNY.

HEADLINE: New Spending And Tax Cuts In '02 Budget 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, in his final budget plan, offered city residents a crowd-pleasing smorgasbord yesterday, with funds for new museums, low-cost housing and an extended school week and a sprinkling of new tax cuts on top.
 But the budget plan, while acknowledging that the city economy is cooling, leaves many of the bills for these offerings for his successor to handle. 
 A $39.32 billion plan for the coming fiscal year contains few surprises since the mayor outlined most of the new initiatives in his speech on the state of the city earlier this month. There is $103 million in new money to offer weekend science and English-language classes, as well as an expanded summer school program and mini-libraries in 21,000 classrooms, among other school initiatives.
And there is an extra $110 million for police programs intended to improve officer morale, track down suspects with outstanding warrants and combat the city's drug trade, among new crime-fighting efforts. 
A $405 million package of tax cuts the mayor is offering for 2002, climbing to $1.02 billion by 2004, has been proposed before but failed to win approval from the State Legislature. The package includes the elimination of a $2-a-night tax on hotel rooms, the creation of a city tax credit for the working poor, a series of reductions in levies paid by city businesses and the elimination of the city sales tax on clothing and shoes.
Mr. Giuliani, who used the opportunity during his hourlong budget presentation yesterday at City Hall to once again review the highlights of his seven years in office, said the city could afford to supplement spending in targeted areas while cutting taxes because of the years of able management by his administration and the City Council.
"The city has room to make choices," Mr. Giuliani said. "We have done the difficult job and continue to do it, more modestly now, of reducing the size of our spending, or trying to keep it under control." He used a laser pointer to run through dozens of budget charts, some of which had so many numbers that the mayor joked that the city officials and reporters packed into the old Board of Estimate chamber in City Hall would need the eyesight of Air Force pilots to read them.
His plan drew mixed reviews from the candidates vying to replace him, as well as the budget watchdogs who paged through the four volumes of spending data for the next four years and construction plans for the next decade.
"It is a major step in the right direction," said the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Democratic candidate for mayor. "It also has some pretty deep potholes in it."
The part of the 2002 city budget paid for by local taxpayers, according to the mayor's calculation, would drop by two-tenths of 1 percent. But once adjustments are made to reflect the city's prepayment of some of next year's debt with this year's expected $2.26 billion surplus, there would actually be inflation-adjusted growth of half of 1 percent, according to the city's Independent Budget Office.
The single biggest piece of the overall budget, as always, would go to the school system, a total of $12.19 billion, once pension and debt costs are included. That is less than 1 percent more than in the current year, but still a record. 
The mayor balances the budget for fiscal 2002, which begins July 1, with a Wall Street profit forecast that, despite hints of an economic slowdown and a sluggish stock market, is slightly more optimistic than it was at this time last year. 
And Mr. Giuliani's plan to spend $51.9 billion on new schools, rebuilt bridges, new museums and hundreds of other projects over the next decade would mean that 18.75 cents of each city tax dollar collected by 2004 would have to go to repay debt, up from 12 cents in 1990. 
The 10-year capital plan includes $13.4 billion for schools, translating into 13 new schools in the 2002 fiscal year, or 20,000 new classroom seats. The plan for the first time also includes $68 million for the new Guggenheim museum in Lower Manhattan and an extra $200 million a year for low-cost housing.
Mr. Vallone said he welcomed the tax cut plan since many of the specific items were reductions he first proposed. But the mayor's plan projects deficits in the next four years that cumulatively are a third larger than he predicted a year ago, totaling $7.18 billion. 
"Yes, taxes are too high in New York," said the public advocate, Mark Green, another Democratic candidate for mayor. "But with hard economic times looming, the city needs a more modest and targeted tax cut plan that doesn't leave the next mayor with a large deficit."
Mr. Vallone and other Council members also chided the mayor for once again including proposed spending cuts in city agencies -- from libraries, to parks, to museums and health and welfare programs -- that the Council has convinced him to restore in past years.
"It is just a waste of good time, essential time that we could spend on other things," said Councilman Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, of the detailed program cuts, which totaled $700 million. "These are good programs. It should not happen."
The mayor and his budget director, Adam L. Barsky, dismissed suggestions that the budget would leave the city in a financial bind for the next mayor. In fact, the mayor said, "It makes the fiscal condition of the city a lot more stable today than it has been since, I guess, before the fiscal crisis" of the 1970's.
Mr. Giuliani's revenue projections, while somewhat less conservative than last year's, are still extremely sober, City Council officials said, estimating, for example, that Wall Street would earn $7.2 billion in profits in the 2002 calendar year, compared with the estimated $19.5 billion in 2000. A year ago, the mayor estimated 2002 Wall Street profits at $5.3 billion.
The mayor attributed much of the projected future deficits to the state government, which in 1999 eliminated a commuter tax paid by suburbanites who work in the city and last year sweetened pension benefits for retired city employees. Those and other changes by the state will cost the city $853 million in 2002. And, the mayor added, the tax cuts can always be scaled back in the future if there are problems.
One of the biggest unknowns is the cost of settling contracts with the unions representing about 200,000 city employees. The mayor has about $800 million in the budget to provide about a 2.5 percent raise for most city workers, although he wants this money to be given out on the basis of merit.
But if the raises reach 5 percent -- about the level granted in the last year of the expired contracts -- the city would have to find $728 million more in 2002, according to the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit budget group. Furthermore, the four-year spending plan does not include money for raises in the final two years.
"We do want to settle," Mr. Giuliani said. "We do want to give them a pay raise. We are anxious to do that. But we can't do it at an irresponsible level."

Soaring electricity rates. Record-low reservoir levels at some big dams, which could imperil migrating salmon this spring. Deregulation plans in turmoil. A crash conservation program being urged on consumers and businesses. A dispute over whether to resume a long-abandoned nuclear power project.
 For public officials in California's neighboring states and elsewhere in the West, these sound like ominous political problems. And they certainly are, except that those leaders, at least for now, have a convenient one-word explanation for the debacles and a place to blame: California. 
 "California made their mess and we're paying for it," said Ken Rust, the chief financial manager for Portland, Ore. Utah's governor, Michael O. Leavitt, blamed California's "disastrous deregulation scheme" for an 11 percent increase in electricity rates that a major utility is proposing in his state. 
"Consumers in other Western states are left to pick up the tab," Governor Leavitt said. An editorial cartoon in The Salt Lake Tribune shows California plugging into an electrical outlet in snowy Utah to run a hot tub to the south.
Criticism of California, long popular in the West, has reached a crescendo in recent days as that state's electricity woes continue to mount, forcing rolling blackouts and threatening its largest utilities with bankruptcy. Far from expressing much sympathy, many people outside of California say that state has brought a huge problem on itself and, increasingly, on the entire region.
There is truth in this finger-pointing, but it hardly tells the whole story. While California is desperately seeking electricity during a season in which it normally exports electricity to the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountain states, there are plenty of other reasons for the rising rates here.
Natural-gas prices are soaring throughout the nation, and reservoir levels for the mammoth hydroelectric projects in the Northwest are low mainly because the region's rainfall in the past few months has been among the least in decades.
John Savage, Oregon's energy director, acknowledged this factor in testimony before the State Legislature's House Committee on Smart Growth and Commerce on Wednesday when he said, "Our hope is for 75-degree weather and rain of biblical proportions for the rest of the winter." 
And even as California gets blamed for failing to build any major power plants in a decade as its population grew by four million and itseconomy boomed, many other Western states do not have a much better record of increasing generation of electricity in the face of burgeoning populations.
"First and foremost, there is a shortage of megawatts," said Lawrence J. Makovich, senior director of power research for Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., referring to problems throughout the Western states. "There simply isn't enough generating capacity attached to the grid to meet the demand. The second problem is that when shortages hit, prices go through the roof."
Montana, the nation's fourth-largest energy-producing state on a per-capita basis, is one Western state that no longer has huge surpluses. Until recently, it exported 40 percent of the energy it produced. But over the last decade, the state population has grown nearly 13 percent, and state lawmakers are considering loosening environmental regulations to make it easier and faster to build new power plants.
Still, people in other states say California is failing to hold up its end of a long-running bargain, even as its governor, Gray Davis, blamed "out-of-state profiteers" for driving up the price of electricity and pushing the state to the brink of crisis. Neighboring states are angry about California's demands for power.
"It was a very complementary system," said Jacques P. Lawarree, an economics professor at the University of Washington and an expert on deregulation. "California sends power in the winter, when it's most needed here, and in the summer we send back power. It's always been a very good thing.
"Now that they have a problem and cannot do their part, we in the Northwest are suffering for that," Mr. Lawarree said, "and there are some who wish we could cut off California entirely from the grid. But it's also clear that we've benefited for many, many years."
Indeed, like it or not, there is recognition that the Western states will remain tied together on the power grid that sends huge amounts of electricity across the region, and that more cooperation, not less, is needed between California and other states. The Western Governors' Association, a nonpartisan group, is scheduled to meet in Portland next week with federal regulators and the new energy secretary, Spencer Abraham.
"It's very important that this doesn't deteriorate into a Northwest versus California thing," Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon said before a meeting with Gov. Gary Locke of Washington and Governor Davis of California in Sacramento earlier this month. (All three are Democrats.)
"We're all in this together," added Governor Kitzhaber who, with Governor Locke, has urged home owners, businesses and state agencies to find ways to cut electricity consumption by at least 10 percent. "We cannot afford to let California go down the tubes."
Still, as Mr. Rust, the director of Portland's bureau of financial management, put it, the federal mandates compelling the Northwest's generators to send power to California have aggravated the often "tenuous relationship" between his state and its much larger neighbor to the south.
As federal reservoirs have been drawn down to generate more power during this emergency, Mr. Rust said, the odds are being driven up that more young salmon will die this spring because river flows will not be adequate to get them downstream. The region, under the Endangered Species Act and a plethora of lawsuits, has spent billions of dollars on plans to save the fish.
"This is a huge issue in the Northwest, and it seems like it's barely getting factored into the discussion right now," Mr. Rust said in a telephone interview. "The concern is that with this requirement to send power to California, all the concerns about protecting the stream flow, the salmon habitat, all the money that's been spent to protect those fish, it all could get thrown out the window in an instant." 
Officials at the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency that sells power from a network of two dozen dams in the Northwest, said that low reservoirs are, indeed, danger signs, but are the result of the weather more than of the demands that the California crisis has placed on the system. The fate of the fish this spring will depend a great deal on the amount of rain and snow in the coming months and on the rate at which the winter snowpack melts into the region rivers.
But senators from Washington and Oregon have pleaded with federal regulators to stop an order requiring Bonneville electricity to go to California, so far to no avail. President Bush recently extended that order until early February but said it would not be continued after then.
"Frankly, I think my state is being set up -- and I include Washington State -- to be an energy farm for California," Senator Gordon H. Smith, an Oregon Republican, complained last week. He said he had received calls from several business executives in his state who said electricity rates for their companies had gone up between 30 percent and 40 percent, and they blamed California's demands. 
Meanwhile, while no other Western state is as far along with deregulation as California is, the recent woes seem to be putting the brakes on any movement toward deregulating. Several Oregon officials, including Mayor Vera Katz of Portland, have called for postponing a limited deregulation plan in that state. 
And earlier this week, Gov. Kenny Guinn of Nevada, said in his State of the State speech that he would delay a plan there that had been set to begin this fall.
"I cannot and will not support deregulation until I am assured that power supplies are secure," Governor Guinn, a Republican, said.
The recent problems have even sparked a debate here in Washington State that for much of the last decade would have been unthinkable: whether to finish a nuclear power plant, which was abandoned three-quarters finished in 1994, at the giant Hanford reservation. The organization building it, the Washington Public Power Supply System, known by its initials, W.P.P.S.S., and widely called Whoops, had a spectacular financial collapse and defaulted on more than $2 billion in bonds.
Officials at a successor utility consortium, Energy Northwest, said recently that the plant could be completed and generate electricity at competitive rates, given the recent spike in the market. But the idea outraged environmentalists and some utility executives, and prompted another official at the the consortium to say that it was about as likely to fill in the Grand Canyon as to resurrect the nuclear plant.

Now Playing

"ANTITRUST," starring Tim Robbins, Ryan Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook and Claire Forlani. Directed by Peter Howitt (PG-13, 120 minutes). Overplotted and overdirected, this thriller about high-tech corporate skulduggery is clever and likable enough to make you feel a bit sorry about the lousy timing of its release. Mr. Phillippe plays an earnest young geek seduced away from his friends' Internet start-up by a Bill Gates-like cyberguru (Mr. Robbins). Like most Hollywood movies about corporate villainy, "Antitrust," waving the banner of the open-source movement, feels a bit phony. But Mr. Howitt and the production designer, Catherine Hardwicke, do a nice job of capturing the ambience and idioms of the New Economy workplace (A. O. Scott).

* "BEFORE NIGHT FALLS," starring Javier Bardem. Directed by Julian Schnabel (R, 125 minutes). Mr. Schnabel's romanticized portrait of the exiled gay Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas, who died of AIDS, imagines pre-Castro Cuba as a pagan paradise of endless erotic promise ruined by the puritanical Communists, whom Arenas initially embraced then turned against. Mr. Bardem's arresting performance paints Arenas as an emotionally volatile daredevil. But this biography, which incorporates swaths of Arenas's writing, is sketchy, and the star's thick Spanish accent is daunting. It's still quite indelible (Stephen Holden).

* "CAST AWAY," starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 143 minutes). The core of this contemporary Robinson Crusoe story is an unforgettably gripping survival drama. Mr. Hanks is a Federal Express employee shipwrecked on a desert island after a plane crash. Physical survival depends on things like rubbing two sticks together to start a fire and cracking open coconuts. For companionship, he paints a face on a volleyball and names it Wilson. As in all his films, Mr. Hanks makes his character compelling by infusing him with a childlike openness. But the interrupted love story that frames the survival sequences is sappy and formulaic (Holden).

* "CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON," starring Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. Directed by Ang Lee (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Lee puts his particular stamp on the Hong Kong action film, and it results in "Sense and Sensibility" with a body count. Mr. Lee and the writer James Schamus are careful to invoke all the conventions of the genre, affectionately exposing them to parodic excess: there's so much high-flying swordplay that the movie seems to have repealed the laws of gravity. Mr. Lee also gives the proceedings a soulfulness not endemic to the genre. Mr. Chow comes across as the Cary Grant of the blade. But Zhang Ziyi is the real focal point of the film, and she claims it for herself (Elvis Mitchell).

"DOUBLE TAKE," starring Orlando Jones and Eddie Griffin. Directed by George Gallo (PG-13, 88 minutes). A shell game of a movie that will do anything to hustle a chuckle out of an audience. Mr. Jones is a smooth-talking investment banker named Daryl who finds himself implicated in a multimillion-dollar swindle while mysterious killers dog his tracks. The motormouth Mr. Griffin is a small-time con man who agrees to take on Daryl's identity as a life-saving gesture. "Double Take" has a criminal lack of attention: it ruthlessly sacrifices its own logic on a regular basis for a cheap laugh (Mitchell).

"THE GIFT," starring Cate Blanchett and Keanu Reeves. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 112 minutes). Mr. Raimi's moody exercise in small-town supernaturalism may belong, with "The Sixth Sense," to a special subgenre: the emotional thriller. Ms. Blanchett plays a young widow gifted with second sight who becomes embroiled in a murder investigation. The plot is adequate, but Ms. Blanchett plays her character with such feeling and intelligence that you forgive the film its logical and narrative lapses. The supporting cast -- especially Mr. Reeves as a backwoods brute and J. K. Simmons as a skeptical sheriff -- is also, for the most part, superb (Scott).

* "THE HOUSE OF MIRTH," starring Gillian Anderson. Directed by Terence Davies (PG, 140 minutes). One of Edith Wharton's greatest novels has been adapted by this English director into a powerful but extremely somber feminist allegory in which Ms. Anderson (somewhat miscast as Lily Bart but powerful nonetheless) is a precociously modern woman crushed by the cruel hypocrisies of New York society in 1905. More Dickensian than Whartonian in its telling, the story of Lily's downfall still has a crushing force. Laura Linney is exquisite as the treacherous, two-faced Berthe Dorset, who engineers her destruction (Holden).

* "O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?," starring George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Directed by Joel Coen; written by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen (PG-13, 143 minutes). The Coen brothers' latest picture is a whimsical, loose-limbed scramble through a Depression-era Mississippi that arises not from the pages of history but from a feverish imagination fed by old movies (chiefly Preston Sturges's "Sullivan's Travels"), folk music and Homer's "Odyssey." Mr. Clooney, in a witty, relaxed performance, plays Ulysses Everett McGill, who escapes from a chain gang with two goofy sidekicks (Mr. Turturro and Mr. Nelson). In the course of their ramblings, they encounter corrupt politicians, a blues-guitar prodigy and the Ku Klux Klan, as well as a cyclops and a trio of sirens. This whimsical tall tale has a warmth and conviction lacking in some of the brothers' other movies, thanks to a soundtrack full of blues, gospel and country tunes that prove immune to pastiche or cynicism (Scott).

* "THE PLEDGE," starring Jack Nicholson. Directed by Sean Penn (R, 123 minutes). Mr. Penn's grimly powerful third film, adapted from a book by Friedrich Durrenmatt, reunites him with Mr. Nicholson, who starred in his 1995 film, "The Crossing Guard," and who seems to be almost an alter ego. Here the actor plays a Nevada policeman on the eve of retirement who pledges to the parents of a young girl found raped and murdered that he will find her killer. His quest becomes an obsession. Mr. Penn and Mr. Nicholson (in a brilliant, understated performance) plumb the soul of this lonely, brooding protagonist whose mood is echoed by the ominously beautiful Western landscape. Benicio Del Toro, Helen Mirren, Robin Wright Penn, Vanessa Redgrave and Tom Noonan deliver incisive cameo performances (Holden).

"SAVE THE LAST DANCE," starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas. Directed by Thomas Carter (R, 112 minutes). A bland but poised melodrama for tweens not quite up to the sophistication of a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie. Ms. Stiles is a high schooler uprooted from the suburbs and transplanted to Chicago's inner city, where she meets a guy (Mr. Thomas) who shows her the ways of hip-hop, which are more than an attitude. (He does so without making the audience assume an attitude toward him.) The magnetic Mr. Stiles and an able young cast give their all to this stylish retread (Mitchell).

"SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE," starring John Malkovich, Willem Dafoe and Eddie Izzard. Directed by E. Elias Merhige (R, 90 minutes). Mr. Merhige's ambitious and uneven film is based on an audacious premise: that Max Schreck, who gave a haunting performance in F. W. Murnau's silent classic "Nosferatu," was really a vampire. As played by Mr. Dafoe, Schreck is both sinister and oddly sympathetic, and his struggle with the megalomaniacal Murnau (Mr. Malkovich) gives the film a flavor of Gothic behind-the-scenes comedy. Mr. Dafoe's intriguing performance and Mr. Merhige's keen visual intelligence -- most evident in his uncanny re-creations of scenes from "Nosferatu" -- offset the picture's dubious central metaphor, which is that moviemaking is, at bottom, a form of vampirism (Scott).

* "SNATCH," starring Brad Pitt, Jason Flemyng and Benicio Del Toro. Written and directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 105 minutes). "Snatch" follows the path of a stolen diamond through the hands, pockets and minds of a group of criminals from all walks of the lower depths. This spicy comic strip without an ounce of fat is Mr. Ritchie's return to the milieu of his debut feature, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels": the London streets of guys, guns and ill-gotten gains. The director seizes the bespoke machismo of British gangster movies and gives it an action picture's ferocity. The effort is hyper-real, and he plays it for comic potential. Everything clicks into place by the end, though, in what is literally a shaggy dog story (Mitchell).

"13 DAYS," starring Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp. Directed by Roger Donaldson (PG-13, 140 minutes). A competent and compact, though unsurprising, re-creation of the events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis, with Mr. Costner -- as President John F. Kennedy's right-hand man, Kenny O'Donnell -- graciously bowing out of the way to allow the president (Mr. Greenwood) and his brother Robert (Mr. Culp) center stage. Mr. Costner's move to the sidelines is as ostentatious as his Boston Brahmin accent -- he seems to be channeling Vaughn Meader. But Mr. Donaldson, despite having more confrontation scenes than all of the other Kennedy dramatization projects combined, brings an athletic rigor to the film. The movie is helped by Mr. Greenwood's crisp, intense President Kennedy: he's like a White House portrait come to life (Mitchell).

* "TRAFFIC," starring Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid, Benicio Del Toro, Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 140 minutes). Not since "Nashville" or maybe even "The Godfather" has Hollywood turned out an epic as resonant as Mr. Soderbergh's densely layered study of the Mexican drug trade and its devastating impact on the United States. In weaving together multiple stories, this intricate thriller, adapted from a British miniseries, jumps from Tijuana to Washington to San Diego to suburban Ohio. Mr. Douglas is the new American drug czar, Ms. Zeta-Jones the ruthless wife of a busted drug lord and Mr. Del Toro a Mexican policeman. Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Guzman are a team of government agents whose bust of a cynical midlevel dealer (Miguel Ferrer) precipitates much of the drama. Shot with hand-held cameras, "Traffic" builds into a profound and gloomy meditation on greed, violence and contemporary ennui. Perhaps last year's most remarkable acting debut belongs to Erika Christensen as Mr. Douglas's angry, drug-addicted 16-year-old daughter (Holden).

* "YOU CAN COUNT ON ME," starring Laura Linney, Mark Ruffalo, Matthew Broderick, Jon Tenney and Rory Culkin. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan (R, 111 minutes). This small, realistic gem, set in an upstate New York town, looks deeply and empathetically into the loving but strained relationship between Sammy (Ms. Linney), a single mother with an 8-year-old son, and Terry (Mr. Ruffalo), her wastrel brother who returns home after serving a jail sentence. The two share a special bond, having lost their parents in a car crash when they were children. Mr. Broderick is Sammy's stuffy new boss at the bank where she works as a loan officer. The tensions that erupt may not be the most melodramatic domestic problems ever filmed, but they're the stuff of life, and Ms. Linney's and Mr. Ruffalo's performances are achingly perfect (Holden).

Film Series

"A LIV ULLMANN RETROSPECTIVE." Liv Ullmann, the radiantly expressive actress who starred in such Ingmar Bergman films as "Persona" (1966), "Scenes From a Marriage" (1973) and "Autumn Sonata" (1978), is the subject of a retrospective that not only sheds light on her talents as a performer but also on her gifts as a director. This weekend, the series at the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, concludes with four films, two of them featuring Ms. Ullmann as actress and two showcasing her as a director. At 2 p.m. tomorrow, Ms. Ullmann co-stars with Ingrid Thulin in Mr. Bergman's "Cries and Whispers" (1973), about two women caring for their dying sister. At 4 p.m. she will be seen with Max von Sydow in "The Emigrants" (1972), Jan Troell's depiction of a Swedish peasant family's journey to Minnesota. At 2 p.m. on Sunday, the attraction is Ms. Ullmann's "Private Confessions" (1996), based on a Bergman screenplay about his parents' marriage. And at 4:30 p.m. the museum will show the 200-minute version of Ms. Ullmann's "Kristin Lavransdatter" (1995), a story of a 14th-century woman who chooses the man she loves over the man her father has chosen for her. With cinematography by Sven Nykvist, the film is adapted from the first part of Sigrid Undset's Nobel Prize-winning novel of the same title. Admission to the series, continuing through Sunday at the museum, 34-12 36th Street, at 35th Avenue, is $8.50 for adults, $5.50 for those over 65 and students with I.D., $4.50 for children 5 to 18 and free to children under 4. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Blue Chips Rise, but Nasdaq Falls After Greenspan Talks

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
The stock market reacted cautiously yesterday to comments by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.55 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,729.52. But the rally was confined to blue-chip stocks, as technology issues declined. The Nasdaq composite index fell 104.87 points, or 3.7 percent, to 2,754.28, in part because of a sell-off in fiber optics stocks after Corning warned of weakness in the telecommunications market. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.79 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,357.51.
Mr. Greenspan backed a tax cut and acknowledged that the economy had slowed considerably. But he gave investors few clues about how much the Fed policy makers might reduce interest rates when they meet Tuesday and Wednesday.
On another day, "news of support for tax cuts and at least no discouragement of the notion of a" half-point cut in interest rates might have led to a sharp market rally, said Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist for Deutsche Bank North America.
Though Mr. Greenspan artfully dodged most discussion of monetary policy, he "came across a little bit stronger in endorsing tax cuts than I might have expected," Mr. Hooper said.
After the Fed disappointed investors by not acting at its regular December policy-making meeting, it surprised Wall Street on Jan. 3 by aggressively reducing short-term interest rates by one-half of a percentage point. The move was a response to data showing that the economic slowdown was becoming more pronounced. Some economists and investors expect the Fed to cut rates one-quarter or even one-half point when it meets next week.
"Initially, the markets were a little nervous that his seeming support of tax cuts would obviate the necessity for rate reductions," said Jonathan Glaser, a hedge fund manager at JMG Capital Partners, a money management firm.
Mr. Greenspan dodged senators' questions about the form of a potential tax cut, calling those queries political, not economic.
"The market's disappointed he didn't say something explicit," said Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York.
Despite Mr. Greenspan's indication that the Fed recognizes the economic slowdown and may act to stimulate borrowing, investors could not overlook more obvious signs of slowing growth in technology companies.
Corning, a supplier of components to fiber optic networks, fell almost 20 percent yesterday after it warned Wednesday that its first-quarter profits could be weaker than expected because capital markets were tightening and telecommunications companies were cutting spending. Its shares fell $13.88, to $56.25.
The sell-off in Corning pulled down the shares of other fiber optics companies. JDS Uniphase fell $7.88, or 12.5 percent, to $55.19, while SDL lost $32.94, or 14.2 percent, to $199.19. After the stock market closed yesterday, JDS Uniphase warned that growth was slowing in the current quarter, even though it reported results for its second fiscal quarter that exceeded Wall Street's estimates.
Among the day's big movers, Cisco Systems fell $3.25, to $39.31; the company said it would invest $200 million in the Softbank Corporation of Japan.
Drug stocks rallied as pharmaceutical companies continued to deliver strong earnings. Merck, a Dow component, gave the index its strongest push, rising $2.94, to $81.88. Johnson & Johnson gained $1.19, to $91.75.
 --------------------

Treasuries Move Higher
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices gained yesterday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the economy was near a standstill, raising hopes for a sharp Fed interest rate cut next week.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 16/32, to a price of 103 27/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.23 percent from 5.30 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32, to 109 13/32. The bond's yield declined to 5.59 percent from 5.66 percent on Wednesday.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
The wages and benefits of United States workers rose solidly in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a year that posted the biggest annual gain in compensation costs since 1991, government figures showed today.
 The Labor Department reported that its employment cost index, a closely watched gauge of inflation, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in the last three months of 2000, down from a 0.9 percent rise in the third quarter. 
That reflected a job market that cooled late in the year from a red-hot pace. 
 A second report showed that sales of existing homes slipped 7.4 percent in December, to an annual rate of 4.87 million units, one of a series of reports showing how the economy has weakened sharply over the last two months.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that "as far as we can judge, we have had a very dramatic slowing down."
"We are probably very close to zero at this particular moment" in the first quarter, he said in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee.
Mr. Greenspan's comments were viewed as a further signal that the Fed, which announced a surprise half-point cut in interest rates Jan. 3, was prepared to lower rates again when it meets next week.
Many economists expected fourth-quarter compensation costs to register a 1.1 percent gain.
The wages-and-salaries component of the index, viewed by economists as the best measure of changes in workers' compensation costs, advanced 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 0.8 percent rise in the third quarter.
The cost of benefits, like health insurance and vacations, also moderated in the fourth quarter, rising 0.8 percent, compared with a 1 percent increase in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Fed Chairman's Testimony Before Senate Budget Committee 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, discussed the outlook for the federal budget and fiscal policy before the Senate Budget Committee yesterday. Following are excerpts from his testimony and exchanges between Mr. Greenspan and Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and the chairman of the committee, and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, in a question-and-answer session after the testimony, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.
 The sequence of upward revisions to the budget surplus projections for several years now has reshaped the choices and opportunities before us. 
 Indeed, in almost any creditable baseline scenario, short of a major and prolonged economic contraction, the full benefits of debt reduction are now achieved before the end of this decade -- a prospect that did not seem likely only a year or even six months ago. 
The most recent data significantly raise the probability that sufficient resources will be available to undertake both debt reduction and surplus-lowering policy initiatives. Accordingly, the trade-off faced earlier appears no longer an issue.
The emerging key fiscal policy need is to address the implications of maintaining surpluses beyond the point at which publicly held debt is effectively eliminated. . . .
In general, as I have testified previously, if long-term fiscal stability is the criterion, it is far better, in my judgment, that the surpluses be lowered by tax reductions than by spending increases. The flurry of increases in outlays that occurred near the conclusion of last fall's budget deliberations is troubling because it makes the previous year's lack of discipline less likely to have been an aberration. 
To be sure, with the burgeoning federal surpluses, fiscal policy has not yet been unduly compromised by such actions. But history illustrates the difficulty of keeping spending in check, especially in programs that are open-ended commitments, which too often have led to much larger outlays than initially envisioned. It is important to recognize that government expenditures are claims against real resources and that, while those claims may be unlimited, our capacity to meet them is ultimately constrained by the growth in productivity. Moreover, the greater the drain of resources from the private sector, arguably, the lower the growth potential of the economy. In contrast to most spending programs, tax reductions have downside limits. They cannot be open-ended. 
Lately there has been much discussion of cutting taxes to confront the evident pronounced weakening in recent economic performance. Such tax initiatives, however, historically have proved difficult to implement in the time frame in which recessions have developed and ended. . . . In today's context, where tax reduction appears required in any event over the next several years to assist in forestalling the accumulation of private assets, starting that process sooner rather than later likely would help smooth the transition to longer-term fiscal balance. And should current economic weakness spread beyond what now appears likely, having a tax cut in place may, in fact, do noticeable good. . . .
In recognition of the uncertainties in the economic and budget outlook, it is important that any long-term tax plan, or spending initiative for that matter, be phased in. Conceivably, it could include provisions that, in some way, would limit surplus-reducing actions if specified targets for the budget surplus and federal debt were not satisfied. Only if the probability was very low that prospective tax cuts or new outlay initiatives would send the on-budget accounts into deficit, would unconditional initiatives appear prudent. 
The reason for caution, of course, rests on the tentativeness of our projections. What if, for example, the forces driving the surge in tax revenues in recent years begin to dissipate or reverse in ways that we do not now foresee? . . .
The risk of adverse movements in individual income tax receipts is still real, and the probability of dropping back into deficit as a consequence of imprudent fiscal policies is not negligible. . . .
Let me end on a cautionary note. With today's euphoria surrounding the surpluses, it is not difficult to imagine the hard-earned fiscal restraint developed in recent years rapidly dissipating. We need to resist those policies that could readily resurrect the deficits of the past and the fiscal imbalances that followed in their wake. 

SENATOR PETE V. DOMINICI. -- Is, in your way of thinking, considering the size of the surplus and the other claims that you are aware of on this surplus, would it be reasonable for us to seriously consider the president's proposals in terms of tax reduction here in the United States Congress?

MR. GREENSPAN. -- Mr. Chairman, I haven't actually done the calculations. And, actually, if I did, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment because these are fundamentally political decisions and -- I mean, as a citizen, I have my own views, but I don't think they're appropriate to be voiced in the context where we're talking about the economics of fiscal policy. . . .

SENATOR PAUL SARBANES. -- Well, we've had a slowdown in the economy, but we haven't had a recession. Is that correct at this point?

MR. GREENSPAN. -- We are -- as far as we can judge, we have had a very dramatic slowing down, and indeed we are probably very close to zero at this particular moment. You know, we're only into a third of the first quarter. We know that the fourth quarter was a very small positive, but there is an inventory liquidation process going on, in part the result of the same forces which the technology changes, which has created a super just-in-time inventory system, which is having a very dramatic effect on reducing production in the manufacturing sector.

Q. Yeah, but presumably, once that works its way through the system, it will no longer be a contractionary factor.

A. Yeah. The crucial issue, Senator, is whether that marked decline breaches consumer confidence, because there is something different about a recession from other times in the economy; it is not a continuum from slow growth into negative growth; something happens.

HEADLINE: Mayor Giuliani's Budget Choices 

 BODY:
The $39.3 billion financial plan for New York City offered by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani yesterday would reduce taxes moderately in the next fiscal year and increase spending for schools, housing and cultural institutions, all commendable objectives. But the education hike, while increasing money for buildings, does not go very far toward hiring more teachers or improving class size. The overall financial plan also contains traps that could ensnare the next mayor in wider deficits. 
 Mr. Giuliani contended yesterday that his budget would actually reduce spending slightly in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. But that assertion was arrived at through bookkeeping gimmickry. According to the city's Independent Budget Office, spending would rise substantially, by 3.4 percent. It will rise even further if labor negotiations produce salary increases of more than 2.5 percent a year, which they are almost certain to do. The City Council has also vowed to restore the $700 million in spending for libraries, smaller cultural institutions and other programs that Mr. Giuliani wants cut. 
 The budget deficits, projected to be in the range of $2 billion for the next mayor, are certain to be driven higher by several other factors. Among them are a possible further economic slowdown, possible higher-than-estimated costs of welfare, and the costs of maintaining a large police force if there is a cutback in federal aid for police hiring. Indeed, the mayor's projections for more federal and state aid seem unrealistic, given that Congress and the State Legislature are under pressure to increase aid to schools rather than other aid to the city.
Compounding the problem for the future is that Mr. Giuliani once again is plugging the deficit next year by using more than $2 billion of the surplus racked up this year because of the flush economy. It is obvious that these surpluses will not last, or be available to the next mayor. 
Education will clearly be the focus of budget battles this year in Albany, at City Hall and in the mayoral race. The mayor's proposals to increase school spending are focused on supplemental programs rather than basic needs. The mayoral candidates will probably call for additional spending. We agree that more money has to be found for schools, as State Supreme Court Justice Leland DeGrasse directed last month in a landmark ruling that is now being appealed. Mr. Giuliani's plan starts the city down that road. But the next mayor will face serious problems on where to find the money to continue that journey.

HEADLINE: Oil-Drilling Issue Could Set Bush Against Bush 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
All week the White House has offered a partial solution to the California energy shortage and any future shortfalls around the country: more exploration for oil and gas, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
 But one place in which the new Administration has not talked much about drilling is off Florida, where the Interior Department is in the final stages of seeking public comment about a proposal to auction off rights to a six-million-acre field in the Gulf of Mexico. The federal government -- that is, the administration of George W. Bush -- is facing opposition to its exploration plans from the governor of Florida, Jeb Bush. 
 "I am confident," Governor Bush wrote in a letter on Tuesday to the acting secretary of the interior, Thomas Slonaker, "that the new administration will recognize the need to protect sensitive natural resources located both offshore and along Florida's coastline for the benefit of the entire nation." 
The issue is important to Governor Bush, the president's younger brother, whose political future may hinge on his ability to stop this and other new drilling off the Florida coast. But President Bush will hear from others with a very different view.
Oil companies that helped finance his campaign and that have allies in the cabinet have already been pressing to ease drilling restrictions along the Florida and California coasts. They cite the recent surge in gas prices to bolster their arguments.
Mr. Slonaker is not likely to have much of a voice in the matter; it will fall to Gale A. Norton, President Bush's nominee for secretary of the interior, who appears on her way to relatively easy confirmation by the Senate. Ms. Norton is a strong advocate of new exploration and exploitation of natural resources, though she has hedged on the issue of what to do in Florida.
In her confirmation hearings in recent days, Ms. Norton said she and the president opposed any new leasing off Florida, though she did not comment specifically on the lease the Interior Department is proposing to sell in an area Governor Bush strongly objects to developing.
"It is an important issue and we will certainly review it," Scott McClellan, deputy White House press secretary, said today, noting that President Bush has pledged to work with states and local communities on the issue.
During the presidential campaign, George Bush supported a moratorium, long in place, blocking new leasing of fields in parts of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Bush also said he was willing to work with local communities to determine what to do with leases already held by oil companies. 
But the area that his brother seeks to stop from being auctioned is not covered by the existing moratorium. It actually lies off the coast of Alabama, but close enough to Florida to worry state environmentalists.
"This puts everyone in a precarious position," said Mark Ferrulo, the director of the Florida Public Interest Research Group, which has long opposed any exploration or production along the Florida coast. He praised Governor Bush for opposing the lease, even though it is technically in waters off a neighboring state. "He has not gone this far before," Mr. Ferrulo said.
The governor has a large political stake in the issue. He faces re-election in two years, and is trying to recover from the political fallout from the disputed recount of the presidential election in his state. Drilling offshore is opposed by both Republicans and Democrats in Florida, and Governor Bush could be blamed if his brother's administration allows new drilling near the state's beaches.
"Florida's economy is based upon tourism and other activities that depend on a clean and healthy environment," Jeb Bush wrote in his letter to Washington. "As a result, we continue to have the nation's best beaches, abundant fisheries, and pristine marine waters. Protection of those resources is of paramount importance to the state of Florida."

Nasdaq Registers 3-Week Winning Streak

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index rallied to finish its first three-week winning streak since September as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates enough next week to lead to faster corporate profit growth.
 Qualcomm, a developer of cellular phone technology, led the gain after it reported earnings that topped expectations. Microsoft and Intel also rose as investors flocked to the biggest computer-related companies, which declined during the Nasdaq's record slide last year. 
 The Nasdaq rose 27.02 points yesterday, or 1 percent, to 2,781.30.
"Lower interest rates are almost always better for stocks," said James Floyd, who helps manage $180 million for Leuthold Weeden Capital Management L.L.C. "Investors are willing to forgive what's going on in the fourth quarter -- it's old news -- and they're taking a chance on things being better out on the horizon."
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 69.54 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,659.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.56 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,354.95.
The Nasdaq gained 0.4 percent this week. The last time it put together three consecutive weeks of advances was the period that ended Sept. 1. The S.& P. 500 rose 0.9 percent, while the Dow climbed 0.7 percent.
Qualcomm jumped $7.06, to $81, after reporting fiscal first-quarter profit from operations of 29 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny. The company also said it would meet profit forecasts for the second quarter and 2001.
JDS Uniphase rose $4.44, to $59.63. While the company, a maker of parts used in fiber optic equipment, said fiscal 2001 sales could be at the low end of forecasts because of slowing customer spending, it reported a fiscal second-quarter profit, excluding acquisition-related costs, that topped forecasts.
Microsoft rose $2.19, to $64, and Intel advanced $1.38, to $35.88.
PMC-Sierra plunged $21.88, or 23 percent, to $74 after it said sales would fall at least 25 percent from the fourth quarter to the first as customers bought fewer chips for telecommunications equipment.
Ericsson, the largest builder of cellular networks, dropped $1.75, to $11.25, after forecasting slower sales growth and cutting its estimates for profit margins this year. The company also said it would transfer the manufacture of its mobile-phone handsets to Flextronics International, which rose $2.81, to $39.
 --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
 (By Reuters) -- Longer-term Treasury bond prices sagged for the fifth time in six days yesterday as investors made room in their portfolios for a fresh lump of new higher-yielding corporate debt.
Motorola sold $2.23 billion in 5- and 10-year obligations, the biggest deal yesterday in what has emerged as the largest month of corporate issuance on record. Companies have sold more than $25 billion in new supply this week.
Seeking to capitalize on lower borrowing costs since the Fed's half-point rate cut on Jan. 3, corporations have sold a record $83.05 billion in bonds this month, according to Thomson Financial Securities.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32, to a price of 103 20/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.26 percent from 5.23 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 21/32, to 108 21/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.64 percent from 5.59 percent.

HEADLINE: Technology-Wary Investors, Once Scorned, Gain Respect 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
Michelle Brown was shocked when her investment club took her advice last summer. "Completely shocked," she said recently. Ms. Brown, a 31-year-old video producer, had suggested that the 19-member club buy shares in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, the style doyenne's fledgling publishing concern. 
 For two years, the club had been dominated by the roughly half of its members who work in the technology department of their employer, a Colorado charity group called Compassion International. By the beginning of last year, two technology stocks, Oracle and Cisco Systems, together accounted for about 72 percent of the club's $25,956.72 in assets. And club members like Ms. Brown who were not technologists had little voice in the group's investment decisions. 
 These days, though, more cautious investors are finding their voices, and those who for two years bought technology stocks at any price -- investors who bragged about their prowess, oblivious that they might simply have been rising with the market's tide -- have had to start listening. 
It is not that the meek now rule the earth. There is still no shortage of true believers in technology stocks. But after the market's retreat, diversification does not seem so fusty a concept, and its quiet advocates are no longer dismissed as losers who just don't get the new economy. 
For Ms. Brown's Colorado Springs investment club, her pitch of the Martha Stewart business "was a turning point," said Charles L. McGinty Jr., the club's 35-year-old president and Compassion International's communications director. 
"Back in '99 and early 2000, we had an attitude that virtually anything would go up as long as it was tech," he said. Those who suggested otherwise were politely ignored, as the technology advocates argued that "nontech companies were not going to grow nearly as fast." 
But then technology shares collapsed, with many Internet companies giving back 80 percent or 90 percent of their gains in the space of a few months. For all the frenzy over the technology boom, an investor could have made more money buying and holding onto shares of a diversified bond mutual fund at the end of 1998 than owning many of those hot-hot technology funds.
Now, the effects on investor behavior of a technology market turned sour are tangible. The flight from technology stocks has sent the Nasdaq composite index down more than 45 percent from its high last March, even after a rally this month. Flows of money into technology mutual funds remain weak. In the last three months of 2000, investors at Charles Schwab pulled more money out of technology funds than they put in. 
Even on Internet message boards, the wellspring of so much of the fervor for technology investing, the debate has been shifting. 
"More and more of our members are looking at the macro issues again, not for the next hot stock or the next hot trend," said Tara Burgess, manager of community development for Raging Bull, the popular financial message board site that is a unit of AltaVista. 
In this climate, there is vindication for both expert and novice who felt left out of the technology boom. 
"Last year, people were saying, 'Get me out of bonds, I don't care what they're selling for, I have to get into technology,' " said Lewis Altfest, a 60-year-old Manhattan financial planner who pushed his clients to stay diversified.
"There was a buying panic. People were saying 'I know it's irrational, but my friends at cocktail parties are making fortunes,' " he added. "I was considered to be someone who didn't get it. Well, thank God, I didn't get it."
Mr. Altfest said he lost about 5 or 6 of his 150 clients because he would not accommodate their technology stock lust. "We've gotten half of them back," he said, "with a mea culpa."
Ms. Brown's first attempt at getting her club to diversify came last June, when she pitched the group on Procter & Gamble. 
The stock, at about $62 a share, had been depressed early in the year and she thought it might be ready for a revival. There was also a personal attachment. Ms. Brown's grandfather spent more than three decades working for the Cincinnati company, and Procter & Gamble stock "paid for my college," as she puts it. 
But given the prevailing mood of the times and the club's dynamics, P.& G. was bound to be a hard sell. "When Michelle presented Procter & Gamble, it was pitched as a value stock, as a good buy at the time," Mr. McGinty said. 
That was not what the group was after. "I'm looking at long-term growth," said Jeffrey Wood, a club member who runs Compassion International's technology department. "I look at things like P.& G., and I just don't see it. I don't see the value of that stock doubling in five years." 
The membership passed on P.& G., which closed yesterday at $69.25. But as the year wore on, sentiment shifted. The club sold a quarter of its Oracle stock, whose shares have fallen by a third from their Sept. 1 peak, and all of its shares of Lucent Technologies, which dropped 81 percent last year. The members used the proceeds, and new contributions, to buy Calpine, a California-based power generator; Home Depot; T. Rowe Price; and Martha Stewart. 
Do not think these were easy decisions. 
"My feeling was that we should hold on to Oracle," said Michael Mikolaitis, a 49-year-old manager in Compassion International's technology department who feels comfortable with 70 percent of his personal holdings in the technology sector. 
"The concern was that the P.E. was too high, but Microsoft had a high P.E. for years," he said, referring to the stock's price-to-earnings ratio. During the bull market, such measurements were often rejected as too conventional for the technology sector. 
"You can't determine that a stock is going to go down because the P.E. is high," Mr. Mikolaitis added. "Looking 5, 10 years out, there will be market fluctuations, but that doesn't bother me."
But other group members who had been technology enthusiasts grew more cautious. 
"My concern about the club is that we've been pretty heavy in tech stocks, and as much as I like that industry personally, I'm not sure how smart it is to have so much invested in one industry," said Mark Hanlon, a 42-year-old club member.
This is not to say that the club will turn from meteor to mule overnight. By most measures, it is still on the meteoric side. Its kitty of $31,758.13 -- after a 22 percent decline in 2000 -- is now about half invested in Cisco and Oracle, an allocation that would cause even the most aggressive mutual fund manager to blush. 
But the baby steps toward a more balanced portfolio have begun. Debates are no longer about whether the club should diversify, but by how much, following its members' realization that nothing is a sure thing. 
"Today, there's no way we'd buy a stock with a high P.E. ratio," Mr. McGinty said. And that remains the case even after the recent, modest rally of technology stocks.
"I think from here on out we've seen we are vulnerable to having too much of our portfolio tipped in one sector," Mr. McGinty said yesterday. "That lesson is going to have a long-lasting impact on the club."
Recently, some of the most humble suggestions have come from the technology stalwarts. Warren Simmons, a 42-year-old network administrator, had pleaded with the club not to sell its Lucent shares early last year. By December, he had rethought his approach and pitched T. Rowe Price, the financial services company. 
"Even in bad markets," he said, "people need investment counseling."

HEADLINE: The Energy Calamity in California 

 BODY:
It is astonishing -- and alarming -- how little it took to cripple California, the incubator of high technology and a driving force in the nation's economic growth. Just a few years ago, the state's economy was booming and there was a modest surplus in electricity. Today California is scrambling to buy power at exorbitant rates, consumers have been hit with rolling blackouts, the utilities are nearly bankrupt and businesses are curbing production or threatening to move out of state. The only solace is that the crisis thus far is primarily financial. There appears to be enough power available physically if some way can be found to obtain it and pay for it.
 The causes of this debacle include a colossally wrongheaded deregulation plan, gross miscalculations of the likely demand for electricity, and a failure to build any new generating plants over the past decade. Virtually no one in the state foresaw the spectacular economic growth that occurred in the late 1990's, bringing with it an insatiable thirst for more power. Few sensed the urgency of building new power plants. Some generating companies were reluctant to invest in new plants until they saw how deregulation would unfold. Other plants may have been slowed by an onerous licensing process or by not-in-my-backyard opposition. Either way, the result was the same. Demand for electricity shot up. Supply stagnated. 
 Add to those factors sharply rising prices for natural gas and a shortfall in precipitation that feeds hydropower and you have the ingredients for escalating electricity costs. There are also hints that savvy (some would say rapacious) out-of-state generating companies have held power off the market so as to jack up the prices.
In deregulating its electric power system, California seems to have made almost every mistake possible. For starters, it deregulated only half the market. California's utilities have to buy power wholesale at market rates, but are limited in what they can charge their retail customers. That worked just fine when wholesale prices were low, but turned bad when wholesale prices soared, leaving utilities no way to cover their costs. The utilities are now billions of dollars in debt, and generating companies are reluctant to sell them any more electricity for fear they will not be paid.
The flawed deregulation plan also forced utilities to sell off many of their own power plants in the belief that the entry of other generating companies would lead to competition. But no real competition emerged, and when power supplies got tight, the utilities had less generating capacity of their own to buffer the shock. Worse yet, California would not let its utilities sign long-term contracts to buy electricity from other generators. That left them at the mercy of the spot market, where prices have soared to extraordinarily high levels.
Other states, notably Pennsylvania and Texas, have embarked on deregulation plans with initially favorable results, in part by avoiding many of California's mistakes. 
The burden of solving the crisis in California will largely fall on state officials, but there are national interests at stake as well. California's needs are already drawing down energy reserves and affecting some jobs and prices in neighboring states. And as the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified this week, it seems inevitable that the problems in California, which is roughly one-sixth of the American economy, will feed into the 49 other states. 
Thus it is discouraging that the Bush administration seems inclined mostly to look the other way. Administration officials have primarily suggested more drilling for oil and gas and a possible rollback of environmental standards to encourage power plant construction. That sounds more like using the crisis to promote other agendas than a genuine effort to help a struggling state.
California, for its part, is negotiating with generating companies to sign multi-year contracts that would stabilize prices, an approach that seems absolutely necessary but holds the danger of locking the state into prices that could look way too high when additional generating capacity comes online in future years. Hard bargaining over price and duration will be essential. 
Unfortunately, California's political leaders seem afraid to lift the caps on the retail price of electricity, lest angry consumers retaliate against them at the polls. But that deprives the state of a weapon that most economists deem essential to encourage conservation and to bring wholesale and retail prices into more rational alignment. Indeed, lifting the retail price cap would help restore the financial viability of the utilities and make generators more willing to sell them electricity.
California pioneered the move into the new era of electricity deregulation, and ended up teaching us a lot about how not to do it. Now it needs to muster the courage and intelligence to set matters right before its problems engulf the rest of us.

BYLINE:  By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
How generous are Americans? More today than a hundred years ago? Ten years ago? Last year? Only a God able to plumb human hearts could know the answer, but several quite human organizations try to keep track of the admittedly narrower but still not insignificant question of how much money Americans give to charities. 
 Recently, however, a married couple who have been painstakingly tracking patterns of church giving for years are asking whether the standard sources of data are systematically skewed, giving Americans the impression of being more generous than they really are. 
 It is not only the news media who rely on these sources. In November, for example, when President Bill Clinton applauded the fact that charitable giving had increased by 41 percent from 1995 to 1999, he was relying on estimates from "Giving USA 2000," an annual report issued by a nonprofit affiliate of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, a consortium of for-profit fund-raising companies. 
Also frequently cited are figures from the Giving and Volunteering in America reports periodically issued by Independent Sector, based on surveys of households conducted by the Gallup Organization. 
The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a journal that travelers shuttling by air between New York and Washington can often pick up free on the way to the gate, publishes an annual Philanthropy 400 issue that ranks the top 400 nonprofit organizations by the support they receive. The NonProfit Times publishes a similar list, the NPT 100.
The couple, Sylvia and John Ronsvalle, have raised questions about these estimates before, but last month they released a study, "The State of Church Giving Through 1998," that devoted an entire chapter to their concerns. 
"Every time we push, the numbers disappear," Ms. Ronsvalle says. "We don't care what the truth is, but it should be the truth. We only want solid numbers."
Since 1972, the Ronsvalles have been running a mom-and-pop operation called Empty Tomb Inc., which Ms. Ronsvalle describes as a Christian research and service organization. Their first activities were directing and coordinating services to the poor for various denominations around Champaign, Ill., where the Ronsvalles lived in public housing for 19 years. This commitment to serving the poor led John Ronsvalle, who holds a doctorate in clinical psychology, to start looking at trends in the contributions made by members of a wide variety of Protestant denominations. Since the couple's first study came out in 1988, two trends have clearly distressed them. 
The first is that, even when church giving increased in inflation-adjusted dollar amounts or in contribution per member, it steadily decreased as a percentage of Americans' disposable income. 
The second is that more and more of these contributions go to cover the operations and upkeep of individual congregations and less to local, national or international programs of spiritual and material aid. 
The Ronsvalles say they feel that one barrier to greater giving by church members may be complacency encouraged by some of the most widely used estimates of charitable giving. 
They note an obvious misimpression that people might take from the year-by-year comparisons in lists like the Philanthropy 400 or the NPT 100. Instead of including the same set of organizations over time, each year's rankings will add the more successful and drop the less successful. It is as if the Dow Jones index, instead of examining a fixed set of industrial stocks (with periodic adjustments), listed whichever were the top 30.
The Ronsvalles also fault these rankings along with Giving USA for presenting gains in aggregate numbers without taking into account increases in population and after-tax income. While calling the Giving USA series "a useful tool," the Ronsvalles argue that an alternative method of calculating religious contributions might reduce its estimates of total giving in 1998 by $25 billion. 
They suggest that all these publications are overly influenced by the fund-raising industry, which is naturally more interested in reporting success than failure. 
"I can see the concern about having a built-in bias," responds Melissa S. Brown, the managing editor of Giving USA 2001, the next volume in that series. "But Giving USA relies ultimately on tax data, from the I.R.S." 
Ms. Brown works at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, which has agreed to research, write and edit the 2001 edition for the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's nonprofit AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy. 
Estimating charitable contributions is highly complex and sometimes subjective. If it employs the reports of charitable contributions itemized on tax forms, it must also employ formulas for figuring out the contributions of non-itemizers. If one wants to get more specific about exactly what sort of people give how much and to what causes, the holes in the data must be filled with clever deductions and sophisticated survey techniques. 
To underline the uncertainty in the data, the Ronsvalles make a calculation comparing the Independent Sector's findings about 1998 "household contributions" to the "individual contributions" (as distinguished from bequests or corporate or foundation grants) estimated for that year in Giving USA. The former comes out to $78.3 billion and the latter to $134.1 billion. 
But Murray Weitzman, senior consultant to Independent Sector, said this was a simple $56 billion misunderstanding. The "household contributions" tracked by the Independent Sector's survey method do not claim to encompass all "individual contributions," which are estimated differently, with results close to those of Giving USA. 
To complicate matters, other studies, including some at the Center on Philanthropy, suggest that the major sources of information on contributions may actually be underreporting what Americans give rather than, as the Ronsvalles fear, overreporting it. 
One reaction to all this complexity would be to thank the Ronsvalles for trying to get an affluent nation to live up to its own self-image of generosity -- but to ignore their insistence on developing a more accurate picture of American philanthropy. 
That was not the reaction of Ms. Brown, however, at the Center on Philanthropy, which itself has been bringing scholars together to explore these questions. "Their overall concern that we need a way to understand all these studies is very valid," Ms. Brown said.

HEADLINE: Jets, Citing Benefits to City, Detail a Stadium Plan 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In releasing their most detailed plans yet for a billion-dollar complex on the West Side of Manhattan, the New York Jets said the economic benefits to New York City would come not from the football games in a new stadium but from an expanded convention center on the site.
 L. Jay Cross, the president of Jets Development, described the team's plans as first and foremost an expansion of the city's undersized Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, rather than as a subsidized football arena. 
 At his office in Manhattan early this week, Mr. Cross acknowledged that a publicly subsidized stadium produces huge revenues for team owners and players but has relatively little impact on the city's economy. Conversely, he added, convention centers make very little money but have a huge economic effect as thousands of conventioneers spend their money in the city. 
"All the economic impact is driven by the convention center," Mr. Cross said. "By marrying the two, you get the advantage of investing in the convention center, which will have an enormous economic impact, and as a side benefit, we achieve the purpose of putting a sports team in a state-of-the art facility."
The price tag: more than $1 billion, with taxpayers picking up at least two-thirds of the cost.
His argument contradicts the positions routinely taken over the last two decades by the owners of professional sports teams who have sought to build a stadium or an arena with public money. The owners, and the politicians who support their plans, have long contended that new stadiums and arenas spawn restaurants, hotels and other businesses. Many economists, on the other hand, agree with Mr. Cross, saying that the only things that grow next to stadiums are parking lots.
City officials said yesterday that Mr. Cross's proposal was promising.
"It would fill a void in New York City -- the lack of a world-class convention center -- and it creates a stadium that would make us a front-runner for the Olympics in 2012," said Anthony P. Coles, a deputy mayor, yesterday.
Critics of the Jets proposal complain that the city's hotels are already full, and that while New York may need a larger convention hall, it does not need an expensive stadium in an already traffic-choked area.
But Mr. Cross noted that state officials, hotel owners and tourism promoters have long complained that the 814,000-square-foot Javits center is too small. The center is fully booked, with about 140 trade and consumer shows a year, and is turning away billions of dollars in business, he said.
His new plans show a 75,000-seat stadium with 300 luxury suites built on a platform over the rail yards east of 11th Avenue, between 30th and 34th Streets. The stadium could be converted to exhibition space or used for conventions and concerts. It would be linked by a broad, enclosed bridge over 34th Street to the existing convention center. Additional convention space would be built on the north side of Javits, up to West 41st Street, with a hotel at the northwest corner of 41st Street and 11th Avenue.
The new complex would have more than 1 million square feet of exhibition space on one level, 365,000 square feet of meeting rooms and an 85,800-square-foot ballroom, the world's largest. A public promenade would overlook the Hudson River and include a stairway to a waterfront park.
Mr. Cross contended that the new complex would draw more than 300 shows and 2.8 million people a year, up from 2.5 million today. And, he said, each conventioneer would be spending about $2,000, in contrast with residents from around the region who attend boat and auto shows.
But Mr. Cross could not say exactly how many of the 300 events would use the converted exhibition space.
Mark S. Rosentraub, a dean at Cleveland State University and an expert in urban tourism and the sports business, said that the Jets might be overstating their case. Stadiums do not often work well as exhibition halls, he said, and New York is too expensive for many conventions anyway.
Scheduling may prove difficult as well, he said. The National Football League sets the dates for a team's home games each year, but conventions are planned three or four years in advance. To avoid any potential conflicts, the Javits Center might not be able to use the stadium on weekends from August through January.
"The reality is you're not going to convince a lot of conventions to come to New York anyway," Mr. Rosentraub said. "Nor are you going to convince hotels to lower their rates to compete for convention business."
Bob Brown, vice president of Convention Management Group, agreed. "We produce some very large shows," he said, "but we have chosen not to go to New York because of the costs and the union issues."
According to PKF Consultants, a hotel consulting firm, the average hotel room in Manhattan costs $240 a night, $100 more than in Chicago and $145 more than in Orlando, two big convention cities. New York also has the highest occupancy rate in the country, at 84 percent, meaning the city's 60,000 hotel rooms are full 250 days a year.
"It doesn't make sense to expand the Javits, at least in the near term," said John Fox, of PKF Consulting. "We're already effectively sold out. Until we build some more hotels, we couldn't accommodate more conventions."
But Mr. Cross and Tim Zagat, chairman of New York City & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau, said that hotel chains would build convention hotels near the Javits if they were certain that the convention center was expanding. Mr. Zagat complained that the Javits was missing out on billions of dollars in conventions, trade shows and tax revenues because of its size.
Charles Greco, president of IDG World Expo, recently moved the Mac World computer show from Boston to New York, where it attracted 61,000 people. He said he would move more shows to New York if the Javits expanded.
"New York has a reputation for being pricey," he said, "but it has the venue sex appeal that show operators are looking for."
In any event, both the stadium and the convention center are tangled in the often barbed political relations between Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In December, Mr. Cross released a preliminary proposal that showed the Javits connected to a new stadium. The Giuliani administration promptly embraced it, while Robert E. Boyle, chairman of the convention center, which is controlled by the state, said the proposal did not constitute a convention hall expansion and, therefore, was "dead on arrival."
Mr. Cross went back to the drawing board, eventually designing an addition on the north side of the Javits.

HEADLINE: Visions of Parting a Sea of Concrete With a Unifying River Greenbelt 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
The Los Angeles River, a trickle or a torrent depending on the weather, flows in a massive concrete trough through poor neighborhoods, under viaducts, by rail yards and around warehouses, becoming many things to many people. 
 It is a storm drain, because it is designed to carry water as quickly as possible to the Pacific Ocean. By default, it is a sewer with everything picked up by the runoff flowing with it -- a melange of trash, pollutants, fertilizer and animal waste. 
 "But most people who grew up in Los Angeles don't realize it's a river," said Melanie Winter, a board member and former executive director of Friends of the Los Angeles River. "They think it's an ironic name for a built system." 
There are small reminders of its origin, like a stretch near downtown called the Glendale Narrows. There, trees and grasses flourish in the riverbed as ducks bob along in the current; because the water table is so high, the concrete bed would not stay in place. It provides a glimpse of what Ms. Winter and others would like to see happen all along the river. 
"You just have to imagine we've gotten rid of all the plastic bags," she said, referring to garbage hanging in trees and lining the riverbed. 
Getting rid of the trash is now on the agenda. On Thursday, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board approved a measure to gradually decrease the trash entering the river, reaching zero in 12 to 14 years. The move is the first of many the board plans against pollutants.
But several cities, including Los Angeles, oppose the measure.
"We are definitely in favor of reducing and eliminating the trash in the Los Angeles River," said Judith Wilson, director of the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation. But the zero limit is "not achievable in our opinion." Ms. Wilson added, "and even if we get to 99 percent, it's still an opportunity for lawsuits by third parties."
Ms. Wilson said she would recommend appealing the decision to the state Water Resources Control Board, and lawsuits are expected.
But a variety of factors are helping the effort to reclaim the river. Engineering attitudes reflected in the paving of the riverbed, which began in the late 1930's, have changed. More natural solutions that allow water to spread over the land and percolate back into the earth are being emphasized. Attitudes have also changed about water resources. And Los Angeles has begun to reflect on its image as the most park-poor large city in the country. 
A master plan was drafted in 1996 and updated in 1999, and advocates and planners are reclaiming the river a little at a time. In most areas the river is enclosed by chain-link fence, but pocket parks have been created with river rock and native plantings in neighborhoods like the Elysian Valley near Dodger Stadium. 
A 4.5-mile lighted commuter bikeway runs from Burbank to the Elysian Valley. And in Atwater Village, across the river, small parks include a fitness trail featuring signs with yoga instruction rather than the typical chin-up bars and sit-up boards.
Similar efforts are going on downstream. The idea is to build parks along the river tied together with bike paths creating a parkway of green through the city.
Those efforts got a major lift last year as California voters passed a $2.1 billion park bond, part of which is being used to provide nearly $100 million for projects along the river. Included in that money is $45 million for a park at Taylor Yard, which would be the first new state park in Los Angeles in a generation.
"We don't have anything that unifies all the various communities, and a greenbelt park along the river would be a wonderful thing both symbolically and practically," said Buddy Roberts, a longtime resident of Atwater Village.
Still, obtaining land for a parkway will not be easy. Legal battles are being waged over the Taylor and Chinatown rail yards. Environmental groups have filed lawsuits to stop industrial development there. 
Joel Reynolds, a senior lawyer with the National Resources Defense Council, said the development, which is supported by the departing mayor, Richard J. Riordan, and the City Council, would not only deprive some of the poorest neighborhoods of parkland, but also draw diesel trucks, increasing pollution. 
"There's potential here to create something that's tremendous not just for the surrounding communities but for the city of Los Angeles as well," Mr. Reynolds said. "It's inexplicable to us why the mayor of Los Angeles would approve major industrial development on some the largest available vacant land in the heart of the city." 
Rocky Delgadillo, deputy mayor for economic development, countered that the development would provide desperately needed jobs.
"The per capita annual income is $7,000 a year," Mr. Delgadillo said, adding that development plans provide for open space as well as shops and cinemas that would provide needed community services. 
Behind the scenes, lawyers are working to find a compromise. Dozens of groups have formed an alliance to rescue the yards, and the fight is becoming an issue in the mayoral election this April.
The river presents a difficult set of reclamation problems. "The Los Angeles River is probably the most extreme example of a very damaged urban river," said Rebecca Wodder, president of American Rivers, a national organization dedicated to protecting and restoring rivers. "It has been just so completely remade by the corps of engineers in some places that it's just a sea of cement."
Floods in the 1930's killed nearly 130 people and destroyed hundreds of homes, leading the Army Corps of Engineers to create a gigantic waterslide that can bear, per second, up to 183,000 cubic feet, the equivalent of the water in two and a half Olympic-size swimming pools. The 51-mile river has a drop in elevation like that of the 2,250-mile Mississippi. 
"The striking difference is that a drop on the very top of the Mississippi takes weeks to get to its lowest point," said Vik Bapna, watershed manager with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. "For Los Angeles, that's 12 hours."
In many places, development goes right up to the river walls, leaving little room for natural solutions. Nowhere is the picture starker than at the point where the Los Angeles River and its Arroyo Seco tributary converge near downtown. 
So lush was the land in this area it provided the reason for settlement in Los Angeles. It is now the consummate picture of what the city has become: a maze of concrete viaducts arching over a concrete riverbed. 
"You may look at it and see a wasteland," Ms. Winter said. "I look at it and see a lot of mistakes that can be rectified."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about plans to clean up the Los Angeles River misstated the name of an environmental organization opposing industrial development projects on nearby vacant land that is sought for parks. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council, not National Resources.

HEADLINE: Court Upholds Rules Allowing Theaters' Sale of Air Rights 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A state appeals court, overturning a lower court decision, has upheld zoning rules that will enable more than 20 Times Square theaters to sell development rights to investors who want to build offices or apartments along Eighth Avenue or nearby.
 The rules, devised as an experiment in urban planning that would channel fresh resources into the theater business, provoked legal challenges soon after they were adopted in 1998. But in a unanimous ruling on Thursday by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, the court rejected arguments by a group of residents in the Clinton neighborhood that the city was encouraging intrusive, unchecked development in their area. 
 "This is a triumph for the New York theater and for the future of Times Square," Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, said at a City Hall news conference.
But opponents of the zoning rules said the court ruling had provided only a partial victory for the city, since their legal challenge had postponed any sales for more than two years, during what has been one of the city's most robust periods of real estate investment and development.
"We still ended with more than the city," said John Fisher, president of the Clinton Special District Coalition, which had been the principal plaintiff in the suit before the appeals court. He said the delay in enforcement meant developers had missed opportunities to take advantage of the new zoning.
The new zoning would mean large financial gains for some theater owners, but it also requires that the owners commit part of their profits to maintaining their buildings as legitimate theatrical houses.
It enables them to sell "air rights" -- the theoretical development space above their buildings -- to others who would use those rights to erect buildings elsewhere in a zoning district bounded by 40th and 57th Streets, and by Eighth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas.
Mr. Rose said yesterday that provisions of the zoning law require the theater owners to commit about 10 percent of their profits to improving their buildings or staging new productions, although he said the exact requirement was under study by his staff.
When they were adopted by the city, the zoning rules were intended to lure developers to the still tawdry blocks along Eighth Avenue that border the theater district, mainly to the east side of those blocks, where greater development incentives are offered. Taking advantage of the air rights they would purchase, developers could erect buildings on Eighth Avenue about 40 percent larger and bulkier than had been allowed.
Although the zoning rules upheld on Thursday would authorize the same increase in building size, the rules had been modified as part of the earlier ruling in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. That change, which Mr. Fisher called a victory for his group, was to permit developers to exceed the previous size limits by 20 percent without public review, but require environmental approvals for a greater increase in size.
Mr. Rose said yesterday that the appeals court ruling meant that the intention of city planners to "act in the public interest has been affirmed."

HEADLINE: Weakness Seen In Rise in Orders 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
Strong demand for airplanes lifted orders to factories for big-ticket goods in December, but that masked weakness elsewhere.
 Orders for industrial machinery and metal products were down, as were shipments -- fresh evidence of a struggling manufacturing sector. 
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, "will peer straight through the fog and see a very troubled economy," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "A big increase in commercial aircraft orders, which will be built three years from now, will not rescue this economy."
The Commerce Department reported today that orders for all durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- rose 2.2 percent last month, up from a 1.8 percent rise in November. Analysts were a 1.5 percent fall.
But the increase came mostly from a 14.6 percent surge in orders for transportation products. A more telling figure about the health of manufacturing, economists said, is orders for costly manufactured goods, excluding transportation equipment. Those orders fell 1.4 percent in December.

HEADLINE: Gillette Operating Net Up On Strength of Razor Sales 

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
Despite a loss related to factory closings and employee layoffs, the Gillette Company posted a 3 percent increase in its operating net income for the fourth quarter yesterday, largely on the strength of its razor blade business.
 Questions remain, though, about the Duracell division, where sales declined 6 percent and profits fell 31 percent. 
 Profit from continuing operations was $345 million, or 33 cents a share in the quarter, up from $339 million, or 32 cents a share in the period a year earlier. The consensus estimate among analysts polled by First Call/ Thomson Financial was 32 cents a share. Still, the stock fell 94 cents yesterday, to $32.69. 
"This company has a lot of work to do," said Sally J. Dessloch, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Chase.
The company, which is based in Boston, took a previously announced one-time charge that reduced net income by $430 million, or 41 cents a share, to cover the expenses of laying off 2,700 workers and closing eight factories. Including the charge, Gillette posted a loss of $85 million, or 8 cents a share in the October-to-December period.
On Monday, Gillette announced that James M. Kilts would become the chairman and chief executive, only the second outsider to lead the 100-year-old company. In a conference call with analysts yesterday morning, Gillette's current management suggested that the worst was over and that the company had begun to right itself.
Over all, Gillette's revenue increased to $2.82 billion from $2.81 billion, driven by substantial increases in the profits from blades, razors and Oral-B toothbrushes. Gillette said yesterday that sales of blades and razors, about 32 percent of its business, increased 10 percent and profits increased 29 percent, in part because the company was able to increase the price of its blades faster than inflation.
Edward F. DeGraan, the president and chief operating officer, said Duracell, which represents 26 percent of Gillette's business, suffered from a comparison with record sales in 1999 related to Year 2000 concerns. 
Mr. DeGraan said Gillette stumbled by allowing the market share for Duracell's copper-and-black batteries to fall. But Mr. DeGraan expressed hope that the company was taking back market share and continuing to win converts to the higher-priced Ultra battery.
"We feel we had to get back on track; we had gotten off track," Mr. DeGraan said.

HEADLINE: Layoff of 10,000 Employees Said to Be in the Works at WorldCom 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
WorldCom Inc. is expected to announce plans soon to lay off more than 10,000 employees, or 13 percent of its worldwide work force of 77,000, in an effort to cut costs at some of its slow-growing businesses, people close to the company said yesterday.
 The company, the second-largest long-distance telephone carrier after AT&T, is facing slower growth in businesses like long-distance, wholesale and dial-up Internet service. Some job cuts would occur in those areas as well as in human resources, finance and sales, people close to the company said. 
 The layoffs, which are expected to be made public in the next few weeks, are part of a downsizing wave in the communications industry. Some small companies like ICG Communications and NorthPoint Communications have laid off employees as they entered bankruptcy proceedings, while larger companies like Lucent Technologies, AOL Time Warner and Motorola have announced plans for layoffs in recent weeks. 
Slower growth of some communications services and tight financing conditions in a slowing economy have hurt both large and small companies, but WorldCom's troubles appear to stem largely from fierce competition in the long-distance business. WorldCom uses the MCI brand to sell much of its consumer long-distance services.
WorldCom is seeking to bundle consumer long-distance and other slow-growing products like prepaid calling cards and Internet dial-up service into a division with a tracking stock that would trade under the name of MCI, the long-distance company that WorldCom acquired in 1998. The restructuring would let WorldCom focus on the faster-growing area of providing data communications services to business customers. 
"The world is still waiting to see how WorldCom's retooling plans will be played out," said Adrian Davies, an equity analyst for Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. "We were expecting job cuts to possibly be part of the package, but it's troubling to find out they are of this magnitude."
The layoffs come as something of a surprise to investors in WorldCom, which was founded in 1982. The company's chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers, a cigar-chomping former high school basketball coach, built WorldCom through voracious acquisitions and is known for seeking to keep the company lean by keeping costs low.
The layoffs were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal.
But as growth has been slower than expected in WorldCom's businesses, some deals, like the acquisition of UUNet, the huge Internet carrier, may have disclosed redundancy in the company's work force, some analysts say. Former UUNet employees are known within WorldCom for their efforts to maintain a separate identity, even four years after WorldCom acquired UUNet's parent, MFS Communications, in 1996.
Though some analysts speculated yesterday that some of the layoffs could result from the integration of UUNet with WorldCom's Business Markets division, the company did not comment on exactly where the job cuts would occur. It was also unclear yesterday which geographic areas would be hardest hit by the layoffs.
WorldCom is expected to announce the layoffs formally before the end of the first quarter, people close to the company said. The company, which warned investors in November that its earnings and revenue growth were slowing, plans to release its fourth-quarter results next week. 
Analysts polled by First Call/ Thomson Financial are expecting WorldCom, which is based in Clinton, Miss., to report fourth-quarter profit of 25 cents a share, down from 42 cents a share in the period a year earlier, in what would be the first such decline in more than three years. Sales growth of 7 percent to 9 percent is expected in the quarter, in line with guidance provided by the company late last year.
"The WorldCom of today is not the vibrant, growth-story WorldCom of yesterday," said John Waterman, managing director of Rittenhouse Financial Services, a Philadelphia firm that sold its holdings of WorldCom stock worth several hundred million dollars in October. "Big layoffs like these are at the beginning, not the end, of WorldCom's confusion."
WorldCom shares rose 94 cents yesterday, to $21.31. They are more than 60 percent off their 52-week high of $52.50 in February 2000, but a rally in the last few weeks has pushed their value up more than 50 percent.

HEADLINE: California Lawmakers Debate Bill to Compensate Utilities 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Amid skepticism about the success of an auction intended to purchase long-term energy supplies, California legislators debated a bill yesterday that would help the state's biggest utilities recover billions they have lost buying electricity at prices far higher than they can charge customers.
 Consumer advocates said it appeared increasingly likely that residents would have to pay a major part of the price of solving the state's electricity crisis, whether through higher taxes or higher rates. Gov. Gray Davis, who has opposed rate increases as part of any solution to the situation, appeared to be softening his position, analysts said. 
 The bill in the State Assembly would allow the state to sell bonds to buy power for resale to the utilities. The state would receive stock warrants or other financial instruments that would appreciate if the stocks of the utilities' parent companies recovered. 
Shares in those companies, the PG&E Corporation and Edison International, both on the brink of bankruptcy, rebounded this week on news that a power auction arranged by Governor Davis had resulted in bids that could begin stabilizing the state's power supplies. Yesterday, analysts said there were more questions than answers about the auction's results.
Governor Davis had hoped to secure supplies at $55 a megawatt hour, but on Wednesday said that he was happy to have had bids offering what his office called a weighted-average price of $69 a megawatt hour. That average, it turns out, did not include much higher prices that would have to be paid for electricity during periods of peak use, officials said yesterday.
Aides to Governor Davis said he had not tried to deceive anyone about the auction. In a news conference, Governor Davis said those peak-period costs would make only a "minuscule" difference -- but he did not specify how much they raised the weighted average of power companies' bids at the auction.
Despite calls from legislators, state officials did not release other details of the auction, like the amount of power that generators offered to sell and the length of the contract periods. 
If the contracts extend longer than a year or two, some industry analysts say the state may be in danger of accepting bids that save money and reduce volatility in the short term but result in spending far more than the market price for long-term supplies of electricity. 
An executive at one major power supplier, who insisted on not being identified, said a typical proposal to the state would have offered power for $95 to $100 a megawatt hour over five years, or for $75 to $80 over 10 years. Power during peak periods would probably cost another $200 to $300 a megawatt hour, the executive estimated.
As for the legislation being weighed in Sacramento, Steven Fleishman, a utility analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, said it was too early to handicap its chances of passage. But Mr. Fleishman said it seemed clear that the bill was structured to allow for possible tax or rate increases. "I think the solution will be shared by a bunch of parties," including residents, he said.
A group of leading California economists issued a statement yesterday saying that rate increases were unavoidable.
"There is no other way out," the statement said. "Either retail prices must go up, or blackouts will continue with the consequent high costs to the California economy."
Governor Davis said that he still hoped to avoid a rate increase and that he was optimistic for a legislative solution. 
"We believe we will get there," he said. He also endorsed the concept of helping the utilities out in exchange for stock warrants or other securities that would appreciate if the utilities regained their financial footing. 
"Ratepayers should benefit from any infusion of capital," Governor Davis said. 
Consumer advocates blasted the legislative proposals as a bailout. "We haven't seen anything in the bill that holds out any promise that we're going to see anything but consumers assigned the entire bill for the fiasco," said Bob Finkelstein, a lawyer at the Utility Reform Network, in San Francisco. Should the eventual legislation give the state warrants or other securities tied to the performance of the utilities, that could create a huge conflict of interest, Mr. Finkelstein said, between the interests of serving ratepayers and bolstering the state's treasury. The state's Public Utilities Commission, he said, would be caught in between. 
"If the utilities come in and say, 'we need a higher rate of return,' what's the P.U.C. supposed to do?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Presidential Panel Recommends F.D.A. Regulation of Tobacco 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
A presidential commission says that the Food and Drug Administration should be given the authority to regulate tobacco for health reasons and that the government should compensate farmers who agree to stop growing the crop.
 As president, Bill Clinton named tobacco farmers, antismoking advocates and economic development experts to the panel in September with a goal of giving tobacco farmers an economic lift while protecting the public from the hazards of smoking. 
 In a preliminary report, the 10-member commission said today that the government should regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution and labeling of tobacco products to protect public health. 
Andrew Shepherd, a commission member and Virginia tobacco grower, said farmers who once wore baseball caps saying "Keep the F.D.A. off the farm" now see the advantages of regulation.
"As a consumer, I certainly wouldn't mind a lot more information on that pack, where it's from, how it's manufactured and what else is in there," Mr. Shepherd said.
Philip Morris, which has fought regulation in the past, now says it will accept some oversight. "Having a set of defined rules will help bring greater stability and predictability to our business," said Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for the company, which is the leading maker of cigarettes.
Dr. David A. Kessler, a former commissioner of food and drugs, said he doubted the sincerity of Philip Morris's endorsement. 
"I think they're looking for the stamp of social acceptability," Dr. Kessler said.
The report was forwarded to President Bush. His spokesman, Ari Fleischer, declined to comment, saying the report had not yet been reviewed.
At a campaign stop in Kentucky last year, Mr. Bush said Congress should give the F.D.A. "the authority necessary to discourage teenage smoking."
Under Dr. Kessler, the agency in 1996 reversed a decades-old policy by asserting authority over tobacco products and issuing rules to crack down on cigarette sales to minors. But the Supreme Court ruled last March that the agency had exceeded its authority.
Legislation that would have given the agency regulatory oversight of tobacco failed in Congress last year.
"I think this report from this White House commission is going to give us a good shot in the arm to get this thing moving," said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa.
The commission also sought to address economic concerns of tobacco farmers, whose numbers have dropped to 89,700 from 188,650 in 1978.
Increasing imports of cheaper foreign tobacco and declining cigarette sales have led to steep cuts in the amount of tobacco that American farmers can grow under the federal price-support program.
The report says that farmers should receive help shifting to other crops and should be paid for giving up their quotas, or allotments, that dictate how much tobacco they can grow annually.
The report said money to finance the buyout could come from cigarette taxes or the 1998 national tobacco settlement between states and cigarette companies.
Mr. Harkin signaled there would be Congressional support.
"Next year the farm bill is up," he said, "and we'll take another look at what we might be doing to encourage smaller farmers in the South to get out of growing tobacco and grow something else."

HEADLINE: Down Into the Fray 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
In this relentlessly partisan city, Alan Greenspan has almost always floated above the fray, enjoying bipartisan support built on his successful stewardship of the economy.
 But he is also one of Washington's shrewdest and most enduring political operators, cultivating ties to Democrats and Republicans alike while fortifying his own independence as chairman of the Federal Reserve under administrations of both parties. And he is well aware of the influence he wields on matters far removed from monetary policy. 
 So Mr. Greenspan set off considerable speculation about his motives when he reversed his own long-held position on Thursday and said the federal budget surplus was big enough both to pay off the national debt and accommodate a substantial tax cut. 
Was he making a purely economic judgment? Or was he putting some of his considerable political capital to work on behalf of the Republican agenda -- an agenda very much in sync with his own ideology -- just five days after George W. Bush moved into the White House?
His explanation of his decision was consistent with his previous view of what was happening to the economy and his stated preference for tax cuts as opposed to increased government spending. 
More so than even a year ago, he said, the government faces the real possibility that a wave of surpluses will wipe out the $3.4 trillion national debt held by the public within a decade and then leave Washington with hundreds of billions of dollars a year in excess revenue on its hands. 
Mr. Greenspan said he particularly feared that if taxes were not cut, the government would end up using the surplus to buy stocks and bonds, a prospect at odds with his philosophy that the government should play a minimal role in private enterprise.
"I never expected to see the day where I would be talking about anything other than reducing the debt," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday. "I am running into the tyranny of zero, which is where you can't reduce it any more. And so, have my views changed? Yes, they've changed; they have to change."
Republicans and their supporters knew immediately that Mr. Greenspan had vastly improved the odds of passing a tax cut of the scale proposed by Mr. Bush, $1.6 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Bush's plan would reduce all income tax rates, double the child credit, give a break to two-income couples and repeal the federal estate tax. 
Republicans in Congress have lots of ideas of their own for expanding the tax package, including a reduction in the capital gains tax, the addition of provisions favoring businesses, and expansions of the individual retirement account and 401(k) retirement savings plans. And the administration is close to a decision to speed up the tax cut by reducing income tax withholding this year, a development reported today by The Wall Street Journal. 
"Greenspan probably has more impact on the fate of a tax cut than the president of the United States," said Mark A. Bloomfield, president of the American Council for Capital Formation, a business-financed group that lobbies for tax cuts.
For Mr. Bush, whose father's administration had strained and at times hostile relations with Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman's stance on taxes held the promise of a more productive partnership. Mr. Bush's Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, has already signaled that he shares Mr. Greenspan's views on economic policy.
Among Democrats, though, there was a sense of disappointment, and some suspicion that after eight years with a Democrat in the White House Mr. Greenspan was revealing his true colors as a conservative whose ties to Republican politics date to Richard M. Nixon's 1968 campaign. 
To them, Mr. Greenspan had been a bulwark against fiscal irresponsibility. By opening the door to a large tax cut, they said, Mr. Greenspan was inviting a bidding war that could lead to a tax reduction so big that it could threaten the government's newfound fiscal health just as it is confronting the rising costs of providing retirement and health benefits to the baby boom generation.
"He's taken the lid off the punch bowl," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland. "And once you take the lid off the punch bowl, you can't say you can only have half a cup."
So distressed were Democrats that some of them said Mr. Greenspan might have hurt his standing among them. While they acknowledged that it was fruitless for them to fight the Fed chairman publicly, some of them said privately that he would receive less deference on Capitol Hill in the future.
"We've put him on this high pedestal, and we've fooled ourselves," said one senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. "This is a man with a very conservative background. This is not some objective, nonpartisan oracle."
This was not the first time that Mr. Greenspan has injected himself into a political battle. In early 1993, he publicly backed the deficit reduction program developed by the Clinton administration, even though it was built on a tax increase. 
In fact, Mr. Greenspan had worked behind the scenes after the 1992 election to stiffen Mr. Clinton's resolve in attacking what was then a huge and growing deficit. And his support helped move the package through Congress even though not a single Republican in either the House or the Senate voted for it.
But while the deficit in 1993 demanded immediate action, it is not clear, at least not to Democrats, that the current fiscal outlook requires an immediate and large tax cut. Not only is there an argument in favor of using some of the surplus money to address needs like improving health care and education, but the surplus projections could prove overly optimistic.
"Clinton's budget policy in 1993 was the right budget policy from the standpoint of the Fed and Alan Greenspan," said Alice M. Rivlin, a former Clinton administration official and a former vice chairwoman of the Fed. "I find this current move a little harder to understand, in part because I don't agree with it. His concern about the surplus seems to me to be premature."
Still, Mr. Greenspan's position left Democrats with little choice but to acknowledge that a substantial tax cut is now all but certain this year, and to shift their sights to keeping it at least somewhat smaller than what Mr. Bush has proposed rather than letting it grow larger.
They sought to focus attention on the caveats that Mr. Greenspan attached to his endorsement of tax cuts, most notably his insistence that they not lead to a repeat of the 1980's, when the Reagan-era tax cuts contributed to a surge in the deficit and the national debt.
Senator Max S. Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, "remains concerned that Chairman Greenspan's testimony could be misinterpreted as a green light for an excessive and exploding tax cut," said Michael Siegel, Mr. Baucus's spokesman.
Mr. Sarbanes said he feared that Mr. Greenspan's caveats would be lost in a rush to pass politically popular tax cuts, and spending increases as well, that could lead to deficits and economic problems down the road.
"There's not just a danger but a pretty high probability that this thing will get out of hand," Mr. Sarbanes said. "He's going to have to live with the consequences of what he's set off."

HEADLINE: Head of House Panel Backs Swift Action on Tax Rates 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
The powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which is pivotal to passing tax legislation, said in an interview today that he would consider moving quickly on a stand-alone bill to cut tax rates.
 Representative Bill Thomas of California, the new Republican chairman of the tax-writing committee, cited the testimony of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, before the Senate Budget Committee this week in saying that tax cuts could modestly soften the impact of an economic slowdown. But Mr. Thomas emphasized that such a reduction could have a useful effect only if done swiftly. 
 Mr. Thomas said that in order to move quickly enough to make any kind of difference, it would make sense to deal with an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates first, and then turn to less urgent cuts that would benefit some married couples and heirs.
This piecemeal approach would contrast with the way the White House and the Senate prefer to act on President Bush's plan to cut taxes by $1.6 trillion over 10 years. The White House and Senate leaders have stated they prefer moving the tax-cut package in one piece.
Couching his words carefully, Mr. Thomas made clear that he was simply taking under consideration Mr. Greenspan's testimony. On Thursday, Mr. Greenspan endorsed the idea of cutting tax rates across the board, even though he cautioned that such cuts could seldom be instituted quickly enough to help the economy significantly.
"If you're going to try to move something in the tax-cut area relatively quickly, it would be the marginal rate as opposed to the other provisions," Mr. Thomas said. 
Acting just on rates, Mr. Thomas said, would be logical.
"The more pieces you have, the more time you eat up making adjustments that are important to one person that are not important to another, and all of it at the expense of the piece that the guy who people are listening to says has some possibility of being useful, if done in a time- sensitive manner. Why put non-time-sensitive things on the plate?"
Mr. Thomas's opinion on how to move on Mr. Bush's tax-cutting proposal is crucial to the debate since almost all major tax legislation originates in the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Thomas has held his cards close to his vest, despite the abundant chatter on Capitol Hill this week.
Mr. Thomas noted that Mr. Greenspan's testimony significantly changed the debate over Mr. Bush's plan, making it more difficult for Democrats to oppose its underpinnings.
While agreeing that tax cuts are necessary for economic vitality, most Democrats criticized the Bush proposal as too large and skewed toward the rich. Across-the-board rate reductions tend to benefit Americans in higher income brackets.
This week, Democratic leaders questioned how Mr. Bush planned to pay for his other legislative initiatives, like strengthening the military and fixing ailing schools, since his tax-cut proposal appeared to use all the available money.
They urged the president to send a budget to Congress before pushing tax-cutting legislation so that lawmakers could see how it would be apportioned.
"His speech," Mr. Thomas said, referring to Mr. Greenspan's testimony, "and the questions following the speech from members of the Senate Budget Committee, I think, greatly enhance the environment for moving." 
He added: "Prior to the speech, I think it would have been a major tough fight. Following the speech, I think we have a pretty good chance of pulling the package together."
Mr. Thomas, who was careful to keep his glee in check, said he hoped that Democrats would trumpet Mr. Greenspan's words as loudly this time as when the Fed chairman said that reducing the national debt should serve as the linchpin in fiscal policy. Democrats would like to direct a larger share of the surplus toward debt reduction.
"The last time he made a major pronouncement on the economy, taxes and debt reduction, the Democrats hauled his quote up on boards in the well of the House, saying we need to do debt reduction," Mr. Thomas said. "I just hope they are as dedicated to the words of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board on the tax cut as they were to his words on debt reduction."
Asked to specify how large a tax rate reduction he would consider, and whether it would mirror Mr. Bush's, Mr. Thomas said only that Mr. Bush's plan was no longer far-fetched.
"All of a sudden the president went from an extremist to a reasonable kind of guy after the Greenspan testimony," Mr. Thomas said. "You have to find out what the Democrats feel. Have they changed their position following Greenspan?"

HEADLINE: In the Footsteps of a Bold Priest 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE WINCKLER; SUZANNE WINCKLER, who lives in Arizona, has written guides to American historical sites.

 BODY:
AFTER roll call at 8 a.m., the busload of 40 passengers, fully grown but giddy as school kids on holiday, left Tucson and headed south toward Mexico. Five guides, passing around a microphone, started pointing out historic landmarks, putting names on mountain ranges and desert plants, explaining the lay of the land and the chronology of its inhabitants. An hour later, at our border crossing in Nogales, we boarded another bus and were off on a three-day fact-packed immersion into the world of O'odham Indians, the Sonoran Desert, and the indefatigable 17th-century Jesuit missionary Eusebio Francisco Kino.
 Every March, April, October and November for the past 26 years, the Southwestern Mission Research Center, based in Tucson, has been taking people to visit seven or eight of the string of 27 Catholic missions established by Jesuit and Franciscan priests in the parched, prickly and bizarrely beautiful desert fastness of northwestern Mexico. This region and adjacent southern Arizona (which until 1821 was part of Spain and then of Mexico until 1854) has long been known as the Pimeria Alta, a reference to the northern group of Indians called Pimas by the Spaniards and now more commonly called O'odham (pronounced, approximately, ah-ah-DOM), which means "the people" in their own language. 
 The churches are often referred to as Kino missions -- not because Father Kino established each and every one of them but because he was the first Roman Catholic priest to hazard the assignment of converting unknown subjects in this arid and thorny landscape.
The Kino missions, some crumbling ruins, others still thriving churches, are windows onto a time when a scattering of stoic desert-dwelling Indians were besieged by priests who desired their souls and by Apaches who hectored and stole from them. 
Kino was born in Italy in 1645 and educated in Austria. He arrived in the Pimeria Alta in 1687 and began to establish a beachhead among the O'odham. Over the next quarter century he founded 27 missions, covering much of the territory of northern Sonora and southern Arizona, an expanse of some 62,000 square miles. 
It is hard to fathom what resources of optimism, faith, charity, entrepreneurship or fanaticism Father Kino possessed to head off into such inhospitable terrain. But head off he did, and in so doing he left an indelible footprint in the desert. Besides the liturgy, Father Kino brought wheat and livestock. Today, Sonora and southern Arizona remain ranching and farming cultures, and the daily bread is flour -- not corn -- tortillas. 
One of the great pleasures of terrestrial travel is the succession of fleeting, almost dreamlike images, framed like paintings in the bus window, of landscapes, people, dogs, buildings, plazas, the sky, livestock. From this trip, I will always remember women in roadside stands tossing and flipping giant paper-thin tortillas made, at least in a metaphorical sense, with Father Kino's wheat.
In three days in April we visited eight missions, all within a radius of about 60 miles and barely 50 miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border. We encamped both nights in Caborca at Motel El Camino, a lodge where the friendly staff and good food made up for some infrastructure lapses, such as the less than reliable supply of hot water.
The proximity of the missions to the United States, along with increasing, if somewhat spartan, tourist accommodations in the region resulting from the booming Nafta economy, means that mission-seekers could do this route on their own. But they would forgo the joys of the Southwestern Center's tour, which include the abundant knowledge and enthusiasm of the guides, the camaraderie of the group, the confidence of being with numerous people fluent in Spanish, and the miraculous appearance at 10:30 a.m. every day of an ice chest laden with an assortment of Mexican cervezas. One must treasure those rare times in life when the transfer of knowledge can be chased with ice-cold beer. 
Although the Kino tour focuses on events of 300 years ago, the guides and participants (at least those on our tour) savor the present. Our first stop was in Imuris, a small town about 35 miles south of Nogales, where the cafe in the bus station is noted for its cuisine. Not a timid eater among us, we were soon feasting on exquisite quesadillas con nopales (the tangy pads of prickly-pear cactus). On the evening of the second day, in the town of Caborca, our party scattered to benches around the perimeter of the plaza at Mission La Purisima Concepcion de Nuestra Senora and, in the waning romance of the setting sun, watched a wedding in progress.
The first mission on the tour was Nuestra Senora del Pilar y Santiago de Cocospera, on the mountainous Highway 2 about halfway between Imuris and Cananea. It sits on a bluff above the valley of the Rio Babasac. A dissolving pile of adobe and brick, it is saved from total decay by a scaffolding erected in the 1980's by the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia. 
In its poignant state of suspended animation, Nuestra Senora del Pilar y Santiago was a concise introduction to the pulses of prosperity and decline that characterized the interplay among the O'odham, the Catholic missionaries and the Apaches, who had become master raiders after acquiring horses from the Spanish conquistadors. 
Kino established the mission in the late 1680's, and its first church was dedicated in 1704, after the Apaches had burned a previous church to the ground in 1698. The new mission and its O'odham converts, or semiconverts, experienced a brief time of relative calm until 1711 when Kino died and things began to unravel. In 1746 the Apaches torched the mission. In 1767 the Jesuits were expelled by King Carlos III of Spain to be replaced a year later by Franciscan priests. The last Franciscan left Cocospera in 1836. The Apaches continued to hammer the mission and the Indians, and by the 1840's it was abandoned. 
Unlike the Jesuit pragmatists -- believers in commerce, innovation, resource development, hard work and no nonsense -- the Franciscans inspired a broad interest in literature and the arts (including that of the natives). At Cocospera the Franciscan priests and O'odham artisans left their stamp on the simple adobe Jesuit mission. They added a fired-brick facade, a barrel-vaulted ceiling and interior decoration. Indeed, the scaffolding at Cocospera was constructed to keep an elaborate Franciscan facade from peeling off its plain Jesuit face. 
The best preserved and most ornate expression of Franciscan art and architecture is Mission San Xavier del Bac, on the Tohono O'odham Reservation, 10 miles south of Tucson. It is usually the grand finale on the Kino mission trip, unless, as in our case, border-crossing delays throw the tour off schedule. It is certainly worth a pilgrimage.
Against its desert backdrop, San Xavier del Bac can almost be mistaken for a shimmering white mirage. Jesuits established the mission and erected their last church here in 1756. In 1781, the Franciscan priest Juan Bautista Velderrain started the very ambitious and expensive task of constructing San Xavier. He died before it was completed 16 years later. San Xavier del Bac is a thriving church that is open daily. 
A distinctive refrain among the Kino missions is their settings. Every one we visited stood on a prominence near a river. The practicalities of placement are obvious. The church, priest and his O'odham flock were protected from flooding (desert rivers often rampage during summer monsoons), but close enough to tend the flood plain fields, where crops were planted.
The elevation also provided a long view -- allowing the O'odham to see the Apaches in time to retreat to the mission, which then became a fortress. Practicalities have a way of providing other gratifications, which include the ineffable pleasure of standing on the brow of a hill overlooking a broad valley. 
While Nuestra Senora del Pilar y Santiago de Cocospera is a bona fide ruin, the other missions we visited over the next two days are very much part of the religious present. People worship in them and mill on their plazas and bedeck their cemeteries with mementos. When our group arrived on Saturday morning at Mission San Antonio de Padua in the village of Oquitoa, a parishioner, heedless of interlopers, was pulling ropes to ring the twin bells in the dazzling white belfry. 
The cemetery at Mission San Antonio de Padua de Oquitoa is an especially vivid reminder of the Hispanic attentiveness to the departed. It is elbow-to-elbow with funereal statuary (also blinding white) garlanded with bright plastic flowers. (The mission tours in October often coincide with preparations for the Dia de los Muertos, when Mexican families honor the dead with picnics and elaborate graveside decorations.)
All the missions possess an atmosphere of serenity -- the interior shade and coolness provided by thick adobe walls are inviting on a sweltering day -- and each has a memorable or enigmatic element. I do not think my fellow travelers and I will soon forget the choir loft and spiral staircase of ancient mesquite timbers at Mission San Ignacio de Caburica in the village of Caburica, or the penitents at Santa Maria in Magdalena lifting the heavy wooden head of the recumbent statue of San Xavier (if a person is unable to lift the saint's head, he or she is deemed unrepentant), or the seashell-shaped entryway to Mission San Pedro y San Pablo del Tubutama, or the ghostly O'odham wall paintings of skeletons, animals, and Lucifer with a serpent's tail at San Diego Pitiquito, in the village of Pitiquito.
BUT perhaps the most unforgettable and unexpected episode on the trip was encountering Father Kino himself. In 1711 Father Kino was visiting one of his new chapels in the village of Magdalena when he fell ill and died. He was laid to rest near the altar in the new chapel.
As time passed, the exact location of the grave was lost while Father Kino's stock began to rise. He is a revered figure throughout Mexico, but especially in Sonora and Arizona (his statue stands in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda as a representative of the state), so in 1965 a team of international investigators was appointed to search for his remains. Eight months later, and 255 years after his death, they found Father Kino. Today, in the plaza of Magdalena de Kino (the city changed its name after the discovery of his remains) he lies under a glass dome on the dusty Sonoran Desert earth for all pilgrims to view. His skull has two incisors missing, and a dainty cassock button is perched on his breastbone.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Mexico City

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER; TIM WEINER is a correspondent in the Mexico City bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
Mexico City, the Western Hemisphere's biggest city, is a magnificent madhouse. Close to 20 million people live here, in more than 350 neighborhoods covering 779 square miles, and some days it's a wonder how. Minor earthquakes are commonplace, major traffic jams more so. Driving anywhere is a daily adventure, the only constant being the fire eaters, jugglers and clowns panhandling for pesos at traffic lights. 
But Mexico City is alive, vibrant, throbbing in ways that few places in the United States can match. A sophisticated city-state since at least the 15th century, it possesses the power to endure. Tourists who see the capital only as a place to change planes on the way to Mexico's resorts or Maya ruins are missing one of the world's most interesting urban areas. Amid the chaos are neighborhoods and parks as tranquil as any in the world, great food, fabulous museums and a proud sense of possibility that has come with the new presidency of Vicente Fox, Mexico's first truly democratically elected leader. 
Change is not the only thing in the air, of course. Mexico City has a reputation for some of the world's worst pollution. But there has not been a smog alert here for more than a year; most mornings dawn crisp and clear. And while the air seems brownest in winter, by the end of February nights become warmer, the sky turns bluer, and trees and plants explode with color.
The crime wave brought on by the economic crisis of five years ago also seems to be ebbing, although the statistics are suspect. Visitors still should watch their wallets, know where they are going and never hail a street taxi. Instead, use radio cabs -- like Servicio Taxi-Mex, (52-5) 519-7690 -- or licensed taxi stands, called sitios. With a good hotel, a good map and good sense, the city is a wonderful place to visit, even if you may not want to live here. 
Mexico City is best comprehended when broken up into its colonias, or neighborhoods. Seven are noted here, along with the centrally situated Chapultepec Park. The historic center, the Zona Rosa and Polanco all can be thought of as downtown. Condesa and Roma are less than a mile south of the Zona Rosa. Coyoacan and San Angel are about six miles farther south.
For information, call Infotur: (52-5) 525-9380. Tours with an English-speaking guide can be reserved through the National Associations of Guides, (52-5) 592-0365, fax (52-5) 591-0418. The prices below are converted at 9.5 pesos to the dollar. 

Events
Celebrating at least 500 fiestas and festivals a year, Mexico City takes its holidays seriously, with fireworks and food to match. Next on the calendar is Candelaria, or Candelmas, on Friday. Dolls representing the Christ child and newborns hidden from King Herod are taken to churches to be blessed. The processions are especially ornate at La Merced market in the historic center.
Carnaval, Mexico's equivalent of Mardi Gras, falls on Feb. 25 to 27, an annual explosion of joy. While it is not as wild as in, say, New Orleans or Veracruz, the Zocalo, the great square in the historic center, will be a scene of revelry. 
During the Historic Center Festival, March 6 to 31, most of the colonial-era monuments and plazas in and around the Zocalo, including the Palace of Fine Arts and the Metropolitan Cathedral, will have concerts, plays, dances, art shows and children's activities. A complete schedule is still in the works, but announced participants include American Ballet Theater, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, the Sydney Dance Company and what sounds like the guest list for the world's most interesting dinner party: Mikhail Gorbachev, John Irving, Carlos Fuentes, Noam Chomsky, Yo-Yo Ma, Wole Soyinka and Susan Sontag. The program coordinator, Noemi Rodriguez, can be reached at (52-5) 277-9697, fax (52-5) 272-2936. The weekly magazine Tiempo Libre, www .tiempolibre.com.mx, will list all events, as well as almost everything else interesting going on in the city. 
"The World of Charles V," dedicated to the glory of the 16th-century Spanish monarch whose rule coincided with the Spanish conquest of Mexico, features works by Velazquez and El Greco. It runs through Feb. 25 at the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso, an 18th-century school near the heart of the historic center at Justo Sierra 16, (52-5) 702-2834. Closed Monday; admission $3. 

Sightseeing
The enormous National Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park at Reforma and Gandhi, (52-5) 553-6381, contains 26 rooms, halls and salons covering 30 centuries of human history. The art, artifacts and models of Mesoamerican civilization stir the soul; the Maya hall alone could take up one visit. A $13 million renovation completed last month added high-tech and interactive accouterments. Closed Monday; admission $3, Sunday free.
The 60 blocks of the historic center incorporate the Zocalo, the National Palace, the 428-year-old Metropolitan Cathedral and the far older Templo Mayor, an Aztec site. The entire area was declared a World Heritage site by the United Nations in 1987. Last year the city undertook a $300 million renovation effort; the 10-acre Zocalo, one of the world's largest public squares, is scheduled for a face lift, including plants, grass and benches. Diego Rivera's greatest murals, depicting five centuries of Mexican history, are in the National Palace (admission is free, but a photo ID is required). The cathedral, with its ornate classical, neoclassical and Baroque art and architecture, is slowly sinking; only sophisticated restoration has kept it from collapsing. The remains of the ceremonial pyramid of the Aztec capital razed by the Spanish conquerors is in the Templo Mayor's fine museum (admission $2.50; closed Monday). 
Chapultepec Park, the city's green island, is across from the anthropology museum and is open from dawn to dusk. Its 2,100 acres include a zoo, recently renovated, with five pandas among its 1,300 animals (free, closed Mondays). The excellent hands-on children's museum, Papalote, Constituyentes 268, features interactive games, mazes, puzzles, dioramas -- everything from hatching quail eggs to immense jungle gyms -- that can be enjoyed without speaking Spanish. Admission $4; (52-5) 237-1700, www.papalote.org.mx. The park also contains the Rufino Tamayo Museum of Contemporary Art, at Reforma and Gandhi, and the Museum of Modern Art. Both closed Monday; $1.50 each.
The house where the painter Frida Kahlo was born, and where she lived during her tumultuous marriage to Diego Rivera, at Londres 247 in Coyoacan, a charming enclave, is now a museum showing art and artifacts of her life. Closed Monday; (52-5) 554-5999. 
For an unusual escape from the city, Mountain Bike Mexico, (52-5) 846-0793, offers a 21-mile one-way trip, mostly downhill, to the Teotihuacan pyramids for $120, including transportation to and from hotels.

Where to Stay
Habita, Masaryk 201, (52-5) 282-3100, fax (52-5) 282-3101, www.hotel habita.com, is a chic new place in Polanco, with 36 minimalist rooms, a pool, restaurant, spa and business center. Doubles: $235. 
A colonial mansion listed as an "artistic monument" by the National Institute of Fine Arts contains the 29-room La Casona, Durango 280, (52-5) 286-3001, fax (52-5) 211-0871, featuring 19th-century rooms with 21st-century amenities, including a business center and a gym, not far from Chapultepec Park, in the Roma neighborhood. Doubles: $130.
Budget: The 105-room Gran Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, Avenida 16 de Septiembre 82, (52-5) 510-4040, fax (52-5) 512-2085, is in a converted Art Nouveau department store, with cage elevators, stained-glass ceilings and simple but comfortable rooms in the historic center. Doubles: $98. 
An old favorite of budget travelers, and justly so, is the 136-room Hotel Maria Cristina, Rio Lerma 31, (52-5) 566-9688, fax (52-5) 566-9194, a well-run, spotless place with a nice little garden, a good bar and a central location. Doubles: $60. 
Luxury: Casa Vieja, Eugenio Sue 45, (52-5) 282-0067, www.casavieja .com. has 10 regally decorated colonial-style suites on a side street in Polanco equipped with the works -- kitchen, Jacuzzi bath, VCR, fax machines -- and a good restaurant downstairs. Suites are $350, $550 and $850. 
Also in the Polanco district, facing Chapultepec Park, is the modern Nikko Mexico, Campos Eliseos 204, (52-5) 280-1111, fax (52-5) 280-9191, www .nikkohotels.com/americas/ mexico.html. The 750-room hotel, with tennis, a gym and a pool, has four restaurants. Doubles: $280.

Where to Eat
It is difficult to get a bad meal in a city with some of the world's best and cheapest street food and too many restaurants to count. But some very bad places seem to get by on their looks, like Los Girasoles on Plaza Manuel Tolsa, in the historic center. It's pretty; the food is not. And few Mexicans sit down to lunch before 1 p.m. or dinner before 9.
Cafe Tacuba, Tacuba 28, (52-5) 518-4950, combines a gorgeous, turn-back-the-clock 18th-century setting with gaily painted walls in the historic center with old-fashioned, inexpensive, traditional Mexican food, like chicken enchiladas with green sauce. It's a casual place that's good for breakfast, hectic at dinner, often open around the clock. A meal for two with drinks: $20 or less. 
Another colorful, traditional place near the heart of the city is El Danubio, Uruguay 3, near the Eje Central, (52-5) 512-0912, with soulful Spanish and Mexican dishes, and especially good seafood. $40. 
Inventive French food with Mexican influences is served in an elegant if slightly surreal setting at Les Moustaches, Rio Sena 88, (52-5) 533-3390, near the Zona Rosa. Definitely Mexico City's best ostrich carpaccio plus culinary antiquities like oysters Rockefeller and beef Wellington; one of its better wine lists. Dinner for two with wine: $60. Open Monday to Saturday, 1 p.m. to midnight. 
Although it is six miles south of the city center, the San Angel Inn, Diego Rivera 50, San Angel, is worth the taxi ride, with European and Mexican dishes in a hacienda dating from 1692. It may be the only restaurant in Mexico to have served both George Gershwin and Mick Jagger. Formal and casual dining rooms and by all accounts the best Sunday brunch in town. Dinner for two with wine: $70 and up. Reservations are essential: (52-5) 616-2222, fax (52-5) 616-0973. 
At the corner of Michoacan and Tamaulipas in the Condesa neighborhood, which is lined with good, inexpensive restaurants, Sep's feels like a long-ago place in Paris, with Alsatian pates, cold cuts and cheese, good wine and steaks, and a hopping sidewalk scene. Lunch or dinner for two with wine: $40; (52-5) 286-6286.

Where to Shop
Mexico City is a paradise for flea-market and art lovers. The best of all for arts and crafts is the Saturday market at the Plaza San Jacinto in San Angel, a gorgeous colonial neighborhood; (52-5) 616-0082. The strangest is La Lagunilla, a bizarre bazaar in the center of town at Eje 1 Norte and Brazil, best experienced Sunday morning, with amazing art, antiques and jewelry amid authentic junk.
 In the Zocalo is the state-founded pawnshop, Monte de Piedad, opened in the 18th century as a charity, with a fine selection of old jewels and gewgaws. Open weekdays 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; (52-5) 521-6176.

HEADLINE: Stronger Than Steel 

BYLINE:  By Stephen J. Dubner; Stephen J. Dubner, the author of "Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family," is writing a memoir of hero worship.

 BODY:
Twenty-eight years after the Miracle, he still has the most recognizable face in town. The sharp eyes, the Roman nose, the caramel skin, the plush beard. And a regal, weary carriage, like one of the three wise men. 
 On his way into the stadium, they paw and claw -- One picture, Franco!" "I was there, Franco, just lemme shake your hand!" -- and he stops for everyone. They know his face, his career stats, his provenance: one of nine children born to an Italian mother and an American soldier, a black man from Mississippi, who met in Italy at the end of the war. 
 Now a dusky blonde, no more than five feet tall, nearly knocks him over. "Oh, my God, it's you!" she says. "Oh, my God. Thirty years I've been waiting for this." The woman starts beating her chest with both palms. 
He looks perplexed for a moment, then glances down and grins. She is wearing a faded mesh Steelers shirt, No. 32, his number.
"Whoa," he says. "Thirty years. Get out the mothballs."
He is dressed in an olive raincoat over a nice, greenish sports jacket, a black sweater and black trousers. His shoes are black leather -- with rubber soles. The Astroturf is slick from the rain, and they are asking him to re-enact the Miracle today, one last sip of glory before they drill 2,700 holes in Three Rivers Stadium, plant the dynamite and, on Feb. 4, blow it up.
He watches the last few minutes of the game from the end zone. He pulls on a crisp black No. 32 that a Steelers marketing man unpacks from a box and, when the p.a. announcer calls his name, joins the rest of his old teammates parading out to midfield under the steady throb of cheers. Then the announcer says, "How about one more look at the greatest play in N.F.L. history -- one more time!"
Franco Harris, out at the 30-yard line, is tossed a football and, at maybe one-third the original speed, retraces the steps of the last-second, hair's-breadth, game-winning catch that came to be known as the Immaculate Reception. By the time he reaches the end zone, the fans are practically genuflecting. Although many of them weren't even born in 1972, the Immaculate Reception is ESPN's Zapruder film, endlessly replayed and dissected. After the fireworks and "Auld Lang Syne," the fans file out, heads bowed. 
The last time they tore down a ballpark in Pittsburgh, they really tore it down. After the Pirates' final game at Forbes Field in 1970, the fans pried up their seats, stuffed chunks of turf in their pockets, tried to haul the urinal troughs out of the men's rooms. But today they behave as if they'd been invited to the deconsecration of a cathedral.
Which isn't such a surprise. In Pittsburgh, the handshake between sports (particularly football) and religion (particularly Catholicism) is so firm that it can be hard to tell where one hand stops and the other begins. At least a few Steeler fans, thanks to their equally devoted next of kin, had their ashes quietly strewn on the bright green plastic carpet of Three Rivers. 
But it goes beyond that. In a city of a certain size, there is nothing more important than its big-league sports teams -- for revenue, for unity, for self-esteem. Sure, New York gets exercised for a Subway Series and, this week, for a Super Bowl, but it all gets swallowed up a day or two after the fact, when the next spectacle comes along. In a town like Pittsburgh, the conquests live on for years. In a town like Pittsburgh, every victory is a vote for yourself. That's why they love the Steelers so much: the Steelers are them. The same owners for 68 years, only two coaches in the past 31, a tough-minded team that doesn't paste some silly bird or cat on its helmets. It's the steelmaking logo the Steelers wear, and only on one side. (Thrift!) Of course, nobody expected it to become an antique. 
On Super Bowl Sunday, it is worth remembering that somehow, beneath the blizzard of corporate sponsorship and go-go commentary, a football game gets played, and to the 45 people in pads and maybe a million or two back home, a victory means everything, forever. That's why cities like Charlotte and Jacksonville and Phoenix fight so hard to bring a team to town; it's why Cleveland and Baltimore and Pittsburgh fight so hard to keep theirs -- and celebrate every victory as if it might be their last.
Pro football grew up in western Pennsylvania and so did half the National Football League, it seemed. Quarterbacks especially, Unitas and Namath and Montana, but plenty of guys like Mike Ditka, people made for football. Each steel mill fielded its own team; high-school games drew 10,000 spectators. 
In their first 40 years, Art Rooney's Steelers were, with slight exception, dreadful. Only the Steelers could have cut a young Johnny Unitas. One of the Rooney grandkids recalls how embarrassed he was to ride to school in the family car, a Buick they got free for having "Official Car of the Pittsburgh Steelers" painted on the side.
In 1972, however, the year of the Immaculate Reception, the Steelers began a turnaround that would soon produce an unprecedented four Super Bowl titles in six years. "It was like Moses crossing the desert," says Art Rooney Jr., then a team scout. "After 40 years, you're somebody."
Delirium rained down. It helped that Pittsburgh was small enough that you might run into Mean Joe Greene at the supermarket. The stars -- Greene, Franco, Jack Lambert -- were deities; even the kicker had a fan club. Terry Bradshaw, the mouthy young quarterback from Louisiana, he and Pittsburgh didn't always get along * but God, could he throw! On Fridays all over western Pennsylvania, the kids wore black and gold to school. On Saturday nights, priests tripled up their Mass schedule since no one was coming on Sundays. On Monday morning, you'd walk into the hospital and all the old emphysemic steelworkers would still be going on about how the Steel Curtain smothered the Clowns -- that is, the hated Cleveland Browns. And on Sundays! Well, on Sundays, Three Rivers Stadium was the place where anyone who'd ever been made to feel small just for being from Pittsburgh, which was pretty much everyone, finally got to watch his football team beat up any other city foolish enough to send in theirs. During those six years, the Steelers won 45 games at Three Rivers and lost only 6. People painted their entire cars black and gold, without Buick even asking them.
But victory came with a Faustian twist. Just as the Steelers rose, real-life steelers began to lose their jobs by the tens of thousands. So now the team was called upon to do even more: give a downward-spiraling town one thing it could trust, one thing it could be proud of. "You can't put a price tag on how valuable it was to the human spirit here," says Myron Cope, the dean of Pittsburgh sportscasters, whose style might be called Overcaffeinated Cosell. "Wherever people gathered, the Steelers were the dominant topic. It gave people something pleasant to talk about for a change, instead of, 'Where the hell am I going to get work?"'
The steel industry vanished, and the city buckled. "We had a 20-year run of bad news here, the largest population losses per capita of any area in the country," says Tom Murphy, a former seminarian and neighborhood activist who is now the mayor. "Between 1978 and 1985, we lost 150,000 jobs in heavy manufacturing alone." 
So yes, the air is clean -- no longer do office workers have to change their white shirts at midday -- but there aren't so many people around to breathe it. The city is down to about 325,000 residents, less than half its 1950 population, and what's left is graying fast. Allegheny County has the second oldest population in the United States, after Dade; hospitals are closing their obstetrics units. Despite some good news -- boomlets in biotech and e-commerce, a leap in the city's bond rating -- it's hard to hide from the bad: a monstrous debt, high taxes, whispers of bankruptcy.
Only one misery could beat a bankrupt Pittsburgh: a bankrupt Pittsburgh without its sports teams. Although the Penguins haven't won the Stanley Cup in nearly 10 years, and the Steelers and Pirates haven't gone all the way in more than 20, the Pittsburgh newspapers look like local editions of The Sporting News. If you were living in Pittsburgh this fall, you could be forgiven for not knowing there was some kind of problem with the presidential election. On Dec. 8, the Post-Gazette front page ran a quiet little item headlined "Court Takes Up Gore's Appeal"; the rest of the page shouted "MARIO RETURNS." Mario Lemieux, who led the Penguins to two Stanley Cups and then rescued them from bankruptcy by buying part of the team, was coming out of retirement. This was a week before the Steelers' final game at Three Rivers. "How about that -- a resurrection and a burial, all in one week," said Tom Rooney, a Penguins executive and a cousin of the Steeler Rooneys. At Lemieux's first game back, a boy held aloft a sign reading "Our savior has returned to the ice."
Within an exploding sports industry, it is a marvel that a shrinking Rust Belt city has hung onto all three of its major-league teams. As the mayor tells it, this wouldn't be so if Pittsburgh hadn't taken bold action: "The Pirates would already have been gone, the Penguins would have been gone and the Steelers wouldn't have been far behind. And the thought of letting the teams go would have been the final statement that this community had given up."
In the mill towns dotting the three rivers that flow through Pittsburgh, schools and churches and entire neighborhoods have been shutting down. But where the rivers come together, two new stadiums have risen, one for football and one for baseball, at a cost of nearly half a billion dollars (and built from steel shipped in from Texas and Alabama). Until it is dynamited, Three Rivers squats there between them -- Three Stadiums River, they call it. If you filled them all up at once, you could fit half the city of Pittsburgh.
Mayor Murphy got the bad news two weeks before his inauguration in 1994: the Pirates were for sale.
The team was, if nothing else, venerable. In 1903, they played in the first World Series. In 1960, they ended a decades-long losing streak when Bill Mazeroski hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the Yankees in the seventh game of the World Series. Until the Immaculate Reception came along, Mazeroski's home run was the Miracle; fans still gather every Oct. 13 at the old Forbes Field site and listen to the broadcast of Game 7, which always ends the same perfect way.
In their first decade at Three Rivers, the Pirates won two more World Series and, along with the Steelers, had Pittsburgh calling itself the City of Champions. They put together another wonderful team in the early 1990's but couldn't afford to re-sign their best players and have been lousy ever since.
To small-market teams, free agency has been one big kick in the teeth. How could Pittsburgh compete with its big-city, big-media brethren? Like the former steelworkers before them, a great diaspora of former Pirates -- Bonilla, Bonds, Drabek -- spread across the land. And now the team itself might leave.
A buyer came along who promised to keep the Pirates in Pittsburgh, for a price. Kevin McClatchy, the 32-year-old scion of the Sacramento newspaper family, made it clear that the team would need a new stadium. The problem wasn't simply that Three Rivers was graceless, sitting like a giant gray ashtray on the riverside. Or that it was dank in the spring and blistering in summertime, or that its sight lines were terrible, or that it was too cavernous for baseball, or that the Astroturf-and-concrete field made a baseball jump like a Spaldeen -- though all that is true. "Three Rivers isn't physically obsolete," says Mark Schneider, chairman of the city's Stadium Authority. "It's economically obsolete."
It is the whole era of the multipurpose stadium that has proved obsolete. Instead of urban magnets, they became gigantic roadblocks, dead-ending neighborhoods and strangling development. Dual-sport stadiums weren't exactly right for either sport, and the two teams fought over the too-thin revenue streams.
Then in 1992, the Baltimore Orioles opened Oriole Park at Camden Yards. It was a comely ballpark, old-fashioned and newfangled at the same time; it was instantly embraced and widely imitated. Its architect, HOK Sport of Kansas City, became as hot as a dressmaker before the ball. All over the country, baseball teams and their obedient civic partners began plotting intricate, fine-grained downtown ballparks that echoed Camden Yards. Football teams began plotting muscular HOK stadiums that echoed the Colosseum. The idea was that a beautiful single-sport stadium, with luxury suites and a pricey corporate nameplate and restaurants and arcades and shops that could draw customers 365 days a year might allow even a small-market team to make enough money to bring home a championship.
That, at least, is what Pittsburgh is praying for.
The Steelers, and Dan Rooney in particular, were not heartbroken that the Pirates were moving out of Three Rivers. Rooney is the Steeler president and the eldest son of the late Art Rooney Sr., aka the Chief. He is 68, gentlemanly and no-nonsense, and he still hasn't forgotten how, back at Forbes Field, "the Pirates treated us like poor second cousins." 
Of course, that was before the Steelers had won anything, and before pro football was fully reputable. "People thought we'd go outside of town to meet with the other team, decide what the score will be, then play the game," recalls Ed Kiely, the Chief's former aide-de-camp. For years, the Steelers were vagabonds. They played at Forbes Field or Pitt Stadium, kept their offices in a hotel, practiced out at the old city fairgrounds. "Three Rivers was a big deal for us," says Art Rooney Jr., "and in 1970, it was a classy joint."
It would become a shrine. Schoolchildren took field trips to visit the four Super Bowl trophies, mounted in a display case like the bones of a saint. Though far from perfect, Three Rivers had been good to the Steelers. So they had no intention of leaving, provided the place could be modernized.
The first estimate, $75 million, would only buy a minor facelift. Dan Rooney called in HOK Sport for a real renovation. The price: $140 million. "Jeez," Rooney said, "couldn't we get a brand-new stadium for that?" 
Just about then, Rooney made a sobering realization: every other team in the Steelers' division was building a new stadium, each with a gushing revenue stream. Before free agency, the Steelers were masters of an N.F.L. trick called Bottom 7/Top 7: a payroll among the seven lowest in the league but a won-loss record among the top seven. Lately, they'd lost the ability to do that. So Rooney asked HOK to draw up plans for a new stadium, which would end up costing about $275 million. The Steelers were willing to pay a substantial share, but the city would have to contribute heavily. If not, there was a sweetheart offer from an outlying county. And the city also had to come up with something for the Pirates, fast. 
An 11-county referendum was put together to raise money for the new stadiums. The voters in those old mill towns didn't seem to get it. Why is the city tearing down a perfectly good stadium? Aren't the Rooneys and the McClatchys and the ballplayers rich enough to build their own stadiums? And if there's no money to clean up our brownfields and fix our roads, why should we pay for Pittsburgh's stadiums? 
Although Pittsburgh proper voted in its favor, the referendum failed miserably. And so it was that Mayor Murphy and various Steeler and Pirate and corporate emissaries went to Harrisburg to tell the State Legislature that the teams of Pittsburgh are a Pennsylvania treasure and that the city might go extinct without them. 
The Legislature came up with the money. Now comes the hard sell, at home. "We're doing this very unpopular thing with the voters -- You voted against this, but we're going to do it anyway,"' says Murphy. "But we'd been managing 30 years of decline, and I decided -- no guts, no glory."
Murphy's reach for glory may cost him his job. He is walking a fine line between boosterism and overspending, all while he is up for re-election. If ousted, Murphy -- whose father worked 51 years in the steel mills -- might take comfort in the folk legend of Joe Magarac. He was Pittsburgh's answer to Paul Bunyan: the mightiest steelman ever, made of steel himself. When he could no longer work, Joe leapt into a ladle of molten ore, and he was rolled out as a shiny steel girder bound for . . . the Capitol Building in Washington.
By 8 A.M. on Dec. 16, the deconsecration of Three Rivers is under way. It begins, as always, in the parking lot, with sausage hoagies and Iron City beer. Steeler fans will tell you that they invented tailgating -- as well as the DEE-FENSE chant. They will also tell you how, back in the day, visiting teams needed a police escort to get from the bus into the stadium.
But today is a mellow day. Although the Steelers beat the Redskins, 24-3, neither team will make the playoffs, and the game is without much consequence. It is afterward, when the former Steelers are introduced, that all the emotion spills out. Their stories are civic myth by now: Rocky Bleier, the most unlikely Steeler hero, who returned from Vietnam with shrapnel in his foot and willed his way into the lineup; Jack Lambert, the headhunting middle linebacker -- so mean he even hates himself," as one teammate used to say; Frenchy Fuqua, who, off the field, wore platform heels containing live goldfish and, on the field, was a key figure in the Immaculate Reception; and Franco himself, whose fan club, Franco's Italian Army, was joined, in all seriousness, by Frank Sinatra.
Franco Harris, like a great many former Steelers, stayed on in Pittsburgh after football. There was more success waiting for them here: as investment bankers, coal brokers, restaurateurs, broadcasters. They had done great things for the city, and the city was eager to pay them back. As they take the field now, some trim and some paunchy, they smile -- not with the gloat of fresh victory but with the appreciation of men whose second halves were set up so well by their first. 
Within 36 hours of this great farewell, Three Rivers was under assault. Patches of Astroturf were peeled off and sent, like skin grafts, to city parks and Little League batting cages. Some of the turf, along with the stadium's seats, kitchen gear and maintenance equipment, were auctioned off at Mellon Arena, where the Penguins play (and which will probably also soon be razed). Eight thousand people showed up. The going rate for a set of six seats was $2,100; one woman planned to install a pair at her husband's grave site. Some items were not for sale, including the Steelers' wooden lockers, which were taken apart panel by panel, like a church fresco, to be reassembled in the new stadium's Great Hall, a two-story Steeler museum and "fan celebration area."
The rest of Three Rivers will be turned to rubble. Buildings come and go. There is nothing permanent about them except what happened inside. Pittsburgh understands this. It is not uncommon to hear people in Pittsburgh mark their life events -- a wedding anniversary, the birth of their first child -- with a Super Bowl.
It's been too long, of course. But for all the absurdities and inequities of modern sport, the game itself is what becomes an institution, one of the few things these days that transcends both economics and concrete.
David Bianchi also understands this. He is from Syracuse, and he runs the demolition company that will bring down Three Rivers. He doesn't mean to be disrespectful of its legacy, but he is, frankly, unintimidated. "We just shot four high-rise structures in Philly," he says, "three 11's and a 15." Meaning 11 and 15 stories high. The implosion of Three Rivers, he says, will look like a circular deck of cards, falling in both directions, starting at the point where it stands just 65 feet from the new football stadium. It should take about 19 seconds. "You've got to realize," he says, "people think this is a monster, but it's not. It's 70,000 yards of concrete, but as far as height, integrity, distance, this is nothing."

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Setting His Tale Of Love Found In a City Long Lost

BYLINE:  By LESLIE CAMHI; Leslie Camhi, a writer and critic based in New York, writes about film, art and books.

 BODY:
ALMOST nothing remains of the Hong Kong neighborhood where Wong Kar-wai grew up: the narrow alleyways, cramped apartments and crowded noodle stalls where elegant men and women tried to recreate the cosmopolitan lives they'd led in Shanghai, before Mao Zedong's revolution.
 His most recent film, "In the Mood for Love," is set in 1962 amid Hong Kong's exiled Shanghai community, but Mr. Wong shot most of the film in Bangkok; the one or two Hong Kong locations he used during filming two years ago have already vanished as the city continually rebuilds itself. 
 And in the film itself, very little remains of the miles of footage he amassed over a 15-month shoot. On the editing table, Mr. Wong cut out most of the story, leaving only a fevered dream of passion and a celluloid love letter to a time and place that is lost. 
In the past decade, Mr. Wong, 42, has emerged as Hong Kong's leading director. His seven features, from "As Tears Go By" (1988) to "Happy Together" (1997), blend sophisticated editing, pop cultural references, urban anomie, a surreal visual sense and frequently absurdist characters. His is an artificial nighttime universe where Hong Kong call girls wear blonde wigs and cackle hilariously, where hit men take the bus home from shootouts and run into old high school acquaintances. Yet despite their maker's hipster image, the films are laced with the melancholy of displaced people and missed experiences.
"I think it's because of my background," Mr. Wong said in an interview in New York last fall, when "In the Mood for Love" was shown at the New York Film Festival. He was born in Shanghai and moved with his parents to Hong Kong when he was 5, joining a wave of immigrants fleeing Communist China. "In 1997, just before Hong Kong's hand over to China, we had to reregister our identity cards," he added. "And I realized that though I've been staying in Hong Kong for 33 years, it still feels like a permanent vacation, a transition that lasts forever. It's weird and fun. We were always prepared, as kids, that we would move on, to somewhere else or back to Shanghai. There was no sense that you belonged to this place or city." 
"In the Mood for Love," which opens on Friday, finds Mr. Wong in a more contemplative mode, reaching back to childhood emotions and sensations to recapture the grace and mystery of a world that's disappeared. As the film opens, Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) and Mr. Chow (Tony Leung Chiu-wai, who won best actor last year at the Cannes International Film Festival for his performance) rent rooms in adjacent apartments. Mrs. Chan works as a secretary in a shipping office; Mr. Chow is a journalist. Their spouses (whom we never see) are frequently absent; her husband travels regularly to Japan for business, and his wife often works late as a hotel receptionist. In wordless refrains set to the haunting strains of a waltz by the Japanese composer Umebayashi Shigeru, we watch them joining their neighbors' mah-jongg parties, passing each other on the stairs, descending to the local noodle stand for solitary meals or standing lost in thought.
"Compared to the local Cantonese population, these people from Shanghai are very sophisticated and are considered very snobbish," Mr. Wong said. "They live in their own neighborhood, with their own language, music, food, magazines and cinemas. They never treat Hong Kong as a hometown. They think they will go back to Shanghai when things get better. At the same time, they recreate a small Shanghai in Hong Kong. It's like building a dream there."
One evening, Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow meet for dinner at a restaurant. As Nat King Cole croons a Latin love song on the soundtrack, they gradually admit the truth that each has come to realize: their spouses are having an affair together. The secret, once shared, unites them in a complex dance of seduction and betrayal. Trying to understand and put themselves in the place of the adulterers, they begin a new relation, layered with passion and regret for all that has come before.
To help recreate the ambience of an era in which discretion vied with the lack of privacy and mainland traditions kept company with the fragmenting forces of modernity, Mr. Wong hired a chef to cook Shanghai dishes for the cast and crew and engaged retired Hong Kong radio announcers, now in their 70's, to record radio programs for the soundtrack featuring bits of Mandarin pop and Chinese opera. He was also inspired by newspaper writers of the period whose columns on subjects ranging from martial arts and food to news and pornography were transformed into "40-cent novels." Quotations from them frame the story.
The art director William Chang Suk-Ping designed the film's unique look, using overlapping textures and luminous colors to create an intense concentration of sensation and experience and controlling every visual detail, from settings and props to costumes, hair and makeup. He was also the film's editor. (For their work on the film, Mr. Chang and the cinematographers Christopher Doyle and Mark Li Ping-bin were awarded the Grand Prix de la Technique, the technical grand prize, at Cannes.)
Transforming Ms. Cheung into the impeccably clad and coiffed Mrs. Chan required more than four hours of daily preparation. In each scene she wears a different cheongsam -- a form-fitting, classic Chinese dress -- cut from vibrant floral or geometric fabrics (often imported from the West) that harmonize or clash with the decor's wallpaper and curtains or echo the more subtle patterns of rain on pavement. (Mr. Chang cites Jacques Demy's extravagantly colored 1964 musical "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" as a stylistic influence.) The dresses tell a story of Western influence and Eastern tradition, sensuality and reserve, restraint and vibrant expression.
"The dress is very constraining, yet it's also very revealing," Mr. Chang said by telephone from Hong Kong. "The colors I am using are very vivid, to contrast with the characters' restrained emotions. These contradictions are also in the lines they speak. Everything that Maggie and Tony say to each other can also mean its opposite. Are they rehearsing their love, or is it real? It's quite complex."
With his choice of locations, all angles and corners, Mr. Chang wanted to suggest the feeling of characters hemmed in and spied upon by ever-present neighbors. "We're always seeing them through doors, windows, or corridors," he said. "There's no direct contact with the characters. We're looking at things from afar. It gives you space to think and feel rather than just identifying with the actors." It also lends the whole film an aura of recollection.
"In the Mood for Love" (the English title comes from the classic pop standard "I'm in the Mood for Love") ends in 1966, when the increasing repression of the Cultural Revolution in China and anticolonial riots against the British in Hong Kong forced members of the Shanghai community to confront their choices. "The wealthy ones moved on to the United States or Europe," Mr. Wong said. "The ones who couldn't realized that their stay in Hong Kong was no longer temporary." (The film handles these political details with a light touch: a coda shot at Angkor Wat in Cambodia in which images of that magnificent ruin, to the sound of Michael Galasso's mournful score, suddenly expose the characters full sense of loss.)
Mr. Wong's family was among those who remained behind. Trained as graphic designer, he got his start as a television production assistant during the first years of local broadcasting in the 1970's. Later, he spent a decade writing film scripts before directing "As Tears Go By," a wistful gangster movie in which Ms. Cheung plays the young thug's love interest, a girl who lives far from the city's mean streets on a remote vacation island.
"I sometimes treat space as a main character in my films," Mr. Wong said. " 'Chungking Express' is about a Hong Kong street corner. The same with 'In the Mood for Love.' I had to know the apartments and the streets intimately. They are the silent witness to the whole story."
He works regularly with a small group of collaborators, including Mr. Chang, Ms. Cheung, Mr. Leung and Mr. Doyle, whose long familiarity allows him the freedom to think with his eye and ear. He never starts shooting with a finished script; rather, as with "In the Mood for Love," the characters, dialogue and story evolve in response to actors and locations.
"At the beginning, we were given a four-page short story by a Japanese writer from the 1960's, about an affair between two neighbors," Ms. Cheung said. "There was not a lot of detail. Then, during every hair and makeup session, we would receive a still-warm fax with some lines of dialogue to be shot later that day, and which Kar-wai had clearly written that morning."
"Sometimes we would shoot the same scenes with the dialogues between myself and Tony reversed," she said. "Or we would film the same dialogues but on a different set," as if Mr. Wong were trying out every possible variant of desire and emotion. Illnesses, the Asian financial crisis and prior commitments interrupted the filming, which dragged on for more than a year, testing everyone's patience. Yet the result is Mr. Wong's most personal film, fusing image and sound in a work of pure memory.
"Maybe that's why it took so long," Mr. Wong said. "I didn't want to let go of it."
Mr. Wong's next film, "2046," is set in the future. "In 1997 the Chinese government promised Hong Kong 50 years of an unchanging political and economic system," he explained "The number 2046 represents the last year of that promise. We wanted to make a film about promises, and whether anything remains unchanged for that long in life."
"In the Mood for Love" began with a waltz; "Happy Together," his previous film, was inspired by the tango; "2046" is based on opera, and will include segments of "Carmen," "Madama Butterfly," "Tannhauser." 
"Opera is about promises, betrayals and myths," Mr. Wong said. "The form has been here for hundreds of years -- much longer than 50. And these topics never change."
Meanwhile, his hometown remains a city in perpetual motion.
"Every night on the local TV station, after 1 a.m. they show old Hong Kong films until morning," Mr. Wong said. "As a student, I always stayed up late to watch them. So I always wanted to put some place in my films, a corridor, a restaurant or a street, because I knew it would be gone soon. Things change so fast here. Maybe somebody watching my films at 2 in the morning will see something of what Hong Kong was like in the year 2000." Or in 1962.

Finding Their Refuge in the Segregated South

BYLINE:  By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN; Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of "Jew vs. Jew: The Struggle for the Soul of American Jewry."

 BODY:
LATE one afternoon in the spring of 1996, three documentary filmmakers pulled their station wagon off a two-lane road in North Carolina and up to a nursing home, their third or fourth such stop of the day. One of the trio presented himself at the front desk and asked the receptionist, "Do you have a resident named Ernst Manasse?" She consulted a roster and pointed down a hallway.
 In a room at its end the visitor found a man in a wheelchair, hospital band on his wrist, skin flecked with age spots, head drawn turtle-like into his chest. "Are you Professor Manasse?" the filmmaker said, and the man answered yes in a German accent that was the ultimate confirmation. 
 Within minutes, the visitor, a producer named Steven Fischler, summoned his partner, Joel Sucher, and an assistant director, Martin Toub. They set up their equipment in the nursing home's sun room and began to question Mr. Manasse about his life's work. A few months later, before they had the chance to conduct a second interview, the professor died. 
But that single encounter proved pivotal in the film that those three men and the director Lori Cheatle would complete nearly four years later, "From Swastika to Jim Crow," a chronicle of German Jewish scholars who were ousted from their universities by the Nazi regime and wound up teaching at black colleges in the American South. "This was a different world" is how Mr. Manasse put it during his sole session with the filmmakers, recalling his arrival at North Carolina Central College in Durham in 1939, where he taught German, Latin and philosophy. "It was a little country college. But it was my salvation."
Now the story of the brotherhood and mutual need that linked the persecuted German Jews to their students in the segregated South will open PBS's commemoration of Black History Month on Thursday night. It bears witness to a chapter of Jewish and African-American history that has remained almost unknown except to those professors and students it directly affected, and might have gone to the grave with Mr. Manasse and other essential figures.
"We've always been interested in these little stories, these overlooked pieces of history," Mr. Sucher said in a recent interview in Manhattan. "My God, Jewish professors at black colleges. I knew right off there had to be drama to these stories. My only problem in approaching these stories was whether they were too good to be true."
Indeed, as the child of Holocaust survivors and as a filmmaker who has dealt often with social issues and radical politics, Mr. Sucher keenly appreciated how combustible any effort to espouse a special relationship between Jews and African-Americans, based on each group's experience of persecution and genocide, can be. A documentary in the early 1990's, "The Liberators," described the liberation of the Buchenwald and Dachau death camps by black soldiers -- only to have the claim, inspired by a passionate desire to create a black-Jewish connection, unmasked as false. (Black GI's did liberate another camp, Gunskirchen.) Jews and African-Americans have argued bitterly about whether the term Holocaust belongs uniquely to the Nazi extermination or applies as well to the slave trade.
One of the indirect catalysts for "From Swastika to Jim Crow," in fact, was an especially noxious denunciation of Jews made at a black college. A few weeks after a Howard University law student in early 1994 led a cheering crowd of 2,000 in denouncing Jewish control of banking and media, among other classic anti-Semitic canards, a German Jew who had taught political science there decades earlier wrote a letter to The New York Times pleading, "The helping hand stretched out by black colleges and black scholars should not be forgotten."
Mr. Sucher happened to notice the letter. He telephoned its writer, John Herz, who lived near the filmmaker's office in Westchester County and was by then almost 90 and so hard of hearing that he initially thought Mr. Sucher was trying to sell him film. Mr. Herz steered the producer to Gabrielle Edgcomb, the author of an obscure 1993 book titled "From Swastika to Jim Crow: Refugee Scholars at Black Colleges." And from both Mr. Herz and Ms. Edgcomb, the documentary team soon realized that the letter may have been unduly optimistic in one regard: to forget something, you have to have known it in the first place.
Of the 1,200 Jewish professors driven from German universities in the mid-1930's, the most prominent, including Albert Einstein, were welcomed in the elite reaches of American academe. Others, Hannah Arendt among them, founded the University in Exile, which became the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. But about 50 of the uprooted, facing a Depression economy and discrimination in hiring at Ivy League schools, landed in such farflung black colleges as Tougaloo in Mississippi and Talladega in Alabama. There they lived what Ms. Edgcomb calls in the film "double exile," sundered both from Germany and from the refugee community and regarded in the South, by whites and blacks alike, as not quite Caucasian.
AGERMAN Jewish refugee herself, Ms. Edgcomb had first heard of these scholars while active in the civil rights movement and devoted 12 years to researching her book. It was published by a tiny press and ignored by reviewers. When Mr. Sucher and Mr. Fischler first met with her in 1995 to begin developing the documentary, she warned them, "You'll never get the money to do it." While she readily passed along addresses and phone numbers for some refugee scholars to be interviewed, she said of the rest: "I don't know where they are. You'll never find them."
Patching together a series of small and moderate grants from foundations interested in Jewish history, the filmmakers launched their search. After Ms. Edgcomb died in 1997, friends of hers raised about $12,000 at a screening of a 25-minute segment of unedited film. But it took a $150,000 infusion in 1998 from the Independent Television Service, an organization established by Congress to support programs that "involve creative risks and address the needs of underserved audiences," for the hourlong documentary to be completed in late 1999.
Over their years of fitful research, the filmmakers tracked down four living scholars and the surviving spouses or children of several others. Ms. Cheatle, brought on as director, unearthed still photographs, home movies and television news footage from archival sources and personal collections. One of the most significant personages in the finished film, the sociologist Ernst Borinski, died in 1983, after a 37-year career at Tougaloo, and exists in the film only through such materials.
The filmmakers also found a number of former students, now professors themselves, who spoke admiringly of their unlikely mentors. William Jackson, now the chairman of the German department at the University of Virginia, recalled Manasse pushing him to apply (successfully) for a Fulbright scholarship. Calvin Hernton, a professor emeritus from Oberlin, recounted how Fritz Pappenheim, his professor at Talladega, arranged for him to meet Langston Hughes.
In their classrooms and the surrounding towns, the refugee professors attacked segregation at some peril to their tenuous place in the South. Mr. Pappenheim, a socialist, had to testify before a Congressional committee investigating supposed Communist subversion in the civil rights movement. Two faculty members at Talladega, Lore and Donald Rasmussen, were charged with inciting to riot for eating in a "colored only" restaurant.
AT the same time, the black college campuses offered the only genuine community the refugees knew in America. Local whites considered the Jews everything from Marxist agitators to Nazi spies, while blacks tended to view them as kindred souls, even racially. Black neighbors taught one of the refugees how to cook. As a Howard professor, Ralph Bunche assigned Mr. Herz to write about Nazism for the Journal of Negro Education. When Viktor Lowenfeld, an art professor at Hampton, learned that his family had been murdered in Nazi death camps, he confided it to his student protege, John Thomas Biggers.
"This notion of man's inhumanity to man was not foreign to African-American citizens," Clint Wilson, now a journalism professor at Howard, says in the film. "So, yes, there was not so much shock as there was empathy. Because when you've been through slavery, you're not shocked by anything that people will do."

Timing the Market on Tuition

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I HAVE been a long-term investor for, well, almost as long as I can remember. The strategy has been beaten into me ever since I had to cash out my first investment, a growth mutual fund at the old E. F. Hutton, after less than a year. My wife and I, newly married, had wanted to buy a condo.
 "It's a mistake to sell now," the Hutton adviser said of my $10,000 investment, practically begging me to reconsider. "You should hold on to it." 
 I couldn't, and I ended up losing about $2,000 because of a market decline and sales commissions, although the condo was grand. Considering that this happened in the early 1980's, about the time the bull market started its run, I can only imagine what that $10,000 might be worth today.
I have been a reluctant seller ever since, stubbornly holding onto stocks like Coca-Cola, AT&T and Microsoft as they have fallen because of my faith in the long term. But suddenly, the long term isn't so far away. The eldest of my four children, Marian, 13, will enter high school in the fall, putting her a mere four years away from college. Right behind her are my three sons, all waiting to show me that paying for the condo was a minor skirmish.
So the question for me is, is it time to sell? Should I pull money out of the stock market and put it safely aside for college? Although stocks have always risen in the long run, no one can guarantee how they will behave in the short term -- just look at today's volatile market. And four years sure feels like the short term. I have enough now to pay for Marian, although much work must still be done for the boys. If I take her money off the table, one of my financial goals will have been met -- and that, I have to say, would be a big relief.
But selling also has its risks. If I sell and stocks rise, how much return, which I could use for the boys, will I be giving up just to make Marian's money safe? Years from now, I don't want to have to say, "Sorry boys, your sister spent it all."
David G. Speck, managing director of First Union Securities in Alexandria, Va., and author of "College Savings Rx: Investment Prescriptions for a Healthy College Fund" (Octameron Associates, 1998), told me not to panic. Time, he said, was still on my side.
"You think, 'My God, my child starts college in four years and I need $100,000,' " he said. "But you do not need all four years of tuition at the beginning of the first year. It's not four years from now -- it's four to eight. In the world of investing, that's a long time."
He said I should plan two years ahead, not four. So in Marian's junior year of high school, I should take out enough money to pay for her freshman year of college. When she's a high school senior, I should raise the money for her second year of college -- and so on. 
"I don't think it is imprudent to move out of the market if you know that you need those assets if you have a two-year horizon," he said. "You may miss a market bump, but you don't have to worry about paying Year One tuition."
Evan H. Snapper, senior manager for personal financial counseling at Ernst & Young in Stamford, Conn., said I should be even more aggressive in saving. He recommended that I put away freshman and sophomore tuition now.
"A long-term investor is out seven years," he said. "If you have a seven-year time frame, you have time to ride out the downturns. With a four-year time frame, historically, you don't have enough time to earn back your principal. If the goal is met, get it off the table. If you're real close, there is no reason to take additional risk."
Like Mr. Speck, he said that I should then move year by year. "For the third and fourth year, keep it in the equity market, but don't get crazy with it," he said. "Figure out what growth you need and build your portfolio around that."
BOTH financial advisers suggested that any money I move out now be reinvested in cash or in relatively safe vehicles like Treasury bills and municipal bonds, so that inflation doesn't eat away at the money.
"Don't blow it at the goal line," Mr. Snapper summed up.
That all seemed fine. Then Marian told me that she has her heart set on Yale -- a worthy aim, but an expensive one that will certainly move the goal line, and my decision to sell, much further away.

HEADLINE: Giving It The Old College Try; 
Local Universities Struggle to Raise Their Profile

BYLINE:  By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
WHEN advertisements for a certain small liberal arts college in Garden City described Harvard University as "the Adelphi of Massachusetts," they implied that the two schools shared high standards and goals common to elite liberal arts institutions.
 The 1989 ad campaign, which cost nearly $2 million, was a soaring act of hubris for Adelphi University, which would never be confused with Harvard if one compares laureates, curriculum, valedictorians, alumni or many of the other latinate catchwords of higher education. The ads stopped running in 1990. 
 But the campaign raised another question -- why was there no Harvard of Long Island? Why was there no premier university in Nassau or Suffolk County, a place where the best of the Island's graduating high school seniors, a group with a national reputation for high academic achievement and aspirations, could attend with enthusiasm, without ever having to drive through a borough of New York City? 
A dozen years later, the question is still valid, though there are signs that some of Long Island's schools, particularly those focusing on science and technology, are gaining. A 1997 study of research universities that ranks them according to research grants won per professor, among other criteria, ranked the State University of New York at Stony Brook third among the country's public research universities, behind only the University of California at Berkeley and University of California at Santa Barbara. In another burst of immodesty, a Stony Brook professor proclaimed his school "the Berkeley of the east."
But the Island's overall higher-education profile remains low, a fact local college presidents often ascribe to reputation lagging behind performance. That reputation has repercussions off-campus -- for years, Long Island has suffered a brain drain, with the top high school seniors heading to the mainland as fast as fingerling salmon swim to the big wide ocean.
Probably 60 percent leave for college, estimates Matthew Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, and once gone are more likely to launch their careers off-Island. Each Long Islander thus lost is "almost irreplaceable," Mr. Crosson said, in an economy where local corporate recruiters have been struggling for years to find enough college grads to fill all their job openings.
The local colleges the departing students shun are left competing for the students who stay: commuters, older students, those with lower SAT scores. Those schools are not particularly choosy. None of the larger four-year colleges on Long Island accepts fewer than 55 percent of its applicants, and SUNY-Stony Brook, Hofstra University and the New York Institute of Technology report that the average SAT scores of their incoming freshmen have risen to 1,158, 1,103 and 1,100, respectively, no great shakes when the national average is 1,019.
"The premier students traditionally leave it to go elsewhere," Vince Passaro, director of communications at Adelphi, said of Long Island. "There's a whole combination of factors. Some of them have to do with getting away from home, or the traditional elite institutions and where they are located." 
One explanation for that: the colleges on Long Island are virtual infants compared to those on the mainland. "Adelphi is the oldest college on Long Island and it's only 105 years old," Mr. Passaro said.
In fact, of the 18 four-year colleges in Nassau and Suffolk counties, 12 are less than 50 years old, scant time for lofty intellectual traditions to take root.
Matthew Goldstein served as president of Adelphi for barely a year before leaving Long Island in 1999 to become chancellor of the City University of New York.
"At Adelphi we all lamented that probably the most able students were leaving the Island because they had options," he said in a recent phone interview. "It's probably a good thing for them to experience a new environment. Long Island is sort of an insular place as well, and there are people who feel very comfortable in that environment."
But that does not account for the bright students who would rather stay close to home but feel they must go elsewhere for the best education they qualify for.
One college official who asked not to be identified said he sees a "very disturbing focus" on the 100 top-ranked universities and liberal arts colleges in the country.
"None of the schools on Long Island are in that group, so they're left to forage with the rest of this vast middle," he said. "And as a result each one has to forge its identity. At the same time there is a deep, long-bred tradition of students looking elsewhere instead of here." 
Edward Guiliano, president of the New York Institute of Technology, said, "I think all of the colleges on Long Island need to better define their niche." 
N.Y.I.T., which has an Old Westbury campus, seems to have succeeded in niche-finding. "No other college on Long Island has a school of architecture and design," Dr. Guiliano said. "We also have a world-class reputation in computer graphics. We offer a great deal that the other colleges do not and so students self-select our school and programs. What we don't have is a football team."
There are many historical reasons for colleges in Nassau and Suffolk counties to suffer in comparison to those on the mainland, said James Axtell, a humanities professor at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va.
"The place wasn't terribly well developed until fairly late in the 20th century," he said of Long Island. "It's off the beaten track. Colleges usually grow up where there's a center of commerce or banking or intellectual activities or population, and there are none of those. There's lots of population out there, but it's basically diffused in bedroom communities, and they all go to New York, which is where their kids go to college."
But the suburbs of Philadelphia, for example, have a handful of elite liberal arts colleges. Kenneth T. Jackson, author of "Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States" (1985, Oxford University Press), detected a difference between the two regions.
"Long Island is old in the sense that people were there in the 17th century, but as a suburban area, where people commuted, it's a little more recent," he said. "The North Shore was where the wealthy lived in summer estates and weekend houses, but it was not suburban the way the Main Line was. Maybe that makes a difference, too."
New York's state university system was slower to develop than some of the flagship state schools in the Midwest, leaving Long Island without a set of powerhouse public universities. SUNY-Stony Brook, the best of the three state universities on the Island (and by many measures the best overall), was founded only in 1957, making it a young pup by collegiate standards.
Historically in the East, colonial-era colleges "established a model of private higher education that was superb, and the Midwest, when people began moving in the 19th century, didn't have that, so states picked up responsibility for that earlier in the West than in the East," said Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, president of the Spencer Foundation in Chicago, which focuses on education research.
Other factors make Long Island a natural place for higher learning, said Jamie Ferrare, a senior consultant at the Academic Search Consultation Service in Washington, which has conducted searches for several Long Island university presidents recently.
"One of the attractions is its proximity to New York City, yet you don't have to be in the city," he said. 
The suburbs can be a draw for students trying to avoid the crime and dirt of city living, said Robert A. Scott, the president of Adelphi since July. "In addition to the beauty of the campus and the beauty and safety of Garden City, parents especially appreciate the pristine, safe town we're in," he said, noting it is only 45 minutes by train to Manhattan. 
And Shirley Strum Kenny, president of SUNY-Stony Brook, said that Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory are wonderful resources for her students.
"They form an intellectual nucleus that is very important, not just for graduate students but for undergraduates as well," she said. 
But it has not always been easy to sell students on her school, which is known for having all the architectural charm of a Soviet apartment block, as Dr. Kenny found out when she arrived on campus six years ago.
"When I first came here I thought this place is so ugly," she said. "There was no sense of center to the university, and all the doors seemed to lead to parking lots." Early in her tenure she helped create an academic mall, a cobblestoned area with a brook, fountain, and benches where students could sit, read and socialize. More improvements are afoot, with a new Asian cultural center under construction.
"I'm very convinced that the quality of space is very related to the quality of education," Dr. Kenny said. "It needs to be respectful of students, and it needs to say you're important, that learning is important." 
In the meantime, she has overseen the $81 million rehabilitation of all 26 dormitories on campus. The dorms needed the facelift because, as she puts it, "they were not respectful of students."
Of Stony Brook's 6,161 full-time undergraduate students, 52 percent live on-campus. Other local universities have been trying to boost their percentages of resident students, with Adelphi moving from 600 resident students two years ago to 869 this year, with 50 or 60 more rooms planned. Hofstra is adding an honors college to attract more qualified students, and has also made improvements to the campus to encourage commuters to spend more time in the academic environment.
Reflecting a national trend, applications for a number of Long Island colleges are rising, along with the caliber of applicants, many college officials say. And lots of the students who accept spots at the schools are pleased with their decision.
Jennifer Morley, 21, of Newington, Conn., said none of her high school classmates applied to schools on Long Island, while she turned down an acceptance at Smith College to attend Hofstra. She said she wanted a school with strong academic, dance and communications programs.
"My peers were all very liberal arts-oriented," she said as she lunched on some rice cakes recently with other members of the dance program. "They thought it was a step down for me. I know it was, to some degree, academically, but by the same token, I liked the breadth of what was offered here."
Maria Corso, 19, was likewise happy attending Adelphi. "I've been wanting to go here as long as I can remember," said Ms. Corso, who was registering recently as a transfer student from Nassau Community College. She finds it convenient to commute from home in East Rockaway.
"I can work and do all the things I need to do," she said. "I don't get the college experience of living on my own, being independent, but I'm not really interested in that." Most of her high school classmates went away to college, she said.
Anjuli Bova, 20, chose to go to Hofstra even though she was accepted at Boston University. "I don't know if I chickened out, I just decided to come here," said Ms. Bova, a dance student from Bellmore. "I regret sometimes not going away. I've missed the whole dorm atmosphere. But I love living here. It's close to the city, and the beach, and dance classes in the city."
Andrene Bennett, a 17-year-old Hofstra freshman from West Hempstead, said she was more attracted to the suburbs than to an urban school. "I already knew where all the shopping malls are, and the best places to eat, so I don't have to get to know an area all over again," she said. 
Dr. Goldstein of CUNY believes that Hofstra is probably the local college most likely to see more students applying from out of state.
"To attract students from all over, you need activities and programs to draw those students. Hofstra is probably the best on the Island to provide that environment, and serve as a magnet," he said. "I'm not sure if it really has a national reach and can be nationally competitive. If you really want to become a national draw, you have to do the kinds of things so people will say it is really worth the effort and expense and risk of going to a place they may not have thought of before."
But Professor Jackson said that with the right infusion of funds, other schools could gain national recognition. "Maybe one of the Long Island institutions will become such an elite institution in the 21st century -- Hofstra, Adelphi or Stony Brook," he said. "Sometimes one big gift can jump-start a place. A gift of $100 million could make a big difference."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME; 
Replacing Windows to Save Heat

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
HERE is a simple, three-step test to determine whether it is possible to cut your home heating bills by replacing your existing windows:
 1. Stand in front of one of the windows. 
 2. Draw back the curtain.
3. Look at the window. 
If what you are looking at is an old-fashioned wood-framed window with a single sheet of glass, the answer is almost certainly "yes."
In fact, energy experts say, older windows are one of the most significant sources of heat loss in the home. And now, with home heating bills at near-record highs, replacing drafty old windows with new energy-efficient models is beginning to make more and more sense for many homeowners.
"There are basically two types of window replacement options," said Jennifer Grove, marketing manager for Pella Windows and Doors, a window manufacturer based in Pella, Iowa. "One would be a full-frame replacement," she said. This is needed when both the window and the existing frame must be replaced -- usually because the frame itself is rotted or otherwise damaged.
The other option -- replacement of just the window while leaving the existing frame in place -- is more common, less expensive and easier to accomplish.
"What we're talking about is a replacement window unit that is custom-sized to fit the existing opening," Ms. Grove said, explaining that the windows are individually manufactured to measurements provided by the homeowner. "You don't have to disturb any of the interior walls or woodwork to install them, and it's so simple to do that do-it-yourselfers can usually do it themselves."
Ms. Grove said that installing a Pella Precision Fit replacement window requires the removal of only the wood strips that hold the windows in place. Once those strips are removed, the original windows can be taken out of the frame and replaced with the new window assembly.
"You can get our wood replacement windows for about the same price you would pay for vinyl replacements," she said, adding that Pella's Precision Fit wood windows range in price from about $300 to $550, including installation. 
Brian Ciechanowski, the owner of Tri-Pane Installations, a replacement window contractor based in Farmingdale, N.Y., said homeowners who want vinyl replacement windows -- which are popular because they never have to be painted -- should be aware that not all vinyl windows are created equal. 
"Buying a window is a little like buying a car," Mr. Ciechanowski said. "You have economy, midpriced and luxury models."
The "economy" model vinyl window sash and frame assembly, he said, is generally held together with screws. Such windows are often advertised for as little as $169 installed. "It's not a very good window, though, because after a while, the parts start to separate," he said.
The midpriced model, which costs about $225 to $275, uses screws to hold together the frame, but employs a welding process to construct the sash -- the casing around the window glass itself. And the top-of-the-line vinyl replacement window, he said, uses welded seams for both the frame and sash, making the entire assembly more sturdy and resilient. 
Virtually all replacement windows sold today, he said, are at least double-glazed, meaning that there are two panes of glass encasing an insulating area of "dead air" between them. 
And the better windows contain energy-saving features like foam-filled frames, "low-emissivity" coatings -- which prevent heat loss from inside the house while protecting furniture and furnishings from the effects of ultraviolet light from the outside -- and argon gas instead of just "dead air" in the space between panes.
"Our fully welded windows run from $300 and up," Mr. Ciechanowski said, adding that the energy-saving features can add another $75 per window.
One way that homeowners can judge the quality of a particular replacement window is by using a rating system developed by the National Fenestration Rating Council, a not-for-profit testing organization based in Washington.
"When it comes to the energy performance of windows, the N.F.R.C. is basically the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval," said Leonard Greenberger, a spokesman for the organization. The council's ratings on hundreds of windows are available on its Web site at www.nfrc.org, and they are also on stickers that are placed on any windows that have been tested.
Mr. Greenberger said that while the council bases its ratings on various parameters of window performance, the most useful rating is the window's "U-value."
"The U-value measures how good a window is at keeping heat inside a home," he said, explaining that the lower the U-value, the better the window.
"The very best windows have a U-value as low as 0.15," he said, adding that the average U-value for a good replacement window is about 0.45 and the least efficient models have a U-value of 1 and higher.
Another important rating provided by the council is what is known as the "solar heat gain coefficient." 
"That tells you how much solar heat is coming into the house through the window," he said, adding that the coefficient ranges from 0.085 to 0.05. "The higher the number, the better the window is at keeping solar heat out."
Mr. Greenberger pointed out that since solar heat gain would be considered a benefit to homeowners in colder northern climates, windows with a lower solar heat gain coefficient would generally be considered preferable to those with a higher rating. The opposite would apply, however, in hot southern climates where heat from the sun is best kept outside.
For those who want the ultimate in energy efficiency when buying replacement windows, the so-called superwindow may be just the thing.
"The very best window out there is a triple-glazed double-soft-coat low-e window with two layers of krypton gas," said Gerald Damora, the owner of Morris Window and Siding, in Randolph, N.J.
Mr. Damora explained that with a triple-glazed window there are three separate pieces of glass that create two insulating dead-air pockets. Those spaces are then filled with krypton gas -- which is heavier than argon and thus better at insulating.
"That gives you a U-value of about 0.19," he said. "And that is fabulous."
Such superwindows also have soft-coat low-emissivity coatings on all the glass surfaces. "A hard-coat low-e coating is applied as the glass is being made," he said. "A soft-coat low-e coating is applied afterward and is much thicker and much better."
While such windows are more expensive than even the best double-glazed replacement units -- a triple-glazed superwindow will cost between $700 and $900 installed -- they are significantly better at saving energy. In fact, Mr. Damora said, while replacing a residence's single-glazed windows with high-efficiency double-glazed models will result in a savings of between 10 and 15 percent on heating bills, using a triple-glazed super-windows will result in a savings of as much as 47 percent.
"Not everybody can afford these windows," Mr. Damora said. "But think about it. If you put in a new kitchen for $40,000, you're not going to see a return on your investment until you sell your home. When you put in triple-glazed, high-performance windows, you begin saving money the minute the installer walks out the door."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2001

 CORRECTION:
The Your Home column on Jan. 28, about replacing old windows, misstated the range of a measurement used to indicate how much solar heat a pane transmits. The "solar heat gain coefficient" ranges from 0 to 1, not 0.085 to 0.05. The column also misstated the way the coefficient expresses a window's properties. A window with a low coefficient is better at blocking heat than a window with a higher coefficient. A reader's letter questioning the figures was received on Feb. 24.

HEADLINE: Up Against The Drawing Board; 
For Lawmakers, Push May Come to Shove When 6 Congressional Districts Become 5

BYLINE:  By MAURA CASEY 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT, the Land of Steady Habits, may have been a bit too steady in the last 10 years.
 Because recent United States Census figures show that the state grew significantly more slowly than the rest of the country, Connecticut is poised to lose a congressional district for the first time since 1840. The state's delegation in the House of Representatives will go from six to five and the state's electoral votes in presidential elections will be reduced from eight to seven. 
 Since learning the news, state lawmakers have begun the delicate maneuvering that will eventually decide which of the state's six members of Congress will lose his seat and, perhaps, be forced to run against another incumbent. 
This political game of musical chairs will be in the hands of eight members of the General Assembly, four Republicans and four Democrats. The majority and minority leaders of Connecticut's House and Senate each have the power to appoint two members to a Reapportionment Committee; by tradition, they appoint themselves and one other legislator. The committee will then have until Sept. 15 to send a redistricting plan to the legislature for ratification by a two-thirds vote. 
Unlike many other states, where the process is more partisan, Connecticut's Constitution mandates an even-handed process that gives both major parties equal say. 
Still, tension is high. The eight state legislators will not only redraw the lines of congressional districts, but those of the General Assembly's Senate and House districts as well.
"There is no small amount of trepidation depending on where your district is," said Kevin Sullivan, the Democrat who is Senate President Pro Tempore. "There is no part of Connecticut that isn't going to change." (Mr. Sullivan said he expected to appoint himself and Senator Joseph J. Crisco Jr. to the redistricting committee).
Members have not been appointed to the Reapportionment Committee, which will do the bulk of its work after June 1, when the current legislative session ends. Still, activity has begun. Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz reports that her office has received telephone calls from first selectmen concerned about possible changes to legislative district boundaries and how alterations could change towns' representation in the General Assembly. The legislative leadership has begun to hire staff to assist the committee. The work of data collection has already begun, but it won't swing into high gear until the Census Bureau releases detailed, town-by-town population statistics, which are not expected until mid-March at the earliest. 
"This is likely to be a very contentious process," said Ms. Bysiewicz, whose office will produce a map outlining the districts after the Reapportionment Committee does its work. She said the Democrats would like to get rid of Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican who has just begun his first term representing the Second District, while the Republicans would like to get rid of Jim Maloney, who just won re-election to a third term, because his Fifth District is a swing district and several years ago was represented by a Republican.
In the end, it is the Fifth District that is likely to be merged with others, according to many politicians, including several who are likely to be on the redistricting committee. Mr. Maloney's district has the distinction of touching the boundaries of all the other congressional districts in the state; its longest border is shared with the Sixth District, now represented by Representative Nancy Johnson, an 18-year incumbent Republican. 
While some say that makes the Fifth a natural to be at least partially absorbed by the Sixth, Mr. Maloney argued otherwise, saying that his district contains Waterbury, which he says is too large a city to be included in another district. The idea that the Fifth would be merged into the Sixth District is "a Republican fantasy," he said. 
"Not necessarily," said a key Democrat, Senator Sullivan, who described the options as limited. "I don't know much else that we would likely be dealing with," other than the merger of the Fifth and Sixth Districts, he said.
The only other congressman whose district appears vulnerable is Mr. Simmons, the Republican who defeated Sam Gejdenson, a 20-year incumbent Democrat,last November. One option for the redistricting committee is to split the huge, 54-town Second District in half, creating a shoreline district that would stretch from New Haven to the Rhode Island border. This would change the Third District, represented for 10 years by a Democrat, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro. The other half of the Second District would become part of the First District, dominated by Hartford and currently represented by another Democrat, John Larson. 
Mr. Simmons said such a split would be a big mistake. "Those who love Connecticut should think long and hard before screwing up the social, economic and political community that is Eastern Connecticut in the name of giving a hard time to a freshman congressman," he said. 
"If this process is to be fair, I need more Republicans in my district, not less," he said, noting that only 23 percent of the voters in his district are registered Republicans.
Congressman Larson said that the larger issue, beyond the fate of any one district, is one of clout. "Any time you lose a seat, you lose clout, but we are lucky that the delegation has so much experience and seniority," he said. 
State Representative Moira Lyons, who is Speaker of the House, agreed. "True clout is measured in the quality of people you have who represent you, not necessarily the number of people in a delegation," said Representative Lyons, a Democrat from Stamford. "We're fortunate in who we have in Congress. Certain delegations might have 20 people, but even if you have just one or two, if you have enough respect and clout you could bring that state the importance it needs. I don't see the issue in numbers, but in leadership and respect." 
Representative Lyons said she would probably appoint herself to the Reapportionment Committee, although she had not originally planned to do so, saying she had been unaware until recently that it was a common practice for leadership to do so.
With regard to the need to reduce congressional seats, she said: "What will probably happen is that a Republican and a Democrat will end up facing off. If you think of the rationale of one side against another, are the Republicans going to agree that two Republicans will run against one another? I don't think so. Are we Democrats going to make two Democrats run against each other? I don't think so." 
Representative Robert M. Ward, the North Branford Republican who is minority leader of the state House of Representatives, said he expected to appoint himself to the Reapportionment Committee. He said that the five new congressional districts in the state would each have about 100,000 more people than the existing districts and that the Fifth District is "the most likely to get amended" because it touches on all the other districts. 
The Senate Minority Leader, Louis C. DeLuca, agreed, saying it wasn't logical to cut the Second District in half. Senator DeLuca, who said he intended to appoint himself, so far is the only member of the committee who is a veteran of the last Reapportionment Committee in 1990. "We'll try to keep politics out of this as much as possible," he said.
He said that his experience on the 1990 committee doesn't necessarily give him the edge. "Experience doesn't drive this process," he said. "It is the art of compromise. Nobody has the advantage."
Senator DeLuca noted that, in the event the committee can't come to a decision by Sept. 15, the committee would become a Reapportionment Commission and would choose a ninth member. That ninth member would cast the deciding vote on the new districts, and the decision would be legally binding without a ratifying vote of the legislature. In both 1980 and 1990, the committee deadlocked and had to elect a ninth member. 
Unlike many states, Connecticut's redistricting process has virtually no role for the governor; the vote of the legislature is considered a resolution and therefore is not subject to a gubernatorial veto. The only influence that Gov. John G. Rowland could have -- outside of his powers of persuasion -- would occur in the unlikely event that the legislators couldn't decide on new district boundaries by Nov. 30 even with a ninth member. Then it would be turned over to the state Supreme Court, and the governor's judicial appointees would have until Feb. 15 of next year to choose new districts. 
"Letting the courts decide this is the worst-case scenario," Senator DeLuca said. "Not that the courts aren't smart, but they might chop up the state as if they are wielding a cookie-cutter. It's incumbent upon us to work things out."
Because the committee will have to eliminate a congressional district, something the 1990 committee didn't have to contend with, the job "would be a little tougher this time around," Senator DeLuca said. Has he received any anxious telephone calls from Washington?
"Congressmen haven't called me, but let's just say that they've all been a lot more friendly lately," Senator DeLuca said with a laugh.

HEADLINE: For the Director, It's Lights Out 

BYLINE:  By ANNE M. AMATO 

 BODY:
LAST October, Louis Burke, the artistic director for Stratford Festival Theater Inc., predicted that January would be the "do or die" date for securing money needed to complete renovations to the theater that was once home to star-studded Shakespeare productions. If the money didn't come through, he said, it would mean curtains for the project.
 Mr. Burke was right about the date, but not about what the curtains would fall on. 
 On Jan. 9, Mr. Burke himself was fired in what the theater's Board of Directors called "sweeping management changes in order to at long last bring the theater to life again after decades of darkness." Two directors resigned in protest of the board's action.
In another change, the board -- whose number has fluctuated considerably over the years -- added two new members who are Broadway producers, Leonard Soloway and Steven Levy. 
At issue is the future of the 14-acre Elm Street property where the 1,502-seat former American Festival Theater is located. The theater, which opened in 1955, went bankrupt in 1982 and was taken over by the state. Since then the theater has been open for only one season -- 1989.
In 1995 the state chose Mr. Burke's company, Brickhill-Burke Productions Ltd., to redevelop the theater site; that contract has also been terminated by the board. In 1998, the group Stratford Festival Theater Inc. was set up as a nonprofit fundraising organization to work on Mr. Burke's elaborate $180 million plan for the site, which would include two more theaters, hotels, restaurants and shops.
A major reason cited for Mr. Burke's removal was his inability to bring in the funding he had promised so the theater could reopen, according to Bill Martin, spokesman for Stratford Festival Theater.
In fact, Mr. Burke had admitted last October that backers of the project had pulled out because of a clause in the contract that said the property would revert to the state if the theater project failed.
Mr. Martin said "lots of other funding sources" were interested in the project, but they felt that if Mr. Burke "wasn't able to revive the theater after 10 years, then why back him?"
State Senator George Gunther, a Republican of Stratford who is a longtime supporter of Mr. Burke and his project, agreed. "Lots of money people we have met with over the past few months seemed to have a problem with him," said Mr. Gunther, who added, "Louie just made a lot of promises, but never seemed to follow through."
But Mr. Burke said this week that it was the board, and not him, that failed to come up with money, for the project and for productions as well.
"The board had asked me to prepare a summer season and said they would provide funding for it, but they didn't deliver," he said. "Now they are finger-pointing at me."
Mr. Burke also claims he was underpaid for his services. "I was paid $100,000 over the past three years,' he said. "They owe me $1.25 million."
Mr. Burke said he was considering suing the board. 
His attorney, Ira Grudberg, said: "We want to take our time and look at our options. There's no hurry. This isn't a rear-end collision."
Alan Capper, the chairman of the board's public relations committee, said that the board was now "working on specific goals, like getting a fund-raising package together and making an appeal to the state and to foundations and corporations in the immediate area." 
The board, over the past two years, has already obtained a $500,000 grant from the state Department of Economic and Community Development; a $500,000 matching grant from Stratford to complete infrastructure improvements; and a $1.5 million working capital bank loan, guaranteed by the Department of Economic and Cultural Development. 
Also, in July the state conveyed the title to the theater property to Stratford Festival Theater and forgave the purchase price of $1.5 million -- actions for which the board gives credit to Mr. Gunther. 
However, more than $1 million is still needed to complete the theater renovations, Mr. Capper said. 
The board also needs money for operating costs, said Mr. Martin, adding many employees of Stratford Festival Theater, including himself, haven't been paid in months. Otherbills, like those for utilities, are also piling up, he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Burke still lives at a house next to the theater property, which he has been renting. However, locks to the theater and to the administrative building, where Mr. Burke had an office, have been changed.
"It's pretty normal procedure to change the locks immediately after any type of personnel change," said Mr. Martin. "It's more an insurance issue than anything."
The theater has also been boarded up, due to the high cost of heating the building this winter, said Mr. Martin. 
"It's the same thing that used to be done when the theater was used for summer stock," he said. "We drained all the pipes and put anti-freeze in the toilets and it will stay that way until we can pay for the heat, or until the spring."

College Plans to Develop Business Park in Lakewood

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD 

 BODY:
FOR more than 20 years a 240-acre swath of scrub pine along Cedar Bridge Avenue in the northern Ocean County township of Lakewood has sat fallow. Now a development company owned by a Jewish college is pursuing plans to turn the site into a two million square foot business park.
 The $300 million Cedarbridge Corporate Campus at Lakewood will have up to 15 low-rise and midrise buildings with office and research and development space as well as stores and restaurants. Some 120 residences for the elderly are also planned as part of the project. 
 It is to rise over the next 15 years on the site, which is in the southeastern section of the 25-square mile community and has long defied development because such public services as roads, sewers, electricity and telephone have not yet been brought in. The township, which owns most of the 240 acres, declared the site a redevelopment area in 1990. 
For Lakewood the aim of the project is not only to generate tax revenue and jobs, but to shift the township's image from an industrial to a corporate address, said State Senator Robert W. Singer, a Republican from Jackson and a member of the Township Committee, Lakewood's governing body.
"We could have put in another industrial park," he said, referring to three such nearby parks. "But we wanted something that would bring in higher-paying jobs, have a ripple effect and offer residents who work outside the area a reason to stay." 
Lakewood designated the Cedarbridge Development Corporation as developer of the site in June. The company was formed by Beth Medrash Govoha, which has 3,000 students and has been a presence in Lakewood since 1943. The college's main nine-acre campus is between Sixth and Seventh Streets across from Georgian Court College, a Roman Catholic institution.
For Beth Medrash Govoha the project "represents a prudent risk and an opportunity to create a serious long-term endowment for the college, as well as jobs for students and the township," said George Kline, chairman of its committee for development and endowment. And "who knows the neighborhood better than the college?" said Mr. Kline, who is also president of Park Tower Group, a Manhattan-based development company, and who sits on the board of Cedarbridge Development.
Principals of other development companies in New York and New Jersey are also on the board, including Charles Kushner of the Kushner Companies of Florham Park and Samuel Halpern of Atlantic Realty of Woodbridge. 
Cedarbridge has hired Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate service firm, to market the project and the Hillier Group of Princeton to design it. The manager is Picus Associates of Princeton, which works with Princeton University to develop Princeton Forrestal Center, a 2,200-acre office and research park in Plainsboro and East Brunswick, where six million square feet of space has been built out of an eventual nine million feet.
FINANCING for the Lakewood project will come from the school and conventional lending sources, said Philip Ludeke of Picus Associates. So far Cedarbridge has invested $500,000 in developing the site. 
Mr. Ludeke said construction would start once it secures state and local approval, which is expected in 12 months. The site improvement cost is expected to be at least $10 million.
After the improvements are made, the redevelopment agreement calls for the township to release the land, valued at $4 million, in pieces to Cedarbridge. It also calls for Cedarbridge to develop 40 acres in the first seven years and 40 more acres five years later.
Such safeguards will protect the interest of the township, according to Senator Singer and Lakewood's mayor, Marta D. Harrison. If the agreement is not met, the land with improvements reverts to the township, and "we will be no worse off than when we started," Mayor Harrison said.
If the project is fully realized, it will produce 12,000 jobs, according to the developer, and it will generate between $8 million and $10 million in new tax revenue a year, Mayor Harrison said. In addition, she said, the project is not expected to overburden the town's roads, because it will be close to a new interchange planned along the Garden State Parkway, where construction is to get under way this summer. 
With its benefits and safeguards, the project "is a good deal," Mayor Harrison said, noting that Cedarbridge was selected over one other developer, who wanted to develop the site for industrial use. 
Months after Cedarbridge was designated, however, some residents accused the five-member Township Committee of making the deal to gain votes from the town's large Orthodox Jewish population. The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said it made inquiries about the deal but concluded there was no basis for an investigation.
THE township owns almost all of the 240 acres of the proposed office park's site. That property, along with the 1,800 acres of the three existing industrial parks -- which decades earlier had been made up of tiny lots -- was acquired by the township through foreclosure or condemnation from numerous private owners. Senator Singer said the business park was part of efforts begun several years ago to promote Lakewood as a place for corporations. It follows the construction of a $20 million minor league baseball stadium that he said will make Lakewood a destination. The stadium, to open this spring, is on 55 acres adjacent to the planned business park.
For its part, the township has agreed to reduce taxes on the park's site for 35 years, Mr. Ludeke said. He added that each building would rise only after commitments were received for at least half of its space to safeguard the college from undue risk. 
By proceeding with the park, the developer and township are betting New Jersey's office market will continue its southward march to Ocean County in general and Lakewood in particular. They said that though the county is known for its shore areas, the project should draw pharmaceutical, service and technology tenants for several reasons, including location. 
Along with being near the ballpark and the planned Garden State Parkway interchange, the project is in both an urban enterprise zone and a foreign trade zone. Such zones provide tax breaks and other business incentives to companies locating there. 
Another factor is the project's accessibility to a growing labor pool. Through the 1990's Ocean County grew by 64,000 people, to 497,533; and neighboring Monmouth County increased by 58,000 residents, to 611,444. Both were among the five fastest-growing counties in the state and are expected to remain such through this decade, state planners said.
Both are also targets for jobs. About 28,000 jobs were created in the counties from 1995 to 1999, and the total is expected to rise to 50,600 by 2006, according to state estimates. 
For the Lakewood project Mr. Ludeke said that graduates of Beth Medrash Govoha along with other residents "have moved rapidly into high technology fields, helping to create a solid employment base for technology-savvy companies hoping to locate in the region." 
With its labor base, Ocean County will mature, albeit slowly, into an office market said Jonathan Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization/TNC Worldwide, a real estate services firm in Woodbridge. While there is little existing office space to lease in Monmouth County, this could change, he added, if projects planned there, totaling more than one million square feet, move ahead or the economy cools. 
The Lakewood project will be competitive because of its expected price, said Joseph J. Sarno, senior director at Cushman & Wakefield. In addition to the tax and business incentives, rents will be $3 to $5 a square foot lower than the $15 to $20 a square foot rents in Monmouth County, he said, adding that negotiations are under way with a telecommunications company for 100,000 square feet.
The economy, Senator Singer said, "goes in waves, and while things may be slowing, they are not stopping; so with this project Lakewood will be poised and ready."

HEADLINE: Ready for a Black Governor? If Not Now, When? 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

 BODY:
WHEN Secretary of State DeForest B. Soaries Jr. dipped his toe into the murky pool of gubernatorial politics last month -- suggesting that the next governor of the state should be a member of a minority group, or maybe even himself -- he unleashed a riptide.
 Although Mr. Soaries, or Buster, as he is invariably known around the State House, quickly and inexplicably withdrew his name from consideration, the issues he raised remain on the table. 
 In a state as culturally diverse as New Jersey, where 32 percent of the people are members of a minority group; where the number of minority candidates elected to local and county seats increased by three percent in the last year, outpacing national trends; and where voters are becoming increasingly aware of such sensitive issues as racial profiling, the question must be asked: Is New Jersey ready to elect a black governor?
By most measures, entering this year's gubernatorial race now is almost academic. But if Mayor Jim McGreevey of Woodbridge -- who has been campaigning relentlessly for the Democratic nomination for governor since his narrow loss four years ago -- is any example, it is not too late to begin building support for 2005. 
"You almost have to do two times around the track to get known here," said Tom Giblin, the state Democratic chairman. "If you have serious plans to run for governor in 2005, right now is not a minute too early to begin."
Although blacks represent just 13.6 percent of the state's voting age population, they have played an enormous role in shaping the outcomes of the last several statewide races, from Al Gore's trouncing of George Bush last fall to Mr. McGreevey's near victory four years ago to Jon S. Corzine's narrower-than-expected victory over Representative Bob Franks.
And with Governor Whitman having broken the glass ceiling as the first woman to be elected governor in the state, there is growing sentiment among many blacks that it is time for one of their own to step up to the plate. So far, none have come forward, though some are testing the water. 
"I would be disappointed if in four years time there is not someone in the African-American community who is considered not just by the African-American community but by the state at large to be a viable candidate for governor or U.S. senator," said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey. But being a viable candidate and taking the plunge are two very different things.
While blacks hold 15 seats in the State Legislature and are mayors of some New Jersey's largest cities, they have not managed to leverage that strength and catapult a candidate into statewide office, said Walter Fields, a former political director of the New Jersey chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
"Black elected officials have grown comfortable with their fiefdoms, and they are not willing to grow further or work collectively toward that goal. Historically, we've not aspired to greater heights, we've lowered the bar, accepting the floor when we should be going for the ceiling," said Mr. Fields, noting that in an area like Essex County, where there are four black mayors, a collective front could "wield a tremendous influence on the rest of the state."
Beyond the complacency described by Mr. Fields, several other obstacles stand in the way of a run for governor -- from exposure to substantial financing to an ingrained system of bossism to a suburban bias that runs throughout much of the state. The barriers have apparently been large enough that only one black has run for statewide office, former Mayor Ken Gibson of Newark, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1981 and 1985.
One of the biggest obstacles is simply gaining access to the voters, since New Jersey's political structure offers few opportunities for statewide exposure. While most states have several elective state offices, New Jersey is one of four states where the governor is the only elected state official. Elsewhere, positions like lieutenant governor, attorney general and state comptroller are usually seen as good places for minority candidates to showcase their abilities and build voter confidence on the state level.
"Having a minority as a lieutenant governor gives the ticket a balance and people become used to you," said State Senator Shirley Turner, a Democrat from Mercer County. "So when the governor leaves office, they're comfortable voting for you and don't feel they're taking as much of a risk as with an unknown."
But New Jersey has no lieutenant governor. Moreover, all of the cabinet posts, board commissions and judgeships are appointed by the governor. So while Governor Whitman, for instance, may get points for naming the first black Supreme Court justice and the first black secretary of state, the appointees often find themselves in the politically awkward position of being beholden to the governor.
Most political observers agree that this contributed to Mr. Soaries' quick decision not to enter this year's race, and it was what kept Len Coleman, state commissioner of consumer affairs at the time and more recently commissioner of baseball's National League, from running for United States Senate in 1985 after being discouraged by Governor Tom Kean.
Richard W. Roper, a public policy consultant, suggested that the only real way to get statewide visibility is through an issue, like Mr. Jackson has done with racial profiling.
"If you are able to speak to an issue, and that issue demands coverage, then you're going to be the person attached to that issue and you're going to get the exposure," said Mr. Roper, who, like many others, noted that buying advertising in the two major television markets that serve New Jersey is prohibitively expensive.
Running a statewide campaign can easily cost $5 million; Mr. Corzine just spent $62 million of his own money to become a household name and get elected to the United States Senate. That kind of money is not readily available to most candidates, let alone minority candidates who have historically had far weaker ties to corporate Amnerica.
"For emerging minority candidates, 9 out of 10 will pick up their wealth from outside of the state, drawing money from all over the country," said State Senator Wayne Bryant, a Democrat from Camden County, citing former Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia. "They have to go to a bigger drawing room."
Then, of course, there is the boss system, which is well entrenched in New Jersey. To be a viable candidate, having party backing is essential, and that means receiving the nod from the state's 42 county party chairmen. In the Democratic Party, there is just one black county chairman, John Currie of Passaic County. Among the Republicans, there are two female county chairwoman, but no black men or women.
And while Mr. Currie has been working hard to get more blacks and Hispanics to run for county and local seats, pushing for diversity at the state level is a bit more difficult.
"If a person has worked hard and paid their dues, they shouldn't be kept back because of the color of their skin or ethnicity," said Mr. Currie. "We have a number of qualified African-Americans who could run for governor, but we have a way to go to get to that point."
The state's strongest black leaders come from urban areas, like Mayors Sharpe James of Newark or Douglas Palmer of Trenton, a factor that can actually hurt them in a statewide race, said Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal research organization in Trenton, who believes "New Jersey is not just a suburban state, it's an anti-urban state."
Councilman Cory Booker of Newark, whose name comes up on several lists of black politicians with potential statewide appeal, says he believes that the future of the state is in its urban regions and that the candidate who embraces a more regional attitude will go far.
"We need to stop the tyranny of the 'or' and start the vision of the 'and' to look at how we can have both cities and suburbs and build on that regionalism," said Mr. Booker.
While he says he has no political aspirations beyond Newark at this time, Mr. Booker is quick to add, 'It would be great to see a governor come from Newark."
Despite the challenges of party bosses, New Jersey's voters have proven to be moderate and open-minded, willing to back newcomers whose positions reflect their own concerns. The right candidate with the right message could win public support, forcing party bosses and financial power brokers to line up behind that person.
If the state is not ready for a black governor -- or a black is not ready to run -- there is one minority candidate who many political observers say is well-positioned to make history: Robert Menendez, the Hispanic congressman from Hudson County. But as the fourth-ranking congressional Democrat, Mr. Menendez might well have his sights set elsewhere.
"Generally speaking, being governor of the state would be more desirable than being one of 435 voices in Congress," said Mr. Shure. "But as someone who is moving high up in the ranks, the success of Menendez's career in Congress might make him see things differently.'
One thing New Jersey politics has proven to be is unpredictable.
"Things can happen overnight," said Assemblyman Joseph Charles Jr., a Democrat from Hudson County who is chairman of the New Jersey Legislative Black and Latino Caucus. "Four, almost five years is a long time for something to happen that makes someone irresistible and compelling."
When asked who that compelling or irresistible force might be, the same names kept coming up.

Douglas Palmer
As head of the state's capital city for the last 10 years, Mayor Palmer knows not only the ins and outs of running an executive office but also how state government works. In addition, he gets high marks for helping improve the city's economic base.
Despite the tough decisions he has had to make about raising taxes, he has managed to recast his urban message to a more tempered, regional vision. At 49, the Democratic mayor still has time to widen his base, which he has begun to through a leadership role in the United States Conference of Mayors.
The only thing stopping Mayor Palmer from being a leading contender for governor is what he acknowledges as a "warm but not burning desire in my belly to do it yet."
Still, he says he has been talking about his future with close friends and advisers and asking himself, "Am I going to be mayor my whole life?"
"I look at the candidates who are running for higher office and think, "They don't have anything more on the ball than I do,' " he said.

DeForest Soaries Jr.
Although Mr. Soaries now insists his bid for governor had more to do with delivering a can-do message to a gathering of 600 young black men, the one thing his brief foray into gubernatorial politics did do for Mr. Soaries was convince him of his potential.
"It left me thinking I could put together enough money and support in three years to do it," he said.
As the top-ranking black in the current administration, Mr. Soaries has had the opportunity to gain statewide exposure, but frequently -- like during last year's Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration and the announcement of an initiative for curbing violence in schools -- he has had to step aside to let the governor bask in the limelight.
Although the 49-year-old Mr. Soaries is a Republican and has not enjoyed the natural base of support a Democrat would, he says confidently that for now he is keeping an eye on two other nationally prominent black Republicans, Colin Powell, the new secretary of state, and Condoleeza Rice, named by President Bush to be his national security adviser.
Mr. Soaries said he planned to spend the coming weeks putting together a proposal that would set up an organization to help guide members of minority groups who hoped to seek elective office. And he said he would "watch the political climate this year, see what happens, and see if I have any appetite for 2005."

Reginald T. Jackson
By virtue of his outspoken stand against the practice of racial profiling by the state police, Mr. Jackson has probably had more exposure on television in the past year than any other black leader. While he balked at the notion of seeking office -- "I'm more effective with the role I play now than if I were an elected official" -- Mr. Jackson dismissed those who said he would have to expand his one-issue platform to be considered a serious contender.
"If they're saying that, then they haven't been listening to me," he said. "I've spoken out on school funding, on health care, and education. There's no other organization in the state that has been a more important spokesperson group than the Black Ministers Council."

Wayne Bryant
One of the more powerful black legislators, Senator Bryant has both the advantage and disadvantage of coming out of Camden County. He has solid financial support from corporations and groups based in South Jersey, but being from the politically weaker end of the state, and from the state's poorest city, erodes his base of support. In addition, his strong ties to former Gov. Jim Florio -- who fared poorly in his primary bid against Mr. Corzine -- does not work in his favor.
Nevertheless, by sitting on key committees in his six years in the State Senate and 13 years in the Assembly, Mr. Bryant, 53, has established a good record as a lawmaker and a defender of civil rights.

Sharpe James
By most accounts, Mayor James is the most powerful black politician in the state. It was his endorsement of Mr. McGreevey that helped trigger Senator Robert Torricelli's withdrawal from this year's race for governor. That does not mean everyone likes him, particularly those who have run against him over the last 30 years in the rough-and-tumble environment of Newark politics.
While Newark provides the 64-year-old mayor with vast corporate contacts and fund-raising resources, Mr. James could run squarely into the bias of the suburban voter. 
In addition, high-ranking members of his administration have been investigated by the federal government, including his former chief of staff, Jackie Mattison, who was convicted in 1997 of bribing an insurance broker in exchange for city contracts, and the former police director, William Celester, who in 1996 was convicted of using $30,000 in police funds for vacations and personal gifts. While Mayor James was never charged, the baggage from these scandals may well be too heavy to carry into a statewide race.

Cory Booker
Nipping at Mayor James's heels is the 31-year-old Central Ward councilman who has everyone guessing what his next move might be. For his part, Mr. Booker says his primary interest is in Newark at this time.
"It's time for a change in the top position," he said, addingthat if he could play a role in bringing the city back, "that would be a career. I could walk away from politics after that."
As a Rhodes scholar who grew up in Bergen County's affluent Harrington Park and graduated from Stanford and Yale universities, political observers say Mr. Booker has great cross-over potential -- so much so that the first-term councilman says he has been approached by Republican leaders asking him to consider switching parties.
His own party named him one of the country's "100 Young Democrats" to watch during last summer's Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Yet others are suspicious of what they call his "Mr. Clean" image.
"I've never felt such a sense of efficacy in my life," Mr. Booker said in response to his detractors. "If I continue to feel that sense, I'm going to stay in it."

Donald Payne
The 66-year-old senior black statesman, Donald Payne, may be too old to consider a run for governor in 2005 or 2009, although he says he is in excellent health and has a lot of energy. For now, he is content to play a watchdog role in Congress, which he has been doing since he served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1994 and fought conservative initiatives to reduce social service programs.
"With the new wave in Washington, there's going to be a lot of rolling up of the sleeves to prevent roll backs of the gains we've made," said Mr. Payne, whose brother and nephew both serve in the State Assembly.
As for the governorship, he says: "It's like a continuum. If you're engaged and involved and still committed to public service, you should not rule out any possibility of seeking higher office."

Shirley Turner
The one woman whose name came up on several lists, Senator Turner, has also demonstrated her cross-over appeal, having been elected in a district that includes both urban Trenton and wealthy Princeton and West Windsor. In addition to her four years in the Senate, she has served two terms in the Assembly and as a Mercer County freeholder.
Flattered by the suggestion of seeking the governorship, Senator Turner said she had not really given any thought to running for higher office. But she added: "When I was a freeholder, I never thought about running for Assembly, in the Assembly, I never thought about running for Senate. So based upon my track record, I couldn't rule anything out."

Joseph Charles
As head of the Legislative Black and Latino Caucus, State Assemblyman Joe Charles, 57, is well regarded by his colleagues and minority leaders throughout the state.
Mr. Charles, who is also a lawyer, predicted conservatively that it would take two more cycles before a black could be a viable candidate for governor -- one term for the Democrats to regain control, and another to build a base of support.
By that point, the Essex County assemblyman said he thought "it will be time for me to move over for someone else."

HEADLINE: Houses Are to Replace A Pittsburgh Slag Heap 

BYLINE:  By CHRISS SWANEY 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
A ONETIME riverside slag dump where refuse from Pittsburgh's blast furnaces formed towers as high as 20-story buildings is being turned into the city's largest residential development since World War II. 
 Site clearance is under way for Summerset, a residential community intended to rejuvenate a former industrial dump along the Monongahela River into a community designed according to the tenets of the New Urbanism movement, with front porches, patches of green lawn and other touches of an old-fashioned neighborhood shared by people of many economic levels. 
 The $243 million project is to produce 713 homes and apartments on 240 acres in a section of the city's affluent East End and the infrastructure to support them. 
As in most Rust Belt cities, Pittsburgh's riverfront was once home to mills and warehouses. Now, more than $300 million in public and private money has been pumped into a half dozen projects to restore the old industrial riverfront. 
Stadiums for baseball and football are under construction near the city's downtown waterfront. They join other river-based entertainment venues including Sandcastle, a water-based amusement park that opened in 1989, and several new boat clubs featuring river sailing.
Summerset is one of the city's first major residential waterfront developments, and its backers say it has attracted extensive interest. Sally A. Pfaff, Summerset's project manager, said the developers plan to conduct a lottery to pick bidders for the lots.
"People are fascinated by the New Urbanism," Ms. Pfaff said. "The chance to have porches, garages off an alley and a real pedestrian community has given us a waiting list of 500." 
THE development, which is near Beechwood Boulevard, a major street, and which provides direct access to Frick Park, one of the city's oldest attractions, is designed to have the look and feel of an old-fashioned city neighborhood.
Vince Sacca, a metals broker who is on the waiting list for a house in the project, said that for him Summerset's attractions include the project's design and the views of the water and the adjacent park, as well as its proximity to upscale restaurants and recreation.
"I want to live in a home that has all the modern amenities but has a traditional feel to it," he said.
Mark Jones, the architect in charge of the Summerset project for the Memphis firm of Looney Ricks Kiss, said the ideas summed up in the phrase New Urbanism were "spreading like wildfire." Mr. Jones said that homebuyers are looking for communities where they can walk to the grocery store or the neighborhood playground. "We have purposely put the garage behind the homes and created the old neighborhood alley, so people have room to interact from their porches and front yards," he said.
The riverfront site has played several roles. At the turn of the century, the property was used as a golf course. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., whose father helped plan Central Park in New York City as well as Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, wanted the site to be set aside as a park. But the golf course was eventually razed. 
Between 1922 and 1972, more than 20 million tons of slag were dumped at the site by local steel producers. Looking like a desolate moonscape, the old industrial slag heap had been home to a flock of migratory birds and a few stray dogs until the city's Urban Redevelopment Authority purchased the 243 acres in December 1995 from the Duquesne Slag Company, which had used it to dispose of the residue of steel manufacturing, for $3.8 million in the hope of developing the property. 
A combination of public and private financing is helping to clean up a polluted stream running through the development. The watershed cleanup will also add 130 acres to the 455-acre Frick Park, named for Henry Clay Frick, whose stockpiles of coke helped the industrialist Andrew Carnegie turn Pittsburgh into a major steel producer.
The new community will include single-family homes, attached town houses and apartments, with prices ranging from $180,000 for two and a half story cottage-style homes with two or three bedrooms to $375,000 and up for 4,500-square-foot houses with four or five bedrooms, according to Mark Schneider, president of the Rubinoff Company, the lead developer. 
More than 122,000 tons of soil have been dumped on the site so far as part of the process of making it suitable for housing, and by the end of the decade a total of 203,000 tons of topsoil will be needed to cover all the slag. 
Several community groups had voiced concern about the amount of dust created from grading the old slag site, so air-monitoring equipment was mounted on a hill overlooking the project. 
Summerset is less than 15 minutes from the medical complexes and cultural district in the city's Oakland section, 10 minutes from the upscale Squirrel Hill shopping district and a 15-minute drive by expressway to downtown.
IT is expected to add $3.4 million annually in property and wage taxes to the city. The National City Bank of Pennsylvania will provide the construction loans.
This is the second major riverfront property developed by Rubinoff, which is based in Pittsburgh. In 1987, the company started construction on the long-neglected, 42-acre Herr's Island, which had been the site of slaughterhouses, a scrap yard and a company that refurbished old railroad cars. The island is now home to several commercial buildings, residential housing and a handful of technology incubator firms.
Construction at Summerset is scheduled to begin in February with the building of six model homes. It is to be completed in three phases over the next 10 years. The first segment, estimated to cost $42 million, includes construction of 72 single-family homes; 41 town houses; a two-story 48-apartment rental building; and 40 two-story rental town houses.
The second phase, estimated to cost about $73 million, is to include 139 single-family homes, 49 town houses and a two-story, 104-apartment rental building, while the final phase, at a cost of $63 million, includes 125 single-family homes, 28 town houses and 64 apartment units in a two-story building. 
Each of the homes will have a two-car garage, fireplace, landscaped yard and wiring for Internet connections. 
The city's Urban Redevelopment Authority received $7.5 million from the state, $7.1 million from the city and $360,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency for sewer and road work and the planting of grass. The restoration of the polluted stream running through the project is being supported by $5 million from the Army Corps of Engineers and $2.7 million from the city.
Summerset's development partners include Rubinoff, Montgomery Rust of Pittsburgh and JR Glunt of Pittsburgh, which are building the village homes, town houses and estate houses; Pennrose Properties of Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh-based Ralph Falbo, producing the multifamily units; and EQA Landmark Communities and Kacin Builders, constructing the cottage houses. 
The city still owns the land and will receive a portion of the sales price when each home is sold. For the first phase the city expects to receive $1.6 million, and for the whole development it expects to receive more than $21 million in the next 10 years or so.

Seeking a Common Rule Book for International Mergers

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
IMAGINE two giant corporations merging their businesses, from corporate headquarters in New York and London to far-flung divisions across the globe. The deal is done. The headlines sound their clarions. The chief executives announce the winner's prize (the executive suite) for one and the loser's (stock options) for the other.
 What comes next is the part most dreaded by the partners in some megamergers: scrutiny by antitrust regulators, supposedly to guarantee that newly created behemoths -- like AOL Time Warner, which faced regulatory objections in Europe and the United States -- do not threaten consumers by dominating markets. 
 That scrutiny, according to an increasing number of corporate officials, lawyers and regulators, means growing thickets of obstacles to the current surge of mergers and acquisitions.
In the decade since capitalism's triumph over the Soviet empire, the corporate rush to ever greater economies of scale has been accompanied -- though with much less fanfare -- by a proliferation in the number of jurisdictions with competition laws, supposedly to ensure that mergers do not create corporate monsters accountable to no one. So corporate lawyers now confront a litany of regulatory requirements.
J. William Rowley, chairman of the International Bar Association's Global Forum for Competition Policy, says the number of regulatory agencies worldwide that must sanctify mergers has mushroomed. "This is the antitrust explosion," he said. "We have probably got over 80 antitrust regimes in the world and another two dozen in the making. Ten years ago, we would have had six or seven."
In one deal alone in 1999, Mr. Rowley said, lawyers from the Coca-Cola Company and Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. sought antitrust approval in more than 40 jurisdictions around the world. In another -- the ultimately failed effort to merge Alcan Aluminum of Canada, Pechiney of France and Algroup of Switzerland into an aluminum giant -- lawyers from 35 firms filed for regulatory approval in 16 jurisdictions and 8 languages, he said. And in each jurisdiction, corporations faced costs that included wildly varying filing fees paid to regulators and lawyers.
In Austria, the filing fee for regulatory approval of a merger can be as little as $77. In the United States it is $45,000. In Croatia, it is $140,000.
Next weekend, though, regulators, legal experts, business representatives and government officials will try to take a first step in what is expected to be a difficult route toward a standardized global antitrust review process.
Meeting under the auspices of the International Bar Association, based in London, the participants will include important officials like Mario Monti, the European Commission's competition commissioner. The conference will be held in an 18th-century manor house with 42 bedrooms at Ditchley Park, near Oxford.
It is unclear who will represent the United States, where the new Bush administration has yet to clarify its antitrust policy or indicate how it might differ from that of the Clinton administration. For that reason, the timing of the conference has already provoked something of a trans-Atlantic spat.
But Mr. Rowley said, "the reason you ought not to wait is that this is an initiative that has been a long time coming." The organizers, he added, thought that any delay would have been a setback to a process that had been gathering steam since last September, when Joel I. Klein, the former United States Justice Department official in charge of antitrust enforcement, announced a shift in American policy.
Previously, the United States had rejected the idea of trying to reach an international consensus on competition law. But Mr. Klein promised broad backing for an approach to draft international standards. That shift surprised and encouraged European regulators, who had been pressing for a similar approach for years. How the Bush administration views the issue remains to be seen.
"There have been a lot of people asking questions about the direction of antitrust under the new administration," said Eric London, a spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission in Washington. But until the decision-making officials are appointed in the Justice Department and the commission itself, he said, "there's not a lot to go on."
For Europe, of course, a common competition law is a necessity, in part because the 15-nation European Union plans to expand to as many as 25 nations, creating a huge market that is supposed to encourage competition. Mr. Monti, who has a reputation as a tough enforcer of antitrust regulations, has made clear that he will not allow big companies to hamper new competitors as the European Union expands.
In the United States too, corporations and regulators have been pushing for some standardization of the confusing patchwork of merger regulations across the globe. In several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Turkey and Russia, the notification rules are based on the global revenue of the companies in the merger. The thresholds can vary from a paltry $300,000 in Russia to $2.5 billion in Argentina, according to the International Bar Association.
The Ditchley Park conference has set only modest aims. No one on either side of the Atlantic is talking about a new international bureaucracy to oversee mergers -- an idea that the United States has rejected. In the past, the United States has also opposed a European proposal to give the World Trade Organization a central role in policing mergers.
Rather, according to Clinton administration thinking, the idea is to simplify competition laws and, in the words of one official last year, create a consensus among regulators to make "antitrust enforcement coherent and predictable."
Mr. Rowley said that at the conference next week, "we should make progress in defining objectives."

Slowing Business Travel Means Savings for Tourists

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
JANE ISTVAN will soon make her annual winter journey to Miami Beach to visit her grandmother. But this year's trip will come with a bonus: significant savings on hotel expenses. 
 Ms. Istvan, 34, a lawyer from Philadelphia, along with her husband, Jeffrey, 33, also a lawyer, and their 2-year-old son, Sam, will spend six nights in March in a two-room suite at a Hilton Grand Vacations beachfront resort in South Beach. Their room rate is $150 a night, a bargain for Florida's peak travel season. Last year, she and her family paid $20 less a night, but for a much smaller room at a hotel with fewer amenities and blocks away from the beach. 
 To get the suite, Ms. Istvan turned to Quikbook.com, a hotel consolidator. Consolidators obtain blocks of rooms that hotels are unable to fill and sell them at discounts, usually 25 to 60 percent off published room rates, to individuals or travel agents. 
Had she booked directly with the Hilton resort, she would have paid $350 a night.
Other leisure travelers may find similar bargains this winter and spring as a softening in business travel adds to the inventory of vacant hotel rooms for consolidators and discount travel companies to sell. A slowing economy and continued increases in business air fares are causing many large companies to curtail travel plans this year. 
Sean Hennessey, director of the hospitality and leisure practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, predicted that 4.3 million rooms that hotels previously would have reserved this year for business travelers would go instead to convention visitors or leisure travelers; that figure represents 3 percent of total hotel room inventory in the United States. Among the cities where he expects to find weakness are New Orleans, Dallas, Denver, St. Louis, Phoenix, Atlanta, Seattle, Philadelphia and Orlando, Fla.
Survey results released last week by the National Business Travel Association appear to bear out some of Mr. Hennessey's forecasts. It found that 61 percent of Fortune 1000 companies planned to eliminate all but the most essential travel, while 57 percent said they would reduce the number of employees per trip, and 46 percent reported cutting back on business meetings that required travel.
"There's no question companies are asking people to think twice before they take trips," said Henry Harteveldt, who oversees the travel practice of Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm.
Although Mr. Harteveldt said he thought the trade group's survey painted an overly bleak picture, he predicted that business travel could fall significantly if the economy continued to weaken. If economic growth slowed to a rate of 2 to 3 percent, down from about 4.5 percent last year, he said, business travel would decline 5 to 10 percent. But in the event of a recession -- a decline in the economy for two consecutive quarters -- the falloff in business travel would be 10 percent to 20 percent, he added.
There are already signs of softening -- as Ms. Istvan has discovered. Several hotel consolidators, like Quikbook of New York, and Hotel Reservations Network of Dallas, and travel discounters like Priceline.com, say they are receiving a higher-than-usual number of rooms in major cities, which could mean more bargains for vacationers. "Corporate travelers have a short booking horizon, so any rooms they cancel must go to channels of distribution that are fast," Mr. Hennessey explained.
Bob Diener, the president of Hotel Reservations Network, said he had seen "a huge number of hotels lower rates and increase blocks of rooms in the last four weeks." At his network, which offers rooms at 2,500 hotels in 105 cities, the deals are showing up most often in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Orlando, New Orleans and Washington, with rates dropping $5 to $40 a night, he said.
Quikbook, which represents about 400 hotels in over 30 cities, has seen an increase in available rooms in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Miami and Seattle, according to Raymond Vastola, the company's president. At the hotels' request, he said, the rooms are being offered at rates $10 to $35 less than usual for this time of year. And the discounts are for longer periods -- 60 to 90 days in the future, rather than the usual 30- to 60-day advance booking period, he added.
FOR Priceline.com customers, who list the price they will pay for rooms, then learn if their bids are accepted, the bidding success rate for rooms in New York "is double what it was a couple of months ago," said Christopher Soder, Priceline's president for hotels. Customers bidding for rooms in Orlando, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Atlanta are also finding "a very high success rate," he added. Priceline offers rooms at more than 6,000 hotels in 1,300 cities in North America.
Mr. Diener of Hotel Reservations Network said he thought 2001 would be "a soft year for hotels -- not terrible but not as good as it's been the last couple of years."
"This will translate into great bargains for consumers," he added. "If you're flexible, you'll probably find a bigger selection of deals this year than last."
Most online hotel consolidator and discount travel sites require customers to list their destination cities, travel dates and the range of rates they are willing to pay. The Web sites then search for lists of appropriate hotels. But some sites, like Priceline.com and Hotwire.com, do not reveal the names of hotels before they are booked. Priceline also requires travelers to pay whatever rate they propose, though Hotwire lets customers reject rates they consider undesirable.
Other rules may apply. Hotel Reservations Network requires full payment in advance for its rooms and charges a $50 fee to change or cancel a reservation; similar fees for changes or cancellations are sometimes imposed by other consolidators or by the hotels they represent. 
And, sometimes, the best rates are still available directly from a hotel, not from a discounter site. The lesson, of course, is to shop around.
David Goldstone, 32, a business executive from Orlando, did some shopping before settling on Travelocity, an online travel agent that obtains its discounted hotel rooms from Hotel Reservations Network. Over the last three years, he has booked 50 business and pleasure trips through Travelocity, including several vacations with his wife, Juli, 37, and 2-year-old son, Max. 
His next trip will be a three-night visit to Las Vegas in mid-March to attend a convention and to visit with several college friends. He found a $100-a-night rate at the Las Vegas Hilton through Travelocity. If he had made reservations directly through the hotel, the total rate would have been $477 for the three nights.
Jaci Maher, 37, who owns a print shop in Pittsburgh, recently used Quikbook to reserve a six-night stay early next month at the Doubletree Guest Suites at Walt Disney World. She and her husband, Larry, 36, an engineer, and their three young children will stay in a one-bedroom suite at $135 a night for the first three nights and $165 for the last three. The room normally goes for $179 a night. "I'm probably staying at a nicer hotel than I would have -- right in Disney World," Mrs. Maher said.
How long such deals will last will depend primarily on the health of the overall economy, industry experts say. Mr. Hennessey, for one, expects that hotel bargains will be offered online at least "through the start of the summer." 
"What happens in the first quarter of the year will establish whether these favorable opportunities continue," he said.
That is good news for Ms. Istvan, who is also thinking about an overnight excursion to New York. As for the Miami Beach trip, she said, the savings on accommodations will let the family splurge on other things, like an extra stone-crab dinner. And the larger room will provide more privacy.
"My husband and I will be happy not to have to whisper to each other for two hours when we put the baby to sleep at night."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Eroding Paper Gains May Undo a Remarkable Resiliency

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
STOCK market investors endured considerable pain last year, and for the most part, they took it with aplomb. As stock prices sank, nobody seemed to panic -- or to riot in the streets. Even when they saw their losses in black and white in year-end statements from brokerage firms and mutual funds, investors kept their cool.
 An impressive performance, given that from the stock market's peak last March to its trough in December, an estimated $3 trillion in market value vanished from sight. 
 Had investors panicked in the face of such losses, the broad market indexes would be in far worse shape in 2001 than they are. At the close of last week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq composite had a gain of 12.6 percent. Only the Dow Jones industrials showed a loss, of 1.2 percent. 
Fathoming how investors will react to falling share prices has become an important study among economists and strategists. After all, the rising stock market and the wealth it brought to consumers did a lot to fuel the economy in recent years. Flush with their stock gains, at least on paper, Americans bought second homes and luxury cars and vacationed with a vengeance. If those gains disappear, some economists fear that sobered consumers will push an already slowing economy into recession. 
So it was a great relief to many people that the market stabilized in January. One of the biggest reasons it did, of course, was Alan Greenspan's surprise move to cut interest rates by one-half of a percentage point on Jan. 3. And most economists believe that rates will be slashed again when the Federal Reserve Board meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Barrington, Ill., contends that the early-January decision was made in part to forestall an investor panic in the stock market, especially in Nasdaq stocks. But Mr. Bianco, in a report written for the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, argues that investors are not likely to abandon the stock market en masse until most of their unrealized profits disappear. Only then will they jump ship, causing the reverse wealth effect to harm the economy.
To try to measure where individual investors stand with their portfolios, Mr. Bianco has compiled an index of the stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000, all weighted equally. This combination, which he has tracked since 1990, best reflects the holdings in equity mutual funds, he said. Then he estimates the average cost of investors' domestic mutual fund purchases by analyzing equity fund inflows.
"Since 1990, the public has put about $1.4 trillion into the stock market, and they have about $1.88 trillion of market value," Mr. Bianco said. The difference between those numbers -- approximately $470 billion as of the end of November -- is their unrealized gain.
Investors view their unrealized profits as gamblers do their casino winnings: it is the house's money at stake.
"You don't treat it with the care and love that you do with your hard-earned paycheck," Mr. Bianco said. 
But the minute that those winnings disappear, all bets are off.
Mr. Bianco saw such a shift in investor psychology some years ago, in bond funds. Investors in those funds reached the break-even point in April 1994 and they promptly began exiting the arena. For the next year, bond funds saw nothing but outflows, on a monthly basis.
Although investors' unrealized profits have fallen by $285 billion, or 38 percent, since they peaked in December 1999 -- Mr. Bianco said that because investors still had $470 billion in house money to play with, they would remain bullish on stocks. 
"My argument is the reverse wealth effect will hit with a vengeance when we get to the break-even point in stock market gains," he said. "Only then will people become disillusioned with the stock market and not jump back in."

A Tale Of2 Totals In the Jobs Report

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
IT is the case of the missing four million jobs.
 When the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report on Friday, it will show that private employers in the United States have added about 21 million jobs to their payrolls over the last decade. The same report will also show that the employers have added fewer than 17 million jobs to their payrolls over the last decade. 
 Confused? You should be.
The Labor Department's jobs report, which can move markets and dominate business news once every month, is in fact two reports. One comes from a survey of 350,000 businesses that provides data on hours worked and employment by sector. The other comes from a survey of 50,000 households that produces the unemployment rate. Each survey gives the government an estimate of the total number of jobs in the American economy. 
All of this would seem like technical detail best left for doctoral students in economics -- if it were not for the discomforting fact that the two surveys have been telling quite different stories for the last decade. The business survey has offered a far more optimistic picture, suggesting that the private work force has grown by an impressive 22.8 percent. The household survey says employers have increased their payrolls 18.5 percent -- the worst such gain since the 1950's. The difference is those four million jobs that exist only in the business survey.
To be fair, there has always been some gap between the studies. People who work two jobs, for example, show up twice in the business survey and only once in the household survey. But the current difference between the studies is unprecedented.
Until the early 1990's, the gap remained between one million and four million. Add that to the mysterious growth of the gap in the 1990's, and the total difference today rises to just a hair under eight million. This growth, Chinhui Juhn and Simon Potter wrote in a report published in late 1999 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, "has puzzled many analysts."
It might never have been as troublesome, however, as it is now. From Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to individual home buyers and investors, Americans are closely watching the economy these days to see whether a recession, or simply a slowdown, is arriving. Yet one of the most-watched reports issued by the government has a basic flaw. 
The deeper one digs, the more inconsistencies arise. The business survey says contingent work, like temporary staffing, has taken off in recent years. The household survey says it has barely budged.
Which survey is more credible? 
Labor Department officials tried to answer the question by looking at the most likely suspects for the gap's cause. The officials studied whether more people held two jobs today than in the past or whether more teenagers under 16, who are not counted in the household survey, now work. They asked whether the surveyed households were concentrated in slow-growing regions.
"There was no smoking gun," said Thomas L. Nardone, who oversees the household survey.
The most popular theory, offered in the paper written by Ms. Juhn and Mr. Potter, is that the Census Bureau's estimate of the nation's population is too low. That would mean that even if the household survey accurately estimated the portion of Americans who were working, the Labor Department was not multiplying that percentage by a large-enough number. When the government finishes work on the 2000 Census, the answer should be clearer.
Of course, this theory supports the business survey and its more optimistic view. Because the business poll covers so many more jobs -- tens of millions versus 100,000 -- most analysts consider it more reliable, Mr. Nardone said, even if they cannot explain the gap.
But the matter should not be dismissed simply by throwing out the household survey. (And if it could be, people should reject the unemployment rate as inaccurate, too.) The business survey has its weaknesses. 
To account for start-ups, the Labor Department now adds 165,000 jobs each month that do not actually turn up in its survey. Based on historical data, researchers figure that this is the number of jobs they are missing. But the economy has been slowing sharply, and the number -- twice what it was in 1993 -- could now be exaggerated.
Executives are also more likely than household heads to err by counting some workers twice. That happened once in the early 1990's, forcing the government to make an embarrassing revision.
It is enough to make most people throw up their hands. The better solution is to look at both reports with a skeptical eye -- until somebody can solve the mystery.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
California Still Stands, Despite One More Punch

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
BASED on all the hoo-ha, one may think that the shocks from California's power crisis will soon loose the state from the North American land mass. The stock market is telling a different story.
 Since Dec. 21, when it hit a six-month low, the Bloomberg California Index, comprising 594 companies based in the Golden State, is up nearly 14 percent. 
 Power failures are clearly annoying. But the state, which is the world's sixth-largest economy, has faced much bigger challenges. It is not nice to have the lights go out in the office, but most public California companies are not parochial operations. 
Conrad Herrmann, manager of the $2.8 billion Franklin Templeton California Growth fund, took time last week to talk about the power crisis and California stocks. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Lots of people are wringing their hands over the California power situation. How serious is it?

A. There is reason to be concerned, and there have been disruptions. But most of the disruptive effects will be felt by smaller companies, and we are not invested in those.
The power crisis is the latest punch the state has had to take. Last year, we had to deal with the dot-com implosion. 
By comparison, when we launched the fund in 1991, California was suffering its worst recession in years: the defense sector was downsizing; the savings-and-loan crisis was at its peak. California had lost its luster. But the state continually reinvents itself.

Q. As a portfolio manager, isn't one of your goals to find companies that are not heavily dependent on continued good times in the local economy?

A. We try to avoid companies that are vulnerable to a downturn in the California economy.
There are 850,000 incorporated businesses in California, of which about 1,400 are publicly traded. But we winnow that down to some 800-odd names. 
Right now, we have about 150 companies in the portfolio. Of that, only about six or seven are located outside the borders of California.
Some of the companies we invest in, like Intel, Cisco and Flextronics International, are very globally oriented. Others are big domestic players, like Safeway or Tenet Healthcare. 
And we make investments in companies that might benefit from the power crisis, like Calpine, an independent power producer, and Capstone Turbine, a smaller-capitalization company which is focused on utilizing a cleaner way to produce energy.

Q. Your fund's share price hit a six-month low on Jan. 8. Since then it is up about 12 percent. What has been going on?

A. Well, we have seen a nice bounce in the Nasdaq recently. And I think the market is looking ahead and realizes that these companies are not just California-focused. They march to their own drummer.

Q. Equity mutual funds that focus on one state are rare. What was the thinking behind creating this fund?

A. We wanted to take advantage of our resources as a large, West Coast-based money manager. And it is an asset to be close to your investments.
In addition, the California economy has traditionally grown at a faster pace than the country as a whole. 
And there are some underpinnings in California that make for good investments. One is the state's higher education system, which generates a great deal of brain power.
The second is Silicon Valley. Twenty-one percent of the nation's research-and-development dollars are spent in California. 
The third is the venture capital industry. About 40 percent of the venture capital money raised in the country is flowing into California-based companies. 

Q. You said that not all of your investments are in California-based companies. What are some of your out-of-state holdings?

A. We own Expeditors International, a freight-hauling and logistics company based in Washington State that benefits from a lot of traffic to and from California. Another example is Costco.

Q. Applied Micro Circuits and Veritas Software, two technology companies, are the biggest and fourth-biggest holdings in the fund, respectively. Both stocks are well down from their 52-week highs. Have you been adding to your positions?

A. We have not been adding to either position.
We have added to our holdings outside of technology. We have bought some Univision and added to some biotechnology holdings like Genentech and Amgen. We are quite optimistic about biotechnology. 
And we have been adding to positions in down-and-out firms like Mattel.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS; 
A Fight for Survival in the Broadband Wreckage

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SANTIAGO 

 BODY:
UP to its knees in uncollected bills from customers that resell its high-speed Internet connections, suffering from a battered stock price, relying on competitors to deliver its product and caught in a severe market downturn, Covad Communications may be facing a technology-sector version of the perfect storm.
 The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has become a case study in the tumultuous history of the market for broadband Internet access, a market spawned by the 1996 Telecommunications Act. 
 The law was intended to promote competition, and Covad and other start-ups raced in on its heels to offer faster and higher-capacity access as an alternative to the dribble of data allowed by standard modems. Covad and its rivals began aggressively selling digital subscriber line, or D.S.L., connections to Internet service providers, which in turn resell them to businesses and residential consumers.
But in October, 19 of its 250 customers defaulted on payments to the company. Some, like Flashcom Communications, Zyan Communications and Relay Point, filed for bankruptcy. Of the 274,000 D.S.L. lines that Covad installed that quarter, 92,000 were not paid for, and the shortfall spun Covad into crisis. 
Consumer demand for broadband is huge, of course, and will remain so for the industry's survivors. Analysts, investors and entrepreneurs agree on that. The question is whether Covad will be among those survivors. It clearly hopes so.
"I think the market overreacted," Chuck McMinn, Covad's chairman, said of the trouncing that Covad, a leader in the wholesale broadband market, took on Wall Street.
When the company missed third-quarter revenue projections last year by $21.8 million, or nearly 30 percent, its stock plummeted to just over $1 a share, from a high of $66 in March. On Friday, it closed at $3.72. 
And investors did not see it as an isolated case, giving a cold shoulder to its rivals as well. "I think they threw the baby out with the bath water, putting all the companies in the same bucket," Mr. McMinn said.
His company, he said, was and is on more solid ground than its precarious competitors or its insolvent customers.
Still, Covad, which has yet to make a profit, responded swiftly. It laid off 800 employees, one-quarter of its work force, and scrubbed plans to open an operations center in Alpharetta, Ga. Robert Knowling, its chief executive and former chairman, resigned, and the chief executive's post went to Frank Marshall, previously a general manager at Cisco Systems.
Mr. McMinn, one of three Covad founders and its first chief executive, left a year ago to found Certive, a company offering management services over broadband connections, but returned to Covad in November. "The layoffs and other steps were taken in reaction to the market's change in focus," he said. "At the end of 2000, the market decided it cared only about profitability. Any company that was not already profitable, they got very worried about."
By slashing operating costs and slowing capital spending, Mr. McMinn expects Covad to see profits by the end of next year. Analysts, while uncertain about Covad's future, say its greatest advantage is a cash reserve of more than $800 million.
"With a company in bad times, if you have enough cash to weather it out, and your competition doesn't, at the end of the day there are fewer people competing for a slice of the pie," said Clay Ryder, chief analyst at Zona Research in Redwood City, Calif. "And therefore there's more left for you. The question is: Can they survive on the resources they have to ultimately thrive at a later date?"
On Jan. 16, NorthPoint Communications, another D.S.L. wholesaler, gave up its piece of the pie and filed for bankruptcy after a merger with Verizon Communications fell through. The same day, Rhythms NetConnections, an Englewood, Colo., D.S.L. company, said it was cutting 450 jobs, 23 percent of its work force.
At the beginning, the future of D.S.L. looked not just rosy, but irresistible. D.S.L. connections promised speeds up to 50 times as fast as conventional modems. And because the service was always on, there were no more busy signals or waits for a connection.
Still, only 5 percent of Internet users now have broadband, by some estimates. Jupiter Media Metrix, a research firm, predicts that there will be 11.5 million D.S.L. users by 2005, up from 1.2 million last year.
"The economics of our business were so compelling," Mr. McMinn recalled, "that for a time the financial markets were willing to fund a parallel rollout of our services in 112 different metropolitan areas."
Building a D.S.L. network from scratch was considered unrealistic because it required an astronomical investment before ever selling a single subscription. But the Telecommunications Act required local phone companies to lease their existing infrastructure -- copper wire networks and switching control centers -- to competitors. In exchange, local companies that played by the new rules would be permitted by the Federal Communications Commission to enter the long-distance market.
ALTHOUGH it set off a gold rush, the convoluted arrangement had built-in problems, creating immediate nightmares for customers and, eventually, havoc for wholesalers.
For example, a customer who wants D.S.L. may call an Internet service provider, or I.S.P. The provider may then call Covad, which in turn passes the order along to the phone company leasing the wires.
"At every point there's the possibility that the information will lose a critical detail," explained Justin Beech, an analyst at DSL Reports in New York. "A misspelling of a street will cause the phone company to reject the order, and it has to go all the way back to the customer for a correction. Now you call up the phone company and say, 'What's the problem here?' And they say, 'You're not our customer; you have to talk with Covad.' And Covad says you have to talk to the I.S.P., and then the I.S.P. isn't picking up because they're concentrating on selling."
As a result, customers ordering D.S.L. through that chain of middlemen can sometimes wait months for a connection. The very phone companies leasing the wires, meanwhile, also sell D.S.L. service directly.
"Part of the problem is that the incumbent phone companies, like Pac Bell, didn't really want to sell that circuit to Covad and then Covad sells it to you. They'd rather just sell it right to you," said Mr. Ryder, the analyst. So D.S.L. companies are often at the mercy of competitors for delivering their service. This, some D.S.L. wholesalers have contended, leads phone companies to give their own customers priority for installation over leased connections.
Despite the incentive of gaining entry into long distance, many local companies are understandably reluctant to make things too easy for D.S.L. wholesalers vying for the same customers, experts say.
Even if there is no such prioritizing of installations by phone companies, "the most difficult part of this business is getting them to be a quality supplier that delivers on time," Mr. McMinn conceded.
On the other hand, he points to a recent deal with SBC Communications, which chose to regard Covad as a partner rather than as a competitor. "They have committed to buying $600 million worth of D.S.L. from Covad for their customers, and to make a $150 million equity investment in Covad," he said.
That big players like SBC have been sought as saviors by bruised D.S.L. contenders is a sign, some experts say, that the local phone companies will eventually own the D.S.L. market. In addition to deeper pockets, they enjoy the advantage of established brands.
"You've never heard of Covad, right?" said Jerry Grasso, spokesman for Epoch Internet, a service provider based in Costa Mesa, Calif. "You hear of companies like Pac Bell. Pac Bell is on the radio, on TV, in the paper. The amount of marketing money you have to spend on getting each new customer, it's almost more expensive than what the customers can bring in by signing up."
Add the competition posed by cable and wireless broadband, and many experts say suppliers will be forced into a major consolidation. "I think what you are going to see is a lot of companies ripe for acquisition," Mr. Grasso said.

HEADLINE: Think Nasdaq. Now Double the Pain. 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: MILAN 

 BODY:
EVEN amid the intoxication that surrounded Internet start-ups early last year, Silvio Scaglia's experience was an eye-opener.
 As co-founder and chief executive of E.biscom, Mr. Scaglia had little more than a good reputation and a bold plan. Working in offices about a block away from the Teatro alla Scala, he proposed building fiber optic networks in Italy's biggest cities that would reach directly into homes and businesses. 
 E.biscom had no network, no sales and no expectation of turning a profit for at least three years. Yet in March, the company raised $1.5 billion in fresh cash. 
It did so by going public here on the Nuovo Mercato, a fledgling stock exchange for new companies that was less than a year old at the time. Most Italians had never invested in stocks, let alone in little-known start-ups. But mesmerized by the rise of American companies like Yahoo and Cisco Systems, they oversubscribed E.biscom's huge offering by 26-fold.
Today, investors are far less euphoric. Mirroring the panicky crash of American technology stocks traded on the Nasdaq market, shares of E.biscom now trade 25 percent below their offering price.
"In March 2000, we were swimming with the tide, and everything seemed extremely easy," Mr. Scaglia said. "Today we are swimming against the tide."
In truth, it is a bit more like a riptide. After decades of paying little heed to entrepreneurs and new companies, European investors and financial institutions embraced American-style start-up capitalism in the last three years as zealously as converts to a new religion.
Now they are trying to decide if they got to the temple too late or whether it was all a false credo. The Nuovo Mercato and the Frankfurt Neuer Markt have plunged about 70 percent from their peaks last spring, and the Nouveau Marche in Paris is down 60 percent. In Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels, smaller "new markets" have also withered.
American investors have been there, too, of course. The Nasdaq has lost almost 50 percent in the last year, though it has rebounded a bit recently. But European investors -- individuals and institutions -- had never before put money into companies that often had little more than promising technologies. Now the question is whether their nascent enthusiasm for investing in start-ups will recover or die on the vine.
Europe's traditional stock exchanges started creating these markets about four years ago, hoping to replicate the Nasdaq and to stem the flow of entrepreneurial talent to the United States, where finding capital was easy. There was also hope of providing money for job-creating companies that might become Europe's answers to Amazon.com or Cisco.
Though these European companies faced little scrutiny from regulators, compared with new offerings in the United States and Britain, the reaction was thunderous. Inexperienced individual investors -- discouraged by the meager interest rates they were receiving on government bonds -- clawed for a piece of every new offering. 
Banks fell over themselves to underwrite new stock offerings from dozens of dot-com start-ups and software companies and from older, family-owned companies whose owners simply wanted to cash in. Among those in the parade: EM.TV and Merchandising, which bought the Jim Henson Company last year, but is now struggling to survive; J. P. Tod's, the Italian shoe company; Lycos Europe, the Internet search engine company; and Jazztel, an upstart Spanish telecommunications carrier.
More than a few entrepreneurs became overnight billionaires, at least on paper. At one point, the market value of a two-year-old Italian Internet company called Tiscali S.p.A. was almost as high as that of Fiat, Italy's automobile and industrial conglomerate.
By far the biggest new exchange is the three-year-old Neuer Markt in Frankfurt, which trades 338 companies with a combined market capitalization of $111 billion. The four-year old Nouveau Marche in Paris has more than 150 companies with a combined market value of more than $20 billion. The Nuovo Mercato here has only 40 companies, but with a market about equal to that of the Paris market.
London actually led the way in 1995, when it created the Alternative Investments Market, or AIM, for small companies. AIM now has more than 500 listings, but it is dominated by companies with tiny valuations, from restaurants to courier services. As a result, AIM's total market capitalization is about on par only with that of Paris and Milan. 
Other European exchanges have been slower to catch on. The Nuevo Mercado in Madrid has only 12 stocks, most of which had already listed on other exchanges. And Easdaq, an electronic trading network modeled after Nasdaq, based in Brussels and billed as a pan-European exchange, has been a disappointment. After a strong start in 1996, Easdaq has steadily lost ground to the national exchanges.
Now, 10 months into the downturn, all the fledgling exchanges are scrambling, both to survive and to establish themselves as pan-European markets. Deutsche Borse A.G., the parent of the Frankfurt Neuer Markt, failed last year to merge with the London Stock Exchange, for example. Despite gloom surrounding financial institutions, Deutsche Borse is trying to raise nearly $1 billion by going public next month.
Euronext, which was formed last year through the merger of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges, is trying to fold its three "new markets" into a new entity called NextEconomy. Exchange officials also hope to put all three on a common trading system later this year, though the markets will remain legally separate and have slightly different rules. Madrid and Milan are weighing whether to cast their lot with Frankfurt or Paris.
NONE of Europe's other new markets grew as explosively as Frankfurt's Neuer Markt, and none are now more shellshocked. From the start in October 1997 through last year, companies on the Neuer Markt accounted for 56 percent of the market value and 72 percent of the trading volume on Europe's new-company exchanges.
At its peak last spring, the German frenzy for new stocks seemed insatiable. Previously obscure entrepreneurs had become celebrities, routinely appearing on television. Banks were bringing a constant stream of new companies to the market: Internet bookshops like Bucher.de and Buch.de, Web-based travel agencies, advertising agencies, dating agencies. A few start-ups were even American companies that went to Germany because investors there were willing to pay higher prices than those in the United States.
"It was like a baker that was always sold out," said Lothar Mark, chairman of Gontard & Metallbank, a small but busy underwriter in Frankfurt. "As soon as you baked the next batch of rolls, people were lining up to buy them. There weren't any rolls left."
Mr. Mark should know. Gontard & Metallbank, formed from the merger of two tiny banks that had fallen on hard times, managed 13 offerings last year. Of those, eight are now below their offering price and five are still above. Mr. Mark took his bank public last year, but its shares are since down about 36 percent.
"The Neuer Markt was a new toy," said Holger Tim, chief executive of Berliner Effektengesellschaft, parent of a company that acts as a market maker for many German stocks. "Investors saw it as 100 percent safe, a money-making machine."
Statistics provide a glimpse of the transformation. In 1997, only 8.9 percent of German adults owned stocks or equity-based mutual funds, according to the Deutschen Aktieninstitut, a research group in Frankfurt. By the end of 2000, that share had more than doubled, to 19.3 percent. (In the United States, about 30 percent of the population owns stock, directly or indirectly.)
Comparable statistics for other countries are hard to obtain, but they probably lag behind those for Germany. Though the Paris Nouveau Marche opened a year before the Neuer Markt, it never gathered as much steam or soared as high, no doubt because the French have never liked imitating American capitalism. In Spain, disagreement and uncertainty among financial institutions delayed the start of the Nuevo Mercado until last April, when technology stocks were heading down sharply. In Amsterdam, investors were shocked and embittered by the flop of World Online, whose founder quietly sold part of her stake to private investors shortly before the company went public.
BUT in Germany, the fever spread to millions in all walks of life. More than 50 banks jumped into the business of underwriting new stock offerings. Television shows about new stocks became so popular that statements made by their hosts and guests routinely moved markets. At least a half-dozen glossy new business magazines were started, from Teleborse to Bizz.
Volker Meier, an unemployed economist who grew up in the formerly Communist east, devoted himself nearly full time to investing in stocks and bonds to stretch out his life savings. Thinking he was cautious, he invested a small percentage of his money in a mutual fund for Neuer Markt companies. To his delight, the investment nearly doubled in value last year. When it began to sink, he stayed in after the fund manager declared his continued optimism.
"Things seemed very exaggerated and overblown at the time, but I figured this man was much cleverer than I was," recalled Mr. Meier, who is 54.
Today, his fund investment is worth one-fifth its value a year ago.
Almost incredibly, stock valuations in Germany, measured by price-to-earnings ratios, were sharply higher than on the Nasdaq. Thomas Effler, an analyst at Commerzbank, estimated the average P/E ratio in the market's index was nearly 50 percent higher for the Neuer Markt as recently as December. It was little wonder that the exaggerated euphoria set the stage for an exaggerated decline.
Stefan Powels has a perfect view of the new shopping and office towers at Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, where the Berlin Wall once severed the city -- and a perfect view of the trading decline.
Mr. Powels runs a two-month-old Internet trading center for Wallstreet:Online, one of 30 Internet-based brokerage firms that have sprouted in Germany in the last three years. His center has all the latest technology for day-traders -- workstations with sleek double screens; software that lets amateurs see not only current prices but also the volumes of shares being offered; instant access to reams of analytical data and news.
But on a recent morning, the trading center was nearly empty. "Customers just say they don't want to trade anymore," Mr. Powels said. "I expect the next two months will be very difficult. We won't hire any more people, and we will open up fewer accounts than perhaps we had expected."
Mr. Meier, the economist, was among those who showed up recently at one of Wallstreet:Online's regular investment seminars. "We are victims of the media, the fund managers and the analysts," he complained. "There were never any analysts who said we ought to get out, but the fundamentals were clear. For me, it's a fraud."
Ruby Ma, who stages her own investment seminars in Berlin, recalled how all the major banks continued to publish bullish forecasts for EM.TV until the company suddenly revised its results and said it was seriously overburdened by debt. "Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank, all of them said EM.TV was going to keep going up," Ms. Ma said. "Then, when it suddenly went into crisis, they said 'sell.' But before that, there were no sell recommendations."
MAKING matters even worse for investors was misleading behavior at several companies. EM.TV, whose stock price shot up more than 11,000 percent, made worldwide headlines last year buying Henson, renowned for the Muppets, and a 50 percent stake in the Formula One racing organization. Today, the shares are down more than 90 percent and the company is in a desperate struggle to survive.
How did it happen? EM.TV's hyperkinetic founder, Thomas Haffa, dazzled investors by announcing a seemingly endless stream of deals to acquire rights to children's television programming.
But the pace of acquisitions left EM.TV swooning in debt. It also employed dubious accounting, which inflated its revenues and profits. In October, the company said it would have to restate its first-half earnings. In December, Mr. Haffa acknowledged that operating profits for the year would be one-tenth of what the company had predicted just a few weeks earlier. Mr. Haffa's brother, Florian, resigned as chief financial officer, acknowledging that he had lost the trust of shareholders.
Last week, Thomas Haffa's lawyer said in an interview that his client secretly sold 200,000 shares of EM.TV stock last February, violating rules that prohibit executives from selling shares within six months after a public stock offering.
EM.TV now faces an avalanche of shareholder suits, which are also almost unprecedented in Germany. But even if the shareholders win, they may not receive much compensation. German law also makes it difficult for shareholders to claim damages, even if executives made demonstrably misleading or false statements. And class action suits do not exist, which means that lawyers have to file individual suits on behalf of each client.
"Totally inadequate," summed up Daniela Bergdolt, a lawyer in Munich who is suing EM.TV on behalf of hundreds of shareholders. "The amount of work involved is enormous, and the merits of each case have to be scrutinized individually."
German investors have suffered through other shocks as well. The founders of Infomatec, a software company in Augsburg, are now in jail as German prosecutors investigate accusations of insider trading and fraud. Gigabell, an Internet company whose founder touted deals that did not exist, has collapsed. Adpepper, an Internet advertising firm, warned that its results would be lower than expected less than one month after its public offering in September.
NOT surprisingly, the barrage of bad news has raised a storm of criticism about lax oversight and shoddy practices. Until this month, company founders did not have to tell investors if they bought or sold their company's shares. German law also makes it difficult to sue companies for damages stemming from false statements.
Under pressure to clean up its image, the Deutsche Borse is tightening up its rules. It now requires top executives at Neuer Markt companies to disclose any transactions in their company's stock. It also tightened requirements for the way companies report their results, tailoring demands to individual industries. Unlike some of Europe's other markets -- including Germany's main exchange for big companies -- the Neuer Markt already requires companies to use either American-style Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or the fairly similar International Accounting Standards. 
"Four years ago, only about 10 companies, if that many, used I.A.S. accounting," said Rainer Riess, head of primary markets at Deutsche Borse. "It was a big issue whether it would be possible at all."
Mr. Riess conceded that the rules governing Neuer Markt companies were still less stringent than those in the United States. But, he said, "we are tightening up, screw by screw." 
Tougher regulations are only part of the story. In the heat of the craze for new stocks, German banks and even some Wall Street firms pumped out new issues with ever less regard for quality. 
DG Bank, which serves as an umbrella bank for about one-third of Germany's community-owned savings banks, was lead manager on 52 offerings. Of the 20 initial stock issues it managed last year, only three are above water.
Rolf Michael Betz, head of investment banking at DG Bank, said his institution had done its best to scrutinize new offerings. "We perform extensive due diligence, not only hiring accountants and lawyers to make sure that the prospectus is in order," he said. "We also have a team of analysts that scrutinizes the business plan. The problem is that these industries are so new that it is very hard to know what will happen."
Shareholder advocates sharply disagree. "Let's speak clearly: some of the worst offerings did not come from obscure little stock brokerage houses," said Ms. Bergdolt, the Munich lawyer who represents one of Germany's biggest shareholder advocacy organizations. "All the banks were involved, and they were all motivated by the fact that the higher the offering price was, the higher their profit would be." 
Ms. Bergdolt said it could be years before the banks and the markets regained their credibility with investors. "The damage that has been done here goes beyond just the Neuer Markt to the economy as a whole," she said. "The wave of new companies provided an important new source of jobs, and that wave has now been stopped dead in its tracks. It is a terrible loss."
ITALY has had only slightly better luck with its new market, as the tale of E.biscom shows.
Francesco Micheli, the company's chairman and other co-founder, is a walking synthesis of old and new Italy. Now 62, he built his career as an investment banker and played a central role in Olivetti's hostile takeover of Telecom Italia. A passionate art collector and pianist, he works in an office at E.biscom that includes oil paintings from his private collection and a magnificent electronic piano. "This was a way of bringing a part of my home with me," he said.
When he and Mr. Scaglia created E.biscom in 1998, Mr. Scaglia, once chief executive of Omnitel, an Italian mobile telephone operator, was convinced that Italy was ripe for a leap into advanced telecommunications. 
E.biscom would build fiber optic networks in major Italian cities that would be independent of the telephone network and run directly into individual buildings. They would have so much capacity that even ordinary customers would be able to get movies on demand and many new video Internet services. 
"Four years ago, it would have been impossible to take the company public in Italy," Mr. Scaglia said. "Even two years ago, we had very different plans."
E.biscom's principal draw was Mr. Scaglia's record at Omnitel and his willingness to risk his own money: he and Mr. Michaeli invested $10 million each and pledged not to sell their shares for six years.
Their timing -- last March -- was perfect. Milan's Nuovo Mercato had been a late arrival, having started in June 1999, and many Italians feared that they were about to miss out.
They had also been electrified by the public offering of Tiscali, the brash Internet service provider whose shares had soared from 46 euros to 1,300. Yet the public offering of E.biscom was even more remarkable. The founders and other early investors held on to 80 percent of the shares, while raising 1.7 billion euros (about $1.5 billion) in new cash. Today, E.biscom has built fiber optic links to several thousand corporate customers, and its sales reached 46 million euros by the end of 2000.
Mr. Scaglia hopes to generate positive cash flow, not counting interest and depreciation, by 2003. But profits are a long way off.
Italian exchange officials are convinced that Italian attitudes toward new companies and entrepreneurs have changed permanently. The watershed, they said, was the rise of Tiscali, a start-up from Sardinia that is now one of Europe's biggest Internet service providers. 
"Tiscali changed everything," said Maria Pierdicchi, director of the Nuovo Mercato. When the Borsa Italiana, Milan's main exchange, first tried to start a new market in early 1999, she said, banks and financial institutions were overwhelmingly dubious. "People were avoiding us," Ms. Pierdicchi said. "They said it's a risky project, that Italy doesn't have entrepreneurs or venture capitalists. Tiscali showed that there were entrepreneurs in Italy, and a lot of people saw that if he could make it, then maybe they could make it, too."
Oliver Novick and Elserino Piol experienced the shift in thinking from the vantage point of venture capitalists. Mr. Novick, an American, and Mr. Piol, who had been in charge of Olivetti's venture capital activities, started a venture fund called Pino Ventures in October 1998. In their first attempt to raise money from investors, the two were barely able to get $22 million. But they had the good fortune to back Tiscali, which was able to capitalize on Internet mania and surge to success. 
When they started a second fund in May 1999, they raised $500 million. Investors included scores of big European banks as well as American companies from Microsoft to Cisco.
Now the outlook has changed entirely. Venture capital firms earn their profits by being able to exit their investments, and Pino was able to pay back all its first-round investors with the profits from Tiscali's public offering. But with the Nuovo Mercato down about 70 percent from its peak, prospects for new public offerings range from difficult to impossible. "The next year will be difficult," Mr. Novick said.
BUBBLES are bursting in most European markets. In Madrid, the Nuevo Mercado has been unable to generate any initial public offerings. In Germany, at least 25 companies have postponed or delayed plans to go public. And because so many newly listed companies are a long way from making a profit, the inability to raise more money has led some to the edge of bankruptcy.
"It is sensationally awful," said Florian Homm, founder of Value Management and Research, a small company that invests in new stock offerings around Europe. "It makes the Crash of 1929 look like a joke. We're going to get slammed."
Yet for all the unhappiness, few investors seem ready to abandon stocks and return to their old ways. Even in Germany. For one thing, government bonds pay low interest rates today. Beyond that, investors generally say they knew there were risks in investing and that the huge price rises would not last forever.
"People really didn't pay attention," said Jurgen Kramer, 31, a publishing executive in Augsburg who started an investment club just as the Neuer Markt was peaking. "They just wanted to subscribe in public offerings, regardless of what the company did or its management. We didn't want to hear anything to the contrary."
Rudiger von Rosen, director of the Deutschen Aktieninstitut in Frankfurt, a research institute financed by the investment industry, said it was significant that Germans continued to invest in equity-based mutual funds even as the market headed south. "German investors have demonstrated a remarkable maturity in the past year," he wrote this month, after publishing a survey of investor attitudes. "Private households have not allowed themselves to be disconcerted by the temporary decline in the market."
That remains to be seen. But Mr. Kramer is ready to vouch for the theory. "We are absolutely buying right now," he said. "We see this correction as a good chance to get back in."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Andrew J. Knuth and Edmund H. Nicklin Jr.; 
Westport Small Cap Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
ANDREW J. KNUTH and Edmund H. Nicklin Jr. work closely together as co-managers of the $574 million Westport Small Cap fund. Very closely.
 "He sits about eight feet away from me, so I couldn't avoid him if I wanted to," Mr. Knuth said of Mr. Nicklin. "There's a glass partition between our offices, and we have to look at each other all day long." 
 But they don't always have to listen to each other. Mr. Nicklin noted that his office had a door. 
Whatever the logistics, shareholders appear to have benefited. The fund returned 24.9 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Jan. 25, compared with 9.1 percent for its peer group of small blend funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
Mr. Knuth, 62, and Mr. Nicklin, 54, are long-term contrarian investors who look for bargains among United States companies with market capitalizations of less than $1.75 billion. "We try to buy good businesses when other people don't want them," Mr. Knuth said. "That means a lot of risk has been taken out of the price."
They divide their purchases between the fund, which is open to new investors, and $2.8 billion in institutional accounts, which are not.
The managers work in their Westport, Conn., office with two analysts to choose the 60 or so stocks in the fund. Unlike many other money managers, they do not use computer screens to pick investments. Instead, they rely on a combined 55 years of experience to find solid small companies that they believe will improve their profitability and stock prices.
Such companies abound today, Mr. Knuth said. "Because of the relatively poor performance of small-cap value stocks over the last few years," he said, "we're seeing many opportunities."
First, the managers seek out niche businesses. These may be regional or local banks, semiconductor companies with proprietary designs or radio broadcasters with government licenses for specific areas. "If you don't buy a niche business," Mr. Nicklin said, "the bigger companies that have economies of scale are likely to erode your profitability and your returns over time."
That focus often means that portfolio companies become takeover targets. Seven holdings were acquired in 2000, and another, the Fritz Companies, agreed this month to be acquired by United Parcel Service. "Virtually every company in the portfolio is a legitimate acquisition opportunity for bigger companies," Mr. Nicklin said. "Acquisitions give us the opportunity for value-added returns that we don't pay for."
They compare a company's current stock price with what they believe it will be in two years, given their forecast of earnings or cash flow. Typically, the managers buy when a company's difficulties -- real or perceived -- have driven down its stock price. Their goal is a 50 percent increase in price over two years.
Mr. Knuth said they evaluate management's plans to improve profitability, by selling unprofitable divisions, for example, or via mergers. 
The fund sells shares when a company's stock price exceeds the managers' two-year price target or when the company's fundamentals deteriorate. Because of the fund's long-term focus, turnover averages a measly 10 percent a year. 
The fund has owned shares of Universal Health Services of King of Prussia, Pa., a big operator of acute-care and psychiatric hospitals, for more than 10 years. The managers bought more of the stock in March, at an average price of $42.27, after the company announced disappointing third-quarter earnings. "At that point, it sold for four times cash flow," Mr. Knuth said, adding that he believed it was worth 8 to 10 times cash flow. The earnings shortfall was created by health maintenance organizations' payment problems, compounded by staffing costs, he said; those issues have been resolved. 
He expects Universal's earnings to grow 20 percent a year over two years. The stock is now at $83.69.
Another holding is Precision Castparts, a Portland, Ore., company that makes castings and forgings, primarily for aircraft engines. Mr. Knuth expects cost savings from Precision's 1999 acquisition of Wyman-Gordon, which produced parts for the aerospace industry. Precision also supplies component parts to the utility industry, for gas turbines that generate electricity.
Mr. Knuth expects the company to have annual earnings growth of 15 percent for the next two years. The fund began buying shares last April at an average price of $21.03; they now trade at $37.06. 
THE managers also like IMS Health of Westport, Conn., a health care database company that supplies prescription information to drug companies. "No other company has the scale and capacity to deliver this information to drug companies at a better price," Mr. Nicklin said.
Early last year, to create an Internet presence, IMS proposed a complex transaction with a smaller company, the TriZetto Group, involving a reverse acquisition. The stock fell from the mid-$20's, and the managers began buying shares in March, at an average price of $16.20. "IMS was a very attractive business, and we felt this transaction would not be approved by the shareholders," Mr. Nicklin said.
The merger was abandoned in favor of a simpler transaction with the same company, and a new chief executive, David M. Thomas, took over last November. The stock closed on Friday at $24.94.

HEADLINE: Montana Republicans Seek to Ease Environmental Laws 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont. 

 BODY:
Citing steadily declining jobs in traditional industries like mining, logging and energy development, Montana is preparing to change its environmental regulations to make them more favorable to business.
 The current efforts are the most ambitious by any state to speed the process of obtaining construction and operating permits, and they have set off an old-fashioned fight between environmentalists and business interests. But both sides agree on one thing: the state's actions have taken on added force and importance in light of President Bush's promise to review the Clinton administration's environmental policies and the willingness of the nominee for interior secretary, Gale A. Norton, to let the states assume more power to regulate themselves. 
 "The concept is not new, but I haven't seen other states do something as comprehensively as Montana," said Paula Carrell, state program director for the Sierra Club. 
The changes proposed for Montana, in at least eight bills being drafted, have the support of the new governor, Judy Martz, a Republican, and Republican leaders of the Legislature, who say the Republican majority in both chambers almost assures passage of the bills. 
In particular, two state laws are under review, the Montana Environmental Policy Act and the Montana Major Facility Siting Act, which regulates the construction and operation of power plants. Both laws are nearly 30 years old. 
"The laws are so vague," said Don Allen, executive director of the Western Environmental Trade Association, a coalition of industry groups. The Montana Environmental Policy Act "and other things are used so widely that they play a role in keeping our economy from what it needs to be." 
Governor Martz agrees. "The process needs to be changed," she said, adding that only the regulations for gaining permits would be changed, not laws that protect the air and water.
For example, some permits could be granted after 90 days of review rather than a year. Another change under consideration before the Legislature would allow the state to issue a permit after the 90-day deadline even if all environmental reviews had not been completed.
Environmentalists who have fought long and expensive battles over mine cleanups and timber harvesting are not optimistic that they can stop the initiatives. "State agencies will be forced to act prior to having all the information they need to make an adequate decision," said Anne Hedges, program director for the Montana Environmental Information Center, a watchdog group. 
Supporters of the legislation contend that the state's current environmental regulations make it too expensive for companies to operate profitably, driving away high-paying jobs and discouraging out-of-state businesses from expanding into Montana. They also contend that the regulations have helped drive up Montana's electricity costs by discouraging the construction of power plants. Utility rates for consumers have doubled in the last year.
The environmental groups are challenging the new measures as unnecessary, saying they could endanger not only the quality of the state's air and water but also its economy. They say that Montana ranks eighth in the country in per capita job creation, and that the state's 5 percent unemployment rate, though slightly higher than the national average, is relatively low and has been falling. 
Yet the Republican lawmakers want Montanans to believe that the state is in dire trouble, said Thomas Power, chairman of the economics department at the University of Montana. "Their whole premise is wrong," Mr. Power said. "All they know is they are losing jobs in mining, milling and smelting; therefore they must be hurting. But the industrial base of the country is evaporating. These people are staring into the rearview mirror, lost in fantasies tied to the past." 
Tourism and recreation, the environmentalists note, are fueling job growth; service industry jobs jumped to 119,571 in 1999 from 82,684 in 1990. At the same time, the number of jobs in farming, forestry and mining fell. Mining jobs alone dropped to 7,081 in 1999 from 8,977 in 1990. While state income from natural resource industries has fallen or remained even, income from the recreation and health industries has risen substantially. 
The environmentalists say economic declines have less to do with environmental regulations than with the state's tax policy, the quality of schools, Montana's 1997 deregulation of electrical power -- and the enormous financial burden of cleaning up defunct mining sites. 
"To get out of the bottom of the barrel, they want to strip the protections away," said John Wilson, conservation director of Montana Trout Unlimited. "But that just puts out a welcome mat, particularly to the natural resource industry of coal, oil and gas." 
"It sends the same message to George Bush, as well," he added. 
That is fine with the Republicans, who note that Montana has consistently ranked low in wages. In 1988, Montana ranked 44th in per capita income; by 1998, the state had fallen to 47th, with an average per capita personal income of $21,229. 
"We're always at the bottom of the barrel," said State Senator Lorents Grosfield of Big Timber, Mont.
Democratic lawmakers say they share the concerns of the environmental groups, while bowing to what appears to be the inevitable.
"We may need to look at the process to see if it needs to be modernized," Kim Gillan of Billings, the House minority leader, said, "but only as long as it keeps to the substance of the state environmental laws." Nonetheless, she added, the Republican majorities in both chambers might make it too difficult for Democrats to contain their efforts. Republicans control the House, 58 to 42, and the Senate, 31 to 19. 
Environmentalists fear that other states will follow Montana's lead, emboldened by a new administration in Washington that is more sympathetic to natural resource industries than the Clinton administration was. 
So far, though, there is no sign of that. Officials in Idaho and Wyoming -- states that have traditionally relied on mining and logging -- have said that they are not replicating Montana's model. 
Ms. Carrell of the Sierra Club also said she knew of no other state as active as Montana in trying to loosen environmental regulations. Still, she added, "it could be that Montana just stuck its head out of the hole first."
"We're expecting a lot more of this stuff to surface," she said, "especially now with new sympathies in Washington."

The New South: Old Times There Are Not Forgotten

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
IN 1956, with little debate or public notice, a handful of men at the helm of Georgia's government decided to change the state flag, altering Southern history in a way that once seemed permanent. They added the Confederate battle cross to the flag, turning a state symbol into an officially sanctioned tool of protest that could be waved at the Democratic National Convention in defiance of federal desegregation orders.
 On Wednesday, again with little debate or public notice, a handful of men at the helm of Georgia's government decided it was time to undo what their predecessors had done. With only a few hours of advance warning, they persuaded the state House of Representatives to approve a new flag designed behind closed doors, one in which the Confederate symbol is reduced to a tiny historical artifact at the bottom edge, amid a ribbon of other flags that have flown over Georgia. 
 If the manner in which statehouse business gets done in the South hasn't changed much over the years, the differences between the two flags themselves very much reflect changes in southern society that have taken place between 1956 and now. Just as the symbolism of a flag is usually more important than its aesthetic values, this new flag -- assuming it is adopted by the state Senate this week, as expected -- is very much a mental map of the contemporary South. And the long, winding path taken by Georgia's leaders to reach agreement on what this symbol should look like is woven into its composition.
The flag designers in 2001, unlike those 45 years ago, are both white and black, and to reach agreement they consented to compromises they would have found unthinkable even a few years ago. The two sides found common ground by recognizing the emotional heart of their opponent's argument: Blacks acknowledged the profound attachment to the Confederacy held by many native Southern whites, while whites acknowledged that flaunting that attachment from every flagpole was deeply offensive to those with a different view of Southern heritage. 
By successfully seeing the same history through other people's eyes, the House leaders moved the largest state in the old South a giant step farther away from the Civil War that has obsessed it for a century and a half.
"If I had been in the legislature in 1956, the truth is I probably would have voted for that flag they passed back then," said Larry Walker, the House majority leader. "Even now I still have deep, deep feelings for my Southern heritage and for the Confederacy, which for a lot of us was the defining moment of the South. But now I think it is time we started to move away from that moment."
Mr. Walker is a white Democrat from Perry, former Senator Sam Nunn's hometown in central Georgia, who until recently was unalterably opposed to removing the Confederate symbol from the flag. For years, his opposition to a change, and that of his fellow rural Democrats, was the reason the flag remained, even as black colleagues tried to persuade him that, to them, it was a degrading reminder of white supremacy.
But over the years, he said, those arguments gained weight in his mind, aided by the growing threats of economic boycotts of the state and the behind-the-scenes persuasion of Gov. Roy E. Barnes. On Tuesday, Mr. Walker told the House that his decision to support a new flag was the hardest he had made in 28 years as a legislator but that he believed it was past time to consider "the Georgians who were forced here, and who are just now beginning to share in the wonderful bounty of this country; Georgians who at least until recently have received little respect and much ridicule and deriding."
But Mr. Walker's change of heart was not an unconditional surrender. He told his fellow negotiators that he would not accept a flag completely shorn of Confederate symbolism. And that posed a problem for Tyrone Brooks, a prominent black state representative from Atlanta, who has worked relentlessly for 23 years to rid the Georgia flag of its dominating Confederate emblem. He has led marches against it, called it the "Georgia swastika" and helped keep it off the sites of the 1996 Olympics.
THIS time, however, sensing that his goal was nearly in reach, Mr. Brooks and another leading black legislator, Calvin Smyre of Columbus, agreed that the object of their vilification could remain on the flag, in reduced form and in historical context.
"What I finally had to acknowledge was that Confederate history is a part of our history," Mr. Brooks said. "We cannot erase it, and it needs to be preserved for history's sake. Just like I have no intention of removing the statues of Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jackson, because as long as they're there, they will help us remember not to repeat our history."
Initially, some of Mr. Brooks's black colleagues in the House were angrily against any trace of the Confederacy remaining on the flag, but they ceased their opposition when it became clear that it would cause the compromise plan for revision to fail outright. 
In that sense, they traveled the same path as legislators in South Carolina last year, who agreed to lower the Confederate battle flag from the statehouse dome, but only after a smaller version was placed on a less prominent flagpole on the Capitol grounds.
In Mississippi, where race relations are a bit more raw, legislators have been unable to make that journey on their own, and recently decided to let voters choose a new flag in an April referendum. Many Georgia leaders believe that was a terrible mistake, and hope that Mississippi voters at least can learn from Georgia's example.
"There comes a time in your life when you realize you can't duck the real issues anymore," said Mr. Smyre. "You have to look across the table and realize that just because someone has a different view of history doesn't mean they hate you."

Overcoming the Dark Side

BYLINE:  By Rick Gladstone 

 BODY:
The blackouts in California may be chilling its economy and giving people second thoughts about moving there. But the power crisis was not a big deterrent to Integra Realty Resources, the nation's leading real estate appraisal firm, which has just ranked San Diego, Sacramento and Orange County among the best places for property investments. 
 In its Viewpoint 2001 annual ranking, Integra said San Diego was the best place to invest in suburban office space, Sacramento was No. 3 and Orange County was No. 10. Orange County and Sacramento were also among the best 10 places to invest in downtown office space, and San Diego was among the top 10 for industrial real estate investments. By contrast, some cities with plenty of power, like Pittsburgh, Memphis and Cleveland, fared badly in Integra's ranking. 
 Sean Hutchinson, president of Integra, said the appraisal was done in late 2000, and "we went to print past the time the whole energy thing blew up." 
Obviously, he said, "in the case of California, it's impossible to run a real estate building if you can't get energy."
"You know, dark buildings don't sell," he added. "But I have to trust that in some way there will be an adequate response to this crisis." Rick Gladstone

HEADLINE: Why Criticize New Arrivals Just for Being White? 

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Two years ago we moved with our child to a co-op just outside Morningside Heights, typical of the ones described in "A Vanishing World" (Jan. 7). We love the neighborhood and have made friends with many families who share our preference for raising children in a dynamic environment. We shop locally, we eat locally and we rely on neighborhood playgrounds. Yet, according to sentiments expressed in the article, our presence is detrimental due to our economic class and even the color of our skin, which is white. What is missing in this misguided argument is that good neighbors come in every color and class.

Watching for Signs of a Rebound

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
It was another tepid week for the markets as investors appeared to be in a holding pattern awaiting this week's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers. 
 There were signs that the economy was rebounding from a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter. 
Preliminary retail sales figures surged for January, and General Motors and DaimlerChrysler reported unexpectedly strong consumer demand for the month. 
 Warnings about first-quarter earnings continued to pile up, coming this time from blue-chip companies like Dell Computer, American Express, McDonald's, DuPont and Corning. But those gloomy forecasts seemed to have already been factored into Wall Street's calculations as the markets finished up modestly for the week. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500 led the way, ending at 1,354.95, up 12.40 points or 0.9 percent. The Dow industrials also rose, finishing at 10,659.98, up 72.39 points or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq climbed to 2,781.30, up 10.92 points or 0.4 percent.
 The modest rally in the equity markets took some of the steam out of the Treasury markets. Falling prices meant that the bellwether 10-year Treasury note ended the week with a yield of 5.26 percent, up from 5.16 percent the previous week. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Princeton to Replace Loans With Student Scholarships 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
As American students take on ever-larger mountains of debt to help pay for college, Princeton University said yesterday that it would replace student loans with scholarships so that its undergraduates eligible for financial aid would not have to worry about paying back thousands of dollars for their education. 
 Next year, Princeton students will be charged $26,160 for tuition, and undergraduates will pay $33,613 a year for tuition, room and board, a 3 percent increase. 
 Princeton said it would use the bounty from gifts and from its growing endowment -- now about $8 billion -- to expand scholarships for all students eligible for financial aid beginning this fall. It also plans to increase aid for graduate students. 
The university said the no-loan program and other financial aid improvements for undergraduates would cost it more than $5 million next year, while improving graduate support would cost more than $6 million.
Princeton's decision to reduce student indebtedness is likely to put pressure on other elite colleges and universities competing not just in academic programs but also in real-life economics for the best students. 
"This is an extraordinary gesture," said Arthur Levine, president of Columbia Teachers College. In the last two decades, he said, "there has been good support for poorer students, and wealthy students could afford to pay. But the only way middle-class students could afford to attend these colleges was by taking out huge loans."
"Every Ivy League university is going to have to try to match this if they want to compete for the best of the middle-class students," he added.
This is the second time in three years that Princeton, one of the wealthiest universities in the United States, has moved to improve financial aid for undergraduates. In 1998, it substituted grants for loans for its lowest-income students, from families earning less than $46,500. It also altered the formula it used to calculate a family's ability to pay for college so that middle-income students would be eligible for more aid.
Harvard and Yale were among the universities that followed with similar programs, although many other colleges and universities decided they could not afford to match Princeton's plan. 
Princeton, like other colleges, has traditionally provided students deemed eligible for financial aid (based on family income and assets) with a mix of loans and grants to supplement their own payments. 
Across the United States, more and more aid has been provided in the form of loans, especially for middle-income families. Twenty years ago, loans were used to pay for about 40 percent of a college education; today, that figure has jumped to about 60 percent. 
Don Betterton, Princeton's director of undergraduate financial aid, said that graduates of four-year colleges would leave campus this year with average debt of $15,000 to $20,000. Such debt affects student decisions about whether to go to graduate school and what careers to pursue, he added. 
Randall Smith, a freshman from Anchorage, said, "I am planning to go on to graduate school, so it will be nice not having a large debt from my undergraduate years starting out." He said, "I'll have some from the loans that I took out from this year, but besides that, I will be saving about $12,000." 
Princeton said that about 40 percent of its freshmen receive financial aid, and nearly two-thirds of the aid recipients -- or about a quarter of the freshmen class -- borrow to help cover their Princeton bills. 
Princeton freshmen borrowed an average of $2,615 this year. That is significantly lower than the $4,000 average loan taken out by this year's seniors, who were not covered when Princeton said that it would expand its financial aid three years ago, beginning with incoming students.
Mr. Betterton said that Princeton's new policy should make it possible for students to graduate without any debt, although most students would still be expected to contribute something. Princeton sets the amount it expects families and students to pay at a level it believes they can afford, based on the family income and assets and on what a student can earn working part time and during the summers. Families will still have the option of borrowing to pay their share of the bill. 
Princeton also said yesterday that it would reduce the amount students would be expected to contribute from their savings, and would increase grants to pay the $370 annual cost of the health care plan for students from families earning less than $66,500.
The university also said it would pay more attention to the rent a family paid in determining its ability to pay for college. Three years ago it said it would not count a family's home equity when it assessed its financial assets.
Graduate students will also receive more generous financial aid. Princeton said it would double the number of doctoral students in the humanities and social science that it supports during the summer, to 650 from 325. Stipends for graduate students and their health care coverage will also be improved.
The university also said it would provide all first-year doctoral students with full tuition and a stipend to help cover living expenses.
The university said it would increase the rate of spending from its endowment to help pay for these programs and others, including providing more money for faculty salaries and a larger budget for teaching foreign languages, and sabbatical leaves for senior lecturers.

Power Struggles

BYLINE:  By Todd S. Purdum

 BODY:
 California continues to struggle with a crisis that seems surreal at its core: the state that is the epicenter of the nation's high tech economy has been repeatedly struck by the failure of a vital piece of its electrical service. State leaders edged toward a first-step solution, negotiating to buy power on long-term contracts at reasonable prices, then pass it on to the state's near-bankrupt utilities. 
The state would float bonds to finance the deal, perhaps in exchange for receiving utility stock that could be sold to repay the cost once the market rebounded. Consumers would also pay through an extension of recent rate increases. But officials warned that a crash program to conserve energy and finish construction of new power plants would still be needed to avoid blackouts at times of peak demand this summer. Todd S. Purdum

THE most lucrative oyster beds in Connecticut are in New Haven Harbor. That is the exact place where the Long Island Power Authority hopes an electrical cable can be buried next year to carry up to 600 megawatts of power 26 miles underneath Long Island Sound to the Island, where the demand for electricity appears to be creeping close to the limits of supply.
 The Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, and two environmental groups, Save the Sound and the Connecticut Maritime Coalition, say the cable could damage an area of the harbor roughly 3 miles long and 5 feet wide and have formally intervened in the application now before the Connecticut Siting Council. It is the first in a string of applications for necessary permits. 
 TransEnergie US Ltd. of Westborough, Mass., an affiliate of Quebec-based TransEnergie, applied last fall to the Connecticut Siting Council for a "certificate of environmental compatibility and public need" to bury the cable six feet deep in the harbor. Later they negotiated with the State Department of Agriculture to bury it four and a half feet deep. 
The nine-member council opened the public hearing last September in New Haven, and continued it over six other days in November, December and January, said Joel Rinebold, executive director of the siting council. Mr. Rinebold said the next hearing was on Monday at the council's headquarters in New Britain.
"They have to prove that the benefits from the facility would outweigh the environmental effects," Mr. Rinebold said.
For LIPA, the cost-benefit calculation is a slam-dunk for the cable, especially since there are no sensitive shellfish beds at the Shoreham end of the cable route.
"We're seeking to get more power to Long Island so we won't have a situation like California," said Bert Cunningham, vice president for communications at LIPA, referring to electric shortages in the deregulated California power industry that led to selective blackouts in that state.
Mr. Cunningham said LIPA predicted in 1998 that consumption would increase by 2 percent a year but that the growth rate has been 3.5 percent.
"The economy really picked up steam over the past couple of years," Mr. Cunningham said. "More people have home computers, fax machines; companies are putting in more computers. We have seen an incredible increase in the consumption of energy."
The LIPA chairman, Richard M. Kessel, said that Long Island came "extremely close to blackouts" during a four-day heat spell in early July.
The proposed cable would add the kind of insurance against brownouts Long Island seeks. Four major tie lines from New York to Long Island, and one underwater cable from Norwalk to Port Jefferson, join with six oil-fired steam plants on Long Island to provide about 5,100 megawatts of electricity to the public. On July 6, 1999, between 3 and 4 p.m., customers gobbled up 4,590 megawatts of electricity.
Mr. Cunningham said the authority had sought the cable because it was responsible for producing power, even though it was pushing a conservation program, and even though deregulation of the industry had produced a slew of proposals for independently owned power plants on the Island. The cable, he said, seems more sure than those other power sources, all of which are subject to Nimby attacks.
The cable is actually a bundle of three: two high-voltage cables and one fiber-optic connection. It would be encased in a protective steel jacket and would not have insulating fluid, which can leak on buried cables. A cable owned by Northeast Utilities, between Norwalk, Conn., and Port Jefferson has leaked its insulating fluid, drawing criticism from environmental groups. TransEnergie plans to install the cable next fall and winter, said James Nash, project director for the cable plan.
The cable would leave the land in New Haven at the East Shore Station of United Illuminating Company, which is now owned by Wisvest Connecticut. (NRG Energy Inc. is negotiating to buy that station.) It would meander south across the Sound and tie in to the power substation built on the grounds of the Shoreham nuclear power plant, which was decommissioned in 1992 before it ever produced electricity.
Mr. Nash said New Haven was an ideal place to install the cable because the company would not have to gain rights of way from landowners. He said the company believed that the sea floor in New Haven Harbor could recover after the cable trench was dug.
TransEnergie has agreed to contribute $1 million toward establishing an oyster seed hatchery elsewhere in Connecticut, and to pay $1 million to restore the shellfish beds in New Haven Harbor.
"We're committed to performing a bed refurbishment of the very narrow passage," Mr. Nash said. He referred to the damage when a hydraulic "jet plow" would stir up the bottom to make a four-foot-wide trench for the cable.
TransEnergie also has negotiated a private agreement with Tallmadge Brothers, Briarpatch and Fairhaven Clam and Lobster, three commercial oyster growers that lease beds in New Haven Harbor. The terms of the agreement have remained secret.
Bruce Gresczyk, deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Agriculture Department, said the state's oyster industry was worth at least $60 million each year and the clam industry several million dollars. The state leases beds in New Haven Harbor to commercial growers. Half of the state's oyster crop begins life there before growers move them to other beds to mature. The clams grow buried in the soft mud and sand of the harbor bottom. New Haven Harbor holds the most intensely cultivated oyster beds on the Connecticut coast, said John Volk, director of the state's Bureau of Aquaculture in Milford, which has spent the last decade and a half trying to boost the state's shellfishing industry.
The Connecticut Department of Agriculture, which oversees the shellfishing industry, negotiated an agreement with TransEnergie that said the department did not want the cable built but that it would not object if other state officials believe it was necessary.
"Our position from day one is that we preferred an overland route but we also recognized that we are neither the permitting authority or the siting authority," Mr. Gresczyk said.
"No. 1, we want to protect the integrity of the resource," Mr. Gresczyk said. "If this thing was going to get sited there we wanted to protect it to the best of our abilities." 
But the state attorney general, Mr. Blumenthal, said the cable would do too much damage to be worth what it accomplished. While Mr. Gresczyk said he was guessing the shellfish beds could be restored in a few years, Mr. Blumental said experts didn't know what such a cable will do to the beds over time.
"The potential environmental impact is huge, profound and lasting, and the unknowns are even more alarming than the known pitfalls," Mr. Blumenthal said. "There has been no real exploration of alternatives. There is no ascertainable benefit to Connecticut since the power at least for the foreseeable future will be flowing from Connecticut to New York."
Mr. Volk of the state aquaculture bureau said that New Haven Harbor was the heart of Connecticut's oyster production. Here, private oyster growers lease beds from the state to nurture the shellfish, which only a few years ago recovered from a disease, MSX.
The state made its concerns clear, Mr. Volk said, because it is not known what effect the dredging operation and cable would have on the environment. For example, Mr. Rinebold said the temperature of the water was expected to go up a 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit on the sea floor directly over the buried cable, and Mr. Volk said MSX had been linked to warmer temperatures.
Save the Sound, an environmental group based in Stamford, became an intervenor in the Siting Council application. The group's president, John Atkin, said the group's board was worried that the cable could continue to do damage after it's installed.
"We're concerned about what happens after it's built," he said. "And we're also concerned about what kind of precedent it might set. If the Siting Council were to allow this cable -- and with electric deregulation we see what's happening in California now -- maybe private companies will be asking for cables all up and down the Sound."

HEADLINE: AOL Time Warner Base Lifts Silicon Alley 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
AOL Time Warner's decision to locate its corporate headquarters in New York seemed to have had little more impact than a few new signs going up in Rockefeller Center. After all, the heart of America Online is still based in Dulles, Va., many executives remain in other parts of the country and few new jobs came to the city.
 But nearly three weeks after Time Warner and America Online completed their merger, making it the world's largest Internet media company, the presence of its headquarters in Time Warner's skyscraper at 75 Rockefeller Plaza has already begun to have at least a psychological impact on Silicon Alley. 
 Around water coolers and at technology industry events and meetings, business leaders say that the symbolic act of choosing New York for the merged entities' headquarters has buoyed a battered Silicon Alley, which has faced thousands of layoffs and the closings of many dot-coms since April. 
"If nothing else, it is a beacon in the climate of the last year," Anna Copeland Wheatley, the editor in chief of AlleyCat News, said of AOL Time Warner's decision to base itself in New York. "A lot of New York accounting firms, law firms and insurance firms target the new-media industry, and to have an 8,000-pound gorilla sitting at the table, it makes it a lot easier."
The creation of Silicon Alley, a cluster of Internet media startups mostly in Lower Manhattan, in the early 1990's "demonstrated that New York was a viable place to create an early stage technology company, and I think there was a lot of doubt about that," said Brian T. Horey, the venture capitalist who founded the New York New Media Association. But when the dot-com boom went bust last year, Silicon Alley seemed to take a harder hit than many other technology regions. Since April, thousands of employees have been laid off, entrepreneurs increasingly complain they cannot find capital and at least 15 Silicon Alley companies are performing so poorly that their stocks are in danger of being removed from the Nasdaq composite listing. 
Randy Schoenfeld, a managing partner at Redwood Partners, Silicon Alley's oldest executive-recruiting and venture capital consulting firm, said that AOL Time Warner provided a needed psychological shot in the arm.
Mr. Schoenfeld said market conditions suggested that layoffs at Silicon Alley companies would continue, but said that at the very least "AOL Time Warner gives us validation that New York is going to be the Internet media capital of the world."
In the January edition of the Silicon Alley Reporter, a trade magazine that featured a photograph on its cover of the Hindenburg crashing, the noticeable bright spot was AOL Time Warner. "Silicon Alley's upper border is now Rockefeller Center," the magazine said in an article on the Silicon Alley top 100. The merger was Silicon Alley's "first significant step toward fulfilling its potential as the center of the new New Economy," the article continued.
Since the merger was completed on Jan. 11, AOL Time Warner has announced 2,000 layoffs, and company officials continue to stress that they are only bringing a relative handful of workers to New York.
Jeff Dachis, the president of Razorfish, an Internet consulting company based on Grand Street, said "the company's presence is being welcomed."
"It's like Seattle," he said. "Everybody knows about Microsoft, and they think you are probably near their campus, and that you probably have some ex-Microsoft executives running your company."
Charles Millard, a former Giuliani administration economic development chief, remembers having to convince people in the mid-1990's that Silicon Alley was not a typographical error. "To the extent that there has ever been doubt about New York's standing as an anchor in the digital world, I think that this is going to put it to rest," he said. "It has been a tough year. Something like this is helpful."
But whether or not AOL Time Warner proves good for the city, or Silicon Alley, not everyone was enthusiastic about its presence. Avner Ronen, president of Odigo, a Lower Manhattan company that has battled AOL over whether all instant-messaging program users should be able to communicate with one another, said: "Maybe now there is a chance of me running into one of AOL's people in the streets. But I find it hard to believe that being closer will make them any nicer. I don't expect them to change the way they act."

HEADLINE: Reagan Was a Reaganite 

BYLINE:  By David Brooks; David Brooks is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard.

 BODY:
 REAGAN, IN HIS
OWN HAND
The Writings of Ronald Reagan
That Reveal His Revolutionary Vision for America.
Edited by Kiron K. Skinner,
Annelise Anderson and Martin Anderson.
Foreword by George P. Shultz.
549 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $30.
 The Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev once wrote, "It would be possible to determine two patterns, two types among men's souls, the one inclined toward the spirit of Tolstoy, the other toward that of Dostoyevsky." And isn't it amazing how that quotation reminds you of today's Republican Party? For among Republicans, too, there are two patterns, two types, the one inclined toward the spirit of Reagan, the other toward that of Bush.
The Reaganites had their formative experiences in secluded corners of college libraries, where they discovered Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, Russell Kirk and Leo Strauss. For them politics is a battle of ideas. Liberal ideas -- like affirmative action and legal abortion -- are in error and must be disproved and replaced. Reaganites tend to work in think tanks, or wish they did. They care about long-ago disputes, like the guilt of Alger Hiss, because they want you to know not only that liberals are wrong now but also that they were always wrong. 
The Bushies, on the other hand, are more normal and more boring. They have neat desks and thin briefcases because their reading comes in the form of memos. They tend to work -- very hard, in fact -- in corporations, law firms and other large organizations, and regard themselves as master managers. They see politics as a competition of interests. They are good at striking deals. 
Reaganites and Bushies are both skeptical of government. The differences are in how they think, not what they think. The Bushies look at the Reaganites and see hapless geeks -- useful if you're in need of a speech, but certainly not the sort to be trusted with real responsibility. The Reaganites see the Bushies as hapless anal retentives. They may be good at playing the bureaucracy, but they don't know where they're going because they have no principles. They don't even know what an idea is. They say things like, "Our foreign policy should be in our national interest," and think they have expressed one. 
Since the Republican Party is a conservative, orderly party, the two camps take turns screwing up. Bushian pragmatists dominated the first Bush administration. They got so caught up in the 1990 budget process that they compromised on what were supposed to be their core principles and lost touch with the American people. So after Bush's defeat, the ideologues, led by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, took control of the party. But they were harsh, radical and uncompromising, so now Republicans are once again dominated by Bushianism. In selecting his cabinet, George W. Bush generally passed over provocative thinkers and people who give good interviews in favor of sober executives. This is an administration so corporate that the lone academic at the top level -- the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice -- sat on the board of Chevron and has an oil tanker named after her.
In the midst of this Bushian risorgimento comes a book to remind us of the differences between the two mental types. The book is called "Reagan, in His Own Hand," and it is mostly a collection of radio commentaries Ronald Reagan delivered between 1976 and 1980, between his failed primary challenge to Gerald Ford and his successful campaign against Jimmy Carter. During those years, Reagan returned to the rubber-chicken circuit, wrote a column and delivered these daily radio messages. Ghostwriters wrote the column, but Reagan actually worked on the radio commentaries himself. He'd sit on airplanes and in the back of cars, drafting piece after piece on legal pads, and would come back from a trip with three weeks of commentaries ready for typing. The dominant impression these drafts leave is that Reagan really was a Reaganite. He'd already been governor of California, but he still saw politics primarily as a battle of ideas. 
These are earnest policy sermons. Reagan covered everything from bilingual education to the Panama Canal to the political situation in Equatorial Guinea, engrossing himself in a level of detail that frankly surpasses that of almost all op-ed columnists today. In 1978, for example, he came across a speech the Yale law professor Eugene Rostow gave on the proposed SALT II arms control agreement. Reagan couldn't do just one radio commentary summarizing and commenting on Rostow's views. He did six, going through the arcana about mobile launchers, MIRV's, Minutemen versus MX missiles and so on.
Reagan was a middlebrow (and I mean that as a compliment). He believed in the serious explication of ideas. He'd troll through clippings from The Public Interest or National Review, or a policy document someone had sent him, and he'd want to bring it to his listeners' attention. Sometimes, caught up in didactic fervor, he'd get carried away. During a commentary on how tax indexing works, he declared: "A family of four earning $9,600 last year will have to get a $595 raise to keep even with the 6.2 percent inflation rate. So this year their income is $10,195. But that raise put them in a higher state tax bracket reducing their purchasing power by $70." Reagan must have understood that cramming all those numbers into three sentences makes for terrible radio. But he was eager to get the concept across. 
Unlike radio commentators or newspaper pundits today, he never responded to the news blip of the moment. He generally ignored political scandals; anyone looking for personal attacks on Jimmy Carter will come up empty. During a commentary on the capital gains tax rate, Reagan declared, "Frankly speaking the president was a little off base." That was as rough as he got.
The editors of this volume, Kiron K. Skinner, Annelise Anderson and Martin Anderson, have toted up the commentaries by subject matter. Twenty-seven percent of them were on foreign and defense policy, 25 percent were on economic policy, 15 percent were on regulation and individual liberty, 10 percent were on energy and the environment, and the like. As the editors note with some surprise, only 3 percent were on social issues, and only one commentary was on abortion. Judging from these pieces, Reagan was more of a policy wonk than a culture warrior. His abortion commentary is entirely secular. He says that until he was governor he'd never given the subject much thought. He declared that neither medicine nor law nor theology rendered a clear verdict. So he asked his lawyers if fetuses had property rights. If a pregnant woman became a widow and found that her husband had split his estate between her and the unborn child, Reagan wondered, could she abort the child and inherit all of the estate? On the basis of such questioning, Reagan decided that since fetuses had property rights, they must have rights to life. 
One of the things these commentaries do is blow apart the notion that Reagan was a flighty actor who floated through the presidency on the basis of charm and communication skills. Reagan spent the years leading up to his presidency -- the decades, really -- involved in day-to-day policy disputes. Another thought one can't escape is that George W. Bush could never have written these commentaries. It is impossible to imagine George W. sitting down and composing little essays on the inefficiency of Amtrak subsidies or the foolishness of the Law of the Sea treaty, as Reagan did. 
But that doesn't mean that Bush is stupider than Reagan, just that the Bush mind is of a different cast. Reagan must have been happiest reading National Review essays on cold war disputes. Bush is clearly happiest reading people. If anything, the Bush mentality is the more conservative, if by conservative you mean prudent, managerial and incremental.
IN fact, the great promise of the Bush administration -- and the early days of any administration are the season to dream -- is that he will finally reconcile the two mentalities. He is staffing his administration with people like Tommy Thompson and Donald Rumsfeld. Thompson is a legislative tactician, but he also pursued the long-range vision of welfare reform. Rumsfeld, an administrator and businessman, has latched on to missile defense. And in one respect Bush already does resemble a Reaganite. Once he gets a policy notion in his head, he sticks with it. Unlike most pragmatists, he doesn't overreact to the daily flow of events. If anything, he underreacts.
So maybe the two sides of the Republican brain can finally be brought into harmony. If that happens, the epic novel to describe the second Bush administration won't be "War and Peace" or "Crime and Punishment." It will be a love story called "Geeks and Golfers." But if it's longer than 200 pages, the Bushies won't read it.

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE; 
Changing TheWorld, From Top To Bottom

BYLINE:  By FRED ANDREWS 

 BODY:
IN their economic thinking, President Bush and Jeffrey E. Garten have much in common, an overlap that makes Mr. Garten's new book all the more timely.
 Both the president and Mr. Garten are firm believers in the private sector and free trade. But in "The Mind of the C.E.O." (Basic Books, $26) Mr. Garten has sketched a role for business leadership that goes far beyond what Republicans and business itself have traditionally accepted. 
 In this provocative but ultimately frustrating book, Mr. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, asserts that big business must aggressively help to overhaul the world marketplace and apply its mind to global poverty and other plights. 
For some readers, Mr. Garten's vision will seem impractical and overreaching. For others, it will be a fair test of willingness by the Bush administration and its business allies to exercise creative leadership on the global scene.
Mr. Garten served President Clinton as undersecretary of commerce for international trade. Once an investment banker, he has high esteem for the chieftains of global business -- in his estimation, the elite of the corporate elite. 
"These are people who best understand the effects of change, technology, globalization," the dean writes. "They are the ones who know what it means to set concrete goals and meet them." 
He asks for a new way of thinking about business and society that recognizes the multinational corporation as a pivotal participant in society and politics.
His book was inspired by watching Jack Welch of General Electric, a spellbinder without equal, enchant an audience of Yale management students. A big conglomerate is like a big house, Mr. Welch counseled, each floor a layer of management, each wall separating one division from another. Toss in a grenade, the grandmaster urged, and obliterate all those barriers. 
Charmed by that wisdom, Mr. Garten took to the road to pick the brains of the most farsighted chief executives he could find. 
He compiled a list of 40, mostly but not exclusively chief executives. Almost all run (or advise or finance) huge multinational enterprises. Three lost their jobs before the book was published.
The impressive selection sparkles with innovative figures from the new global economy, pathfinders like Stephen M. Case of AOL Time Warner, Frederick W. Smith of FedEx, Jorma Ollila of Nokia, Richard Branson of Virgin and Stan Shih of Acer in Taiwan. 
Not that the old establishment was treated with disrespect. The Fab 40 also include Sir John Browne of BP Amoco, Dr. Rolf-Ernst Breuer of Deutsche Bank, Benson Ford of Ford Motor, Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express and Hiroshi Okuda of Toyota, plus James D. Wolfensohn of the World Bank and Susan V. Berresford of the Ford Foundation.
More precisely, the book is "The Mind of the C.E.O. Inside the Mind of Jeffrey E. Garten." He sets out to discover not only what chief executives think, but also what he thinks of what they think. 
Mr. Garten has a keen mind and a confident sense of global economic reality, and his detached assessments save the book from simply serving up the lofty words that eminent people often offer when placed on a pedestal and invited to opine. 
HE championed free trade in the first Clinton administration and now promotes a far more robust role for big business than either the Bush administration or big business itself shows any eagerness to embrace. He urges multinational leadership to take the lead in laying new foundations for the global marketplace, adding what he considers a much-needed layer of regulation and enforcement. Even more ambitiously, he wants big business to provide the leadership in global problem-solving on poverty, income extremes, dismal health services, epidemics, education inequality and other issues. 
A monthly columnist at Business Week, Mr. Garten writes cleanly and clearly. He sees the global economy as vastly promising but dangerously underregulated, lacking rules that mature national economies take for granted. And more broadly, he asks, how can global companies expect to prosper amid appalling poverty and angry nationalism?
He describes capitalism today as "less regulated and more ruthless" than it was four or five decades ago. The financier George Soros tells him that "the market" is wrongly seen as a pendulum, righting itself when swung to an extreme. In fact, Mr. Soros says, the financial markets have become a wrecking ball, knocking over one economy after another.
On reflection, Mr. Garten has concluded that trade policy in the Clinton era amounted to America throwing its weight around, eager not to level the playing field but to give it a good tilt in our direction. "I was definitely one of the culprits," he allows. Though trading partners are still sore from American bullying, all eyes remain on the United States as the great hope. 
Not a harsh word enters this book. Business school deans do not prosper by giving affront to corporate patrons. An admiring interviewer but hardly one with hat in hand, the dean found his hosts "uniformly thoughtful -- even philosophical," but also pragmatic and nonideological, not to mention down to earth and approachable. 
"They can be a progressive force in building capitalism around the world, or they can constitute a rear-guard action," he said. "However they behave, their influence will be at least as important as that of national governments and international organizations -- probably more so." 
For starters, Mr. Garten argues, elite multinational corporations must be less shy in backing the president when he fights their battles (as President Clinton did, unsuccessfully, on legislation to expedite Congressional approval of trade agreements). 
Mr. Garten sees opportunities as specific as helping to establish more business schools abroad and dispatching teams of accountants and regulatory experts to help design economies for tomorrow. 
And he marvels at the burdens carried by chief executives. Deluged by data, swimming in uncertainty, his immortals routinely place bold, multibillion-dollar bets with a fragment of the information they need. They survive by finding "simplicities that work -- following basic instincts, identifying first principles clearly and remaining true to them in good times and bad." Orit Gadiesh of Bain & Company calls that "finding true north" -- the character, consistency and principle that hold an organization together.
THIS is not to say that Mr. Garten is a patsy. Two-thirds of the way through the book, it becomes clear that he is gravely doubtful that the corporate elite will rise to his challenge. As coolly as a scholar discoursing over a favorite merlot, he lays out exactly why he expects to be disappointed. Ultimately, the dean is profoundly critical of the chief executives, but his book does not so much hold their feet to the fire as it warms their tootsies. 
His chief executives would rather fly coach to Australia than pick up the gauntlet. Though they have to maintain a certain stance, the last thing they want is still another responsibility on an alien playing field. They dread being caught in the trench warfare of politics. 
In tough times, statesmanship becomes an indulgence. "Unless you are competitive, then all other issues are moot," says C. Michael Armstrong of AT&T.
So a gulf persists between talking the talk and walking the walk. Mr. Garten is fully aware that many critics speak in much harsher terms than he does. "The upshot," he says, "is that C.E.O.'s need to get in front of movements they see coming, rather than always fighting a rear-guard action."
He concedes that many people already believe that big business has bought and paid for too much sway in Washington. Much of the world has experienced big business mainly as an oppressor. Under enlightened leadership, multinational corporations have nevertheless committed high crimes and misdemeanors. Acknowledging all that, Mr. Garten warns them that active or passive, they are targets of the growing backlash against corporate globalism. 
In a chapter called "Reflections," he concludes that history will judge today's renowned chief executives lukewarmly, as competent but overwhelmed, smothered by pressures "much greater than anything these individuals could handle well." It is disappointing that the dean's self-rebuttal is more persuasive than his visionary agenda.

The General Picks Up Where He Left Off

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN L. POWELL is beginning his days in office with the same problem he left behind eight years ago: Saddam Hussein. But now, instead of reeling from the general's war during the first Bush administration, Mr. Hussein seems more and more in the driver's seat. He's been cockily inviting all and sundry to fly into his newly refurbished Baghdad airport, sending emissaries abroad, emboldening Palestinians by moving troops around, and soaking up hard currency from smuggled oil as sanctions lose nearly all international support.
 For the new Bush team, Mr. Hussein's burst out of isolation is a serious -- and embarrassing -- crisis in the making. Increasingly, the situation looks less like a standoff with Mr. Hussein and more as if Mr. Hussein has attained the upper hand. Already Iraq is forcing the Bush administration to step back from campaign statements about getting tougher with Mr. Hussein, and even of taking him on. Instead, General Powell is proposing what amounts to a realist's narrowing of American goals and a recognition that maintaining full sanctions and restoring United Nations arms inspections are lost causes. 
 The new strategy General Powell is devising would focus on enforcing narrower sanctions rather than on seeking a military overthrow. (There is a historical parallel in this: In the months leading up to the fighting in the gulf in 1991, the general was the most eager of the national security team to keep sanctions as the main pressure on Mr. Hussein, and one of the most reluctant to go to war to push Iraq's troops out of Kuwait.) 
The new administration has little choice but to revise Iraqi policy, which remained virtually dormant in the last two years of the Clinton administration, once United Nations inspectors were forced to withdraw in 1998. Even Britain, Washington's closest ally on Iraq, is now conducting a review of its policy. In part, British officials have grown weary of the burden on its military of the bombing flights it shares with the United States to enforce the no-fly zone in southern Iraq. Also, the British can see the stampede at the United Nations, where three of the five permanent Security Council members -- France, Russia and China -- as well as many Arab and Asian countries are pressing to eliminate sanctions so they can resume full business ties with Iraq. 
Judging by his Senate confirmation hearing, General Powell has the contours of his approach worked out: Go to the old coalition partners in the Gulf and persuade them that they -- not the United States -- are most threatened by Mr. Hussein's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction. So they should agree, the general argues, to enforce sanctions -- but in a narrower but tighter form, this time focusing on military equipment and dual use items that Mr. Hussein can use for weapons production. That new formula would allow General Powell to loosen up the flow of consumer goods so that the Iraqi people emerge from being the chief victims of the West's sanctions. But General Powell still wants the United Nations to keep tight control of the money, now in an escrow account, that Mr. Hussein receives from his oil exports. 
Stressing the strong personal ties that he has among leaders in the gulf countries, General Powell offered the senators a preview of the argument he will carry to the gulf's leaders: "You'd better see it as you that is at the other end of these missiles."
IMPLICIT, though not yet firmly stated, in General Powell's arguments is that he will visit the major Arab countries, most likely Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and cash in some of the personal chits he earned during the gulf war. The 10th anniversary of victory in the gulf is next month and the Kuwaitis have asked everyone, especially General Powell, to come. But his task may not be as easy as he might want. These leaders remain frightened by the anti-American sentiments their people are expressing based on the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Also implicit in General Powell's strategy is giving up on the hope that United Nations inspectors will get back into Iraq. How the administration would finesse this loss of face remains to be seen. And how the embargo on military and dual use items would be enforced is not quite clear either.
"United Nations inspectors should not be the focus of American policy because it is unlikely to happen and because by focusing on that we would lose the chance to modernize the sanctions regime," said Meghan O'Sullivan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in sanctions policy. One obvious way to check imports of military material is to mandate inspections of the increasing number of flights that are going into Baghdad, Ms. O'Sullivan said. Another possibility under study is to post inspectors at key border points.
A hard-line wing of the Bush administration has been pushing to get more money and weapons to the Iraqi opposition in exile. For now, at least, this does not seem the preferred option. Paul D. Wolfowitz, who is slated to become deputy secretary of defense, and others say the Clinton administration was half-hearted in its support of the Iraqi opposition and favor beefing it up now. But General Powell, during his hearings, said with a skeptical tone that a requirement for such a plan is a "sound basis for believing that people could be successful once they go onto Iraqi territory."
Some experts see the Powell approach as minimalist but achievable. "All Bush can do at this point is to maintain consensus on blocking the sale of war materiel to Iraq," Graham E. Fuller, a former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council at the Central Intelligence Agency, said recently. "The bad news is that it is probably too late for the new administration to effect genuine change in Iraq at a price the United States is willing to pay." 
Despite facing Mr. Hussein again, the general is still anxious to justify the decision he helped make at the end of the gulf war to leave the Iraqi leader in place. "Mr. Saddam Hussein can put a hat on his head and shoot a rifle in the air at an Army Day parade," General Powell told the senators, "but it is fundamentally a broken, weak country -- one-third the military force it had some 10 years ago. We really did what we said we were going to do with Desert Storm -- bring them down to size."
But that was then. The question for today is whether even a shrunken Iraqi threat is too much to tolerate with any degree of comfort.

Et Tu, Alan?

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Despite his legendary obscurity, what Alan Greenspan has to say is usually quite clear and intellectually coherent once translated into English. But his testimony last Thursday before the Senate Budget Committee was evasive and often inconsistent. It was hard to avoid the impression that Mr. Greenspan's intent was to give aid and comfort to the new administration, while retaining plausible deniability.
 True, Mr. Greenspan explicitly rejected the administration's argument that we must immediately cut taxes to prevent a recession. While conceding that the economy may grow little if at all this quarter, he suggested that a recovery would probably be under way before tax cuts could have any impact. By the way, new evidence suggests that manufacturing, which suffered a nasty downturn in the last few months, has already started to rebound. 
 Nonetheless, the headlines were all about Mr. Greenspan's endorsement of tax cuts -- something the Fed chairman must have known would happen. And when you look at the tortured logic by which Mr. Greenspan arrived at that endorsement, you have to wonder whether those headlines weren't exactly what he wanted. 
His argument went as follows: given its projected surpluses over the next decade, the federal government may not only pay off its debt, but actually find itself using surplus cash to buy private assets. This could cause problems, he suggested, because it would be "difficult to insulate the government's investment decisions from political pressures." So we should engage in "pre-emptive smoothing of the glide path," which turns out to mean cutting taxes enough so that the federal government never does pay off its debt, after all.
Now I would quarrel with those surplus projections. I would also point out that in declaring "it is far better . . . that the surpluses be lowered by tax reductions than by spending increases," Mr. Greenspan was out of bounds. Since when is it the Fed's business to say that we should have a tax cut rather than, say, a new prescription drug benefit -- or for that matter a missile defense system? (Neither program is factored into those surplus projections.) Mr. Greenspan himself seemed aware that he was on shaky ground, offering the very inadequate excuse that "I speak for myself and not necessarily for the Federal Reserve." 
But the really strange thing about his argument was that he seemed to ignore the fact that the main reason the federal government will one day become an investor is the buildup of assets in the hands of the Social Security and Medicare systems -- and those funds must accumulate assets to prepare for the future demands of the baby-boom generation. Indeed, by all estimates even the huge projected surpluses of those trust funds will be inadequate to the task. "Certainly," Mr. Greenspan declared, "we should make sure that Social Security surpluses are large enough to meet our long-term needs." Well, I'm sorry, but you can't do that without allowing the federal government to become an investor.
So if that prospect was what was really worrying Mr. Greenspan, he should have focused on the problem of how to prevent the government's position as an investor from being abused. And there are many ways to do that -- including, by the way, realistic plans for partial privatization of Social Security, which (unlike the fantasy promises of the Bush campaign) would require the federal government to ante up trillions of dollars to pay off existing obligations, solving the "problem" of excessive surpluses quite easily.
But Mr. Greenspan seemed determined to arrive at tax cuts as an answer. After dismissing the argument that we need a tax cut to fend off a recession now, and conceding that tax cuts have historically "proved difficult to implement in the time frame in which recessions have developed and ended," he waffled: "Should current economic weakness spread beyond what now seems likely, having a tax cut in place may, in fact, do noticeable good." But by the same token, if the economy is strong again by the time a tax cut goes into effect, won't that tax cut do noticeable harm? Mr. Greenspan declined to answer questions along those lines.
When a man who is usually a clear thinker ties himself in intellectual knots in order to find a way to say exactly what the new president wants to hear, it's not hard to guess what's going on. But it's not a pretty sight.

HEADLINE: Nation Awash in Ideas For Changing Voting 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Next week, an art design course will be offered at the University of Massachusetts in which students will study the infamous "butterfly ballot" that confused voters in Palm Beach, Fla. In California, a hastily organized trade show of voting-machine manufacturers proved so popular that the state is planning a second. And here in Washington, state elections officials will gather next week to recommend changes in voting.
 "There's an enormous amount of activity out there," said Kimball Brace, an elections expert with Election Data Services, a Washington company that specializes in election administration and redistricting. 
 "Nobody wants to be the next Palm Beach," Mr. Brace said.
As a result of the disputed presidential election and its messy aftermath in Florida, the nation -- Congress, local governments, industry and academia -- seems awash in proposals to change election laws. Even President Bush gave change a nod last week, albeit privately to leaders of Congress, which will consider the first serious overhaul of federal voting procedures in decades.
Ideas include changing Election Day to a weekend or making it a federal holiday, closing polls at the same time across the country, allowing voter registration on Election Day and requiring that machines give voters receipts.
Constitutional amendments have been proposed to apportion electoral votes based on the popular vote in Congressional districts and to abolish the Electoral College. 
Bills would provide millions of dollars to local governments to upgrade their voting equipment. Companies are suddenly in fierce competition to produce modern voting systems, not normally a lucrative field but now potentially a multibillion-dollar market. The projected cost of installing new equipment -- four electronic machines, each costing $5,000, in each of the nation's 191,000 voting precincts -- is nearly $4 billion.
With interest in changes so high, the money potentially available is ballooning. One of the leading Senate bills, co-sponsored by Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, started by proposing $250 million in matching grants to local governments for one year. The proposal has evolved to at least $250 million in matching grants every year for five years -- to $1.25 billion -- and could spiral even higher.
The potential market leaves manufacturers wide-eyed. In California, the secretary of state's office, which oversees elections, recently co-sponsored a trade show, "Election Technology Expo 2001," in Sacramento. Organized in just two weeks, the show drew 40 voting equipment companies and 400 election officials from 14 states.
Microsoft, Unisys and the Dell Computer Corporation are uniting to produce and market new election systems that cover the gamut of election processes, from voter registration to reporting results.
Although the voting machine business in the United States has been slack, several companies made advances as they upgraded equipment for other countries. Unisys, for example, installed electronic systems in Brazil, Italy and Costa Rica that featured touch-pad voting and instant reporting of results.
Accenture, formerly Andersen Consulting, which helped organize the 1999 elections in South Africa, with computers and satellites, will demonstrate its wares on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.
Other major corporations, including I.B.M., Compaq, Cisco Systems and Diebold Inc., are considering entering the field.
"We've pushed a lot of countries around the world to have democracy and open elections, and when we can't conduct an election efficiently and accurately ourselves, it chides us, it's humbling," Senator Brownback said.
Only 9 percent of Americans vote with electronic equipment. New voting systems must be certified because of concern about glitches as they move from the laboratory to the real world.
"The equipment is out there, and it works great -- if there are no voters and no candidates," said Thomas Palfrey, a professor of political science and economics at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech is teaming up with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to evaluate technology and propose solutions.
Surely the butterfly ballot is headed for the dustbin, as graphic designers study it as a model of how not to impart information.
"This was design run amok," said Copper Giloth, an associate art professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who, with Ana-Maria Campos, is using the confusing ballot to help teach Art 297h.
Last week, even President Bush indicated his assent to looking at the system.
"He's open to ideas," said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's press secretary. 
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, announced that the House would appoint a special committee to examine voting proposals. He said he expected the committee to make recommendations in six to eight months.
Even as many focus on high-technology solutions, elections experts caution that these are not necessarily the best way to avoid the problems that became evident last year. They say that less glamorous responses, such as training election workers and refining election law, are essential.
"Everyone who is focused on this -- everyone except elections administrators -- is looking for simple solutions," said Doug Lewis, executive director of The Elections Center, a nonpartisan group in Houston that seeks to improve elections.
"While technology is important, it really is tangential to what happened last year," he said. "In Florida, you had a lack of definition as to what constitutes a vote and no appropriate recount procedure. If you fix those two problems in law or administrative rulings, you solve 90 percent of the issues."
Overhauling the system will take time, and it is not clear whether a new system can be in place by the 2002 elections for Congress.
"It is very complex," Mr. Brace, of Election Data Services, said. "We have to train poll workers, and we have to train the voters. If they were confused with the punch card, wait till they get into this new stuff."

HEADLINE: Forum in Switzerland Focuses on U.S. Economic Slowdown 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
The slowdown in the American economy will cut the global growth rate but will probably not drag the world into recession, a top International Monetary Fund official told world business and political leaders at an annual economic forum here today. 
 The I.M.F.'s deputy director, Stanley Fischer, said the slowdown was causing the fund to predict that growth in the global economy would be considerably lower, "possibly in the range of 3.5 percent." That was scaled back from its prediction of 4.2 percent in September. 
 But, he said, "we are a long way from a global recession."
Mr. Fischer praised the decision by the American Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and said the prospects of further cuts would help speed the United States through its decline. The Bush administration's plans for a tax cut, he added, could help as well if Congress passes it quickly; otherwise the impact will be more over the long term. 
He warned that the slowdown in the United States could have a particularly bad effect on Japan's efforts to pull itself out of a decade of economic trouble, as it might slice into demand for Japanese electronic products. 
But the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, took a strong stand against such pessimism and assured the gathering that his country's economic rebound was nearly complete.
"A path has already been solidly laid," he said, adding that it "will lead the Japanese economy to a full recovery."
As the discussions took place, the protests that have been a constant at world finance meetings in recent years returned. Police officers turned water cannons on about 150 chanting and singing demonstrators when they refused to disperse about half a mile away. "Money, power, profit destroys our world," read one protest banner. 
The demonstrations here were smaller than expected, in part because about 600 protesters were prevented from reaching Davos, and instead clashed with the police in Landquart, 25 miles away. The police there said they had fired tear gas and rubber pellets after some of the demonstrators attacked security personnel with sticks. 
Also at the forum today, Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder, pledged $100 million to a private foundation seeking vaccines against H.I.V. The donation to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative was made via his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Bush Wins Good Reviews For First Week in Office
Prominent Republicans and many Democrats agree that President Bush has presided over one of the most orderly White House transitions in at least 20 years. Analysts say Mr. Bush carefully calibrated his legislative approach by introducing his education package in a way that made it palatable to many Democrats, even as he reassured conservatives by moving to prohibit federal aid to groups that counsel on abortion overseas. 1

President Bush, in his first weekly radio address, signaled anew that he might be willing to budge on the most contentious dimension of his education plan: school vouchers. 14

HEADLINE: BUSH'S TRANSITION LARGELY A SUCCESS, ALL SIDES SUGGEST 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
As President Bush completes his first week in office, prominent Republicans and even many Democrats agree that he has presided over one of the most orderly and politically nimble White House transitions in at least 20 years.
 If the first days offer any clue, they say, Mr. Bush may avoid the kind of stumbles that disrupted the early days of past presidents and hobbled them as they tried to turn their campaign promises into action. 
 Independent academics and analysts as well as politicians in both parties said Mr. Bush had carefully calibrated his legislative offering this week by introducing his education package in a way that made it palatable to many Democrats, even as he reassured conservatives by moving to prohibit federal aid to groups that counsel on abortion overseas. 
They said that Mr. Bush displayed a deft touch in stroking lawmakers, and that his aides have been surprisingly responsive to members of Congress at a time when previous administrations would still be skirmishing over office space.
And next week, Mr. Bush will lay out a carefully planned agenda to help the neediest Americans through religious organizations. He also plans to unveil part of his prescription drug program.
"We were all raised by mothers who told us we had one chance to make a first impression," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, echoing many of his colleagues. "The first few days are certainly encouraging. And a first impression can last you awhile." 
In an unexpected turn that was not of Mr. Bush's making, the new president was helped immensely on Thursday when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, validated the thrust of his economic program in Congressional testimony.
"Talk about a windfall, he got a gigantic break with Greenspan's testimony," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat. "Why God is so good to Republicans is beyond me."
Mr. Bush's success is partly the result of his aides' intensely examining previous transitions, scouring the historical record for gestures and timetables -- and even interviewing important players from past administrations.
For all the respectful reviews, the new administration is barely in its infancy and its political execution has not been flawless. Mr. Bush's selection of former Senator John Ashcroft as attorney general enraged Democrats and many interest groups, who criticized Mr. Ashcroft as too conservative. Though Mr. Ashcroft is expected to be confirmed, even many Republicans questioned why Mr. Bush picked a fight with Democrats still smarting from his excruciatingly close victory.
"There are missteps that will haunt him," said Richard B. Shenkman, a presidential historian. "He campaigned as a uniter, not a divider, then he goes ahead with the Ashcroft nomination."
And while Mr. Bush's move on his first full day in office to deny aid to overseas groups that provide abortion counseling was celebrated by conservatives, it distracted from his theme of the week, education. (One White House official said the move was deliberate, because if Mr. Bush had not acted "there would have been a rising chorus from the right.")
Another reality, if no surprise, is that Mr. Bush has not tackled many of the most nettlesome issues. And with one ill-considered remark or misstep, the successful efforts by the president thus far could unravel.
But when Mr. Bush did run into trouble by selecting Linda Chavez as labor secretary, he moved quickly to accept her withdrawal and selected Elaine L. Chao, who is likely to be confirmed by the Senate next week.
Despite his misgivings, Mr. Shenkman said that over all this transition has been the smoothest since Ronald Reagan arrived here two decades ago. "Hats off to George W.," he said.
White House officials said they began painstaking preparations for the first two weeks of the new presidency immediately after New Year's and had a day-by-day plan in place by Jan. 8.
In a demonstration of the importance Mr. Bush's aides placed on his debut, Karl Rove, the president's senior adviser, said that in December, the staff drafted detailed briefing books on the beginning of every administration since John F. Kennedy's. The books included such facts as how many members of Congress each president met with his first week in office, what time the president and his staff reported to work, when he took his first domestic and foreign trips and when he announced legislative initiatives.
"It's important to strike the right starting note," Mr. Rove said. "Time is precious."
White House officials said they were most impressed by Mr. Reagan's transition, and they met with several officials from that White House, including Edwin Meese III, who was the attorney general; Michael K. Deaver, Mr. Reagan's image adviser; and Richard Wirthlin, a pollster and strategist.
While some experts said Mr. Bush had faced an even more difficult challenge than his predecessors because the five-week post-election stalemate limited the time he had to prepare -- a point the new administration has made time and again -- many others asserted that Mr. Bush actually benefited from the truncated timetable.
That is because with the focus in the press on the electoral dispute, Mr. Bush and his advisers could work quietly behind the scenes assembling a staff. They were spared the fate of Bill Clinton and other incoming presidents who for months found that their deliberations were subjected to speculative, and often damaging, coverage.
"In a weird way, the transition following one of the most turbulent and contested elections in history just didn't draw the same level of media glare as either the Bush transition or the Reagan transition," said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist who is close to the White House, referring to two of the president's predecessors. "And that worked to the Bush team's benefit."
White House officials said they were determined to move swiftly and boasted that they tied the record of President Franklin D. Roosevelt of having six cabinet appointees confirmed and sworn in on the first day.
Officials also said that Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, directed the staff to focus on the smaller touches, like the importance of senior staff members' returning one another's telephone calls as well as calls from members of Congress. They said he also set an example by incessantly writing thank-you cards to people with whom he met with the first week.
This attention to detail impressed some lawmakers in this city of egos, who said they were pleased to get their calls returned by Mr. Card and other top officials who barely knew their new telephone numbers. "A quick response on calls may not seem like a lot," Senator Dodd said, "but it is."
Mr. Bush also placed significant emphasis on meeting with members of Congress.
"I guess the biggest, most pleasant surprise, if you'd call it that, was how receptive members of Congress are to come here to the White House to talk about how we can work together," Mr. Bush said on Friday. "I think we've met with 90 members of Congress here in the first week." About a third of them were Democrats.
White House officials and advisers said Mr. Bush would lay out proposals next week for helping the needy. On Monday, they said, he will announce the opening of an administration office to promote the further integration of faith-based organizations into federally financed social services.
Officials are also likely to announce a national advisory board on the subject. Stephen Goldsmith, the former mayor of Indianapolis who was the Bush campaign's chief domestic policy adviser, will have a leading role in this broad effort, they said.
As the week progresses, the officials said, Mr. Bush will meet at the White House with a variety of religious leaders and heads of not-for-profit charities. He is also expected to unveil proposals including changes in tax deductions that encourage people to give more money to religious and not-for-profit organizations.
Aides said that Mr. Bush would also propose a part of his prescription drug program that deals with an immediate mechanism to get prescription drugs to poor Americans in the interim before there are changes in Medicare to make them available to everyone.
By contrast, Mr. Clinton's transition eight years ago was especially sloppy. In his first days, he found himself mired in a firestorm over gays in the military, an issue that plagued his first term. He was also distracted by severe difficulties in settling on appointees, like an attorney general.
A top aide to Mr. Clinton said of the new president: "It's hard walking into the place on Day 1 and pulling it off. They did a lot better than we did. It's pretty impressive."
Four years before Mr. Clinton took office, President George Bush acknowledged at the end of his first week that there had been "ripples" of trouble. He was less aggressive than his son has been in pressing forward on an agenda. And there were flare-ups over how his administration planned to handle the savings and loan debacle, and over the abortion views of Mr. Bush's choice to run the department of health and human services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan.
John H. Sununu, who was then the White House chief of staff, said at the time, "Probably the most important thing we did not do well was that we could have had more discipline in the packaging of the message."
In 1980, Ronald Reagan won plaudits for a relatively peaceful transition, but even he found himself under attack in the first week from conservatives who objected to his selection of appointees whom they did not deem sufficiently conservative, like Donald T. Regan as secretary of the treasury and Samuel R. Pierce Jr. as housing secretary.
But in Mr. Reagan's first days, there was nothing like the turmoil of Jimmy Carter's debut, when there were huge public fights between the campaign staff and a separate operation designed to run the transition.
"Most White Houses are lucky if they get the furniture in," said Patrick H. Caddell, who was Mr. Carter's pollster. Referring to the Carter transition, he said: "There was disarray. We were still learning. And Clinton blew it all in the first week. He drove his numbers to the ground in the immediate transition. George Bush and his people seem to know everybody. They all look like they've been in the same club before. So he's got momentum going for him."
Most of all, politicians gave credit to Mr. Bush for surrounding himself with advisers and aides who have vast Washington experience, beginning with the vice president, Dick Cheney, who was chief of staff for former President Gerald R. Ford, a member of the House and, later, a secretary of defense. Mr. Card was a deputy chief of staff for Mr. Bush's father.
"President Bush has put together a pretty seasoned team around him -- if you add their years in Washington, you get a century's worth of experience," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat. "So his first few days in office have been largely free from controversy."
Although Mr. Bush has benefited from seasoned Washington hands, White House aides said that the officials who had the largest role in stage-managing the agenda for his first days were two of the president's confidants from Texas: Mr. Rove, who developed the central strategy, and Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's counselor, who was responsible for message development.
Robert M. Teeter, who ran the elder President Bush's transition, also praised the new president for skillfully playing on low expectations for his debut.
"If you go out and make a lot of overblown assertions about what you're going to do," Mr. Teeter said, "you're just setting yourself up."

HEADLINE: Experts Try to Make Missile Shield Plan Palatable to China 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
With President Bush dead set on building a national missile defense, American and Chinese military experts have begun exploring ways to make such a shield more palatable to China and say a compromise, though extremely difficult, might be possible. 
 American plans for a missile shield have stirred opposition in capitals across the globe, but China's resistance may be the most intractable. If the Bush administration does push ahead with its plans -- and it has given every sign that it will -- China's objections loom as a stiff foreign policy challenge. 
 A way out of the impasse might be found, military experts say, but it will require near-heretical political steps by leaders in Washington and Beijing. Without some accommodation, experts and Chinese officials warn, the American shield could poison relations, set off a dangerous arms race across Asia and even raise the chances of a war. 
Up to now, American officials have said the proposed defenses are intended to counter only smaller powers like Iran and North Korea while offering little more than assurances that a missile shield is not aimed at stifling China. 
But Chinese leaders are acutely aware that any working system may effectively neutralize their bantam nuclear forces and fear it will subject them to potential American bullying, particularly regarding Taiwan. They have uttered shrill denunciations of the American plan and refused to discuss their own plans to expand their nuclear arsenal. 
Now, experts from both countries say, as it has become clear that a new American administration is determined to press ahead with a missile shield, new thinking is required. 
"If the American intention is to use this system to defend against China, then I can't see any room for compromise," said Li Bin, a nuclear physicist and arms control expert at Qinghua University who advises the government. "But if they really are just worried about the so-called rogue states, and they aren't trying to undermine China's deterrent," he said, "then it may be possible in principle to reach agreement." 
An unofficial group of private American military experts visited Beijing recently to discuss the issue with Chinese officials and scholars. 
The Chinese officials listened to proposals for compromise, according to some who attended, but did not endorse them and mainly restated Beijing's opposition to the American plan, while the interest of scholars outside the government was more obviously piqued. But the fact that Chinese authorities attended and allowed such meetings to take place at all indicated their strong desire to find a way for their concerns to be taken into account. 
"We wanted to help the Chinese understand more clearly that the missile-defense train has already left the station," said Bates Gill, an arms expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington who was part of the visiting American group. "They can try to engage in a serious dialogue with the United States, or they can keep their heads in the sand as important decisions get made."
Military experts on both sides of the Pacific say the ideas they discussed would require the American president to place clear limits on the size of the shield and -- risking sharp divisions in the Republican Party and Congress -- to acknowledge China's stature as a nuclear power. The Americans would have to agree, implicitly at least, that China could preserve a capacity to hit back at the United States with at least a few nuclear bombs, even after suffering a surprise American attack. That would require that the United States accept a Chinese arsenal just large enough to outnumber any proposed defense. 
The Chinese, these experts say, would have to move beyond their reflexive condemnations and relax the hypersecrecy that has surrounded their weapons program, allowing the United States a clearer idea of the size and capability of their arsenal. They would have to convince American planners that any nuclear buildup would go only so far and would be keyed to the size of the American shield, allowing China to keep something resembling the minimal capacity for a counterattack that it has had in the past but not fundamentally altering the balance. 
The immediate goal would not necessarily be a treaty, like those the United States negotiated with the much more powerful Soviet Union to stabilize the arms race, which openly endorsed a balance of terror. 
Rather, the two countries could begin by seeking a more private and informal "strategic understanding" about the expected size of the shield, as well as the number and kinds of offensive weapons China planned to develop, Mr. Gill said. 
A serious concern, he said, is that if the American shield develops without a dialogue, then hard-liners on each side who describe "worst case" threats will be strengthened, promoting tensions and a race between offensive and defensive weapons. 
James Mulvenon, an expert on the Chinese military at the Rand Corporation who was also part of the discussions, said, "Even if China doubled or tripled its strategic nuclear forces, it would not affect the strategic balance between China and the United States, as Washington would still possess an overwhelming advantage." 
The real worry, he said, is that an arms race would seriously erode relations, and that China might supply missiles or countermeasures to the very countries a missile shield was intended to defend against. 
Even American allies are nervous about the antimissile plan because it raises the specter of the United States' shrinking from their defense. But in the end, proponents say, they will have little choice but to join in the defense plan or live with it. In any case, a shield may not be in place for a few years, until the technology is better tested and the Bush administration decides on exactly what kind of system to build.
The Russians have been hotly opposed because it may put them at a military disadvantage and upend the bilateral Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. They may never be pleased about this symbol of American technological superiority, experts say. But Russia, like the United States, retains thousands of long-range nuclear weapons -- enough to overwhelm any foreseeable defense. 
China's opposition, however, is probably the most stringent of all, and the hardest to argue away. In the 1960's, when it first developed nuclear weapons, China knew that it could not hope to compete with the United States and Russia and adopted a strategy of "minimal deterrence." Instead of matching missile forces in a costly arms race, China developed a small force under the assumption it could ride out a nuclear attack, then still hit an enemy city with a few bombs -- enough to make any opponent think twice. 
Today, China is believed to harbor fewer than two dozen long-range nuclear missiles, based in silos. As these are increasingly outdated and vulnerable, China is developing new, movable and more accurate missiles, but has never said how many it plans to build. 
Even the limited missile defense discussed by President Clinton involved 100 interceptors, enough to knock down at least 25 incoming weapons -- theoretically at least since no workable defense has ever been built. President Bush's advisers have spoken of larger scale defenses. 
In any case, "what China worries about is losing its deterrent capability," said Yan Xuetong, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Qinghua University. 
Mr. Yan said that given the political climate in Washington, he doubted whether the American president would be able to forgo the drive, urged by some hawks, to gain advantage over China. He gave some broader reasons for China's fear of the antimissile plan. 
"The United States says this is a defensive system, but everyone knows it will be used to strengthen your offensive capability," he said. "It protects your troops so you can attack any time without fear of retribution." 
"If the United States feels 100 percent secure, it may believe it doesn't need to worry about a third world war," Mr. Yan said. "This will make the American military too brave, and that will be very, very dangerous for everyone."
The more the United States is emboldened militarily, he added, the more pro-independence forces in Taiwan, too, may be encouraged to act. This could force Beijing to take drastic measures and lead to war. 
Mr. Li, the arms expert, also wondered about Washington's motives and how they would be reflected in the design of a missile shield. 
"If the United States is just worried about rogue states, it doesn't need a big defense system," Mr. Li said. "But in practice, the promoters of the missile defense want a large one, and they don't like the idea of constraining it." And while the United States says a national defense is intended for maverick states, in reality it could be used against anyone, and its size increased at any time. 
If the United States wants to reassure China, Mr. Li said, then it should limit the number of interceptors and the scale and quality of the radars and other missile-detection systems, ensuring that the system can be used only against a few missiles from a smaller power. 
"An arms race would be very bad for China," Mr. Li said. "Our priority is economic development." While China is already developing new, improved missiles, he said, "American missile defenses may force China to take a very different path."
China, he said, would definitely have to consider simple countermeasures like decoys, a large increase in the number of missiles or, perhaps most destabilizing of all, putting multiple warheads on each missile. 
Multiple-warhead missiles would add special new dangers, American and Chinese strategic experts agree. Because China would still have comparatively few missiles, the multiple warheads would make each a more tempting target for an enemy. This, in turn, could make China quicker to launch them if it feared they might be destroyed first. 
While there is no guarantee that China will not eventually deploy such missiles anyway, many experts here say that they hope to avoid it and that it does not fit well with China's overall strategy. 
Mr. Gill, the American expert, said he could give the Chinese no guarantee that President Bush would have the desire and political strength to openly legitimize China's nuclear deterrent. "But this will be much more likely," he said, trying to nudge the Chinese, "if a serious strategic dialogue gets under way."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 An oil spill in the Galapagos; an energy crisis in California; and global warming accelerating (news articles, Jan. 22, 23 and 25). Common to all is our dependence on fossil fuels: their extraction, mining, refining, transport and combustion. 
 From fragile ecosystems to choking cities, oil and coal play profoundly destructive roles. Today, the ocean is warming, ice is melting and water vapor is rising. How many disasters will it take before we adopt energy conservation policies that use clean energy sources? The proper incentives could make the energy conversion a boon to the global economy.

Yahoo charts the spread of the news by e-mail, and what it finds out is itself becoming news.

BYLINE:  By Pamela LiCalzi O'Connell 

 BODY:
WAS last week's biggest news story President Bush's education plan? Or was it the study contending that American men may have smaller penises, on average, than Brazilian men?
 One story dominated headlines; the other was forwarded frantically around the Net. And the episode provided insight into the role of the Web audience in determining, and maybe even increasing, the market value of information once it goes online. 
 People often pass around news articles via e-mail. Some even do it compulsively, in part because it's so easy: most news sites include an "e-mail this article" link on some or all of their stories. 
But until last spring, apparently, no site made use of the statistics generated by those e-mail links. That was when Yahoo News, on a lark, created a new feature called "Most-emailed content." The page (http ://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/mt/us /dailynews/?u) lists the 20 most-frequently forwarded stories and the dozen photos in the previous six hours from Yahoo News. (The Brazil story was at, or near, the top of the list for several days.)
"Most-emailed" proved to be an immediate hit, and it has become something of a cult favorite among heavy consumers of news. "We were positively surprised," said Kourosh Karimkhany, a senior producer at Yahoo News. "One of our engineers came up with the idea. It wasn't an editor." 
As a result of the page's success, Yahoo added "Most- emailed" lists for other news sections, including sports and finance. The company also created another statistics-based feature, this one a bit more conventional: "Most-viewed content," a list of the headlines and photos most clicked on in the last hour. 
"Most-viewed," which began in August, is heavy on breaking news and entertainment stories, while "Most-emailed" tends toward the quirky or bizarre. Last Thursday, for example, a news article about the pronouncements of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, topped the "Most-viewed" list, while "Man Accidentally Saws Off Hand" was No. 1 on "Most e-mailed."
"Most-viewed" and "Most-emailed" are among the most popular pages on Yahoo News, Mr. Karimkhany said, adding that similar efforts were in the works.
Danny Sullivan, who is the editor of SearchEngineWatch.com, compared the "Most" pages to the Yahoo Buzz Index and the Lycos Top 50 -- two continually updated lists of the most popular search terms. "Actually, I'm surprised it's taken them this long to turn all that fantastic live data into content," Mr. Sullivan said of the Yahoo News features.
For Yahoo, which remains heavily dependent on advertising revenue, there is every incentive to find ways to increase the page views of its material without increasing costs. 
"I think everyone is looking for ways to produce cheap content," said Robert Hertzberg, an analyst with Jupiter Research. "Using internal stats seems a sure-fire strategy. The information is there; why not use it?" 
Of course, Yahoo News is not a typical news site. It does not create articles and photos, but instead culls material from news organizations in exchange for a portion of Yahoo's ad revenues. And so far, major news sites like CNN.com and MSNBC.com seem to take a much more proprietary view of their content and how their audiences use it. 
MSNBC, for example, adds an e-mail link only to some of its articles. And while these sites sometimes issue news releases on topics -- like which streaming-media files have been downloaded the most during a particular time period -- that data is not used to repackage content into greatest-hits lists.
Michael Silberman, MSNBC.com's executive editor, said he had no interest in developing features based on, say, the most clicked story, despite the pressures to produce content more cheaply. His site has long offered a page known as "Viewers' Top 10," which lists the stories rated most highly by its readers. But the list has a different mission from Yahoo's "Most" pages, he said. 
"The purpose of this feature is to encourage users to inform other users about interesting stuff on the site -- stories not found on the cover page necessarily," Mr. Silberman said. "Our mission is not to try to generate cheap or user-created content."
Cheap or not, popular-demand content has its own intrinsic value.
"People are interested in what other people are interested in," said Sreenath Sreenivasan, a journalism professor at Columbia and administrator of the Online Journalism Awards. 
And knowing what most interests the public may prove valuable not only to consumers of news but also to the news media themselves, Mr. Sreenivasan said. He argues that journalists and editors need to pay more attention to sites like Yahoo News, because they are "changing the way readers get news."
"There's never been any medium where you get such great detail on what people are reading and talking about," he said. "What we do with that information could really change our business, if we allow it."
Others see the popularity of the Yahoo features as further confirmation of a post-modern interest in "news about news." 
"News tells us what happens," said Arthur Asa Berger, a professor who teaches about popular culture and the media at San Francisco State University. "News about news enables us to speculate about all kinds of things, trends in society and the like. And it may be more engaging than the news itself."

HEADLINE: Patents; 
No sharp deviation in policy is expected from yet-to-be-named Bush administration appointees.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
WITH a new president in the White House, one of the first orders of business for the incoming administration last week was to request that all Democratic political appointees resign their government jobs -- among them the director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 Republicans and Democrats are generally accepted to have vastly different ideas about the role of government in private industry. But the Clinton appointees who just left the patent office, as well as many career professionals who remain, say they do not expect a drastic reversal in philosophy from new leaders -- who have yet to be named by the Bush administration. 
 "I think most intellectual property issues are nonpartisan or bipartisan, so I expect a reasonable amount of continuity," Q. Todd Dickinson said last week. From 1999 until 10 days ago, Mr. Dickinson was under secretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the patent office. Now, like a lot of his senior colleagues in Washington, he is considering jobs with law firms or in private business. 
His predecessor, Bruce Lehman, who ran the agency from 1993 to 1998 and left to found a nonprofit group called the International Intellectual Property Institute, devoted to promoting intellectual property issues around the world, was even more certain that there would be no sudden policy shift.
"I can't see a single thing about the Patent and Trademark Office that clashes with Bush policy," Mr. Lehman said. "It's pretty much civics 101 that Republicans are receptive to business. And since patents, copyrights and trademarks are all about business, it would shock me if this administration was not highly supportive of the P.T.O."
He said that even though the most conservative of Republicans have a very limited view of the government's role, "the view is that government should provide the things in the Constitution -- and one of those is the patent and copyright system."
Mr. Lehman and Mr. Dickinson oversaw drastic revisions in United States intellectual property laws, which had been unchanged for decades. Mr. Lehman, in particular, took a lead in the effort to change the life span of a patent; publish patent applications 18 months after filing, whether the patent has been granted or not; and issue guidelines for patenting technologies like software and biotechnology inventions.
Their tenures coincided with a decade of transformation for the patent office, too. It morphed from a colorless agency that attracted little interest as its engineers methodically processed patent applications into a branch of government with a central role in an economy driven by inventions involving software, computers, the Internet, telecommunications and biotechnology.
Most of the policy, regulation and legislative issues that required changes to patent law or practices, and that sparked controversy, have been settled. But some remain on the congressional agenda, leaving those who remain at the patent office wondering how much more tweaking the politicians on Capitol Hill and the new leaders in the White House will advocate.
They may not begin to know that until they learn who will be the new director of patents and trademarks.
No one expects an answer anytime soon. Mr. Clinton, for example, did not propose Mr. Lehman until the March after his inauguration. Some names have been bandied about -- a solicitor general of the agency, a lawyer active in the intellectual property bar association and with inventors' groups, a former congressman.
In the meantime, the commissioner of patents, Nicholas P. Godici, has become acting director. Mr. Godici, a 28-year career employee, will probably be holding down the fort when the 107th Congress revisits some critical issues -- first and foremost, the agency's continuing battle to hang onto as much of its revenue as it can.
Since 1992, customer fees have covered the patent office's operating expenses, but every year Congress has pooled those fees into government coffers and then given only part of them back to the agency. The remainder is assigned to other parts of government.
Last year, a bipartisan effort to pass a bill ending this diversion of fees was derailed by the House Appropriations Committee. At the moment, officials at the patent office may be even less optimistic about keeping their own money, knowing that the Bush administration is keen to push a large tax cut through Congress.
"With a big proposed tax cut and significant increases in defense spending, that money has to come from somewhere," Mr. Dickinson noted. "I hope it doesn't come from the P.T.O. The biggest challenge I faced was managing with the resources given and the increasing workload and hiring freezes in place."
Mr. Lehman expressed this view: "If I have one suggestion for the Bush administration, it would be that the fees paid by users ought to go to processing patents. If you take fees and transfer them to a general fund, that's a tax. The fees are not intended to be a tax."
The agency cannot predict how the new administration will view a revival of legislation that tries to define a "business method" invention. In the last few years, patents for methods of conducting business online have become controversial. Opponents maintain that there is nothing new or patent-worthy in many of the common practices that are now being applied to the Internet, and that such patents should not be allowed.
Last session, two Democratic members of Congress proposed legislation that would change the way business-method patents are processed. The Patent and Trademark Office contended, though, that concerns over business-methods patents can be addressed by retooling agency regulations and by the courts. That could change if the new under secretary comes into office with a different view.
On a separate issue, Mr. Lehman predicted that the new president would be "pretty aggressive on the trade front."
"Intellectual property is a very big issue in trade," Mr. Lehman said. "If he's going to be aggressive on these matters, he'll need a strong Patent and Trademark Office to provide substantive background to support the issues."
The new under secretary is also likely to find Congress looking at copyright law as it affects electronic databases; technologies like the music-swapping Napster;), Internet piracy; international enforcement of intellectual property rights; a global trademark treaty; the immunity of states from patent litigation, and biotechnology areas like genomics.
Mr. Bush, for his part, has yet to state a philosophy on intellectual property issues. Patents were not a campaign subject, and the closest either candidate came to the subject may have been in repeated references to the high cost of prescription drugs. Neither mentioned patent laws or practices specifically, although a controversial part of drug prices is the exclusive rights that patents grant to pharmaceutical companies.
In fact, so far, the closest the White House has come in recent weeks to addressing intellectual property may have been on an episode of the popular television show "West Wing," in which politicians debated whether patent protections enabled drug companies to deny affordable medicine to AIDS victims in Africa.

HEADLINE: Weak Reception; 
U.S. Lagging Behind in Wireless, And That May Be Just as Well

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
IT is well documented that in the wireless revolution, the United States has fallen behind Europe and parts of Asia. But while the United States is unaccustomed to being a technology laggard, a closer look at the new uses for wireless phones overseas indicates that Americans may not be missing much.
 In South Korea, women can use their cell phones to calculate their ovulation cycles. In Britain, the user of a mobile phone can book restaurant reservations by laboriously linking to a Web site by typing on the phone's keypad (even though it would probably be faster to call the restaurant). And in Finland, arguably the most cell-phone-obsessed country in the world, consumers can use phones for such edge-of-the-envelope experiences as buying a soft drink from a vending machine. 
 In the United States, instead of bemoaning the lack of such opportunities, a growing number of industry executives and analysts contend that consumers and communications companies can only benefit by letting someone else be the guinea pigs. 
So far, in Europe and Asia, there has been little evidence that many of the wireless services can actually make money for the companies that provide them, portending an industry shakeout comparable to America's dot-com meltdown of the last year. 
As European companies in particular begin reconsidering plans to develop the wireless Internet, American companies are in a position to sit and watch, allowing them to possibly avoid costly investments in network capabilities that customers may not want. And consumers may be able to sidestep buying unnecessary devices or signing contracts for services that may be short-lived.
"You might say we acted like idiots in making such ambitious plans for the wireless Internet," Martin Varsavsky, chairman of Jazztel, a telecommunications company with operations in Spain and Portugal, said in a phone interview. "Americans have the advantage of watching us struggle a bit while they watch us put the pieces of the wireless puzzle together."
Overseas, there are signs of concern among European carriers, which spent nearly $100 billion last year in Germany, Britain and other countries to acquire radio spectrum space for the development of wireless networks capable of handling large amounts of Internet data. Earlier this month, Nokia, the Finnish maker of cell phones that is the market leader, warned of a slowdown in global demand for wireless handsets.
Despite the problems overseas, many companies in the United States are exploring uses for wireless Internet access. Carriers like Sprint PCS offer a limited menu of watered-down Web services, like text-only information from Yahoo and CNN. Small companies like PacketVideo in San Diego are hoping that live video delivered to wireless devices can evolve into a popular service. And companies, like AvantGo of San Mateo, Calif., and Handspring of Mountain View, Calif., are developing services and devices for the mobile Internet that focus on hand-held computers instead of cell phones.
"I resist the notion that we're falling behind in the U.S.," said Donald J. Listwin, chief executive of Openwave Systems, a company in Redwood City, Calif., that develops software for wireless companies in Japan, Europe and the United States. "Our entrepreneurial tendencies ensure that we will occupy the leading position in the wireless space." 
But wireless executives in the United States know that Americans are less likely to settle for watered-downed wireless Internet service because they are more accustomed to surfing the Web with PC's connected by phone lines or cables. 
That may explain why many industry officials in the United States seem comfortable watching the wireless Internet story unfold from afar. 
"Accessing the Internet on anything without a decent-sized monitor is like reading a book on Post-it notes," said Dori Merifield, a Web page designer in Santa Monica, Calif. "I'm not saying that wireless things aren't great; I'm addicted to my cell phone. But I couldn't imagine a visually appealing way to surf the Web on screens that are so small." 
This is not to say that the American communications industry is shying away from wireless Internet. On Friday, the Federal Communications Commission completed a six-week auction of licenses for newly allocated wireless radio-frequency spectrum in the United States, raising $16.86 billion. 
More than half of that amount was spent by Verizon Wireless, including more than $4 billion the company paid for two licenses for metropolitan New York. Verizon's price of more than $113 a person in the New York market was almost three times the average that European concerns spent last year in auctions in Germany and Britain. Verizon indicated that the price was justified by the potential of the New York market.
But in Europe, with its concerns about the huge investment to build wireless networks and the huge debts facing many telecommunications companies, investors have grown disenchanted with wireless plans. 
Orange, Europe's second-largest wireless company, has substantially reduced the price for its initial stock offering set for Feb. 12, some 60 percent below what analysts had been expecting when the offering was first proposed last year. And the bonds of some large European and Asian communications companies have also become riskier investments.
In the United States, by contrast, there has been a rally in the stocks of large wireless carriers, seeming vindication of the companies' efforts to sign up more customers for voice-dominated services, instead of making extravagant plans for next-generation networks. 
Since Jan. 1, shares in Sprint PCS have climbed nearly 42 percent, while AT&T Wireless stock is up more than 39 percent, Nextel Communications has risen about 28 percent and VoiceStream Wireless is up 19 percent. 
But consumers in the United States, which has the world's highest household penetration of phone lines, have not embraced the wireless phone in the way users in many other industrial nations have. Only 32 percent of America's population has cell phone service, according to figures from the International Telecommunication Union, compared with 45 percent in Japan, 46 percent in Britain, 54 percent in Italy, 59 percent in Sweden and 65 percent in Finland. 
One reason America has fallen behind in wireless communications technology is that carriers in the United States have not established a uniform national technology standard, as they have in Europe, where regulators and companies agreed to adopt a single format: the global system for mobile communications, or G.S.M.
In America, where companies have been free to choose from a variety of formats, Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS use a standard called code division multiple access, or C.D.M.A., while AT&T Wireless mainly employs time division multiple access, or T.D.M.A. Other companies, like Cingular Wireless, a venture between SBC Communications and BellSouth, use several different standards.
The incompatibilities can make it hard for customers of one company to use their cell phones in other parts of the United States where the local network may not use the same technology as their home carrier. Even within the same market, if customers wants to change carriers, they must often acquire a new phone that operates under a different technical standard. 
This patchwork approach has meant that carriers in the United States do not enjoy the same economies of scale when purchasing network equipment or handsets as their counterparts do in Europe.
Reed E. Hundt, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said that the dominance of the wired-phone industry in this country slowed the early growth of the nation's cellular industry.
"The wireline industry put its thumbs on the scales of decision at several key stages," Mr. Hundt said. He cited the pressure by large local and long-distance companies in the 1980's to limit the growth of wireless carriers by seeking to ensure that cell-phone subscribers pay for the cost of incoming calls. This practice continues today, but is not common outside the United States.
Mr. Hundt also noted that federal officials in the early 1980's thought demand for mobile phones would be weak, so they allowed duopolies to operate in large cities instead of having wider competition, which could have encouraged lower prices. 
"I think we're finally overcoming our early missteps," he said, "and moving toward having a truly competitive wireless industry."
Large European and Japanese companies, seeking to expand beyond their domestic markets, are, meanwhile, playing a larger role in meeting the demand for wireless service in the United States.
Vodafone P.L.C. of Britain acquired the American carrier AirTouch Communications in 1999 in a deal that formed the world's largest wireless communications company. Then Vodafone formed a venture with Bell Atlantic that eventually became Verizon Wireless, now the nation's largest wireless company. 
Following in Vodafone's footsteps is Deutsche Telekom of Germany, which is seeking regulatory approval to acquire the American carriers VoiceStream Communications, based in Bellevue, Wash., and Powertel, of West Point, Ga. VoiceStream and Powertel operate on G.S.M., the same technical format used by Deutsche Telekom and other European carriers.
And in November, NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest wireless company, agreed to acquire a minority stake in AT&T Wireless for almost $10 billion. The Japanese company hopes the deal will provide a way to sell its mobile Internet services in the United States. But even more so, the entrance of DoCoMo into the American market highlights how Japan has outpaced the United States in the development of the mobile Internet.
Since DoCoMo introduced a wireless Internet service known as i-mode in February 1999, the company has signed more than 13 million users who pay, on average, more than $20 a month to link to the Web on cell phones. It is the world's most popular mobile Internet service. 
"The Americans are understandably dying to mimic the success of DoCoMo in Japan," said Seiji Sanda, chief executive of Japan Communications Inc., a reseller of cell phone service in Tokyo.
Of course, some analysts have pointed out that most of DoCoMo's customers used the Internet for the first time via cell phones, instead of PC's, making their expectations of the Web different from those of Americans. About 55 percent of the population in the United States has conventional desktop Internet access, compared with about 25 percent in Japan.
Another factor that may inhibit the spread of the wireless Internet in the United States, or that may at least lead it to evolve differently, is the fact that Americans spend less time on public transportation than Japanese and Europeans, meaning there is less of a market for services that help pass time.
The question is what sort of wireless capabilities, besides standard voice calls, that Americans might actually want. 
In Europe, efforts to translate Internet content into a form that can be used on the tiny screens of cell phones have had a lackluster consumer response. More common are relatively simple services that allow users to send and receive short text messages on cell phones. 
And yet, some of the services have real utility. In Switzerland, air travelers can avoid standing in line for boarding passes by receiving a cell-phone text message from the airline with a code they can use to board a flight. In Germany, car rental companies allow customers to get cars without ever visiting a counter by interacting with the companies' Web sites via cell phones.
Companies in America might decide to to focus on more utilitarian wireless services, rather than a more glamorous array of services that would be costly to provide and expensive for consumers to obtain.
That is why wait-and-see approach to wireless may not be such a bad strategy, said Aaron Dobrinsky, chief executive of GoAmerica Communications, a company in Hackensack, N.J., that designs mobile Internet systems for wireless carriers and other kinds of companies. 
"We have the benefit," Mr. Dobrinsky said, "of looking at the battlefield from afar when forming our own strategies."

HEADLINE: Mixing Profit and Policy And Stirring Concern 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
The chief executive responded knowingly this past week to an array of detailed business questions, talking about the value of stock options, about floating several billion dollars in bonds, about how a 1.4 cent price difference between his organization and sellers of a critical resource would not stand in the way of negotiating contracts. Most of all, the chief executive spoke about a financial strategy for his organization that promises to be in place for years, perhaps a decade.
 The comments would have been unremarkable but for the fact that the organization was the state of California, and the chief executive its governor, Gray Davis. 
 The comments were a sign that something unusual was happening here as political leaders took big steps last week toward devising legislation to settle the state's unnerving energy crisis. What was critical, and all but overlooked, was not the overt details of the legislative package, but its underlying philosophy. 
The issues hidden in the details of the comprehensive rescue plan were that it could force state officials, from the governor down, to think more like business managers than public policy officials, more worried about stock prices and increasing profits than purely focused on the public good. And it could lock them into this mind-set not for a short time to get the state through the energy crisis, but for many years.
California's crisis began three years ago when the electricity market was deregulated. Under the plan, the major utilities could sell off some of their generating plants and begin buying power instead on a competitive wholesale market. The problem was that wholesale prices were freed, but retail prices were not. The result, which no one foresaw, was a catastrophe when wholesale prices soared this year to as much as 40 cents and 50 cents per kilowatt-hour, while retail prices were stuck at less than 7 cents per kilowatt-hour.
The state's two largest utilities have said they have suffered roughly $12 billion in losses in recent months because of the soaring wholesale prices, to the brink of bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the market is struggling with power shortages because many generating plants are not operating, forcing the state to contend with periodic rotating blackouts.
The legislative plan fashioned last week would have the state become the principal buyer of power, which it would then sell to consumers. It would sell billions of dollars in bonds to make those purchases at rates determined by long-term contracts, extending as long as 10 years. The utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, appear likely to receive a rate increase and to be given the right to split off a small part of every monthly bill, money they could use to pay off the $12 billion in debts.
But perhaps the most ideologically charged part of the plan is the state's proposal to take a kind of stock option in the two financially battered utilities in return for the relief. 
The idea sounds simple: if taxpayers take on a lot of financial risk in nursing the utilities back to health -- by selling state bonds to assist them in buying power or absorbing rate increases -- then taxpayers should profit with shareholders when better times return. It seems like a new-economy solution to the problem. There is a precedent. When the federal government bailed out the Chrysler Corporation in the 1970's with loan guarantees, it received stock warrants that turned a profit of hundreds of millions of dollars.
"People are very familiar with stock," Governor Davis said on Friday. "They understand stock options. They understand participation in the upside. I think that's a clear benefit."
But experts now say that owning such an interest would make the state less than a disinterested party in energy policy, an area in which it has far more influence than the federal government had over the automobile market in the 1970's. 
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute, said the most obvious problem would be applications by utilities for electricity rate increases. Any such increase could send the share prices soaring, raising the question of which impulse state regulators would follow. This is an issue that could come up with even greater force several years from now if, as expected, wholesale electricity prices start to fall, perhaps sharply, and ratepayers agitate for cuts. Who would the regulators listen to?
A longer term concern, Mr. Borenstein said, comes later, when the state is expected to begin considering introducing more competition into the power business. How would it respond to applications from other companies that want to compete directly with Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison in the retail market? That competition could drive down stock prices.
"This plan does set up serious conflicts of interest that could affect us for years," Mr. Borenstein said. "There's a reason states generally don't take equity stakes in private companies."
He added: "At the very least, this has to be treated with great caution. But the real problem is that this imposes enormous constraints on any effort to deregulate this market in the future, particularly at the retail end, perhaps for 8 to 10 years."
Aides to Governor Davis dismiss the concerns, saying, first of all, that there are simply few options, and second, that the state would never be unduly influenced by the demands of the stock market over the policy needs of the state.
At least for now, consumer advocates are skeptical, on several grounds. First of all, they feel that the utilities, their management and their shareholders should pay for the deregulation debacle, not ratepayers, who never pushed for the plan. But if the ratepayers are made shareholders, that would be impossible. Also, the advocates say the warrants would never produce a level of profits that could cover the risk taken on by taxpayers -- to the tune of many billions of dollars.
"Ultimately, there is a real conflict, but more important is the fact that this is just window dressing for a $10 billion bailout," said Harvey Rosenfield, an official at the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "If we're going to bail these companies out, we should get a dollar-for-dollar return, with interest, not a few stock warrants."
Janee Briesemeister, a senior policy analyst at Consumers Union, agreed. "Under deregulation, all California consumers got was a bunch of empty promises," she said. "Now that deregulation has failed, they're being asked to foot the bill."

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld to Pay Big Price to Avoid Conflicts 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
As he returns to the Pentagon for a second tour as secretary of defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld is being required to divest himself of an array of stocks, partnerships and other holdings at what one of his financial advisers called "a significant loss."
 Since stepping down as defense secretary during the Ford administration in 1977, Mr. Rumsfeld has leveraged his success as chief executive of two companies into a fortune valued at $50 million to $210 million, a financial disclosure form released last week indicated. 
 Nearly half of Mr. Rumsfeld's assets -- $22 million to $99 million -- are tied up in limited partnerships, including venture capital funds that invest in the health care, energy, Internet and biotechnology fields, both in the United States and in Asia, a review of the form showed. 
Like all public officials, Mr. Rumsfeld must abide by strict rules on conflicts of interest outlined by the Office of Government Ethics, but because so many companies do business with the Pentagon he must dispose of a significant portion of his portfolio, including stocks he holds in 250 to 300 publicly traded companies, his financial adviser and Pentagon officials said.
The partnerships could prove particularly difficult to walk away from without a loss. Such partnerships typically require investors to make 5- to 10-year commitments and often impose penalties for early withdrawal. Mr. Rumsfeld invested in many of those funds in the last few years, suggesting that he gave little thought to the possibility of returning to government service.
During his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, Mr. Rumsfeld acknowledged that he had "a large number of investments and activities that would have to be characterized as 'conflicts' were they to be maintained during service as secretary of defense."
He pledged to divest himself of them, and on the eve of his swearing in on Jan. 20, Mr. Rumsfeld completed what a Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, called a "lengthy and complicated agreement" involving the ethics office, the Pentagon's general counsel and the Senate Armed Services Committee.
The agreement spells out the investments that Mr. Rumsfeld must sell and provides a timetable for doing so, Admiral Quigley said.
Since then, officials have declined to release a copy of the agreement, saying its disclosure could complicate Mr. Rumsfeld's efforts to dispose of some holdings. The officials have also declined to discuss which investments are at issue.
The financial adviser, who spoke with the Pentagon's permission on the condition that he not be identified by name, said Mr. Rumsfeld needed time to notify his investment partners of his divestments and negotiate the terms of his withdrawal. He said Mr. Rumsfeld has roughly 30 such arrangements, though he declined to identify them.
"The Rumsfelds have assets that are easy to dispose of and assets that are not so easy to dispose of," the adviser said.
"He can walk away," the adviser emphasized, "at a total loss."
The limited partnership in which Mr. Rumsfeld has invested most heavily -- from $5 million to $25 million -- is Deerfield Partners in New York, a capital fund that concentrates on the the health care industry. Others include Cerberus Institution Partners in New York, the Maverick Fund U.S.A. in Dallas and two separate R. Chaney & Partners funds in Houston -- each with investments from Mr. Rumsfeld of $1 million to $5 million, the disclosure form indicated.
Underscoring the dynamics of investing in a global economy, Mr. Rumsfeld also invested as much as $500,000 last year in a venture capital fund in Shanghai with familial ties to China's political elite.
The fund, Chengwei Ventures, invests in China's burgeoning Internet market and is run by two brothers, Bo Feng and Tao Feng, whose father, Feng Zhijun, is a member of the Standing Committee of National People's Congress.
At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Rumsfeld took a hard line on China, saying in a thinly veiled criticism of the Clinton administration that it was "self-delusion" to think of the Chinese as "strategic partners." At the same time, he said, the nation's relationship with China was "complicated and multidimensional."
"On the one hand, we're somewhat a competitor," he said. "On the other hand, we're a trading partner."
After his first tour at the Pentagon, Mr. Rumsfeld, 68, was chief executive officer of G. D. Searle & Company, a pharmaceutical business, from 1977 to 1985. He later served as chief executive and chairman of General Instruments, the cable and television company. He has also was director on variety of companies, including Sears, Roebuck & Company and the Tribune Company.
Since 1997 he has been chairman of Gilead Sciences Inc., a biopharmaceutical firm in Foster City, Calif. He has 68,200 vested shares in Gilead worth from $1 million to $5 million, his form showed.
Mr. Rumsfeld also owns real estate valued at $8 million to $27 million, much of it in New Mexico. His properties include 35 acres of farmland near Taos and a parcel in Valdez, each valued at $1 million to $5 million.
His adviser said Mr. Rumsfeld had a fondness for the area that dates to the 1940's, when he went to the Philmont Boy Scout Ranch, near Taos.

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
Colin Powell's State Department, nibbling its nails about anti-globalist protests, warned Americans about traveling to the World Economic Forum in dangerous Davos, where the elite meet to not compete. But intrepid opinionmongers trekked into these Alps to learn how Chinese and Russian leaders react to Bush administration plans for a missile defense.
 Internal political paranoia in Beijing inclines its leaders to make a deal. Lee Kuan Yew, dictator of Singapore, recently cracked down on Falun Gong adherents who were stretching and breathing deeply in a public park without a permit. That showed the believers who was boss in the shopping-mall nation, but unlike the insecure dictators in China, Lee did not imprison, torture or murder them. 
 I asked Lee why Beijing was so exercised over the exercise movement. The "senior minister" suggested that when the fervor of an ideology dies, anomie sets in; gripped by the lethargy of life without meaning, people turn to new movements offering cohesion. Remembering the Boxer Rebellion, an imperfect analogy, Communism's leaders see the Falun Gong as a challenge to authority.
Other Asian observers here say that Beijing's leaders are foolishly making martyrs out of the Falun followers, much as the Romans did in seeking to suppress the nascent Christian movement. Feeling weakness within, Beijing wants a temporary accommodation with the barbarians of the West.
Hence, a Chinese position is being explored to agree to a level of U.S. missile defense that would counter blackmail from rogue states -- but, in return for inspection rights given the U.S., would not be overly effective against what China likes to think of as its own nuclear deterrent.
In Russia, a similarly happy outcome is possible, but the impetus is different from China's. The Russian regime is supremely confident of its political stability.
Vladimir Putin is building a corporate state along Peron-Pinochet lines. The K.G.B., the army and a selection of oligarchs rule through an elected president who maintains popularity by tight control of the mass media. (The last opposition oligarch, forced out of the country, is trying to sell his TV network to non-Russian media operators like Ted Turner, thought to be "untouchable" by censors.) This command combination will maintain power so long as the people have bread.
Bread is now on Russian tables mainly because OPEC has nearly tripled the price of energy, Russia's major export. The Saudi oilmen here have passed the word that oil prices will be kept up around $25 a barrel for at least a year. Add this to the delayed effect of the pre-Putin ruble devaluation, which killed imports and lately revived local industry, and Russians have a sense of not-so-hard times. 
The Chechen guerrilla war can never be won, but casualties are down and international human-rights pressure is weakening. Even Russia's democratic reformers have taken to differentiating between Chechen "bandits" and suffering Chechen people.
Those reformers are dispirited because they represent less than a fifth of the Russian electorate. The only two democratic leaders left standing -- Grigory Yavlinsky and Boris Nemtsov -- are the best long-term hope for a peaceful and prosperous nation, but they grind their teeth as Putin visits a monument to the Stalinist Andropov in the morning and honors the dissenter Sakharov in the afternoon. 
As the K.G.B.-military-oligarch clique consolidates power behind Putin, it faces a new U.S. president with firm ideas about a national missile defense. Neither bluster about the ABM treaty, nor visits to Cuba or North Korea, nor arms deals with Iran will block the new American policy. Putin will now have to deal with an inexorable Bush decision, not a forlorn Clinton hope.
And his current stability means Putin will be able to negotiate major revision of the ABM treaty or its replacement with little internal dissent. Russia's president can gain points with Americans by deploying reformers, thereby jump-starting arms control, or he can string out negotiations by demanding the U.S. abandon NATO coverage of the Baltics, which we won't buy. 
Thus do insecure leaders in Beijing and too-secure leaders in Moscow approach the changed American defense policy. Expect posturing and jockeying, but their policies must adjust to America's missile defense -- the new fact on the strategic ground.

HEADLINE: Problems Seen For Teenagers Who Hold Jobs 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Some weekdays, Alicia Gunther, 17, works past midnight as a waitress at a New Jersey mall, and she readily admits that her work often hurts her grades and causes her to sleep through first period.
 Jason Ferry, a high school junior, loves working 30 hours a week as a cashier at a Connecticut supermarket, but he acknowledges that when he gets home from work at 9:30 p.m. he usually does not have enough time to study for big tests. 
 For decades, the conventional wisdom has been that it is great for teenagers like these to hold after-school jobs because they teach responsibility, provide pocket money and keep the teenagers out of trouble.
But in a nation where more than five million teenagers under 18 work, a growing body of research is challenging the conventional wisdom and concluding that working long hours often undermines teenagers' education and overall development.
In the most important study, two arms of the National Academy of Sciences -- the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine -- found that when teenagers work more than 20 hours a week, the work often leads to lower grades, higher alcohol use and too little time with their parents and families. 
Influenced by such studies, lawmakers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Alabama and other states have pushed in recent years to tighten laws regulating how many hours teenagers can work and how late they can work. In Massachusetts, several lawmakers are seeking to limit the maximum amount of time 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds can work during school weeks to 30 hours, down from the current maximum of 48 hours.
In 1998, Connecticut lawmakers reduced the maximum number of hours 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds can work during school weeks to 32 hours, down from 48, and last year they debated imposing fines on employers who violate those limits. In New York, students that age are allowed to work up to 28 hours during school weeks, while in New Jersey the maximum is 40 hours. 
The impetus to tighten restrictions grows largely out of concerns about education, especially fears that American students are falling short on tougher standards and are lagging behind foreign students in comparative tests. While there are myriad reasons for poor school performance, legislators seeking tougher restrictions say American students would certainly do better if they placed more emphasis on work inside school and less emphasis on working outside school.
"We have 16- and 17-year-olds working 40 hours a week on top of 30 hours in the classroom," said Peter J. Larkin, the Massachusetts state representative sponsoring the bill to reduce the number of hours teenagers can work. "Something has to give, and academics seems to be taking a back seat. Sure there is pressure against the bill from employers who need teenage workers to help in a full-employment economy, but many other employers are complaining that the graduates of our high schools are not up to par."
With the national jobless rate at 4 percent, near its lowest point in three decades, many employers are eager to hire teenagers and say it would be bad for the economy and for their businesses to limit the number of hours teenagers can work.
In many states, those pushing for tougher restrictions include pediatricians' groups, P.T.A.'s, women's clubs, teachers' unions and the National Consumer League. Those opposing tighter restrictions usually include business groups and the many parents who see benefits in teenagers' working, and who have warm memories of their own first jobs as soda jerks or supermarket clerks.
Studies by the National Research Council and professors at Stanford University, Temple University and the University of Minnesota found negative effects when 16- and 17-year-olds work more than 20 hours a week. These studies concluded that students who work long hours often do not have enough time or energy for homework and miss out on social and intellectual development gained from participating in school clubs and athletic teams.
Several studies also found that 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds who work long hours tend to use alcohol more than others in their age group, largely because they have extra pocket money and copy older co-workers.
"It's probably safe for kids to work 10 hours or less each week when they're in school, but probably not such a good idea for them to work more than 20 hours," said Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University. "That's when we and other researchers find decreased academic performance and decreased engagement in school."
But many child development experts, teachers and parents said working a modest amount could be valuable for teenagers, teaching responsibility and how to work with others, as well as contributing money to financially strapped households. 
"It's a positive thing," said Ted Simonelli, a guidance counselor at Linden High School in New Jersey. "They're learning to be on time, they're learning to be good employees, they're learning a skill that they can trade on when they graduate. Many of the students in the top half of our class work after school." 
For teenagers in poor city neighborhoods, several studies have found, a job can be especially beneficial because it fosters discipline and provides needed role models.
Supporters of teenage work point to success stories like Josh Hershey, 16, of West Hartford, Conn., who took a job at an after-school child care center because it would help prepare him for the career to which he aspires: teaching. His job helped his schoolwork, he said, because it forced him to procrastinate less and focus more when doing homework.
"There are a lot of benefits to students' working in moderation," said Jeylan T. Mortimer, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. "But most sociologists and psychologists would say that it's an excessive load for full-time students to work 25 or 30 hours a week if you think it's important for young people to participate in extracurricular activities, develop friendships and spend time with their families."
A newly released study by the Department of Labor shows that 58 percent of American 16-year-olds hold jobs sometime during the school year, not including informal work like baby-sitting, while another study shows that one-third of high-school juniors work 20 or more hours each week. The Department of Labor also found that slightly more than two-fifths of 15-year-olds work, as do one in five 14-year-olds.
Several economists said the percentage of teenagers who work has remained at the same level in recent years. Although the statistics are sketchy, these experts said they believed that the number of hours students work has increased, partly because of the tight labor market.
A new study by the International Labor Organization showed that American teenagers work far more than teenagers in most other countries. The study found that 53 percent of American teenagers, from the ages of 16 to 19, work in any given week. In Japan, 18 percent of teenagers aged 15 through 19 work, while in Germany, 30.8 percent of teenagers in that age bracket work.
One recent Friday, Alicia, the waitress, a senior at Governor Livingston Regional High School in Berkeley Heights, N.J., acknowledged that she had put in a grueling week. Alicia, who works at Johnny Rockets, a 1950's-style diner at the Short Hills Mall, had missed one day of school that week and arrived late the four other days.
The reason was that she had to work past midnight on Tuesday and Thursday, and that came after working from 10:30 a.m. until 12:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
"It's fun, and I get a lot of money -- I made $240 on Saturday alone," she said, noting that she sometimes earns $40 in tips in an hour when it is busy.
"I'm not doing good in school this semester," Alicia acknowledged, her tone half rueful, half isn't-this-cool. "Because of work, I come into school late or I stay home because I'm so tired."
Joan Tonto, one of Alicia's teachers, said, "She's tired when she comes into school, and by sixth period she's too tired to work on problems in class. I've talked to Alicia about how her job is affecting her in school, and she says, 'I'm making a lot of money, Mrs. Tonto.' "
Teenage labor dates from colonial times, when many youths served as apprentices or helped sow and harvest. But with the nation's rapid industrialization came heightened concerns about teenage labor because of the increased emphasis on education and the many exposes about businesses exploiting children.
Still, many parents urge their children to work, saying it is better than sitting around watching television.
Laura Stifel, whose son Jason Ferry has the 30-hour-a-week supermarket job in Southington, Conn., saw a benefit to teenagers' working. "I think it's great that kids work because it leaves them with less time to get in trouble or be out on the street," she said.
But when she began to worry that Jason's $7.75-an-hour job was taking a toll on his grades, Ms. Stifel barred him from using his car until he got his grades back up.
In the summer of 1999, a 16-year-old Southington High School student working at an amusement park died when he stepped too close to the amusement ride he was tending and was dragged underneath. About 70 teenagers die each year in work-related accidents, and safety experts say these accidents occur because teenage workers often receive little training or supervision.
Federal regulations bar 12-year-olds and 13-year-olds from working in most jobs, with one exception being delivering newspapers. Federal rules prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from working more than three hours or past 7 p.m. on school days. The federal government places no restrictions on the hours 16- and 17-year-olds can work, leaving the matter to the states.
Jeffrey Ellenberg, who owns a dry-cleaning shop in West Hartford, likes hiring teenagers.
"We used to have quite a few more high school students working," he said. "Unfortunately, in this economy we can't get more of them. The advantage is you can train them to do what full-timers do, but you don't have to pay them the full-time wages and benefits."
At Mr. Ellenberg's shop, Rebecca Gohsler, 16, works two or three afternoons a week behind the counter and 10 hours on Saturdays. Although Rebecca's guidance counselor frets that Rebecca's job is pulling down her grades and pulling her away from extracurricular activities, Rebecca sees her $8-an-hour job as one of the best things in her life. She likes the spending money, likes chatting with customers and likes the sense of independence.
Rebecca, who hopes to become a marine biologist, said her job sometimes undercut her schoolwork. "If I just came home from work and I have a paper to write, there is a chance I might not spend as much time on it or put in enough effort," she said.
Many educators say parents should crack down on their teenagers' jobs if grades start to languish. Carol Hawkins did just that last spring, ordering her son Jon, 16, a junior at Governor Livingston High, to cut back his 20 hours a week pumping gas when his grades started to suffer.
"This year I've been able to manage my work and my school better," Jon said. "But sometimes I still have to study until 2 in the morning."
Several studies have found that 20 percent to 30 percent of teenage workers contribute to family expenses. Most use their earnings for cars, gasoline, clothes, cosmetics, cell phones, pagers and movies.
Dawne Naples, a guidance counselor at Southington High, said she advised Jason Ferry, when his grades were suffering, that it was unwise to work 30 hours a week, largely to pay for his car and gasoline. " 'The car will get you around town,' I told him, 'but what's going to get you beyond Southington High?' " she said.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
A Tumor Is Removed And Replaced by Hope

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Jennifer M., 15, who lives in a homeless shelter with her mother and 10 brothers and sisters, says she was inspired by the television series "Diagnosis Murder" to become a doctor.
 But the fact that doctors saved her life helps, too, she said. 
 To be a member of her high school track team, Jennifer had to have a physical examination. During it, a doctor discovered a lump in her abdomen that was large enough to cause a bulge from her pelvic bone to her navel. 
"She said, 'What's this in your stomach?' " Jennifer recalled. "I said, 'I don't know, I thought I was getting fat.' She said, 'No, that's not fat, there's something in there.' "
Jennifer was sent to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where doctors performed a CAT scan and an X-ray.
"It was a huge, huge abdominal mass," said Dr. Gungor Karayalcin, a cancer and blood specialist at Schneider Children's Hospital inQueens. "She looked like a pregnant woman."
Doctors performed a sonogram to see if Jennifer was pregnant. She was not. "They didn't know what it was," she said. "I was scared."
Later tests determined that the lump was a 3-by-4-inch tumor attached to one of her ovaries. The tumor contained a fast-spreading form of cancer, osteosarcoma, a bone disease that is diagnosed about 900 times a year in the United States and is normally found in the knees.
When she learned that she had cancer, Jennifer cried for an hour and a half. "I thought I was going to die," she said. Her father died of osteosarcoma shortly after she was born.
Dr. Karayalcin said his medical literature indicated that since 1952 there have been only 11 known cases of women with osteosarcoma attached to an ovary, including Jennifer's. Of the other 10 women, who ranged in age from 24 to 80, 9 are known to have died from the disease, Dr. Karayalcin said; the outcome of the 10th case was not known. Treatment has improved since the bulk of the cases, he said.
Last January, six days after her physical, Jennifer's tumor was surgically removed at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. She began chemotherapy in February with Dr. Karayalcin, who for several years had been treating her brother Duane, 13, and her sister Tiffany, 11, who have sickle cell anemia.
While she was undergoing chemotherapy, Jennifer stayed at the hospital for days at a time. The family does not own a car, so she traveled by car service, which cost $80 a round trip.
Jennifer's family did not have enough money to pay for the service, so a social worker at the hospital, Andrea Goldson, arranged for the hospital to pick up the costs with the help of three charities that assist cancer patients -- Friends of Karen, Cancer Care and the American Cancer Society. 
But the money ran out. In October, Ms. Goldson called Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Catholic Charities gave $400 from the fund so Jennifer could continue treatment.
"I tapped all the cancer organizations and they gave a limited amount of funds," Ms. Goldson said. "Catholic Charities was almost a last resort, but it's a last resort that always comes through."
About the time Jennifer's chemotherapy began, her family was forced out of its apartment in East New York, Brooklyn, because the kitchen floor collapsed into the basement boiler room. Jennifer's mother, Shirley, who mailed her rent checks to a post office box, said she could not contact her landlord to have it fixed because she did not know who her landlord was.
"It was caving in slowly, and eventually it just dropped," Shirley said. "I packed up what I could, got the kids together and went to a shelter."
For the first four months, the family lived in a city-run shelter in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. Shirley; her boyfriend, Anthony, who is unemployed; and 11 children lived in a single room with 10 beds, Shirley said.
They were then transferred to a shelter in East New York, where they now have five bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen.
"It's better," said Shirley, who receives welfare and food stamps as well as Supplemental Security Income for Jennifer and her two children with sickle cell anemia. "But it's still not comfortable because it's not home."
But Shirley predicted that 2001 would be better for the family. She has a meeting with the New York City Housing Authority today and hopes that the family will be accepted into a housing project.
And now that the chemotherapy has been completed and the cancer is in remission, Dr. Karayalcin said Jennifer would probably live a long, healthy life. 
"We are expecting that she would be cured."

HEADLINE: Fury Over Tolls Doesn't Diminish Port Authority's Grand Ambitions 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
It is a transportation plan, of course, a $14 billion building program that will equal all the spending the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has undertaken in its 80 years of existence.
 But when officials try to justify the increases in tolls and fares on the crossings between New York and New Jersey announced last week, they speak as often about economics as about transportation. 
 The authority last week voted to raise fares on PATH trains to $1.50 from $1, beginning March 25. Fares at bridges and tunnels between New York and New Jersey will rise to $6 from $4. E-ZPass users will pay $5 at peak hours and $4 at other times. 
During the public hearings on the capital plan and the proposed toll and fare increases, it was the higher fees that drew the most comment and fire.
The ambitious building plan sometimes seemed to have been forgotten. Officials say the program is necessary not just to cut down on traffic congestion or get people to work, but also to maintain the region's economic strength.
"This region takes bricks and mortar for granted, but they must be maintained," said Chris Ward, the Port Authority's director of planning and external affairs. "We need to be able to move people and goods efficiently if we want to keep the economy from dragging, and the pressing issue is: does this region have the capacity and will to build large-scale projects and put aggressive infrastructure plans out there?"
And while there has been little argument over the long-term economic impact of the spending program, there is less certainty over a secondary economic benefit some see -- the plan's role in the short run as a spur to the slowing economy. And some critics question whether the spending is properly divided between New York and New Jersey and whether it is fair to increase tolls at bridges and tunnels and fares on PATH trains as a way to pay for the projects.
Proponents say the plan will, among other things, prompt $500 million in private investment by port tenants. Officials point to the importance of continuing the rebuilding and privatization of the authority's three commercial airports to accommodate growing travel and larger planes.
Over the next five years, the capital construction plan will mean $3 billion in airport improvements, with $1.3 billion going to Newark for new access roads, monorail connections and terminal expansions; $1 billion to Kennedy for new and expanded terminals; and $700 million to La Guardia for improvements and new construction. 
In the port category, $1.8 billion is to be devoted to dredging channels to accommodate the larger cargo ships coming into use, rail connections at dockside and development of the Howland Hook container port on Staten Island. For the PATH line, proceeds from the fare and toll increases will help finance $1 billion for larger cars to replace the rail line's 35-year-old rolling stock, station improvements and expansion to accommodate longer trains and new switching technology intended for speedier travel.
And for most of the Hudson River crossings, $1.6 billion will be spent for state-of-the-art systems that through a network of electronic signs along the highway alert drivers to congestion on the bridges and tunnels and their approaches quickly so that drivers can alter their routes. The plan also envisions ramp improvements at several crossings and a second span to supplement the narrow Goethals Bridge connecting New Jersey and Staten Island.
Accommodations for increased road traffic, like the additional Goethals Bridge span, drew the most fire. The Staten Island borough president, Guy V. Molinari, said the borough would rather see the estimated $300 million go to a new north shore rail line, and the Tristate Transportation Campaign contended that the extra capacity would only increase car traffic and air pollution.
The toll and PATH fare increases approved Thursday will have little effect on the building plan, officials said. 
In the shorter term, some supporters of the proposal suggested that the spending would provide a "countercyclical" force to help shore up the region's economy, which most projections suggest is slowing.
Not everyone is convinced that the plan will have much of an effect on the economy. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said there was nothing wrong with using construction programs to promote a "soft landing" during slowdowns.
But the timing of such projects is imprecise and they cannot always be revved up when they are most needed, he said.
Ray Horton, chairman of the management division at the Columbia University business school and a former president of the Citizens Budget Commission, agreed. "People have come to realize that they don't happen quickly enough if they happen at all," he said. 
Still, Mr. Ward, the Port Authority planning director, contended that by shoring up the construction industry with $14 billion in spending, the agency would provide about 300,000 jobs and the consumer spending that goes along with that. And one should not underestimate the importance of such spending if there is a "soft landing," he said.
For many of the port agency's critics, the capital program and the toll and fare increases were just more ways to fill the agency's coffers, said Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota of New York City. The Giuliani administration has been a frequent critic of the Port Authority and has questioned the need for its existence.
For Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, the toll and fare increases were "a regressive form of taxation," which he said the bistate agency ought to abandon in favor of cutting its debt and financing much of its capital program with current revenue. 
John S. Dyson, chairman of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Council of Economic Advisers, also said the agency's spending was not proportionately focused on New York City, which has 70 percent of the region's population and generates an equal amount of its revenue. The city and projects within its borders get less than half the spending in the capital plan, he said.
According to the Port Authority's calculations, which are disputed by critics in both New York and New Jersey, nearly 40 percent of the five-year plan's spending will apply to New York, while 27 percent applies to New Jersey. The remainder is categorized as "interstate" spending that is beneficial to both.
For all its size, the plan is not all the Port Authority has in mind.
Some officials say the plan would position the region for growth that would generate the revenue needed for even grander projects in the future -- possibly another Hudson River crossing for cars and a tunnel for rail freight and commuter lines.
"Unless we provide the infrastructure now, the economy can't expand," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress. "This is what the Port Authority was set up to do."

Ad Slump Means Uneven Future for Newspaper Industry

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
The theme park of the national economy reopened one of its most exciting rides last quarter: the advertising roller coaster. With the newspaper industry aboard, it roared down into a tunnel, where it was jolted by the shocks of retail bankruptcies.
 Now the industry is headed for a blind curve. If you want to know what happens next, get in line behind the ad directors of Belo, Dow Jones & Company, E. W. Scripps, Knight Ridder, The New York Times Company and The Tribune Company. 
 The first crop of fourth-quarter earnings reports shows the dip: Tribune, which publishes The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, Newsday and eight other newspapers, said that compared with the similar period in 1999 retail advertising was flat while classified dipped about 3 percent and national fell 8 percent, thanks to the slowdown in dot-com and airline advertising.
At Knight Ridder, which publishes The San Jose Mercury News, The Philadelphia Inquirer and 29 other daily papers, fourth-quarter retail advertising revenue dropped 0.2 percent, general, or national revenues rose 7.5 percent while classified revenues rose 1.6 percent compared with the same period in 1999; for the month of December, all three categories showed declines.
At Dow Jones's flagship, The Wall Street Journal, advertising volume fell 9 percent in the fourth quarter and 24 percent in December.
As the unpleasant details of December are revealed, the early signs in January reflect a lingering weakness in many markets. 
The "Super Job Sunday" sections of classified employment advertising that usually fatten newspapers' winter revenues are not their old chubby selves; in some markets, their ribs are showing. Film studios and retailers have balked at proposed rate increases, asking, with more acerbity than usual, why they should pay more for a medium whose audience is declining. 
Some retailers, like Montgomery Ward, GE Capital's Chicago-based chain, or Bradlees, that staple of New England malls, will not be around to argue --they have filed for bankruptcy. Others, like J. C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck & Company, are closing scores of stores.
The usual optimists are guarded -- with the notable exception of William Drewry, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, who pointed out that so far, there have been few surprises: Companies have met Wall Street's expectations, despite strained circumstances. "Newspaper ad trends are holding up better than expected," he argues. He acknowledges that advertising spending will be bumpy in some markets, but believes the comparisons between 2000 and 2001 will improve as the year goes on.
John Sturm, president of the Newspaper Association of America, said that there had been welcome surprises in the fourth quarter, including unexpected auto company advertising. But, he said, one of his colleagues wondered ruefully if that spending was "the storm before the calm."
And Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said she sees little reason for optimism. She gives newspaper companies high marks for controlling costs, but questions how classified advertising revenue this year will equal or exceed that of the boom times many markets experienced in early 2000.
Ad rate increases are often newspapers' response to a slowdown in advertising volume, and this year is no different. Executives from both Knight Ridder and the Tribune Company told analysts last week that the single-digit advertising revenue growth that they were projecting for 2001 would be driven largely by rate increases.
Which makes some people angry, particularly the Hollywood movie studios, which are beginning to balk. As Amy Gruberg of DreamWorks SKG said last week, "increases should be based on merit and not just expenses." If newspaper circulation is generally declining, Ms. Gruberg asks, why should they pay more?
To which newspaper advertising directors are likely to respond: show me another established medium that does better at keeping its audience. 
There is not too much they can say to retailers that have shut their doors and filed for bankruptcy. Montgomery Ward announced on Dec. 28 that it would close all its 250 stores. Bradlees is closing 105 stores in six states. J. C. Penney is shutting 47 of more than 1,100 stores.
Still, Mr. Drewry and others say that many markets, particularly midsize ones, where the newspapers of E. W. Scripps and Lee Enterprises showed solid gains in the fourth quarter, reflect the businesses' relative strength. 
Classified advertising is almost equal to retail advertising in its importance to the industry. Here, the outlook is uncertain at best. Charles Diederich, who tracks help-wanted ads for the Newspaper Association of America, said that employers seemed more cautious. "We're not seeing the losses we would if we were clearly in a recession," he said. "But we're certainly seeing a pulling back."

DoubleClick Still Faces An Uphill Battle
Now that the Federal Trade Commission has dropped its investigation of DoubleClick's online advertising practices, the company has come a long way since the days when its name was widely seen as synonymous with privacy invasion.
 Even so, the company has a few more smaller fires to put out. Moreover, its chief issue may be how to regain the revenue momentum that vanished along with so many of its dot-com clients. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. Page C4. 

Intranets Start Earning Their Keep
A growing number of organizations are putting new energy into using their intranets -- in effect, internal Web sites -- to perform functions that go well beyond simple publication of memos and company news. Ronda Rattray, who works in I.B.M.'s small-business group from her home in Atlanta, can pause for an afternoon to do volunteer work at her son's high school, and in the evening log onto the intranet and resume working.

Stigmatizing, or Protecting a Child?
After the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson acknowledged that he had fathered a child in an extramarital affair with a former staff member, Time magazine and The National Enquirer each published photographs of the girl. Time showed her face and name from a picture that had been sent to one of its columinists as a Christmas card. Despite its gossip-at-any cost reputation, The Enquirer obscured her face and did not use her name. C14.

New Merrill Lynch Campaign
In an advertising campaign scheduled to begin late this week, Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, is making no secret that it also wants big investors. The advertisements, with the actor Steve Martin providing voice-overs, are aimed at the wealthiest households in America, those with $1 million or more to invest. Advertising. C19.

HEADLINE: Mexican Jail Easy to Flee: Just Pay Up 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
The maximum security Puente Grande prison is supposed to be one of the toughest in all Mexico: two guards for each convict, hundreds of isolation cells, sophisticated video surveillance. There was only one way out for Joaquin Guzman, serving 20 years as one of the nation's biggest cocaine traffickers.
 He bought his way out. 
 Mr. Guzman needed plenty of help to escape on Jan. 19, and he got it. Someone opened his electronically secured cell. Someone disabled the video cameras. Someone smuggled him onto a laundry truck in a burlap bag, and someone drove him away. 
All this has driven President Vicente Fox and his new public security chief, Alejandro Gertz Manero, to towering rages. It offered evidence, as if more were needed, of how the law in Mexico can be bent with a fistful of money.
Mr. Fox has inherited a system so dirty that no amount of purging seems to cleanse it. Mr. Fox himself said that "the pervasive influence of dirty money" had infected "law enforcement organizations and dishonest government bureaucrats" throughout Mexico.
"The corruption of the past can't be ended overnight," he said Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, "but now we are truly trying to eradicate it."
As the president vowed to win that war, Mr. Gertz said the nation's drug gangs had taunted the new government, which took office last month, by sending threatening and impudent messages warning of political assassinations. "In our country," he said, "throughout its existence, and especially in the last few years, forces have arisen that are much stronger and more effective than the official ones. Cloaked by political corruption for generations, they have truly become overwhelming."
In the last few years, the federal anti-drug chief, who was an army general, and other senior military officers fighting the war on drugs, along with the chief of the federal police and hundreds of his subordinates, have been accused of being bought off by the cocaine cartels. 
The nation's attorney general fired more than 1,400 of 3,500 federal police officers for corruption -- or two out of every five members of the force -- and prosecuted 357 of them.
When Mr. Guzman's colleague in the Sinaloa drug cartel, Hector Luis Palma Salazar, was arrested in Guadalajara a few years back, 34 police officers -- his bought-and-paid-for private protection force -- went to jail with him. 
Seven prominent members of the Juarez cartel now doing time were law enforcement agents who turned to a more lucrative line of work.
The problem long ago entered Mexico's prisons, where "an entrenched system of corruption undermined authority and led to abuses," according to the State Department in Washington. Almost anything can reportedly be bought in prison -- drugs, sex, liquor -- including, apparently, freedom.
Mr. Guzman, who is 45 years old and 5 feet 6, is known as El Chapo, or Shorty. He began his career as a kind of air traffic controller overseeing drug flights within Mexico. Then he went into business for himself.
He grew so successful that a rival drug gang tried to rub him out, and one of Mexico's two Roman Catholic cardinals, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, was killed in the crossfire. Cardinal Posadas died at the Guadalajara airport in 1993 when the gang's gunmen fired on his car, apparently thinking it was Mr. Guzman's.
That year, Mr. Guzman was arrested on drug trafficking and murder charges. But his organization lived on. United States drug enforcement officials said it transported tons of Colombian cocaine a month through Mexico to the United States. 
It even appears to have built a 1,500-foot, concrete-reinforced, air-conditioned cocaine smuggling tunnel between Tijuana and Otay Mesa, Calif., near San Diego. The organization's profits could have been used to grease the way for Mr. Guzman's escape.
Corruption at the Puente Grande prison, which is outside Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco, was no secret. Guards complained a year ago to the state human rights commission that their bosses were forcing them to comply with the system of selling privileges and protection to prisoners. The state commission sent its report to the federal government but received no response until two weeks ago, when Mr. Fox's administration ordered an investigation.
The coincidence of the investigation and the escape did not go unnoticed. Nor did the fact that the escape came the day after Mexico's Supreme Court ruled that criminals like Mr. Guzman, who is wanted in the United States, could face extradition and interrogation by American authorities.

HEADLINE: Unarmed Threats 

 BODY:
Ready or not, the Bush administration is going to find itself dealing with challenges to American safety and well-being that were not considered serious security threats during the last Republican administration eight years ago. Familiar issues like terrorism and nuclear proliferation now must share the foreign policy agenda with threats that carry no weapons. Environmental damage, water shortages, mass movements of refugees, overpopulation, infectious diseases and even third-world poverty all affect American security. Some of these problems can intrude on our soil. But all can lead to the kind of instability and conflict that has frequently warranted American intervention.
 Disease is the most immediate problem, and the one most likely to affect Americans directly. The world's poorest people are suffering from new diseases such as AIDS, more virulent strains of old sicknesses such as drug-resistant tuberculosis and an increase in illnesses once thought to be under control, such as malaria. Germs and viruses easily emigrate by plane. In the early 1990's, it cost $1 billion to eradicate 1,000 cases of resistant tuberculosis in New York City. 
 Over the next 10 years, AIDS is likely to cripple the economies of many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Millions of orphans are growing up on the streets. Entire countries may come to the brink of collapse as they lose their most economically active people. Waves of refugees could destabilize neighboring nations. 
Overpopulation and environmental devastation have already contributed to similar situations on a smaller scale. The Clinton administration intervened in Haiti largely to prevent a flood of new refugees in Florida. Haiti's criminal leadership was the immediate cause of the problem, but the country's rapid rates of population growth and deforestation contributed to its misery and the desire of Haitians to flee. Similar problems fueled conflict in Somalia, Rwanda and other countries. 
Since it is difficult to arouse sufficient interest in these problems before they become catastrophes, Washington has normally waited until a crisis develops before taking action. George W. Bush would be well served to invest in alleviating problems before they require large infusions of money or even the introduction of American military forces.
Washington, for example, should help rebuild the health system in Russia, which now has one of the world's fastest-growing rates of H.I.V. infection and an epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Mr. Bush should also treat AIDS in Africa as a security threat. The United Nations estimates that it would take $1.5 billion to institute effective prevention campaigns all over Africa, and the same amount to care for AIDS patients and their orphans. Health officials believe that AIDS can be treated in Africa with the same medicines Americans get if the West helps pay. Working with European nations on these problems now could save millions of lives and billions of dollars later. 
The Bush administration could also help prevent future problems by endorsing the 1997 Kyoto accord on greenhouse gases. An authoritative report has concluded that man-made gases contributed substantially to the rise in temperature over the last 50 years. Global warming, many experts believe, has led to devastating floods and hurricanes in tropical areas, and could eventually produce drought in America's breadbasket. Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress must balance their desire to protect the profits of American businesses with a determination to set emission and other environmental standards that reduce the production of harmful gases.
Dealing with problems like disease and environmental destruction will require foresight, creativity and a willingness to take political risks. They are often called "soft" security threats, but today they can pose a greater worldwide danger than anything that comes from the barrel of a gun.

HEADLINE: Talk Show Debut Suggests Cheney Role 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
In his first days in office last week, Vice President Dick Cheney spent a lot of time sitting silently by President Bush's side in meetings with lawmakers at the White House.
 Then came Mr. Cheney's voluble debut on talk radio. 
 In an interview with the conservative talk-show host Oliver North, Mr. Cheney called for building power plants in Mexico to help energy-stricken California. He also warned that "you've got to be willing to deal with some bad guys" to combat terrorists. And he declared that "it's entirely possible" that Mr. Bush might accelerate his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan. 
At center stage, in the White House meetings or on the Sunday television news program circuit, Mr. Cheney was the dutiful No. 2 man, adding quiet ballast to Mr. Bush's headliner act or reinforcing the administration's message without making front-page news himself.
But behind the scenes and beyond the capital's klieg lights, Mr. Cheney's first week on the job offered an intriguing glimpse into how he will exert his considerable influence.
Every week, for example, Mr. Cheney plans to give interviews to selected regional print, radio and television commentators outside Washington. If his remarks today and last week were any sign, Mr. Cheney will loosen up and detail to his party's faithful the administration's views on a wide range of topics.
"We want to move beyond the Beltway bubble to take our message directly to local media outlets," said Juleanna Glover Weiss, Mr. Cheney's spokeswoman. (Mr. Cheney's first three interviews as vice president were with Mr. North on the Radio America Network; with Sean Hannity, the conservative host of Fox News Channel's "Hannity & Colmes"; and on the "Hoppy Kercheval Show," a statewide radio program in West Virginia.)
Mr. Cheney also plans to spend a lot of time on Capitol Hill every week, listening to lawmakers, mapping out legislative strategy and, when needed, casting tie-breaking votes in the evenly divided Senate. He joined Republican senators at their regular luncheon on Tuesday in what is likely to become a weekly ritual.
Republicans said Mr. Cheney has already played an important role in Mr. Bush's first initiatives.
"He's been involved on the education bill and he'll be involved on the tax-cut conversations, too," Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, said.
Today, Mr. Cheney played administration point man on three of the Sunday television talk shows. He urged Congress to act on Mr. Bush's tax cut plan, announced that top administration aides would meet on Monday to discuss energy problems in California and nationwide and predicted that Congress would pass a bill to overhaul the country's campaign finance laws but stopped short of promising that Mr. Bush would sign it.
For a man who many political analysts say is this young administration's all-powerful prime minister, Mr. Cheney was in no danger of upstaging his boss in Week One or the beginning of Week Two.
Mr. Cheney called influential members of Congress last week, but he and his aides declined to say which ones. Foreign leaders called to chat with Mr. Cheney, a former secretary of defense who is on a first-name basis with many international figures. But the vice president and his staff declined to say which ones.
In fact, when asked how his first working week went, Mr. Cheney responded through Ms. Glover Weiss by talking about his boss: "President Bush clearly likes being president and is good at it."
Mr. Cheney is a disciplined man who along with other experienced government hands, like the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., a fellow veteran of the first Bush administration, has brought a sure-footedness to this White House in its early days.
Indeed, in an administration in which Mr. Cheney holds sway, distractions from the White House's carefully planned objectives -- be they people or issues -- will probably be weeded out. For example, when Mr. Hannity asked last week whether Mr. Bush's first choice for secretary of labor, Linda Chavez, should have stayed after it was reported that she had sheltered an illegal immigrant for two years, Mr. Cheney took a tough line.
"No, I think she made the right decision," he said. "It's gotten to be a very rough business, and cabinet secretaries that we nominate have to be able to go through that process and come out the other side without giving your opponents ammunition to use against you."
Some of Mr. Cheney's most revealing comments came on the talk-radio programs last Wednesday. When Mr. North asked how the Bush administration would deal with terrorism, Mr. Cheney was blunt on an important method. "You've got to be willing to deal with some bad guys to collect intelligence on bad guys," he said.
The vice president was equally plain-spoken when asked about California's energy crisis. He blamed Californians for approving a "flawed" deregulation plan and for not building power plants to keep pace with the state's growth.
"There's been, I think, a bit of a tendency in California to think they could sort of block everything," he told Mr. North. "Nobody wanted to go forward with any project in their neighborhood."
One solution, Mr. Cheney suggested, would be to build new power plants in Baja California, just across the border in Mexico.
"It would help the Mexican economy, create jobs and provide additional power for them as well," he told Mr. North.
In a fairly risk-free week, one of the few chances Mr. Cheney seemed to take was telling Mr. Hannity that he would be rooting for the underdog in tonight's Super Bowl game: the New York Giants.

HEADLINE: As Industrial Jobs Decline, Training Programs Grow 

BYLINE:  By JULIE CONNELLY; Julie Connelly is a contributor to Corporate Boardmember magazine.

 BODY:
CHERYL SPAIN, a member of the Communications Workers of America union and a computer network associate at AT&T's Middletown, Va., EasyLink billing center, figures she has taken at least three dozen training courses over the years to pick up new skills.
 At 44, Ms. Spain is now certified to work with Microsoft office software programs, like Word and Excel, and various databases. She has passed the Data Technician Knowledge test and is eligible for promotion to the next job grade, computer network associate Level 3, which pays more than her Level 2 job. She is currently enrolled in a distance learning course at Penn State to earn a customer relations certificate. 
 "Some day I want to have a business at home, and I knew that classes would help me keep up with computers," she said. 
Ms. Spain is a mother of two children and has taken most of these courses on her own time, after putting in an eight-hour workday. Why is she doing all this? Because when AT&T started selling factories, that was "a wake-up call to a lot of people to keep up their skills," she said. AT&T sold the circuit-board plant where she worked in Richmond four years ago and transferred her to Middletown, about 125 miles away. That plant has been shed as well. 
Like white-collar workers, blue-collar workers are learning that job security is not seniority anymore; it's employability. As a result, laboring men and women are taking more responsibility for their careers, improving skills that they can market to many employers over their lives. "This is Me Inc. at the labor union level," said Marshall Goldberg, the executive director of the Association of Joint Labor-Management Educational Programs in New York. 
Blue-collar workers are going back to school in record numbers. "The American labor movement is the second largest post-secondary source of education after the college and university system," said Susan J. Schurman, the president of the George Meany Center-National Labor College in Silver Spring, Md. 
These training programs represent a policy shift because they are a collaborative effort between union and management. Companies benefit by having better-educated employees who are more likely to stick around. Training programs give unions, which also compete for workers, an advantage in organizing the workplace, especially when union membership, as a percentage of the work force, declined to 13.5 percent of nonfarm workers last year, the lowest point in 60 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
As for workers, "We did studies to see what happened to those who were trained and laid off," said Donald Treinen, a co-director of the Alliance for Employee Growth and Development in Landover, Md., which runs programs for the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. "They got replacement jobs at higher wages quicker than workers who weren't trained." 
The loss of traditional union jobs, which started with the devastating industrial restructuring of the 1980's, continues. The Boeing Company recently completed a layoff of 12,000 workers, and even new-economy industrial jobs are disappearing. But labor now knows that workers' skills must be kept current and that technology should be viewed as a career enabler and not a job destroyer. 
"We tell the workers in our programs that lifelong learning is necessary today," said Harmon Lisnow, the executive director of the Institute for Career Development in Merrillville, Ind., a joint program between the United Steelworkers of America and 13 steel companies. "To continue to support yourself and your family, you're going to have to go to school." 
Rafael Cruz, a 41-year-old USX Corporation steelworker in Gary, Ind., added: "The mills are computerized. It's not brawn anymore. It's technical." Courtesy of the institute, Mr. Cruz is studying for a Bachelor of Arts degree in labor studies. 
Unions began negotiating in the 1980's for retraining allowances for laid-off workers and those still employed. Joint labor-management educational programs became part of collective bargaining, whereby employers agreed to set aside money for training, usually based on a formula of so many cents per worker per hour, including overtime. Workers agreed to defer part of the wage increase for training dollars.
The programs are run as independent, nonprofit entities, staffed equally by union and management representatives. In 1998, a number of programs in the aerospace, automotive, health care, steel and telecommunications industries, as well as in state government, formed the Association of Joint Labor-Management Educational Programs. This umbrella group gives members a louder roar when testifying before Congress about issues affecting them.
The range of education and training offered by the joint programs is wide. Unless the curriculum is sponsored by the employer, workers take courses on their own time, which is why completion rates vary. "Anything over 50 percent is good," said Meg Benke, the director of the Center for Distance Learning at the State University of New York Empire State College in Saratoga, N.Y., which keeps track of these things.
There are classes for hobbyists, like photography and culinary arts, as well as remedial, basic and advanced courses that help workers earn high school equivalency degrees, learn English as a second language, brush up on math or upgrade technical and communications skills. Workers can earn certifications like the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineers. There are also college-level courses leading to associate's and bachelor's degrees.
Workers are taught through a combination of traditional classroom teaching at on-site centers, videoconferencing and online. 
Despite the variety, the joint programs focus mostly on job-related skills. For example, the Enhanced Training Opportunities Program, run by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in conjunction with Lucent Technologies and Avaya, is sponsoring the first new apprenticeship program in 25 years.
It has contracted with Northern Illinois University in Itasca, Ill., to create the academic portion of the training of production technologists, a new category of worker expert in all aspects of the production line. What distinguishes this program is the lack of journeyworkers to teach the apprentices. The apprentices, chosen because they have some of the skills required to be production technologists, cross-train each other. 
When they graduate four years from now, the Department of Labor will certify the apprentices as journeyworkers. If Avaya, which makes communications systems and software, does not have jobs for them, the journeyworkers have a credential they can take to other telecommunications employers.
Worker training is not new, of course, but access to the training, and therefore higher-paying jobs, was limited to workers who were chosen by the employer or by the union on the basis of seniority.
The joint programs opened up training to all union members. For example, the IAM-Boeing program, run by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and Boeing, has been creating a large online career guide. When completed this year, the guide will list the skills required for 500 Boeing manufacturing jobs, including the entry-level positions for which workers can request transfers.
Workers can access the guide on the Boeing intranet, then talk to an adviser about training for a transfer. The workers undergo rigorous training, and when they have passed the courses, taken on their own time, their names go into a pool of employee-requested transfers. Management is obliged to draw from the pool first to fill entry-level openings.
"As an hourly worker, you're in control of your career path," said Patrick Parmley, a co-director of IAM-Boeing in Tukwila, Wash. "You look at the guide, figure out where you want to be and what you have to do to get there. Management knows it is filling jobs with people who have the skills to do them." 
The joint programs are also reawakening a trait in the workplace -- loyalty. Randy Noak, 52, dropped out of college at 19 to raise a family and work in the steel mills; he has earned two undergraduate degrees through the Institute of Career Development. When he hit his retirement two years ago, Mr. Noak left the mills to join a Chicago software company, where he earned less money but didn't have to work a shift.
Last year, the institute recruited him to become a program specialist monitoring training programs. He took the job. "I felt I owed a debt to the steel industry," he explained. "If I could help one other steelworker get to the point that I got to, I'd have given back."

HEADLINE: The Permanent Stopgap in Staffing Is Still a Temp 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
THE Post-it notes march methodically along the wall of Dan Gold's bland and beige cubicle. An unpacked cardboard box of tchotchkes sits on the floor. 
 Mr. Gold has to submit expenses through his boss. His time sheets have been questioned. No office party invitation this Christmas. ("I wouldn't have gone anyway," he said, without rancor.) 
 Mr. Gold is a temporary worker placed by an agency, or as he prefers to put it, a freelancer, which means a life of small indignities and large freedoms. A former actor who became an account executive in advertising, Mr. Gold, 31, is at liberty to mark time as a "temp" at a financial services company in Manhattan while waiting for his permanent dream job at an advertising agency specializing in the theater. He is free to learn the creative end, writing and producing radio spots in the company's marketing department. 
With the economy entering a downturn, he may have a lot more free time. Or maybe not. 
While temporary workers are the first to go when times get tight, experts say, companies that have laid people off realize that they have holes to fill. With less money available for permanent hires, they fill the gaps with short-term workers.
"I'm sure over the next six weeks 'temping' is going to skyrocket," said Margaret Luca, president of M. Luca & Associates, a New York temp agency catering to professionals.
So Mr. Gold's prospects are not so bad. In fact, he belongs to the fastest-growing segment of temporary workers: professionals, which includes lawyers, marketers, accountants, even scientists. The number of such workers grew 26 percent over 1999 and 2000, thanks to the tight labor market, and is expected to grow as much in the next two years, according to Staffing Industry Analysts Inc., a market-research company in Los Altos, Calif., that publishes industry trade journals. 
This group is a small minority -- 4 to 6 percent, including legal, accounting and the creative professions -- among the 3.3 million temporary agency workers in the United States. Temp agency workers are part of a legion of Americans who fall outside the category of traditional full-time employees -- freelancers, consultants, independent contractors, the self-employed -- who may make up as much as a third of the work force, as estimated by former Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich.
Most temporary agency workers are clerks, laborers or manufacturing workers. Temps are more likely than permanent workers to be women, under 25, high school dropouts and black or Hispanic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nearly three-fifths prefer not to work for a temp agency because they would rather have full-time employment.
Not so with professionals like Mr. Gold, who was placed by Paladin Marketing and Advertising Staffing Solutions, a Chicago-based professional temp agency with an office in New York.
Chris Knof, 27, who graduated from college in 1996 with a degree in graphic design, has been working as an account executive at Bozell New York, the advertising agency, since May. She has been temping for two years, which has given her the chance to try out different kinds of accounts -- "dating before I get married," she said -- and "branding" herself as an adaptable worker. Health care benefits and more stability would be nice, though.
Patsy Lo, 31, another advertising account manager, likes avoiding the stress of the career track that comes with a permanent job. "Getting screamed at by the client" is easier to deal with, she said. After working for two months on assignment as a junior account superviser, Ms. Lo was hired full time at Customer Strategies Worldwide Inc., a marketing and advertising consultancy in New York. 
Mr. Gold, a Chicago native, was laid off from a full-time job as an account executive in 1999 and then had a miserable and very brief experience at a small interactive ad agency. "There I was, kind of like, 'Help!,' because I was so unhappy," he said. He turned to Paladin, which placed him at an ad agency that handled hotel accounts, and most recently at the financial services company. Mr. Gold agreed to speak only on condition that the company not be identified. Staffing agency officials say employers are often reluctant to acknowledge that they use temporary workers because they consider the makeup of their work force to be proprietary information.
Other companies may be leery of legal action. As the way Americans work has changed in the last decade, with more people working flexible hours, part time or from home, employers are facing lawsuits demanding that long-term temporary workers receive benefits from them.
In one of the biggest such cases, Microsoft agreed last December to pay $97 million to settle an eight-year-old class-action lawsuit brought by workers who said the company hired them as temps through agencies to avoid paying benefits.
Mr. Gold is ready to move on, but said that he values what he has learned at the financial services firm. The Post-it notes in his cubicle chronicle a busy, purposeful schedule: calls to outside ad-agency representatives, deadlines for radio and print copy, appointments for recording sessions and in-house strategy discussions. 
"It can be pretty hectic because there's a lot of balls in the air at once," he said of his job. "I do feel that I'm a plate spinner a lot of the time; it's good for me because I just prefer to be busy. Especially as a freelancer, the busier I am, the less chance that they are going to decide there's no need for me."
One Post-it reminds him to buy tickets: he is something of a theater nut, seeing two or three shows a week. "I have seen every single show that has opened on Broadway since I have been here, and many, many others," he said.
He misses having an office and the ability to make decisions without someone looking over his shoulder, but is happy to have a job after a tough year of losing one, suffering health problems and seeing his apartment burned in a building fire. The pay is not bad. Mr. Gold said he earns in the "upper echelon" of five figures, perhaps a bit more than if he were a full-time employee because the company does not have to provide him benefits.
Freelance work not only means no company health plan but also no paid vacation. Paladin, the placement agency, offers access to a group medical plan with monthly premiums of about $220 for a typical individual, though Mr. Gold remains on a Cobra plan courtesy of his previous permanent job. Through the agency, he is entitled to quarterly bonuses based on a percentage of earnings and a 401(k) plan.
Yet beyond issues of benefits and salary, Mr. Gold is trapped in a fluorescent netherworld of impermanence. "I definitely feel a little extra sort of cattle prod" to be energetic in his job, he said, "because I know how easy it would be for them to say, 'Why are we paying you all this money?' " 
While he does as good a job as anyone in the company, "You sort of feel like your competency is being called into question a little more often," he said. "But it's the nature of the beast."
Then there is the temp world's strangely elusive sense of being there but not really being there.
"There are certain places you go and they treat you like the cleaning lady who's a friend of the family, but really isn't part of the family," Mr. Gold said. "That's why I want a full-time job." 

Prepare to Be Ignored
THE world of the temporary office worker has its own subculture. For the clerks, receptionists and other relatively low-paid workers who make up the vast majority of temps, it can be a place of mind-numbing boredom, invisibility and dispensability. But temps now have a place to gather, commiserate and share advice: the Internet.
"Be prepared to be ignored," reads a cardinal rule from www.tempnyc.com, one of several Web sites aimed at temp workers. The site teaches temps how to cover their tracks while surfing the Internet and offers other tips, like eating the limit and stocking up on drinks if a company pays for meals or maintaining a simple mix-and-match wardrobe. 
"I personally wore the same tie at one job for four months straight," the advice giver wrote. "No one said a word. Remember, you are invisible. "
Another site, www.temp24-7 .com, offers Temp Tales of Terror and Gripe of the Week. The Administrative Resources Network Web site, www.adresnet.com, aimed at administrative assistants, has a temp section that offers advice in dealing with agencies. They can advertise interesting, but actually unavailable, jobs to build up a staff list, the site warns, and can shunt overqualified clients off to jobs that are beneath them. They can also offer full benefits but make it difficult to receive them. DANIEL J. WAKIN

HEADLINE: Luring the Best in an Unsettled Time 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
FOR much of the last century, employment in America rested on an exchange that contemplated far more than a day's wages for a day's work: it was all about a bundle of unspoken long-term commitments. Employees gave companies their loyalty -- however grudgingly -- in return for training, promotions, steady raises, job security and identity. 
 Smirk all you like about the Organization Man; his trade-off made possible the 30-year mortgages and college educations that the great American dream was historically made of. In its day, the pact could reinforce itself for a lifetime, for the higher one climbed in a company, the greater the rewards and the stronger the incentive to stick around and try for more. 
 Eight million layoffs later, the old understanding is dead. Interred with it is much of the conventional wisdom on retaining and motivating the American worker. 
Companies are now searching urgently for new ways to foster old-fashioned loyalty and commitment. A number of influential corporations are experimenting with a concept called "employer of choice." Part public relations campaign, part human resources experiment, it seeks to assure employees that no other workplace suits them better. 
These companies have an uphill battle. Demoralized by downsizings, outsourcings, restructurings and "rightsizings" -- dislocations summed up in the grim quip "the race to the bottom," today's employees have little institutional loyalty left to give. When headhunters call, they are very likely to answer. One recent survey found that nearly half of managers over 35 speak with headhunters at least quarterly.
Companies are not eager to train or groom people anymore; why invest in someone who might jump ship? Tempting benefits packages cannot easily be assembled to keep the restless in place, for shareholders remain beady-eyed about labor costs. The aggregate level of employee benefits has actually fallen over the last five years, as companies have pared health and retirement plans.
But even as America's nine-year economic expansion sputters, and fears of recession abound, companies will continue to fight the "war for talent." Demographers say that if growth slows, retirement-age baby boomers will begin leaving the labor pool. Somehow, managers will have to recruit and retain good performers, reduce turnover and promote a semblance of the institutional loyalty lost amid the turmoil of the last two decades.
So, the questions remain: How to inspire excellence in an age of impermanence? Is it possible to fight the talent war as you are running the race to the bottom? 
The promise of employer-of-choice campaigns may provide some answers.
The phenomenon sometimes goes by other names, like "best employers," "preferred employers" and "great places to work." There are no agreed-upon standards for an employer of choice to meet, no single surefire route. But behind the efforts is the same concept: branding. Position your workplace in the labor market, as you have positioned your products in the supermarket. Know your customers. Convince them you are different. Build brand loyalty. 
High-profile companies with workplace branding initiatives -- including the Prudential Insurance Company of America, Cingular Wireless and the CNA Financial Corporation -- seek to identify traits of model employees, figure out what these people want in a job and see to it that these people think they will find it more reliably at their company than anywhere else.
"There are considerable risks" in presenting yourself as an employer of choice, said Martin G. McGuinn, the chairman and chief executive of the Mellon Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh, which introducedsuch a campaign last year. 
What if your branding efforts land you a coveted berth on a popular magazine's "best employers" list, only to set indignant employees screaming false advertising? That's what happened to Merrill Lynch. After it made Working Woman magazine's best-companies list in 2000, a group of female stockbrokers who had sued Merrill Lynch & Company for sex discrimination mounted a letter-writing campaign to have the company's name removed. The women have hired light airplanes with banners to spread their message at sporting events and are sending a delegation to Merrill Lynch's next shareholders' meeting.
A Merrill Lynch spokesman said that while the company had not reached settlements with all the women, its managers thought they had corrected the workplace practices that had prompted the lawsuit.
In the same way, Verizon (in its pre-merger days, Bell South and GTE Corporation) landed on Working Woman's list of "best companies for working mothers" not long after employees had struck over the company's decidedly family-unfriendly use of mandatory overtime and other issues. A Verizon spokeswoman said the list's publication soon after the strike was an unfortunate coincidence, but that Verizon thinks the magazine's selection methods are valid and will try for a spot on this year's list.
Mr. McGuinn of Mellon said some of the bank's corporate customers had told him they considered undertaking employer-of-choice campaigns, but decided the risks were too great. "They said, 'If we couldn't do it, we'd be in even worse shape,' " he said. "The way we've tried to manage that risk is to be very upfront with our employees," that it would take time to become an employer of choice. 
"We had to make clear that it was a reciprocal commitment, too," he added. "We were going to invest in our employees, but they had to commit to the company."
THAT is the trick: winning the employees' sense of old-fashioned commitment without locking your company into the old-fashioned employment arrangement. Compensation experts say the last generation's weapons for fighting the war for talent -- gold-plated pension plans, health insurance that covered every dollar, seniority-based compensation schemes -- are nonstarters today.
"Companies can't predict what the market will look like or what their competitors will do, and they don't know where technology is leading," said Robert B. Reich, the former Secretary of Labor and the author of "The Future of Success," a new book on how the technology-led expansion is changing the structure of work. In this business environment, he said, "Companies want to maintain flexibility."
"They seek to eliminate all fixed costs," he went on. "And the biggest fixed cost of all, of course, is the payroll."
Companies can prune fixed costs gently or brutally, said Peter Capelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, but they cannot sit back and leave them in place. Mr. Capelli, who wrote "The New Deal at Work," views the forces that are dictating the conversion from fixed to variable labor costs as more powerful than even the most strong-willed chief executive.
What are these forces? Burgeoning imports, for one. The share of imported goods in the nation's product markets has soared in the last two decades. American manufacturers compete with foreign producers who do not come close to paying the United States minimum wage -- forget about comprehensive health insurance. 
There is also technological advancement, which has offered many new ways to monitor employees and suppliers, thus eliminating the need for numerous supervisors and middle managers. And there has been the boom years' stream of mergers and acquisitions, which have demanded ever-improving financial returns from the participating companies. The leveraged buyout craze of the late 1980's particularly demanded big gains, because the acquired companies had huge debts to service. Although leveraged buyouts have gone out of fashion, garden-variety mergers continue, as does the need for performance gains. "Where do the performance gains come from?" Mr. Capelli asked. Often, from breaking long-term employment relationships. "Because labor accounts for the vast majority of operating costs," he said, "even small savings in labor costs translate into large improvements in financial performance." 
Understanding these forces helps explain why just 1 percent of large American employers still offer defined-benefit pensions as their workers' sole sustenance in retirement, while more than a third have replaced those vehicles with 401(k)'s and other programs that transfer most risk and responsibility to employees. Understanding the dynamic sheds light on the replacement of conventional health coverage with managed-care programs, and the recent initiatives to supplement, or replace, pay with stock options.
But Mr. Capelli has spotted companies cutting fixed labor costs in other, unexpected places. Like corporate real estate: 10 years ago, the typical office offered an employee 250 square feet of space, he said. Today, the average is 200 square feet, while some employers are squashing workers into 100 square feet apiece. "Hoteling," the practice of shuffling permanent employees around a network of temporary offices, is another effort to reduce the fixed costs that work spaces represent. 
Even architecture holds lessons for those willing to read meaning in glass and steel, Mr. Capelli said. Company buildings are much lower these days, because so many layers of management have been cut from the flow chart, there is little need for towering edifices. Who would stick around for the long climb to the corner suite?
SUPPOSE your company considers these trends and concludes that its best hope lies in workplace branding. Extensive employer-of-choice initiatives can involve the art and reach of a $50 million advertising campaign. 
Focus groups must be assembled and former employees must be located and quizzed on why they left. Those who remain must be polled on what they really want -- but polled carefully, lest they think they will get what they ask for. "Benchmarking" surveys must be carried out to see where a company's pay-and-benefits structure falls short of the competition's. 
Benchmarking can turn up all kinds of errors, consultants say. Mr. McGuinn of Mellon said the benchmarking for the bank showed that it was underpaying salaried employees, and would have to give thousands of people raises worth "multiple millions of dollars" if it was to have credibility as an employer of choice.
"When you increase salaries, that's a fixed cost that goes on and on," he said. The raises were granted anyway.
But benchmarking can mean good news for other companies. At Prudential, the big insurer in New Jersey, comparisons prepared by the Segal Company, a benefits consultancy in New York, showed that the Prudential was overshooting its competition on dental benefits. The coverage was so out of whack that the company could scale back without angering employees.
"Surprisingly, to be the employer of choice, you don't need to give the employees everything they want," said Rick Wald, a principal in the Minneapolis office of the human-resources consulting firm William M. Mercer. "You need to give them more than the competition is giving."
Next, employer-of-choice candidates must identify their companies' special qualities and express them in a few choice phrases. The chief executive must then persuade skeptical employees that the slogans are real.
Typically, new in-house images are spun to match the face the companies show to the world. Southwest Airlines, whose regnant advertising bit is "the freedom to fly," wrote an employee "promise line" last year: "Freedom begins with me." 
With that bright assertion came a list of eight new employee "freedoms" -- "the freedom to create financial security," for instance, "the freedom to make a positive difference" and "the freedom to work hard and play hard." Never does Southwest's list mention the word "pay." 
The thinking here is to soar above other employers, while imbuing workers with the subliminal message that their interests coincide with the customers' interests. 
Cingular Wireless, a new joint venture of BellSouth Corporation and SBC Communications, plans to create an image around "enhancing the consumer experience," so its internal slogans imply that employees' workplace experiences will be enhanced in the same way, said Rickford Bradley, the senior vice president for human resources at Cingular. "We want customers to use the wireless device as a tool to express themselves," he said. "We want to give our employees the opportunity to be just as expressive."
To reinforce these messages, employer-of-choice contenders must assemble a menu of what are sometimes called "relational" or "environmental" employee benefits. "Traditionally, companies competed by leading the competition, but now employers are focusing on the mix" of benefits, said George T. Milkovich, the Martin P. Catherwood professor of human resource management at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University. "They believe it signals certain kinds of employees and makes them the employer of choice."
Thus a company that looks at its work force and sees many time-pressed men and women from dual-earner families may offer relational benefits that convey family friendliness. Prudential, for instance, offers two on-site day care centers, several backup day care centers, two extra weeks of paid family leave and "daddy stress" workshops. Prudential also recently announced that employees could scale back to part-time schedules without losing benefits. In addition, it is testing concierge services to perform employees' personal chores. 
Cingular, by contrast, is trying to appeal to a work force that is overwhelmingly young and mobile; it expects the average worker to stay with the company two years.
Cingular is branding itself as an innovative, hip workplace with the style of the dot-com world but none of the dot-coms' propensity to implode. Cingular's relational benefits focus on freedom, informality and personal-growth opportunities: pizza days, casual dress, tuition reimbursement plans.
The work force at the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb consists largely of parents and parents-to-be who stay with the company an average of 10 years, said Charles G. Tharp, the senior vice president for human resources. "These are people who are thinking about pensions," he said. So the company includes a 401(k) program and a traditional defined-benefit pension plan in its benefits. 
Many of these benefits can be provided by outside vendors, allowing employers to create brand images without incurring fixed labor costs, said Paul E. Platten, a national practice leader for strategic rewards at Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm in Washington.
"The holy grail for a lot of human resources consultants is to help companies lower their cost of transaction," Mr. Platten said. A company that spent, say, $80 million a year administering pay and benefits in the past might now pare $20 million from its fixed costs by outsourcing those functions. "That's $20 million that falls right through to your bottom line," he said.
COMPANIES may like the sound of that. They may also deplore high turnover and long to keep their best employees. But most do not think that the employer-of-choice approach will work. A recent study of 7,000 corporate officers and managers by McKinsey & Company, a consultancy in New York, found that only 7 percent of managers thought their companies had enough talent to pursue the most promising business opportunities -- yet only 7 percent said they were updating their recruiting and retention strategies.
"There's a lot of people who think the 'best employer' thing is nothing but a big giveaway program," said Gary Mitchiner, a consultant for Hewett Associates, a management consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. "There's a lot of cynicism: 'It's fluff. It's a beauty contest.' "
Mr. Mitchiner recently tried to pitch his firm's services to a utility. "They said: 'Come on! We're pumping natural gas here, and it's the same natural gas for everybody,' " he recalled. At a presentation to a major airline's executives, he was rebuffed with the argument that passengers care foremost about the route network, not about being served by a happy, committed work force. "They said the only people that are really valuable to them are the ones with licenses, and everybody else is just completely interchangeable," Mr. Mitchiner said. "And they're not being flip. They really believe it."
Human-resources consultants find such thinking hard to understand. "If a company buys a new machine, the first thing a manager will think is: 'How do I get the most out of this machine? How do I repair it? What maintenance schedule do I set up if I want to get a certain return?' " Mr. Platten said. "But people are looked at as a necessary evil," instead of as an investment.
One company's experience in offering anattractive benefit -- the four-day workweek -- to a small group of employees may help explain the doubts that many managers harbor concerning employer of choice. Although the experiment was a success, the company did not adopt the shorter week in every department.
PNC Financial Services Group, a large bank, recently moved its deposit-support department from downtown Philadelphia to a building in the suburbs. The change threw the 31 employees' lives into chaos. People were commuting as much as two and a half hours each way. Morale plunged in the department, which prepares paperwork for United States savings bonds, mortgage approvals and other financial processes.
PNC asked the department's supervisor, Ruth Farlee, what could be done. Ms. Farlee did not think a four-day workweek would be feasible, but she was willing to try because she was also fighting traffic four hours each day. 
PNC gave Ms. Farlee free rein to design a shorter week; it took her six months. Because she was not authorized to hire new people or to pay overtime, she had to make sure the same number of people would complete the same amount of work in the same total hours a week. She also cross-trained everybody to backstop one another. 
Next, Ms. Farlee put her department through a six-month tryout, explaining that if the four-day workweek failed, it would be abandoned. At the end of the trial, she interviewed each staff member privately.
"I got such positive feedback that I was shocked," Ms. Farlee said. Morale was up. Turnover had fallen to zero. Many employees boasted perfect attendance records.
Better yet, productivity was up. Though no one had expected it, the 10-hour, four-day workweek was better suited than the five-day week to the tasks the department performed. The best gains were on mortgage approvals: processing time dropped from eight days to three.
This may sound like the makings of an employer-of-choice campaign. But PNC is not about to roll out the four-day workweek companywide, wait for productivity gains and, on that base, build an internal brand. 
Kathleen D'Appolonia, the vice president for work-life and diversity at PNC, said she believed that the department's experience held a different lesson: the decisive factor in shaping a working environment is the work itself, not the goals of company branding. Some jobs might lend themselves to restructuring, she said, but not all, and seasoned managers are likelier than branding consultants to know which are which. 
The four-day workweek succeeded in the deposit-support department because of the nature of the work, she said, and because the supervisor, Ms. Farlee, was a 33-year bank veteran who understood the department's duties and had the trust and support of her subordinates.
Ms. Farlee has now moved on to PNC's A.T.M. card operations department, where she has been given the latitude to introduce another four-day workweek. Even if she succeeds, her efforts will have little immediate effect on the rest of the company's 26,000 employees. "People are dying for some degree of flexibility and the ability to manage their personal lives and their work lives effectively," Ms. D'Appolonia said. "But I'm not sure the answer is the compressed workweek. It depends on the nature of the business."

Money Isn't Everything
WHAT do employees want most in a job? 
Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm in Washington, asked a variety of employees who were top performers in their fields to rank the importance of pay, benefits and 13 other workplace attributes. (Some of the categories of employees interviewed included clerical workers, professional-technical, managers and people who earned more than $100,000 a year.) The results showed that men valued compensation above all else, while women put employee benefits first. Compensation was third on the women's list, after opportunities to develop their skills.
Professionals in the survey valued skill-development opportunities the most, while clerical workers cared little about them; they wanted employee benefits and job security. 
Those who earned more than $100,000 a year ranked compensation first; people earning less than $30,000 yearned, above all, for job security.
Every group that was surveyed placed some importance on benefits -- except the under-30's, who did not even rank benefits among their top five concerns. The young workers' hit parade: opportunities to develop skills; chances for promotion; compensation; vacations; and having an appealing culture and colleagues.
In another poll, Randstad North America, an employment consulting firm in Atlanta, asked employees which "hard benefits" and "soft" workplace factors would be most decisive in making a stay-or-leave decision. 
The survey, which did not break out respondents by demographics or by profession, found that health insurance was by far the most valued hard benefit, ranking significantly ahead of pay. Those who were polled attached relatively little importance to market- and performance-linked benefits like stock options, profit sharing or "creative incentives." 
As for a company's soft attributes, the factor cited most often by respondents was whether they liked the people with whom they worked. A "pleasant work environment" and an easy commute tied for second place. 
In yet another poll, the National Association of Colleges and Employers asked 1,218 college seniors entering the work force to rank the importance of 20 benefits. Again, health insurance was the winner, followed by 401(K) plans, annual raises, life insurance, dental insurance and pension plans. 
Day care centers ranked 19th out of 20, not surprising because the respondents were unlikely to have children. But also near the bottom were several perks that companies use to court young workers: casual-dress policies, on-site fitness centers and social activities.

 BODY:
FAST FOOD NATION
The Dark Side of the All-American Meal
By Eric Schlosser
Illustrated. 356 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $25.
 Eric Schlosser's compelling new book, "Fast Food Nation," will not only make you think twice before eating your next hamburger, but it will also make you think about the fallout that the fast food industry has had on America's social and cultural landscape: how it has affected everything from ranching and farming to diets and health, from marketing and labor practices to larger economic trends. 
 As the subtitle of his book, "The Dark Side of the All-American Meal," clearly indicates, Mr. Schlosser is not sanguine about the consequences of the fast food business. 
He argues that "the centralized purchasing decisions of the large restaurant chains and their demand for standardized products have given a handful of corporations an unprecedented degree of power over the nation's food supply," and that as "the basic thinking behind fast food has become the operating system of today's retail economy," small businesses have been marginalized and regional differences smoothed over. A deadening homogenization, he writes, has been injected into the country and increasingly the world at large.
Mr. Schlosser, a correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, draws on earlier works like Jim Hightower's "Eat Your Heart Out," Stan Luxenberg's "Roadside Empires," Robert L. Emerson's "New Economics of Fast Food," and "Big Mac: The Unauthorized Story of McDonald's" by Max Boas and Steve Chain. He has also done a lot of legwork, interviewing dozens of fast food workers, farmers, ranchers and meatpackers in an effort to trace the snowballing effect that fast-food production methods have had on their work.
The resulting book, which began as a two-part article in Rolling Stone magazine, is not a dispassionate examination of the subject but a fierce indictment of the fast food industry. Mr. Schlosser contends that "the profits of the fast food chains have been made possible by losses imposed on the rest of society," including a rising obesity rate and an increase in foodborne illnesses (most notably, those caused by the E. coli O157:H7 bacteria, whose spread has been facilitated by the growing centralization of the meat production process).
He argues that "since the administration of President Richard Nixon, the fast food industry has worked closely with its allies in Congress and the White House to oppose new worker safety, food safety and minimum wage laws." He urges the government to ban advertising aimed at children, to "create a single food safety agency that has sufficient authority to protect the public health" and to stop subsidizing the sort of dead-end jobs generated by the fast food business.
On occasion, Mr. Schlosser undermines the substantive points he wants to make by seeming eager to blame that industry for virtually every contemporary ill. Talking about restaurant robberies, he writes that "crime and fast food have become so ubiquitous in American society that their frequent combination usually goes unnoticed." Talking about teenagers who take jobs after school to buy a car, he complains that "as more and more kids work to get their own wheels, fewer participate in after-school sports and activities"; "they stay at their jobs late into the night, neglect their homework and come to school exhausted." 
Despite such melodramatic lapses, "Fast Food Nation" provides the reader with a vivid sense of how fast food has permeated contemporary life and a fascinating (and sometimes grisly) account of the process whereby cattle and potatoes are transformed into the burgers and fries served up by local fast food franchises. It's an account that includes an unnerving description of the dangerous, injury-filled work performed in slaughterhouses, where job assignments have names like "first legger, knuckle dropper, navel boner" and an equally absorbing description of how the New Jersey-based "flavor industry" tries to make processed frozen food palatable by manipulating taste, aroma and "mouthfeel." 
What is perhaps most astonishing about America's fast food business is just how successful it has been: what began in the 1940's as a handful of hot dog and hamburger stands in Southern California has spread, like kudzu, across the land to become a $110 billion industry. According to Mr. Schlosser, Americans now spend more on fast food than they spend on higher education, personal computers, computer software or new cars, or on movies, books, magazines, newspapers, videos and recorded music combined.
Mr. Schlosser writes that "on any given day in the United States about one-quarter of the adult population visits a fast food restaurant" and that "the typical American now consumes approximately three hamburgers and four orders of French fries every week." "An estimated one of every eight workers in the United States has at some point been employed by McDonald's," he adds, and "the company annually hires about one million people, more than any other American organization, public or private."
As fast food franchises from McDonald's to Pizza Hut to Kentucky Fried Chicken go global, this dynamic has assumed an international flavor. In Brazil, Mr. Schlosser reports, McDonald's has already become the nation's largest private employer. Classes at McDonald's Hamburger University in Oak Park, Ill., are now taught in 20 different languages, and a Chinese anthropologist notes that all the children at a primary school in Beijing recognized an image of Ronald McDonald. For the Chinese, the anthropologist noted, McDonald's represents "Americana and the promise of modernization."

HEADLINE: A Legal Tender of One's Own 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: GUARDIAGRELE, Italy 

 BODY:
Later this year Europe will begin distributing the coins and bills of its new currency, the euro. But this hilltop hamlet of 10,000, huddled beneath snow-dusted peaks and in sight of the Adriatic Sea, is a step ahead.
 Last summer, a restless retired law professor whose family has been among the local notables for centuries, Giacinto Auriti, realized a decades-old dream of deposing the Italian central bank from its money-printing monopoly by printing and distributing a local currency called the simec. 
 Professor Auriti, 77, a jovial man who quotes freely -- in Italian -- George Bernard Shaw, Ezra Pound and the New Testament, has eccentric theories about the evils of central banks, and has even sued several central bank presidents for fraud, so far unsuccessfully. 
"Between me and the central banks there is a mortal struggle," he said, over roast lamb at a local restaurant. "There is no middle way."
Though his final goal is for the simec to become a global currency, supplanting monies around the world including the euro, for the moment his simec is the coin of a narrow realm. In that sense, it is like the local currencies that have been introduced in about 60 communities in the United States since an environmentalist, Paul Glover, introduced "Ithaca Hours" in upstate New York in 1993 to bolster local business and keep wealth in local hands.
To be sure, the simec, an Italian abbreviation for "econometric symbol," ignited a frenzy of shopping here when it was issued last year, cheering local officials who were casting about for ways to supplement traditional businesses like shoemaking and wrought iron. But it also divided local merchants and provoked a raid by the Italian financial police, who impounded boxloads of simecs until a court ordered them returned. It also made some people wonder if Professor Auriti were not some kind of monetary Pied Piper leading the locals astray.
It all began last July, when Professor Auriti, whose family has been wealthy landowners hereabouts for generations, had simecs printed at his own expense, then distributed them from his palazzo in exchange for Italian lire. He persuaded about 40 local merchants to honor them, promising to redeem each simec for two lire.
Achille Pica, a haberdasher on the main square, described the effect as electric. "In one day," he said, after the introduction of the simec, "I did the business of one month." At a redemption rate of two-to-one, Mr. Pica's shirts, suits and topcoats went for half price. About once a week, he and other merchants hauled their simecs to Professor Auriti's palazzo where they were exchanged for lire. Others, like Roberto Sciarretta, who runs a clothing store on the edge of town, said they used simecs to buy shoes or jewelry.
By mid-August, the professor reckons, about 2 billion simecs, worth $1.9 million at the professor's exchange rate, were in circulation. But the currency's rapid spread unsettled local officials, who ordered the financial police to impound the simecs in circulation. However, a court in Chieti, the provincial capital, soon restored them, arguing that Italian law proscribed counterfeiting the national currency but not printing money of one's own. An appeal is pending.
Today, Professor Auriti estimates that about 700 million simecs are in circulation, though he says, without elaborating, that they have created liquidity worth 10 billion lire.
Like most food sellers here, Gabriele Zulli, a butcher, does not accept simecs. What with Europe's mad cow scare, which has contributed to a 60 percent drop in his beef sales, he has enough problems, he said. The simec, he added, is accepted mainly by clothing stores, shoe stores and jewelers, and he says some of them use the simec to clear out inventory, often raising prices first to make the discount seem greater. "Basically, it's all just business," he said.
Franco Caramanico, a former engineer who has been mayor since 1997, is an unabashed admirer of Professor Auriti. "He's a person who believes in his ideals, and not only believes, but puts his fortune behind it," Mr. Caramanico said in his office in a disused Franciscan monastery.
Mr. Caramanico recently paid for a pair of shoes with simecs; his wife always carries some in her wallet, alongside lire.
The danger of course, as with every currency, is inflation, and that could become acute if Professor Auriti carries out two other corollaries of his theory. One is that cash should be distributed freely, and not lent through the banking system at interest, as nefarious central bankers do, so he wants to begin doling out regular payments of simecs to families.
Moreover, he detests tax collectors almost as much as he does central bankers, so he recently promised to compensate taxpayers with simecs.
For Mayor Caramanico, confidence in the simec is at risk. Professor Auriti is not legally bound to redeem simecs for lire and, if there were a run and the simec could not be redeemed for lire, some in Guardiagrele could get burned, he fears. "The basis of it all is trust," he said. "If there is trust and the simec is accepted -- fine. If not, there are risks."
In his haberdashery, Mr. Pica still uses simecs to clear inventory. In his after-Christmas sales this week, he was offering $57 shirts for full payment in simecs, though leather topcoats tagged at $490 were offered at half price, with full payment required in lire. These days, Mr. Pica usually accepts payment of half the purchase price in lire and half in simecs. Recently, when he sought to redeem simecs for lire, he was turned down.
Yet, the advantages to accepting simecs far outweigh the risks, he claims. The simec attracts customers and increases business, he says, more than offsetting any losses that would accrue if he were some day forced to write off the value of the simecs in his till. "It's a calculated loss," he said.

HEADLINE: Hunting for Oil: New Precision, Less Pollution 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE 

 BODY:
In the midwinter gloom of Alaska's Arctic, the annual rush is on to probe the North Slope for undiscovered pockets of oil. 
 The ritual always starts like a horse race, when state officials declare the region open for "tundra travel." This year the declaration came on Jan. 10. It meant the normally fragile peat bogs, shallow ponds and lichen-tufted ridges were frozen as solid as a tabletop. 
 Now the seismic-mapping, road-building and well-drilling teams are fanning out across the windblown vastness of the country's farthest shore. 
Although the rhythm of the work has been the same for years, the effort bears little resemblance to the early days of the Alaskan oil rush, when the first finds at Prudhoe Bay in 1968 led to the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and opened the country's last big terrestrial oil frontier. 
Back then, thousands of tons of gravel were scooped from riverbeds and spread far and wide on the peat to make roads and drilling pads. Exploration wells sprouted across the treeless plain. Waste pits overflowed with drilling mud, contaminated water, spilled oil and discarded chemicals. A spreading web of pipelines connected everything and sent the resulting black bounty south toward civilization over the Brooks Range. Grizzly bears and Arctic foxes learned the art of Dumpster diving.
But over the last decade, the quest for Arctic oil has quietly, and almost completely, changed. 
By any measure, oil drilling is still far from a green industry, but advances in computing and exploration methods, new techniques that allow dispersed underground targets to be reached from a single drilling site and different waste disposal practices have greatly reduced the environmental damage from a modern-day oil patch, according to a wide array of government and industry officials.
Supercomputer simulations of the deep earth are raising success rates, cutting the need to bore extra wells. New sensor-studded drills can steer through rock, sand and salt layers in three dimensions, following thin layers containing oil. 
Wells are now constructed in tight ranks on small gravel pads, branching out underground instead of peppering the surface over a broad area. 
Waste, garbage and cuttings of rock are ground into a slurry and pumped into sediment layers 2,000 feet beneath the 2,000-foot-thick permafrost. Roads once built of gravel are now often built of ice and melt away in the spring thaw, leaving few traces on the spongy ground.
The only feature that remains essentially the same is the maze of pipelines, which are an unavoidable instrument for collecting the liquid fuel and sending it to markets. Even there, though, there have been changes. Many newer North Slope pipelines are elevated to allow caribou to duck underneath on annual treks to calving grounds and are punctuated by elevated elbows so that if one section is punctured, only the oil between the elbows gushes onto the tundra. The changes are being highlighted by the oil industry, Alaskan elected officials and the Bush administration as evidence that the oil quest should be allowed to expand east from Prudhoe Bay into the last untrammeled slice of the American Arctic, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Companies had already gained permission from the Clinton administration to push west from Prudhoe Bay into the Alaskan National Petroleum Reserve, a vast, barren area that was set aside for future oil drilling by the federal government in 1923. That region includes several lakes that are visited by an extraordinary array of migratory birds, and the area around one of the lakes is seen as a prime oil prospect by the companies.
The petroleum reserve is where many of this winter's seismic expeditions are methodically thumping the frozen ground seeking promising echoes.
With the recent spike in oil and natural gas prices, companies and the Bush administration now see the best chance to expand both west and east. 
Last April, at a hearing of the House Committee on Resources -- arranged by its chairman, Don Young, Republican of Alaska -- Joseph H. Hegna, a veteran environmental manager for ARCO Alaska, made his best pitch for more oil drilling, acknowledging the past but staunchly defending new standards.
"We've learned a lot over the years," Mr. Hegna said. "We can explore without leaving footprints. And the footprint required for new developments is a tenth of what it once was."
Critics and some environmental groups, while acknowledging improvements, say the oil quest always leaves scars, the innovations come with new risks, and -- most important -- once oil is found a wild landscape is permanently transformed.
A panel of scientists convened here earlier this month by the National Academy of Sciences heard from experts on both sides of the issue, some of whom said the advances in technology were essentially irrelevant to the question of drilling in the refuge. 
"We do not categorically oppose oil development," said Stanley E. Senner, the executive director of the Alaska office of the National Audubon Society. But he added that some empty wilderness needs to stay empty. "Our ultimate concern is that in 25 years we may see a spaghetti map of roads, pipelines and power lines spread willy-nilly across the North Slope," he said.
Pamela A. Miller, an environmental consultant in Anchorage who runs tundra tours and formerly studied the region for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, has more specific complaints. 
"There are impacts to wildlife habitats even from the best technology," she said, pointing out that some ice roads made with water pumped from tundra ponds have been found to contain a frozen fish here and there. 
And to build a half-foot-thick ice road requires 1 million to 1.5 million gallons of water per mile, according to the Bureau of Land Management.
Industry officials respond by saying that increasingly -- except where there is ample water in deep ponds, as is the case near Prudhoe -- the roads are not made by spraying water but are built with chipped ice scraped from ponds and laid down like gravel. 
The three-dimensional seismic technology that essentially performs ultrasound on the earth clearly is a mixed blessing, both industry and environmental critics say. 
Although seismic crews now conduct surveys with vibrating trucks instead of detonated dynamite, their convoys, despite wide, tanklike treads that are designed to spread the weight of 10-ton vehicles, still can leave persistent scars even when traveling on frozen ground.
These high-tech wagon trains -- often comprising 100 or more workers -- do not travel on ice roads, but instead crisscross the open tundra.
They cover vastly greater acreage than the older seismic method so they can provide the most precise data possible for the three-dimensional simulators back in Anchorage or Houston. 
The old-style surveys followed lines that were several miles apart, generating two-dimensional data that provided selected slices of the geology below. New seismic crews follow a tight weave of lines that are often just a few hundred feet apart, making it much more likely that they will encounter a herd of musk oxen or a polar bear den. 
Even some biologists working for oil companies concede this much more intensive level of winter activity could disrupt wildlife. 
"In the last four or five years, you've had two things going on at the same time -- 3-D seismic with its much tighter grid lines and musk oxen moving into some of these same areas," said Michael R. Joyce, a biologist who is a consultant for Phillips Petroleum. 
But he added that with proper planning and biologists conducting advance wildlife surveys, problems can be avoided.
In the meantime, there are significant environmental and economic advantages to the new seismic methods, which provide a vastly improved understanding of subterranean conditions. This is already greatly reducing the rate of "dry holes" -- wells that are drilled but come up empty, according to Energy Department officials. 
A decade ago, the norm was 1 producing well for each 10 exploratory wells drilled, according to the department. Now the rate is up to 5 good wells out of 10 drilled.
The fewer wells drilled, the smaller the impact on the landscape, said Michael J. Zeitlin, a former Texaco geologist who pioneered many of the computer simulation techniques that are spreading rapidly through the industry. Mr. Zeitlin is now the president of Magic Earth, a Houston company spun off by Texaco last year that operates an Imax-style theater in which geologists, with a mouse click, can move through a virtual Earth two miles under the North Slope, Texas or the Caspian Sea, examining possible "pay zones" from different angles and charting possible routes for wells.
"We're imaging the plumbing system of the earth," Mr. Zeitlin said. "We make maps and cross sections obsolete." 
The technology of getting a drill bit to all those precisely located pay zones has improved at almost the same pace. The brute-force mechanics of drilling still involves pumping high-pressure mud down the hole to spin the grinding faces of the drill bit. 
But now the bit can be steered precisely in three dimensions so that a well can plunge down through the permafrost and into rock, and then head horizontally for four or five miles, threading its way through oil-bearing zones along the way. 
This is the technology that has produced the reduction in the "footprint" of oil-drilling operations, allowing the well heads to be tightly clustered while the holes beneath them extract oil for tens of thousands of acres in every direction. 
New drills are studded with sensors that provide a steady stream of data on location, rock type, the presence of fluid, temperature and other conditions. That information is sent back to the surface coded in vibrations traveling through the stream of mud powering the drill.
Another type of drill, small enough to be transported on a truck, can be snaked down old vertical well holes and then bore sideways to harvest small pockets of oil, greatly increasing the life and productivity of those wells.
The field test for the latest technology is Phillips Petroleum's 40,000-acre Alpine oil field, which sits along the delta of the Colville River, wedged between the sprawling pipe-laced fields of Prudhoe Bay and the as-yet untapped National Petroleum Reserve. 
The Alpine field, which began producing oil two months ago, lies beneath a quilt of dozens of ponds and wetlands, so the wells to tap it were clustered on two drilling pads totaling about 93 acres, with no permanent road connecting the operation to the outside world.
Supplies and equipment come in along an ice road laid down each winter or are flown to an airstrip that is also the small road linking the two drilling pads.
To avoid both expense and environmental problems, the oil crosses under the Colville through a buried pipeline instead of running in a conventional pipe over it. 
It is the kind of development that some environmental groups see as acceptable -- at least outside the Arctic wildlife refuge. Deborah L. Williams, the executive director of the Alaska Conservation Foundation and a past special assistant to former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, has generally endorsed the Alpine field and also supports careful exploration in the petroleum reserve to the west -- but staunchly opposes any invasion of the refuge to the east.
"I drive a car and use petroleum products," she said. "We all have to be responsible and balanced." 
But, she said, despite all the advances and the shrinkage of the oil-patch footprint, pumping and processing oil will inevitably affect the areas where it is taking place. 
She cited a spill on Jan. 16 of about 20,000 gallons of drilling mud at BP Amoco's Northstar drilling site, which sits on an artificial island north of Prudhoe Bay. None of the mud flowed into the Beaufort Sea, but it showed that even the latest techniques are fallible, she said. 
Ms. Miller, the consultant in Anchorage, added that once work shifts from exploration to extraction of oil, the result is always a sprawl of pipelines and roads and crew quarters and fuel depots. 
"The one thing you can't get away from," she said, "is that in the end, even with all this technology, you've got a massive industrial complex."

HEADLINE: SHAKING THE MONEY TREE; 
Paying for Billion-Dollar Cultural Dreams

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
There may be arguments at Lincoln Center over whether its $1.5 billion redevelopment plan should include a new opera house, but there don't seem to be many over whether the $1.5 billion can be raised. Nor does there seem to be any uncertainty at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum over whether it can come up with the nearly $700 million needed for the bold new waterfront museum it is planning in Lower Manhattan.
 Ditto at the Museum of Modern Art, where a $650 million campaign is under way for an expansion that would nearly double its exhibition space and include new areas for education and research. Carnegie Hall is in the midst of a $50 million restoration that features a new basement theater, and officials there seem unfazed by a $20 million overrun. Nor is there any visible lack of financial confidence at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, which has started a construction effort that is ultimately expected to cost half a billion dollars. 
 There are plenty of other construction plans at the city's cultural institutions -- $50 million ones at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Joseph Papp Public Theater, a $24 million program at Symphony Space on the Upper West Side, a $15 million project at the Museum of Jewish Heritage (A Living Memorial to the Holocaust) in Battery Park City. And there is nary a public shudder when the price tags are mentioned.
Taken together, these building projects and additional ones by other institutions will cost more than $3 billion over the next decade if they are all carried out. And although the city, with its unprecedented budget surpluses, has been generous to several organizations, the great bulk of the money will have to be raised privately.
Does this make many of these grand plans little more than pipe dreams? Does it signal an emerging cultural slugfest over what, even on Park Avenue, is a limited pot of gold? Where is the money going to come from?
Each arts organization says that its plan was arrived at soberly and announced only after significant amounts of money were secured and the chances of fund-raising success were determined to be high, even in a wavering economy.
But $3 billion?
The aggregate sum and growing doubts about the stock market can't help but raise questions, most fundamentally about whether the city's philanthropists can support so many projects at one time.
The hunt for dollars also brings up deeper questions about the projects themselves. Raising money has become a full-time pursuit at many institutions, causing some donors and arts executives to wonder whether contributions are being solicited for legitimate needs or whether the needs are to some extent being created because the money is there. Institutions are also increasingly preoccupied with sustaining their big fund-raising operations and with attracting new millionaire board members before other institutions snag them; just about the best means for doing both is an ambitious, eye-catching project that happens to require lots of new money and new blood.
Regardless of the motivation for the projects, many experts say the money is likely to come. Robert Crane, president of the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, which supports several cultural institutions, suggested that most institutions already had their major allies sewn up. "These are going to be tough campaigns, but my guess is it won't be as much of a competition as one might expect," he said. 
His assessment reflects the prevailing wisdom. "There are key donors that people have in their corners," Mr. Crane said. "Most of these institutions have been raising substantial amounts of money one way or another for a period of years."
And fund-raisers say they are getting while the getting is good; there has never been a better time to raise money, recent economic upheaval notwithstanding.
"When there's money available, we say, 'We could get the money to do what we want to do; let's go for it, because it's there,' " said Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and chief executive of Bloomberg L.P., who serves on several boards. "Every dinner I'm the dinner chairman of, I find myself saying, 'Tonight, we broke a record.' "

Finding the Right Board Members
The goals set by the cultural institutions are lofty, but fund-raising experts say that even when taken cumulatively they are not pie in the sky. "Generally, a capital campaign is not announced until one-third to one-half of the money is secured," said Arlene Shuler, senior vice president for planning and external affairs at Lincoln Center. Other institutions also say they are assured of much of the money before they publicly start capital campaigns. 
Like a hospital or university, a cultural institution develops a core set of supporters it can count on for capital campaigns, as well as for annual giving. Crucial to this group are past supporters, subscribers and, above all, the institution's board members. 
Unlike the price in years past, today the price of admission to the board is often discussed up front. It can range from $5,000 a year to a middle range of $15,000 to $25,000; some contribute far more. Subsequent individual gifts from these board members can reach millions of dollars and can including naming rights, as for the Henry R. Kravis Wing for European Sculpture and Decorative Arts at the Met, a $51 million project to which Mr. Kravis contributed $10 million.
Generally, said E. John Rosenwald Jr., vice chairman of the museum and executive chairman of the Fund for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, an institution will get 90 percent of its contributions from 10 percent of its donors, almost always concentrated on the board. "It's all top-down loaded," he said.
Although artists and educators are still represented on boards, cultural institutions spend much of their energies trying to secure members with financial clout, people who often have a prominence that can attract donors from outside New York. 
"You get solicited by everybody; they've all got the same lists," said Irwin Schneiderman, a senior partner in the law firm of Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, who is chairman of the New York City Opera and serves on the board of Lincoln Center. The courtship dance is delicate because large donors generally like to concentrate their giving among a small number of causes. A board member at the Whitney Museum of American Art is not likely to become one at the Guggenheim as well.
Among the rich, there is an etiquette to apportioning time and money, insiders say. It is acceptable to commit to a large organization and a smaller one -- for example, the Met and the Dia Center for the Arts -- but not to two large ones like the Met and the Museum of Modern Art. It is also considered tasteful to give to large institutions in separate disciplines -- say, the Metropolitan Opera and the Whitney -- but not to large ones in the same discipline, like the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater.
Lincoln Center's board is an example of the fierce clout, monetary and otherwise, that accrues to numerous cultural boards in New York. It includes Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman and chief executive of IBM; Mr. Bloomberg; Harvey Golub, the retiring chairman of American Express; Richard D. Parsons, the co-chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner; and Robert A. Iger, the president and chief operating officer of the Walt Disney Company. Martin E. Segal, chairman emeritus at Lincoln Center, said the ideal board member could be characterized by the three W's: "wise, wealthy and willing."
Then there are some board members who are valued not for what they give but for what they get: they have a talent for drawing dollars out of other people. One arts contributor cited the socialite Blaine Trump as an example, given her effective fund-raising as a board member of American Ballet Theater and God's Love We Deliver.
While some board members join because of their personal passions -- a love of opera, for example -- others say the bond has been established by friends on the board, a family tradition or even just geography. 
"I got involved in the Met because I moved across the street from it," said Steven Rattner, the investment banker and former deputy chairman of Lazard Freres & Company.
Beyond the obligations of board membership, organizations offer plenty of inducements to giving. Naming rights rank high among them. Peter Norton, the software entrepreneur who is a board member of the Signature Theater Company, contributed $1 million to the group's new theater on West 42nd Street, now called the Peter Norton Space. A theater at Symphony Space, the performing arts center being renovated on Broadway at 95th Street, will also be named for a major donor -- the same Mr. Norton, who contributed $5 million. 
"Sometimes, for inexplicable reasons, I want to be high-profile," said Mr. Norton, who is on the Modern's board and supports the Guggenheim. "In other situations, I don't seek out any special recognition."
Money like Mr. Norton's, secured before fund-raising campaigns are even announced, is called a lead gift. These gifts are used to attract additional contributions, and the search for them, beyond being important for the moment, can also lead to long-term reward, so much so that it is referred to as "well drilling."

The Search for New Blood
"In the old days, institutions had capital campaigns every 20 years or so; now, campaigns don't end," said Mr. Rosenwald of the Met. "There's a constant pressure to drill new wells, to find new up-and-coming prosperous members of the community -- find out who they are, where they are." And that has helped generate the endless campaign.
Six years ago, for example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art started a $300 million campaign, which then rose to $400 million and is now at $650 million.
Mr. Rosenwald, the vice chairman of Bear, Stearns & Company, said that cultural institutions like the Met essentially have no choice but to make fund-raising a year-round enterprise. "You put together within your organization a fund-raising operation of professionals -- research people, analysts," he said. "And it would be fruitless to say, 'We've hit $400 million, let's fire everybody and, when we start the next campaign, hire everybody back.' "
Arts executives try to play down any rivalries, saying many donors are open to contributing to a variety of causes. "We're not an either-or community," said Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center.
Nevertheless, they acknowledge devoting considerable resources to identifying potential new donors. "You don't go to the Forbes 400 list and start calling," Mr. Rattner said. "There's a lot of serendipity. What we're all trying to do is figure out who the next generation is and try to get them before they get overcommitted."
The pitch can be blunt but high minded. Nancy Rabin, the former chairwoman of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy, a membership association of businesses that work with nonprofit organizations to help them improve fund-raising, has delivered this pitch many times. "It will be important to be counted someplace," she said. "If the city matters to you and you have the resources, someone should be able to reach out to you in a way that taps into your generosity. No one's going to be able to hide because everyone will be asking."
Toni K. Goodale, a fund-raising consultant for nonprofit organizations, said, "Everybody's after the young Wall Street guys and women who are not necessarily known to people, an untapped resource." Speaking of her organization, she said: "We know where the dollars are. They hire us to organize these capital campaigns and help them strategize and identify targets."
Jeffrey T. Leeds, 44, co-principal with William F. Weld, the former Massachusetts governor, in the equity firm of Leeds Weld & Company, is one of those targets. He said that, after being approached by about half a dozen other institutions, he agreed to join the board of the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum because he was impressed by the knowledge and commitment of its curators. "For me, it was about content," he said. 
Most institutions have created specific categories for a new generation of givers. The Metropolitan Museum has an Apollo Circle, for people 21 to 39, who can attend special events like an evening with the museum's director, Philippe de Montebello, curatorial tours, exhibition previews and mini-courses on collecting and connoisseurship. Annual dues for individuals and couples are $1,000, with two complimentary tickets for a summer celebration at the museum. This year's will be a sunset viewing of the exhibition "Joel Shapiro on the Roof" at the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden, and cocktails in the Carroll and Milton Petrie European Sculpture Court.
Lincoln Center Theater has a Young Patron Program "for theater lovers in their 20's or 30's" who have made donations from $250 to $1,000. In addition, the theater has categories for higher-rolling patrons with perks ranging from a pair of complimentary tickets and free drinks at intermission to highest-priority seating and reserved tables at opening night parties.

Extra Lure of Capital Projects
Arts executives say there is nothing quite like a capital campaign to galvanize fund-raising. Mr. Rosenwald said an institution could expect to raise twice what it would normally, without a campaign. In part, experts say, this is because the projects are concrete, ambitious and finite.
"You want to provide a menu for potential philanthropists," said Paul Beirne, a money manager who last fall was named chairman of the Alliance for the Arts, an arts advocacy group about to announce its own $10 million capital campaign. "There are some individuals and foundations that only want to give to bricks and mortar."
To pull off a capital campaign, fund-raising experts say, it is important for an institution first to determine responsibly that the intended projects are necessary and worthwhile and that the money is out there to finance them. 
"It's important for the morale of the people in the institutions not to fail, to be careful to set a goal that is achievable," said Emily Rafferty, the senior vice president for external affairs at the Metropolitan Museum. "Is the project precisely articulated, and are they projects that the institution and staff stand behind? Can the goals realistically be met so that donors are not disappointed?"
If campaigns have failed in the city, fund-raisers say, people usually do not hear about them precisely because by the time a capital effort becomes public, its success has been assured. In Paris, however, one such example of a plan gone bad is the American Center, the $41 million building designed by Frank O. Gehry. Inaugurated by Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1994, it was to become a hub of American artistic creativity. Instead, barely 19 months later, the center suspended its activities for lack of money and was put up for sale. 
"You should not build if you can't also raise the money to help operate," said Mr. Beirne, 39, who for several years was chairman of the Modern's junior associates committee and currently serves on the boards of the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, the World Monuments Fund and the Municipal Arts Society. 
This month, the Milwaukee Art Museum announced that completion of its $100 million expansion would be delayed so that the museum could broaden the project's scope and increase the budget. On another front, the Metropolitan Opera threw a wrench into Lincoln Center's renovation plans, pulling out on the grounds that it had not been sufficiently consulted. This leaves Ms. Sills and Marshall Rose, a real estate developer who is heading up the renovation, trying to mend fences even as they press ahead to come up with a master plan.
They are interviewing 10 of the center's 12 constituent groups -- all except Jazz at Lincoln Center, which is building its own $115 million home at Columbus Circle, and the Library for the Performing Arts, which just completed a $30 million renovation -- about their needs. Given the lofty financial goals, Lincoln Center executives are gearing up for the sales pitch of their careers.
Realizing the stakes, Ms. Sills and Mr. Rose said, it was important to them to wait until they had the master plan in hand so they could approach donors with something on paper or even three-dimensional. 
That plan is due to be finished by summer. Yet Ms. Sills said that, anxious about the sums involved, she was already unofficially soliciting support wherever possible. "At dinner parties, when I happen to hook on to someone who might have an interest, I talk about our needs," she said, "and try to pass on some of our own enthusiasm."

A Stubborn Question
Despite all the optimism, more than one person has posed a fundamental question: Is all this construction necessary? "Raising money can become an end in itself," said Mr. Leeds, the Cooper-Hewitt board member. "We run the risk of not asking the tough questions -- 'Do we need more space or are our facilities adequate?' Often, institutions come up with events or vehicles around which they can raise money; for example, an exhibition which may appeal to a corporate sponsor or a program which may attract a certain philanthropist with known interests."
"You run the risk of compromising the mission of these institutions," he added.
Why does the city need another Guggenheim, when it has one already? What's wrong with Carnegie Hall the way it is? And didn't the New York Botanical Garden just finish a major renovation?
Felix G. Rohatyn, who recently returned to New York from a stint as United States ambassador to France and serves on the board of Carnegie Hall, said that the improvement of those institutions was important to the city's culture industry. "Culture is such a huge business and is such an attraction for tourists that a lot of this can be justified in terms of the city's economy," he said.
Experienced fund-raisers say the philanthropic community is in something of a wait-and-see mode, given the stock market's softening and potential changes in tax law that would affect charitable giving. "If there was a major downturn in the economy," said Mr. Crane of the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, "each of the campaigns would be set back."
Still, fund-raisers like Ms. Sills are upbeat and undaunted. "There's always been enough money to go around," she said.

 CORRECTION:
An article and a chart yesterday listing fund-raising efforts by cultural institutions in New York misstated the cost of the expansion planned for the Museum of Jewish Heritage. It is $60 million, not $15 million.
The article also misspelled the surname of a fund-raising consultant who is a former chairwoman of the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy at the American Association of Fundraising Counsel. She is Nancy L. Raybin, not Rabin.

HEADLINE: Union Carbide Reports a Loss 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Union Carbide Corporation posted a fourth-quarter loss yesterday, citing the slowing economy and the high costs of energy and raw materials.
 The company, which has agreed to be acquired by Dow Chemical, said it lost $94 million, or 70 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $94 million, or 68 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 Excluding a charge of $31 million, or 17 cents a share, related to a partnership with Honeywell International Inc., the company said it lost 53 cents a share.
Analysts had expected the company to lose 53 cents after they lowered their estimates earlier this month when Union Carbide issued an earnings warning, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Before the warning, Wall Street had been expecting a more modest loss of 20 cents a share.
Revenue rose to $1.6 billion from $1.55 billion.
Shares of Union Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., fell 17 cents, to $48.45.
Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Dow are waiting for regulatory approval for their merger, which they had hoped to close by this time a year ago.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rise as Investors Anticipate Effects of a Rate Cut

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday as investors bet that a widely expected cut in interest rates this week would bolster battered technology shares and shrugged off a sobering outlook from the computer networking powerhouse Cisco Systems Inc.
 "There is a persistent pattern of buying on weakness," said Barry Hyman, chief market strategist at Weatherly Securities. "The market is showing this ability to continually shy away from the negative news stories like Cisco today." 
 Late buying of personal computer makers like Dell Computer and communications issues like Qualcomm helped the Nasdaq composite index finish up 57.04 points, or 2.1 percent, at 2,838.34. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 42.21 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,702.19, helped by interest-rate-sensitive financial shares. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 9.22 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,364.17.
Early yesterday, the Dow felt the pull of AT&T after it posted a 51 percent slump in profits stemming from strong competition and falling long-distance prices. The company warned that consumer revenues would continue to shrink. But its stock rebounded in the afternoon, closing up 50 cents at $23.81.
"The glass is half full," said Uri Landesman, chief investment officer for AFA Management Partners L.P. in Greenwich, Conn., which has $300 million under management.
"The Fed is in an easing cycle, it should be, to restimulate the economy," he said, "and stocks have always done well in Fed-easing cycles over the last 50 years. I don't think that this time will be any different."
The Federal Reserve, faced with a slowing economy, is expected to lower the federal funds rate by half a percentage point for the second time this month at its policy-setting meeting today and tomorrow.
Cisco fell $1.13, to $37.25, after its chief executive, John Chambers, said the current fiscal quarter looked more challenging than a few weeks ago amid the economic slowdown.
But among the PC makers, Dell rose $1.94, to $28.44, and Apple Computer gained $2.13, to $21.69. The wireless technology company Qualcomm climbed $5.81, to $86.81. The chip maker Intel advanced $1.19, to $37.06, and the network computer maker Sun Microsystems shot up $2.38, to $33.56.
"Clearly the fundamental situation and the inventory concerns are real and not going to turn around right away, but there's a huge pool of cash that is being put to work right now, anticipating the eventual turning of the market," Mr. Hyman said.
On top of the benefit from lower interest rates, there is the stimulating effect of a potential tax cut, "which gets more realistic by the day", he said of President Bush's plan to cut taxes. --------------------

Treasury Bonds Fall
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as investors bet that a second half-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve this month might push stock prices higher, dimming the allure of government debt.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32, to a price of 103 10/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.30 percent from 5.26 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 25/32, to 107 31/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.69 percent from 5.64 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Investors' Advocate at the S.E.C.; 
Departing Chief Leaves Legacy Of Activism

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Within the confines of a two-century-old Quaker meetinghouse here, Arthur Levitt, the departing chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was in his element. In his 43rd, and final, investors' town hall meeting earlier in January, Mr. Levitt sounded the battle cry against financial miscreants -- and the crowd loved it.
 The event, so crowded that people were packed to the balcony, quickly turned into a tribute to Mr. Levitt, the longest-serving S.E.C. chairman ever. There were rounds of applause, a standing ovation and, on the train back to Washington that night, S.E.C. staff members traveling with Mr. Levitt broke open bottles of Champagne to toast their boss. 
 Every moment in Mr. Levitt's eight years at the commission, however, has hardly been so sweet. Coming into office in 1993 -- many say as a consolation prize for not having been named Treasury secretary -- Mr. Levitt staked out an activist stance on behalf of investors that led to head-butting battles with accountants, lawyers, Congress, his own staff, local politicians and financial exchanges. 
"There were a lot in the industry who felt Arthur was too tough on them," said Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton University and a board member of the American Stock Exchange. "But if people think he was too tough, look at the markets. It's been a fabulous period to be on Wall Street."
A former Wall Street executive with an eclectic resume -- drama critic, cattle trader, broker, publisher and stock exchange leader -- Mr. Levitt brought an insider's knowledge and a crusader's attitude to his job as the top securities regulator.
He hit some marks and missed others. He ran up a remarkable string of victories over price fixing on securities exchanges, conflicts of interest among accountants, and influence-peddling in the municipal bond market. He fell short elsewhere. His goal of a single national securities exchange remains unfinished business. 
And, some say his demanding and frequently autocratic style resulted in high staff turnover and often turned the five-member commission into more of a rubber stamp than an independent policy-setting body.
Mr. Levitt began by breaking with the approaches of recent chairmen. John S. R. Shad, also a Wall Street executive, came to office in 1981 with a deregulatory agenda. David S. Ruder's two-year tenure focused on restoring confidence after the 1987 crash. Richard C. Breeden initiated high-profile insider-trading cases after the junk bond scandals.
Mr. Levitt set his tone by putting the words of William O. Douglas, the S.E.C. chairman from 1937 to 1939 who went on to become a Supreme Court justice, at the top of the commission's Web site: "We are the investors' advocate."
While seemingly simple-sounding, investor protection provided an expansionary vision for Mr. Levitt to extend the commission's regulatory reach and gave him a policy wedge to poke into nearly every aspect of the securities business. He did this in spite of a feeling on Wall Street that he was "one of us" and would treat the industry with kid gloves.
" Arthur Levitt proved to be an activist and a reformer," said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School. "He came in with deep connection to the industry and other chairmen with those connections have been temperate in the changes they've made. Instead, he was confrontational and a politician."
His activism expanded the scope of the S.E.C. and elevated the importance of the chairmanship. Yet for all his personal charm and drive, some say, Mr. Levitt could also be thin-skinned about criticism; he still remembers even tiny slights that took place years earlier.
Mr. Levitt also perfected a political style that often consisted of going over people's heads -- directly to the public to rope in a recalcitrant Congress, to the top executives of Wall Street firms to get their underlings in line, to an inner circle of staff members to present a fait accompli to his fellow commissioners.
"I'm intensely competitive and when I get into one of these jobs, I see things as a competition," Mr. Levitt, 69, said in an interview in his Washington office, which he plans to leave on Feb. 9. "I know I did things that my staff didn't like. But I had a limited time. I knew what I wanted to accomplish."
President Bush has yet to nominate Mr. Levitt's replacement. While Washington predictions are often wrong, those mentioned include James Doty and William Heyman, former S.E.C. officials; two Wall Streeters, Frank Zarb and Donald Marron; and Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican.
Mr. Levitt's breakthrough victory came in 1996. After an inquiry by the Department of Justice, the S.E.C. censured the National Association of Securities Dealers, which owns Nasdaq, the world's second-largest stock market. The S.E.C. found that Wall Street dealers colluded to keep spreads between buy and sell prices artificially high, allowing dealers to profit at investors' expense. 
Nasdaq dealers had to pay more than $1 billion to settle the case. Nasdaq was restructured and new trading rules were adopted. As a result, spreads have narrowed by 30 percent on Nasdaq trades, shifting billions of dollars to investors. 
"Arthur Levitt went to the chairman of the N.A.S.D. and said, 'Either you put together a blue-ribbon committee to straighten out this mess, or I will do it,' " said Warren Rudman, a former Republican senator who headed that committee. "Arthur brought to the S.E.C. a deeply held belief the securities business did not have a level playing field for the average American. "
Actions against every major exchange followed -- in 1999 against the New York Stock Exchange for self-dealing among floor brokers and, last year, against the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and others for anticompetitive conduct. 
"The Nasdaq crisis was enormous," Mr. Levitt said. "The whole establishment came down on me."
Still, some complain these efforts only resulted in big trading firms' being favored over small ones. "It means the public has fewer places to do business," said Alan Davidson, president of the Independent Broker-Dealer Association.
Then there was the push to clean up the municipal bond market, where billions of dollars in public bond deals were often handed out on the basis of campaign contributions. The son of a career New York politician, Mr. Levitt staked this out early. "Before I took the job, I knew I would go at that," he said.
The effort resulted in new regulations prohibiting Wall Street firms that are underwriting public bonds from making campaign contributions to the local politicians that hand out this business. This was backed up by several high-profile enforcement cases against major firms like Lazard Freres and Merrill Lynch. These cases resulted in millions in fines, as well as prison terms for some on Wall Street.
"At the beginning of the municipal cases, people were telling us that we were making this stuff up," said Richard H. Walker, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director. "It took a few cases about bribes and kickbacks before people started saying, 'Hey, those guys are onto something.' "
Early on, Mr. Levitt also went to war with Congress, blocking a Republican effort in 1995 to eliminate the S.E.C.'s Investor Education Department. He started investor town hall meetings, required that more financial documents be in plain English and fought Internet scams.
These efforts finally led to Regulation FD, for fair disclosure, a controversial measure that requires corporations not to provide financial information to Wall Street analysts before ordinary investors.
The enactment of Regulation FD, which was opposed by Wall Street and many in Congress, is an example of how Mr. Levitt used political leverage to get his way. He invited important members of Congress to attend town hall meetings -- making the point that he could often draw a bigger crowd in their district than they could. And then, when Regulation FD was in trouble, he unleashed an army of small investors on Capitol Hill.
Still, Regulation FD has received mixed reviews. "It's not clear the investing public gains," said Harold Vogel, an investment manager. "They may be better off when information is digested artfully and the stock moves gradually." But Mario Gabelli, who heads his own investment firm, differs. Regulation FD, he said, "levels the playing field and brings back old-fashioned, bottoms-up, belly-to-belly financial analysis."
Mr. Levitt's relations with Congress have hardly been smooth. One crucial element of the Republican's Contract with America was overhauling litigation law to make it more difficult for shareholders to sue corporations -- a measure Mr. Levitt strongly opposed. He threw himself into the fray, working to minimize the effects of the measure. It ultimately passed over a presidential veto; Mr. Levitt now says it "hasn't been all bad."
He also worked to thwart the effects of the Fields-Markey bill, a deregulatory measure that would have repealed many existing investor protections. It "would have pushed us back to the Stone Age," Mr. Levitt said.
But through cajoling and compromise, the bill was defanged before it passed. "Levitt did a good job in fighting it," said a Democratic banking committee staff member.
It was hardball honed to a fine art.
"His general approach is to lay out a marker and then push to get as close as he could," said John F. Olson, a Washington lawyer for accounting firms attacked by Mr. Levitt. "I don't think anyone who negotiated with Arthur said he caved in."
Within the S.E.C., issues of sagging morale remain. Mr. Levitt is repeatedly described as a demanding boss who reprimanded employees by telling them how much they disappointed him.
Partly because of his managerial style and partly because salaries at the S.E.C. are 40 percent lower than at other financial regulators, turnover at the agency has reached 25 percent in the last two years. Attempts by Mr. Levitt to get better wages have been stonewalled by Congress. That and Mr. Levitt's demanding style resulted in a decision by S.E.C. employees to unionize. 
At the same time, Mr. Levitt's penchant for making decisions within a small circle of advisors has, some say, weakened the role of the commission itself, once an arena for vigorous policy debates. It has become so diminished that securities industry lobbyists in Washington say they rarely bother to attend commission meetings.
If Nasdaq was Mr. Levitt's incoming struggle, his fight with the accounting profession over the integrity of audited financial statements -- the backbone of investment decisions -- was his outgoing battle.
The real fireworks came last year when Mr. Levitt began a push for accounting firms to split their auditing and consulting businesses. Mr. Levitt felt that many auditors had become too cozy with their corporate consulting clients and were relaxing their auditing standards.
A heavy political donor, the accounting industry last year enlisted 46 members of Congress to fight the plan, questioning the S.E.C.'s fairness and its authority to regulate accounting.
Last November, the two sides finally settled. While Mr. Levitt did not succeed in splitting auditing from consulting, the industry accepted strict new ethics rules and limits on the audit business.
"It was a compromise," said Barry Maleancon, president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. "Unfortunately, too much of the debate was in the open."
For Mr. Levitt, that was enough to claim victory: "The accounting profession has paid a terrible price -- they were publicly pilloried. It's a price they don't recognize yet."

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
The Con Con: No Solution? No Problem

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IN unveiling plans for a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, Jets officials aren't bothering to pretend that it makes economic sense. Instead, they're borrowing a theory from other cities: If you build an unprofitable stadium next to an unprofitable convention center, the synergy will miraculously turn their combined red ink into black. 
 That may sound odd, but not by the logic of convention centers. They're the product of politics, not economics. You can think of convention centers as an old political con game, the Con Con, inspired by the urban decay of the last half century. 
 As local businesses and residents fled to suburbia, city officials would dream of a public project to attract out-of-towners. The proposed hall would be promptly embraced by the local beneficiaries: real estate developers, construction unions, hotels, restaurants. Then a consultant would make "projections" that favored the project and that would turn out to be utterly wrong.
The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was typical. It was supposed to pay for itself by reviving a neighborhood and drawing hordes of far-flung visitors. A study in 1973 said Javits could make New York "the leading convention city in the United States." Consultants projected vast spending by the visitors, each of whom would typically pay for at least three nights in a hotel room.
"The projections for Javits got rosier and rosier during the planning process," said Heywood Sanders, a longtime scholar of convention centers, who is the director of the public administration program at the University of Texas at San Antonio. "None of the studies suggested that New York's high hotel costs would be a deterrent, which was in fact what happened."
Instead of the big national conventions promised, Javits has been filled with shows that attract mainly day-trippers. The number of hotel rooms booked by visitors has been less than a tenth of what was projected, Dr. Sanders noted, so the projected economic benefits have never materialized.
"Look at the neighborhood around the Javits Center and what do you see?" Dr. Sanders asked. "Not much. The hotels and restaurants that were promised still aren't there. New York, far from being the leading convention city in America, has been steadily losing market share to other cities."
Still, those mistaken projections aren't deterring today's planners. The Jets' proposal predicts, yet again, that the new Javits "should become the most sought-after convention facility in the country." 
Unfortunately, that sentiment is not shared by the people who actually plan conventions. Dr. Sanders pointed to a 1997 survey in which meeting planners ranked cities' appeal to conventioneers, assuming comparable facilities existed everywhere. Orlando, Fla., ranked first, followed by Las Vegas, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia and, in last place, New York. 
"New York is already losing out to cities with convention centers smaller than Javits," Dr. Sanders said. "Meeting planners are put off by the high expenses and logistical difficulties of New York. Expanding Javits will not solve those problems.
"You'll be entering a competition you're doomed to lose, because other cities have cheaper hotel rooms, cheaper land and cheaper construction costs."
EVEN though there is already a glut of convention space, other cities are rushing to expand their centers. "Over the next five years, there should be a 25 percent increase in capacity," Dr. Sanders said, "but the demand for exhibit space isn't increasing. The convention industry has been essentially flat for the past decade, and has lately showed signs of decline."
Other cities justify their new stadiums and meeting halls as essential to survival, the only ways to keep sports teams and to entice people back downtown. But New York's teams, whichever side of the river they play on, are not about to abandon America's largest television market, and New York has no trouble attracting people to its core.
With Manhattan more crowded than ever, and tourism at record levels, why spend more than $1 billion to attract more visitors? Why, in a city with a severe housing shortage, give away precious real estate near Midtown that could be used by taxpaying residents and businesses?
You can understand how officials in declining cities would desperately try anything that might lure people back to their empty downtowns. But why should New Yorkers fall for the old Con Con? A convention center is a solution that hasn't worked to a problem that doesn't exist.

HEADLINE: ON PRO FOOTBALL; 
Work Has Just Begun for Pained Giants

BYLINE:  By Mike Freeman 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla. 

 BODY:
As Giants Coach Jim Fassel has done all season, he pushed all the right buttons with his team, this time in the emotional and draining moments after the Giants' crushing 34-7 loss to Baltimore in Super Bowl XXXV. With the team gathered around him Sunday night, Fassel told the players how proud he was of them. He implored them to remember this moment and to use it as motivation to get back.
 "We are going to have to work even harder to make a return," he said. "And we will be back." 
 I'm starting to believe anything Fassel says. His predictions are more reliable than Alan Greenspan's. And Fassel is right -- the Giants have an excellent chance of making a return trip next season. But it won't be easy.
As much pain as the Giants are feeling now, the hard part is only beginning. It starts with the vultures circling, picking at the Giants' carcass. Other teams, realizing the Giants have an abundance of talent, will come after their assistant coaches and free agents, beginning the football equivalent of a brain drain.
It has happened to every Super Bowl team. It will happen to the Giants.
The thefts will begin with the defensive coordinator, John Fox, who deserves to be a head coach in the National Football League. He is expected to interview today with Buffalo's general manager, Tom Donahoe, for the Bills' vacant head coaching position. The good news for the Giants on that front is that if Fox does leave, it is believed that Johnnie Lynn, the defensive backs coach, would replace him. Lynn is well respected by the players and the front office. 
Despite Donahoe's denials, it is believed that Fox is Donahoe's first choice by a very slim margin.
Right behind Fox is Baltimore's defensive coordinator, Marvin Lewis, one of the smartest men in football, who was expected to interview with Donahoe last night. Lewis had been planning to meet with Cleveland officials today or tomorrow, according to his agent, Ray Anderson, but the Browns canceled the interview yesterday after hiring Butch Davis from the University of Miami. 
So Fox and Lewis, who are friends, will be competing for the Bills' job. Because Fox has a longstanding relationship with Donahoe, dating to their time together on the Steelers' staff, he has the edge.
But if Lewis does not get a head coaching position this off-season, considering what he did with Baltimore's defense all season and especially in the Super Bowl, it will be a travesty.
The Giants, of course, have their own priorities to attend to. The first is Fassel. He is expected to sign a multiyear contract extension that could at least double his $1.1 million-a-year salary.
Getting Fassel signed to an extension -- quickly -- is extremely important. It will send a signal to the players and the rest of the organization that Fassel is the cemented leader and that the franchise is serious about doing whatever it takes to return to the Super Bowl.
The second priority is signing two soon-to-be free agents, Tiki Barber and Jason Sehorn, to multiyear extensions. Barber is not just a good player, but also a solid person, which makes him doubly valuable. And despite being burned in Super Bowl XXXV, Sehorn is still one of the top cover men in football. He had an excellent season.
If the Giants take care of those issues neatly and quickly, they will restore what is an understandably low morale to a high level after losing such a big game.
But there are going to be unexpected losses for the Giants. A coach no one expects to leave will depart. The team will lose a key backup to free agency. The salary cap will come close to strangling the organization, forcing the Giants to make tough choices. Every Super Bowl team has gone down this road.
That is why it is so difficult to repeat, why six different teams have made it to the championship game the past three seasons.
What is promising for the team is that there has been little finger-pointing among the players. In fact, defensive end Michael Strahan hugged quarterback Kerry Collins after the game, making sure Collins understood that he had support after such a rough evening.
"As awful as we all feel," offensive tackle Lomas Brown said, "now is not the time to start blaming each other. We all lost this one."
"I do think this team has the hunger and character to make it back here next season," Brown added. "I'm ready to start that long climb back right this minute."
After the game, the co-owner Robert Tisch hugged Brown and said, jokingly, "We're getting too old for this." Then Tisch told Brown, "I'll come back next year if you do."
"Oh, I'll be back," Brown said. "We'll all be back."

Leading the New Squeaky-Clean Teamsters

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
THE president of Teamsters Local 282 sat at his desk. A desk, he said, as clean as his union.
 It was oak and varnished to a shine. Its surface was spare and spotless. There were two gold pens in a wooden holder in front of him and a desk calendar where his elbows rested. There was also a wooden box half-full of papers with the word "in" taped to it. 
 "Where is your out box?" he was asked.
"That is the out box," he said.
"But it says it's the in box."
He took a meaty finger and scraped off the word "in." 
"There, now it's the out box," he said, with the self-assured tone of a man who gets things done.
"But now you don't have an in box anymore."
"The in box is right here in front of me, under my elbows," he said. There was a glossy brochure under his elbows and the calendar, nothing more. He smoothed his hair and said, "I like to get the paperwork cleared away to be ready for business." 
Gary La Barbera is no desk jockey, no mimeograph monkey, no paper pusher. He says he is more likely to be found on a job site or in a politician's office. 
It wasn't always that way with the leaders of Teamsters Local 282 in Lake Success, N.Y. They used to be dirty. The local was once the personal piggy bank of Carlo Gambino, the commodore of New York crime bosses. It listed under the weight of corruption for more than 30 years. 
In 1995 the government stepped in, threw the leadership out and inserted corruption officers to monitor the workings of the local. Under the appointed trusteeship of Mr. La Barbera, the union's dealings have become transparent. The work is plentiful, the books are balanced, pensions have nearly doubled and the membership continues to grow. 
As a reward, Mr. La Barbera became the first elected president of Local 282 in more than a decade. He began his three-year term this month. "Mr. La Barbera is a hard worker," said Milton Mollen, the former Appellate Division judge who certified the October election and will oversee the local's workings until the end of 2002. "He's on top of the issues. He's doing his job well."
Mr. La Barbera is smart enough not to take credit. Having come up through the union's ranks as a warehouse forklift operator, he knows he is a representative of the members, not their boss.
"It's solidarity," he said. "That's the strength of the union. Not one individual."
HE was raised in the lap of the middle class. The youngest child of a union man who worked in a warehouse and a homemaker, he grew up in a two-bedroom Cape Cod in Wantagh on Long Island. He was something of a tough guy, "just like everyone else out here," he said with a roguish smile. He finished high school in 1977 and got an associate's degree in business management from Nassau Community College and a certificate in labor management from Cornell Cooperative Extension in Old Westbury, N.Y.
He got into the Teamsters almost by accident. A buddy needed a ride to apply for a union job. He persuaded the young Mr. La Barbera to put an application in himself. The company hired Mr. La Barbera and the friend stayed on the unemployment line.
Once in the union, he fell in love with it. It gave him sense of pride and purpose. He was appointed shop steward of the warehouse where 150 union members worked. He went to meetings, picket lines, bars. He sat on committees. When it came time for the members to pick a trustee, he was their choice.
Mr. La Barbera, 41, is unapologetically pro-American, and he is convinced that unionism is still the only true avenue to good wages and a decent middle-class existence. The catchword nowadays is globalism, but his wife and three children don't live there. They live in Suffolk County, U.S.A. "There's nothing wrong with owning a powerboat and a nice home and a decent car," he said. 
Then he got worked up. He slapped the desk around a bit and bruised the air with that meaty finger. "Why should working people be ashamed of having things? When did it happen that you had to defend a good wage?"
Big Labor has fewer friends in high places. The Nafta accord was signed by a Democratic president, and the unions bitterly opposed the normalization of trade with China. About the only people protesting with them in the streets of Washington and Seattle were hippies in turtle costumes, Mr. La Barbera said. A motley crew of environmentalists and construction workers. 
He does not have an Ivy League degree, but he knows arithmetic, he said. "If you send manufacturing out of the country and they produce all these goods and import them back, then in the long run, who's going to be able to afford them?"
The average driver in Local 282 earns $29 an hour and generous benefits. Mr. La Barbera was recently granted a $25,000 raise by the rank and file. He wears a thin, clipped mustache, is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 270 pounds, having recently lost 30 pounds on an all meat, no bread diet. He wore a dark blue American-made suit that cost $150. His $15 silk tie was of indiscernible national origin. The American-made shoes were leather and the stainless-steel watch bore a Teamsters logo.
"Look, a lot of the problem is that the public sees unions as mob land," Mr. La Barbera said. "It's going to take time to turn that around. But people have to remember, there's no shame in working for a living."

HEADLINE: Jury Awards Soar As Lawsuits Decline OnDefective Goods 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
After years of little change, jury awards to consumers suing over defective products are rising sharply in many industries, from cars and tools to toys and appliances. But at the same time, far fewer such cases are being brought, and many lawyers are turning away clients because their injuries are not debilitating enough to bring in big awards. 
 The median award -- not including punitive damages -- has more than tripled since 1993, from $500,300 to over $1.8 million in 1999, according to a study of 2,751 product-liability verdicts to be released today by LRP Publications, one of the only nonpartisan groups to track cases in several states each year. Much of that rise has come the last three years, and awards are now growing at the fastest rate in two decades. 
 In the mid-1980's, when corporations and politicians warned that a litigation explosion threatened economic growth, the size of defective-product awards actually dropped as often as it climbed. But in recent years, they have increased four times as fast as the sums doled out in medical malpractice lawsuits, even though tort reform has been in full swing and juries have begun giving less to the casualties of fender benders and slips and falls. 
There is no way of knowing if American manufacturers are paying more to injured consumers over all. Most states do not track the number of cases filed much less keep a running tally of outcomes.
Nonetheless, now that George W. Bush is in the White House, after a campaign in which he emphasized his efforts to limit civil damages in Texas, many manufacturers expect him to push for caps on product-liability awards at the federal level.
Manufacturers and defense lawyers have long attributed large verdicts in defective product cases to what they call Robin Hood jurors who relish sitting in judgment of powerful corporations, if only for a day. But a growing number of legal scholars say that rising awards are, to a large degree, the unexpected outcome of rules that make it harder to sue manufacturers and win. 
A series of Supreme Court rulings from 1993 to 1999, embraced by defense lawyers as a way of knocking out lawsuits against companies, have raised the bar on who can testify as expert witnesses, the backbone of any product-liability trial. 
To better their prospects under the new rules, many plaintiffs' lawyers are buttressing their arguments with platoons of experts, and improving their chances of winning by choosing only truly egregious cases involving the most seriously injured parties.
"I've had plenty of defective products, clearly defective, where I won't even talk to the people because their injuries aren't severe enough," said Craig E. Hilborn, president of Hilborn & Hilborn, a small law firm in Birmingham, Mich. "If they're not a quadriplegic, a paraplegic or losing some part of their body, there's no way I'm going to take that case."
In fact, the number of product-liability cases filed in federal court has dropped by more than half the last four years, from 32,856 in 1997 to 14,428 in 2000, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts -- a reflection, some legal scholars say, of how selective many lawyers have become.
It is not that the lawyers are unsympathetic, legal experts argue, but rather a matter of economics. With the greater emphasis on expert witnesses, product-liability suits are increasingly expensive to bring, often costing well above $100,000.
For many lawyers, who usually bear the cost of trying a case and are paid only if they win, picking more seriously injured clients is the surest way to meet expenses and make the substantial risk of losing worthwhile.
"I can't take cases on any more unless I am absolutely positive that I have one worth at least $2 million," said James L. Gilbert, president of the Attorney Information Exchange Group, an organization of about 500 plaintiffs' lawyers nationwide. "I can no longer afford to spend $300,000 trying a case that is only worth $500,000, and that's ridiculous."
For some injured consumers, juries will award more money than their lawyers ask for. In 1997, when a washing machine made by Pellerin Milnor kept spinning, even with the lid open, a curious 4-year-old named Malik Singletary reached inside. After 13 hours of surgery, his arm was reattached, but it functioned poorly and left no feeling in his hand. 
In the 30 years or so the machine has been on the market, at least four other lawsuits for strikingly similar injuries had been filed against Pellerin Milnor, and none had yielded more than a $50,000 settlement, the company said. But after the Singletarys sued for $1 million, the Los Angeles jury that heard their case in 1999 awarded $5 million. "I've never seen anything like that," said Gregory Yates, the family's lawyer, who has been practicing for 28 years.
The insurance industry is blaming the escalating awards for the double-digit increases for basic coverage that many businesses are now facing. They are the highest rate increases since the liability crisis of the mid-1980's, the industry says, when playgrounds were chained shut and diving boards were stripped from pools for fear of the injuries -- and lawsuits -- they might induce.
"It is cause for alarm," said Dr. Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, the industry's primary trade group. "We've seen a much more aggressive trial bar since the tobacco settlement. They are flush with cash and looking to generate a high rate of return."
But as plaintiffs' lawyers seek out more valuable cases, some worry that finding representation has become significantly more difficult, even for those who suffer injuries from truly dangerous products.
"Smaller cases are getting priced out of the market," said Marc Galanter, a professor at the University of Wisconsin law school. "There are people with legitimate injuries who will not be able to take advantage of the redress the law provides." 
Connor Corrigan may be one of them. In 1997, when he was 2 years old, a pickup truck rear-ended his family's 1993 Plymouth Grand Voyager in their hometown of Jacksonville, Fla. The boy was strapped in a car seat behind his mother, but in the impact her seat collapsed backward, smashing his eye socket and fracturing his skull. 
With surgery, he escaped any permanent damages other than a large scar. Still, his parents became enraged when they learned that the minivan's seats had also bent backward in several similar accidents, causing other drivers to lose control and ram nearby cars. DaimlerChrysler, which now makes Plymouth, said that collapsing seats are a common cause of lawsuits for all auto manufacturers, but knew of no design flaws specific to the minivan.
For two years, the Corrigans tried to mount a case, hoping to force Chrysler to fix the problem. But because Connor fully recovered and their economic losses came to about $30,000, paid mostly by insurance, they eventually stopped trying.
"Everyone seems interested until you tell them the details, and then they give you the same story: they can't take it because it's not worth it," said Michael L. Corrigan Jr., Connor's father. "It was very frustrating because every time I see another child sitting in their seat, I still think to this day, 'Oh my God, I know what can happen to them.' "
One big reason defective-product cases have become so expensive to bring, legal experts argue, is that lawyers are bulking up on expensive expert witnesses as never before.
In the past, a case may have rested on a few doctors or engineers who testified that a person's injuries stemmed from a dangerous product, not personal negligence.
But the recent Supreme Court decisions, applying to federal courts but also adopted by a majority of states, have led to a 36-fold increase in the number of courtroom battles over whether testimony by expert witnesses should be allowed in civil cases, according to a recent study by Prof. D. Michael Risinger of the Seton Hall University law school.
In response, plaintiffs' lawyers have begun building fortresses of expert testimony that they hope will withstand any challenges. To prove a car is unsafe, for example, lawyers now routinely hire separate experts to analyze the crash site, the road conditions, the body's response to an impact and the vehicle's design -- then pay other experts in the field to verify the findings.
"These days you need to have experts on experts," said Ned Miltenberg, associate director of legal affairs for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. "And sometimes that doesn't help either."
The wave of experts has helped plaintiffs' lawyers improve their batting average in court. While most injured consumers lose defective product suits, their success rate rose from 39 percent in 1993 to 46 percent in 1999, according to the study by LRP, based in Horsham, Pa.
"It debunks the notion of the frivolous lawsuit," Stephen Daniels, senior research fellow at the American Bar Foundation, a nonpartisan research group. "The plaintiffs' attorneys believe that the tort reform movement has poisoned the jury box, so they're extra prepared."
What juries actually think is a matter of debate, fueled by the widespread attention paid to large awards. Some argue that recent notable cases involving executive cover-ups have led jurors to believe that corporate malfeasance is common. 
In the early 1990's, for example, jurors quipped about the grandmother who spilled coffee in her lap and won a $2.9 million award against McDonald's. But now, some jury experts say, jurors mostly think of the lawsuits brought by states against tobacco companies, and the truckloads of secret documents they uncovered. Increasingly distrustful of corporations in general, jurors are awarding more money, experts say.
"That's the contamination that I'm beginning to see," said Joseph A. Rice, president of the Jury Research Group, which analyzes jurors -- mostly for defendants. "They're drawing from a news item that they've read or heard about and bringing it into the process."
But many academics believe jurors are surprisingly impartial. Valerie P. Hans, a sociology professor at the University of Delaware who has studied juries the last decade, said juries hold corporations to a higher standard than they do individuals but are equally skeptical of plaintiffs, hesitant to side with them simply to bond with the underdog.
Nor are demographic factors like race, sex or income likely to influence a juror's mind, she said, even though lawyers often view them as predictors of how a jury will decide. 
"It's a myth," said Professor Hans, who interviewed hundreds of jurors in the Northeast. "In fact, people you might expect to have a sense of being oppressed by big business often seem to have less sympathy for those who are suing corporations. But if they believed in a litigation explosion, then they were the defense's best friend.'
Most defective product lawsuits are filed in state court, leaving some proponents of tort reform to wonder how effective any efforts by the Bush administration to limit jury awards can be. Several longstanding advocates of caps on awards in civil lawsuits have left the Senate, making it potentially more difficult to have such legislation passed. 
"The assumption is that Republicans are going to line up in support of tort reform, and that is incorrect," said Victor Schwartz, general counsel to the American Tort Reform Association, which backs limits on civil awards. "It's not going to happen. The votes aren't there."

Cyber-Serfdom

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
The Davos World Economic Forum is always useful for gauging global trends. In recent years much of the buzz at Davos was about what technology will do for us. This year, more and more, the buzz has been what technology is doing to us. If Davos is any indicator, there is a backlash brewing against the proliferation of technology in our lives.
 When participants arrived at Davos this year they were given yet another gadget to communicate with other participants -- a Compaq pocket PC. As I fumbled around trying to figure out how mine worked, and interfaced with the complex Davos e-mail system that you access with a badge, the Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen, who was trying to do the same, said to me: "I have so many devices now to make my life easier that I need someone just to carry them all around for me." 
 Then there was the panel about the 21st-century corporation, during which participants described this age of digital Darwinism in chilling terms: The key to winning in business today is adapt or die, get wired or get killed, work 24 hours a day from everywhere or be left behind. Finally, during the question time, Howard Stringer, chairman of Sony America, stood up and said: "Doesn't anyone here think this sounds like a vision of hell? While we are all competing or dying, when will there be time for sex or music or books? Stop the world, I want to get off."
To be sure, this is a developed-world problem. In much of Africa you don't see executives walking around, as you do in Europe, with so many beepers, phones and pagers clipped onto their belts that they look like telephone repairmen. But with the cost of this technology rapidly decreasing, it will spread faster than you think. And so will the social stresses associated with it. Apropos of such a future, I heard a lot of new phrases this week: "device creep," "Machines don't serve us, we serve them," and "My identity is now less important than the data that is stored about me." Have a nice day. 
My favorite, though, was that we now live in an age of what a Microsoft researcher, Linda Stone, called continuous partial attention. I love that phrase. It means that while you are answering your e-mail and talking to your kid, your cell phone rings and you have a conversation. You are now involved in a continuous flow of interactions in which you can only partially concentrate on each.
"If being fulfilled is about committing yourself to someone else, or some experience, that requires a level of sustained attention," said Ms. Stone. And that is what we are losing the skills for, because we are constantly scanning the world for opportunities and we are constantly in fear of missing something better. That has become incredibly spiritually depleting. 
I am struck at how many people call my office, ask if I'm in, and, if I'm not, immediately ask to be connected to my cell phone or pager. (I carry neither.) You're never out anymore. The assumption now is that you're always in. Out is over. Now you are always in. And when you are always in you are always on. And when you are always on, what are you most like? A computer server.
They say these devices will eventually be invisible, but for now they feel in your face. And here's the scary part: It's just the beginning. By 2005 we will see a convergence of wireless technology, fiber optics, software applications and next-generation Internet switches, IP version 6, that will permit anything with electricity to have a Web address and run off the Internet -- from your bedroom lights to your toaster to your pacemaker (which will report your heart rate directly to your doctor). This Evernet will allow us all to be online all the time from everywhere. People will boast: "I have 25 Web addresses in my house; how many do you have? My wired refrigerator automatically reorders milk. How about yours?"
The problem is that human beings simply are not designed to be like computer servers. For one thing, they are designed to sleep eight hours a night. So there is a big misfit brewing here. I still can't program my VCR; how am I going to program my toaster? As Jeff Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management and author of a smart new book that deals with some of these themes, "The Mind of the CEO," said: "Maybe it's not time for us to adapt or die, but for the technology to adapt or die."

HEADLINE: Why San Diego, Where Rates First Rose, No Longer Conserves Energy 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
It was here, in the heat of last summer, that consumers got their initial lesson in how painful California's experiment with deregulation could be.
 With electricity supplies short and the state's power grid on the brink of collapse, wholesale electricity costs nearly tripled, and the San Diego Gas and Electric Company, the first utility in the state freed by deregulation, passed those costs on to its customers. Homeowners took to the streets, and businesses threatened to leave the city, California's second largest. 
 Logic would suggest that San Diego consumers, having felt the price shock that the rest of the state so far had been shielded from, would be wiser about using electricity than other Californians. But the price shock was too short. 
In September, California legislators called off the experiment, capping retail electrical rates at 6.5 cents a kilowatt hour, the average market price paid in the month before the summer crisis.
Now, six months later, San Diegans are back to their old ways.
Electricity use, which dropped 9 percent in August, is back up to precrisis levels, according to San Diego Gas and Electric. Rather than investing in insulation or energy-efficient air-conditioners, consumers here seem to be hovering between denial and defiance.
"I feel I do all that I can to conserve," said Vicki Barber, an escrow coordinator for a real estate broker in San Diego. "But I'm not going to spend all this money upgrading my house when it doesn't matter anyway."
As a test laboratory of consumer behavior when the cost of a necessity skyrockets, San Diego seems confused by how politicians reacted when consumers here revolted last summer, demanding relief.
In September, when California legislators restored the lower rates, residential and small-business rate payers received credits on their utility bills -- even though the credits are really a postponed debt that is expected to come due as soon as 2002. And it is true that the utility's largest customers are already paying market rates.
Still, Jeannie Thompson's reaction was typical. In August, Ms. Thompson, the branch manager of a Coldwell Banker real estate office in the Pacific Beach district, made it her business to turn off office lights and computers every night. "When the news first came out, you wanted to do your part," she said.
Then, in October, the office got its credit, and "we started to go back to the way things were before."
Economists look at San Diegans' behavior and draw this lesson: Consumers must suffer a lot before they willingly give up comfort and conveniences they have grown used to.
"Summer should have been a wake-up call," said Peter Navarro, associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of California at Irvine. "You can't blame San Diego consumers for not doing anything, because legislators stepped in and lowered prices. If the discomfort isn't of a lengthy duration, the adjustments to behavior that need to take place won't."
Indeed, in a recent paper, a group of energy experts and economists, including two Nobel Prize winners, made the same point, saying that if consumers knew the true cost of electricity, they would conserve more.
Even Gov. Gray Davis seems to be backing away from his promise that rates would not rise. 
But San Diego consumers, once again insulated from rate increases, have shrugged off the crisis, in part because they have taken to heart the governor's oft-repeated claim that the problems are the fault of out-of-state power generators that need to be reined in.
"Ask these people if they feel safe at night," Pete Phelps said wryly of those generators. Mr. Phelps, an airline pilot, was, with his wife, Pat, loading a 50-gallon water heater into the back of his pickup truck at a Home Depot near the San Diego Sports Arena.
Mrs. Phelps added, "You don't know what is legitimate, who to believe." 
So the Phelpses have done little in recent months to conserve, except turning off lights, as their monthly electricity bill has climbed to $130, from about $85, in the past two years. Their new water heater was billed as "energy efficient," and while it should save them $150 a year, they did not buy it with conservation in mind. "I spill that in beer money," Mr. Phelps said.
High prices alone cannot change consumer behavior, Mr. Navarro, the economist, said. If consumers, for instance, believe that turning off lights benefits someone other than themselves, they will feel no incentive to conserve. That, he said, is the situation in the Pacific Northwest, where many residents believe that any power they save will simply be diverted to hot tubs in the San Francisco suburbs. 
But in San Diego, people have gotten a particularly mixed message. To begin with, high rates did not last long enough to make an impact. Rather, the lingering impression was that legislators would step in to protect consumers at any cost.
The math, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute, was simple.
"If you go from 6 cents to 22 cents to 6 cents, then the response will be to weather the storm," Mr. Borenstein said, referring to the price of a kilowatt hour. "But if it stays at 22 cents, then it makes sense for people to go out and invest in ways to save energy."
Mr. Borenstein drew a parallel to the gasoline shortages of the 1970's. At first, he said, motorists demonized Middle East oil producers, as lines of cars snaked around gasoline stations, waiting for rationed supplies. Only after high prices persisted did consumers begin to change their habits, buying more fuel-efficient cars, he said.
Still, some San Diegans insist that they are pitching in.
"I have not put the heat on," said Ms. Thompson, the real estate agent. "I close my doors and put on a sweater."
But she has not had an energy audit of her home, a service provided by San Diego Gas and Electric, or bought energy-saving appliances.
During last summer's price spike, surveys by San Diego Gas and Electric found that 91 percent of its 1.2 million users did not think the utility was being wholly honest with them about the crisis, said Stephen L. Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the utility's parent company. And there is bound to be more anger, now that the utility has requested a surcharge of about 16 percent in March, to pay off $450 million it owes its power suppliers.
Higher rates will also make life harder for people who are just getting by. At a recent outdoor farmer's market in El Cajon, a working-class town 15 miles east of San Diego, Heidi Van Horn, a massage therapist, and her fiance, Bernie Herloss, a handyman, were supplementing their $1,200 monthly income by selling grilled bratwurst and hamburgers to hungry shoppers.
For the two-bedroom apartment they share, the couple have $200 in past-due energy bills. Those bills hover at about $100 a month, up from $55 two years ago. "We aren't one of these high-rollers who make $9 an hour," Ms. Van Horn said. "We either pay the electricity or have the phone shut off."
Even so, she said, they do what they can to conserve, turning down the thermostat or turning off the occasional light. But their apartment building is poorly insulated. Cold wind seeps in through closed windows, and the heating vents are near the ceiling, where the warmth is wasted. Their only energy-efficient light bulb is the one that came in the mail from San Diego Gas and Electric.
And the two birds and the iguana they keep, Ms. Van Horn said, would die if she turned off any of the three heat lamps that run continuously in the apartment.
She would never consider getting rid of the pets. Ms. Van Horn said. "They are family."

HEADLINE: Dartmouth and Town Reel In Wake of Double Killing 

BYLINE:  By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H., Jan. 29 

 BODY:
Dartmouth College grappled today with grief and fear and uncertainty in the wake of the murder of two widely beloved professors, Half and Susanne Zantop, a German emigre couple found dead in their home on Saturday night.
 Normally, Dartmouth, an Ivy League college with about 5,500 students set in rural New Hampshire, is "a place where people have a sense of confidence, of optimism, of security," James Wright, the college's president, said today. "An event such as this shatters for many that sense of confidence, of optimism, and of security." 
 And it is hard to grieve, Mr. Wright said, with so many questions unanswered. 
The Zantops were killed not on campus but in their contemporary style house about four miles away in the town of Etna, a wooded hilly spot of old barns and stone walls. 
But it was on the campus where the murders' aftermath was most visible, in widespread mourning and speculation and added security.
"I'm from a big city where tons of people get killed every week and no one really cares," said Jourdan Abel, a sophomore from Miami. "But there's this feeling that this is the perfect school, the perfect town, no one locks their door. It's like something has disturbed our perfectness."
"Yesterday my roommates and I locked the door while we were in our room," Ms. Abel said. "That's definitely a new thing." 
The authorities said today that they had advised Dartmouth that there was no specific reason to believe students were in danger and that it did not need to increase its security. They would not say how the Zantops had been killed but said the crime had been ruled a double homicide. 
The college has taken several reassuring measures, however, including offering rides to students 24 hours a day instead of just at night and increasing the visibility of its safety and security staff. 
Asked today why a killer on the loose was not considered a threat to the public, Kelly Ayotte, the chief of the homicide unit of the New Hampshire attorney general's office, repeated to reporters that there was no "specific information at this point to believe there is a current threat to public safety."
"There is no reason for there to be panic in the public right now," Ms. Ayotte said.
She declined to comment on the investigation, saying only that it was making progress, as 30 investigators worked on it full time.
Such silence is frustrating to some: "I think they're doing all they can," said Amanda Behm, a freshman. "But it feels like they don't have very much information and I know they don't have much, but I want to know -- is it over? Are we still in danger?"
Ms. Behm's mother sent her an e-mail message, she said, asking, "What is going on? I thought you were safe in this town." 
Colleagues and friends described the Zantops, who had two adult daughters living in other states, as an exceptionally active and generous couple, both socially and academically. Susanne Zantop, 55, was the chairwoman of the German department; she had also taught comparative literature and was the parents' distinguished research professor in the humanities. Half Zantop, 62, was a specialist in economic geology, and had been a professor in the earth sciences department since 1976. 
Both Zantops were known for helping colleagues and students and for keeping the doors of their house open to friends and acquaintances.
The Zantops "were really both remarkable people," said Bruce Duncan, a professor of German studies. "They were generous and open and very international in focus. They tended to reach out to a wide variety of people."
Susannah Heschel, head of Jewish studies at Dartmouth, said that she and many others were too shocked to speculate about who had killed the Zantops. "People are crying and people are in shock and people are in denial. I have a feeling that they are on a trip and they are going to come back and tell us about their adventure," Ms. Heschel said.
For those trying to understand the crime, however, one area of speculation has revolved around the question of whether the Zantops might have been repaid for a kindness with violence.
Audrey McCullom, the Zantops' next-door neighbor and a retired therapist, recalled that Half Zantop had tried to help a mentally ill young man in the past and said, "If a student, a faculty member, a community member turned to Half in distress, Half could underestimate the degree to which a troubled person was truly ill."
Ms. McCullom's husband, a doctor, and her daughter were the first people to see the bodies after they were discovered by a guest who arrived for dinner at the Zantop home on Saturday. 
The guest ran next door to the McCulloms, and Ms. McCullom's husband and daughter went to the scene, she said, where they found Mrs. Zantop's body in the study in a pool of blood and Mr. Zantop's nearby. They had apparently been dead for several hours.
Although he has seen much as a doctor, Ms. McCollum said, her husband said, " 'This was the most awful thing I had ever seen.' "
Hanover, a town of nearly 10,000, is considered one of Dartmouth's drawing points, a bucolic haven that looks safe and quiet compared with the settings of most other Ivy League colleges and universities. It last had a murder -- the slaying of two graduate students -- in 1991, and the one before that, the police say, was at least 50 years ago.
Today, Eric Winn, a freshman, said he did not feel scared, that Dartmouth still had one of the safest campuses in the country. 
But Laura Smalligan, another freshman, admitted to feeling a bit scared since she saw several detectives this afternoon investigating something -- it was not clear what -- in the basement of her dormitory. Asked if she would still walk alone at night, she said, "I'll probably be more scared doing it, but I still will."

HEADLINE: Earthquake Survivors Cite Confusion in Rescue Effort 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: BHUJ, India, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
Two babies an 8-month-old boy and a 7-month-old girl -- were rescued today after three days in the rubble here, symbols of the heartbreak and the singular miracles of India's killer earthquake.
 The boy, Murtza Ali, was found in the lap of his dead mother. The girl, Sweta Kumar, was rescued from the rubble of her home in a town east of Bhuj. Hours later, she was returned to her joyous mother, Bhawna. 
 The rescues offered a rare cause for hope after Friday's quake, whose damage is now estimated at up to $5.5 billion. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who visited Bhuj today, acknowledged that India was ill-prepared for such disasters.
Survivors say confusion and a lack of equipment is hampering rescue efforts. Rescuers lack cranes and bulldozers, and many units do not have generators for lights, making night work impossible. 
The hope of finding many more survivors "is dwindling hour by hour, but as long as there is hope, we won't give up," said Joachim Ahrens, who represents a Swiss rescue team in Bhuj.
In the newest estimates of damage, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and the industry secretary, Gen. Amit Mitra, said losses might be as high as $5.5 billion, and added that production losses were running $110 million a day. Officials in Gujarat state put forward a much lower figure, $2.17 billion.
A grim Mr. Vajpayee, who toured Bhuj, Ahmedabad and other cities in Gujarat today, said he was forming a national disaster agency to ensure immediate response to emergencies.
"The country is not ready to face such disasters," Mr. Vajpayee told reporters in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's economic hub. He also announced federal grants totaling almost $110 million for the state.
In New Delhi today, the agriculture minister, Bhaskar Barua, appealed to private aid groups for field hospitals, clothing and cranes and other equipment, as well as volunteers to put up tents and prepare and distribute food.
As recently as Sunday, Mr. Barua said it was the policy of his government not to ask for foreign aid, but today he expressed thanks for the foreign help that had been offered. Such offers so far include $14.6 million from Britain, $8 million from Unicef, $6.1 million from Germany and $5 million from the United States. More than two dozen other nations have pledged to help, and six -- France, Israel, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Turkey -- are sending substantial medical teams. 
Here at the scene, however, the routine of death must also be observed, over and over. 
At the Lohna Samshran crematorium today, every effort was made to follow Hindu tradition in sending the dead into the next life with respect.
Normally each body is placed on its own funeral pyre, but that has not been the case since Friday. More than 6,200 dead have been registered across western India, but officials in Bhuj believe that between 15,000 and 20,000 people may have died here alone.
As many as 16 bodies were being placed on a single pyre, and they were not being segregated by caste.
By today Mr. Thakkar and his workers had cremated 387 bodies, and more were being brought in by truck and stretcher. Despite the enormity of the task, most Hindu traditions were followed.
Tears running down their faces, relatives shared their grief along with the funeral pyres.
"We were very proud of our brother and his job," Damor Balawat Nuvajubhai said. The body of his brother, Damor Rajendrakumar Nuvajubhai, 24, was wrapped in a sheet and placed on a pyre; he died while working as a nurse at the civilian hospital in Bhuj, one of 36 nurses killed when the building collapsed.
Damor Balawat took a large can of clarified butter and poured some onto the logs. He and his three other brothers then sat on the stack of wood, quietly weeping for an hour until three other bodies were placed on it.
Crematorium workers, wearing baseball caps and scarves over their mouths, placed more logs on top of the bodies and helped relatives of the victims start the fire and stoke it into a roaring blaze.
The only sound came from the crackle of the fire and the engines of heavy trucks jamming the streets with relief supplies. 
Bhuj is in a semi-desert with few trees, so officials have called for donations of wood. Outside Lohna Shamshran, trucks unloaded tons of lumber donated from all over India for the 12 pyres. --------------------

World Bank Offers $300 Million
NEW DELHI, Jan. 29 (Agence France-Presse) -- The World Bank offered India $300 million today to help recover from the earthquake that struck Gujarat and killed at least 6,300 and possibly as many as 20,000.
The World Bank said in a statement that within six months it would also put together a longer-term assistance plan in consultation with the Gujarat state government.
The national finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, asked on Sunday for a $1.5-billion loan from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to aid the recovery, a billion from the World Bank and half a billion from the development bank. 
The Asian Development Bank said today in a statement that "the A.D.B. is ready to extend all technical and financial assistance within its capability to help the state of Gujarat and Government of India restore the affected areas," initially by deploying disaster management experts to assess the damage. 
Mr. Sinha also said the two state-run insurance firms, the Life Insurance Corporation and the General Insurance Corporation, would be instructed to settle quake claims immediately. Gujarat is one of India's most prosperous and industrialized states.

HEADLINE: As Law Firms Scramble for New Talent, The New Talent Reaps the Rewards 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
AS a 1998 graduate of Rutgers, with a degree in criminal justice and sociology and a willingness to share an apartment, David Dugan went to work for the American Arbitration Association. It was a "decent job," he said, paying about $24,000 a year.
 But that was before law school. Last summer, after his first year at Rutgers School of Law in Newark, he discovered his new market value. The law firms descended in search of this year's summer associates, who are practically assured of permanent offers later. And among Manhattan firms looking for starting associates with credentials like Mr. Dugan's, the going rate is $125,000. That doesn't include the guaranteed bonus of $25,000. 
 "I hadn't really thought about it," Mr. Dugan said. "It was just a nice surprise." 
At Rutgers, as at most law schools, a basic rule of supply and demand is at work: in a nation that would probably find it hard to believe and harder to appreciate, there is a shortage of legal talent.
It is no longer news that elite law firms, having matched the eye-popping increases in salaries started by a Silicon Valley firm a year ago, are elbowing one another for the opportunity to pay people just out of school more than federal judges earn. But what began as an arms race among major powers has nudged up demand for law school graduates everywhere. 
The demand has not faltered even in an academic year that began with ominous news about the dot-coms that set off the salary escalation by luring some young and well-credentialed lawyers away from conventional practices.
THE law business, like the real estate business, generally expands with the overall economy. 
"The market for corporate legal services depends on the number of business transactions," said Prof. John P. Heinz of the Northwestern University Law School, a former executive director of the American Bar Foundation, a research organization. 
But while the economy has grown by about two-thirds since 1980, law school enrollment has barely budged. Since a surge of new schools during the 1970's, bringing the total to 169 from 144, very few have entered the market. 
Moreover, Professor Heinz said, "New schools have a brand-name problem, and they end up supplying more at the bottom of the market."
Since 1980, the schools have kept the number of new places between 40,000 and 44,000 a year. Applications, meanwhile, have zigzagged between a low point of 60,000 (in 1985) and a high point of 99,000 (in 1991). 
"Among the 25 schools that think they're in the top 10, you have relatively modest growth, where you have had any growth," said J. William Elwin Jr., the director of professional development and training at Shearman & Sterling, a Manhattan-based law firm. 
The demand is by no means even. Professor Heinz said there was a persistent surplus of lawyers who handle slip-and-fall cases, divorces and criminal defense. In a profession that gauges status finely and obsessively, he said, "some law schools supply one market and some supply others." 
Nonetheless, he said, as firms that once hired everyone they needed from Harvard, Yale and Columbia claim an ever larger share of law graduates each year, students at the middle-to-top-tier schools are benefiting. That group includes Rutgers law school. This fall, employers went "deeper into the class" to fill their interview schedules, Dawne M. Smith, the placement director, said. She noted that many interviewers arrived with greeters, whose job was cordially pitching their firms.
Debra King, the placement director at Seton Hall University Law School, also in Newark, said, "Firms are turning to their so-called alternative schools, like us, not just the Ivies." 
This fall, Ms. King said, at least three national law firms that "generally don't come over the river" came for on-campus interviewing. The school also had recruiters from firms in San Francisco and Palo Alto, Calif.
At Brooklyn Law School, the number of jobs listed with the career services office in 2000 increased 41 percent from 1998, said Joan A. King, the director of placement. 
Ms. King said salaries at the smaller firms and government agencies that employ most Brooklyn graduates were also rising. 
"Finally the D.A.'s offices are paying decently," she said. "That's a good side effect."
Still, at $38,000 to $47,500, the pay for those new graduates is about what the average city transit worker receives. Ms. Smith said one recent graduate, now working in a prosecutor's office, had sent an e-mail message that said, as Ms. Smith recalled: "I'm working for $33,000 a year and I have $76,000 in student loans. I can't do it."
Public-interest employers, the nonprofit organizations that for years have relied on the socially committed and self-sacrificing, drew 1 percent of 1999 graduates, down from 5.9 percent in 1986.
"You do see people taking firm jobs who wouldn't have a couple of years ago," Ms. Smith said. "And this used to be known as the People's Electric Law School." 
More surprising to placement officials is the number of students forgoing judicial clerkships, despite their resume-enhancing value. Ms. Smith said that while 77 students in the class of 1998 took clerkships, in the class of 2000 she has counted a little over 40. 
"I have judges coming out of the woodwork," she said.
While this market should foster happiness among law students -- Ms. King at Brooklyn spoke of "an overall sense of well-being" -- it has also created expectations that are easily disappointed. 
"Some of them are very cocky," Ms. Smith said. "Then the student who comes out of law school and gets $60,000 feels it isn't acceptable when a colleague is making $125,000."
News of salaries and much more is never farther away than the Web, where message boards like Greedy Associates (www.infirmation.com) report salary and bonus schedules and exchange advice ("take all the money you've hoarded and run") and commentary ("much of what I do is chimp work"). 
Derek Craig, a second-year student and member of law review at Rutgers, said that salaries were definitely a factor in drawing classmates to large New York law firms, instead of to government or the nonprofit sector. "I need to pay off my loans," said Mr. Craig, 29, adding, "What's really scary is the debt." 
He explained that he had spent the three years before law school teaching English in Taiwan for "$1,000 U.S. a month, tops."
Mr. Dugan, who is 24, agreed that six-figure salaries helped attract people to Manhattan. 
"As much as this is an academic experience, I don't know one person who would say money isn't a factor," he said, though he is applying for clerkships and is not ruling out a job in government later. 
Having been selected for the law review and the moot court board, Mr. Dugan is among those who will have a choice. He received his first summer job offer in early September and ended up with five offers.
Kelso Anderson, 26 and another second-year student on the law review, said, almost apologetically, "I did have many offers" after interviewing with New York and New Jersey firms. 
MR. ANDERSON, 26, who came to the United States from Jamaica 10 years ago, said the market "was certainly not what I expected," even though his sister practices law in Manhattan. 
"I never knew I would be this fortunate," he explained. 
Like many students, though, he said he worried that the good times might expire soon, perhaps before he finishes his one-year clerkship with a New Jersey Supreme Court justice. (As he enters this risk-averse profession, Mr. Anderson is taking a bankruptcy course.) 
The market has heated up and then frozen before. When Ms. Smith graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1986, big firms could not raise salaries fast enough: Less than an hour after she reported for her first day at a top-paying New York firm, all the new associates were told that they were being given a $10,000 raise.
A few years later, many firms were shedding associates. Ms. Smith's firm had fallen apart.
So now, she said, even in the hiring wave last fall, employers were restrained. "Many of the firms learned a valuable lesson in the 80's: that they shouldn't hire more people than they can sustain," she said.
Law schools are apparently following the same general rule. Applications are climbing modestly after a big downturn in the mid-1990's, but they remain below the level of a decade ago. 
Professor Heinz at Northwestern said that in the meantime, some law schools have quietly chosen to shrink their classes rather than "dip down farther in the applicant pool." 
And the hierarchy of the legal profession, while loosening, is not crumbling. Many students do not have jobs lined up for the summer or fall, and most who go into private practice will join firms of fewer than 50 lawyers. For the firms, to be elite is to be large. 
In the most recent survey of starting salaries by the National Association for Law Placement, the median was $40,000 in firms of 2 to 10 lawyers and $97,000 in firms of more than 500. 
The biggest firms, meanwhile, are hewing to certain status lines in law school recruiting. 
"As desperate as we've been, we're just now talking about putting our toe into the second tier," said a manager at a Manhattan firm. 
Like most partners and recruiting managers, this one would speak only on condition of anonymity. As Ms. Smith said, "Who's going to want to go to a firm that can't find anybody?"

HEADLINE: Some Brands To Be Sold By Unilever 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant that bought Bestfoods in the United States last year, said today that it had agreed to sell some of its European sauces and packet-soup businesses to Campbell Soup for about $920 million to satisfy conditions imposed by regulators when they approved the Bestfoods deal.
 Today's sale means that some stalwart European brands, like Batchelor's dry soup mix and Oxo bouillon cubes in Britain and Leiseur Mayonnaise in France, will change hands, as Unilever, based in London and Rotterdam, purges its stable of overlaps with Bestfoods products like Knorr soups and Hellman's mayonnaise. The price was generally in line with analysts' expectations. 
 Unilever executives also said that the group was close to a long-expected sale of Bestfoods Baking, which could fetch as much as $1.4 billion. Unilever is talking to the Sara Lee Corporation about the baking unit, which includes Entenmann's, Freihofer's and other brands in the United States, but it has declined to give details of the negotiations.
In a television interview from Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the World Economic Forum, Antony Burgmans, the Unilever co-chairman, said today that news of a deal would emerge "pretty soon," but he did not elaborate.
Unilever's divestitures have fueled speculation among analysts that it might be planning to bid for the Clairol cosmetics business in America, which is being sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb. But Nicolas Sochovsky, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said Unilever was far more likely to use the proceeds to pay off debt, which stood at 1.8 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last September, because the company "has got a lot to prove to the market" after the Bestfoods acquisition.
For Campbell, which has struggled to generate earnings growth on its own, the deal will bring significant expansion in Europe, including factories in Britain, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and Sweden that employ about 1,300 workers. The brands Campbell is acquiring have annual sales of about 435 million euros ($402 million), Unilever said. While they have grown only slowly in recent years, they command steady profit margins of around 18 percent.
The deal is still subject to approval by the European regulators whose conditions on the $24.3 billion Bestfoods acquisition led to the sale.
Patrick Cescau, Unilever's foods director, said Campbell had bought all the brands Unilever had to sell, and that by concluding the deal swiftly it had spared its employees some uncertainty. Mr. Sochovsky at Lehman Brothers said a "clean sale" to a single buyer "would be viewed by the market as reasonably positive." Unilever shares rose 2.5 pence, to 509 pence, in London.
Unilever announced a $5 billion program almost a year ago to trim its work force and focus on 400 top-selling brands. But while culling lines, it has also been buying aggressively in the United States, snapping up Slim-Fast Foods and Ben & Jerry's ice cream as well as Bestfoods.

HEADLINE: Cap Gemini Has Contract For Services to4 Hospitals 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The consulting firm Cap Gemini Ernst & Young plans to announce today that it has reached a seven-year $350 million contract to provide technology services to four New York City hospitals, people who helped negotiate the agreement said yesterday.
 The contract, which covers Beth Israel Medical Center, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, all in Manhattan, and Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, reflects Cap Gemini's strategy to expand its operations into what is known as outsourcing, especially in light of the uncertain economy. 
 Under the contract, Cap Gemini will provide computer support and data management services, including accounting, patient billing and communications, to the hospitals. The contract is Cap Gemini's largest in the health care sector.
Outsourcing, which accounts for about 20 percent of Cap Gemini's annual revenue, offers some protection to consulting firms in the event of an economic downturn, said Robert Pryor, head of the company's outsourcing business in the Americas.
"A slowing economy that you see now offers much more significant opportunities for us in the outsourcing space," Mr. Pryor said. That is because when times toughen, he said, companies look to reduce costs by delegating those activities that might be more cheaply performed elsewhere to an outside supplier.
"It forces them to make those general 'make or buy' decisions that they might otherwise put off," he said.
For the four New York hospitals, which belong to Continuum Health Partners Inc., a holding company and client of the consulting arm of Ernst & Young, now part of Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, the outsourcing agreement should lower costs, said Gail F. Donovan, who as chief operating officer at Beth Israel Medical Center was involved in negotiating the agreement.
"It's our largest outsourcing experience," Ms. Donovan said. The agreement should allow the hospitals to standardize their computer systems to make it easier to share information, she said. 
Using Cap Gemini will also eliminate the need for the hospitals to try to retain technology-savvy professionals, who are prone to leave for more profitable jobs outside the health care industry, she added.
"It was very difficult for us to maintain any consistency in our staff," she said.
As part of the agreement, the hospitals have sold their computer hardware to Cap Gemini for $5 million and laid off 275 employees who worked with that equipment, Ms. Donovan said. Cap Gemini will hire those employees, she said.

HEADLINE: Transition Time, and Washington Is Waist-Deep in Resumes 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
GEORGE W. BUSH won not only the presidency and the chance to set national policy, but also the spoils that come with victory -- the chance to appoint thousands of people to jobs in his administration, from confidential secretaries to cabinet secretaries. And the White House is far from the only place where the desks are now piled high with resumes. 
 From K Street to Capitol Hill, Washington is in a state of flux remarkable even for a capital that has come to expect a good deal of turnover in the months after a national election. Not only did the presidency itself change hands, but the protracted way in which the election was decided added more uncertainty and delay to the job-hunting process. 
 When the election logjam finally broke, it unleashed a torrent of activity. 
"I wouldn't be surprised if there are 100,000 resumes that the Bush team has probably already received," said John H. Trattner, the vice president of the Council for Excellence in Government, a nonprofit organization here that aims to improve government performance. "Some people are just ringing the doorbell and asking for a job. Others are angling with influence. Some have given money to a campaign, others were already in the Bush campaign. A lot of people think they have a leg up in getting a job."
Job hunting in Washington falls into three concentric rings, the first starting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. From the cabinet down, there are 7,500 presidential appointees at nearly every level in the executive branch. These people come and go with the administration and are hired because of their agreement with the president's political objectives and solid partisan ties. 
Many of these jobs are considered plums, and all are listed, along with salaries and the names of the current occupants, in a 334-page government publication called the Plum Book -- which actually gets its name from the color of its binding. (It is available on the Web, at www.gpo.gov/plumbook/ 2000/.) A companion volume, distributed free to office seekers by the Council for Excellence in Government, is called the Prune Book. (A prune, the council explains, is "a plum seasoned with experience and wisdom.") Also available on the Web, at www.excelgov.org, it provides far more specific information about many administration jobs, including the necessary qualifications and the issues the job entails.
"To get one of these top jobs, you need to be able to put up with delay, confusion and a fair amount of uncertainty," said Paul Light, an expert on government employment at the Brookings Institution, the Washington policy study group.
The next ring is Capitol Hill, where even the garage attendants and elevator operators are political hires. Each member of Congress has a staff of 10 to 15, and powerful members have control over thousands of appointments to the professional staffs that do the legwork on the committees that oversee the budget, appropriations and all the issues that come before Congress.
The majority party typically gets two-thirds of all committee jobs. But with the Senate now divided 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, the two parties have agreed on a power-sharing arrangement that will give each equal staffing on all committees. This means that on the Senate side, at least, things will be tighter for Republicans.
In the final ring, there is everyone else: career civil servants who may find themselves suddenly sent to a far-flung spot or who do not share the views of their incoming bosses; news media bureaus that typically use a change in the White House as a time to move employees around; and lobbying firms that are trying to beef up their staffs with people with fresh contacts and a knowledge of Washington's inner workings.
For six years, David R. Runkel was the chief spokesman for the House Banking Committee. Now he is looking for a job. With term limits removing his boss, Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, as chairman of that committee, the new committee head will name his own communications director. 
"I knew this would happen, and last summer I started making inquiries," said Mr. Runkel, himself a Republican. "Right now, I'm exploring options on the Hill. I like working for government because there are so many interesting policy issues, and I know dozens of other people who are also in the middle of change, too."
On the Democratic side, the retirement of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey meant that his entire staff had to look for jobs. Many have found them, including Daniel E. Katz, Mr. Lautenberg's former legislative director, who became a lobbyist for the nonprofit group Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.
Mr. Katz said he would have sought an administration job had Al Gore won the election. "Once Gore was defeated," he said, "it means there are something like 5,000 more Democrats on the street and a couple thousand more in agencies that don't want to work for Bush -- or expect to be transferred to the mailroom." 
While Mr. Katz is happy to have landed where he did, he said the last two months were bumpy. "Lots of people were committed Democrats who worked for Lautenberg until the end," he said. "Then they found their chance for an administration job was gone. There was chaos in town and no one knew what was happening on the Hill."
Retha Sherrod, Mr. Lautenberg's communications director, said that while her boss had announced his retirement plans months ago, a combination of the flow of daily work and the uncertainty about the election kept her from looking full time for a new job -- until now. "The job market in Washington right now is flooded with unemployed Democrats," said Ms. Sherrod, who had worked as a television producer in New York before joining Mr. Lautenberg's staff two years ago. 
A colleague, Tralonne Shorter, has become a lobbyist at Peyser Associates and will track the course of legislation, just as she did for Senator Lautenberg. "As a Democrat, I knew I could get work with Gore in office," she said. "But with Bush, I had to restrategize."
The troubles of Linda Chavez and, before her, Zoe Baird and Kimba M. Wood, whose nominations were derailed over allegations about people who had worked in their homes years earlier, may make many people wonder whether a political appointment is worth the highly public, highly partisan scrutiny that goes with the territory. The Brookings Institution's Web site (www.brookings.org) has a "frequently asked questions" section for job seekers that includes questions like: When I was in college, I smoked marijuana from time to time. Will this disqualify me? And, I've been using a nanny to care for my kids. Will I be asked to report that?
Despite such drawbacks, thousands are drawn to Washington's political power grid and, once there, often stay on in the private-sector jobs that feed off politics.
"People are moving constantly, and that's the nature of this town," said Mr. Light of Brookings. "This town is really sized to accommodate a certain number of people who leave Capitol Hill and go to trade associations or people in lobbying firms who go to the administration. There is a political class and, ultimately, they all seem to find work."

Better Drag Those Skeletons Out of the Closet
The phone rings, and a familiar Texas twang comes on the line with an offer to come to Washington and be part of the new administration. You're flattered. You're terrified. You accept the offer. What do you do now? 
What follow are excerpts from a "A Survivor's Guide for Presidential Nominees," a new manual by two Washington nonprofit organizations, the Council for Excellence in Government and the Brookings Institution's Presidential Appointee Initiative. The book is available online, at www.appointee.brookings.org.

The Opportunity
For a great many, a presidential appointment marks the capstone of their careers. It opens opportunities that they never had before -- positions with even greater responsibilities in government or in the business or academic world they came from. Thinking of public service as a steppingstone, however, is a serious mistake. If the job you really have your eye on is the one that awaits you after your stint in government, you run a serious risk of fumbling your work on the public's behalf.

The Money
Your government salary may stay flat or grow very slowly during your time in office. Top law firms, for example, are hiring law school graduates today at salaries approaching what a deputy cabinet secretary makes. There are no stock options or bonuses for political appointees. And senior-level political appointees cannot moonlight. . . . The prohibition includes speaking fees.

The Paperwork
You'll need to tackle a pile of paperwork at the outset of the appointments process. . . . These forms are, as the 1992 National Academy of Sciences report put it, "separate, complicated and incompatible." Some nominees face more than one committee, and must fill out separate forms for each. . . . 
You will also be investigated by the F.B.I. (and, in some cases, questioned by Senate committee investigators as well). Embarrassing details of your life could become public. . . . Even if you never broke the law, you could find yourself facing public criticism for engaging in activities many years ago that seemed entirely harmless.

The Wait
Many officials remember this vetting process as a trying time, even though their names were moving forward. . . . "You're in limbo," says Louis Caldera, a graduate of West Point and Harvard Law School who served in the California Assembly before becoming Secretary of the Army in 1998. "You can't go ask people for business. You can't develop new business in good conscience when in fact you're thinking about leaving. So your whole life is in limbo; your kids' life is in limbo; your wife's life is in limbo. After a while, you say to yourself: 'I'm setting a deadline, and if they cannot tell me by this date that I am either the nominee or not the nominee. . . . I'm going to have to tell them I can't take the job anymore.' "

HEADLINE: The Wave Of Layoffs: Is It Bound To Get Bigger? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
ECONOMIC growth has ground nearly to a halt, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said last week. The 2000 holiday shopping season was the weakest in a decade. Announcements of layoffs reached their highest level last month in at least seven years, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a job placement firm in Chicago.
 Amid all the grimness, the December unemployment rate sat at 4 percent, only a tenth of a percentage point above its lowest level in 30 years. 
 The contrast is enough to befuddle anyone trying to figure out the current condition of the nation's labor market. The United States seems to be dangerously close to its first recession in 10 years, one that could again lead to hundreds of thousands of pink slips for blue- and white-collar workers. In the meantime, however, executives are still complaining that they cannot find enough qualified employees.
In part, the apparent contradiction reflects nothing more than timing. The low unemployment rate gives a picture of where the economy has been, not where it is going, and the number can distort reality during turning points in the economic cycle. As those announced layoffs take effect, the unemployment rate will start rising -- perhaps as soon as Friday, when the government releases the next jobs report.
"The economy slips first, and then the jobless rate goes up later," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist for Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.
That is not the entire story, though. The early evidence suggests that during this slowdown companies are relying heavily on cutbacks other than permanent layoffs. The question for workers -- many of whom have suddenly grown concerned about their jobs in the last two months, according to regular consumer surveys by the University of Michigan -- is whether this trend can withstand a prolonged downturn.
For now, while the jobless rate holds steady, the workweek is shrinking more quickly than it did at the start of the 1990-91 recession. In December, production employees -- about four-fifths of the work force -- logged almost 30 fewer minutes per week on average than they had in June. In the months leading up to the last recession, by contrast, weekly hours fell by half that amount, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Similarly, the number of people who want full-time work but can find only part-time jobs has risen in recent months, and the number of temporary workers has dropped.
Economists point to these developments as evidence that companies, chastened by becoming bloated in the 1980's and then laying off thousands of employees in the early 90's, are looking for another solution this time. Perhaps they now view some job cuts as too costly to employee morale. Or maybe they have read the demographic charts and decided that the upcoming mass retirement of baby boomers will cause a worker shortage in the decades ahead.
"There's a general sense still out there that the weak period is going to be short-lived," said Ethan Harris, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "If you fire people, you're going to have to hire them back six months later."
In such a situation, the surge in layoff announcements in December could be a blip. Job growth would continue to slow, and people outside the work force -- like mothers who stay at home with their children -- would stop joining at the rate they have in recent years. But the large majority of people looking for work would find it, keeping the unemployment rate fairly low, even through a downturn.
Judging from the strong recent gains in productivity -- the amount that a worker can produce in an hour -- companies have remained leaner through this expansion than they did in previous ones. Even when looking for places to cut, they may decide there are relatively few employees whom they can lay off.
But there is another side to the productivity increases, and economists say it could set the stage for another heavy round of downsizing.
If the downturn worsens and companies find that cutting overtime hours does not reduce costs as much as revenue growth is slowing, they will turn to job cuts, as they always have.
This time, though, they may do it before their sales actually start to fall. If productivity keeps rising, companies can keep growing even as they shrink their work forces, as long as the remaining employees continue to become more efficient and make up for the loss of their former colleagues.
The raft of recent layoff announcements -- from DaimlerChrysler, Xerox, Office Depot, Lucent Technologies and AOL Time Warner, among others -- could be just the beginning.
A mild version of the productivity-related cuts may already be happening. In the first quarter, Lehman Brothers predicts that the United States economy will grow 1 percent even as the number of hours worked falls 1 percent. Productivity gains will make up the difference.
The reduced hours are translating into less income. For the time being, however, the slowdown is coexisting with nearly full employment.

 BODY:
 EUROPE

BRITAIN: MANDELSON VOWS TO FIGHT
Peter Mandelson, who resigned from the government after admitting issuing a misleading statement about helping an Indian get a passport, has set off an argument with former cabinet colleagues by saying he was forced to quit under pressure on the basis of incomplete evidence. "I am not a liar," he said, vowing to clear his name. "This trivial error was turned into a huge misjudgment." Clare Short, secretary for international development, said: "He wasn't accurate, didn't speak the truth, let himself down and the government. Peter Mandelson is over." Warren Hoge (NYT)

MONTENEGRO: YUGOSLAV PRESENCE
The Yugoslav government opened an office in Podgorica, the Montenegrin capital, setting up a federal presence for the first time in years in the small independence-minded republic that along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. Montenegro, which has scheduled general elections for April and then a referendum on independence, described the move as "political aggression." Carlotta Gall (NYT)

KOSOVO: ETHNIC FLARE-UP
Violence flared in the divided town of Mitrovica in northern Kosovo as Serbs and Albanians attacked each other with grenades in a mixed area of the town that is heavily patrolled by international peacekeepers. One Albanian was killed and two were wounded and an Albanian house was set on fire in one of the worst incidents in months in the troubled town. Carlotta Gall (NYT)

GERMANY: ARMY BASES CLOSED
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping announced that 39 of 598 bases and 20 other smaller military installations would be closed by 2006 under plans to reduce Germany's military personnel from 310,000 to 282,000. The number of civilians working with the armed forces is to be reduced by about a third, to 85,000. Victor Homola (NYT)

FRANCE, ITALY: TRAIN TUNNEL
Italy and France agreed to start work on a multibillion-dollar high-speed rail link between Turin and Lyon, incorporating an environmentally contentious 32.5-mile tunnel through the scenic Alpine region of Valle di Susa. The two countries also settled a rift over the Mont Blanc tunnel by agreeing that it would reopen in September. It closed in March 1999 after a blaze in which 39 people died. (Reuters)

THE AMERICAS

CANADA: OFFICIAL VISIT BY BLAIR
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain will make his first official visit to Canada from Feb. 21 to 23 before flying to Washington to see President Bush. Mr. Blair is expected to discuss Canada's views on a proposed American missile defense system, which Ottawa fears could set off a nuclear arms race with Russia and China. James Brooke (NYT)

CUBA: TOP CZECH INVITED
A senior Czech official flew to Cuba at Fidel Castro's invitation in a bid to free two Czechs jailed for contacts with dissidents on behalf of the United States, the Foreign Ministry said. The visit of Petr Pithart, the Czech upper house chairman, is the first high-level contact between the two countries since the arrests of a former finance minister, Ivan Pilip, and a student leader, Jan Bubenik. (Reuters)

ASIA

MYANMAR: EUROPEANS VISIT
A European Union delegation began talks with military officials in a visit aimed at pressing the ruling junta to move toward democracy. Today it is expected to visit the opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under de facto house arrest. (Reuters)

KOREAS: NEW ROUND OF REUNIONS
Red Cross officials from the two Koreas agreed to a third round of reunions and exchange of letters for families divided for 50 years. The reunions of about 100 familes from each side will be held over three days from Feb. 26 and the letter exchange will be on March 15, a South Korean Red Cross spokesman said. (Reuters)

AFGHANISTAN: U.N. ENVOY VISITS
The United Nations special envoy for Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, arrived in Kabul to discuss with the ruling Taliban their harboring of the fugitive Saudi Osama bin Laden, among other matters. The Taliban's refusal to expel him and shut down guerrilla training camps led the Security Council on Jan. 18 to impose new sanctions on Afghanistan. Christopher S. Wren (NYT)

AFRICA

TANZANIA: REGAINING CONTROL
Security forces said they had regained control of Pemba and Zanzibar islands after three days of street battles with opposition protesters that left at least 40 people dead. As international condemnation of the authorities grew, some diplomats said Western aid to Tanzania could be affected. The fighting began after the opposition called demonstrations to demand a rerun of last October's discredited elections on Zanzibar, which has a semiautonomous status within Tanzania. (Reuters)

MIDDLE EAST

KUWAIT: GOVERNMENT QUITS
Kuwait's head of state accepted the resignation of his government after the prime minister asked to step down, saying the cabinet's work was being disrupted by unidentified obstacles. Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the emir, said in a decree: "The resignation of Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, the prime minister, and the ministers is accepted. Each of them carries out urgent matters in his post until the new government is formed." (Reuters)

IRAQ: ALLIED ATTACKS REPORTED
Iraq said seven people were hurt when Western planes attacked civilian targets in the south. There was no immediate comment from the United States or Britain, whose planes patrol no-flight zones set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. (Reuters)
